<text>Simo Häyhä (; 17December 1905 1April 2002), often referred to by his nickname The White Death (; ), was a Finnish military sniper during World War II in the 1939–1940 Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union. He used a Finnish-produced M/28-30 rifle (a variant of Mosin–Nagant) and a Suomi KP/-31 submachine gun. Häyhä is believed to have killed over 500 enemy soldiers during the conflict, the highest number of sniper kills in any major war. Consequently, he is generally regarded as the deadliest sniper in history.

Häyhä estimated in his private war memoir that he shot around 500 Soviet soldiers. Written in 1940 (a few months after he was wounded), his () describes his experiences in the Winter War from 30 November 1939 to 13 March 1940. Hidden for decades, the memoir was discovered in 2017.

== Early life, family and education ==
Häyhä was born on 17 December 1905 in the Kiiskinen hamlet of the Rautjärvi municipality in the Viipuri Province of southern Finland, near the border with Russia. He was the seventh of eight children in a Lutheran family of farmers. His father, Juho Häyhä, was the owner of the Mattila farm, while his mother, Katriina (née Vilkko), was a loving and hard-working farmer&#x27;s wife. He attended school in the village of Miettilä in Kivennapa parish and helped cultivate the home farm alongside his eldest brother. Before his military service, he was a farmer and enjoyed hunting and skiing.

===Militia and military training ===

Häyhä joined the Finnish voluntary militia, the Civil Guard (&quot;Suojeluskunta&quot;), at age 17. He excelled in shooting competitions in the Viipuri Province, and his home was reportedly filled with trophies for marksmanship. Not keen to hog the spotlight, he usually stood at the back in group photos during his youth, until his later successes forced him to take centre stage.

In 1925, at age 19, Häyhä began his 15-month compulsory military service in the Bicycle Battalion 2 in Raivola, Viipuri Province. He attended the Non-Commissioned Officer School and served as a conscript officer in the Bicycle Battalion 1 in Terijoki. However, he did not receive formal sniper training until 1938, a year before the war, at a training centre in Utti.

According to Major Tapio Saarelainen, who met Häyhä several times and has written five books about him, including his biography, Häyhä was able to estimate distances with an accuracy of up to .

== Winter War service ==

Häyhä served as a sniper in the Finnish Army during the 1939–40 Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, under Lieutenant Aarne Juutilainen in the 6th Company of Infantry Regiment 34 (, or &quot;JR 34&quot;) during the Battle of Kollaa in temperatures between . He was dressed completely in white camouflage; Soviet troops were not issued camouflage uniforms for most of the war, making them easily visible to snipers in winter conditions. Joseph Stalin had purged military experts in the late 1930s as part of the Great Purge, and as a result the Red Army was highly disorganized.

Finnish sources state that Häyhä was nicknamed &quot;The White Death&quot; by the Red Army (, ; ; ). The name &quot;White Death&quot; has been suggested to originate entirely in Finnish propaganda, rather than having been given to Häyhä by the Russians; according to information from prisoners, to the Russians &quot;White Death&quot; referred to a severe frost in the deep forest. Häyhä having the nickname &quot;White Death&quot; first appeared in the Finnish Winter War literature of the late 1980s. During the war, the &quot;White Death&quot; was one of the leading themes of Finnish propaganda. Finnish newspapers frequently featured the invisible Finnish soldier, thus creating a hero of mythical proportions. To add to the myth, he was also nicknamed &quot;The Magic Shooter&quot; among Finns (, in close reference to the Finnish word for &quot;sniper&quot;; ).

=== Achievements as a sniper ===

All of Häyhä&#x27;s kills were accomplished in less than 100 days, an average of five per day at a time of year with very few daylight hours. His kill count as a sniper was based on his own reporting, with the confirmation of his comrades, and only those who were verified to be dead were counted. No count was taken when several snipers shot at the same target. Enemy soldiers killed with a submachine gun with Häyhä as a group leader were not counted.

Häyhä&#x27;s division commander Antero Svensson credited him with 219 confirmed kills with a rifle and an equal number of kills by submachine gun, when he awarded Häyhä with an honorary rifle on 17 February 1940. On 21 December 1939, Häyhä achieved his highest daily count of 25 kills. In his diary, military chaplain Antti Rantamaa reported 259 confirmed kills made by rifle and an equal number of kills by submachine gun from the beginning of the war until 7 March 1940, one day after Häyhä was severely wounded.

Some of Häyhä&#x27;s figures are from a Finnish Army document, counted from the beginning of the war, 30 November 1939:
* 22 December 1939: 138 sniper kills in 22 days
* 26 January 1940: 199 sniper kills (61 in 35 days)
* 17 February 1940: 219 sniper kills (20 in 22 days)
* 7 March 1940 (one day after he was wounded): total of 259 sniper kills (40 in 18 days)

Häyhä never discussed it publicly, but his own private memoir, discovered in 2017, states a number. He begins by stating that &quot;this is his sin list&quot;, and estimates the total number he shot to be around 500.

Finnish historian Risto Marjomaa questions the large number, as confirmation of casualties was difficult due to the absence of the bodies. In his article, published by the &quot;National Biography of Finland&quot;, Marjomaa credited Häyhä with the total number of &quot;more than two hundred&quot; kills. Complicating matters further is the use of Häyhä&#x27;s achievements as a tool of propaganda: the Finnish press built a hero&#x27;s myth around Häyhä at the early stage of the war.

=== Firearms and tactics ===
Häyhä used his issued Civil Guard rifle, an early series SAKO M/28-30, serial number 35281, Civil Guard number S60974. It was a Finnish Civil Guard variant of the Mosin–Nagant rifle known as &quot;Pystykorva&quot; ( due to the front sight&#x27;s resemblance to the head of a spitz-type dog) chambered in the Finnish-designed Mosin–Nagant cartridge 7.62×53R. When fighting as a group leader with the rest of his unit, he used a Suomi KP/-31 submachine gun.

Häyhä preferred iron sights over telescopic sights, as they enable a sniper to present a smaller target for the enemy (a sniper must raise his head a few centimetres higher when using a telescopic sight), and can be relied on even in extreme cold, unlike telescopic sights which tend to cloud up in cold weather. Another disadvantage of telescopic sights is that sunlight may reflect off the lenses and reveal the sniper&#x27;s position. Häyhä did not have prior training with scoped rifles, and therefore preferred not to switch to the Soviet scoped rifle (M/91-30 PE or PEM).

Häyhä dealt with the intense cold by dressing properly with multiple layers of clothing. He kept sugar and bread in his pockets, consuming them for the calories necessary to keep his body warm. His slight stature of assisted him in disguising his position. Hidden in a snow pit, he could lie still and observe the enemy for long periods of time. It was Häyhä&#x27;s custom to move, well before daybreak, to the position he had prepared, and stay there until after sunset. He would frequently pack dense mounds of snow in front of his position to conceal himself, provide padding for his rifle, and reduce the characteristic puff of snow stirred up by the muzzle blast. He was known to keep snow in his mouth while sniping to prevent his breath in the cold air from giving away his position.

=== Injury ===

On 6 March 1940, just a week before the end of the war, Häyhä was severely wounded when an explosive bullet fired by a Red Army soldier tore through his face and shattered his lower left jaw. After the battle, as he appeared to be dead, he was placed on a pile of corpses. Someone later noticed his foot moving and he was removed from the pile and taken to hospital.

Rumours of Häyhä&#x27;s death spread throughout Finland and the Soviet Union. He regained consciousness a week later, on 13 March, the day peace was declared. Reading about his own death in a newspaper, he sent a letter to the paper to correct the misunderstanding.

Recovery took considerable time and required extensive treatment and multiple surgeries, leaving visible scars that remained for the rest of his life. Despite this, when the Continuation War (1941–1944) broke out, he requested permission to return to the front lines. However, due to the severity of his facial injuries, from which he was still recovering, his request was denied. Häyhä spent the Continuation War on the home front, tending to his farm.

In his private war memoir, written a few months after he was wounded, Häyhä recorded several brief accounts from the Winter War. Discovered decades later, one anecdote describes an incident involving the capture of a Soviet soldier by his unit: &quot;After Christmas, we captured a Russkie, blindfolded him, spun him around until he was disoriented, and took him to a feast in the tent of the Terror of Morocco. The Russkie was content with the revelry, but when he was sent back, it felt very repugnant to him.&quot;

== Honours ==

Häyhä was awarded the First and Second class Medals of Liberty, as well as the Third and Fourth class Crosses of Liberty. The latter two were normally granted to only commissioned officers. As an additional honour, on 17 February 1940, he received a nameplated SAKO M/28-30 “Pystykorva” Honorary Rifle (serial number 100 781), donated by Eugen Johansson, a Swedish businessman and supporter of Finland. According to an unofficial count, he had shot 219 Red Army soldiers at the time. He later donated the rifle to the Karelia Jaeger Battalion&#x27;s Heritage Room, from where it was transferred to the Finnish Military Museum&#x27;s collection after the dissolution of the North Karelia Brigade in 2013.

Shortly after the Winter War, on 28 August 1940, Finnish Field Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim promoted Häyhä straight from alikersantti (the lowest military rank of a non-commissioned officer) to vänrikki (the first military rank of an officer). In 1941, Häyhä was also nominated as a Knight of the Mannerheim Cross, the most distinguished Finnish military honour. However, due to administrative reasons, the knighthood was not granted, as the cross was not awarded to anyone solely for achievements in the Winter War. He also received the Kollaa fighters&#x27; medal, the silver version of the Cross of Kollaa Battle, number 4 of 4.

The Kollaa and Simo Häyhä Museum (Kollaa ja Simo Häyhä -museo) is located in the village of Miettilä at Rautjärvi, in a former infirmary. The museum, opened in 1983, covers the Battle of Kollaa, and features a special permanent exhibition dedicated to the life of Simo Häyhä.

In the 2004 &quot;Suuret suomalaiset&quot; (Great Finns) television show and poll, which determined the &quot;100 greatest Finns of all time&quot;, Häyhä was ranked 74th.

== Post-war life ==

It took several years for Häyhä to recuperate from his wound. Although his face remained disfigured, he otherwise made a full recovery. Häyhä&#x27;s family farm was located in the territory ceded in the peace agreement, forcing him to start his life over in Valkjärvi (&quot;Whitelake&quot;), Ruokolahti, a small municipality in southeastern Finland, near the Russian border, where he worked as a farmer. In addition to farming, he enjoyed hunting, and his hunting parties over the years included the President of Finland, Urho Kekkonen. He became a successful moose hunter and dog breeder. Häyhä also served as a long-time board member of the Kollaa Fighters&#x27; Brotherhood, formed after the Winter War in May 1940.

However, some people did not approve of his actions during the Winter War; he was met with hate and even death threats. The injuries he sustained in the war left recognizable facial scars, so as a well-known person, he avoided large groups of people. He never married, and lived as a bachelor. He enjoyed working, but he suffered from loneliness and fear; nights were especially difficult for him. However, he had friends and also spent time at his parents&#x27; and siblings&#x27; homes after the war. Eventually farm work became too difficult, so he put the farm up for rent, and moved to an apartment building in the centre of Ruokolahti.

Häyhä was known as a modest man who never boasted of his wartime merits. He rarely spoke of the war and his experiences. When asked in 1998 how he had become such a good sniper, he replied simply: &quot;Practice&quot;. In an Independence Day interview with &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; in December 2001, shortly before his 96th birthday, Häyhä opened up about his war experiences. He was asked if he felt remorse for having killed so many people. He replied, &quot;I did what I was told, as well as I could. There would be no Finland unless everyone had done the same.&quot;

Häyhä spent his last years in a war veterans&#x27; nursing home in Hamina, where he died on 1 April 2002, aged 96. He was buried in his home town of Ruokolahti.

== In popular culture ==
Swedish heavy metal band Sabaton composed the song &quot;White Death&quot; in honor of Häyhä, which was released in 2010 on their album &quot;Coat of Arms&quot;. Scottish black/thrash metal band Achren&#x27;s three-song &quot;The White Death&quot; EP from 2014 is dedicated entirely to Häyhä, right down to the cover art. Japanese metal band To Mega Therion has made a song called &quot;Simo Hayha&quot;, which appears on the 2015 &quot;Yog = Sothoth&quot; album.

In 2011, Philip Kaufman began filming HBO&#x27;s &quot;Hemingway &amp; Gellhorn&quot; (first airdate 28 May 2012), which features Martha Gellhorn (played by Nicole Kidman) reporting from Finland during the Winter War. In this section, Steven Wiig portrays Häyhä, leading a group of Finnish soldiers to shelter. A film about Häyhä called &quot;The White Death&quot; has also been planned since 2017. The film is directed by David McElroy and written by James Poirier.

According to Jalmari Helander, who wrote and directed the script for the 2022 action film &quot;Sisu&quot;, the film is partly inspired by Häyhä&#x27;s legendary reputation.

American author Arna Bontemps Hemenway has written a short story about Häyhä, called &quot;Wolves of Karelia&quot;, which was published in the August 2019 issue of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine. Häyhä also appears in the 2024 novel &quot;Les Guerriers de l&#x27;hiver&quot; by Olivier Norek.

Häyhä&#x27;s story has been adapted in two manga, in one called &quot;The White Witch&quot; (, &quot;Shiroi Majo&quot;) by Nagakawa Naruki, the main character is named Simo Häyhä, but is female. He also appears in the manga &quot;Record of Ragnarok&quot; (, &quot;Shūmatsu no Warukyūre&quot;) by Shinya Umemura and Takumi Fukui, in which he is depicted as a fighter for humanity.

<text>Earl of March Secondary School is an Ottawa-Carleton District School Board secondary school in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located in suburban Kanata in the Beaverbrook neighbourhood near the Ottawa Public Library Beaverbrook Branch and the John G. Mlacak Centre. The school also serves the neighbourhoods of Kanata Lakes, Beaverbrook, Katimavik-Hazeldean, Richardson Ridge, and Morgan&#x27;s Grant.

== History ==
The Earl of March Secondary School opened on December 6, 1971, and was the only secondary school in the area that would become the City of Kanata (later to be amalgamated within the City of Ottawa). The school was designed by Balharrie, Helmer, and Gibson architects and engineers for the Carleton Board of Education (which became part of the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board) and was built for . The school featured a 750-seat auditorium, a large gymnasium with a balcony, a smaller exercise gym, a large cafeteria, a library, specialized science, technology, and arts rooms; as well as several &quot;flexible&quot; learning spaces. The school took its name from Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond and Earl of March, who served as Governor General of British North America in the early 19th century.

When the school opened, the Earl of March&#x27;s catchment area was a large part of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa–Carleton, encompassing March, Huntley, Torbolton, and Fitzroy townships and part of Goulbourn Township. As such, Earl of March served for many years as the sole high school for Ottawa&#x27;s then-nascent northwestern suburbs outside the Greenbelt. As Kanata started to rapidly expand in the late 1970s to the 1990s, other high schools were built and the catchment area was made smaller to prevent excessive over-crowding. Today, the Earl of March is one of five public high schools, three Catholic high schools, and several private high schools that now facilitate the area.

The school has undergone several renovations and additions, the first major one being in 1979 when an elevator, a wheel-chair ramp, and several mechanical doors were added into the building to make it wheel-chair accessible, as well as a renovation to the auditorium and arts wing to add more storage space and a better sound system.

In the 1980s, the auditorium, library, arts wing and tech wings were renovated to add more music rooms to the school to facilitate the school&#x27;s large music program. The old music room which shared space with the back section of the stage was removed, the old art and drama rooms were turned into two new music rooms and a group practice room was turned into a keyboard lab for a keyboard classes (which has since been turned back into a group practice space). The art rooms were moved to two new classrooms added at the back of the library, making it significantly smaller, and the drama room was moved to the old mechanical drafting room.

During the 1990s, the tech department was renovated to better accommodate the new drama room, as well as better safety systems, a wood-working lab, a metal-working lab (including welding) and a machine shop. The second floor of the school also received renovations, adding five new computer labs to the building and adjusting the layout of some of the internal classrooms to accommodate. Several of the flexible classroom spaces were removed during this period.

In 2002 the auditorium was renovated again, the stage was made larger on either side, the last remains of the old music room were taken out, new seats were added in one of the lecture theatres and one of the seating sections, as well as a new stage light dimming system was installed.

In 2009, the science classrooms were renovated to fix possible gas and water leaks in the old wooden benches and desks, as well as to remove safety issues regarding climbing stairs with chemicals. The old science rooms were similar to the lecture theatres, with rows, each on a step higher than the last, of wooden benches and desks. The new science rooms feature lab-grade counters forming a U-shape around the outside of the room facing in towards the centre where labs can be completed. The centre of the room contains regular desks for note-taking, and the front of the room has the teachers counter as well as smart boards for writing notes. The new science rooms also feature proper fume-hoods for handling chemicals, which are sometimes used by the computer technology department for soldering.

In 2014 the school received funding for a new $17 million wing for grades seven and eight which officially opened, along with a new office and guidance department, on December 3, 2015, despite having been in use since the start of the school year as of early September 2015. The wing was created in order to relieve over-crowding from two feeder schools. The new two-story wing features 25 classrooms, a double gymnasium, two music rooms, and a drama room. It shares the cafeteria, library, computer labs, an auditorium with the high school. The new wing has already elected its own student council, put on its own musical, created its own band and arts programs, and has started several other traditions. The office and guidance spaces were created on the first floor, directly below where they used to be on the second. The old office and guidance spaces were turned into an exercise gym and a community living class respectively. The new office contains 10 new offices for principals and councillors, a meeting room, new working areas for the office secretaries and guidance technician, better storage and archive space, a new PA system for the school to replace the old original one. The entire area is laid out to optimize the tight space. This new wing means the Earl of March is the first school in the OCDSB to switch from a 9-12 to a 7-12 and the second school to follow the 7-12 model.

Over the summer of 2017, several classrooms on the second story were renovated to accommodate the Earl&#x27;s growing science department. These science rooms have the same layout and configuration as the science rooms renovated in 2009. As part of the renovation, a computer lab was relocated to an empty classroom at the end of the hall. The school took the opportunity to refresh the computer science and technology learning in the school, and turn the new computer lab into a modern technology learning area.

During the new year of 2019, the school experienced damages due to flooding in the science labs. The pipes froze &amp; burst during the winter break as the heating was turned off while students were not attending school. As a consequence, the school was closed for an extra day to resolve the issues.

== Academics and athletics ==
The school was one of the first in the Ottawa area to offer French immersion instruction at the secondary level, as well as the first school in Ontario to offer an Advanced Placement (AP) program.

Earl of March features a large 750 seat auditorium. Four sections of the auditorium can be partitioned off into lecture theatres that can be used as classrooms. During the 1970s and 1980s, the auditorium was used by the Kanata Theatre before building their own theatre; it was also used during the 1980s by Kanata United Church before they built their own building. The auditorium is used for things such as meetings, school assemblies, concert band practices, and concerts, as well as the yearly school musical.

Earl of March sports teams go by the nickname of the Lions. Many sports are offered.

<doc id="410615" wikidata="Q118875176" url="?curid=410615" title="Sargam notes">
<text>Sargam (from SA-RE-GA-MA), a technique for the teaching of sight-singing, is the Hindustani or North Indian equivalent to the western solfege. Sargam is practiced against a drone and the emphasis is not on the scale but on the intervals, thus it may be considered just intonation. The same notes are also used in South Indian Carnatic music.

The notes, or &quot;swar&quot;, are Shadj, Rishabh, Gandhara, Madhyam, Pancham, Dhaivat, Nishad. When singing these become Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni, and sargam stands for &quot;Sa-Re-Ga-Ma&quot;. Only these syllables are sung, and further designations are never vocalized. When writing these become, S, R, G, M, P, D, N. A dot above a letter indicates the octave higher, a dot below the octave lower. A line below a letter indicates it is flat or &quot;komal&quot;, an acute accent above a letter indicates it is sharp or &quot;tivar&quot;. In some notation systems, the distinction is made with capital and lowercase letters. Natural is called &quot;shudda&quot;. Re, Ga, Dha, and Ni may be either shudda or komal; Ma may be either shudda or tivar and is then called tivra Ma. Sa and Pa are immovable (once Sa is selected), forming a just perfect fifth.

In certain forms of Indian classical and qawwali, when a rapid, 16th note sequence of the same note is to be sung, sometimes different syllables are used in a certain sequence to make the whole easier to pronounce. For example instead of &quot;sa sa sa sa sa&quot; said really quickly, it might be &quot;sadadalisadadali&quot; which lends itself more to a quick and light tongue movement.

Also see Carnatic music, swara.

<doc id="410636" wikidata="Q3151867" url="?curid=410636" title="Glebe Collegiate Institute">
<text>Glebe Collegiate Institute (GCI) is a high school in the Glebe neighbourhood of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Administered by the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (OCDSB), Glebe Collegiate Institute has approximately 1,700 students and is the district&#x27;s largest school.

Students and sports teams are referred to as &quot;Gryphons.&quot;

Glebe was selected as one of Canada&#x27;s best schools in the August 23, 2004, edition of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; news magazine.

The school offers specialized programs, such as French immersion, English as a second language, bilingual, gifted, and a learning disability and special education learning centre.

Glebe has a percussion group called Offbeat, which uses things like trash cans, brooms, chalk dusters, and water barrels as instruments. The school&#x27;s Improv teams have twice placed within the Canadian Improv Games national finals. Glebe&#x27;s robotics program participates in US FIRST international robotics competition, and won the SKILLS Canada STEM and Controls competition in 2015. They also have a student lead band called Ventana.

Glebe&#x27;s Reach for the Top trivia team has won the national championships twice, during the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 school years.

From 2012 through 2017, the Glebe Girls&#x27; Cross Country Team won 5 consecutive Overall OFSAA XC Titles, winning back to back Senior Girls titles in 2015 and 2016.

In 2008 and 2010, a group of four science teachers (Andrew Cumberland, Dan Lajoie, Colin Harris, and Masato Kachi) from Glebe placed second in Canada in the Discovery Channel&#x27;s Iron Science Competition.

== History ==
The school was founded not as an independent entity but as an expansion of the Ottawa Collegiate Institute. In 1919 the Adolescent School Attendance Act had made attending school compulsory until age 16, leading to a dramatic rise in secondary school enrolment. The OCI had outgrown its existing facility (now Lisgar Collegiate Institute) and constructed a new facility on what was then the outskirts of the city. The construction of &quot;Ottawa Collegiate Institute, Glebe Building&quot; was a slow process, and classes began in 1922 before it was complete, causing some inconveniences for students. Symbols of the OCI continue to adorn the entrance to the school. The building was officially opened in 1923.

The rivalry between Glebe and Lisgar Collegiate Institute commenced soon after the division of the OCI. In one incident, a banquet was held at the Glebe building that included student clubs from both schools. In the middle of the meal, a food fight erupted between the two groups and only an enraged principal could persuade students to stop.

In 1974, Glebe Collegiate Institute concert and stage bands produced an album, &quot;Something gold... Something blue&quot;, and in 1978 produced a second album, &quot;Glebe Stage Band&quot;.

Glebe Collegiate Institute was used in the filming of the 2008 Canadian-American drama film &quot;The Perfect Assistant&quot;. 

In the 2012–2013 school year, $9,000 was raised for cancer research, more than $17,000 for the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) as well as the largest food donation ever to the Centre Town Emergency Food bank. 

Students at Glebe Collegiate Institute during the 2010-2020 decade would sometimes help set up and take down a temporary dome at a nearby exhibition centre during the winter. In exchange, the company that owned the dome would let school sports teams at Glebe use the dome for practices. In later years, the aforementioned company would offer to build a turf field and another temporary dome on Glebe property for free, but the school board refused to give approval and construction was never started.

On October 19, 2017, Glebe Collegiate Institute went into lockdown after a gun and a bullet were found on school grounds. A young man was arrested, but there were no injuries.

Glebe Collegiate Institute&#x27;s Reach for the Top trivia team won the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 national championships. The competitions were held online due to COVID-19. 

== Facility ==
Constructed in the early 20th century, the school has an old-fashioned architectural style that has been kept consistent despite additions to the building. The school has recently gone through extensive renovations in its science department to make the labs the most modern in the school district. Notable features of the building include an auditorium with balcony seating, a subbasement dedicated wholly to an orchestral music room, instrument storage, and the music teachers&#x27; office, and a small greenhouse on the roof, which few students have been to. The school once included an underground swimming pool, but it has been closed. The school is a Wi-Fi hotspot, and all students and teachers have access to the internet via wireless devices and computers. However, apart from the computer labs, Glebe still lacks air conditioning. Glebe has a full-size playing field that is used for a variety of high school sports like soccer, football, and baseball. Around the field, there are track and field running facilities with two full supporter stands.

<doc id="410649" wikidata="Q1192695" url="?curid=410649" title="Caning">
<text>Caning is a form of corporal punishment consisting of a number of hits (known as &quot;strokes&quot; or &quot;cuts&quot;) with a single cane usually made of rattan, generally applied to the offender&#x27;s bare or clothed buttocks (see spanking) or hands (on the palm). Caning on the knuckles or shoulders is much less common. Caning can also be applied to the soles of the feet (foot whipping or bastinado). The size and flexibility of the cane and the mode of application, as well as the number of the strokes, may vary.

Flagellation as punishment was so common in England that caning, along with spanking and whipping, were called &quot;le vice anglais&quot; or &quot;the English vice&quot;. Caning can also be done consensually as part of BDSM.

The thin cane generally used for corporal punishment is not to be confused with the walking stick, which is sometimes also called &quot;cane&quot; (especially in American English), but is thicker and much more rigid, and usually made of stronger wood.

==Scope of use==
Caning was a common form of judicial punishment and official school discipline in many parts of the world in the 19th and 20th centuries. Corporal punishment (with a cane or any other implement) has now been outlawed in much, but not all, of Europe. However, caning remains legal in numerous other countries in home, school, religious, judicial or military contexts, and is also in common use in some countries where it is no longer legal.

==Judicial corporal punishment==


Judicial caning, administered with a long, heavy rattan and much more severe than the canings given in schools, was/is a feature of some British colonial judicial systems, though the cane was never used judicially in Britain itself (the specified implements there, until abolition in 1948, being the birch and the cat-o&#x27;-nine-tails). In some countries caning is still in use in the post-independence era, particularly in Southeast Asia (where it is now being used far more than it was under British rule), and in some African countries.

The practice is retained, for male offenders only, under the criminal law in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. (In Malaysia there is also a separate system of religious courts for Muslims only, which can order a much milder form of caning for women as well as men.) Caning in Indonesia is a recent introduction, in the special case of Aceh, on Sumatra, which since its 2005 autonomy has introduced a form of sharia law for Muslims, as well as non-Muslims since 2014 if they choose to do it with the Acehnese Qanun (male or female), applying the cane to the clothed upper back of the offender.

African countries still using judicial caning include Botswana, Tanzania, Nigeria (mostly in northern states, but few cases have been reported in southern states) and, for juvenile offenders only, Eswatini and Zimbabwe. Other countries that used it until the late 20th century, generally only for male offenders, included Kenya, Uganda and South Africa, while some Caribbean countries such as Trinidad and Tobago use birching, another punishment in the British tradition, involving the use of a bundle of branches, not a single cane.

In Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei, healthy males under 50 years of age can be sentenced to a maximum of 24 strokes of the &quot;rotan&quot; (rattan) cane on the bare buttocks; the punishment is mandatory for many offences, mostly violent or drug crimes, but also immigration violations, sexual offences and (in Singapore) acts of vandalism. It is also imposed for certain breaches of prison rules. In Aceh, caning can be imposed for adultery. The punishment is applied to locals alike.

Two examples of the caning of foreigners which received worldwide media scrutiny are the canings in Singapore in 1994 of Michael P. Fay, an American student who had vandalised several automobiles, and in the United Arab Emirates in 1996 of Sarah Balabagan, a Filipina maid convicted of homicide.

Caning is also used in the Singapore Armed Forces to punish serious offences against military discipline, especially in the case of recalcitrant young conscripts. Unlike judicial caning, this punishment is delivered to the soldier&#x27;s clothed buttocks. See Military caning in Singapore.

A more moderate variation, where the caning is aimed at the soles of a culprit&#x27;s bare feet is used as prison punishment in several countries of the world.

==School corporal punishment==
The frequency and severity of caning in educational settings have varied greatly, often being determined by the written rules or unwritten traditions of the school. The western educational use of caning dates principally to the late nineteenth century. It gradually replaced birching—effective only if applied to the bare bottom—with a form of punishment more suited to contemporary sensibilities, once it had been discovered that a flexible rattan cane can provide the offender with a substantial degree of pain even when delivered through a layer of clothing.

Caning as a school punishment is strongly associated in the English-speaking world with England, but it was also used in other European countries in earlier times, notably Scandinavia, Germany and the countries of the former Austrian empire.

Member states of the Convention on the Rights of the Child are obliged to &quot;take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse.&quot;

=== In modern-day schools ===
Caning as a school punishment is still routine in a number of former British territories including Singapore, Malaysia and Zimbabwe. It is also common in some countries where it is technically illegal, including Thailand, Kenya, Vietnam and South Korea.

Until relatively recently it had also been common in Australia (now banned in public schools, and abolished in practice by the vast majority of all independent schools), New Zealand (banned in 1990), and South Africa (banned in public and private schools alike from 1996). In the UK, all corporal punishment in private schools was banned in 1999 for England and Wales, 2000 in Scotland, and 2003 in Northern Ireland.

==== Malaysia ====
In Malaysia, the Education Ordinance 1957 specifically outlaws the caning of girls in school. However, the caning of girls is rather common. This caning is usually carried out on the palm or clothed bottom. Sometimes, the cane can hit the student&#x27;s thighs or arms, causing injury, usually in the form of bruises, bleeding, or obvious welts. Students (both male and female) can even be caned publicly for minor mistakes like lateness, poor grades, being unable to answer questions correctly or forgetting to bring a textbook. In November 2007, in response to a perceived increase in indiscipline among female students, the National Seminar on Education Regulations (Student Discipline) passed a resolution recommending allowing the caning of female students at school. The resolution is currently in its consultation process.

=== In UK schools (in the past) ===
Historically, in many state and private schools in England, Scotland and Wales, the rattan cane was regularly used across the hands, legs, or buttocks of both boys and girls.

In some schools, corporal punishment was administered solely by the headmaster, while in others the task was delegated to other teachers.

The cane was generally administered in a formal ceremony in public/private to the seat of the trousers or skirt, typically with the student either bending over a desk/chair or touching their toes. Usually there was a maximum of six strokes (known as &quot;six of the best&quot;). Such a caning would typically leave the offender with uncomfortable weals and bruises lasting for many days after the immediate intense pain had worn off.

Elsewhere, other implements prevailed, such as the tawse in Scotland and Northern England, ruler, and the slipper.

Girls were caned too, but generally less frequently than boys. According to a 1976–1977 survey done by the Inner London Inspection Authority&#x27;s Inspectors, almost 1 in 5 girls were caned at least once in the authority&#x27;s schools alone. Caning in schools for girls was much rarer but not unknown.

Caning in British state schools in the later 20th century was often, in theory at least, administered by the head teacher only. Canings for primary school age pupils at state schools in this period could be extremely rare; one study found that over an eight-year timespan, one head teacher had only caned two boys in total, but made more frequent use of slippering, while another had caned no pupils at all.

Corporal punishment was abolished in state funded schools in 1987. All corporal punishment in private schools was banned in 1999 for England and Wales, 2000 in Scotland, and 2003 in Northern Ireland.

==== Prefectorial caning ====
In many English and Commonwealth private schools, authority to punish was traditionally also given to certain senior students (often called prefects). In the early 20th century, permission for prefects to cane younger students (mainly secondary-age boys) was also widespread in British public schools. Some private preparatory schools relied heavily on &quot;self-government&quot; by prefects for even their youngest pupils (around eight years old), with caning the standard punishment for even minor offences. The perceived advantages of this were to avoid bothering the teaching staff with minor disciplinary matters, promptness of punishment, and more effective chastisement, as the impact would be better known in the culprit&#x27;s immediate peer group. Canings from prefects took place for a wide variety of failings, including lack of enthusiasm in sport, or to enforce youngsters&#x27; participation in character-building aspects of public school life, such as compulsory cold baths in winter. Roald Dahl gives an account of this practice in his memoir Boy (autobiography) from his time in Repton School where prefects were referred to as &quot;Boazers&quot; and their underling students as &quot;fags&quot;.

Some British private schools still permitted caning to be administered by prefects in the 1960s, with opportunities for it provided by complex sets of rules on school uniform and behaviour. In 1969, when the question was raised in Parliament, it was thought that relatively few schools still permitted this.

As early as the 1920s, the tradition of prefects at British public schools repeatedly caning new boys for trivial offences was criticised by psychologists as producing &quot;a high state of nervous excitement&quot; in some of the youngsters subjected to it. It was felt that granting untrained and unsupervised older adolescents the power to impose comprehensive thrashings on their younger schoolmates whenever they chose might have adverse psychological effects.

Like their British counterparts, South African private schools also gave prefects free rein to administer canings whenever they felt it appropriate, from at least the late 19th century onwards. South African schools continued to use the cane to emphasise sporting priorities well into the late 20th century, caning boys for commonplace gameplay errors such as being caught offside in an association football match, as well as for poor batting performance in cricket, not applauding their school team&#x27;s performance sufficiently, missing sport practice sessions, or even &quot;to build up team spirit&quot;. The use of corporal punishment within the school setting was prohibited by the South African Schools Act of 1996. According to Chapter 2 Section 10 of the act, &quot;(1) No person may administer corporal punishment at a school to a learner&quot; and &quot;(2) Any person who contravenes subsection (1) is guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a sentence, which could be imposed for assault.&quot;

==== Reformatory caning ====
From 1933 to 1970, the cane was frequently used on boy inmates and less routinely for girl inmates at the youth reformatories in England and Wales known as approved schools. Many UK approved schools were known for strict discipline, with corporal punishment used where necessary, generally a rather more severe version of the caning (or in Scotland, strapping) that was common in ordinary secondary schools.

Under the Approved School Rules 1933, girls under 15 could be caned only on the hands; girls of 15 and over were not to be given caning at all. Boys under 15 could be caned on the hands or the bottom; boys of 15 and over were to be caned only on the clothed buttocks.

Before the 1933 rules, there was a case where several teenage girls were severely beaten with a tawse up to 12 strokes on the seat, with their skirts lifted up.

At the approved schools between 1933 and 1970, the normal maximum number of strokes was eight for boys of 15 and over, and six for boys and girls below that age. In particular, boys who absconded were typically given a maximum caning of 8 strokes on the clothed bottom immediately on return to the school, and a 1971 statistical study found that this could be an effective deterrent.

From 1970, approved schools became &quot;Community Homes with Education&quot; (CHEs) under the Children and Young Persons Act 1969. The national 1933 rules were replaced by local rules drawn up by each local authority. Girl residents of some post-1970 CHEs might as a result sometimes be caned on the buttocks instead of the hands. In some cases boys or girls of all ages were caned, in spite of a government recommendation that over-16s should no longer be caned.

Caning is still used in the equivalent institutions in some countries, such as Singapore and Guyana.

==== In children&#x27;s institutes ====
Corporal punishment at children&#x27;s homes was less severe. The &quot;Administration of Children&#x27;s Homes Regulations 1951&quot; (S.O. No 1217) provided that children under 10 should be punished only on their hands either by the headmaster or in his presence and direction.

Only girls under 10 and boys under the school leaving age (15 at that time) could be corporally punished. Children under 10 should be punished only on their hands. A boy over 10 but under 15 could be caned up to a maximum of six strokes on the clothed buttocks.

==Domestic corporal punishment==
Some parents cane their children as a punishment for reasons like disobedience or poor results. This is a common practice in some Asian countries such as Singapore and Malaysia.

In Singapore, canes for domestic use are regularly sold in grocery stores. There is usually increased demand for canes when students prepare for examinations, as canes are used more often, resulting in breakages.

==Effects==
Caning with a heavy judicial rattan as used in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei can leave scars for years if a large number of strokes are inflicted.

Most ordinary canings with a typical light rattan (used at home or at school for punishing students), although painful at the time, leave only reddish welts or bruises lasting a few days. Charles Chenevix Trench was caned as a boy at Winchester College in the early 1930s and later said that &quot;it was, of course, disagreeable, but left no permanent scars on my personality or my person&quot;.

When caning was still widespread in schools in the United Kingdom, it was perceived that a caning on the hand carried a greater risk of injury than a caning on the buttocks; in 1935 an Exeter schoolboy won £1 in damages (), plus his medical expenses, from a schoolmaster, when the county court decided that an abscess that developed on his hand was the result of a caning.

<doc id="410657" wikidata="Q495961" url="?curid=410657" title="Marquess of Huntly">
<text>Marquess of Huntly is a title in the Peerage of Scotland that was created on 17 April 1599 for George Gordon, 6th Earl of Huntly. It is the oldest existing marquessate in Scotland, and the second-oldest in the British Isles; only the English marquessate of Winchester is older. The Marquess holds the following subsidiary titles: Lord Gordon of Strathaven and Glenlivet and Earl of Aboyne (1660; Peerage of Scotland), and Baron Meldrum, of Morven in the County of Aberdeen (1815; Peerage of the United Kingdom).

==Early family history==
The Gordon family descends from Sir Adam Gordon of Huntly, killed at the Battle of Humbleton Hill in 1402 and succeeded in his estates by his daughter Elizabeth Gordon, wife of Alexander Seton, who assumed the surname of Gordon for himself and &quot;all his heirs male.&quot; He was created Earl of Huntly in the Peerage of Scotland in 1445 and was succeeded by his son, the second Earl, who served as Lord Chancellor of Scotland from 1498 to 1501. His younger son, the Hon. Adam Gordon, married Elizabeth, &quot;suo jure&quot; Countess of Sutherland. Their grandson, John Gordon, succeeded his grandmother in the earldom in 1535 (see Earl of Sutherland for further history about this branch of the family).

Lord Huntly&#x27;s elder son, the third Earl, was a member of the Council of Regency in 1517. He was succeeded by his grandson, the fourth Earl, Lord Chancellor of Scotland from 1546 to 1562, who was killed in the latter year, and in 1563 an Act of Attainder was passed through Parliament with all his titles forfeited. His eldest surviving son, George Gordon, was condemned to death for treason in 1563 but later pardoned. He obtained a reversal of his father&#x27;s attainder in 1567 and served as Lord Chancellor of Scotland.

George Gordon, became the 1st Marquess, he was the son of the 5th earl; born in 1562, educated in France as a Roman Catholic. He was part of a plot to conspire against King James VI. He worked as captain of the guard of Holyrood before the discovery of treason. He went about clan feuds and started a private war, this inspired the ballad The Bonnie Earl O&#x27; Moray. He was succeeded by his son. Earl of Enzie and Marquess of Huntly in the Peerage of Scotland. His son was raised protestant in England; in the civil war he became a royalist and in 1647 was given a pardon for his actions, yet later beheaded. He was succeeded by his elder son, the second Marquess.

==17th century onward==
In 1632, four years before his father&#x27;s death, the seventh Earl was created Viscount Aboyne in the Peerage of Scotland in his own right, with remainder that the title should be passed on to his second son the Hon. James Gordon on his death or on the death of his father, whichever came first.

When he died two years later the titles passed to his son, the third Marquess. In 1661 the attainder of 1649 was revoked by Act of Parliament. In 1684 Lord Huntly was created Lord Badenoch, Lochaber, Strathavon, Balmore, Auchindoun, Garthie and Kincardine, Viscount of Inverness, Earl of Huntly and Enzie and Duke of Gordon. All four titles were in the Peerage of Scotland. He was succeeded by his son, the second Duke. He was a supporter of the Old Pretender. Gordon married Lady Henrietta, daughter of Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough and 8th Baron Mordaunt. Their eldest son, the third Duke, sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1747 to 1752. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Duke. Known as &quot;Cock o&#x27; the North&quot;, he was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1767 to 1784 and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire and as Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland. In 1784 he was created Baron Gordon of Huntley, in the County of Gloucester, and Earl of Norwich, in the County of Norfolk, in the Peerage of Great Britain. Gordon&#x27;s great-grandfather, the first Duke, was the husband of Lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of Lord Henry Howard, who had been created Baron Howard of Castle Rising in 1669 and Earl of Norwich in 1672. The earldom of Norwich had become extinct on the death of the fourth Earl (also the ninth Duke of Norfolk) in 1777 and was now revived in Gordon&#x27;s favour. In 1819 Gordon also inherited the barony of Mordaunt through his grandmother.

His son, the fifth Duke, was a general in the Army and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire and as Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland. In 1807 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Gordon of Huntley. Gordon died without legitimate issue in 1836 when the dukedom and remaining titles created in 1684 as well as the titles created in 1784 became extinct. The barony of Mordaunt fell into abeyance between his sisters. Gordon&#x27;s eldest sister, Lady Charlotte Gordon, inherited the Gordon estates. Her son Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond, assumed the additional surname of Gordon. In 1875, the dukedom of Gordon was revived when his son Charles Henry Gordon-Lennox, 6th Duke of Richmond, was made Duke of Gordon in the Peerage of the United Kingdom (see the Duke of Richmond for further history of these titles). The Duke of Gordon was succeeded in the marquessate of Huntly by his kinsman George Gordon, 5th Earl of Aboyne, who became the ninth Marquess (see the Earl of Aboyne for earlier history of this branch of the family). However, the House of Lords did not allow his claims to the lordship of Gordon of Badenoch and earldom of Enzie (although they had been created at the same time as the marquessate) while his claim to the ancient earldom of Huntly was also overlooked. Lord Huntly, who also held the subsidiary title of Lord Gordon of Strahaven and Glenlivet, had earlier been a Scottish Representative Peer from 1796 to 1807. In 1815 he had been created Baron Meldrum, of Morven in the County of Aberdeen, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.
He was succeeded by his son, the tenth Marquess. He represented East Grinstead and Huntingdonshire in the House of Commons and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire. His eldest son, the eleventh Marquess, was a Liberal politician and served briefly under William Ewart Gladstone as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms in 1881. He was succeeded by his great-nephew, the twelfth Marquess. He was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel (Granville Cecil) Douglas Gordon (1883–1930), son of Granville Armyn Gordon (1856–1907), sixth son of the tenth Marquess. the titles are held by the twelfth Marquess&#x27; son, Granville Charles Gomer Gordon, 13th Marquess of Huntly, 9th Earl of Aboyne, 9th Lord Gordon of Strathavon and Glenlivet and 5th Baron Meldrum, who succeeded in 1987. He is Chief of Clan Gordon.

Before the passing of the Peerage Act 1963, which granted all Scottish peers a seat in the House of Lords, the Marquesses of Huntly sat in the House of Lords in virtue of their junior title of Baron Meldrum, which was in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==Other family members==
Several other members of the Gordon family have also gained distinction. Lord John Gordon, younger son of the first Marquess, was created Viscount Melgum in 1627. However, he perished in the Fire of Frendraught and thus, the title became extinct in 1630. Lord Adam Gordon (died 1801), younger son of the second Duke, was a general in the Army. Lord William Gordon (1744–1823), second son of the third Duke, was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy. Lord George Gordon, third and youngest son of the third Duke, sat as Member of Parliament for Ludgershall but is best remembered as the instigator of the Gordon Riots. Charles Gordon (1798–1878), illegitimate son of the fifth Duke, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. Lord John Frederick Gordon (1799–1878), third son of the ninth Marquess, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. He married Lady Augusta Fitzclarence, daughter of King William IV by his mistress Dorothy Jordan. Laurence George Frank Gordon (1864–1943), grandson of Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Francis Arthur Gordon (1808–1857), sixth son of the ninth Marquess, was a brigadier-general in the Army. Lord Douglas Gordon, fourth son of the tenth Marquess, was Member of Parliament for Huntingdon.

The family seat is Aboyne Castle. The family also previously owned Huntly Castle, Huntly, Aberdeenshire.

<text>Hillcrest High School is an Ottawa-Carleton District School Board high school in the Elmvale Acres neighbourhood of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The school was opened in 1961. Its sports teams are nicknamed &quot;The Hawks&quot;. Its exclusive catchment area covers the neighbourhoods of Riverview, Faircrest Heights, Playfair Park, Elmvale Acres, Urbandale, Hawthorne Meadows, Sheffield Glen, Hunt Club Park and part of Greenboro.

Hillcrest High School is an ethnically diverse school. The surrounding area includes significant Black, Arab, Indian, and Somali communities, among others. Hillcrest also offers a full-immersion French program.

==Sports==

Hillcrest has a long history of success in sports. The school has won numerous boys&#x27; rugby, basketball and hockey championships. The senior boys&#x27; rugby team was considered the top in the city, years 2006–08. The junior basketball team was considered the top in the city in the year 2008–09. Hillcrest&#x27;s varsity girls&#x27; hockey team claimed the tier 2 championship, two years in a row 08-09 and 09–10. Also notable is their track team&#x27;s long history of success at the city and provincial levels. In the past, players on the Ottawa 67&#x27;s attended Hillcrest during the season (prior to changes to the cross-boundary transfer process).

==Allegations==
In June 2022, a petition was circulated to remove the principal over allegations of racism. The Principal and other teaching staff were alleged to have singled-out Black and Arab students for discipline, including monitoring washrooms for vaping, subjecting them to searches, and following procedures set by the board for mandatory police contact. The Ottawa-Carleton District School Board have stated that an investigation into these allegations is ongoing.

<doc id="410663" wikidata="Q152910" url="?curid=410663" title="Whip">
<text>A whip is a blunt weapon or implement used in a striking motion to create sound or pain. Whips can be used for flagellation against humans or animals to exert control through pain compliance or fear of pain, or be used as an audible cue through the distinct whipcrack effect. The portion used for striking is generally either a firm rod designed for direct contact, or a flexible line requiring a specialized swing. The former is easier and more precise, the latter offers longer reach and greater force. Some varieties, such as a hunting whip or lunge whip, have an extended stock section in addition to the line.

Whips such as the &quot;cat o&#x27; nine tails&quot; and knout are specifically developed for corporal punishment or torture on human targets. Certain religious practices and BDSM activities involve the self-use of whips or the use of whips between consenting partners. Misuse on animals may be considered animal cruelty, and misuse on humans may be viewed as assault.

==Use==
Whips are generally used on animals to provide directional guidance or to encourage movement. Some whips are designed to control animals by imparting discomfort by tapping or pain by a full-force strike that produces pain compliance. Some whips provide guidance by the use of sound, such as cracking of a bullwhip. Other uses of whips are to provide a visual directional cue by extending the reach and visibility of the human arm.

In modern times, the pain stimulus is still used in some animal training, and is permitted in many fields, including most equestrianism disciplines, some of which mandate carrying a whip. The whip can be a vital tool to back up riding aids when applied correctly, particularly when initial commands are ignored. However, many competition governing bodies limit the use of whips, and severe penalties may be in place for over-use of the whip, including disqualification and fines. Improper overuse of whips may be considered animal cruelty in some jurisdictions.

Whip use by sound never or rarely strikes the animal; instead, a long, flexible whip is cracked to produce a very sharp, loud sound. This usage also functions as a form of operant conditioning: most animals will flinch away from the sound instinctively, making it effective for driving sled dogs, livestock and teams of harnessed animals like oxen and mules. The sound is loud enough to affect multiple animals at once, making whip-cracking more efficient under some circumstances. This technique can be used as part of an escalation response, with sound being used first prior to a pain stimulus being applied, again as part of operant conditioning.

Whips used without painful stimulus, as an extension of the human hand or arm, are a visual command, or to tap an animal, or to exert pressure. Such use may be related to operant conditioning where the subject is conditioned to associate the whip with irritation, discomfort or pain, but in other cases, a whip can be used as a simple tool to provide a cue connected to positive reinforcement for compliant behavior. In the light of modern attitudes towards the potential for cruelty in whips, other names have gained currency among practitioners such as whips called a &quot;wand&quot; or a &quot;stick,&quot; calling the lash a &quot;string&quot; or a &quot;popper&quot;.

===Cracking===

The loud sound of a whip-crack is produced by a ripple in the material of whip travelling towards the tip, rapidly escalating in speed until it breaches the speed of sound, more than 30 times the speed of the initial movement in the handle. The crack is thus a small sonic boom. Whips were the first man-made objects to break the sound barrier.

Most stick type whips cannot make a crack by themselves, unless they either have a very long lash, such as a longe whip, or are very flexible with a moderately long lash, like certain styles of buggy whip. But any design can be banged against another object, such as leather boot, to make a loud noise. Short, stiff crops often have a wide leather &quot;popper&quot; at the end which makes a particularly loud noise when slapped against an animal, boot, or other object.

==Types==
===Stockwhip===


Stockwhips (or &quot;stock whips&quot;), including bullwhips and the Australian stockwhip, are a type of single-tailed leather whip with a very long lash but a short handle. Stockwhips are primarily used to make a loud cracking sound via special techniques that break the sound barrier, to move livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, etc.) away from the sound. It is generally not used to actually strike an animal, as it would inflict excessive pain and is difficult to apply with precision.

====Australian====
The Australian stockwhip is often said to have originated in the English hunting whip, but it has since become a distinct type of whip. Today, it is used primarily by stockmen. Unlike the short, embedded handle of a bullwhip, the stockwhip handle is not fitted inside the lash and is usually longer. A stockwhip&#x27;s handle is connected to the thong by a joint typically made of a few strands of thick leather (which is called a keeper). This allows the whip to hang across a stockman&#x27;s arm when not being used. The handles are normally longer than those of a bullwhip, being between . The thong can be from long. Stockwhips are also almost exclusively made from tanned kangaroo hide.

The Australian stockwhip was shown internationally when lone rider Steve Jefferys reared his Australian Stock Horse and cracked the stockwhip to commence the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games Opening Ceremony.

====Bullwhip====
A bullwhip consists of a handle between in length, and a lash composed of a braided thong between long. Some whips have an exposed wooden grip, others have an intricately braided leather covered handle. Unlike the Australian stock whip, the thong connects in line with the handle (rather than with a joint), or even engulfs the handle entirely. At the end of the lash is the &quot;fall&quot; and cracker or popper. The fall is a single piece of leather between in length. During trick shots or target work, the fall is usually the portion of the whip used to cut, strike, or wrap around the target. The cracker is the portion of the whip that makes the loud &quot;sonic boom&quot; sound, but a whip without a cracker will still make a sonic boom, simply not as loud.

====Other====

There are other variations and lengths of stock whips. The yard whip is a type of smaller stockwhip. The yard whip is used on ground in cattle yards and other small areas where speed and precision is needed. The yard whip is also used by younger children that are not strong enough to handle a large stock whip.

The cattle drafter (or drafting whip) is a cane or fibreglass rod with a handgrip, knob and wrist strap. The cane length is about and the flapper length is about long. These whips are used in cattle yards and also when moving pigs.

The bullock-whip was used by an Australian bullock team driver (bullocky). The thong was long, or more, and often made of greenhide. A long handle was cut from spotted gum or another native tree and was frequently taller than the bullock driver&#x27;s shoulder. The bullocky walked beside the team and kept the bullocks moving with taps from the long handle as well as using the thong as needed.

The Rose whip is another variation of the stockwhip that was pioneered in Canada in the early 19th century, though it largely fell out of use by the 1880s. The Rose whips were effective in animal yards and other small areas. It was pioneered by an American farmer, Jack Liao.

The Raman whip is a similar variation of the stockwhip which closely relates to the Rose whip. This variation was pioneered in the small Ontario city of Hamilton in the early 20th century, though it largely fell out of use by the 1920s. Raman whips were effective on horse farms, horse derbies, and in other rural areas. It was pioneered by the South African inventor, Delaware Kumar.

===Cow whip===
The Florida cow whip used by Floridian cowboys is a two-piece unit like the stockwhip and is connected to the handle by threading two strands of the thong through a hollow part of a wooden handle before being tied off. The cowwhip is heavier than the Australian stockwhip. Early cowwhips were made mostly of cowhide or buckskin.

Modern cow whips are made of flat nylon parachute cord, which, unlike those made from leather, are still effective when wet. Most cowwhips have handles that average , and thongs that average . A good cowwhip can produce a loud crack by a simple push of the handle. This can make it more convenient to use than a bullwhip in a thick vegetated environment with less swinging room. The Tampa Bay Whip Enthusiasts give demonstrations of the Florida Cracker Cowboy in costume at the annual Heritage Village Civil War Days festival, located in Largo, Florida every year in May.

===Signalwhip===

Signal whips (or signalwhips) are a type of single-tailed whip, originally designed to control dog teams. A signal whip usually measures between in length. Signal whips and snake whips are similar. What distinguishes a signal whip from a snake whip is the absence of a &quot;fall&quot;. A fall is a piece of leather attached to the end of the body of the whip. In a snake whip, the &quot;cracker&quot; attaches to the fall. In a signal whip, the cracker attaches directly to the body of the whip.

===Snakewhip===
Snake whips (or snakewhips) are a type of single-tailed whip. The name snake whip is derived from the fact that this type of whip has no handle inside and so can be curled up into a small circle which resembles a coiled snake. They were once commonly carried in the saddlebag by cowboys of the old west. A full sized snake whip is usually at least in length (excluding the fall and cracker at the tip of the whip) and around one inch in diameter at the butt of the whip.

A pocket snake whip can be curled up small enough to fit into a large pocket, and ranges in size from in length. The pocket snake whip is primarily a whip for occasional use, such as in loading cattle. Both of these types of snake whips are made with a leather shot bag running approximately three quarters of the length of the whip.

Blacksnakes are the traditional whips used in Montana and Wyoming. The blacksnake has a heavy shot load extending from the butt well down the thong, and the whip is flexible right to the butt. They range in size from in length. Some types concentrate a load in the butt (often a lead ball or steel ball-bearing) to facilitate its use as improvised blackjack.

===Equestrian===
Horse whips or riding whips are artificial aids used by equestrians while riding, driving, or handling horses from the ground. There are many different kinds, but all feature a handle, a long, semi-flexible shaft, and either a popper or lash at the end, depending on use. Riding whips rarely exceed 48&quot; from handle to popper, horse whips used for ground training and carriage driving are sometimes longer.

The term &quot;whip&quot; is the generic word for riding whips, the term &quot;crop&quot; is more specific, referring to a short, stiff whip used primarily in English riding disciplines such as show jumping or hunt seat. Some of the more common types of horse whips include:

*Dressage whips are up to long, including lash or popper, and are used to refine the aids of the rider, not to hurt the horse. They generally ask for more impulsion, and are long enough that they can reach behind the rider&#x27;s leg to tap the horse while the rider still holds the reins with both hands. The shaft is slightly flexible and tapers to a fine point at the tip. A similar, but slightly longer whip is used in saddle seat style English riding.

*Longe whips have a shaft about long and a lash of equal or greater length. They are used to direct the horse as it is &#x27;moved on a circle around the person standing in the centre, a process known as &quot;longeing&quot; (&quot;pronounced&quot; ) The whip is used to guide and signal direction and pace, and is not used with force against the horse. Taking the place of the rider&#x27;s leg aids, the positioning of the longe whip in relation to the horse gives the horse signals. Occasionally, due to the long lash, it may be cracked to enforce a command.
*Driving whips for carts, carriages, and coaches have a stock about the same length as a longe whips. The lash should be long enough to reach the shoulder of the forward-most horse from the driver&#x27;s seat.
*A crop or &quot;bat&quot; has a fairly stiff stock, and is only in length, with a &quot;popper&quot; - a looped flap of leather - at the end. Because it is too short to reach behind the riders leg while still holding the reins, it is most often used by taking the reins in one hand and hitting the horse behind the rider&#x27;s leg, using the crop, held in the other hand. Less often, it may be used to tap the horse on the shoulder as a simple reminder to the animal that the rider is carrying it. It is to back up the leg aids, when the horse is not moving forward, or occasionally as a disciplinary measure (such as when a horse refuses or runs out on a jump). Crops or bats are most commonly seen in sports such as show jumping, hunt seat style English riding, horse racing, and in rodeo speed sports such as barrel racing.
*A hunting whip is not precisely a horse whip, though it is carried by a mounted rider. It has a stock about the same length as a crop, except its &quot;stock&quot; is stiff, not flexible. On one end of the stock it has a lash that is ~1 m in length, on the other end it has a hook, which is used to help the rider open and close gates while out fox hunting. The hunting whip is &quot;not&quot; intended to be used on the horse, but rather the lash is there to remind the hounds to stay away from the horse&#x27;s hooves, and it can also be used as a communication device to the hounds.
*A quirt is a short, flexible piece of thickly braided leather with two wide pieces of leather at the end, which makes a loud crack when it strikes an animal or object. They inflict more noise than pain. Quirts are occasionally carried on horses used in western riding disciplines, but because the action of a quirt is slow, they are not used to correct or guide the horse, but are more apt to be used by a rider to reach out and strike at animals, such as cattle that are being herded from horseback.

*A show cane is a short, stiff cane that may be plain, leather covered, or covered with braided leather. Traditional canes are made from a stick of holly, cherry or birch wood, which is dressed and polished. They are rarely used now except in formal show hacking events.

Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s short story &quot;Garm - a Hostage&quot; mentions a long whip used by a horseback rider in India to defend an accompanying pet dog from risk of attack by native pariah dogs. This probably was a hunting whip.

In Victorian literature cads and bounders are depicted as being horsewhipped or threatened with horsewhipping for seduction of young women or breach of promise (to marry), usually by her brothers or father. Examples are found in the works of Benjamin Disraeli and Anthony Trollope who includes such a scene in Doctor Thorne. It is also mentioned, though not depicted, in comic novels by Evelyn Waugh and P.G. Wodehouse. As late as the 1970s the historian Desmond Seward was reported by the Daily Telegraph to have been threatened with horsewhipping for besmirching the reputation of Richard III in a biography.

===Cat o&#x27; nine tails===

The cat o&#x27; nine tails is a type of multi-tailed whip that originated as an implement for severe physical punishment, notably in the Royal Navy and Army of the United Kingdom, and also as a judicial punishment in Britain and some other countries. The cat is made up of nine knotted thongs of cotton cord, about long, designed to lacerate the skin and cause intense pain. It traditionally has nine thongs as a result of the manner in which rope is plaited. Thinner rope is made from three strands of yarn plaited together, and thicker rope from three strands of thinner rope plaited together. To make a cat o&#x27; nine tails, a rope is unravelled into three small ropes, each of which is unravelled again.

===Weapons===
The Bian (), also known as Chinese whip or hard whip, is a type of tubular-shaped club or rod weapon designed to inflict blunt damage with a whipping motion. A typical hard whip is made with metal and has a length of around 90 centimetres. Bamboo node-like protrusions are attached to the weapon body at regular intervals to reduce the contact surface and enhance the striking effect. The whip is stiff and does not bend. It weighs 7 or 8 kilograms. The weapon is used mainly on horseback with one hand, sometimes with two whips in both hands.

The chain whip, also known as the soft whip, is a weapon used in some Chinese martial arts, particularly traditional Chinese disciplines, in addition to modern and traditional wushu. It consists of several metal rods, which are joined end-to-end by rings to form a flexible chain. Generally, the whip has a handle at one end and a metal dart, used for slashing or piercing an opponent, at the other. A cloth flag is often attached at or near the dart end of the whip and a second flag may cover the whip&#x27;s handle.

According to the book &quot;The Chain Whip&quot;, a whip in Chinese historical text may refer to either the soft whip or the hard whip due to an ambiguity in the Chinese language. &quot;Both the hard whip and the soft whip can both be referred to simply as &quot;whip&quot; (鞭) in Chinese.&quot;

===Qilinbian===

Qilinbian (麒麟鞭, literally meaning &quot;unicorn whip&quot;) is a metal whip invented in China in the late 1900s. The 15 cm handle is made from a steel chain wrapped with leather. The lash is made of steel rods decreasing in size linked by progressively smaller steel rings. Lash varies between 150 cm and 180 cm and is attached to a fall and a cracker. Total weight is 1–2 kg. It is used for physical exercise and in performances.

==Animal morphology==
Some organisms exhibit whip-like appendages in their physiology:
Many unicellular organisms and spermatozoa have one or two whip-like flagella, which are used for propulsion. &quot;Flagellum&quot; is Latin for &quot;whip&quot;.

The tails of some large lizards (e.g. iguanas and monitor lizards) are used and optimized for whipping, and larger lizards can seriously injure a human with a well-placed strike. The biological names of some lizards reference this with the terms &quot;Mastigo-&quot; or &quot;-mastix&quot;, which derive from the Greek term for &quot;whip&quot;.

The whip snakes are so-called from their physical resemblance, and were associated with myths that they could whip with their body in self-defense, since proven false.

Uropygi arachnids are also known as &quot;whip scorpions&quot; due to the shape of their tails.

It has been proposed that some sauropod dinosaurs could crack the ends of their tails like coach whips as a sound signal, as well as a form of defense against any attackers. Newer, more sophisticated models, however, suggest that while the tails of some Diplodocid Dinosaurs could be used as whips, they likely would not have been able to break the sound barrier.

==In popular culture==
The whip is widely—if only situationally—portrayed across many avenues of popular culture. Whips have appeared in many cartoons, television shows, video games (including a central role in the &quot;Castlevania&quot; franchise), and numerous feature films, ranging from the original &quot;Zorro&quot; (1919) to &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) and &quot;Catwoman&quot; (2004).

The popular investigative-entertainment program &quot;MythBusters&quot; tested the various capabilities of whips shown in the film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; during &quot;The Busters of the Lost Myths&quot; episode. With exact trained usage, the show demonstrated that it is possible to disarm a pistol-wielding opponent with a long whip strike. The episode also demonstrates that a wood log, with sufficient friction, could be used as an overhang to grapple with a whip, swing across a chasm and neatly disengage. Using a high-speed camera they were also able to verify that the tip of a whip can break the speed of sound.

In the &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; series of stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Holmes occasionally carries a &quot;loaded&quot; hunting crop as his favorite weapon. (For example, see &quot;The Adventure of the Six Napoleons&quot;.) Such crops were sold at one time. Loading refers to the practice of filling the shaft and head with heavy metal (e.g., steel, lead) to provide some heft.

<text>Southern Europe is also known as Mediterranean Europe, as its geography is marked by the Mediterranean Sea. Definitions of southern Europe include some or all of these countries and regions: Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Gibraltar, Greece, Italy, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Portugal, San Marino, Serbia, Slovenia, southern France, Spain, Turkey (East Thrace), and Vatican City.

Southern Europe is focused on the three peninsulas located in the extreme south of the European continent. These are the Iberian Peninsula, the Italian Peninsula, and the Balkan Peninsula. These three peninsulas are separated from the rest of Europe by towering mountain ranges, respectively by the Pyrenees, the Alps and the Balkan Mountains. The location of these peninsulas in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, as well as their mountainous reliefs, provide them with very different types of climates (mainly subtropical Mediterranean) from the rest of the continent. So, the Sirocco hot wind that originates in the heart of the Sahara blows over Italy, going up to the interior of the Alpine arc (Po Valley). The Alps prevent the Sirocco from spreading to the rest of Europe. And, conversely, the Alps and the Pyrenees protect the Italian and Iberian Peninsulas from the rains and icy winds from the south of France such as the Mistral and the Tramontane. When the Mistral and the Tramontane are blowing, this provokes an &quot;upwelling&quot; phenomenon on the French coast. They push the surface waters out to sea and bring deeper, cooler waters up to the seaside. Consequently, the temperature of the waters of the French coasts are therefore very cool even in summer, and not representative of the rest of the Mediterranean.
This same kind of phenomenon takes place between the two slopes of the Balkan mountain range. These mountains have, moreover, been a serious handicap to population displacement, focusing southern Europe mainly on the Mediterranean world. The climate and cultures are therefore very specific.

Different methods can be used to define southern Europe, including its political, economic, historical, and cultural attributes. Southern Europe can also be defined by its natural features — its geography, climate, and flora. Politically, nine of the southern European countries form the EU Med Group. Southern Europe also loosely corresponds to the European part of the Mediterranean Basin.

== Geography ==

Geographically, southern Europe is the southern portion of the European continent. This definition is relative, although largely based on history, culture, climate, and flora, which is shared across the region. Southern Europe can be subdivided into three subregions:

* Iberian Peninsula and the surrounding islands (Southwest Europe)
** Balearic Islands (Spain)
** Iberian Peninsula
*** Andorra
*** French Cerdagne (France)
*** Gibraltar (United Kingdom)
*** Portugal (mainland)
*** Spain (mainland)
** Pyrénées-Orientales (France)

* Italian geographic region (South-central Europe)
** Alpes-Maritimes (France)
** Apennine Peninsula
*** Central Italy
*** San Marino
*** South Italy
*** Vatican City (Holy See)
** Corsica (France)
** Gorizia (Italy)
** Insular Italy
*** Sardinia
*** Sicily
** Istria (peninsula)
*** Ankaran (Slovenia)
*** Istria County (Croatia)
*** Izola (Slovenia)
*** Koper (Slovenia)
*** Muggia (Italy)
*** Piran (Slovenia)
*** San Dorligo della Valle (Italy)
** Malta
** Monaco
** Northern Italy
*** Northeast Italy
*** Northwest Italy
** Ticino (Switzerland)
** Trieste (Italy)

* Southeast Europe
** Balkan Peninsula
*** Albania
*** Bosnia and Herzegovina
*** Bulgaria
*** Croatia (southern mainland)
*** Turkey (East Thrace)
*** Greece (mainland)
*** Kosovo
*** Montenegro
*** North Macedonia
*** Romania (Northern Dobruja)
*** Serbia (Central Serbia)
*** Slovenia (south-western part)
** Croatia (northern mainland &amp; offshore islands)
** Cyprus
** Greece (islands)
** Moldova
** Romania (inland part)
** Serbia (Vojvodina)

The major islands in southern Europe generally include the Balearic Islands, Corsica, Crete, Cyprus, Sardinia, and Sicily, as well as the island country of Malta.

==Climate==
Southern Europe&#x27;s most emblematic climate is the Mediterranean climate, influenced by the large subtropical semi-permanent centre of high atmospheric pressure found, not in the Mediterranean itself, but in the Atlantic Ocean, the Azores High. The Mediterranean climate covers Portugal, Spain, Italy, the southern coast of France, coastal Croatia, coastal Slovenia, southern Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, and Greece, as well as the Mediterranean islands. Those areas of Mediterranean climate present similar vegetations and landscapes throughout, including dry hills, small plains, pine forests and olive trees.

Cooler climates can be found in certain parts of southern European countries, for example within the mountain ranges of Spain and Italy. Additionally, the north coast of Spain experiences a wetter Atlantic climate. In the highest regions of the Alps, which border southern Europe, even ice cap climate can be found.

Some parts of southern Europe have humid subtropical climates with warm and wet summers, unlike typical Mediterranean climates. This climate is mainly found in Italy and Croatia around the Adriatic Sea in cities such as Venice and Trieste, but also further north, near the Alpine foothills, in cities such as Como and Lugano.

== Flora ==
Southern Europe&#x27;s flora is mainly characterized by Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub, but also temperate broadleaf and mixed forests. The Mediterranean and Submediterranean climate regions in Europe are found in much of southern Europe, mainly Portugal, Spain, Italy, Malta, Albania, Greece, Cyprus and all the mediterranean islands, but also in southeast France, the Balkan Mediterranean coast and part of Macedonia.

In the Mediterranean coastal areas, olive groves, maquis shrubland, and steppes are very common. At higher elevations, or latitudes, they are replaced by chestnut and (often coppiced) mixed forests.

==History==
===Early history===

The Phoenicians originally expanded from Canaan ports, dominating trade in the Mediterranean by the 8th century BC. Carthage was founded in 814 BC, and the Carthaginians by 700 BC had firmly established strongholds in Sicily and Sardinia (both regions in present day Italy), which created conflicts of interest with Etruria. Its colonies later reached the Western Mediterranean, such as Cádiz in Spain and most notably Carthage in North Africa, and even the Atlantic Ocean. The civilisation spread across the Mediterranean between 1500 BC and 300 BC.

The period known as classical antiquity began with the rise of the city-states of Ancient Greece. Greek influence reached its zenith under the expansive empire of Alexander the Great, spreading throughout Asia. The Roman Empire came to dominate the entire Mediterranean Basin in a vast empire based on Roman law and Roman legions. It promoted trade, tolerance, and Greek culture. By 300 AD the Roman Empire was divided into the Western Roman Empire based in Rome, and the Eastern Roman Empire based in Constantinople. The attacks of the Goths led to the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, a date which traditionally marks the end of the classical period and the start of the Middle Ages. During the Middle Ages, the Eastern Roman Empire survived, though modern historians refer to this state as the Byzantine Empire. In Western Europe, Germanic peoples moved into positions of power in the remnants of the former Western Roman Empire and established kingdoms and empires of their own.

The period known as the Crusades, a series of religiously motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the Levant back into Christian rule, began. Several Crusader states were founded in the eastern Mediterranean. These were all short-lived. The Crusaders would have a profound impact on many parts of Europe. Their sack of Constantinople in 1204 brought an abrupt end to the Byzantine Empire. Though it would later be re-established, it would never recover its former glory. The Crusaders would establish trade routes that would develop into the Silk Road and open the way for the merchant republics of Genoa and Venice to become major economic powers. The Reconquista, a related movement, worked to reconquer Iberia for Christendom. The late Middle Ages represented a period of upheaval in Europe. The epidemic known as the Black Death and an associated famine caused demographic catastrophe in Europe as the population plummeted. Dynastic struggles and wars of conquest kept many of the states of Europe at war for much of the period. In the Balkans, the Ottoman Empire, a Turkish state originating in Anatolia, encroached steadily on former Byzantine lands, culminating in the fall of Constantinople in 1453.

===Post-Middle Ages===
Beginning roughly in the 12th century in Florence, and later spreading through Europe with the development of the printing press, a Renaissance of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology, with the Arabic texts and thought bringing about rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman knowledge. The Catholic reconquest of Portugal and Spain led to a series of oceanic explorations resulting in the Age of Discovery that established direct links with Africa, the Americas, and Asia. During this period, Iberian forces engaged in a worldwide struggle with Islamic societies; the battlefronts in this Ibero-Islamic World War stretched from the Mediterranean into the Indian Ocean, finally involving the islands of Southeast Asia (see also: Indo-Mediterranean). Eventually this ecumenical conflict ended when new players—England, Holland and France—replaced Spain and Portugal as the main agents of European imperialism in the mid-17th century.

European overseas expansion led to the rise of colonial empires, producing the Columbian Exchange. The combination of resource inflows from the New World and the Industrial Revolution of Great Britain, allowed a new economy based on manufacturing instead of subsistence agriculture. The period between 1815 and 1871 saw a large number of revolutionary attempts and independence wars. Balkan nations began to regain independence from the Ottoman Empire. Italy unified into a nation state. The capture of Rome in 1870 ended the Papal temporal power.

===20th and 21st century===
The outbreak of World War I in 1914 was precipitated by the rise of nationalism in Southeastern Europe as the Great Powers took up sides. The Allies defeated the Central Powers in 1918. During the Paris Peace Conference the Big Four imposed their terms in a series of treaties, especially the Treaty of Versailles. The Nazi regime under Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, and along with Mussolini&#x27;s Italy sought to gain control of the continent by the Second World War.
Following the Allied victory in the Second World War, Europe was divided by the Iron Curtain. The countries in Eastern and Southeastern Europe were dominated by the Soviet Union and became communist states. The major non-communist southern European countries joined a US-led military alliance (NATO) and formed the European Economic Community amongst themselves. The countries in the Soviet sphere of influence joined the military alliance known as the Warsaw Pact and the economic bloc called Comecon. Yugoslavia was neutral. The common attribute of the eastern countries is that all of them have experiences with socialism, but nevertheless, the beginning of the 1990s was just roughly the same. For some of them becoming independent was the major challenge, while others needed to face with poverty and deep dictatorship also Economically, parallel with the political changes, and the democratic transition, – as a rule of law states – the previous command economies were transformed via the legislation into market economies, and set up or renewed the major macroeconomic factors: budgetary rules, national audit, national currency, central bank. Generally, they shortly encountered the following problems: high inflation, high unemployment, low economic growth and high government debt. By 2000 these economies were stabilized, and sooner or later between 2004 and 2013 some of them joined the European Union, and Slovenia introduced the euro.

Italy became a major industrialized country again, due to its post-war economic miracle. The European Union (EU) involved the division of powers, with tax, health, and education handled by the nation states, while the EU had charge of market rules, competition, legal standards and environmentalism. The Soviet economic and political system collapsed, leading to the end of communism in the satellite countries in 1989, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself in 1991. European Union expanded to subsequently include many of the formerly communist European countries – Romania and Bulgaria (2007) and Croatia (2013).

The Gotthard, a major and direct transport axis between Northern and southern Europe, was completed in 2016 with the Gotthard Base Tunnel. The Gotthard inscribes itself in a long history of transit across the Alps, which saw them progressively changing from an obstacle to a corridor between the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.

== Demographics ==
=== Languages ===
==== Romance languages ====
The most widely spoken family of languages in southern Europe are the Romance languages, the heirs of Latin, which have spread from the Italian peninsula, and are emblematic of Southwestern Europe &quot;(See the Latin Arch.)&quot;. By far the most common Romance languages in southern Europe are Italian (spoken by over 50 million people in Italy, southern Switzerland, Malta, San Marino, and Vatican City) and Spanish, which is spoken by over 40 million people in Spain, Andorra and Gibraltar. Other common Romance languages include Portuguese (spoken in Portugal and Andorra), French (spoken in France, Monaco, and the Aosta Valley in Italy), Catalan (spoken in eastern Spain, Andorra, Southwestern France, and the Sardinian town of Alghero in Italy), Galician (spoken in northwestern Spain), Mirandese (spoken in northeast Portugal), and Occitan, which is spoken in the Val d&#x27;Aran in Catalonia, in the Occitan Valleys in Italy and in southern France.

==== Slavic languages ====

Slavic Languages are spoken in several countries on the Balkans. Bulgarian language (Български език) is spoken in Bulgaria (България). Bosnian-Serbian-Croatian is spoken in Kosovo, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Italy (in Molise). Slovenian is spoken in Slovenia, Italy (in Friuli-Venezia Giulia) and Croatia (in Istria) and Macedonian is spoken in North Macedonia.

==== Other languages ====
The Hellenic languages or Greek language are widely spoken in Greece and Cyprus. Additionally, other varieties of Greek are spoken in small communities in parts of other European countries.

English is used as a second language in parts of southern Europe. As a primary language, however, English has only a small presence in southern Europe, only in Gibraltar (alongside Spanish) and Malta (secondary to Maltese). English is also widely spoken in Cyprus.

There are other language groupings in southern Europe. Albanian is spoken in Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Greece, Serbia, Croatia and Italy (particularly by the Arbëreshë people in southern Italy). Maltese is a Semitic language that is the official language of Malta, descended from Siculo-Arabic, but written in the Latin script with heavy Latin and Italian influences. The Basque language is spoken in the Basque Country, a region in northern Spain and southwestern France. Turkish is a Turkic language that is spoken in Turkey, Cyprus, Kosovo, Greece, North Macedonia and Bosnia, and German is spoken in Italy, particularly in South Tyrol.

=== Religion ===
The predominant religion in southern Europe is Christianity. Christianity spread throughout southern Europe during the Roman Empire, and Christianity was adopted as the official religion of the Roman Empire in the year 380 AD. 
Due to the historical break of the Church into the western half based in Rome and the eastern half based in Constantinople, different denominations of Christianity are prominent in different parts of Europe.
Christians in the western half of southern Europe — e.g., Portugal, Spain, Italy — are generally Roman Catholic. Christians in the eastern half of southern Europe — e.g., Greece, Serbia and North Macedonia — are generally Eastern Orthodox. Islam is widely practiced in Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo and Turkey and Northern Cyprus. Muslims are a significant minority in several countries of southern Europe- e.g., Greece, Italy, Spain. Judaism was practiced widely throughout the European continent within the Roman Empire from the 2nd century.

<text>In international relations, public diplomacy broadly speaking, is any of the various government-sponsored efforts aimed at communicating directly with foreign publics to establish a dialogue designed to inform and influence with the aim of building support for the state&#x27;s strategic objectives. These also include propaganda. As the international order has changed over the twentieth century, so has the practice of public diplomacy. Its practitioners use a variety of instruments and methods ranging from personal contact and media interviews to the internet and educational exchanges.

== Background and definitions ==

Over time, the concept and definition of public diplomacy has evolved, as demonstrated by the following statements from various practitioners:

The most important roles public diplomacy will have to play for the United States in the current international environment will be less grand-strategic and more operational than during the Cold War. Support of national policy in military contingencies is one such role, and probably the most important.
– Carnes Lord (former deputy director of USIA), professor of statecraft and civilization, October 1998

Public diplomacy – effectively communicating with publics around the globe – to understand, value and even emulate America&#x27;s vision and ideas; historically one of America&#x27;s most effective weapons of outreach, persuasion and policy.
– Jill A. Schuker (former senior director for public affairs at the National Security Council), July 2004

Public diplomacy&#x27;s 21st century trend is dominated by fractal globalization, preemptive military invasion, information and communication technologies that shrink time and distance, and the rise of global non-state actors (terror networks, bloggers) that challenge state-driven policy and discourse on the subject.– Nancy Snow, &quot;Routledge Handbook of Public Diplomacy&quot;, 
Public diplomacy may be defined, simply, as the conduct of international relations by governments through public communications media and through dealings with a wide range of nongovernmental entities (political parties, corporations, trade associations, labor unions, educational institutions, religious organizations, ethnic groups, and so on including influential individuals) for the purpose of influencing the politics and actions of other governments.– Alan K. Henrikson, Professor of Diplomatic History, April 2005.

Public diplomacy that traditionally represents actions of governments to influence overseas publics within the foreign policy process has expanded today—by accident and design—beyond the realm of governments to include the media, multinational corporations, NGO&#x27;s and faith-based organizations as active participants in the field.– Crocker Snow Jr., Acting Director Edward R. Murrow Center, May 2005.Public diplomacy refers to government-sponsored programs intended to inform or influence public opinion in other countries; its chief instruments are publications, motion pictures, cultural exchanges, radio and television. – U.S. Department of State, &quot;Dictionary of International Relations Terms&quot;, 1987, p. 85The United States Information Agency (USIA), which was the main government agency in charge of public diplomacy until it merged with the Department of State in 1999, described it as &quot;seek[ing] to promote the national interest and the national security of the United States through understanding, informing, and influencing foreign publics and broadening dialogue between American citizens and institutions and their counterparts abroad.&quot; For the Planning Group for Integration of USIA into the Department of State (June 20, 1997), public diplomacy meant &quot;seek[ing] to promote the national interest of the United States through understanding, informing and influencing foreign audiences.&quot; According to Hans N. Tuch, author of &quot;Communicating With the World&quot; (St. Martin&#x27;s Press, NY, 1990), public diplomacy is &quot;official government efforts to shape the communications environment overseas in which American foreign policy is played out, in order to reduce the degree to which misperceptions and misunderstandings complicate relations between the U.S. and other nations.&quot;

Standard diplomacy might be described as the ways in which government leaders communicate with each other at the highest levels, the elite diplomacy we are all familiar with. Public diplomacy, by contrast focuses on the ways in which a country (or multilateral organization such as the United Nations) communicates with citizens in other societies. A country may be acting deliberately or inadvertently, and through both official and private individuals and institutions. Effective public diplomacy starts from the premise that dialogue, rather than a sales pitch, is often central to achieving the goals of foreign policy: public diplomacy must be seen as a two-way street. Furthermore, public diplomacy activities often present many differing views as represented by private American individuals and organizations in addition to official U.S. government views.

Traditional diplomacy actively engages one government with another government. In traditional diplomacy, U.S. Embassy officials represent the U.S. government in a host country primarily by maintaining relations and conducting official business with the officials of the host government whereas public diplomacy primarily engages many diverse non-government elements of a society.

Film, television, music, sports, video games and other social/cultural activities are seen by public diplomacy advocates as enormously important avenues for otherwise diverse citizens to understand each other and integral to the international cultural understanding, which they state is a key goal of modern public diplomacy strategy. It involves not only shaping the message(s) that a country wishes to present abroad, but also analyzing and understanding the ways that the message is interpreted by diverse societies and developing the tools of listening and conversation as well as the tools of persuasion.

One of the most successful initiatives which embodies the principles of effective public diplomacy is the creation by international treaty in the 1950s of the European Coal and Steel Community which later became the European Union. Its original purpose after World War II was to tie the economies of Europe together so much that war would be impossible. Supporters of European integration see it as having achieved both this goal and the extra benefit of catalysing greater international understanding as European countries did more business together and the ties among member states&#x27; citizens increased. Opponents of European integration are leery of a loss of national sovereignty and greater centralization of power.

Public diplomacy has been an essential element of American foreign policy for decades. It was an important tool in influencing public opinion during the Cold War with the former Soviet Union. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the term has come back into vogue as the United States government works to improve their reputation abroad, particularly in the Middle East and among those in the Islamic world. Numerous panels, including those sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, have evaluated American efforts in public diplomacy since 9/11 and have written reports recommending that the United States take various actions to improve the effectiveness of their public diplomacy.

The United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy was established in the late 1940s to evaluate American public diplomacy effort. The commission is a seven-member bipartisan board whose members are nominated by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate. William Hybl is the current chair, and other members include former Ambassadors Lyndon Olson and Penne Percy Korth Peacock, as well as Jay Snyder, John E. Osborn and Lezlee Westine.

This traditional concept is expanded on with the idea of adopting what is called &quot;population-centric foreign affairs&quot; within which foreign populations assume a central component of foreign policy. Since people, not just states, are of global importance in a world where technology and migration increasingly face everyone, an entire new door of policy is opened.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===

Soon after its founding, the People&#x27;s Republic of China institutionalized its view of public diplomacy as &quot;people&#x27;s diplomacy&quot; (&quot;renmin waijiao&quot;). People&#x27;s diplomacy was expressed through the slogan, &quot;influence the policy through the people.&quot; Pursuant to its people&#x27;s diplomacy, China sent doctors, scientists, and athletes to developing countries in Asia to cultivate ties. This form of people&#x27;s diplomacy was often executed through the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s International Liaison Department.

People&#x27;s diplomacy with the capitalist countries sought to cultivate informal, non-state ties in the hope of developing &quot;foreign friends&quot; who would lobby their governments to improve relations with China. In the context of China-United States relations, one of the most prominent instances of people&#x27;s diplomacy was the ping-pong diplomacy which arose following a conversation between Chinese and American players at the 1971 World Championships in Nagoya, Japan. China&#x27;s approach to keeping these exchanges unofficial and conduct them through non-governmental agencies was generally well-received by U.S. civil society groups and academics.

Sister city initiatives are an increasingly widespread mechanism for Chinese public diplomacy. From the early 2000s until 2024, the number of China&#x27;s sister city relationships doubled. More than one-third of Chinese sister city relationships are with sister cities in the east Asia Pacific region.

The &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; has described Confucius Institutes as a form of public diplomacy.

==== International communication centers ====
=== Republic of China ===
During the 1970s, the Kuomintang during the tenure of Executive Yuan Premier Chiang Ching-kuo organized a people&#x27;s diplomacy campaign in the United States in an effort to mobilize American political sentiment in opposition to the PRC through mass demonstrations and petitions. Among these efforts, the KMT worked with the John Birch Society to launch a petition writing campaign through which Americans were urged to write their local government officials and ask them to &quot;Cut the Red China connection.&quot;

==Methods==
There are many methods and instruments that are used in public diplomacy.

International broadcasting remains a key element in public diplomacy in the 21st century, with traditionally weaker states having the opportunity to challenge the hegemony and monopoly of information provided by more powerful states.

Methods such as personal contact, broadcasters such as the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty exchange programs such as Fulbright and the International Visitor Leadership Program, American arts and performances in foreign countries, and the use of the Internet are all instruments used for practicing public diplomacy depending on the audience to be communicated with and the message to be conveyed.

==Impact==
According to a 2021 study, high-level visits by leaders increases public approval among foreign citizens.

<text>Mount Adams, known by some Native American tribes as Pahto or Klickitat, is an active stratovolcano in the Cascade Range. Although Adams has not erupted in more than 1,000 years, it is not considered extinct. It is the second-highest mountain in Washington, after Mount Rainier.

Adams, named for President John Adams, is a member of the Cascade Volcanic Arc, and is one of the arc&#x27;s largest volcanoes, located in a remote wilderness approximately east of Mount St. Helens. The Mount Adams Wilderness consists of the upper and western part of the volcano&#x27;s cone. The eastern side of the mountain is designated as part of the territory of the Yakama Nation.

Adams&#x27; asymmetrical and broad body rises above the Cascade crest. Its nearly flat summit was formed as a result of cone-building eruptions from separated vents. The Pacific Crest Trail traverses the western flank of the mountain.

==Geography==

===General===

Mount Adams stands east of Mount St. Helens and about south of Mount Rainier. It is north of the Columbia River and north of Mount Hood in Oregon. The nearest major cities are Yakima, to the northeast, and the Portland metropolitan area, to the southwest. Between half and two thirds of Adams is within the Mount Adams Wilderness of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The remaining area is within the Mount Adams Recreation Area of the Yakama Indian Reservation. While many of the volcanic peaks in Oregon are located on the Cascade Crest, Adams is the only active volcano in Washington to be so. It is farther east than all the rest of Washington&#x27;s volcanoes except Glacier Peak.

Adams is one of the long-lived volcanoes in the Cascade Range, with minor activity beginning 900,000 years ago and major cone building activity beginning 520,000 years ago. The whole mountain has been completely eroded by glaciers to an elevation of twice during its lifetime. The current cone was built during the most recent major eruptive period 40,000–10,000 years ago.

Standing at , Adams towers about over the surrounding countryside. It is the second-highest mountain in Washington and third-highest in the Cascade Range. Because of the way it developed, it is the largest stratovolcano in Washington and second-largest in the Cascades, behind only Mount Shasta. Its large size is reflected in its -diameter base, which has a prominent north–south trending axis.

Adams is the source of the headwaters for two major rivers, the Lewis River and White Salmon River. The many streams that emanate from the glaciers and from springs at its base flow into two more major river systems, the Cispus River and the Klickitat River. The streams on the north and west portions of Adams feed the Cispus River, which joins the Cowlitz River near Riffe Lake, and the Lewis River.

To the south, the White Salmon River has its source on the lower flanks of the west side of Adams and gains additional flows from streams along the southwest side of the mountain. Streams on the east side all flow to the Klickitat River. Streams on all sides, at some point in their courses, provide essential irrigation water for farming and ranching. The Klickitat and White Salmon rivers are nearly completely free flowing, with only small barriers to aid irrigation (White Salmon) and erosion control (Klickitat). The Cispus and Lewis rivers have been impounded with dams farther downstream for flood control and power generation purposes.

Mount Adams is the second-most isolated, in terms of access, stratovolcano in Washington; Glacier Peak is the most isolated. Only two major highways pass close to it. Highway 12 passes about to the north of Adams through the Cascades. Highway 141 comes within of Adams as it follows the White Salmon River valley up from the Columbia River to the small town of Trout Lake. From either highway, travelers have to use Forest Service roads to get closer to the mountain. The main access roads, FR 23, FR 82, FR 80, and FR 21, are paved for part of their length. Almost all other roads are gravel or dirt, with varying degrees of maintenance. Access to the Mount Adams Recreation Area is by way of FR 82, which becomes BIA 285 at the Yakama reservation boundary. BIA 285 is known to be extremely rough and often suitable only for trucks or high-clearance vehicles. Two small towns, Glenwood and Trout Lake, are located in valleys within of the summit, Glenwood on the southeast quarter and Trout Lake on the southwest quarter.

The mountain&#x27;s size and distance from major cities, and the tendency of some people to forget or ignore Mount Adams, has led some people to call this volcano &quot;The Forgotten Giant of Washington&quot;.

On a clear day from the summit, other visible volcanoes in the Cascade Range include: Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, and Glacier Peak to the north, as well as Mount St. Helens to the west, all in Washington; and Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, and the Three Sisters, all to the south in Oregon.

===Summit area===
Contrary to legend, the flatness of Adams&#x27; current summit area is not due to the loss of the volcano&#x27;s peak. Instead, it was formed as a result of cone-building eruptions from separated vents. A false summit, Pikers Peak, rises on the south side of the nearly half-mile (800 m) wide summit area. The true summit is about higher on the gently sloping north side. A small lava and scoria cone marks the highest point. Suksdorf Ridge is a long buttress descending from the false summit to an elevation of . This structure was built by repeated lava flows in the late Pleistocene. The Pinnacle forms the northwest false summit and was created by erosion from the Adams and White Salmon glaciers. On the east side, The Castle is a low prominence at the top of Battlement Ridge. The summit crater is filled with snow and is open on its west rim.

===Flank terrain features===
Prominent ridges descend from the mountain on all sides. On the north side, the aptly named North Cleaver comes down from a point below the summit ice cap heading almost due north. The Northwest Ridge and West Ridge descend from the Pinnacle, to the northwest and west, respectively. Stagman Ridge descends west-southwest from a point about halfway up the west side and turns more southwest at about . South of Stagman Ridge lies Crofton Ridge. Crofton gradually becomes very broad as it descends southwesterly from the tree line. MacDonald Ridge, on the south side, starts at about tree line below the lower end of Suksdorf Ridge and descends in a southerly direction.

Three prominent ridges descend from the east side of the mountain. The Ridge of Wonders is farthest south and ends at an area away from the mountain called The Island. Battlement Ridge is very rugged and descends from high on the mountain. The farthest ridge north on the east side, Victory Ridge, descends from a lower elevation on the mountain than Battlement Ridge beneath the precipitous Roosevelt Cliff. Lava Ridge, starting at about the same location as the North Cleaver, descends slightly east of north.

Several rock prominences exist on the lower flanks of Adams. The Spearhead is an abrupt rocky prominence near the bottom of Battlement Ridge. Burnt Rock, The Hump, and The Bumper are three smaller rocky prominences at or below the tree line on the west side.

===Glaciers===
In the early 21st century, glaciers covered a total of 2.5% of Adams&#x27; surface. During the last ice age about 90% of the mountain was glaciated. Mount Adams has 209 perennial snow and ice features and 12 officially named glaciers. The total ice-covered area makes up , while the area of named glaciers is . Most of the largest remaining glaciers (including the Adams, Klickitat, Lyman, and White Salmon) originate from Adams&#x27; summit ice cap.

On the northwest face of the mountain, Adams Glacier cascades down a steep channel in a series of icefalls before spreading out and terminating at around the elevation, where it becomes the source of the Lewis River and Adams Creek, a tributary of the Cispus River. Its eastern lobe ends at a small glacial tarn, Equestria Lake. In the Cascades, Adams Glacier is second in size only to Carbon Glacier on Mount Rainier.
The Pinnacle, White Salmon, and Avalanche glaciers on the west side of the mountain are less thick and voluminous, and are generally patchy in appearance. They all originate from glacial cirques below the actual summit. Although the White Salmon Glacier does not originate from the summit ice cap, it does begin very high on the mountain at about . In the early 20th century, a portion of it descended from the summit ice cap, but volume loss has separated it. Some of its glacial ice feeds the Avalanche Glacier below it to the southwest while the rest tumbles over some large cliffs to its diminutive lower section to the west. The White Salmon and Avalanche Glaciers feed the many streams of the Salt Creek and Cascade Creek drainages, which flow into the White Salmon River. The Pinnacle Glacier is the source of a fork of the Lewis River as well as Riley Creek, which is also a tributary of the Lewis River.

The south side of the mountain along Suksdorf Ridge is moderately glacier-free, with the only glaciers being the relatively small Gotchen Glacier and the Crescent Glacier. The south side, however, does have some perennial snowfields on its slopes. The Crescent Glacier is the source of Morrison Creek; and, although it does not feed it directly, the Gotchen Glacier is the source of Gotchen Creek. Both creeks drain to the White Salmon River.
The rugged east side has four glaciers, the Mazama Glacier, Klickitat Glacier, Rusk Glacier, and the Wilson Glacier. During the last ice age, they carved out two immense canyons: the Hellroaring Canyon and the Avalanche Valley. This created the Ridge of Wonders between the two. Of the four glaciers on the east side, the Mazama Glacier is the farthest south and begins between the Suksdorf Ridge and Ridge of Wonders at about . Near its terminus, it straddles the Ridge of Wonders and a small portion feeds into the Klickitat Glacier. The glacier gains more area from additional glacier ice that collects from drifting snow and avalanches below the Suksdorf Ridge as the ridge turns south. The Mazama Glacier terminates at about and is the source of Hellroaring Creek, which flows over several waterfalls before it joins Big Muddy Creek. Klickitat Glacier on the volcano&#x27;s eastern flank originates in a wide cirque and is fed by two smaller glaciers from the summit ice cap. It terminates around , where it becomes the source of Big Muddy Creek, a tributary of the Klickitat River. The Rusk Glacier does not start from the summit ice cap but starts at below the Roosevelt Cliff and is fed by avalanching snow and ice from the summit cap. It is enclosed on the south by Battlement Ridge and Victory Ridge on the north and terminates at about . It is the source of Rusk Creek, which flows over two waterfalls before joining the Big Muddy on its way to the Klickitat. The Wilson Glacier, like the Rusk Glacier, starts below the Roosevelt Cliff and is fed by avalanching snow and ice; however, the Wilson Glacier starts slightly higher at about . It is also fed by an arm of the Lyman Glacier as it flows down from the summit ice cap. The Wilson Glacier terminates at where it is the source of Little Muddy Creek, another tributary of the Klickitat.

The north side is distinguished by two major glaciers, the Lyman and Lava Glaciers. Like the Adams Glacier, the Lyman Glacier is characterized by deep crevasses and many icefalls as it cascades down from the summit ice cap. It is divided into two arms by a very rugged ridge at and terminates at . The Lava Glacier originates in a large cirque below the summit at about , sandwiched between the North Cleaver on the west and the Lava Ridge to the east. It terminates at about . The Lava and Lyman Glaciers are the source of the Muddy Fork of the Cispus River.

The total glacier area on Mount Adams decreased 49%, from to , between 1904 and 2006, with the greatest loss occurring before 1949. Since 1949, the total glacier area has been relatively stable with a small amount of decline since the 1990s.

===Surrounding area===

Mount Adams is surrounded by a variety of other volcanic features and volcanoes. It stands near the center of a north–south trending volcanic field that is about wide and long, from just south of the Goat Rocks to Guler Mountain, the vent farthest south in the field. This field includes over 120 vents; about 25 of these are considered flank volcanoes of Mount Adams. The largest flank volcano is a basaltic shield volcano on Adams east base called Goat Butte. This structure is at least 150,000 years old.
Little Mount Adams is a symmetrical cinder cone on top of the Ridge of Wonders on Adams&#x27; southeast flank.

Potato Hill is a cinder cone on Adams&#x27; north side that was created in the late Pleistocene and stands above its lava plain.

Lavas from its base flowed into the Cispus Valley where they were later modified by glaciers. At the level on Adams&#x27; south flank is South Butte. The lavas associated with this structure are all younger than Suksdorf Ridge but were emplaced before the end of the last ice age.

Several relatively young obvious lava flows exist in the area around Adams. Most of these flows are on the north side of the mountain and include the flow in the Mutton Creek area, Devils Garden, the Takh Takh Meadows Flow, and the much larger Muddy Fork Lava Flow to the north of Devils Garden. Only one obvious flow appears on the south slopes of Adams, the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Other smaller flows exist in various locations around the mountain as well.

The many other vents and volcanoes encompassed by the Mount Adams field include Glaciate Butte and Red Butte on the north, King Mountain, Meadow Butte, Quigley Butte, and Smith Butte on the south, with others interspersed throughout.

Located about north of Adams is Goat Rocks Wilderness and the heavily eroded ruins of a stratovolcano that is much older than Adams. Unlike Adams, the Goat Rocks volcano was periodically explosive and deposited ash 2.5 million years ago that later solidified into thick tuff layers.

In the area surrounding Mount Adams, many caves have formed around inactive lava vents. These caves, usually close to the surface, can be hundreds of feet (meters) deep and wide. A few of the more well known caves include the Cheese Cave, Ice Cave, and Deadhorse Caves. Cheese Cave has the largest bore of the caves near Adams with a diameter of and a length of over . Ice cave, which is made up of several sections created by several sinkholes, has an ice section that is long and in diameter and noted for its ice formations. From the same entrance, the tube continues another to the west. Deadhorse Cave is a massive network of lava tubes. It is the most complex lava tube in the United States with of passage. These caves are all just outside of Trout Lake. These and many other caves in the Trout Lake area were at one time part of a huge system that originated at the Indian Heaven volcanic field. The most obscure caves around Adams are the Windholes on the southeast side near Island Cabin Campground.

== Geology ==

Adams is made of several overlapping cones that together form an  base which is elongated in its north–south axis and covers an area of . The volcano has a volume of placing it second only to Mount Shasta in that category among the Cascade stratovolcanoes. Mount Adams was created by the subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate, which is located just off the coast of the Pacific Northwest.

Mount Adams was born in the mid- to late Pleistocene and grew in several pulses of mostly lava-extruding eruptions. Each eruptive cycle was separated from one another by long periods of dormancy and minor activity, during which, glaciers eroded the mountain to below . Potassium-argon dating has identified three such eruptive periods; the first occurring 520,000 to 500,000 years ago, the second 450,000 years ago, and the third 40,000 to 10,000 years ago. Most of these eruptions and therefore most of the volcano, consist of lava flows with little tephra. The loose material that makes up much of Adams&#x27; core is made of brecciated lava.

Andesite and basalt flows formed a thick circle around the base of Mount Adams, and filled existing depressions and ponded in valleys. Most of the volcano is made of andesite together with a handful of dacite and pyroclastic flows which erupted early in Adams&#x27; development. The present main cone was built when Adams was capped by a glacier system in the last ice age. The lava that erupted was shattered when it came in contact with the ice and the cone interior is therefore made of easily eroded andesite fragments. Since its construction, constant emissions of heat and caustic gases have transformed much of the rock into clays (mostly kaolinite), iron oxides, sulfur-rich compounds and quartz.

The present eruptive cone above was constructed sometime between 40,000 to 10,000 years ago. Since that time the volcano has erupted at least ten times, generally from above . One of the more recent flows issued from South Butte and created the long by wide A.G. Aiken Lava Bed. This flow looks young but has 3,500-year-old Mount St. Helens ash on it, meaning it is at least that old. Of a similar age are the Takh Takh Meadows and Muddy Fork lava flows. The lowest vent to erupt since the main cone was constructed is Smith Butte on the south slope of Adams. The last lava known to have erupted from Adams is an approximately 1000-year-old flow that emerged from a vent at about on Battlement Ridge.
The Trout Lake Mudflow is the youngest large debris flow from Adams and the only large one since the end of the last Ice Age. The flow dammed Trout Creek and covered of the White Salmon River valley. Impounded water later formed Trout Lake. The Great Slide of 1921 started close to the headwall of the White Salmon Glacier and was the largest avalanche on Adams in historic time. The slide fell about and its debris covered about of the upper Salt Creek area. Steam vents were reported active at the slide source for three years, leading to speculation that the event was started with a small steam explosion. This was the only debris flow in Mount Adams&#x27; recorded history, but there are five known lahars.

Since then, thermal anomalies (hot spots) and gas emissions (including hydrogen sulfide) have occurred especially on the summit plateau and indicate that Adams is dormant, not extinct. Future eruptions from Adams will probably follow patterns set by previous events and will thus be flank lava flows of andesite or basalt. Because the primary products were andesite, the eruptions that occur on Adams tend to have a low to moderate explosiveness and present less of a hazard than the violent eruptions of St. Helens and some of the other Cascade volcanoes. However, since the interior of the main cone is little more than a pile of fragmented lava and hydrothermally altered rock, there is a potential for very large landslides and other debris flows.
In 1997, Adams experienced two slides seven weeks apart that were the largest slides in the Cascades, ignoring the catastrophic landslide eruption of Mount St. Helens, since a slide that occurred on Little Tahoma in 1963. The first occurred at the end of August and consisted of mainly snow and ice with some rock. It fell from a similar location and in a similar path to the slide of 1921. The second slide that year occurred in late October and originated high on Battlement Ridge just below The Castle. It consisted of mainly rock and flowed three miles down the Klickitat Glacier and the Big Muddy Creek streambed. Both slides were estimated to have moved as much as of material.

The Indian Heaven volcanic field is located between St. Helens and Adams and within the Indian Heaven Wilderness. Its principal feature is an long linear zone of shield volcanoes, cinder cones, and flows with volumes of up to with the highest peak, Lemei Rock. The shield volcanoes, which form the backbone of the volcanic field, are located on the northern and southern sides of the field. Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams are on the western and the eastern sides.

To the east, across the Klickitat River, lies the Simcoe Mountains volcanic field. This area contains many small shield volcanoes and cinder cones of mainly alkalic intraplate basalt with fractionated intermediate alkalic products, subordinate subalkaline mafic lavas, and several rhyolites as secondary products. There are about 205 vents that were active between 4.2 million and 600 thousand years ago.

Seismic activity around Adams is very low and it is one of the quietest volcanoes in Oregon and Washington. It is monitored by the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network and the Cascades Volcano Observatory via a seismic station on the southwest flank of the mountain.

During the month of September 2024, the U.S. Geological Survey Cascades Volcano Observatory recorded six earthquakes ranging in magnitudes 0.9 to 2.0. With a normal rate of one earthquake every 2–3 years, this is above background levels, and the most since recordkeeping began in 1982. The USGS plans to install temporary seismic stations around Mount Adams to better estimate the size and depth of these earthquakes.

==Recreation==
Like many other Cascade volcanoes, Mount Adams offers many recreational activities, including mountain climbing, backcountry skiing, hiking and backpacking, berry picking, camping, boating, fishing, rafting, photography, wildlife viewing, and scenic driving among other things.

The Mount Adams Wilderness along the west slope of Mount Adams offers an abundance of opportunities for hiking, backpacking, backcountry camping, mountain climbing and equestrian sports. Trails in the wilderness pass through dry east-side and moist west-side forests, with views of Mt. Adams and its glaciers, tumbling streams, open alpine forests, parklands, and a variety of wildflowers among lava flows and rimrocks. A Cascades Volcano Pass from the United States Forest Service (USFS) is required for activities above from June through September.

On the north side, the Midway High Lakes Area, which lies mostly outside the wilderness area, is one of the more popular areas around Mount Adams. The area is made up of four large lakes, Council Lake, Takhlakh Lake, Ollalie Lake, and Horseshoe Lake; one small lake, Green Mountain Lake; and a group of small lakes, Chain of Lakes. The area offers developed and primitive camping as well as a good number of trails for hiking and backpacking. Most trails are open to horses and many outside the wilderness are open to motorcycles. More scenery similar to what is encountered in the Mount Adams Wilderness abounds. The area also offers boating and fishing opportunities on several of the lakes.

On the south side of Adams, the Morrison Creek area provides additional opportunities for hiking, backpacking, biking, and equestrian sports with several long loop trails. A few small and primitive campgrounds exist in the area, including the Wicky Creek Shelter. Generally, there are trailheads at these campgrounds.

On the southeast side of the mountain, the Mount Adams Recreation Area, another very popular area, offers activities such as hiking, camping, picnicking, and fishing. The area features Bird Creek Meadows, a popular picnic and hiking area noted for its outstanding display of wildflowers, and exceptional views of Mount Adams and its glaciers, as well as Mount Hood to the south. Some areas of the Yakama Indian Reservation are open for recreation, while other areas are open only to members of the tribe.

=== Climbing ===

Each year, thousands of outdoor enthusiasts attempt to summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription on a rock at Piker&#x27;s Peak indicates. &quot;You are a piker if you think this is the summit. Don&#x27;t crab, the mountain was here first.&quot; Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route&#x27;s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of the north and west sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous for a variety of reasons and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.

====Routes====
There are 25 main routes to the summit with alternates of those main routes. They range in difficulty from the relatively easy non-technical South Spur (South Climb) route to the extremely challenging and dangerous Victory Ridge, Rusk Glacier Headwall, and Wilson Glacier Headwall routes up Roosevelt Cliff.

===Hiking===
While the summit is the main draw for many who visit Adams, many trails pass through the area around Mount Adams where visitors can find extensive vistas, local history, displays of wildflowers, lava formations, and several waterfalls.

One such trail is the unofficially named &quot;Round the Mountain Trail&quot; that encircles Mount Adams and is approximately long. It is called the &quot;Round the Mountain Trail&quot; unofficially because it is made up of three different named trails and an area where there is no trail. The section of the trail on the Yakama Indian Reservation may require special permits.
Many trails access the &quot;Round the Mountain Trail&quot; in the Mount Adams Wilderness. On the south, the Shorthorn Trail #16 leaves from near the Morrison Creek Campground, and the South Climb Trail #183 starts at Cold Springs Trailhead/Campground and heads up the South Spur, the most popular climbing route to the summit. On the west side, there are three trails going up: the Stagman Ridge Trail #12, Pacific Crest Trail #2000, and the Riley Creek Trail #64. There are four trails providing access to the &quot;Round the Mountain Trail&quot; on the north side: the Divide Camp Trail #112, Killen Creek Trail #113, Muddy Meadows Trail #13, and the Pacific Crest Trail again as it heads down the mountain to the north. These trails accessing the &quot;Round the Mountain Trail&quot; generally gain between and in between and . Trails are mostly snow-covered from early winter until early summer. Other popular trails in the Mount Adams Wilderness include the Lookingglass Lake Trail #9A, High Camp Trail #10, Salt Creek Trail #75, Crofton Butte Trail #73, and the Riley Connector Trail #64A.
In the Mount Adams Recreation Area, many of the trails are geared toward leisurely walks and are located in the Bird Creek Meadows area. There are many loop trails at Bird Creek Meadows, including the Trail of the Flowers #106 in the main picnic area. Trails travel through meadows and past cold mountain streams and waterfalls, including Crooked Creek Falls. Hikers can access the Hellroaring Overlook, where they can view Hellroaring Meadows, a glacial valley about down from the viewpoint precipice. From here, hikers can gaze up at Mount Adams, the Mazama Glacier, and various waterfalls tumbling off of high cliffs below the glaciers terminus. Little Mount Adams , a symmetrical cinder cone on top of the Ridge of Wonders, rises from the northeast end of Hellroaring Meadow and the Hellroaring Creek valley. A trail used to ascend from Bench Lake at the bottom of the canyon to the east base of the peak, but this trail has recently been abandoned. To reach the top, hikers must traverse rocky terrain; and if they exist, user-made trails.

High Lakes Trail #116, the namesake of the Midway High Lakes Area, crosses the relatively flat area on the north side of the mountain following a trail the Yakama Native Americans used for picking huckleberries. Like several other trails around Adams, this trail has extensive views of the mountain. Other trails, like the Takh Takh Meadows Trail #136, pass through meadows and old lava flows. One of the longest trails on the Gifford Pinchot, Boundary Trail #1, has its eastern terminus in the Midway High Lakes area at Council Lake. Other trails in the area include the Council Bluff Trail #117, Green Mountain Trail #110, and East Canyon Trail #265.

Several long trails pass through the Morrison Creek area on the south side of the mountain. The Snipes Mountain Trail #11 follows the eastern edge of the A.G. Aiken Lava Bed from the lower end for to the Round the Mountain Trail. The Cold Springs Trail #72 follows the western edge for . Other trails in the area include the Gotchen Trail #40, Morrison Creek Trail #39, and Pineway Trail #71.

===Camping===

Campgrounds near Mount Adams are open during the snow-free months of summer. Campgrounds in the area include the Takhlakh Lake Campground, offering views across the lake of Mount Adams; Olallie Lake; Horseshoe Lake; Killen Creek; Council Lake; and Keenes Horse Camp. Adams Fork Campground and Twin Falls Campground are located along the Lewis and Cispus Rivers. Most lakes within the Midway High Lakes Area offer scenic views of Mount Adams and its glaciers. Adams Fork Campground, Cat Creek Campground, and Twin Falls Campground are located nearer to Mount Adams and are just a few of the many campgrounds along the scenic Lewis and Cispus Rivers.
The Morrison Creek area has three designated campgrounds: Morrison Creek Campground, Mount Adams Horse Camp, and the Wicky Creek Shelter. Many climbers also camp at the Cold Springs Trailhead.

There are three campgrounds in the Mount Adams Recreation Area. A campground is located at Bird Lake, Mirror Lake, and Bench Lake. Bench Lake is the largest campground of the three and has excellent views up the Hellroaring Canyon.

Farther down the southeast slope of Adams, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has two campgrounds along Bird Creek: Bird Creek Campground and Island Cabin Campground. Island Cabin is also used in winter by snowmobilers.

Several of the campgrounds in the National Forest and all campgrounds in the Mount Adams Recreation Area require fees. The campgrounds on DNR lands require a Discover Pass.

===Winter recreation===
For winter recreation, there are a number of Washington state sno-parks on the south side that are popular with snowmobilers and cross-country skiers. There are three sno-parks on Mount Adams south slope: Snow King, Pineside, and Smith Butte Sno-parks. The south side of the mountain, especially the A.G. Aiken Lava Bed, is especially popular with snowmobilers and skiers. The Mount Adams Recreation Highway (FR 80) is plowed all the way to Pineside and Snow King Sno-parks at about elevation for most of the year, as long as there is enough money in the Forest Service&#x27;s winter budget. Smith Butte Sno-park, at about , is accessible in low-snow years. Most of the time, the road is not plowed all the way to Smith Butte. The U.S. Forest Service does this to not dry up the forest service&#x27;s snowplowing funds.

While the south side has several sno-parks near Adams, the north side has only one nearby, the Orr Creek Sno-park. This sno-park provides winter access to the Midway High Lakes Area. All the sno-parks in the area require a Washington state Sno-Park Permit.

==History==
===Native American legends===
Native Americans in the area have composed many legends concerning the three &quot;smoking mountains&quot; that guard the Columbia River. According to the Bridge of the Gods tale, Wy&#x27;east (Mount Hood) and Pahto (Mount Adams, also called Paddo or Klickitat by Native peoples) were the sons of the Great Spirit. The brothers both competed for the love of the beautiful La-wa-la-clough (Mount St. Helens). When La-wa-la-clough chose Pahto, Wy&#x27;east struck his brother hard so that Pahto&#x27;s head was flattened and Wy&#x27;east took La-wa-la-clough from him (thus attempting to explain Adams&#x27; squat appearance). Other versions of the story state that losing La-wa-la-clough caused Pahto such grief that he dropped his head in shame.

In a Klickitat legend, the chief of the gods, Tyhee Saghalie, came to The Dalles with his two sons. The sons quarreled about who would settle where. To settle the dispute, Saghalie shot an arrow to the west and to the north and told his sons to find them and to settle where the arrows had fallen. So one settled in the Willamette Valley and the other in the area between the Yakima and Columbia Rivers and they became the ancestors of the Multnomah and Klickitat tribes respectively. To separate the tribes, Saghalie raised the Cascade Mountains. He also created the &quot;Bridge of the Gods&quot; as a way for the tribes to meet with one another easily. A &quot;witch-woman,&quot; whose name was Loowit, lived on the bridge and had control of the only fire in the world. She wanted to give the tribes fire to improve their condition and Saghalie consented. He was so pleased with Loowit&#x27;s faithfulness that he offered Loowit whatever she wanted. She asked for youth and beauty and Saghalie granted her wish. Suitors came from near and far until finally she could not decide between Klickitat and Wiyeast. Klickitat and Wiyeast went to war over the matter until finally Sahalie decided to punish them for creating such chaos. He broke the Bridge of the Gods and put the three lovers to death. However, to honor their beauty, he raised up three mountains: Wiyeast (Hood), Klickitat (Adams), and Loowit (St. Helens).

In a similar legend from the Klickitats, there was a large inland sea between the Cascades and the Rocky Mountains. The Native Americans lived on the sea and each year they would hold two large powwows at Mount Multnomah, one in the spring and one in the fall. The demigod Koyoda Spielei lived among them and settled disputes among the living things of the earth, including the mountains Pa-toe (Adams) and Yi-east (Hood), sons of the Great Spirit Soclai Tyee. For many years, peace prevailed over the land. Then a beautiful female mountain moved to the valley between Pa-toe and Yi-east. She fell in love with Yi-east, but liked to flirt with Pa-toe. This caused the two mountains to quarrel with each other and it quickly escalated into an all-out brawl. Ignoring Koyoda&#x27;s calls for peace, they belched forth smoke and ash and threw hot rocks at each other. Sometime later, they paused for a rest and discovered the catastrophe they had caused. The forests and meadows had been burnt to the ground and many animals and other living things had been killed. The earth had been shaken so severely that a hole had been created in the mountains and the sea had drained away and the Bridge of the Gods was formed. The female mountain had hid herself in a cave during the battle and because they could no longer find her, they were about to resume fighting. However, while they had been fighting, Koyoda went to Soclai and told him what was happening. Soclai arrived in time to stop them from resuming their quarrel. He decreed that the female mountain should remain in the cave forever and the Bridge of the Gods was to be a covenant of peace between the mountains that he would cause to fall if they ever resumed their quarrel. He also placed an ugly old woman, known as Loo-wit, as a mountain to guard the bridge and remind the brothers that beauty is never permanent. After many years, the signs of the great battle and the evidence of the inland sea had disappeared and there was happiness and contentment over the earth. The female mountain wished to come out of her cave and grew very lonely. To ease her loneliness, Soclai sent the Bats, a tribe of beautiful birds, to be her companions. Yi-east eventually learned that the Bats were her guardians and carried out secret communication with the female mountain through them. He befriended Loo-wit and crossed the bridge at night to meet with the female mountain. One night, he stayed too long and had to hurry to get back to his proper place. He caused the ground to shake so much in his haste that a large rock fell and blocked the entrance to the cave. When Soclai found this, he was furious with the Bats and punished them by turning them into bats that are seen today. He allowed the female mountain to remain out of the cave on her promise to be good, but would not allow her and Yi-east to be married, fearing the inevitable quarrel that might start again. He did promise to look for a mate for Pa-toe, hoping this would initiate a lasting peace. However, because of his many duties, he forgot this promise, and the two mountains were only held in check by his threats. Eventually, when Soclai was in another part of the world, they resumed their quarrel and created chaos again. Their violence broke the Bridge of the Gods and destroyed the landscape again. Loo-wit, in her attempts to stop the two brothers, was badly burned and scarred; and when the bridge collapsed, she fell with it. Finally, Pa-toe won the battle and Yi-east admitted defeat. Soclai returned from where he had been, but he was too late to avert the disaster. He found Loo-wit and because she had been faithful in her guardianship, he rewarded her by giving her her greatest desire, youth, and beauty. Having received this gift, she moved to the west side of the Cascades and remains there to this day as Mount St. Helens. Since Pa-toe won the battle, the female mountain belonged to him. She was heartbroken but took her place at his side. She soon fell at his feet and into a deep sleep from which she never awoke. She is now known as Sleeping Beauty. Pa-toe became so sad that he caused her deep sleep, he lowered his own head in remorse.
The Yakamas also have a legend attempting to explain Adams&#x27; squat appearance. Long ago, the Sun was a man and he had five wives who were mountains: Plash-Plash (the Goat Rocks), Wahkshum (the Simcoe Mountains), Pahto (Adams), Rainier, and St. Helens. Because she was the third wife to be greeted by the Sun in the morning, Pahto became jealous. She broke down both Plash-Plash and Wahkshum, but left Rainier and St. Helens alone. She was happy that she was now the first to be greeted, but wanted more, so she crossed the Columbia and took plants and animals from the mountains there. The other mountains were afraid of her, but Klah Klahnee (the Three Sisters) convinced Wyeast (Hood) to confront Pahto. Wyeast initially tried being nice, but Pahto would have none of it. So Wyeast hit her head and knocked it off, creating Devils Garden. Wyeast then shared what Pahto had taken with the rest of the mountains. After this, Pahto became mean and she would send thunderstorms, heavy rain, and snow to the valleys below. The Great Spirit had been watching all this time and came to Pahto. He gave her a new head in the form of White Eagle and his son Red Eagle and he reminded her that she was his daughter. Pahto repented and promised to stop being mean and greedy.

In many of the legends of the Cascade Mountains, there are thunderbirds that live on them and Adams is no exception. This particular thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized the inhabitants of the land. Speelyi, the Klickitat coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the feather and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the feather with no effect. He paused and suddenly the magic feather let loose a terrific volley of thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.

Several other tribes have legends involving battles and disagreements between the great peaks. The Cowlitz and Chehalis have a legend where Rainier and St. Helens were female mountains and quarreled over Adams, the male mountain. In a different legend from the Cowlitz, St. Helens was the man and Pahto (Adams) and Takhoma (Rainier) were his wives and the two wives quarreled with each other. A thunderbird legend from the Yakamas has a terrific battle between the thunderbird, Enumklah, and his five wives, Tahoma (Rainier), Pahto (Adams), Ah-kee-kun (Hood), Low-we-lat-Klah (St. Helens), and Simcoe. Pahto and Tahoma were badly beaten, Ah-kee-kun and Low-we-lat-Klah escaped without injury, and Simcoe suffered the greatest injury for starting the battle.

===Exploration===
Adams was known to the Native Americans as Pahto (with various spellings) and Klickitat. In various tribal languages (Plateau Penutian, Chinookan, Salishan), Pahto means &quot;high up&quot;, &quot;very high&quot;, &quot;standing up&quot;, or &quot;high sloping mountain&quot;. The Klickitat name is of Klickitat origin and comes from the Chinookan for &quot;beyond&quot;.

In 1805, on the journey westward down the Columbia, the Lewis and Clark Expedition recorded seeing the mountain; noting that it was &quot;a high mountain of emence hight covered with snow&quot; and thought it &quot;perhaps the highest pinnacle in America.&quot; They initially misidentified it as Mount St. Helens, which had been previously discovered and named by George Vancouver. On the return journey in 1806, they recorded seeing both, but did not give Adams a name, only calling it &quot;a very high humped mountain&quot;. This is the earliest recorded sighting of the volcano by European explorers.

For several decades after Lewis and Clark sighted the mountain, people continued to get Adams confused with St. Helens, due in part to their somewhat similar appearance and similar latitude. In the 1830s, Hall J. Kelley led a campaign to rename the Cascade Range as the President&#x27;s Range and rename each major Cascade mountain after a former President of the United States. Mount Adams was not known to Kelley and was thus not in his plan. Mount Hood, in fact, was designated by Kelley to be renamed after President John Adams and St. Helens was to be renamed after George Washington. In a mistake or deliberate change by mapmaker and proponent of the Kelley plan, Thomas J. Farnham, the names for Hood and St. Helens were interchanged. And, likely because of the confusion about which mountain was St. Helens, he placed the &quot;Mount Adams&quot; name north of Mount Hood and about east of Mount St. Helens. By what would seem sheer coincidence, there was in fact a large mountain there to receive the name. Since the mountain had no official name at the time, Kelley&#x27;s name stuck even though the rest of his plan failed. However, it was not official until 1853, when the Pacific Railroad Surveys, under the direction of Washington Territory governor Isaac I. Stevens, determined its location, described the surrounding countryside, and placed the name on the map.

Since its discovery by explorers, the height of Adams has also been subject to revision. The topographer for the Pacific Railroad Surveys, Lt. Johnson K. Duncan, and George Gibbs, ethnologist and naturalist for the expedition, thought it was about the same height as St. Helens. Its large, uneven size apparently contributed to the underestimation. The Northwest Boundary Survey listed Adams as having an elevation of while a later United States Coast and Geodetic Survey gave it an elevation of . The height was more closely determined in 1895 by members of the Mazamas mountaineering club, William A. Gilmore, Professor Edgar McClure, and William Gladstone Steel. Using a boiling point thermometer, mercurial barometer, and an aneroid barometer, they determined the elevation to be respectively. None of these numbers were used on any map because that same year, 1895, the US Geological Survey (USGS), using a triangulation method, also measured the height of several mountains in the Cascades and they measured Adams as having an elevation of . The USGS further refined their measurement sometime in late 1909 or early 1910 to and again in 1970 to for the release of the Mount Adams East 1:24000 quadrangle. The current elevation, , is generated by the new method, NAVD88, for calculating altitudes.

Claude Ewing Rusk, a local settler and mountaineer, was one of those most familiar with Adams and he was instrumental in many of the names given to places around the mountain. In 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of the mountain and explored, to some extent, all ten of its principle glaciers. This was the first recorded circuit of Adams by a woman and likely the first recorded circuit by anyone. While they were on the east side, they named Avalanche Valley. Later, in 1897, after they had completed an ascent of Adams, they went to the Ridge of Wonders and his mother, awestruck by the scene, named it as such.
No detailed descriptions of Adams or its glaciers existed until Professor William Denison Lyman and Horace S. Lyman published descriptions of three of its glaciers and various other features of the southern flanks of the mountain in 1886. The White Salmon/Avalanche, Mazama, and Klickitat Glaciers were those described. They also postulated Adams to be the source of some of the Columbia River basalt flows. They thought that Adams was within what was originally an enormous caldera that was about one hundred miles across. The southern boundary of this enormous caldera was the anticline ridge that forms the southern border of the Glenwood Valley. Modern geology has since dismissed this theory. From information collected on an outing of the Mazamas in 1895, Professor Lyman expanded his descriptions of those three glaciers in 1896. Adams was finally properly surveyed in 1901, when Rusk led noted geologist/glaciologist Harry Fielding Reid to Adams&#x27; remote location. Reid conducted the first systematic study of the volcano and also named its most significant glaciers, Pinnacle, Adams, Lava, Lyman, and Rusk with suggestions from Rusk. He also named Castle Rock (The Castle), Little Mount Adams, and Red Butte. Reid noted that it was apparent that the glaciers of Adams had been significantly larger during the Little Ice Age. The geologic history of Adams would have to wait another 80 years before it was fully explored.

On the 1895 Mazamas expedition, the first heliography between several of the peaks of the Cascades was attempted with some success. A party on Mount Hood was able to communicate back and forth with the party on Mount Adams, but the parties on Rainier, Baker, Jefferson, and Diamond Peak were not successful, mainly because of dense smoke and logistical problems.
The first ascent of Mount Adams was in 1854 by Andrew Glenn Aiken, Edward Jay Allen, and Andrew J. Burge. While most sources list the aforementioned names, at least one substitutes Colonel Benjamin Franklin Shaw for Andrew Burge. Their route was likely up the North Cleaver because that summer they were improving a newly designated military road that passes through Naches Pass, which is to the north of Adams.

While the north and south faces of Adams are climbed easily, the west and east faces of the mountain were deemed impossible to climb because of the steep cliffs and ice cascades. To some, this assumption was a challenge and for years, C. E. Rusk searched for a way to climb the east face. On one of these excursions, in 1919, Rusk named the Wilson Glacier, Victory Ridge, and the Roosevelt Cliff. It was on this trip that Rusk decided that the Castle held the easiest route up. In 1921, 67 years after the first ascent of Adams, a group from the Cascadians mountaineering club, led by Rusk, completed the first ascent of the precipitous east face of the mountain. Their route took them up the Rusk Glacier, onto Battlement Ridge, up and over The Castle, and across the vast, heavily crevassed eastern side of the summit ice cap. One of the party, Edgar E. Coursen, said that the route was &quot;thrilling to the point of extreme danger.&quot; Others in the party were Wayne E. Richardson, Clarence Truitt, Rolland Whitmore, Robert E. Williams, and Clarence Starcher. Three years later, in 1924, a group of three men from the Mazamas finally climbed the west face of Adams. This route is straightforward, but made difficult by icefalls, mud slips, and easily started rock avalanches.

Some of the caves around Adams were subject to commercial ventures. In the 1860s, ice was gathered from the Ice Cave and shipped to Portland and The Dalles in years of short supply elsewhere. Oddly, a &quot;claim&quot; to the cave using mining laws was used in order to gain exclusive access to the ice. Cheese Cave was used for potato storage in the 1930s and later was home to the Guler Cheese Company, which produced, for a number of years in the 1950s, a bleu cheese similar to the Roquefort produced in Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, France. A legend from the Klickitats regarding the formation of the caves, involves a man and his wife who were of gigantic stature. The man left his wife and married a mouse, which became a woman. His wife was furious and because she threatened to kill the man and the &quot;mouse-wife,&quot; they hid farther up the mountain at a lake. The man&#x27;s wife assumed they were underground and began digging for them. In the process, she dug out the many caves in the area. Eventually, she reached the place where they were and the man allowed her to kill the &quot;mouse-wife&quot; to save his own life. Her blood colored the rocks of the lake red and the place was known as Hool-hool-se, which is from the Native American word for mouse. Eventually, the wife killed the man as well and lived alone in the mountains.

Adams was the feature of a 1915 documentary &quot;When the Mountains Call&quot;. This film documented the journey from Portland to the summit and showed many of the sights along the way.

===Forest Service operations===

Adams and the lands surrounding it were initially set aside as part of the Mount Rainier Forest Reserve under the Department of the Interior in 1897. Eight years later, in 1905, the Bureau of Forestry, later the Forest Service, was created under the Department of Agriculture and all the Forest Reserves were transferred to the new agency. In 1907, the Forest Reserves were renamed to National Forests and in 1908, the Rainier National Forest was divided among three Forests. The southern half became the Columbia National Forest. The name was changed in 1949 to honor the first Chief of the Forest, Gifford Pinchot. In 1964, the lands around Mount Adams were set aside as a wilderness.

Adams is home to the oldest building on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, the Gotchen Creek Guard Station just south of the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Built in 1909, it served as the administrative headquarters of the Mount Adams District until 1916. It was built along a major grazing trail to allow for easy monitoring of the thousands of sheep grazed on the lower slopes. Later, in the 1940s, as the amount of grazing decreased, the station housed the Forest Guards responsible for the area. It has been wrapped in protective foil as a precautionary method to shield it from a large wildfire.
In 1916, the Forest Service began preparations to establish the highest fire lookout in the Pacific Northwest at the top of Adams. This was part of an endeavor that began in 1915 on Mount Hood and 1916 on St. Helens The idea was to situate lookouts far above all low-lying hills and mountains to give the lookouts an immense area for observation without obstructions. Being at , the new lookout would also be the third highest in the world and still is. In 1917, building materials were moved to the base of the mountain and in 1918, Dan Lewis packed the building materials and lumber to the lower portion of Suksdorf Ridge. The following summer was spent hauling the building materials to the top. The four men assigned the job, Arthur &quot;Art&quot; Jones, Adolph Schmid, Julius Wang, and Jessie Robbins, had a difficult task ahead of them until they engineered a way to quickly and, for the most part, safely bring the building materials up the slope using a deadman/rope technique. Construction of the standard D-6 building with a ¼ second story cupola began in the summer of 1920 and was completed a year later by Art, Adolph, James Huffman and Joe Guler. It was manned as a lookout during the last year of its construction through 1924. After which it was abandoned because of the difficulties of operating a lookout that high and because lower level clouds, smoke, and haze frequently and effectively blocked the view of the lower elevations. Arthur Jones was likely the one person most involved in the project, spending five seasons on the mountain. Others who worked on the project or staffed the lookout include Rudolph Deitrich, the last lookout, and Chaffin &quot;Chafe&quot; Johnson.

After the lookout at the summit was abandoned, the Forest Service changed strategies from a few lookouts very high up to many lookouts on lower peaks. They placed many lookouts around Adams including one on the southwest slopes of Adams at Madcat Meadows, one on Goat Butte, one on Council Bluff above Council Lake, and many other places farther from the mountain. Eventually these lookouts became obsolete as airplanes became the cheaper method to spot fires. Almost all of these lookouts have since been abandoned and most have been removed or left to disintegrate. One, Burley Mountain, is staffed every summer and another, Red Mountain, was restored in 2010 and decisions regarding its future are pending. Two lookouts remain nearby on the Yakama Indian Reservation. One, Satus Peak, is staffed every season and the other, Signal Peak, is staffed during periods of high fire danger.

===Sulfur mine===
In 1929, Wade Dean formed the Glacier Mining Company and filed mining claims to the sulfur on Adams&#x27; summit plateau. Beginning in 1932, the first assessment work was done. The initial test pits were dug by hand, but this proved to be dangerous work and an alternative was needed to drill through the up to thick ice cap more safely. The answer was a diamond tipped drilling machine, but, being a heavy machine, it could not be carried up the newly completed horse and mule trail like other supplies. So it winched itself up the mountain using a series of deadman anchors. One hundred sixty-eight pack string trips led by John Perry were made over the course of the mining activities. The crew stayed in the abandoned Forest Service lookout, a tight fit for the usual eight men and their equipment. This problem was alleviated somewhat in the later years of the project when an enclosed lean-to was added to the cabin. Another smaller lean-to was added later. The conditions and weather above could be incredibly variable with the highest temperature of recorded 12 hours before the lowest temperature of . This preliminary mining continued for several years until 1937 when the last crew worked from the summit lookout. In the years following, Dean periodically attempted to restart this venture and in 1946, he and Lt. John Hodgkins made several landings by airplane on the summit ice cap. Although sulfur was found, the amount of the ore that was able to be mined in a season was only enough to make up the cost of getting it off the mountain and was not enough to be competitive. Part of this stemmed from Dean&#x27;s desire that if operations were expanded, an ore as well as passenger transport system was needed, and his desire that Adams not be significantly scarred by the operation. The project was fully abandoned in 1959. Adams is the only large Cascade volcano to have its summit exploited by commercial miners.

==Climate==

Because of its remote location and relative inaccessibility, climate records are poor. The nearest weather station, Potato Hill, has only been measuring precipitation since 1982 and temperatures since 1989. Temperature and precipitation records from Glenwood and Trout Lake, both considerably lower in elevation and farther from the mountain, are more complete and go back further, 1948 at Glenwood and 1924 at Trout Lake. Snowfall records from the three snow stations on Adams cover a number of years but are discontinuous and are limited to the northwest side. The Potato Hill station was monitored monthly from 1950 to 1976 and was replaced in 1982 with the automated precipitation sensor. It was upgraded in 1983 to report snow water equivalent and it was upgraded again in 2006 to report snow depth. The Council Pass station was monitored monthly from 1956 to 1978 and the Divide Meadow station was monitored monthly from 1962 to 1978. Divide Meadow was the most representative of the snow depth on the west side of Adams because it was the highest station on the flanks of the mountain.

Like the rest of the high Cascade mountains, Adams receives a large amount of snow, but because it lies farther east than many of its Washington compatriots, it receives less than one might expect for a mountain of its height. Although snowfall is not measured directly, it can be estimated from the snow depth; and since the Potato Hill station was upgraded to report daily snow depth in 2006, there has been an average of of snow every year. Also since 2006, the most snow to fall in a day was (May 19, 2021), in a month, (Dec 2007), and in a year, (2012).
By April, there is, on average, of snow on the ground at Potato Hill. The average monthly snow depth at Potato Hill has not changed much from the records collected from 1950 to 1976, with only a small decrease in January, February, and May and a small increase in March and April. Records from Council Pass and Divide Meadow also show depth increasing throughout the winter, peaking in April. These two stations average a greater amount of snow than Potato Hill, with an average of at Council Pass and at Divide Meadow by April. Divide Meadow generally receives the most snow, with a record depth of in 1972. The snowpack at Potato Hill starts building in late October to early November and the last of the snow generally melts by the beginning of June, but occasionally lingers into July.

Temperatures and precipitation can be highly variable around Adams, due in part to its geographic location astride the Cascade Crest, which gives it more of a continental influence than some of its neighbors. At Potato Hill, December is the coldest month with an average high of and an average low of . July is the hottest month with an average high of and an average low of . The highest recorded temperature is on June 29, 2021, and the lowest is on November 24, 2010. Average annual precipitation is with January being the wettest month at , slightly more than November and December. Potato Hill averages 159 precipitation days with 53 snow days. In Trout Lake, the coldest month is January with an average high of and an average low of . July is the hottest month with an average high of and an average low of . The highest recorded temperature is in 1939 and the lowest is in 1930. Average annual precipitation is with January being the wettest month with . In Glenwood, the coldest month is December with an average high of and an average low of . August is the hottest month with an average high of and an average low of . The highest recorded temperature is in 1994 and the lowest is in 1983. Average annual precipitation is with December being the wettest month with .

The climate of Adams places it and the immediate area in two different level three eco-regions: the Cascades eco-region and the Eastern Cascades Slopes and Foothills eco-region. Within these two eco-regions are five level four eco-regions: the Western Cascade Mountain Highlands, Cascade Crest Montane Forest, and Cascades Subalpine/Alpine within the Cascades eco-region and the Yakima Plateau and Slopes and Grand Fir Mixed Forest within the Eastern Cascades Slopes and Foothills eco-region. Adams is unique among the Washington volcanoes in that it is in two level three eco-regions as well as being the only one within the Cascade Crest Montane Forest.

==Flora and fauna==

===Flora===

The climate of Adams gives it a large amount of diversity within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf&#x27;s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.

Big Tree, (also known as Trout Lake Big Tree), is a massive ponderosa pine tree in majestic, old growth pine and fir forests at the southern base of Mount Adams. The tree rises to a lofty with a diameter of , and is one of the largest known ponderosa pine trees in the world. As of 2015, however, the tree has been stressed by attacks from pine beetles.

The large diversity of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the herbage and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is more than any other mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. Adams is home to many rare plants including tall bugbane, Suksdorf&#x27;s monkeyflower, northern microseris (&quot;Microceris borealis&quot;), Brewer&#x27;s potentilla (&quot;Potentilla breweri&quot;), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many meadows and wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta paintbrush, arrowleaf ragwort, penstemons, lupines, monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog blueberry, highbush cranberry, sundew, purple cinquefoil, and flatleaf bladderwort, in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob&#x27;s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.

===Fauna===

Adams is home to a fairly wide variety of animal species. Several hoofed mammals call the mountain home: mountain goats, Roosevelt elk, black-tailed deer, and mule deer. Large carnivores include cougar, black bear, coyote, bobcat, and the Cascade mountain fox, an endemic subspecies of the red fox. There have also been sightings of wolverine and unconfirmed reports of wolves. Many small mammals also make Adams their home. Squirrels and chipmunks are numerous throughout the forest. Douglas squirrels, least chipmunks, and Townsend&#x27;s chipmunks live throughout the forest with golden-mantled ground squirrels and California ground squirrels occupying drier areas as well. These squirrels are preyed upon by the elusive and secretive pine martens that also call Adams their home. Hoary marmots and pikas make their home on open rocky areas at any altitude while the elusive snowshoe hare lives throughout the forest.

The profusion of wildflowers attracts a large number of pollinators including butterflies such as Apollos, &quot;Melitaea&quot;, &quot;Coenonympha&quot;, snowflakes, painted ladies, garden whites, swallowtails, skippers, admirals, sulphurs, blues, and fritillaries.
Many birds call Adams home or a stopover on their migration routes. Songbirds include three species of chickadee, two kinglets, several thrushes, warblers, sparrows, and finches. One unique songbird to the high elevations is the gray-crowned rosy finch, who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. Raptors that live in the forest and meadows include &quot;Accipiter&quot;s, red-tailed hawks, golden and bald eagles, ospreys, great horned owls, and falcons. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the hairy woodpecker, downy woodpecker, and white-headed woodpecker. Jays such as the Steller&#x27;s jay and Canada jay are common and the Canada jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the Clark&#x27;s nutcracker with its distinctive call. Swallows and swifts are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. Common mergansers and several other species of water birds can be found on many of the lakes as well. The American dipper with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several grouse species, the sooty, spruce, and ruffed grouse and the white-tailed ptarmigan, call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.

The streams and lakes around Adams offer a number of fish for the angler to seek out. The two most common species, eastern brook trout and rainbow trout (Columbia River redband trout), are in nearly every lake and stream. Brown trout and cutthroat trout appear in most of the lakes in the High Lakes Area and three lakes are home to tiger trout. All the lakes in the High Lakes Area are periodically replanted with varying species of trout. Bull trout can be found in the upper reaches of the Klickitat and Lewis Rivers. Westslope cutthroat trout can be found the Klickitat and cutthroat trout are found in the Lewis River and upper reaches of the Cispus River. Whitefish can be found in the Klickitat, Lewis, and Cispus Rivers. Because of barriers to fish passage (dams on the Lewis and Cowlitz Rivers, falls on the White Salmon River), the only river where anadromous fishes can reach the streams around Adams is the Klickitat River. Chinook salmon, coho salmon, and steelhead, in several different runs, make for the upper reaches of the Klickitat, including those around Adams, every year.

The Conboy Lake National Wildlife Refuge lies at the base of Mount Adams. The refuge covers and contains conifer forests, grasslands, and shallow wetlands. Protected wildlife includes deer, elk, beaver, coyote, otter, small rodents, bald eagle, greater sandhill crane, and the Oregon spotted frog. It and the lands nearby are home to several rare and threatened species of plants and animals including the previously mentioned Oregon spotted frog and greater sandhill crane, Suksdorf&#x27;s milk vetch, rosy owl&#x27;s-clover, Oregon coyote thistle, Mardon skipper, peregrine falcon, and Western gray squirrel.

<doc id="410693" wikidata="Q7242385" url="?curid=410693" title="Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989">
<text>The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 (c. 4) was one of the Prevention of Terrorism Acts of the United Kingdom related to The Troubles in Northern Ireland.

== Powers contained in the Acts ==
The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 had seven parts:

; &quot;Proscribed Organisations&quot; : Allowed for organisations to be made illegal, making membership an arrestable offence. It was also an offence to solicit financial support for any listed group, display signs of public support, or attend a meeting supporting a listed group or addressed by a group member. The maximum penalty was ten years&#x27; imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The initial groups outlawed were the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) in the United Kingdom and numerous loyalist groups within Northern Ireland.

; &quot;Exclusion Orders&quot; : Exclusion orders could be issued &quot;as expedient&quot; to prevent terrorism relating to Northern Ireland. Orders were issued against individuals to either prevent them entering or being in Great Britain, to exclude them from Northern Ireland, or to exclude them from the United Kingdom. It was an offence to breach an order or to aid another in effecting entry, the maximum sentence was five years&#x27; imprisonment and an unlimited fine.

; &quot;Financial Assistance for Terrorism&quot; : As well as the provision under the first part of the Act, contributing, receiving or soliciting financial support for terrorism was an offence under this part also. Additionally, it was an offence to contribute any other resources; to assist in the retention or control of funds for proscribed groups or terrorist acts; or to fail to disclose to the police any suspicions notwithstanding any other restriction. The maximum penalty was fourteen years&#x27; imprisonment and an unlimited fine.

; &quot;Arrest, Detention and Control of Entry&quot; : This part allowed for the arrest of individuals without a warrant and on reasonable suspicion that they were guilty of an offence under the Act or otherwise &quot;concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism&quot;. The period of initial detention was up to 48 hours, this could be extended by a maximum of five additional days by the Home Secretary. The detainee was exempted from certain provisions of other Acts relating to the arrest procedure and the legal protection of those arrested. This part also allowed for streamlined search procedures of persons or property and checks under the Act on persons at port or other border controls.

The remaining parts of the Act (&quot;Information, Proceedings and Interpretation&quot;, &quot;Further Provisions for Northern Ireland&quot;, and &quot;Supplementary&quot;) are largely technical, although the Northern Ireland provisions extend the right to search property, restricts remission for those convicted of statutory offences, and tightens control over the granting of licenses under the Explosives Act 1875 (new explosives factories and magazines).</text><links>

<text>Henry Gwiazda (born 1952, silent &quot;i&quot;, Polish for &quot;star&quot;) is a composer who specializes in virtual audio, the simulation of a three-dimensional sound space in either headphones or precisely positioned speakers. He composes what may be called musique concrète, using samples usually without “tinker[ing]” with them.

Gwiazda is credited with sound effects, sampler, electric guitar and voice. He also composed, published, produced and engineered. Focal Point 3D Audio by Bo Gehring.

*&quot;Gwiazda produces &#x27;animated&#x27; audioscapes, oddly situating twisted and chopped real-sound samples . . . combining elements that don&#x27;t have any clear relationship into compositions of surprising unity.&quot; - reviewed in CMJ by Robin Edgerton Douglas Wolk.

Gwiazda studied at the Eastman School of Music, and at the Hartt School (University of Hartford), where he was a student of Arnold Franchetti.

<doc id="410698" wikidata="Q1262739" url="?curid=410698" title="JAT Flight 367">
<text>JAT (Yugoslav Airlines) Flight 367 was a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 aircraft (registration YU-AHT) which exploded shortly after overflying NDB Hermsdorf (located in or around Hinterhermsdorf, in the present-day municipality of Sebnitz), East Germany, while en route from Stockholm, Sweden, to Belgrade, SFR Yugoslavia, on 26 January 1972. The aircraft, piloted by Captain Ludvik Razdrih and First Officer Ratko Mihić, broke into three pieces and spun out of control, crashing near the village of Srbská Kamenice in Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic). Of the 28 on board, 27 were killed upon ground impact and one Serbian crew member, Vesna Vulović (1950–2016), survived. She holds the Guinness world record for surviving the highest fall without a parachute at .

==Cause==
The secondary crew of JAT Flight 367, flying from Stockholm to Belgrade with stopovers in Copenhagen and Zagreb, arrived in Denmark on the morning of 25 January 1972. Flight 367 departed from Stockholm Arlanda Airport at 1:30 p.m. (13:30 UTC) on 26 January. The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32, landed at Copenhagen Airport at 2:30 p.m., where it was taken over by Vulović and her colleagues. &quot;As it was late, we were in the terminal and saw it park,&quot; Vulović said. &quot;I saw all the passengers and crew deplane. One man seemed terribly annoyed. It was not only me that noticed him either. Other crew members saw him, as did the station manager in Copenhagen. I think it was the man who put the bomb in the baggage. I think he had checked in a bag in Stockholm, got off in Copenhagen and never re-boarded the flight.&quot;

Flight 367 departed from Copenhagen Airport at 3:15 p.m. At 4:01 p.m, an explosion tore through the DC-9&#x27;s baggage compartment. The explosion caused the aircraft to break apart over the Czechoslovak village of Srbská Kamenice. Vulović was the only survivor of the 28 passengers and crew. Some reports stated Vulović was at the rear of the aircraft when the explosion occurred, but she has stated she was told that she was found in the middle section of the plane. She was discovered by villager Bruno Honke, who heard her screaming amid the wreckage. Her turquoise uniform was covered in blood and her stiletto heels had been torn off by the force of the impact. Honke had been a medic during World War II and was able to keep Vulović alive until rescuers arrived. Vulović was in a coma for 27 days and was temporarily paralyzed from the waist down, but survived. She continued working for JAT, holding a desk job.

Between 1962 and 1982, the Croatian nationalist group Ustaše carried out 128 terror attacks against Yugoslavian civilian and military targets. The Yugoslav authorities suspected that émigré Croatian terrorists were to blame for bringing down Flight 367. The day of the crash, a bomb exploded aboard a train travelling from Vienna to Zagreb, injuring six. A man, describing himself as a Croatian nationalist, called the Swedish newspaper &quot;Kvällsposten&quot; the following day and claimed responsibility for the bombing of Flight 367. No arrests have yet been made. The Czechoslovak Civil Aviation Authority later attributed the explosion to a briefcase bomb.
On 10 October 2024, TV4&#x27;s investigative program &quot;Kalla fakta&quot; aired a documentary that found a group of Croat nationalists based in Sweden and associated with Ustaše were implicated in the bombing. Reporter Tonchi Percan discovered names of suspects and found previously classified documents from the Yugoslav security service. The documents contains detailed information about how the crime was planned, financed, and executed. For each one of the seven individuals, the documents contains intelligence from between 38 and 59 different secret agents. The designated men were exiled Croats associated with Otpor and HRB from Ustashe&#x27;s movement, residing in Sweden and Germany. &quot;Kalla fakta&quot; interviewed the three Swedish men who were still alive in 2024; two of them denied involvement in the bombing, while the third claimed not to remember anything.

==Shootdown conspiracy theory==

===Theory===
The officially stated cause of the Flight 367 crash was challenged occasionally over the years by conspiracy theories. For example, in 1997 the Czech periodical &quot;Letectví a kosmonautika&quot; reported that the plane was shot down by mistake by Czechoslovak air defenses.

The discussion about different aspects of the crash was reopened on 8 January 2009, when German news magazine &quot;Tagesschau&quot; featured a report by investigative journalists Peter Hornung and Pavel Theiner. Allegedly based on newly obtained documents mainly from the Czech Civil Aviation Authority, they concluded that it was &quot;extremely likely&quot; that the plane had been mistakenly shot down only a few hundred meters above the ground by a MiG fighter of the Czechoslovak Air Force, having been mistaken for an enemy aircraft while attempting a forced landing. All the evidence suggesting that the plane was destroyed at high altitude by explosives placed in a suitcase would be therefore have been forged by Czechoslovak secret police.

As evidence that the DC-9 had broken up at a lower altitude, the journalists cited eyewitnesses from Srbská Kamenice, who had seen the plane burning but still intact below the low-hanging clouds, and confirmation of a Serbian aviation expert (who had been present at the crash site) that the debris area had been much too small for a crash from high altitude; it also referred to sightings of a second plane. According to Hornung, Flight 367 got into difficulties, &quot;went into a steep descent and found itself over a sensitive military area&quot;, close to a nuclear weapons facility. However, Hornung himself stated that for his theory &quot;there are only indications, no evidence&quot;.

===Skepticism===
Vulović (who had no memory of the crash or the flight after boarding) referred to the claims that the plane attempted a forced landing or descended to such a low altitude as &quot;nebulous nonsense&quot;. A representative of &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, according to the German paper &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot;, stated that &quot;it seems that at the time Guinness was duped by this swindle just like the rest of the media.&quot;

The Civilian Aviation Authority dismissed the conspiracy theory as media speculation, that appears from time to time. Its spokeswoman added that Authority experts would not comment on them and that findings of the official investigation are being questioned mostly because of the media attractiveness of the story.

The Czech magazine &quot;Technet&quot; quoted a Czech army expert: &quot;In case of violation of the air space, the incident would not be solved by anti-air missiles, but by fighter planes. Also it would not be possible to conceal such incident, as there would be approximately 150–200 people knowing about the incident. They would not have any reason to not tell about the incident today.&quot; A potential missile launch would be audible and especially visible for thousands of people long afterwards. He further claims that for the Yugoslav plane, it was technically impossible to dive in a &quot;state of emergency&quot; from the proven flight level to the low altitude and place where it was allegedly shot down. He also states that the debris area wasn&#x27;t &quot;too small&quot; but that the main parts were more than 1.5 km apart. Additionally, the Czechoslovak Air Defense soldier who operated the radar on the day of the crash stated in a 2009 interview that any Czechoslovak jet fighters would be noticed by West German air defense.

The main evidence against such a theory is the flight data obtained from the black box, which provided the exact data about the time, speed, direction, acceleration and altitude of the plane at the moment of the explosion. Both black boxes were opened and analysed by their respective service companies in Amsterdam in the presence of experts from Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and the Netherlands.

Vulović&#x27;s fall was the subject of a &quot;MythBusters&quot; episode, which concluded it was possible to survive the fall depending on how the wreckage someone was sitting in landed.

== Vesna Vulović ==

Vesna Vulović holds the official record in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; for the highest fall survived without a parachute. Vesna Vulović received the Guinness prize from Paul McCartney.

A major celebrity in Yugoslavia, Vesna Vulović was a frequent guest on national television shows such as &quot;Maksovizija&quot; by Milovan Ilić Minimaks up until the 1990s. She attended annual commemorations at the crash site, until they were stopped in 2002. The daughter of the firefighter that saved her bears her name, as well as a local hotel called Pension Vesna in the Czech Republic, near the site of the crash.

<text>Juan García de Zéspedes (ca. 1619 – 5 August 1678) was a Mexican composer, singer, viol player, and teacher.

==Biography==
He is thought to have been born in Puebla, Mexico. As a boy he was a soprano in the choir at Puebla Cathedral in 1630 under Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla. In 1664 he succeeded &quot;maestro&quot; Gutiérrez in an interim capacity. The title &quot;maestro&quot; became permanent in 1670. Although censured by the cathedral chapter more than once over disagreements as to his duties, he had a long career ended by his paralysis late in life. He died in Puebla.

His musical compositions ranged from sacred pieces to secular pieces inspired by folk music.

<text>In calculus, Leibniz&#x27;s notation, named in honor of the 17th-century German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, uses the symbols and to represent infinitely small (or infinitesimal) increments of and , respectively, just as and represent finite increments of and , respectively.

Consider as a function of a variable , or = . If this is the case, then the derivative of with respect to , which later came to be viewed as the limit

:formula_1

was, according to Leibniz, the quotient of an infinitesimal increment of by an infinitesimal increment of , or

:formula_2

where the right hand side is Joseph-Louis Lagrange&#x27;s notation for the derivative of at . The infinitesimal increments are called . Related to this is the integral in which the infinitesimal increments are summed (e.g. to compute lengths, areas and volumes as sums of tiny pieces), for which Leibniz also supplied a closely related notation involving the same differentials, a notation whose efficiency proved decisive in the development of continental European mathematics.

Leibniz&#x27;s concept of infinitesimals, long considered to be too imprecise to be used as a foundation of calculus, was eventually replaced by rigorous concepts developed by Weierstrass and others in the 19th century. Consequently, Leibniz&#x27;s quotient notation was re-interpreted to stand for the limit of the modern definition. However, in many instances, the symbol did seem to act as an actual quotient would and its usefulness kept it popular even in the face of several competing notations. Several different formalisms were developed in the 20th century that can give rigorous meaning to notions of infinitesimals and infinitesimal displacements, including nonstandard analysis, tangent space, O notation and others.

The derivatives and integrals of calculus can be packaged into the modern theory of differential forms, in which the derivative is genuinely a ratio of two differentials, and the integral likewise behaves in exact accordance with Leibniz notation. However, this requires that derivative and integral first be defined by other means, and as such expresses the self-consistency and computational efficacy of the Leibniz notation rather than giving it a new foundation.

==History==

The Newton–Leibniz approach to infinitesimal calculus was introduced in the 17th century. While Newton worked with fluxions and fluents, Leibniz based his approach on generalizations of sums and differences. Leibniz adapted the integral symbol formula_3 from the initial elongated s of the Latin word &quot;umma&quot; (&quot;sum&quot;) as written at the time. Viewing differences as the inverse operation of summation, he used the symbol , the first letter of the Latin &quot;differentia&quot;, to indicate this inverse operation. Leibniz was fastidious about notation, having spent years experimenting, adjusting, rejecting and corresponding with other mathematicians about them. Notations he used for the differential of ranged successively from , , and until he finally settled on . His integral sign first appeared publicly in the article &quot;De Geometria Recondita et analysi indivisibilium atque infinitorum&quot; (&quot;On a hidden geometry and analysis of indivisibles and infinites&quot;), published in &quot;Acta Eruditorum&quot; in June 1686, but he had been using it in private manuscripts at least since 1675. Leibniz first used in the article &quot;Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis&quot;&quot; also published in &quot;Acta Eruditorum&quot; in 1684. While the symbol does appear in private manuscripts of 1675, it does not appear in this form in either of the above-mentioned published works. Leibniz did, however, use forms such as and in print.
At the end of the 19th century, Weierstrass&#x27;s followers ceased to take Leibniz&#x27;s notation for derivatives and integrals literally. That is, mathematicians felt that the concept of infinitesimals contained logical contradictions in its development. A number of 19th century mathematicians (Weierstrass and others) found logically rigorous ways to treat derivatives and integrals without infinitesimals using limits as shown above, while Cauchy exploited both infinitesimals and limits (see &quot;Cours d&#x27;Analyse&quot;). Nonetheless, Leibniz&#x27;s notation is still in general use. Although the notation need not be taken literally, it is usually simpler than alternatives when the technique of separation of variables is used in the solution of differential equations. In physical applications, one may for example regard &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) as measured in meters per second, and d&quot;x&quot; in seconds, so that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) d&quot;x&quot; is in meters, and so is the value of its definite integral. In that way the Leibniz notation is in harmony with dimensional analysis.

==Leibniz&#x27;s notation for differentiation==

Suppose a dependent variable represents a function of an independent variable , that is,

:formula_4

Then the derivative of the function , in Leibniz&#x27;s notation for differentiation, can be written as

:formula_5

The Leibniz expression, also, at times, written , is one of several notations used for derivatives and derived functions. A common alternative is Lagrange&#x27;s notation

:formula_6

Another alternative is Newton&#x27;s notation, often used for derivatives with respect to time (like velocity), which requires placing a dot over the dependent variable (in this case, ):

:formula_7

Lagrange&#x27;s &quot;prime&quot; notation is especially useful in discussions of derived functions and has the advantage of having a natural way of denoting the value of the derived function at a specific value. However, the Leibniz notation has other virtues that have kept it popular through the years.

In its modern interpretation, the expression should not be read as the division of two quantities and (as Leibniz had envisioned it); rather, the whole expression should be seen as a single symbol that is shorthand for

:formula_8

(note vs. , where indicates a finite difference).

The expression may also be thought of as the application of the differential operator (again, a single symbol) to , regarded as a function of . This operator is written in Euler&#x27;s notation. Leibniz did not use this form, but his use of the symbol corresponds fairly closely to this modern concept.

While there is traditionally no division implied by the notation (but see Nonstandard analysis), the division-like notation is useful since in many situations, the derivative operator does behave like a division, making some results about derivatives easy to obtain and remember.
This notation owes its longevity to the fact that it seems to reach to the very heart of the geometrical and mechanical applications of the calculus.

===Leibniz notation for higher derivatives===

If , the th derivative of in Leibniz notation is given by,

:formula_9

This notation, for the second derivative, is obtained by using as an operator in the following way,
:formula_10

A third derivative, which might be written as,

:formula_11

can be obtained from

:formula_12

Similarly, the higher derivatives may be obtained inductively.
While it is possible, with carefully chosen definitions, to interpret as a quotient of differentials, this should not be done with the higher order forms. However, an alternative Leibniz notation for differentiation for higher orders allows for this.

This notation was, however, not used by Leibniz. In print he did not use multi-tiered notation nor numerical exponents (before 1695). To write for instance, he would write , as was common in his time. The square of a differential, as it might appear in an arc length formula for instance, was written as . However, Leibniz did use his notation as we would today use operators, namely he would write a second derivative as and a third derivative as . In 1695 Leibniz started to write and for and respectively, but l&#x27;Hôpital, in his textbook on calculus written around the same time, used Leibniz&#x27;s original forms.

===Use in various formulas===
One reason that Leibniz&#x27;s notations in calculus have endured so long is that they permit the easy recall of the appropriate formulas used for differentiation and integration. For instance, the chain rule—suppose that the function is differentiable at and is differentiable at . Then the composite function is differentiable at and its derivative can be expressed in Leibniz notation as,
:formula_13
This can be generalized to deal with the composites of several appropriately defined and related functions, and would be expressed as,

:formula_14

Also, the integration by substitution formula may be expressed by

:formula_15

where is thought of as a function of a new variable and the function on the left is expressed in terms of while on the right it is expressed in terms of .

If where is a differentiable function that is invertible, the derivative of the inverse function, if it exists, can be given by,
:formula_16
where the parentheses are added to emphasize the fact that the derivative is not a fraction.

However, when solving differential equations, it is easy to think of the s and s as separable. One of the simplest types of differential equations is 
:formula_17
where and are continuous functions. Solving (implicitly) such an equation can be done by examining the equation in its differential form,
:formula_18
and integrating to obtain
:formula_19
Rewriting, when possible, a differential equation into this form and applying the above argument is known as the &quot;separation of variables&quot; technique for solving such equations.

In each of these instances the Leibniz notation for a derivative appears to act like a fraction, even though, in its modern interpretation, it isn&#x27;t one.

==Modern justification of infinitesimals==

In the 1960s, building upon earlier work by Edwin Hewitt and Jerzy Łoś, Abraham Robinson developed mathematical explanations for Leibniz&#x27;s infinitesimals that were acceptable by contemporary standards of rigor, and developed nonstandard analysis based on these ideas. Robinson&#x27;s methods are used by only a minority of mathematicians. Jerome Keisler wrote a first-year calculus textbook, &quot;Elementary calculus: an infinitesimal approach&quot;, based on Robinson&#x27;s approach.

From the point of view of modern infinitesimal theory, is an infinitesimal -increment, is the corresponding -increment, and the derivative is the standard part of the infinitesimal ratio:
:formula_20.
Then one sets formula_21, formula_22, so that by definition, formula_23 is the ratio of by .

Similarly, although most mathematicians now view an integral

:formula_24

as a limit

:formula_25

where is an interval containing , Leibniz viewed it as the sum (the integral sign denoted summation for him) of infinitely many infinitesimal quantities . From the viewpoint of nonstandard analysis, it is correct to view the integral as the standard part of such an infinite sum.

The trade-off needed to gain the precision of these concepts is that the set of real numbers must be extended to the set of hyperreal numbers.

==Other notations of Leibniz==

Leibniz experimented with many different notations in various areas of mathematics. He felt that good notation was fundamental in the pursuit of mathematics. In a letter to l&#x27;Hôpital in 1693 he says:
 He refined his criteria for good notation over time and came to realize the value of &quot;adopting symbolisms which could be set up in a line like ordinary type, without the need of widening the spaces between lines to make room for symbols with sprawling parts.&quot; For instance, in his early works he heavily used a vinculum to indicate grouping of symbols, but later he introduced the idea of using pairs of parentheses for this purpose, thus appeasing the typesetters who no longer had to widen the spaces between lines on a page and making the pages look more attractive.

Many of the over 200 new symbols introduced by Leibniz are still in use today. Besides the differentials , and the integral sign ( ∫ ) already mentioned, he also introduced the colon (:) for division, the middle dot (⋅) for multiplication, the geometric signs for similar (~) and congruence (≅), the use of Recorde&#x27;s equal sign (=) for proportions (replacing Oughtred&#x27;s :: notation) and the double-suffix notation for determinants.

<doc id="410720" wikidata="Q150463" url="?curid=410720" title="Brussels sprout">
<text>The Brussels sprout is a member of the Gemmifera cultivar group of cabbages (&quot;Brassica oleracea&quot;), grown for its edible buds.

==Etymology==
Though native to the Mediterranean region with other cabbage species, Brussels sprouts first appeared in northern Europe during the 5th century; they were later cultivated in the 13th century near Brussels, Belgium, from which their name derives. The group name Gemmifera (or lowercase and italicized &quot;gemmifera&quot; as a variety name) means &quot;bud-bearing&quot;.

==Description==
The leaf vegetables are typically in diameter and resemble miniature cabbages.

==Cultivation==

=== History ===
Predecessors to modern Brussels sprouts were probably cultivated in Ancient Rome. Brussels sprouts as they are now known were grown possibly as early as the 13th century in what is now Belgium. The first written reference dates to 1587. During the 16th century, they enjoyed a popularity in the southern Netherlands that eventually spread throughout the cooler parts of Northern Europe, reaching Britain by the 17th century.

Brussels sprouts grow in temperature ranges of , with highest yields at . Fields are ready for harvest 90 to 180 days after planting. The edible sprouts grow like buds in helical patterns along the side of long, thick stalks of about in height, maturing over several weeks from the lower to the upper part of the stalk. Sprouts may be picked by hand into baskets, in which case several harvests are made of five to 15 sprouts at a time, or by cutting the entire stalk at once for processing, or by mechanical harvester, depending on variety. Each stalk can produce , although the commercial yield is about per stalk. Harvest season in temperate zones of the northern latitudes is September to March, making Brussels sprouts a traditional winter-stock vegetable. In the home garden, harvest can be delayed as quality does not suffer from freezing. Sprouts are considered to be the sweetest after a frost.

Brussels sprouts are a cultivar group of the same species as broccoli, cabbage, collard greens, kale, and kohlrabi; they are cruciferous (they belong to the family Brassicaceae; old name Cruciferae). Many cultivars are available; some are purple, such as &#x27;Ruby Crunch&#x27; or &#x27;Red Bull&#x27;. The purple varieties are hybrids between purple cabbage and regular green Brussels sprouts developed by a Dutch botanist in the 1940s, yielding a variety with some of the red cabbage&#x27;s purple colors and greater sweetness.

=== Contemporary Brussels sprouts ===
In the 1990s, Dutch scientist Hans van Doorn identified the chemicals that make Brussels sprouts bitter: sinigrin and progoitrin. This enabled Dutch seed companies to cross-breed archived low-bitterness varieties with modern high-yield varieties, over time producing a significant increase in the popularity of the vegetable.

=== Europe ===
In Continental Europe, the largest producers are the Netherlands (82,000 metric tons) and Germany (10,000 tons). The United Kingdom has production comparable to that of the Netherlands, but its crop is generally not exported.

===Mexico===
Second to the Netherlands in export volume is Mexico, where the climate allows nearly year-round production. The Baja region is the main supplier to the US market, but produce also comes from the Mexicali, San Luis and coastal areas.

=== United States ===
It is unclear when Brussels sprouts were introduced to the United States, but French settlers in Louisiana are known to have grown them. The first commercial plantings began in the Louisiana delta in 1925, and much of these plantings would move to the Californian Central Coast by 1939. Currently, several thousand acres are planted in coastal areas of San Mateo, Santa Cruz, and Monterey counties of California, which offer an ideal combination of coastal fog and cool temperatures year-round. The harvest season lasts from June through January.

Most U.S. production is in California, with a smaller percentage of the crop grown in Skagit Valley, Washington, where cool springs, mild summers, and rich soil abounds, and to a lesser degree on Long Island, New York. Total US production is around 32,000 tons, with a value of $27 million.

About 80 to 85% of U.S. production is for the frozen food market, with the remainder for fresh consumption. Once harvested, sprouts last 3–5 weeks under ideal near-freezing conditions before wilting and discoloring, and about half as long at refrigerator temperature. North American varieties are generally in diameter.

==Uses==
===Nutrition===
Raw Brussels sprouts are 86% water, 9% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and negligible fat. In a 100 gram reference amount, they supply high levels (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (102% DV) and vitamin K (169% DV), with more moderate amounts of B vitamins, such as vitamin B6, as well as folate; essential minerals and dietary fiber exist in moderate to low amounts (table).

===Culinary===
The most common method of preparing Brussels sprouts for cooking begins with cutting the buds off the stalk. Any surplus stem is cut away, and any loose surface leaves are peeled and discarded. Once cut and cleaned, the buds are typically cooked by boiling, steaming, stir-frying, grilling, slow cooking, or roasting. Some cooks make a single cut or a cross in the center of the stem to aid the penetration of heat. The cross-cut may, however, be ineffective, since it is commonly believed to cause the sprouts to be waterlogged when boiled.

Overcooking renders the buds gray and soft, and they then develop a strong flavor and odor that some dislike for its garlic- or onion-odor properties. The odor is associated with the glucosinolate sinigrin, a sulfur compound having characteristic pungency. For taste, roasting Brussels sprouts is a common way to cook them to enhance flavor. Common toppings or additions include Parmesan cheese and butter, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, chestnuts, or pepper.

<doc id="410722" wikidata="Q54427" url="?curid=410722" title="Cultural hegemony">
<text>In Marxist philosophy, cultural hegemony is the dominance of a culturally diverse society by the ruling class who shape the culture of that society—the beliefs and explanations, perceptions, values, and mores—so that the worldview of the ruling class becomes the accepted cultural norm. As the universal dominant ideology, the ruling-class worldview misrepresents the social, political, and economic &quot;status quo&quot; as natural, inevitable, and perpetual social conditions that benefit every social class, rather than as artificial social constructs that benefit only the ruling class.
When the social control is carried out by another society, it is known as &quot;cultural imperialism&quot;.

In philosophy and in sociology, the denotations and the connotations of term &quot;cultural hegemony&quot; derive from the Ancient Greek word &quot;hegemonia&quot; (ἡγεμονία), which indicates the leadership and the régime of the hegemon. In political science, hegemony is the geopolitical dominance exercised by an empire, the &quot;hegemon&quot; (leader state) that rules the subordinate states of the empire by the threat of intervention, an implied means of power, rather than by threat of direct rule—military invasion, occupation, and territorial annexation.

==Background==
===Historical===
In 1848, Karl Marx proposed that the economic recessions and practical contradictions of a capitalist economy would provoke the working class to proletarian revolution, depose capitalism, restructure social institutions (economic, political, social) per the rational models of socialism, and thus begin the transition to a communist society. Therefore, the dialectical changes to the functioning of the economy of a society determine its social superstructures (culture and politics).

To that end, Antonio Gramsci proposed a &quot;strategic distinction&quot; between the politics for a War of Position and for a War of Manœuvre. The war of position is an intellectual and cultural struggle wherein the anti-capitalist revolutionary creates a proletarian culture whose native value system counters the cultural hegemony of the bourgeoisie. The proletarian culture will increase class consciousness, teach revolutionary theory and historical analysis, and thus further develop revolutionary organisation among the social classes. After winning the war of position, socialist leaders would then have the necessary political power and popular support to realise the war of manœuvre, the political praxis of revolutionary socialism.

===Political economy===
As Marxist philosophy, cultural hegemony analyses the functions of economic class within the base and superstructure, from which Gramsci developed the functions of social class within the social structures created for and by cultural domination. In the practise of imperialism, cultural hegemony occurs when the working and the peasant classes believe and accept that the prevailing cultural norms of a society (the dominant ideology imposed by the ruling class) realistically describes the natural order of things in society.

In the war for position, the working-class intelligentsia politically educate the working classes to perceive that the &quot;prevailing cultural norms&quot; are not natural and inevitable social conditions, and to recognize that the social constructs of bourgeois culture function as instruments of socio-economic domination, e.g. the institutions (state, church, and social strata), the conventions (custom and tradition), and beliefs (religions and ideologies), etc. That to realise their own working-class culture the workers and the peasants, by way of their own intellectuals, must perform the necessary analyses of their culture and national history in order for the proletariat to transcend the old ways of thinking about the order of things in a society under the cultural hegemony of an imperial power.

===Social domination===
Gramsci said that cultural and historical analyses of the &quot;natural order of things in society&quot; established by the dominant ideology, would allow common-sense men and women to intellectually perceive the social structures of bourgeois cultural hegemony. In each sphere of life (private and public) common sense is the intellectualism with which people cope with and explain their daily life within their social stratum within the greater social order; yet the limits of common sense inhibit a person&#x27;s intellectual perception of the exploitation of labour made possible with cultural hegemony. Given the difficulty in perceiving the &quot;status quo&quot; hierarchy of bourgeois culture (social and economic classes), most people concern themselves with private matters, and so do not question the fundamental sources of their socio-economic oppression, individual and collective.

==Intelligentsia==
To perceive and combat ruling-class cultural hegemony, the working class and the peasant class depend upon the moral and political leadership of their native intelligentsia, the scholars, academics, and teachers, scientists, philosophers, administrators &quot;et al.&quot; from their specific social classes; thus Gramsci&#x27;s political distinction between the intellectuals of the bourgeoisie and the intellectuals of the working class, respectively, the men and women who are the proponents and the opponents of the cultural &quot;status quo&quot;:

==After Gramsci==
===German student movement===
In 1967, regarding the politics and society of West Germany, the leader of the German Student Movement, Rudi Dutschke, applied Gramsci&#x27;s analyses of cultural hegemony using the phrase the &quot;Long March through the Institutions&quot; to describe the ideological work necessary to realise the war of position. The allusion to the Long March (1934–35) of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army indicates the great work required of the working-class intelligentsia to produce the working-class popular culture with which to replace the dominant ideology imposed by the cultural hegemony of the bourgeoisie.

===State apparatuses of ideology===
In Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (1970), Louis Althusser describes the complex of social relationships among the different organs of the State that transmit and disseminate the dominant ideology to the populations of a society. The ideological state apparatuses (ISA) are the sites of ideological conflict among the social classes of a society; and, unlike the military and police forces, the repressive state apparatuses (RSA), the ISA exist as a plurality throughout society.

Despite the ruling-class control of the RSA, the ideological apparatuses of the state are both the sites and the stakes (the objects) of class struggle, because the ISA are not monolithic social entities, and exist amongst society. As the public and the private sites of continual class struggle, the ideological apparatuses of the state (ISA) are overdetermined zones of society that are composed of elements of the dominant ideologies of previous modes of production, hence the continual political activity in:

* the religious ISA (the clergy)
* the educational ISA (the public and private school systems)
* the family ISA (patriarchal family)
* the legal ISA (police and legal, court and penal systems)
* the political ISA (political parties)
* the company union ISA
* the mass communications ISA (print, radio, television, internet, cinema)
* the cultural ISA (literature, the arts, sport, etc.)

The parliamentary structures of the State, by which elected politicians exercise &quot;the will of the people&quot; also are an ideological apparatus of the State, given the State&#x27;s control of which populations are allowed to participate as political parties. In itself, the political system is an ideological apparatus, because citizens&#x27; participation involves intellectually accepting the ideological &quot;fiction, corresponding to a &#x27;certain&#x27; reality, that the component parts of the [political] system, as well as the principle of its functioning, are based on the ideology of the &#x27;freedom&#x27; and &#x27;equality&#x27; of the individual voters and the &#x27;free choice&#x27; of the people&#x27;s representatives, by the individuals that &#x27;make up&#x27; the people&quot;.

<text>The Welsh Guards (WLSH GDS; ), part of the Guards Division, is one of the Foot Guards regiments of the British Army. It was founded in 1915 as a single-battalion regiment, during the First World War, by Royal Warrant of George V. Shortly after the regiment&#x27;s formation, it was deployed to France where it took part in the fighting on the Western Front until the end of the war in November 1918. During the inter-war years, the regiment undertook garrison duties in the United Kingdom, except between 1929 and 1930 when it deployed to Egypt, and late 1939 when it deployed to Gibraltar.

The regiment was expanded to three battalions during the Second World War, and served in France, North Africa, Tunisia, Italy and Western Europe. In the post war period, the regiment was reduced to a single battalion and saw service in Palestine, Egypt, West Germany, Aden, Northern Ireland, and Cyprus. In 1982, the regiment took part in the Falklands War. In the 21st century, the regiment has deployed as peacekeepers to Bosnia, and on operations to both Iraq and Afghanistan.

==History==
===Creation and First World War service===
The Welsh Guards came into existence on 26 February 1915 by Royal Warrant of George V in order to include Wales in the national component to the Foot Guards, &quot;..though the order to raise the regiment had been given by the King to Earl Kitchener, Secretary of State for War, on 26 February 1915.&quot; They were the last of the Guards to be created, with the Irish Guards coming into being in 1900. Just three days later, the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards mounted its first King&#x27;s Guard at Buckingham Palace on 1 March 1915 – St David&#x27;s Day.

On 17 August 1915, the 1st Battalion sailed for France to join the Guards Division to commence its participation in the First World War. Its first battle was some months after its initial arrival, at Loos on 27 September 1915. The regiment&#x27;s first Victoria Cross came two years later in July 1917 awarded to Sergeant Robert Bye.

===Inter-war years===
Soon after the end of the war in 1918 1st Battalion, Welsh Guards returned home and where they would be based for much of the inter-war period, performing training and ceremonial duties, such as the Changing of the Guard and Trooping the Colour. In 1929, 1st Welsh Guards deployed to Egypt where they joined the Cairo Brigade where they stayed for only a brief period of time, returning home in 1930. Just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, 1st Welsh Guards were dispatched to Gibraltar where they remained upon the outbreak of war in September 1939. The 2nd Battalion, Welsh Guards was created in 1939.

===Second World War===
The Welsh Guards were increased to three battalions during the Second World War. The 1st Battalion fought valiantly in all the campaigns of the North-West European Theatre. The 2nd Battalion, part of the 20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards), fought briefly in Boulogne, France, in late May 1940 whilst the 1st fought in the battles of Belgium and France as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) GHQ Troops. In May 1940 at the Battle of Arras, the Welsh Guards gained their second Victoria Cross by Lieutenant Christopher Furness, who was subsequently killed in action. The 1st Battalion was subsequently part of the retreat to Dunkirk, where they were involved in the legendary Dunkirk evacuation that saw nearly 340,000 Allied troops return to the United Kingdom, against all odds.

The 3rd Battalion, Welsh Guards, which was formed at Beavers Lane Camp in 1941, fought throughout the arduous North African Campaign, in the Tunisia Campaign and the Italian campaigns in 1943.

While they battled on in those theatres the 1st and 2nd joined the Guards Armoured Division, with the 1st Battalion being infantry, assigned to the 32nd Guards Brigade, and the 2nd Battalion being armoured, part of the 6th Guards Armoured Brigade. The two battalions worked closely, being the first troops to re-enter Brussels on 3 September 1944 after an advance of 100 miles in one day in what was described as &#x27;an armoured lash unequalled for speed in this or any other war&#x27; led by Major-General Sir Allan Henry Adair, the divisional commander.

===Postwar===

Shortly after the end of the war the 3rd Battalion was disbanded while the 2nd Battalion was placed in suspended animation. In 1947 the 1st Welsh Guards were dispatched to Palestine, then under British control, while it was in a volatile and violent situation. The Welsh Guards were part of the 1st Guards Brigade and performed internal security (IS) duties while there, before leaving in 1948 during the British withdrawal and when the state of Israel was declared. The regiment had its colour trooped for the first time in 1949.

In 1950, the regiment arrived in West Germany as part of the 4th Guards Brigade, part of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). In 1952 the regiment joined the Area Troops Berlin in West Berlin, an enclave in Communist East Germany during tense times between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact. The Welsh Guards returned home the following year and soon after deployed to the British-controlled Suez Canal Zone (SEZ) in Egypt. As previously in Palestine, the Welsh Guards&#x27; time in Egypt was quite turbulent. They performed internal security duties there, remaining in the SEZ until the British withdrawal in 1956.

In 1960, the regiment deployed to West Germany again, and in 1965 to Aden, another part of the declining British Empire. They returned home the following year. In 1970 the regiment arrived again in West Germany, this time at Münster, as part of 4th Armoured Brigade.

In 1972, came deployment to Northern Ireland, then embroiled in violence later known as &quot;The Troubles&quot;. During its tour of duty the regiment lost Sergeant Phillip Price in a terrorist attack by the Provisional Irish Republican Army on the Oxford Street Bus Depot in Belfast, one of a series of terrorist attacks in the city which became known as &quot;Bloody Friday&quot;. The following year the Welsh Guards were dispatched to the province again, and during this period lost Guardsman David Roberts in a landmine explosion.

Between October 1975 and March 1976 the Welsh Guards were part of the British contingent of the United Nations force deployed to Cyprus in the aftermath of the Turkish invasion of the island in 1974. In 1977 the regiment arrived in West Berlin again, and then in 1979 once more in the midst of the volatile situation in Northern Ireland, they lost Guardsman Paul Fryer to a booby-trap bomb. On 9 July 1981, Daniel Barrett, aged 15 years, was sitting on the garden wall of his home in Havana Court, Ardoyne, North Belfast, when he was shot dead by a soldier from the Welsh Guards.

===Falklands War===
In 1982, the Welsh Guards (CO Lieutenant-Colonel John Rickett) formed part of the 5th Infantry Brigade of the British Task Force sent to liberate the Falkland Islands from Argentinian occupation during the Falklands War. On 8 June they were on board the ill-fated &quot;Sir Galahad&quot;, which was accompanied by &quot;Sir Tristram&quot;, waiting to be landed at Bluff Cove though they were delayed from doing so. However, attack was imminent after the landing craft were spotted by Argentinian observers. At 2:00 am, five Dagger and five A-4 Skyhawk aircraft were seen over the Falklands. Shortly afterwards, the Daggers were the first to attack. Only a short time later, the Skyhawks reached Fitzroy, with three of the aircraft hitting the &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; two or more times with horrific consequences. &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; was also hit which killed two crewmen, both ships were ablaze. The attack on &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; culminated in high casualties, 48 dead, 32 of them Welsh Guards, 11 other Army personnel and five crewmen from &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; herself. There were many wounded, many suffering from horrendous burns caused by fire from the burning ships, the best known being Simon Weston. The burnt-out &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; was later scuttled at sea to allow her to become a war grave. On 13-14 June, the remainder of the battalion, reinforced by two companies of Royal Marines from 40 Commando, were given the objective of capturing Sapper Hill in the final stages of the Battle of Mount Tumbledown. Following a firefight at their helicopter landing zone, the force moved on to Sapper Hill but found it abandoned, thus taking the last defensible position before Stanley.

===Since 1984===

In 1984, the Welsh Guards arrived in Hohne, West Germany as part of the 22nd Armoured Brigade and two years later arrived in Northern Ireland for another tour-of-duty before returning to Germany. The regiment returned home to Elizabeth Barracks, Pirbright in 1988. In 1989 The Welsh Guards conducted a six-month operational roulement Battalion tour of Belize from April to October 1989 and in 1992 arrived in Northern Ireland for a two-year deployment as part of 8th Infantry Brigade. During their tour of Northern Ireland the BBC filmed the documentary &quot;In the Company of Men&quot; by Molly Dineen, which filmed a deployment to the heavily nationalist County Fermanagh during the regiment&#x27;s tour.

On 6 September 1997, 12 Guardsmen of the Welsh Guards led by the adjutant of the 1st Battalion, &quot;The Prince of Wales&quot; Company, Captain Richard Williams MC, hero in 1993 of the Khmer Rouge incident in which he was captured defending civilians in Cambodia, were pulled from security patrols in South Armagh, Northern Ireland and together with members of the King&#x27;s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery escorted the casket of Diana, Princess of Wales, from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey.

In 2002, the regiment arrived in Bosnia as part of SFOR, a NATO-led force intended to ensure peace and stability in the Balkan nation. During their deployment the Queen Mother died. A number of officers of the Welsh Guards stood in vigil around the Queen Mother&#x27;s coffin which was lying in state in Westminster Hall, one of a number of regiments to do so. The regiment returned home from its deployment to Bosnia later in the year. It was involved in Operation Fresco, the British armed forces response to the firefighters strike; the Welsh Guards covered the Midlands area, primarily in Birmingham using the antiquated Army &quot;Green Goddess&quot; fire engines.

In 2003, the Welsh Guards moved from Aldershot to RAF St Athan, Wales.

In 2005, the Welsh Guards were part of Operation Telic and were based in Basra, Southern Iraq. Here they used relationship-building skills learnt from their time in Bosnia to build a bond between the regiment and local people.

In 2006, the regiment returned to London as a public duties battalion. It will alternate this role with the Grenadier Guards. The regiment deployed to Bosnia in October 2006, replacing the 2nd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment. In November 2007, the regiment deployed to Belize at short notice to take part in jungle warfare training; they returned just before Christmas.

In 2008, the Welsh Guards moved from London to Lille Barracks in Aldershot, in preparation for deployment on Operation Herrick 10 in Afghanistan. The regiment departed in April 2009. Six members of the battalion were killed, among them a platoon commander, a company commander and the battalion commander. It was the first time since the Korean War that a single battalion had lost officers at these three key levels of leadership. The six-month tour was chronicled in the book &quot;Dead Men Risen; the Welsh Guards and the Defining Story of Britain&#x27;s War in Afghanistan&quot; by Toby Harnden, which won the Orwell Prize for Books 2012.

On 1 July 2009, Lieutenant-Colonel Rupert Thorneloe MBE was killed along with Trooper Joshua Hammond of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, following the detonation of an IED in Afghanistan under their BvS 10 Viking during Operation Panther&#x27;s Claw. Lieutenant-Colonel Thorneloe was the highest ranking British Army officer killed since Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert &quot;H&quot; Jones, VC OBE, in the Falkland Islands.

As a result of the Army 2020 Refine reforms, the battalion moved to Combermere Barracks which was the former home to the armoured regiment of the Household Cavalry.

There are two museums with artefacts and memorabilia about the regiment. The Welsh Guards Museum is in Oswestry, Shropshire. The Guards Museum, in Wellington Barracks, London, is home of the five regiments of Foot Guards (the Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards, Scots Guards, Irish Guards, and Welsh Guards).

==Training==

Recruits to the Guards Division go through a grueling training programme at the Infantry Training Centre (ITC). The training is two weeks more than the training for the Regular line infantry regiments of the British Army; the extra training, carried out throughout the course, is devoted to drill and ceremonies.

==Colonels-in-Chief==
King George V assumed the colonelcy-in-chief of the regiment on its formation, and subsequent monarchs have also been colonel-in-chief.

==Traditions and affiliations==

The Welsh Guards and other Guards regiments have a long-standing connection to The Parachute Regiment. Guardsman who have completed P company are transferred into the Guards Parachute Platoon which is currently attached to 3 PARA, maintaining a tradition of the No 1 (Guards) Independent Parachute Company—the original Pathfinder Group of the 16th Parachute Brigade, now renamed the 16th Air Assault Brigade.

The 3rd Battalion the Royal Welsh from the Army Reserve is paired with 1st Battalion Welsh Guards and will deploy on future Operations with them.

One way to distinguish between the regiments of Foot Guards is the spacing of buttons on the tunic. The Welsh Guards, the fifth regiment in seniority, have buttons arranged in groups of five. The other distinctive feature of their uniform is the presence of a white, green and white plume (hackle), worn on the left side of the bearskin.

In 1810, the British Army introduced metal rank insignia for field officers (majors and colonels) and generals. This was an arrangement of Stars and Crowns. The &quot;Star&quot; (nicknamed a &quot;pip&quot; in line regiments) was actually a raised diamond shape similar to the Knight Grand Cross star of the Order of the Garter. In 1855 metal insignia was introduced for subaltern officers (lieutenants and captains) and the star was changed to that of the Order of the Bath. In 1855 the Grenadier Guards and Coldstream Guards were granted Order of the Garter stars and the Scots-Fusilier Guards received Order of the Thistle stars for their service in the Crimean War. In 1919 the Irish Guards and Welsh Guards, the two newest regiments of the Brigade of Guards, received distinctive stars of their own for their service in World War One. The Irish Guards were granted the Order of St Patrick and the Welsh Guards were granted the Order of the Garter.

<doc id="410742" wikidata="Q186418" url="?curid=410742" title="Kunduz Province">
<text>Kunduz () is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the northern part of the country next to Tajikistan. The population of the province is around 1,136,677, which is mostly a tribal society; it is one of Afghanistan&#x27;s most ethnically diverse provinces with many different ethnicities in large numbers living there. The city of Kunduz serves as the capital of the province. It borders the provinces of Takhar, Baghlan, Samangan and Balkh, as well as the Khatlon Region of Tajikistan. The Kunduz Airport is located next to the provincial capital.

The Kunduz River valley dominates the Kunduz Province. The river flows irregularly from south to north into the Amu Darya river which forms the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan. A newly constructed bridge crosses the Amu Darya at Sherkhan Bandar and the international trade is a large source of Kunduz&#x27;s economy. The river, its tributaries, and derivative canals provide irrigation to the irrigated fields that dominate land usage in the agricultural province. There are also rain-fed fields and open range land that span several miles. Kunduz was once a major economic center for Afghanistan, but the wars since 1978 have changed fortunes for the province. Initially during the War in Afghanistan (2001-2021), Kunduz was one of the more stable regions of Afghanistan, but during the 2010s quickly turned into one of the most unstable provinces of the country, resulting in large parts falling under Taliban insurgent control. In 2021, the Taliban gained control of the province during their nationwide summer offensive.

==History==
The area has been part of many empires in the past. It became part of the Afghan Durrani Empire in the mid-18th century. It saw a major migration from Russian Turkestan in the north during the early 1920s. During the governance of Sher Khan Nasher, Kunduz became one of the wealthiest of Afghanistan&#x27;s provinces, mainly due to Nasher&#x27;s founding of the Spinzar Cotton Company, which continues to exist in post-war Afghanistan in the early 20th century.

Between 100,000 and 200,000 Tajiks and Uzbeks fled the conquest of their homeland by Russian Red Army and settled in northern Afghanistan.

The province witnessed much violence and fighting during the Soviet–Afghan War.
During the war in Afghanistan Kunduz was captured by NATO forces. In November 2001, members of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, along with Pakistani military personnel and Afghan sympathizers were airlifted to Pakistan to evade NATO capture in the Kunduz Airlift.
Germany had 4,000 soldiers stationed in the NATO-ISAF Kunduz province Provincial Reconstruction Team, along with Regional Command North. The province was largely peaceful until Taliban militants started infiltrating the area in 2009.

On 4 September 2009, the German commander called in an American jet fighter, which attacked two NATO fuel trucks, which had been captured by insurgents. More than 90 people died, among them at least 40 civilians, who had gathered to collect fuel.
It was reported that on 21 November 2009, a bomb going off along the Takhar Kunduz highway killed a child and injured two others.

The governor, Mohammad Omar, was killed by a bomb on 8 October 2010.

On 10 February 2011, a suicide bomber killed a district governor and six other people in the district of Chardara in Kunduz Province, where the insurgency is well entrenched.

As part of the Taliban&#x27;s resurgence in northern Afghanistan, Kunduz has been increasingly affected by war and instability. The Taliban after their ouster did not gain a foothold in Kunduz Province until 2009, but since then their influence expanded and they eventually captured the capital city of Kunduz briefly in 2015 and 2016. As of 2021, many parts are under Taliban control. Since the mid-2010s and in 2021 many residents have been forced to flee the province to places like Kabul or across the border to Tajikistan.

On 8 August 2021, the Taliban regained control of Kunduz City according to local sources.

==Transportation==
The province is served by Kunduz Airport which had regularly scheduled direct flights to Kabul as of May 2014. The Tajikistan–Afghanistan bridge at Panji Poyon connects the province to Tajikistan.

==Economy==
Agriculture and livestock husbandry are the primary occupations of the provinces residents. Fruit and vegetable are the most commonly farms items but there is also some cotton and sesame production. Farmers faced water shortages.

Men and women in Kunduz were employed in clothing production, metal working, carpentry and hide business.

The port of Sherkhan Bandar provides an international outlet for Kunduz&#x27;s goods and has allowed for importing commercial goods from Asia, Middle East, and the Persian Gulf.

Cotton production is the province&#x27;s most important industry. Agriculture is a significant source of income for 66 percent of households in the province, including 34 percent of urban households. However, commerce and services provide income to 28% of households, and non-farm work provides income to 15% of households. To some extent, Kunduz produces industrial crops. Sesame is another important product, in addition to cotton. The province&#x27;s small-business sector is essentially non-existent, and karakul skin is the main product. Handicrafts aren&#x27;t made in significant quantities, but rugs and jewelry are made to some extent. In the province, 85 percent of households have access to irrigated land, while 12 percent have access to irrigated land. Wheat, rice, watermelons, melons, and maize are among the province&#x27;s most important field crops. Sheep, cattle, poultry, donkeys, and goats are the most frequent livestock.

==Healthcare==
The percentage of households with clean drinking water fell from 25% in 2005 to 16% in 2011. 
The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant increased from 6% in 2005 to 22% in 2011.

==Infrastructure ==
Only 25% of families have access to safe drinking water, and only 18% of houses have access to electricity, with the bulk relying on public power. Safe toilets are found in only 2% of urban households, while they are almost non-existent in rural regions. The province&#x27;s transportation infrastructure is fairly well developed, with 68 percent of roads capable of carrying car traffic in all seasons. However, there are no roads in 4% of the province. In terms of telecommunications, the Roshan (telco), Afghan Wireless, and MTN Digital phone networks are all operational in the province.

==Education==
The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) fell from 33% in 2005 to 20% in 2011. 
The overall net enrolment rate (6–13 years of age) fell from 62% in 2005 to 50% in 2011.

==Demographics==

Although a reliable census has not been carried out, as of 2020 the population of Kunduz province is estimated to be around 1,136,677 people. The province is mostly rural and very ethnically diverse of Afghanistan&#x27;s provinces. According to the Naval Postgraduate School, the ethnic groups of the province are as follows: Pashtuns 33%, Uzbeks 27%, Tajiks 22%, Turkmens 11%, Hazaras 6%, and Pashais 1%.

About 94% of the population practice Sunni Islam and 6% are followers of Shia Islam. The major languages spoken in the area are Pashto, Dari Persian, and Uzbeki.

An estimated 49.3% of the population is female, with the other 50.7% being male.

<doc id="410746" wikidata="Q620639" url="?curid=410746" title="Dysautonomia">
<text>Dysautonomia, autonomic failure, or autonomic dysfunction is a condition in which the autonomic nervous system (ANS) does not work properly. This condition may affect the functioning of the heart, bladder, intestines, sweat glands, pupils, and blood vessels. Dysautonomia has many causes, not all of which may be classified as neuropathic. A number of conditions can feature dysautonomia, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, multiple system atrophy, dementia with Lewy bodies, Ehlers–Danlos syndromes, autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy and autonomic neuropathy, HIV/AIDS, mitochondrial cytopathy, pure autonomic failure, autism, and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.

Diagnosis is made by functional testing of the ANS, focusing on the affected organ system. Investigations may be performed to identify underlying disease processes that may have led to the development of symptoms or autonomic neuropathy. Symptomatic treatment is available for many symptoms associated with dysautonomia, and some disease processes can be directly treated. Depending on the severity of the dysfunction, dysautonomia can range from being nearly symptomless and transient to disabling and/or life-threatening.

==Signs and symptoms==
Dysautonomia, a complex set of conditions characterized by autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction, manifests clinically with a diverse array of symptoms of which postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) stands out as the most common. 

The symptoms of dysautonomia, which are numerous and vary widely for each person, are due to inefficient or unbalanced efferent signals sent via both systems. Symptoms in people with dysautonomia include:

* Anhydrosis or hyperhidrosis
* Blurry or double vision
* Bowel incontinence
* Brain fog
* Constipation
* Dizziness
* Difficulty swallowing
* Exercise intolerance
* Low blood pressure
* Orthostatic hypotension
* Syncope
* Tachycardia
* Tunnel vision
* Urinary incontinence or urinary retention
* Sleep apnea
==Causes==

Dysautonomia may be due to inherited or degenerative neurologic diseases (primary dysautonomia) or injury of the autonomic nervous system from an acquired disorder (secondary dysautonomia). Its most common causes include:

In the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), predominant dysautonomia is common along with fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and interstitial cystitis, raising the possibility that such dysautonomia could be their common clustering underlying pathogenesis.

In addition to sometimes being a symptom of dysautonomia, anxiety can sometimes physically manifest symptoms resembling autonomic dysfunction. A thorough investigation ruling out physiological causes is crucial, but in cases where relevant tests are performed and no causes are found or symptoms do not match any known disorders, a primary anxiety disorder is possible but should not be presumed. For such patients, the anxiety sensitivity index may have better predictivity for anxiety disorders while the Beck Anxiety Inventory may misleadingly suggest anxiety for patients with dysautonomia.

Mitochondrial cytopathies can have autonomic dysfunction manifesting as orthostatic intolerance, sleep-related hypoventilation, and arrhythmias.

==Mechanism==
The autonomic nervous system is a component of the peripheral nervous system and comprises two branches: the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS). The SNS controls the more active responses, such as increasing heart rate and blood pressure. The PSNS, for example, slows down the heart rate and aids digestion. Symptoms typically arise from abnormal responses of either the sympathetic or parasympathetic systems based on situation or environment.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of dysautonomia depends on the overall function of three autonomic functions—cardiovagal, adrenergic, and sudomotor. A diagnosis should at a minimum include measurements of blood pressure and heart rate while lying flat and after at least three minutes of standing. The best way to make a diagnosis includes a range of testing, notably an autonomic reflex screen, tilt table test, and testing of the sudomotor response (ESC, QSART or thermoregulatory sweat test).

Additional tests and examinations to diagnose dysautonomia include:

Tests to elucidate the cause of dysautonomia can include:
* Evaluation for acute (intermittent) porphyria
* Evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture for infectious/ inflammatory diseases

===Vegetative-vascular dystonia===
Particularly in the Russian literature, a subtype of dysautonomia that particularly affects the vascular system has been called vegetative-vascular dystonia. The term &quot;vegetative&quot; reflects an older name for the autonomic nervous system: the vegetative nervous system.

A similar form of this disorder has been historically noticed in various wars, including the Crimean War and American Civil War, and among British troops who colonized India. This disorder was called &quot;irritable heart syndrome&quot; (Da Costa&#x27;s syndrome) in 1871 by American physician Jacob DaCosta.

==Management==

Treatment of dysautonomia can be difficult; since it is made up of many different symptoms, a combination of drug therapies is often required to manage individual symptomatic complaints. In the case of autoimmune neuropathy, treatment with immunomodulatory therapies is done. If diabetes mellitus is the cause, control of blood glucose is important. Treatment can include proton-pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists used for digestive symptoms such as acid reflux.

To treat genitourinary autonomic neuropathy, medications may include sildenafil (a guanine monophosphate type-5 phosphodiesterase inhibitor). To treat hyperhidrosis, anticholinergic agents such as trihexyphenidyl or scopolamine can be used. Intracutaneous injection of botulinum toxin type A can also be used in some cases.

Balloon angioplasty, a procedure called transvascular autonomic modulation, is specifically not approved in the United States to treat autonomic dysfunction.

In contrast to orthostatic hypotension (OH) that may be caused by underlying neurodegenerative diseases, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) that may be caused by underlying psychiatric diseases responds to psychiatric intervention/medication or shows spontaneous remission. 
==Prognosis==
The prognosis of dysautonomia depends on several factors; people with chronic, progressive, generalized dysautonomia in the setting of central nervous system degeneration such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease or multiple system atrophy generally have poorer long-term prognoses. Dysautonomia can be fatal due to pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, or sudden cardiopulmonary arrest. Autonomic dysfunction symptoms such as orthostatic hypotension, gastroparesis, and gustatory sweating are more frequently identified in mortalities.

<text>This is a list of [[calendar]]s. Included are historical calendars as well as proposed ones. Historical calendars are often grouped into larger categories by cultural sphere or historical period; thus O&#x27;Neil (1976) distinguishes the groupings Egyptian calendars (Ancient Egypt), Babylonian calendars (Ancient Mesopotamia), Indian calendars (Hindu and Buddhist traditions of the Indian subcontinent), Chinese calendars and Mesoamerican calendars. These are not specific calendars but series of historical calendars undergoing reforms or regional diversification.

In Classical Antiquity, the Hellenic calendars inspired the Roman calendar, including the solar Julian calendar introduced in 45 BC. Many modern calendar proposals, including the Gregorian calendar introduced in 1582 AD, contains modifications from that of the Julian calendar.

==List of calendars==
In the list below, specific calendars are given, listed by calendar type (solar, lunisolar or lunar), time of introduction (if known), and the context of use and cultural or historical grouping (if applicable). Where appropriate, the regional or historical group (Jewish calendar, Hijri calendar, Sikh, Mayan, Aztecan, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Iranian, Hindu, Buddhist, Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican, Hellenic, Julian or Gregorian-derived) is noted.

Calendars fall into four types: lunisolar, solar, lunar and seasonal. Most pre-modern calendars are lunisolar. The seasonal calendars rely on changes in the environment (e.g., &quot;wet season&quot;, &quot;dry season&quot;) rather than lunar or solar observations. The Islamic and some Buddhist calendars are lunar, while most modern calendars are solar, based on either the Julian or the Gregorian calendars.

Some calendars listed are identical to the Gregorian calendar except for substituting regional month names or using a different calendar epoch. For example, the Thai solar calendar (introduced 1888) is the Gregorian calendar using a different epoch (543 BC) and different names for the Gregorian months (Thai names based on the signs of the zodiac).


==Variant month names==
Regional or historical names for lunations or Julian/Gregorian months

==Non-standard weeks==


==Calendaring and timekeeping standards==
* Coordinated Universal Time, adopted 1960 and since 1972 including a system of observation-based leap seconds.
* ISO 8601, standard based on the Gregorian calendar, Coordinated Universal Time and ISO week date, a leap week calendar system used with the Gregorian calendar
* Fiscal year varies with different countries. Used in accounting only.
* 360-day calendar used for accounting
* 365-day calendar used for accounting
* Unix time, number of seconds elapsed since 1 January 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC).
* Julian day, number of days elapsed since 1 January 4713 BC, 12:00:00 (UTC).
* Heliocentric Julian Date, Julian day corrected for differences in the Earth&#x27;s position with respect to the Sun.
* Barycentric Julian Date, Julian day corrected for differences in the Earth&#x27;s position with respect to the barycentre of the Solar System.
* Lilian date, number of days elapsed since the beginning of the Gregorian Calendar on 15 October 1582.
* Rata Die, number of days elapsed since 1 January 1 AD 1 in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.

==Non-Earth or fictional==

* Darian calendar (proposed for Mars, not used in planetary science)
* Discworld calendar (fictional)
* Middle-earth calendars (fictional)
* Stardates (from Star Trek, fictional)

<doc id="410766" wikidata="Q1123131" url="?curid=410766" title="Disputation">
<text>Disputation is a genre of literature involving two contenders who seek to establish a resolution to a problem or establish the superiority of something. An example of the latter is in Sumerian disputation poems.

In the scholastic system of education of the Middle Ages, disputations (in Latin: &quot;disputationes&quot;, singular: &quot;disputatio&quot;) offered a formalized method of debate designed to uncover and establish truths in theology and in sciences. Fixed rules governed the process: they demanded dependence on traditional written authorities and the thorough understanding of each argument on each side.

== Mesopotamian disputations ==

In the ancient Near East, disputation was a popular genre of literature that went back at least to the mid-3rd millennium BC with the onset of Sumerian disputations, followed by the first Akkadian-language disputations which began in the 18th century BC. Sumerian and Akkadian language disputations had some discontinuity, insofar as different topics were discussed, different literary conventions were used, and none of the later Akkadian disputations appear to be translations of earlier Sumerian disputations. The two most well-attested Sumerian disputations are the &quot;Debate between the hoe and the plough&quot; and the &quot;Debate between sheep and grain&quot;.

== Syriac disputations ==
Many disputations were composed in the Syriac language, including the &quot;Dispute Between the Cherub and the Thief&quot; and the &quot;Dispute Between Heaven and Earth&quot;.

==Medieval disputations==
A significant category of disputations took place between Christian and Jewish theologians as a form of both theological and philosophical debate and proselytization. Often, the Christian side was represented by a recent convert from Judaism. The only way for the Jewish side to &#x27;win&#x27; was to force a draw by drawing the Christian side into a position in which it was necessary to deny the Old Testament to win, committing heresy. According to Michael J. Cook, &quot;Since &#x27;winning&#x27; a debate could well jeopardize the security of the Jewish community at large, political considerations certainly entered into what Jewish disputants publicly said or refrained from saying. ... Official transcripts of these proceedings, moreover, may not duplicate what actually transpired; in some places what they record was not the live action, as it were, but Christian polemical revision composed after the fact.&quot;

* 1240: the Disputation of Paris during the reign of Louis IX of France (St. Louis) between a member of the Franciscan Order Nicholas Donin, who earlier converted from Judaism and persuaded Pope Gregory IX to issue a bill ordering the burning of the Talmud, and four of the most distinguished rabbis of France: Yechiel of Paris, Moses of Coucy, Judah of Melun, and Samuel ben Solomon of Château-Thierry. The commission of Christian theologians condemned the Talmud to be burned and on June 17, 1244, twenty-four carriage loads of Jewish religious manuscripts were set on fire in the streets of Paris.
* 1263: the Disputation of Barcelona before King James I of Aragon: between the friar Pablo Christiani (a convert from Judaism) and Rabbi Moses ben Nachman (also known as Nachmanides). At the end of disputation, the king awarded Nachmanides a monetary prize and declared that never before had he heard &quot;an unjust cause so nobly defended.&quot; Nevertheless, the Dominicans claimed the victory and Nachmanides was exiled and his report of the proceedings was condemned and burned. A committee appointed by the king censored the passages from the Talmud they deemed offensive.
* 1375: public disputations held at Burgos and Avila by Moses Cohen de Tordesillas with converts from Judaism John of Valladolid and Abner of Burgos. Another disputation was held at about the same time in Pamplona by Shem-Tob ben Isaac Shaprut of Tudela with Cardinal Don Pedro de Luna, afterward Avignon Pope Benedict XIII, the disputations being made the subjects of the books &quot;&#x27;Ezer ha-Emunah&quot; (by Moses) and &quot;Eben Boḥan&quot;.
* 1413: the Disputation of Tortosa in Spain, staged by the Antipope Benedict XIII. As a result, the Pope gave instructions by which all books of the Talmud would be handed over to his functionaries for censorship.
Some disputations also appeared in the Islamic world, including one between a pen and a sword, attributed to Ahmad Ibn Burd al-Asghar in the 11th century.

==Emergence of Protestantism (1518–1550)==

Martin Luther opened the Protestant Reformation by demanding a disputation upon his 95 theses, 31 October 1517. Although presented as a call to an ordinary scholastic dispute, there is no evidence that such an event ever took place.

===Heidelberg Disputation (1518)===

During a convention held at Heidelberg in April 1518, Luther directed a dispute on 28 theological and 12 philosophical theses. He was successful in winning over Johannes Brenz and the Dominican Martin Bucer.

===Leipzig Disputation (1519)===

Johann Eck became involved in a literary contest with Andreas Karlstadt and challenged his adversary to a public debate. In Leipzig, although the faculty of the university entered a protest, and the Bishops of Merseburg and Brandenburg launched prohibitions and an excommunication, the disputation took place under the ægis of Duke George of Saxony. Eck came to Leipzig with one attendant; Luther and Karlstadt entered the city accompanied by an army of adherents, mostly students. From 27 June to 4 July (1519) Eck and Karlstadt debated the subject of free will and our ability to cooperate with grace. Eck forced his antagonist to make admissions which stultified the new Lutheran doctrine, whereupon Luther himself came forward to assail the dogma of Roman supremacy by divine right. The debate on papal primacy was succeeded by discussions of purgatory, indulgences, penance, etc. On 14 and 15 July, Karlstadt resumed the debate on free will and good works. Finally, Duke George declared the disputation closed, and each of the contendents departed, as usual, claiming victory.

Of the two universities to which the final decision had been reserved, the University of Erfurt declined to intervene and returned the documents; the University of Paris sat in judgment upon Luther&#x27;s writings, attaching to each of his opinions theological censure. Luther gained the support of Melanchthon.

The Leipzig Disputation was the last occasion on which the ancient custom of swearing to advance no tenet contrary to Catholic doctrine was observed. In all subsequent debates between Catholics and Protestants, the bare text of Holy Writ was taken as the authority. This placed the Catholics in a disadvantageous position. This was particularly the case in Switzerland, where Zwingli and his lieutenants organized a number of one-sided debates under the presidency of town councils already won over to Protestantism. Such were the disputations of Zurich, 1523, of Swiss Baden, 1526, and of Berne, 1528. In all of these the result was the abolition of Catholic worship and in their opinion the desecration of churches and religious institutions.

===Diet of Regensburg (1541)===
Emperor Charles V attempted to bring the religious troubles of Germany to a &quot;speedy and peaceful termination&quot; by conferences between the Catholic and the Protestant divines. The Protestants proclaimed their determination to adhere to the terms of the Augsburg Confession, and, in addition, formally repudiated the authority of the Roman pontiff and &quot;would admit no other judge of the controversy than Jesus Christ&quot;; both Pope Paul III and Luther predicted failure. However, since the emperor and his brother, King Ferdinand, persisted in making a trial, the pope authorized his nuncio, Giovanni Morone, to proceed to Speyer, whither the meeting had been summoned for June 1540. As the plague was raging in that city the conference took place in Hagenau. Neither the Elector of Saxony nor the Landgrave of Hesse could be induced to attend. Melanchthon was absent through illness. The leading Protestant theologians at the conference were Bucer, Brenz, Oswald Myconius, Ambrosius Blarer, and Urbanus Rhegius. The most prominent on the Catholic side were Johann Faber, Bishop of Vienna, and Eck. Present was John Calvin, then exiled from Geneva; he appeared as confidential agent of the King of France. After a month, King Ferdinand prorogued the conference to reassemble at Worms on 28 October.

Undismayed by the failure of the Hagenau conference, the emperor made more strenuous efforts for the success of the coming colloquy at Worms. He dispatched his minister Granvelle and Ortiz, his envoy, to the papal court. The latter brought with him the Jesuit Peter Faber. The pope sent the Bishop of Feltre, Tommaso Campeggio, brother of the cardinal, and ordered Morone to attend. They were not to take part in the debates, but were to watch events closely and report to Rome. Granvella opened the proceedings at Worms, 25 November, with an eloquent and conciliatory address. He pictured the evils which had befallen Germany, &quot;once the first of all nations in fidelity, religion, piety, and divine worship&quot;, and warned his hearers that &quot;all the evils that shall come upon you and your people, if, by clinging stubbornly to preconceived notions, you prevent a renewal of concord, will be ascribed to you as the authors of them.&quot; On behalf of the Protestants, Melanchthon returned &quot;an intrepid answer&quot;; he threw all the blame upon the Catholics, who refused to accept the new Gospel.

A great deal of time was spent in wrangling over points of order; finally it was decided that Eck should be spokesman for the Catholics and Melanchthon for the Protestants. The debate began 14 January 1541. The Augsburg Confession as the basis of the conference; the Augsburg Confession of 1540 was a different document from the Confession of 1530, having been changed by Melanchthon to suit his sacramentarian view of the Eucharist. Eck and Melanchthon battled four days over the topic of original sin and its consequences, and a formula was drafted to which both parties agreed, the Protestants with a reservation.

At this point Granvella suspended the conference, to be resumed at Regensburg, whither the emperor had summoned a diet, which he promised to attend in person. This diet, from which the emperor anticipated brilliant results, was called to order 5 April 1541. As legate of the pope appeared Cardinal Contarini, assisted by the nuncio Morone. Calvin was present, ostensibly to represent Lüneburg, in reality to foster discord in the interest of France. As collocutors at the religious conference which met simultaneously, Charles appointed Eck, Pflug, and Gropper for the Catholic side, and Melanchthon, Bucer, and Pistorius for the Protestants. A document of mysterious origin, the &quot;Regensburg Book&quot;, was presented by Joachim of Brandenburg as the basis of agreement. This compilation, it developed later, was the result of secret conferences, held during the meeting at Worms, between the Protestants, Bucer and Wolfgang Capito, on one side, and the Lutheranizing Gropper and a secretary of the emperor named Veltwick on the other. It consisted of twenty-three chapters, in which the attempt was made so to formulate the controverted doctrines that each party might find its own views therein expressed. How much Charles and Granvella had to do in the transaction, is unknown; they certainly knew and approved of it. The &quot;Book&quot; had been submitted by the Elector of Brandenburg to the judgment of Luther and Melanchthon; and their contemptuous treatment of it augured ill for its success.

When it was shown to the legate and Morone, the latter was for rejecting it summarily; Contarini, after making a score of emendations, notably emphasizing in Article 14 the dogma of Transubstantiation, declared that now &quot;as a private person&quot; he could accept it; but as legate he must consult with the Catholic theologians. Eck secured the substitution of a conciser exposition of the doctrine of justification. Thus emended, the &quot;Book&quot; was presented to the collocutors by Granvella for consideration. The first four articles, treating of man before the fall, free will, the origin of sin, and original sin, were accepted. The battle began in earnest when the fifth article, on justification, was reached. After long and vehement debates, a formula was presented by Bucer and accepted by the majority, so worded as to be capable of bearing a Catholic and a Lutheran interpretation. Naturally, it was unsatisfactory to both parties. The Holy See condemned it and administered a severe rebuke to Contarini for not protesting against it. No greater success was attained as to the other articles of importance.

On 22 May the conference ended, and the emperor was informed as to the articles agreed upon and those on which agreement was impossible. Charles was sorely disappointed, but he was powerless to effect anything further. The decree known as the &quot;Regensburg Interim&quot;, published 28 July 1541, enjoining upon both sides the observance of the articles agreed upon by the theologians, was by both sides disregarded.

Equally without result was the last of the conferences summoned by Charles at Regensburg, 1546, just prior to the outbreak of the Smalkaldic War.

<doc id="410768" wikidata="Q10885857" url="?curid=410768" title="Sea-Monkeys">
<text>Sea-Monkeys is a marketing term for brine shrimp (&quot;Artemia&quot;) sold as novelty aquarium pets. Developed in the United States in 1957 by Harold von Braunhut, they are sold as eggs intended to be added to water, and most often come bundled in a kit of three pouches and instructions. Sometimes a small tank and additional pouches are included. The product was marketed in the 1960s and 70s, especially in comic books, and remains a presence in popular culture.

==History==

Ant farms had been popularized in 1956 by Milton Levine. Harold von Braunhut invented a brine-shrimp-based product the next year, 1957. Von Braunhut collaborated with a marine biologist, Anthony D’Agostino, to develop the proper mix of nutrients and chemicals in dry form that could be added to plain tap water to create a suitable habitat for the shrimp to thrive. Von Braunhut was granted a patent for this process on July 4, 1972.

They were initially called &quot;Instant Life&quot; and sold for $0.49, but von Braunhut changed the name to &quot;Sea-Monkeys&quot; in 1962. The new name was based on their salt-water habitat, together with the supposed resemblance of the animals&#x27; tails to those of monkeys.

Sea-Monkeys were intensely marketed in comic books throughout the 1960s and early 1970s using illustrations by the comic-book illustrator Joe Orlando. These showed humanoid animals that bore no resemblance to the crustaceans. Many purchasers were disappointed by the dissimilarity and by the short lifespan of the animals. Von Braunhut is quoted as stating: &quot;I think I bought something like 3.2 million pages of comic book advertising a year. It worked beautifully.&quot;

==Use==

A colony is started by adding the contents of a packet labeled &quot;Water Purifier&quot; to a tank of water. This packet contains salt, water conditioner, and brine shrimp eggs. After 24 hours, this is augmented with the contents of a packet labeled &quot;Instant Life Eggs&quot;, containing more eggs, yeast, borax, soda, salt, some food, and sometimes a dye. Shortly after that, Sea-Monkeys hatch from the eggs that were in the &quot;Water Purifier&quot; packet. &quot;Growth Food&quot; containing yeast and spirulina is then added every seven days. The best temperature for hatching is 24-27°C. Additional pouches can be purchased on the official website, though these are not required for the well-being of the Sea-Monkeys.

&quot;Artemia&quot; usually has a lifespan of two to three months. Under ideal home conditions, pet sea-monkeys have been observed to live for up to five years. As they are easy to breed and care for, brine shrimp are also often used as a model organism in scientific research to study developmental biology, genetics, and toxicology.

==Biology==

The animals sold as Sea-Monkeys are claimed to be an artificial breed known as &quot;Artemia NYOS&quot;, formed by hybridizing different species of &quot;Artemia&quot;. The manufacturer also claims that they live longer and grow bigger than ordinary brine shrimp. They undergo cryptobiosis or anhydrobiosis, a condition of apparent lifelessness which allows them to survive the desiccation of the temporary pools in which they live. Sea-monkeys are known for their unique life-cycle. They hatch from eggs that can remain dormant for years until they are exposed to water. Once the eggs are in water, they hatch into nauplius larvae, which eventually develop into adult Sea-Monkeys. The entire life cycle takes around 8-10 weeks.
Astronaut John Glenn took Sea-Monkeys into space on October 29, 1998, aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; during mission STS-95. After nine days in space, they were returned to Earth and hatched eight weeks later, apparently unaffected by their travels.
However, earlier experiments on &quot;Apollo 16&quot; and &quot;Apollo 17&quot;, where the eggs (along with other biological systems in a state of rest, such as spores, seeds, and cysts) traveled to the Moon and back and were exposed to significant cosmic rays, observed a high sensitivity to cosmic radiation in the &quot;Artemia salina&quot; eggs; only 10% of the embryos which were induced to develop from eggs survived to adulthood. The most-common mutations found during the developmental stages of the irradiated eggs were deformations of the abdomen or deformations on the swimming-appendages and naupliar eye of the nauplius.

<text>So-Called Chaos is the sixth studio album (fourth released internationally) by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released on May 18, 2004, through Maverick Records. It was preceded by the single &quot;Everything&quot; on April 13, which went on to become Morissette&#x27;s lowest peaking song on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 76. The album was met with mixed reviews from critics upon release, with some calling it her most accessible record since &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (1995) while others criticized the project&#x27;s confusing messages and felt the singer had lost what made her a cultural icon of the &#x27;90s.

With 115,000 copies sold in its opening week, &quot;So-Called Chaos&quot; debuted at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and became Morissette&#x27;s first international studio album not to reach the top of that chart. It failed to surpass predecessor &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; (2002), which debuted at number-one with 215,000 first week sales. Two subsequent singles, &quot;Out Is Through&quot; and &quot;Eight Easy Steps&quot;, were released in July and October respectively, but neither managed to help improve album sales and both songs failed to enter the Hot 100.

==Background and release==
It had been two years since Morissette released her fifth studio album, &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot;. In that time she had met her then fiancé Ryan Reynolds, inspiring many of the songs she wrote for &quot;So-Called Chaos&quot;. The album found her in a more contented and relaxed state than her previous output, and her songs were brighter and happier than her more volatile works like &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; and &quot;Uninvited&quot;. One reporter asked if the song &quot;This Grudge&quot; was based on the same person as &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, and Morissette replied, &quot;Different person, same era.&quot;

The first single, &quot;Everything&quot;, was released to US radio in the spring of 2004, and was met with mixed reaction. US Adult Top 40 radio stations gave the song good airplay, but mainstream and top 40 stations were colder in their reception, and consequently it became Morissette&#x27;s lowest peaking single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Everything&quot; was included on the &quot;Totally Hits 2004, Vol. 2&quot; compilation, and in 2006 it was featured in the film &quot;Clerks II&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Some reviews of &quot;So-Called Chaos&quot; were positive, with many critics calling it her most accessible and mainstream record since her debut &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (1995). Still, others thought she had &quot;sold out&quot; for the sake of sales and radio play; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, for example, said the album &quot;attempts to reverse the sliding record sales following [&quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;].&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted at number two on the Canadian albums chart with first week sales of 11,200, and at number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 115,000 copies in its first week in the US and 287,000 that same week worldwide. In the United States, &quot;So-Called Chaos&quot; became Morissette&#x27;s first album to miss the number-one spot. It spent a week in the US top ten before falling down the chart. As of March 2012, the album has sold 474,000 copies in the US. The second single outside the US was &quot;Out Is Through&quot;, which had a poor showing in the UK. The second US single was &quot;Eight Easy Steps&quot;, which, despite being accompanied by an elaborate music video, failed to chart on the Hot 100 or cause a significant increase in sales of the album, which had already fallen off the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Excuses&quot; was released as a radio single in Brazil, where it peaked outside the top 40.

<text>Micromachines are mechanical objects that are fabricated in the same general manner as integrated circuits. They are generally considered to be between 100 nanometres to 100 micrometres in size, although that is debatable. The applications of micromachines include accelerometers that detect when a car has hit an object and trigger an airbag. Complex systems of gears and levers are another application.

==Fabrication==
The fabrication of these devices is usually done by two techniques, surface micromachining and bulk micromachining. To do bulk micromachining, the region needed is highly doped with boron and the unwanted silicon is etched in liquid silicon etches. This technique is termed an etchstop as the doping of boron produces an unetchable layer/pattern.

==Transducers==
Most micromachines act as transducers; in other words, they are either sensors or actuators.

Sensors convert information from the environment into interpretable electrical signals. One example of a micromachine sensor is a resonant chemical sensor. A lightly damped mechanical object vibrates much more at one frequency than any other, and this frequency is called its resonance frequency. A chemical sensor is coated with a special polymer that attracts certain molecules, such as those found in anthrax, and when those molecules attach to the sensor, its mass increases. The increased mass alters the resonance frequency of the mechanical object, which is detected with circuitry.

Actuators convert electrical signals and energy into motion of some kind. The three most common types of actuators are electrostatic, thermal, and magnetic. Electrostatic actuators use the force of electrostatic energy to move objects. Two mechanical elements, one that is stationary (the stator) and one that is movable (the rotor) have two different voltages applied to them, which creates an electric field. The field competes with a restoring force on the rotor (normally a spring force produced by the bending or stretching of the rotor) to move it. The greater the electric field, the further the rotor will move. Thermal actuators use the force of thermal expansion to move objects. When a material is heated, it expands an amount depending on material properties. Two objects can be connected in such a way that one object is heated more than the other and expands more, and this imbalance creates motion. The direction of motion depends on the connection between the objects. This is seen in a &quot;heatuator&quot;, which is a U-shaped beam with one wide arm and one narrow arm. When a current is passed through the object, heat is created. The narrow arm is heated more than the wide arm because they have the same current density. Since the two arms are connected at the top, the stretching hot arm pushes in the direction of the cold arm. Magnetic actuators used fabricated magnetic layers to create forces.

<text>Al-Awja () is a village 8 miles (13 km) south of Tikrit, Iraq on the western bank of the Tigris. It is mainly inhabited by Sunni Arabs.

The village is known for being the hometown and place of burial of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

When Saddam was captured by JSOC Task Force 121 and 4th Infantry Division during Operation Red Dawn, he was hidden only a few miles from Ad-Dawr. Saddam Hussein was buried in this village before dawn on December 31, 2006, less than 24 hours after his execution took place.

During the fighting in the Second Battle of Tikrit, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s tomb was levelled by ISIS. After Iraqi forces took control of the village, Shia militiamen of the Popular Mobilization Committee put its insignia around the village, including that of Major General Qasem Soleimani.

<doc id="410783" wikidata="Q3001783" url="?curid=410783" title="Cover crop">
<text>In agriculture, cover crops are plants that are planted to cover the soil rather than for the purpose of being harvested. Cover crops manage soil erosion, soil fertility, soil quality, water, weeds, pests, diseases, biodiversity and wildlife in an agroecosysteman ecological system managed and shaped by humans. Cover crops can increase microbial activity in the soil, which has a positive effect on nitrogen availability, nitrogen uptake in target crops, and crop yields. Cover crops reduce water pollution risks and remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Cover crops may be an off-season crop planted after harvesting the cash crop. Cover crops are nurse crops in that they increase the survival of the main crop being harvested, and are often grown over the winter. In the United States, cover cropping may cost as much as $35 per acre.

==Soil erosion==

Although cover crops can perform multiple functions in an agroecosystem simultaneously, they are often grown for the sole purpose of preventing soil erosion. Soil erosion is a process that can irreparably reduce the productive capacity of an agroecosystem. Cover crops reduce soil loss by improving soil structure and increasing infiltration, protecting the soil surface, scattering raindrop energy, and reducing the velocity of the movement of water over the soil surface. Dense cover crop stands physically slow down the velocity of rainfall before it contacts the soil surface, preventing soil splashing and erosive surface runoff. Additionally, vast cover crop root networks help anchor the soil in place and increase soil porosity, producing suitable habitat networks for soil macrofauna. It keeps the enrichment of the soil good for the next few years.

==Soil fertility management==

One of the primary uses of cover crops is to increase soil fertility. These types of cover crops are referred to as &quot;green manure&quot;. They are used to manage a range of soil macronutrients and micronutrients. Of the various nutrients, the impact that cover crops have on nitrogen management has received the most attention from researchers and farmers because nitrogen is often the most limiting nutrient in crop production.

Often, green manure crops are grown for a specific period, and then plowed under before reaching full maturity to improve soil fertility and quality. The stalks left block the soil from being eroded.

Green manure crops are commonly leguminous, meaning they are part of the pea family, Fabaceae. This family is unique in that all of the species in it set pods, such as bean, lentil, lupins and alfalfa. Leguminous cover crops are typically high in nitrogen and can often provide the required quantity of nitrogen for crop production. In conventional farming, this nitrogen is typically applied in chemical fertilizer form. In organic farming, nitrogen inputs may take the form of organic fertilizers, compost, cover crop seed, and fixation by legume cover crops. This quality of cover crops is called fertilizer replacement value.

Another quality unique to leguminous cover crops is that they form symbiotic relationships with the rhizobial bacteria that reside in legume root nodules. Lupins is nodulated by the soil microorganism &quot;Bradyrhizobium&quot; sp. (Lupinus). Bradyrhizobia are encountered as microsymbionts in other leguminous crops (&quot;Argyrolobium&quot;, &quot;Lotus&quot;, &quot;Ornithopus&quot;, &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Lupinus&quot;) of Mediterranean origin. These bacteria convert biologically unavailable atmospheric nitrogen gas () to biologically available ammonium () through the process of biological nitrogen fixation. In general, cover crops increase soil microbial activity, which has a positive effect on nitrogen availability in the soil, nitrogen uptake in target crops, and crop yields.

Prior to the advent of the Haber–Bosch process, an energy-intensive method developed to carry out industrial nitrogen fixation and create chemical nitrogen fertilizer, most nitrogen introduced to ecosystems arose through biological nitrogen fixation. Some scientists believe that widespread biological nitrogen fixation, achieved mainly through the use of cover crops, is the only alternative to industrial nitrogen fixation in the effort to maintain or increase future food production levels. Industrial nitrogen fixation has been criticized as an unsustainable source of nitrogen for food production due to its reliance on fossil fuel energy and the environmental impacts associated with chemical nitrogen fertilizer use in agriculture. Such widespread environmental impacts include nitrogen fertilizer losses into waterways, which can lead to eutrophication (nutrient loading) and ensuing hypoxia (oxygen depletion) of large bodies of water.

An example of this is in the Mississippi Valley Basin, where years of fertilizer nitrogen loading into the watershed from agricultural production have resulted in an annual summer hypoxic &quot;dead zone&quot; off the Gulf of Mexico that reached an area of over 22,000 square kilometers in 2017. The ecological complexity of marine life in this zone has been diminishing as a consequence.

As well as bringing nitrogen into agroecosystems through biological nitrogen fixation, types of cover crops known as &quot;catch crops&quot; are used to retain and recycle soil nitrogen already present. The catch crops take up surplus nitrogen remaining from fertilization of the previous crop, preventing it from being lost through leaching, or gaseous denitrification or volatilization.

Catch crops are typically fast-growing annual cereal species adapted to scavenge available nitrogen efficiently from the soil. The nitrogen fixed in catch crop biomass is released back into the soil once the cash crop is incorporated as a green manure or otherwise begins to decompose.

An example of green manure use comes from Nigeria, where the cover crop &quot;Mucuna pruriens&quot; (velvet bean) has been found to increase the availability of phosphorus in soil after a farmer applies rock phosphate.

==Soil quality management==
Cover crops can also improve soil quality by increasing soil organic matter levels through the input of cover crop biomass over time. Increased soil organic matter enhances soil structure as well as the water and nutrient holding and buffering capacities of the soil. It can also lead to increased soil carbon sequestration, which has been promoted as a strategy to help offset the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.

Soil quality is managed to produce optimum conditions for crops to flourish. The principal factors affecting soil quality are soil salination, pH, microorganism balance, and the prevention of soil contamination. It is noted that if soil quality is properly managed and maintained, it forms the foundation for a healthy and productive environment. One can design and manage a crop that will produce a healthy environment for quite some time.

==Water management==
By reducing soil erosion, cover crops often also reduce both the rate and quantity of water that drains off the field, which would normally pose environmental risks to waterways and ecosystems downstream. Cover crop biomass acts as a physical barrier between rainfall and the soil surface, allowing raindrops to steadily trickle down through the soil profile. Also, as stated above, cover crop root growth results in the formation of soil pores, which, in addition to enhancing soil macrofauna habitat provides pathways for water to filter through the soil profile rather than draining off the field as surface flow. With increased water infiltration, the potential for soil water storage and the recharge of aquifers can be improved.

Just before cover crops are killed (by such practices including mowing, tilling, discing, rolling, or herbicide application) they contain a large amount of moisture. When the cover crop is incorporated into the soil, or left on the soil surface, it often increases soil moisture. In agroecosystems where water for crop production is in short supply, cover crops can be used as a mulch to conserve water by shading and cooling the soil surface. This reduces the evaporation of soil moisture and helps preserve soil nutrients.

==Weed management==

Thick cover crop stands often compete well with weeds during the cover crop growth period, and can prevent most germinated weed seeds from completing their life cycle and reproducing. If the cover crop is flattened down on the soil surface rather than incorporated into the soil as a green manure after its growth is terminated, it can form a nearly impenetrable mat. This drastically reduces light transmittance to weed seeds, which in many cases reduces weed seed germination rates. Furthermore, even when weed seeds germinate, they often run out of stored energy for growth before building the necessary structural capacity to break through the cover crop mulch layer. This is often termed the &quot;cover crop smother effect&quot;.

Some cover crops suppress weeds both during growth and after death. During growth these cover crops compete vigorously with weeds for available space, light, and nutrients, and after death they smother the next flush of weeds by forming a mulch layer on the soil surface. For example, researchers found that when using &quot;Melilotus officinalis&quot; (yellow sweetclover) as a cover crop in an improved fallow system (where a fallow period is intentionally improved by any number of different management practices, including the planting of cover crops), weed biomass only constituted between 1–12% of total standing biomass at the end of the cover crop growing season. Furthermore, after cover crop termination, the yellow sweetclover residues suppressed weeds to levels 75–97% lower than in fallow (no yellow sweetclover) systems.

In addition to competition-based or physical weed suppression, certain cover crops are known to suppress weeds through allelopathy. This occurs when certain biochemical cover crop compounds are degraded that happen to be toxic to, or inhibit seed germination of, other plant species. Some well known examples of allelopathic cover crops are &quot;Secale cereale&quot; (rye), &quot;Vicia villosa&quot; (hairy vetch), &quot;Trifolium pratense&quot; (red clover), &quot;Sorghum bicolor&quot; (sorghum-sudangrass), and species in the family Brassicaceae, particularly mustards. In one study, rye cover crop residues were found to have provided between 80% and 95% control of early season broadleaf weeds when used as a mulch during the production of different cash crops such as soybean, tobacco, corn, and sunflower. In general, cover crops need not compete with cash crops, as they can be grown and terminated early on the season before other crops are established.

In a 2010 study released by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), scientists examined how rye seeding rates and planting patterns affected cover crop production. The results show that planting more pounds per acre of rye increased the cover crop&#x27;s production as well as decreased the amount of weeds. The same was true when scientists tested seeding rates on legumes and oats; a higher density of seeds planted per acre decreased the amount of weeds and increased the yield of legume and oat production. The planting patterns, which consisted of either traditional rows or grid patterns, did not seem to have a significant impact on the cover crop&#x27;s production or on the weed production in either cover crop. The ARS scientists concluded that increased seeding rates could be an effective method of weed control.

Cornell University&#x27;s Sustainable Cropping Systems Lab released a study in May 2023 investigating the effectiveness of time-sensitive planting and strategic coupling of cover crop variants with phylogenetically similar cash crops. The primary researcher, Uriel Menalled, discovered that if cover and cash crops are planted in accordance with his research findings, farmers can decrease weed growth by up to 99%. The study provides farmers with a comprehensive framework to identify cover crops that would best suit their existing cropping rotations. In sum, the results from this study support an understanding that phylogenetic relatedness can be harnessed to significantly suppress weed growth.

==Disease management==
In the same way that allelopathic properties of cover crops can suppress weeds, they can also break disease cycles and reduce populations of bacterial and fungal diseases, and parasitic nematodes. Species in the family Brassicaceae, such as mustards, have been widely shown to suppress fungal disease populations through the release of naturally occurring toxic chemicals during the degradation of glucosinolate compounds in their plant cell tissues.

==Pest management==
Some cover crops are used as so-called &quot;trap crops&quot;, to attract pests away from the crop of value and toward what the pest sees as a more favorable habitat. Trap crop areas can be established within crops, within farms, or within landscapes. In many cases, the trap crop is grown during the same season as the food crop being produced. The limited area occupied by these trap crops can be treated with a pesticide once pests are drawn to the trap in large enough numbers to reduce pest populations. In some organic systems, farmers drive over the trap crop with a large vacuum-based implement to physically pull the pests off the plants and out of the field. This system has been recommended for use to help control the lygus bugs in organic strawberry production. Another example of trap crops is nematode-resistant white mustard (&quot;Sinapis alba&quot;) and radish (&quot;Raphanus sativus&quot;). They can be grown after a main (cereal) crop and trap nematodes, for example, the beet cyst nematode and the Columbian root knot nematode. When grown, nematodes hatch and are attracted to the roots. After entering the roots they cannot reproduce in the root due to a hypersensitive resistance reaction of the plant. Hence the nematode population is greatly reduced, by 70–99%, depending on species and cultivation time.

Other cover crops are used to attract natural predators of pests by imitating elements of their habitat. This is a form of biological control known as habitat augmentation, but achieved with the use of cover crops. Findings on the relationship between cover crop presence and predator–pest population dynamics have been mixed, suggesting the need for detailed information on specific cover crop types and management practices to best complement a given integrated pest management strategy. For example, the predator mite &quot;Euseius tularensis&quot; (Congdon) is known to help control the pest citrus thrips in Central California citrus orchards. Researchers found that the planting of several different leguminous cover crops (such as bell bean, woollypod vetch, New Zealand white clover, and Austrian winter pea) provided sufficient pollen as a feeding source to cause a seasonal increase in &quot;E. tularensis&quot; populations, which with good could potentially introduce enough predatory pressure to reduce pest populations of citrus thrips.

==Biodiversity and wildlife==
Although cover crops are generally used to serve one of the above-discussed purposes, they often serve as habitats for wildlife. Cover crops add at least one more dimension of plant diversity to a cash crop rotation. Since the cover crop is typically not a crop of value, its management is usually less intensive, providing a window of &quot;soft&quot; human influence on the farm. This relatively &quot;hands-off&quot; management, combined with the increased on-farm heterogeneity produced by the establishment of cover crops, increases the likelihood that a more complex trophic structure will develop to support a higher level of wildlife diversity.

In one study, researchers compared arthropod and songbird species composition and field use between conventionally and cover cropped cotton fields in the Southern United States. The cover cropped cotton fields were planted to clover, which was left to grow in between cotton rows throughout the early cotton growing season (stripcover cropping). During the migration and breeding season, they found that songbird densities were 7–20 times higher in the cotton fields with an integrated clover cover crop than in the conventional cotton fields. Arthropod abundance and biomass was also higher in the clover c-cover fields throughout much of the songbird breeding season, which was attributed to an increased supply of flower nectar from the clover. The clover cover crop enhanced songbird habitat by providing covering sites, and an increased food source from higher arthropod populations.

<doc id="410784" wikidata="Q620992" url="?curid=410784" title="Criticism of the Catholic Church">
<text>During its long history, the Catholic Church has been subject to criticism regarding various beliefs and practices. Within the church, this often involves opposition or support for practices associated with traditionalist Catholicism. In the past, different interpretations of scripture and various other critiques contributed to schisms such as the schism with the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Protestant Reformation. This article however, discusses criticisms of the 20th and 21st century. The Catholic Church has also been criticized for some of its historical actions, such as the church&#x27;s promotion of the Crusades, and at various times by nationalist groups who feared the influence of Catholicism in undermining their regime. Furthermore, the Catholic Church has been criticized for not practicing ordination of women to the priesthood, its handling of incidents of sexual abuse, and various inter-faith interactions.

This article talks of both self-criticism of the Catholic church by people identifying as Catholic, and cross-criticism of people in other denominations of Christianity or other religions.

==Internal==
===Liturgical reforms===

Since 1970, the Mass has been celebrated in the local language of where it is celebrated, and the Mass in Latin less frequently. A minority of Catholics prefer the Mass to be celebrated in Latin, and eschew celebrations of the Mass of Paul VI. In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI loosened some restrictions on use of the Latin Mass with the aim of healing the rift that had come about between advocates of the Novus Ordo Mass and advocates of the Tridentine Mass. Pope Francis rescinded many of the provisions of &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot; with the promulgation of &quot;Traditionis custodes&quot; in 2021. 

===Ordination of women===
The teaching of the Catholic Church on ordination, as expressed in the Code of Canon Law, the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, and the apostolic letter &quot;Ordinatio sacerdotalis&quot;, is that &quot;only a baptized man validly receives sacred ordination&quot;. According to Roman Catholic thinking, the priest is acting &#x27;in persona Christi&#x27; (that is, in the Person of Christ). In 1979, Sister Theresa Kane, then president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, challenged Pope John Paul II from the podium at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., to include women &quot;in all ministries of our Church&quot;. In his Apostolic Letter &quot;Ordinatio sacerdotalis&quot; (1994), Pope John Paul II said the &quot;Priestly ordination, … has in the Catholic Church from the beginning always been reserved to men alone.&quot; He cited the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (under Pope Paul VI) &quot;Declaration Inter Insigniores on the question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood&quot;, and declared that &quot;the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church&#x27;s faithful.&quot; The reasons given included: &quot;the example recorded in the Sacred Scriptures of Christ choosing his Apostles only from among men; the constant practice of the Church, which has imitated Christ in choosing only men; and her living teaching authority which has consistently held that the exclusion of women from the priesthood is in accordance with God&#x27;s plan for his Church.&quot;

Several Catholic groups, nonetheless, say the matter should still be open for discussion, and dissenters do not regard &quot;Ordinatio sacerdotalis&quot; as definitive church teaching. But in June 2018 Pope Francis said, &quot;We cannot do this with Holy Orders (women priests) because dogmatically we cannot. Pope John Paul II was clear and closed the door and I&#x27;m not going to go back on that. It [John Paul&#x27;s decision] was serious, it was not a capricious thing.&quot; But from the start of his papacy Francis has pointed out that &quot;sacramental power is too closely identified with power in general. It must be remembered that when we speak of sacramental power &quot;we are in the realm of function, not that of dignity or holiness&#x27;&quot; (EG 104). Nevertheless, since the Second Vatican Council, women have taken an increased role in the church. In 1994, the Vatican Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments formally interpreted the 1983 Code of Canon Law, stating that women could assist at Mass as acolytes or altar servers. Women also serve as lectors and extraordinary ministers. Critics see the church&#x27;s position on the ordination of women as a sign that women are not equal to men in the Catholic Church, though the church rejects this inference. Pope Francis organized a Study Commission on the Women&#x27;s Diaconate to review and study the history of women&#x27;s service to the church, such as that of deaconesses. The Commission submitted its report to Pope Francis in January 2019.

===Finances===
Concerns about usury included the 19th-century Rothschild loans to the Holy See and 16th-century objections over abuse of the zinskauf clause. This was particularly problematic because the charging of interest (all interest, not just excessive interest) was a violation of doctrine at the time, such as that reflected in the 1745 encyclical &quot;Vix pervenit&quot;. As a result, work-arounds were employed. For example, in the 15th century, the Medici Bank lent money to the Vatican which was lax about repayment. Rather than charging interest, &quot;the Medici overcharged the pope on the silks and brocades, the jewels and other commodities they supplied.&quot; However, the 1917 Code of Canon Law switched position and allowed church monies to be used to accrue interest.

Italian priest Pino Puglisi refused money from Mafia members when offered it for the traditional feast day celebrations, and also resisted the Mafia in other ways, for which he was martyred in 1993.

In 2014, Pope Francis criticized the practice of charging altarage fees or honorariums for things like baptisms, blessings, and Mass intentions (such as Masses for the dead).

In 2018, Pope Francis criticized the selling of Masses for the dead, stating, &quot;the Mass is not paid for, redemption is free, if I want to make an offering, well and good, but Mass is free.&quot;
==Interfaith==
===Judaism===
In the Middle Ages, religion played a major role in driving antisemitism. &quot;Adversus Judaeos&quot; (&quot;against the Jews&quot;) are a series of fourth century homilies by John Chrysostom directed to members of the church of Antioch of his time, which continued to observe Jewish feasts and fasts. Critical of this, he cast Judaism and the synagogues in his city in a critical and negative light. The use of hyperbole and other rhetorical devices painted a harsh and negative picture of the Jews. This was largely ignored until the Jewish anti-Christian teachings began to surface in Muslim Andalusia in the 11th and 12th centuries. According to historian William I. Brustein, his sermons against Jews gave further momentum to the idea that Jews are collectively responsible for the death of Jesus. &quot;Over the course of time, Christians began to accept ... that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible for killing Jesus. According to this interpretation, both the Jews present at Jesus&#x27; death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time, have committed the sin of deicide, or God-killing. For 1900 years of Christian-Jewish history, the charge of deicide has led to hatred, violence against and murder of Jews in Europe and America.&quot;

In 1998, Pope John Paul II apologized for the failure of Catholics to help Jews during the Holocaust and acknowledged that Christian antisemitism might have made easier Nazi persecution of the Jews, whom the Pope called &quot;our elder brothers&quot; in the faith.

The 2007 &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;, allowing a wider use of the Tridentine Mass, raised concerns in the Jewish community regarding the Good Friday liturgy which contained a prayer &quot;For the conversion of the Jews&quot; referring to Jewish &quot;blindness&quot; and prays for them to be &quot;delivered from their darkness.&quot; The American Jewish Committee said that this raises &quot;negative implications that some in the Jewish community and beyond have drawn concerning the &quot;motu proprio&quot;.&quot; Pope Benedict XVI in 2008 replaced the prayer in the 1962 Missal with a newly composed prayer that makes no mention of blindness or darkness.

===Russian Orthodoxy===
In 2007, the then Eastern Orthodox Patriarch Alexei II of Moscow objected to what he termed &quot;proselytizing&quot; by clerics of the Eastern Rite of the Catholic Church. Catholic officials replied that their efforts in Russia were not aimed at Eastern Orthodox believers, but were reaching out to the vast majority of Russians who are not churchgoers. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith rejected the characterization of &quot;proselytizing&quot; and said that respect towards non-Catholic Christians must not negate the possibility of conversion, if an individual should so choose.

===Protestantism===
Common factors that played a role during the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation included the rise of nationalism, simony, the appointment of Cardinal-nephews, the sale of indulgences, and other corruption in the Roman Curia and other ecclesiastical hierarchy, as well as the impact of humanism, the new learning of the Renaissance, the epistemological shift between the &quot;schola moderna&quot; and &quot;schola antiqua&quot; within scholasticism, and the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy.

Key events of the period include Martin Luther nailing the 95 theses (1517), the Council of Trent (1545–1563), the excommunication of Elizabeth I (1570), the Battle of Lepanto (1571), the adoption of the Gregorian calendar under Pope Gregory XIII, the French Wars of Religion, the Long Turkish War, the final phases of the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), and the formation of the last Holy League by Innocent XI during the Great Turkish War.

Protestants hold doctrinal differences with the Catholic Church in a number of areas, including the understanding of the meaning of the word &quot;faith&quot; and how it relates to &quot;good works&quot; in terms of salvation, and a difference of opinion regarding the concept of &quot;justification&quot;; also regarding the Catholic Church&#x27;s belief in sacred tradition as a source of revelation complementary to sacred scripture. Some scholars of Early Christianity are adherents of the New Perspective on Paul and so believe &quot;sola fide&quot; is a misinterpretation and that Paul was actually speaking about laws (such as circumcision, dietary laws, Sabbath, temple rituals, etc.) that were considered essential for the Jews of the time.

===Islam===
In September 2006, Pope Benedict XVI delivered the Regensburg lecture at the University of Regensburg in Germany, where he had once served as a professor of theology. It was entitled &quot;Faith, Reason and the UniversityMemories and Reflections&quot;. In his lecture, the Pope, speaking in German, quoted a passage about Islam made at the end of the 14th century by Byzantine (Eastern Roman) emperor Manuel II Palaiologos. As the English translation of the Pope&#x27;s lecture was disseminated across the world, the quotation was taken out of context and many Islamic politicians and religious leaders protested against what they saw as an insulting mischaracterization of Islam. Mass street protests were mounted in many Islamic countries. The Pope maintained that the comment he had quoted did not reflect his own views.

=== Buddhism ===
In 1994, Pope John Paul II wrote &quot;Crossing the Threshold of Hope&quot;, in which he discussed various non-Christian religions, including Buddhism. The book prompted widespread criticism from the Buddhist community, and the pope&#x27;s statements were characterized as misunderstanding and offending Buddhism. Thinley Norbu Rinpoche, a Tibetan Buddhist lama, wrote a book to address the &quot;serious, gratuitous misrepresentations of Buddhist doctrine which seemed to be based on misunderstandings&quot; contained within &quot;Crossing the Threshold of Hope&quot;. Bhikkhu Bodhi, a Theravada Buddhism scholar, published an essay &quot;intended as a short corrective to the Pope&#x27;s demeaning characterization of Buddhism&quot; entitled &quot;Toward a Threshold of Understanding&quot;.

==Historical==

===Response to heresy===
The development of doctrine, the position of orthodoxy, and the relationship between the early Church and early heretical groups is a matter of academic debate. Before the 12th century, Christianity gradually suppressed what it saw as heresy, usually through a system of ecclesiastical sanctions, excommunication, and anathema. Later, an accusation of heresy could be construed as treason against lawful civil rule, and therefore punishable by civil sanctions such as confiscation of property, imprisonment, or death, though the latter was not frequently imposed, as this form of punishment had many ecclesiastical opponents. Within five years of the official &#x27;criminalization&#x27; of heresy by the emperor, the first Christian heretic, Priscillian, was executed in 385 by Roman officials. For some years after the Protestant Reformation, Protestant denominations were also known to execute those whom they considered heretics.

When John Paul II visited Prague in the 1990s, he apologized for the execution of Jan Hus on charges of heresy and requested experts in this matter &quot;to define with greater clarity the position held by Jan Hus among the Church&#x27;s reformers&quot;, and acknowledged that &quot;independently of the theological convictions he defended, Hus cannot be denied integrity in his personal life and commitment to the nation&#x27;s moral education.&quot;

In 2015, after visiting a Waldensian Temple in Turin, Pope Francis, in the name of the Catholic Church, asked Waldensian Christians for forgiveness for their persecution. The Pope apologized for the church&#x27;s &quot;un-Christian and even inhumane positions and actions&quot;.

===Crusades===

The Crusades were a series of military conflicts, with a religious as well as a socio-political character, waged against external and internal threats by much of Christian Europe. The Crusades were waged against Muslims, Slavs, Mongols, Cathars, Hussites and political enemies of the popes. The Crusaders made vows and were granted an indulgence.

Elements of the Crusades were criticized by some from the time of their inception in 1095. Roger Bacon believed that the Crusades were counter-productive because, &quot;those who survive, together with their children, are more and more embittered against the Christian faith.&quot; In spite of some criticism, the movement was still widely supported in Europe long after the fall of Acre in 1291. After that event, the Crusades to recover Jerusalem and the Christian East were unsuccessful. Eighteenth-century rationalists harshly criticized the Crusaders . In the 1950s, Sir Steven Runciman published a highly critical account of the Crusades in which he referred to the practice of Holy War as &quot;a sin against the Holy Ghost&quot;.
===Nationalist critique===
As early as the second century, Justin Martyr addressed his &quot;First Apology&quot; to the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius in order to convince him that Christians could be good citizens. In addition to arguing against the persecution of individuals solely because they were Christians, Justin also provided the Emperor with a defense of the philosophy of Christianity along with a detailed description of contemporary Christian practices and rituals. In many instances concern regarding the loyalty of Catholics arose in the context of perceived political threats. In 1570, Pope Pius V issued a papal bull titled &quot;Regnans in Excelsis&quot;, which declared Elizabeth I to be excommunicated and a heretic. Concerned at the possibility that, in the event of an attack by the Catholic monarchs of France and Spain, English Catholics might side with the invaders, Parliament enacted restrictive legislation against Catholics. The initial favorable reception of Jesuits in Japan changed when Toyotomi Hideyoshi became disturbed by the external threats posed by the expansion of European power in East Asia. Hideyoshi was apprehensive that Portugal and Spain might provide military support to Dom Justo Takayama, a Christian &quot;daimyō&quot; in western Japan. The San Felipe incident (1596) involved the Spanish captain of a shipwrecked trading vessel, who, in an attempt to recover his cargo, made the claim that the missionaries (many of whom had arrived with the Portuguese) were there to prepare Japan for conquest. Hideyoshi was concerned that divided loyalties might lead to dangerous rebels like the Ikkō-ikki Sect of earlier years and issued an edict expelling missionaries.

The Reichskonkordat of 1933 was an agreement between the Holy See and Germany, negotiated by Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) and Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen on behalf of President Paul von Hindenburg. While the treaty preserved the church&#x27;s ecclesiastical and educational institutions, and guaranteed the right to pastoral care in hospitals, prisons and similar institutions, it also required all clergy to abstain from membership in political parties, and not support political causes. Hitler routinely disregarded the concordat and permitted a persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany. Shortly before the 20 July signing of the Reichskonkordat, Germany signed similar agreements with the state Protestant churches in Germany, although the Confessing Church opposed the regime. Nazi breaches of the agreement began almost as soon as it had been signed and intensified afterwards leading to protest from the church including in the 1937 encyclical &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; of Pope Pius XI, followed in 1943 by &quot;Mystici corporis Christi&quot; of Pope Pius XII which condemned forced conversions, the murder of disabled people, and the exclusion of people on the basis of race or nationality. The Nazis planned to eliminate the church&#x27;s influence by restricting its organizations to purely religious activities.

In a series of sermons in the summer of 1941, Clemens August Graf von Galen, Bishop of Munster, denounced the Nazi regime for its Gestapo tactics and policies, including euthanasia, and attacked the Third Reich for undermining justice. He stated: &quot;As a German, as a decent citizen, I demand justice&quot;. In the view of SS General Jürgen Stroop, German patriotism &quot;was tainted by Papist ideals, which have been harmful to Germany for centuries. Besides, the Archbishop&#x27;s [Clemens August Graf von Galen] orders came from outside the Fatherland, a fact which disturbed us. We all know that despite its diverse factions, the Catholic Church is a world community, which sticks together when the chips are down.&quot; &quot;There is no doubt that in the long run Nazi leaders such as Hitler and Himmler intended to eradicate Christianity just as ruthlessly as any other rival ideology, even if in the short term they had to be content to make compromises with it.&quot;

Catholic clergy have been implicated in the violent repression by the Ustaše regime in Croatia during the Second World War.
===Sexual abuse scandals===

In January 2002, cases in which priests were accused of sexually abusing children were widely reported by the news media. A survey of the ten largest U.S. dioceses found that 234 priests, out of a total of 25,616 priests in those dioceses, have been accused of sexually abusing children in the last 50 years. The report does not state how many of these allegations have been proven true in courts. Victims of such abuse filed lawsuits against a number of dioceses, resulting in multi-million dollar settlements in some cases. In response, in June 2002, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops initiated strict new guidelines (&quot;zero tolerance&quot;) for the protection of children and youth in Catholic institutions across the country. In February 2019, the Catholic Church held a worldwide summit of bishops in Rome to discuss the steps that can be taken to prevent the sexual abuse of children and vulnerable adults.

A January 2003 review by The New York Times counted 1,205 allegedly abusive priests nationwide over five decades, based on court records and media reports.

===Canadian Indigenous residential schools===
The Indian residential school system in Canada was a network of boarding schools for indigenous peoples. Children were removed from their parents&#x27; homes, often forcibly, and sent to the schools. In 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission estimated that more than 4000 students have died due to this system. About 60% of the Canadian Indian residential schools were operated by the Catholic church under federal and provincial government sponsorship and funding. The commission says that students died due to lack of facilities, disease, suicide, and abuse at the hands of those operating the schools.

<doc id="410786" wikidata="Q2549671" url="?curid=410786" title="Something Like Human">
<text>Something Like Human is the second album by American rock band Fuel, released on September 19, 2000, by Epic Records. &quot;Something Like Human&quot; peaked at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was preceded by the single &quot;Hemorrhage (In My Hands)&quot;, which peaked at number 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and remains their highest-charting song. The album&#x27;s title comes from the lyric heard on its sixth track, &quot;Prove&quot;.

It remains Fuel&#x27;s best-selling album. One year after its release, the album received double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album also received gold certification by Music Canada (MC) in June 2001. Likewise with the band&#x27;s previous album, it received moderate to average critical reception, with praise directed towards lead singer Brett Scallions.

The bonus version of the album includes an acoustic version of &quot;Hemorrhage&quot; and also includes the cover songs &quot;Daniel&quot;, originally by Elton John, and &quot;Going to California&quot; by Led Zeppelin. In addition, these were also included on the album&#x27;s bonus disc, which also contained the track &quot;Walk the Sky&quot; (previously made available on the reissue of the band&#x27;s previous album), as well as music videos for &quot;Hemorrhage (In My Hands)&quot; and &quot;Innocent&quot; when inserted into a DVD player. The album&#x27;s song &quot;Empty Spaces&quot; was used in the 2002 romance film &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;, as well as its accompanying soundtrack.

==Critical reception==

Ultimately giving the album a &quot;B&quot;,&quot; Entertainment Weekly&quot; said the band &quot;has more chops than a butcher shop. But when it comes to passion, Fuel runs low.&quot; The magazine concluded that &quot;luckily, Bret Scallions&#x27; excoriating voice makes up for Carl Bell&#x27;s rather clinical-sounding music.&quot;

==Track listing==
All songs written by Carl Bell, except where noted.


*Early promotional press editions of the album (submitted to magazines, etc. for reviews) included the songs &quot;Sister Mary Innocent&quot; and the Scallions penned &quot;Bruises&quot;, which ultimately were left off the final sequence of the album which was released to stores. Neither of these recordings have been released publicly by the band. &quot;Sister Mary Innocent&quot; appeared by alternate name &quot;Sister Mary&quot; on Tommy Lee&#x27;s 2005 solo album &quot;&quot;, with Carl Bell on guitar.

==Personnel==
*Brett Scallions - lead vocals, rhythm guitar
*Carl Bell - lead guitar, backing vocals
*Jeff Abercrombie - bass 
*Kevin Miller - drums

Additional personnel

*Luis Resto - Keyboards
*Carol Steele - Percussion

<text>Torpoint () is a town and civil parish on the Rame Peninsula in southeast Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is situated opposite the city of Plymouth across the Hamoaze which is the tidal estuary of the River Tamar.
Torpoint had a population of 8,457 at the 2001 census, decreasing to 8,364 at the 2011 census. Two electoral wards also exist (Torpoint East and Torpoint West). Their combined populations at the same census were 7,717.

Torpoint is linked to Plymouth (and Devonport) by the Torpoint Ferry. The three vessels that operate the service are chain ferries – that is, they are propelled across the river by pulling themselves on fixed chains which lie across the bed of the river. The journey takes about seven minutes.

==Origin of name==
It is said that Torpoint&#x27;s name is derived from Tar Point, a name given because of the initial industry on the west bank of the Hamoaze. However this is actually a nickname given by workers, Torpoint meaning &quot;rocky headland&quot;.

==History==
Torpoint is an eighteenth-century planned town. The grid-based design for the town was commissioned by Reginald Pole Carew in the Parish of Antony in 1774. His family continue to have a strong influence in the area, having become the Carew Poles in the twentieth century, and still reside at their family seat, Antony House.

In 1796 Torpoint was the setting for a shooting battle between the crew of a government vessel, the &quot;Viper&quot;, and a large party of armed liquor smugglers, in which one person was killed and five people seriously wounded.

Due to the presence of Devonport Dockyard, the town grew as Dockyard workers settled there. The establishment of the Royal Navy&#x27;s main training facility, HMS &quot;Raleigh&quot; also increased the population of Torpoint.

=== Parish churches ===
Torpoint has 4 parish churches known at &quot;Maryfield Church&quot;, &quot;Torpoint Cornerstone Church&quot; , &quot;Catholic Church of Saint Joan of Arc&quot; and &quot;St James Church&quot;

===Notable people from Torpoint===
&quot;See :Category:People from Torpoint&quot;
*John Langdon Down was born in Torpoint in 1828. He later described the medical condition which is now referred to as Down syndrome. He was called back on a number of occasions to help his father in his local business until his father&#x27;s death in 1853.
* Jack Stephens a footballer for Southampton F.C..

==Education==
Educational institutions in Torpoint include:

*Torpoint Infant School — a medium-large infant school.
*Carbeile Junior School — a large primary school.
*Torpoint Community College, a small secondary school.

==Sport and leisure==
Torpoint has a non-league football club, Torpoint Athletic F.C., which plays at The Mill.

===Cornish wrestling===
Cornish wrestling tournaments, for prizes, were held in Torpoint in the 1700s.

==Twinning==
Torpoint is twinned with Benodet (Benoded) in Brittany, France.

== Town Council ==
1894 The Torpoint Town Council was established with Joseph Shepheard as its chairman.

Ron Widdecombe was the first Mayor of Torpoint.

The Town Council has Gary Davis as the town mayor and Julie Martin as the deputy mayor.

The Town Council is made up of 15 East Ward councillors and 1 West Ward councillor.

<doc id="410791" wikidata="Q4851546" url="?curid=410791" title="Ballast pond">
<text>A ballast pond was a construction found in shipyards during the age of sail. The feature was often a prominent part of the large dockyards of the Royal Navy, where large numbers of warships would be laid up &#x27;in ordinary&#x27; during periods of peace, when the navy retained only some of its ships in active commission. Ships in ordinary often had their stores and guns removed, as well as their masts. Consequently, their ballast, often made up of varying quantities of stone, was increased to compensate. When the ships were reactivated, and fitted with stores and guns, large quantities of ballast was removed.

The ballast that was removed would be taken on barges to the ballast pond, a large square pond dug along the sides of a tidal river, and accessed by an opening to the river by which the water flowed in and out of the pond, and by which the barges entered and exited. The ballast was then dumped in the pond. Over time the tidal action of the water flowing in and out filtered the ballast in the pond, removing any impurities. The filtered ballast could then be recovered and returned to the dockyard to replace ballast in other ships being put in ordinary, or that otherwise needed extra ballast.

One example of a ballast pond, now used as a mini harbour, is off Torpoint, a town close to Devonport Dockyard.

<doc id="410793" wikidata="Q217219" url="?curid=410793" title="Continuity equation">
<text>A continuity equation or transport equation is an equation that describes the transport of some quantity. It is particularly simple and powerful when applied to a conserved quantity, but it can be generalized to apply to any extensive quantity. Since mass, energy, momentum, electric charge and other natural quantities are conserved under their respective appropriate conditions, a variety of physical phenomena may be described using continuity equations.

Continuity equations are a stronger, local form of conservation laws. For example, a weak version of the law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed—i.e., the total amount of energy in the universe is fixed. This statement does not rule out the possibility that a quantity of energy could disappear from one point while simultaneously appearing at another point. A stronger statement is that energy is &quot;locally&quot; conserved: energy can neither be created nor destroyed, &quot;nor&quot; can it &quot;teleport&quot; from one place to another—it can only move by a continuous flow. A continuity equation is the mathematical way to express this kind of statement. For example, the continuity equation for electric charge states that the amount of electric charge in any volume of space can only change by the amount of electric current flowing into or out of that volume through its boundaries.

Continuity equations more generally can include &quot;source&quot; and &quot;sink&quot; terms, which allow them to describe quantities that are often but not always conserved, such as the density of a molecular species which can be created or destroyed by chemical reactions. In an everyday example, there is a continuity equation for the number of people alive; it has a &quot;source term&quot; to account for people being born, and a &quot;sink term&quot; to account for people dying.

Any continuity equation can be expressed in an &quot;integral form&quot; (in terms of a flux integral), which applies to any finite region, or in a &quot;differential form&quot; (in terms of the divergence operator) which applies at a point.

Continuity equations underlie more specific transport equations such as the convection–diffusion equation, Boltzmann transport equation, and Navier–Stokes equations.

Flows governed by continuity equations can be visualized using a Sankey diagram.

==General equation==

===Definition of flux===
A continuity equation is useful when a flux can be defined. To define flux, first there must be a quantity which can flow or move, such as mass, energy, electric charge, momentum, number of molecules, etc. Let be the volume density of this quantity, that is, the amount of per unit volume.

The way that this quantity is flowing is described by its flux. The flux of is a vector field, which we denote as j. Here are some examples and properties of flux:
* The dimension of flux is &quot;amount of flowing per unit time, through a unit area&quot;. For example, in the mass continuity equation for flowing water, if 1 gram per second of water is flowing through a pipe with cross-sectional area 1 cm2, then the average mass flux inside the pipe is , and its direction is along the pipe in the direction that the water is flowing. Outside the pipe, where there is no water, the flux is zero.
* If there is a velocity field which describes the relevant flow—in other words, if all of the quantity at a point is moving with velocity —then the flux is by definition equal to the density times the velocity field:
: formula_1
: For example, if in the mass continuity equation for flowing water, is the water&#x27;s velocity at each point, and is the water&#x27;s density at each point, then would be the mass flux, also known as the material discharge.
* In a well-known example, the flux of electric charge is the electric current density.

* If there is an imaginary surface , then the surface integral of flux over is equal to the amount of that is passing through the surface per unit time:

: in which formula_2 is a surface integral.

(Note that the concept that is here called &quot;flux&quot; is alternatively termed flux density in some literature, in which context &quot;flux&quot; denotes the surface integral of flux density. See the main article on Flux for details.)

=== Integral form===

The integral form of the continuity equation states that:
* The amount of in a region increases when additional flows inward through the surface of the region, and decreases when it flows outward;
* The amount of in a region increases when new is created inside the region, and decreases when is destroyed;
* Apart from these two processes, there is &quot;no other way&quot; for the amount of in a region to change.

Mathematically, the integral form of the continuity equation expressing the rate of increase of within a volume is:

where
* is any imaginary closed surface, that encloses a volume ,
* formula_3 denotes a surface integral over that closed surface,
* is the total amount of the quantity in the volume ,
* is the flux of ,
* is time,
* is the net rate that is being generated inside the volume per unit time. When is being generated, it is called a &quot;source&quot; of , and it makes more positive. When is being destroyed, it is called a &quot;sink&quot; of , and it makes more negative. This term is sometimes written as formula_4 or the total change of q from its generation or destruction inside the control volume.

In a simple example, could be a building, and could be the number of people in the building. The surface would consist of the walls, doors, roof, and foundation of the building. Then the continuity equation states that the number of people in the building increases when people enter the building (an inward flux through the surface), decreases when people exit the building (an outward flux through the surface), increases when someone in the building gives birth (a source, ), and decreases when someone in the building dies (a sink, ).

===Differential form===

By the divergence theorem, a general continuity equation can also be written in a &quot;differential form&quot;:

where
* is divergence,
* is the density of the amount (i.e. the quantity per unit volume),
* is the flux of (i.e. j = ρv, where v is the vector field describing the movement of the quantity ),
* is time,
* is the generation of per unit volume per unit time. Terms that generate (i.e., ) or remove (i.e., ) are referred to as a sources and sinks respectively.

This general equation may be used to derive any continuity equation, ranging from as simple as the volume continuity equation to as complicated as the Navier–Stokes equations. This equation also generalizes the advection equation. Other equations in physics, such as Gauss&#x27;s law of the electric field and Gauss&#x27;s law for gravity, have a similar mathematical form to the continuity equation, but are not usually referred to by the term &quot;continuity equation&quot;, because in those cases does not represent the flow of a real physical quantity.

In the case that is a conserved quantity that cannot be created or destroyed (such as energy), and the equations become:
formula_5

== Electromagnetism ==

In electromagnetic theory, the continuity equation is an empirical law expressing (local) charge conservation. Mathematically it is an automatic consequence of Maxwell&#x27;s equations, although charge conservation is more fundamental than Maxwell&#x27;s equations. It states that the divergence of the current density (in amperes per square meter) is equal to the negative rate of change of the charge density (in coulombs per cubic meter),
formula_6

{\partial t}. &lt;/math&gt;

Taking the divergence of both sides (the divergence and partial derivative in time commute) results in
formula_7
but the divergence of a curl is zero, so that
formula_8

But Gauss&#x27;s law (another Maxwell equation), states that
formula_9
which can be substituted in the previous equation to yield the continuity equation
formula_10

Current is the movement of charge. The continuity equation says that if charge is moving out of a differential volume (i.e., divergence of current density is positive) then the amount of charge within that volume is going to decrease, so the rate of change of charge density is negative. Therefore, the continuity equation amounts to a conservation of charge.

If magnetic monopoles exist, there would be a continuity equation for monopole currents as well, see the monopole article for background and the duality between electric and magnetic currents.

== Fluid dynamics ==

In fluid dynamics, the continuity equation states that the rate at which mass enters a system is equal to the rate at which mass leaves the system plus the accumulation of mass within the system.
The differential form of the continuity equation is:
formula_11
where
* is fluid density,
* is time,
* is the flow velocity vector field.

The time derivative can be understood as the accumulation (or loss) of mass in the system, while the divergence term represents the difference in flow in versus flow out. In this context, this equation is also one of the Euler equations (fluid dynamics). The Navier–Stokes equations form a vector continuity equation describing the conservation of linear momentum.

If the fluid is incompressible (volumetric strain rate is zero), the mass continuity equation simplifies to a volume continuity equation:
formula_12
which means that the divergence of the velocity field is zero everywhere. Physically, this is equivalent to saying that the local volume dilation rate is zero, hence a flow of water through a converging pipe will adjust solely by increasing its velocity as water is largely incompressible.

== Computer vision ==

In computer vision, optical flow is the pattern of apparent motion of objects in a visual scene. Under the assumption that brightness of the moving object did not change between two image frames, one can derive the optical flow equation as:
formula_13
where
* is time,
* coordinates in the image,
* is the image intensity at image coordinate and time ,
* is the optical flow velocity vector formula_14 at image coordinate and time 

== Energy and heat ==

Conservation of energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed. (See below for the nuances associated with general relativity.) Therefore, there is a continuity equation for energy flow:
formula_15
where
* , local energy density (energy per unit volume),
* , energy flux (transfer of energy per unit cross-sectional area per unit time) as a vector,

An important practical example is the flow of heat. When heat flows inside a solid, the continuity equation can be combined with Fourier&#x27;s law (heat flux is proportional to temperature gradient) to arrive at the heat equation. The equation of heat flow may also have source terms: Although &quot;energy&quot; cannot be created or destroyed, &quot;heat&quot; can be created from other types of energy, for example via friction or joule heating.

== Probability distributions ==

If there is a quantity that moves continuously according to a stochastic (random) process, like the location of a single dissolved molecule with Brownian motion, then there is a continuity equation for its probability distribution. The flux in this case is the probability per unit area per unit time that the particle passes through a surface. According to the continuity equation, the negative divergence of this flux equals the rate of change of the probability density. The continuity equation reflects the fact that the molecule is always somewhere—the integral of its probability distribution is always equal to 1—and that it moves by a continuous motion (no teleporting).

== Quantum mechanics ==
Quantum mechanics is another domain where there is a continuity equation related to &quot;conservation of probability&quot;. The terms in the equation require the following definitions, and are slightly less obvious than the other examples above, so they are outlined here:

* The wavefunction for a single particle in position space (rather than momentum space), that is, a function of position and time , .
* The probability density function is formula_16
* The probability of finding the particle within at is denoted and defined by formula_17
* The probability current (probability flux) is formula_18

With these definitions the continuity equation reads:
formula_19

Either form may be quoted. Intuitively, the above quantities indicate this represents the flow of probability. The &quot;chance&quot; of finding the particle at some position and time flows like a fluid; hence the term &quot;probability current&quot;, a vector field. The particle itself does &quot;not&quot; flow deterministically in this vector field.

{\partial t}, \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where is the potential function. The partial derivative of with respect to is:
formula_20

Multiplying the Schrödinger equation by then solving for , and similarly multiplying the complex conjugated Schrödinger equation by then solving for ;
formula_21

substituting into the time derivative of :
formula_22

The Laplacian operators () in the above result suggest that the right hand side is the divergence of , and the reversed order of terms imply this is the negative of , altogether:
formula_23
so the continuity equation is:
formula_24

The integral form follows as for the general equation.

==Semiconductor==
The total current flow in the semiconductor consists of drift current and diffusion current of both the electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band.

General form for electrons in one-dimension:
formula_25
where:
* &quot;n&quot; is the local concentration of electrons
* formula_26 is electron mobility
* &quot;E&quot; is the electric field across the depletion region
* &quot;Dn&quot; is the diffusion coefficient for electrons
* &quot;Gn&quot; is the rate of generation of electrons
* &quot;Rn&quot; is the rate of recombination of electrons

Similarly, for holes:
formula_27
where:
* &quot;p&quot; is the local concentration of holes
* formula_28 is hole mobility
* &quot;E&quot; is the electric field across the depletion region
* &quot;Dp&quot; is the diffusion coefficient for holes
* &quot;Gp&quot; is the rate of generation of holes
* &quot;Rp&quot; is the rate of recombination of holes

===Derivation===

This section presents a derivation of the equation above for electrons. A similar derivation can be found for the equation for holes.

Consider the fact that the number of electrons is conserved across a volume of semiconductor material with cross-sectional area, &quot;A&quot;, and length, &quot;dx&quot;, along the &quot;x&quot;-axis. More precisely, one can say:
formula_29

Mathematically, this equality can be written:
formula_30Here &quot;J&quot; denotes current density(whose direction is against electron flow by convention) due to electron flow within the considered volume of the semiconductor. It is also called electron current density.

Total electron current density is the sum of drift current and diffusion current densities:
formula_31

Therefore, we have
formula_32

Applying the product rule results in the final expression:
formula_33

===Solution===
The key to solving these equations in real devices is whenever possible to select regions in which most of the mechanisms are negligible so that the equations reduce to a much simpler form.

==Relativistic version==

===Special relativity===
The notation and tools of special relativity, especially 4-vectors and 4-gradients, offer a convenient way to write any continuity equation.

The density of a quantity and its current can be combined into a 4-vector called a 4-current:
formula_34
where is the speed of light. The 4-divergence of this current is:
formula_35
where is the 4-gradient and is an index labeling the spacetime dimension. Then the continuity equation is:
formula_36
in the usual case where there are no sources or sinks, that is, for perfectly conserved quantities like energy or charge. This continuity equation is manifestly (&quot;obviously&quot;) Lorentz invariant.

Examples of continuity equations often written in this form include electric charge conservation
formula_36
where is the electric 4-current; and energy–momentum conservation
formula_38
where is the stress–energy tensor.

===General relativity===
In general relativity, where spacetime is curved, the continuity equation (in differential form) for energy, charge, or other conserved quantities involves the &quot;covariant&quot; divergence instead of the ordinary divergence.

For example, the stress–energy tensor is a second-order tensor field containing energy–momentum densities, energy–momentum fluxes, and shear stresses, of a mass-energy distribution. The differential form of energy–momentum conservation in general relativity states that the &quot;covariant&quot; divergence of the stress-energy tensor is zero:
formula_39

This is an important constraint on the form the Einstein field equations take in general relativity.

However, the &quot;ordinary&quot; divergence of the stress–energy tensor does &quot;not&quot; necessarily vanish:
formula_40

The right-hand side strictly vanishes for a flat geometry only.

As a consequence, the &quot;integral&quot; form of the continuity equation is difficult to define and not necessarily valid for a region within which spacetime is significantly curved (e.g. around a black hole, or across the whole universe).

==Particle physics==

Quarks and gluons have &quot;color charge&quot;, which is always conserved like electric charge, and there is a continuity equation for such color charge currents (explicit expressions for currents are given at gluon field strength tensor).

There are many other quantities in particle physics which are often or always conserved: baryon number (proportional to the number of quarks minus the number of antiquarks), electron number, mu number, tau number, isospin, and others. Each of these has a corresponding continuity equation, possibly including source / sink terms.

==Noether&#x27;s theorem==

One reason that conservation equations frequently occur in physics is Noether&#x27;s theorem. This states that whenever the laws of physics have a continuous symmetry, there is a continuity equation for some conserved physical quantity. The three most famous examples are:

* The laws of physics are invariant with respect to time-translation—for example, the laws of physics today are the same as they were yesterday. This symmetry leads to the continuity equation for conservation of energy.
* The laws of physics are invariant with respect to space-translation—for example, a rocket in outer space is not subject to different forces or potentials if it is displaced in any given direction (eg. x, y, z), leading to the conservation of the three components of momentum conservation of momentum.
* The laws of physics are invariant with respect to orientation—for example, floating in outer space, there is no measurement you can do to say &quot;which way is up&quot;; the laws of physics are the same regardless of how you are oriented. This symmetry leads to the continuity equation for conservation of angular momentum.

<doc id="410801" wikidata="Q2665906" url="?curid=410801" title="Music of Armenia">
<text>The music of [[Armenia]] ( &quot;haykakan yerazhshtut’yun&quot;) has its origins in the Armenian highlands, dating back to the 3rd millennium BCE, and is a long-standing musical tradition that encompasses diverse secular and religious, or sacred, music (such as the &quot;sharakan&quot; Armenian chant and &quot;taghs&quot;, along with the indigenous &quot;khaz&quot; musical notation). Folk music was notably collected and transcribed by Komitas Vardapet, a prominent composer and musicologist, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who is also considered the founder of the modern Armenian national school of music. Armenian music has been presented internationally by numerous artists, such as composers Aram Khachaturian, Alexander Arutiunian, Arno Babajanian, Haig Gudenian, and Karen Kavaleryan as well as by traditional performers such as duduk player Djivan Gasparyan.

==Melodic basis==

Traditional Armenian folk music as well as Armenian church music is not based on the European tonal system but on a system of tetrachords. The last note of one tetrachord also serves as the first note of the next tetrachord – which makes a lot of Armenian folk music more or less based on a theoretically endless scale.

Khaz is an Armenian neume, one of a set of special signs (khazes) constituting the traditional system of musical notation that has been used to transcribe Armenian music (mostly religious Armenian music) since the 8th century.

==Folk music==
Armenia has had a long tradition of folk music since antiquity. During the Soviet era, Armenian folk music was taught in state-sponsored conservatoires. In 1978, influential kanon player and composer Khachatur Avetisyan founded the folk music department of the Komitas State Conservatory of Yerevan. Traditional instruments include the qamancha, kanon (box zither), dhol (double-headed hand drum, see davul), oud (lute), duduk, zurna, blul, sring, shvi, pku, parkapzuk, tar, dmblak, bambir, and to a lesser degree the saz. Other instruments often used include the violin and clarinet. The duduk is considered to be Armenia&#x27;s national instrument, and among its well-known performers are Margar Margaryan, Levon Madoyan, Vache Hovsepyan, Gevorg Dabaghyan, and Yeghish Manukyan, as well as Armenia&#x27;s most famous contemporary duduk player, Djivan Gasparyan.

Notable performers of folk music include vocalists such as Armenak Shahmuradyan, Ofelya Hambardzumyan, Vagharshak Sahakyan, Araksia Gyulzadyan, Varduhi Khachatryan, Norayr Mnatsakanyan, Hovhannes Badalyan, Hayrik Muradyan, Valya Samvelyan, Rima Saribekyan, Raffi Hovhannisyan, Avak Petrosyan, Papin Poghosyan, and Flora Martirosian.

There are also several Armenian folk ensembles, the Shoghaken Folk Ensemble, founded in 1995 in Yerevan, and others such as the Arev Armenian Folk Ensemble.

===Gusan and Ashugh art===
In ancient and medieval Armenia, the &quot;gusans&quot; () were the creative and performing artists – singers, instrumentalists, dancers, storytellers, and professional folk actors in public theaters. The word &quot;gusan&quot; is first mentioned in early Armenian texts of the 5th century AD, such as Faustus of Byzantium, Moses of Chorene, and others. In the early Middle Ages the word &quot;gusan&quot; was used as an equivalent to the classical Greek word &quot;mimos&quot; (mime). There were 2 groups of gusans: the first were from aristocratic dynasties (feudal lords) and performed as professional musicians; the second group comprised popular, but illiterate gusans.

The gusans were both criticized and praised, particularly in medieval Armenia. The adoption of Christianity had its influence upon Armenian minstrelsy, gradually altering its ethical and ideological orientation. The center of the gusans was the Goghtn &quot;gavar&quot; (canton), a region in the Vaspurakan province of Greater Armenia that bordered the province of Syunik.

During the late Middle Ages, gusans were succeeded by popular, semi-professional musicians called ashughs (), who played instruments like the kamancha and saz. Sayat-Nova, an 18th-century ashugh and poet, is revered in Armenia. Other Armenian ashughs include Jivani, Sheram, , , , and 

===Folk music in the Armenian diaspora===
Descendants of survivors of the Armenian genocide, originally from Western Armenia, and Armenian emigrants from other parts of the Middle East have settled in various countries, especially in the California Central Valley. The second- and third-generation artists, such as Richard Hagopian, an oud-player associated with the &quot;kef&quot; tradition of Armenian-American music have kept their folk traditions alive. This dance-oriented style of Armenian music, using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments (often electrified/amplified) and some Western instruments, preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia. Many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of cosmopolitan Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated (termed &quot;surjaran&quot; or &quot;café aman&quot;, meaning cafeteria), on the Eight Avenue of Manhattan, New York City. Bands such as the Vosbikian Band of Philadelphia were notable in the 1940s and 1950s for developing their own style of &quot;kef music&quot;, heavily influenced by the popular American big band jazz of the time. Another oud player, John Berberian, is notable in particular for his fusions of traditional music with rock and jazz in the 1960s.

In the Lebanese and Syrian diaspora, George Tutunjian, Karnig Sarkissian and others performed Armenian revolutionary songs, which quickly became popular among the Armenian Diaspora, notably ARF supporters. In Tehran, Iran, the folk music of the Armenian community is characterized by the work of Nikol Galanderian (1881–1946) and the Goghtan Choir.

===Hayrens===

Hayren is a form of traditional Armenian poetry. Hayrens are typically composed of four lines with each of the four lines containing 15 syllables. Each line divides into two half-lines that consist of seven and eight syllables. Some of this structure has been lost in translation, and the poems are best appreciated in the Armenian language. This form of poetry dates back to medieval Armenia and has been used by various poets and writers throughout history. The content of hayrens can vary, covering topics such as love, satire, or lessons in morality.

===Examples of Armenian folk music===
Armenian folk music often accompanies Armenian folk dances, which vary significantly across regions. Most of the folk songs/dances have ancient or medieval origins.

The most popular Armenian folk songs/dances are Kochari, Shalakho, Yarkhushta, Berd, Tamzara, Lorke, Sari Aghjik, and Uzundara.

Another example is Mokats Mirza, a medieval folk song.

==Religious music==
Armenian religious (or sacred) music, which is predominantly vocal, is one of the oldest branches of Christian culture, and was introduced after the Christianization of Armenia in 301 AD. Armenian chant, composed in one of eight modes, is the most common kind of religious music in Armenia. It is written in &quot;khaz&quot;, a form of indigenous musical notation. Many of these chants are ancient in origin, extending to pre-Christian times, while others are relatively modern, including several composed by Saint Mesrop Mashtots, who also invented the Armenian alphabet. Some of the best performers of these chants, or &quot;sharakan&quot;s, reside at the Holy Cathedral of Etchmiadzin, and include the late soprano Lusine Zakaryan.

Makar Yekmalyan (1856–1905) composed the &quot;Patarag&quot;, the setting of the Armenian Apostolic Church&#x27;s Divine Liturgy, which he completed in 1892 in several arrangements and was first published in Leipzig in 1896. This arrangement of the liturgy incorporated polyphonic and homophonic vocal parts into the structure of the Liturgy and saw it be notated in its entirety. This would influence the compositional approach of Komitas, who was Yekmalian&#x27;s student (along with the works of Kristapor Kara-Murza) and would also see him introduce polyphony with his version of the Liturgy at the end of the 19th century.

==Classical music==

Armenian classical composers of Ottoman classical music include Kemani Tatyos Ekserciyan (1858–1913), music theorist Hampartsoum Limondjian (1768–1839) who developed the influential &quot;Hamparsum&quot; notation system, and Bimen Şen Der Ghazarian (1873–1913).

Alexander Spendiarov (1871–1928), Armen Tigranian (1879–1950), and Haro Stepanian are best known for their Armenian operas. Sargis Barkhudaryan (1887–1973) and Garo Zakarian (1895–1967) are representative composers of the pre- and early Soviet Armenian era. The most famous, however, was Aram Khatchaturian (1903–1978), internationally well-known especially for his music for various ballets and the immortal &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; from his composition for the ballet &quot;Gayane&quot;. Gevorg Armenyan (1920–2005), Anahit Tsitsikian (1926–1999), Arno Babajanian (1921–1983), Barseg Kanatchian (1885–1967), Edward Mirzoyan (1921–2012), Boris Parsadanian (1925–1997), Ashot Zohrabyan (), Aram Satian (), and Vartan Adjemian () represent other Soviet-era Armenian composers. Iosif Andriasov&#x27;s (1933–2000) was an influential composer-symphonist, a moral philosopher, and a teacher. Alexander Arutiunian (1920–2012) is best known for his &quot;Trumpet Concerto in A-flat major&quot;. Alexander Dolukhanian (1910–1968) composed or arranged numerous Armenian songs, including the well-known &quot;Swallow&quot;. Alexander Adjemian (1925–1987), Ashot Satian (1906–1958) and Vagarshak Kotoyan (1921–1992) are known for their contributions to Armenian choral and vocal music. Eduard Abramian (1923–1986) wrote songs on the poetry of Armenian poets Hovhannes Tumanyan and Avetik Isahakian which are now part of the standard repertoire. Artemi Ayvazyan (1902–1975) wrote the first Soviet musical comedies, including the popular &quot;Dentist from the Orient&quot;. In recent years, Avet Terterian (1929–1994), Tigran Mansurian (), Vache Sharafyan () and Aram Petrosyan () have achieved global success. Another acclaimed, more recent, classical composer is Khachatur Avetissian (1926–1996), many of whose compositions are based on traditional folklore themes. Uruguayan-Armenian composer Coriún Aharonián (1940–2017), besides a notable body of avant-garde compositions has done extensive musicological and political work. The Armenian nationalist composer Alexander Kaloian () is known for his overtly nationalistic works for military band and orchestra including marches, tone poems and symphonies immediately recognizable as &quot;Armenian&quot; in their color.
In classical music, many Armenian singers have gained worldwide recognition: sopranos Gohar Gasparyan, Sona Ghazarian, Arpine Pehlivanian, Lucine Amara, Cathy Berberian and, more recently, Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan, mezzo-soprano Tatevik Sazandaryan, tenors Tigran Levonyan, Gegham Grigoryan, and Vahan Mirakyan; basses Ara Berberian, and Henrik Alaverdian, as well as the bass-baritone Barsegh Toumanian.

Cadence Ensemble is an Armenian musical ensemble formed in February 2004 by five classically trained musicians. Initially specialising on works by Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla, they later included a wider repertoire of American, Armenian, Russian and other European classical and contemporary classical music.

In the diaspora, Armenian musicians such as pianist Şahan Arzruni, violinists Manoug Parikian and Levon Chilingirian, and composers such as Alan Hovhaness have reached international fame.

Armenian-American composer John Hodian created &quot;Songs of Exile&quot;, new music based on poetry by the medieval Armenian painter, poet and priest Mkrtich Naghash. With three female vocalists, duduk, oud, dhol and piano, The Naghash Ensemble has been touring internationally since 2014. Their music has been described as a hybrid of &quot;classical music, jazz, folk and post-minimalism&quot; by the German radio station BR Klassik. Scott Giles () is an Armenian-American known for his many symphonies and concertos. Armenian-Canadian composer Vahram Sargsyan () represents the younger generation of Armenian contemporary composers who is mostly known for his choral compositions.

==Jazz==

The first jazz band of Yerevan was founded in 1936. Soviet jazz was developed by Armenians such as Artemi Ayvazyan, who founded the Armenian State Estrada Orchestra in 1938. Notable performers in the vocal genre have been: Georgi Minasian, Artashes Avetyan, and Levon Sevan, as well as the aforementioned Elvina Makaryan and Datevik Hovanesian. Tigran Hamasyan is a Gyumri-born contemporary jazz pianist who is strongly influenced by the Armenian folk tradition, often using its scales and modalities.

==Popular music==
===Pop music===
Armenian popular songs have been performed by famous Soviet-era performers such as Ruben Matevosyan, Ofelya Hambardzumyan, Varduhi Khachatryan, and Papin Poghosyan. Suzan Yakar and Udi Hrant Kenkulian were famous cabaret performers in Turkey during the 1920s and 1930s.

====Rabiz music====

Rabiz (), or rabis, is a genre of Armenian popular music and a subculture, distinguished by its lyrics and dance-oriented synthesized melodies in time signature with elements of Armenian folk music. Despite the term&#x27;s widespread use, the etymology or definition of the word &quot;rabiz&quot; is not clearly understood. According to some sources it stems from the Russian phrase &quot;работники искусства&quot; (rabotniki iskusstva) used during Soviet times, meaning &quot;Art Workers&quot;, in reference to unions which specialized in new music composition.

Played by musicians such as Tatul Avoyan and Hayk Ghevondyan (better known as Spitakci Hayko), rabiz music is also widely popular among by Armenian diasporan communities in Los Angeles and Russia. A subgenre of rabiz music, called &quot;kef&quot; (unrelated to the homonymous Armenian-American kef music), concerns romantic love or partying, but also love of family or patriotism.
Rabiz music has recently seen unexpected international commercial success, especially in Turkey, with &quot;Mi Gna&quot; by Armenian American rapper Super Sako, which features Hayk Ghevondyan, hitting No. 1 on a Shazam Top 100 list and its video garnering over 190 million views on YouTube.

===Rock===

Among the rock bands of the older generation were the Arakyalner (&quot;Apostles&quot;) of Arthur Meschian, Vostan Hayots, Ayas, and Arevatsaq. Contemporary Armenian rock bands include Sard, Bambir 2, Vordan Karmir, Dogma, Reincarnation, and alternative rock band The Beautified Project. Armenian Progressive Metal bands have also appeared in the Armenian music scene in recent Years with bands like Dorians (band), and Armenian Space Station.

===Hip hop===
Hip hop music in Armenia is popular primarily amongst the youth. One of the notable Armenian hip hop bands of the 2000s was Hay Tgheq (&quot;Հայ տղեք&quot; &quot;Armenian guys&quot;), founded in 2001. Following the band&#x27;s dissolution, members Misho and HT Hayko started their own solo careers. The most popular Armenian language hip hop song has been regarded as the 2006 song &quot;Qami Pchi&quot; by the now defunct group HAYQ, composed by Hayk Apricota ( Hayk Harutyunyan), produced by DerHova. In the diaspora, Glendale, California-based rapper R-Mean gained popularity amongst the Armenian community with the song &quot;Open Wounds,&quot; which commemorates the Armenian genocide, and started the movement &quot;Open Wounds 1915&quot;. Other Armenian rap groups were formed in Germany, such as Armenios, which was founded in Germany by A-Shot, ArmoX &amp; 15Volt. In the 2010s, Armenian-American rapper Super Sako&#x27;s aforementioned single &quot;Mi Gna&quot; achieved worldwide commercial success and was remixed in over 10 languages and by international artists, such as Maitre Gims (France), Balti (Morocco), and DJ Pantelis (Greece).

==Armenian musicians from the Diaspora==
There is a large number of musicians of Armenian descent or origin but living (or born) outside of Armenia.

In France, the artist Charles Aznavour (born Aznavourian), of Armenian descent, has been known for his shows and songs over the course of decades. System of a Down, an internationally popular alternative metal band from the United States, was formed by Daron Malakian, Serj Tankian, Shavo Odadjian and John Dolmayan, all of whom are of Armenian American descent.

==Armenian musical instruments: etymological origins==

The etymology of Armenian musical instrument names offers insights into the ancient linguistic and cultural exchanges that have shaped the Armenian lexicon. Armenian musical terminology draws from three primary linguistic layers:
Native Armenian Origins: Terms of Indo-European heritage or composed in Armenian from 5th–4th millennia BCE.
Late Indo-European and Mediterranean/European Substrate: Words adopted from neighboring cultures around the 3rd–2nd millennia BCE.
Loanwords from Neighboring Languages: Borrowed from languages such as Caucasian, Anatolian, Hurrian, Urartian, Semitic, and Iranian, dating from the 2nd–1st millennia BCE to the present.

===Instrument 1: knt–nt–ocʻ, knt–knt–ocʻ, ktnt–ocʻ (‘plectrum’)===
Historical Usage: In classical Armenian texts by Philo, Gregory of Nyssa, Anania, and Vardan Arewelcʻi, the term kntntocʻ described a &#x27;plectrum&#x27;, evolving in Modern Armenian to mean a &#x27;violin bow&#x27;.
Linguistic Analysis: Ačaṙyan attributed this term to the onomatopoeic sounds kn and tn. Jahukyan also treated it as onomatopoeic, viewing it as a reduplication.
Cross-Linguistic Comparison: This term appears similar to Baltic and Slavic roots, such as Lithuanian gaũsti and Slavic gǫsti, suggesting a shared origin or influence in ancient Eurasian languages.

===Instrument 2: ǰnar (‘lyre, harp, cithara’)===
Historical Context and Usage: Used in ancient Armenian literature (such as Severian of Gabala and Grigor Narekac‘i), ǰnar denotes various stringed instruments.
Possible Hattic and Greek Origins: Some scholars link ǰnar to the Hattic zinar–, while others propose a connection to Greek κιθάρα (lyre). This could indicate a Mediterranean–Pontic cultural loanword, stemming from a theoretical proto-form ghindhara.
Related Words: The Armenian k‘nar is similarly associated with Semitic terms like Aramaic kinnārā and Hebrew kinnōr, possibly indicating a cultural and linguistic exchange through Iranian intermediaries.

===Instrument 3: sruil (‘musical instrument’)===
Historical Usage: The term sruil appears in texts by Ephrem the Syrian.
Etymology and Linguistic Challenges: Originally derived from the Indo-European su̯er– (to resound), the word poses phonological challenges. Alternative theories suggest an Iranian root, possibly related to the Iranian word for &#x27;horn&#x27; (sruuā– in Avestan).
Related Terms: The term sruak (&#x27;vial&#x27; or &#x27;cruet&#x27;) in Armenian might also derive from an Iranian source, showing the influence of neighboring cultures on Armenian musical vocabulary.

<doc id="410804" wikidata="Q1960297" url="?curid=410804" title="Hindsight bias">
<text>Hindsight bias, also known as the knew-it-all-along phenomenon or creeping determinism, is the common tendency for people to perceive past events as having been more predictable than they were.

After an event has occurred, people often believe that they could have predicted or perhaps even known with a high degree of certainty what the outcome of the event would be before it occurred. Hindsight bias may cause distortions of memories of what was known or believed before an event occurred and is a significant source of overconfidence in one’s ability to predict the outcomes of future events. Examples of hindsight bias can be seen in the writings of historians describing the outcomes of battles, in physicians’ recall of clinical trials, and in criminal or civil trials as people tend to assign responsibility on the basis of the supposed predictability of accidents.

In some countries, 20/20 indicates normal visual acuity at 20 feet, from which derives the idiom &quot;hindsight is 20/20&quot;.

== History ==

The hindsight bias, although it was not yet named, was not a new concept when it emerged in psychological research in the 1970s. In fact, it had been indirectly described numerous times by historians, philosophers, and physicians. In 1973, Baruch Fischhoff attended a seminar where Paul E. Meehl stated an observation: clinicians often overestimate their ability to have foreseen the outcome of a particular case, claiming they knew it all along. Baruch, a psychology graduate student at the time, saw an opportunity in psychological research to explain this tendency.

In the early 70s, the investigation of heuristics and biases was a large area of study in psychology, led by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman. Two heuristics identified by Tversky and Kahneman were of immediate importance in the development of the hindsight bias; these were the availability heuristic and the representativeness heuristic.

In an elaboration of these heuristics, Beyth and Fischhoff devised the first experiment directly testing the hindsight bias. They asked participants to judge the likelihood of several outcomes of US president Richard Nixon&#x27;s upcoming visit to Beijing and Moscow. Some time after president Nixon&#x27;s return, participants were asked to recall (or reconstruct) the probabilities they had assigned to each possible outcome, and their perceptions of the likelihood of each outcome were greater or overestimated for events that had occurred. This study is frequently referred to in definitions of the hindsight bias, and the title of the paper, &quot;I knew it would happen,&quot; may have contributed to the hindsight bias being interchangeable with the phrase, &quot;knew-it-all-along phenomenon&quot;.

In 1975, Fischhoff developed another method for investigating the hindsight bias, which was, at the time, referred to as the &quot;creeping determinism hypothesis&quot;. This method involves giving participants a short story with four possible outcomes, one of which they are told is true, and are then asked to assign the likelihood of each particular outcome. Participants frequently assign a higher likelihood of occurrence to whichever outcome they have been told is true. Remaining relatively unmodified, this method is still used in psychological and behavioural experiments investigating aspects of the hindsight bias. Having evolved from the heuristics of Tversky and Kahneman into the creeping determinism hypothesis and finally into the hindsight bias as we now know it, the concept has many practical applications and is still at the forefront of research today. Recent studies involving the hindsight bias have investigated the effect age has on the bias, , and how it may affect banking and investment strategies.

==Factors==
===Outcome valence and intensity===

Hindsight bias is more likely to occur when the outcome of an event is negative rather than positive. This is a phenomenon consistent with the general tendency for people to pay more attention to negative outcomes of events than positive outcomes.

In addition, hindsight bias is affected by the severity of the negative outcome. In malpractice lawsuits, it has been found that the more severe a negative outcome is, the juror&#x27;s hindsight bias is more dramatic. In a perfectly objective case, the verdict would be based on the physician&#x27;s standard of care instead of the outcome of the treatment; however, studies show that cases ending in severe negative outcomes (such as death) result in a higher level of hindsight bias.

For example, in 1996, LaBine proposed a scenario where a psychiatric patient told a therapist that he was contemplating harming another individual. The therapist did not warn the other individual of the possible danger. Participants were each given one of three possible outcomes; the threatened individual either received no injuries, minor injuries, or serious injuries. Participants were then asked to determine if the physician should be considered negligent. Participants in the &quot;serious injuries&quot; condition were not only more likely to rate the therapist as negligent but also rated the attack as more foreseeable. Participants in the no injuries and minor injury categories were more likely to see the therapist&#x27;s actions as reasonable.

===Surprise===

The role of surprise can help explain the malleability of hindsight bias. Surprise influences how the mind reconstructs pre-outcome predictions in three ways:
1. Surprise is a direct metacognitive heuristic to estimate the distance between outcome and prediction.
2. Surprise triggers a deliberate sense-making process.
3. Surprise biases this process ( the malleability of hindsight bias) by enhancing the recall of surprise-congruent information and expectancy-based hypothesis testing.

Pezzo&#x27;s sense-making model supports two contradicting ideas of a surprising outcome. The results can show a lesser hindsight bias or possibly a reversed effect, where the individual believes the outcome was not a possibility at all. The outcome can also lead to the hindsight bias being magnified to have a stronger effect. The sense-making process is triggered by an initial surprise. If the sense-making process is not complete and the sensory information is not detected or coded [by the individual], the sensation is experienced as a surprise and the hindsight bias has a gradual reduction. When the sense-making process is lacking, the phenomena of reversed hindsight bias is created. Without the sense-making process being present, there is no remnant of thought about the surprise. This can lead to a sensation of not believing the outcome as a possibility.

===Personality===

Along with the emotion of surprise, the personality traits of an individual affect hindsight bias. A new C model is an approach to figure out the bias and accuracy in human inferences because of their individual personality traits. This model integrates accurate personality judgments and hindsight effects as a by-product of knowledge updating.

During the study, three processes showed potential to explain the occurrence of hindsight effects in personality judgments:
1. Changes in an individual&#x27;s cue perceptions,
2. Changes in the use of more valid cues, and
3. Changes in the consistency with which an individual applies cue knowledge.

After two studies, it was clear that there were hindsight effects for each of the Big Five personality dimensions. Evidence was found that both the utilization of more valid cues and changes in cue perceptions of the individual, but not changes in the consistency with which cue knowledge is applied, account for the hindsight effects. During both of these studies, participants were presented with target pictures and were asked to judge each target&#x27;s levels of the Big Five personality traits.

In a study of 75 participants, researchers tested 10 personalities about hindsight bias.  This study conducted three comparisons of hindsight estimation with foresight estimation (memory conditioning), hindsight estimation with forward estimation with other participants, and hindsight estimation with foresight estimation. The participants in these comparisons all Demonstrated hindsight bias.  Personality measures cannot account for memory hindsight in multiple regression analysis. Hindsight in individual differences is present but must be accounted for in the full effect model.

===Age===

It is more difficult to test for hindsight bias in children than adults because the verbal methods used in experiments on adults are too complex for children to understand, let alone measure bias. Some experimental procedures have been created with visual identification to test children about their hindsight bias in a way they can grasp. Methods with visual images start by presenting a blurry image to the child that becomes clearer over time. In some conditions, the subjects know what the final object is and in others they do not. In cases where the subject knows what the object shape will become when the image is clear, they are asked to estimate the amount of time other participants of similar age will take to guess what the object is. Due to hindsight bias, the estimated times are often much lower than the actual times. This is because the participant is using their personal knowledge while making their estimate.

These types of studies show that children are also affected by hindsight bias. Adults and children with hindsight bias share the core cognitive constraint of being biased to one&#x27;s current knowledge while, at the same time, attempting to recall or reason about a more naïve cognitive state—regardless of whether the more naïve state is one&#x27;s earlier naïve state or someone else&#x27;s.

===Auditory hindsight bias===

Hindsight bias also affects human communications. To test auditory hindsight bias, four experiments were completed. 
Experiment one included plain words, in which low-pass filters were used to reduce the amplitude for sounds of consonants; thus making the words more degraded. In the naïve-identification task, participants were presented a warning tone before hearing the degraded words. In the hindsight estimation task, a warning tone was presented before the clear word followed by the degraded version of the word. 
Experiment two included words with explicit warnings of hindsight bias. It followed the same procedure as experiment one. However, the participants were informed and asked not to complete the same error. 
Experiment three included full sentences of degraded words rather than individual words. Experiment four included less-degraded words in order to make the words easier to understand and identify to the participants.

By using these different techniques, this offered a different range of detection and also evaluated the ecological validity of the experiment&#x27;s effect. In each experiment, the hindsight estimates of the percentage that their naïve peers can correctly identify the words, all exceed the actual percentages. Therefore, knowing the identities of words caused people to overestimate others&#x27; naïve ability to identify moderately to highly degraded spoken versions of those words. People who know the outcome of an event tend to overestimate their prior knowledge or others&#x27; naïve knowledge of the event. As a result, speakersknowing what is being communicatedtend to overestimate the clarity of their message while listenershearing what they want to heartend to overestimate their understanding of ambiguous messages. This miscommunication stems from hindsight bias which then creates a feeling of inevitability. Overall, this auditory hindsight bias occurs despite people&#x27;s effort to avoid it.

===Cognitive models===

To understand how a person can so easily change the foundation of knowledge and belief for events after receiving new information, three cognitive models of hindsight bias have been reviewed. 
The three models are:
* SARA (Selective Activation and Reconstructive Anchoring), 
* RAFT (reconstruction after feedback with take the best), and 
* CMT (causal model theory). 
SARA and RAFT focus on distortions or changes in a memory process, while CMT focuses on probability judgments of hindsight bias.

The SARA model, created by Rüdiger Pohl and associates, explains hindsight bias for descriptive information in memory and hypothetical situations. Memory design is when the participants make foresight judgements, and then recall them in hindsight. Hypothetical design is when participants make hindsight judgements as if they had not known the outcome. SARA assumes that people have a set of images to draw their memories from. They suffer from the hindsight bias due to of that set of images.

Basically, people only remember small, select amounts of information—and when asked to recall it later, use that biased image to support their opinions about the situation. The set of images is originally processed in the brain when first experienced. When remembered, this image reactivates, and the mind can edit and alter the memory, which takes place in hindsight bias when new and correct information is presented, leading one to believe that this new information, when remembered at a later time, is the person&#x27;s original memory. Due to this reactivation in the brain, there may be permanent changes to the existing memory trace. The new information acts as a memory anchor causing retrieval impairment.

The RAFT model explains hindsight bias with comparisons of objects. It uses knowledge-based probability and then applies interpretations to those probabilities. When given two choices, a person recalls the information on both topics and makes assumptions based on how reasonable they find the information. An example case is someone comparing the size of two cities. If they know one city well (e.g. because it has a popular sporting team or through personal history) and know much less about the other, their mental cues for the more popular city increase. They then &quot;take the best&quot; option in their assessment of their probabilities. For example, they recognize a city due to knowing its sports team, and thus they assume that that city has the highest population. &quot;Take the best&quot; refers to a cue that is viewed as most valid and becomes support for the person&#x27;s interpretations. RAFT is a by-product of adaptive learning. Feedback information updates a person&#x27;s knowledge base. This can lead a person to be unable to retrieve the initial information because the information cue has been replaced by a cue that they thought was more fitting. The &quot;best&quot; cue has been replaced, and the person only remembers the answer that is most likely and believes they thought this was the best point the whole time.

Both SARA and RAFT descriptions include a memory trace impairment or cognitive distortion that is caused by the feedback of information and reconstruction of memory.

CMT is a non-formal theory based on work by many researchers to create a collaborative process model for hindsight bias that involves event outcomes. People try to make sense of an event that has not turned out how they expected by creating causal reasoning for the starting event conditions. This can give that person the idea that the event outcome was inevitable and there was nothing that could take place to prevent it from happening. CMT can be caused by a discrepancy between a person&#x27;s expectation of the event and the reality of an outcome. They consciously want to make sense of what has happened and selectively retrieve memory that supports the current outcome. This causal attribution can be motivated by wanting to feel more positive about the outcome and possibly themselves.

===Memory distortions===

Hindsight bias has similarities to other memory distortions, such as misinformation effect and false autobiographical memory. Misinformation effect occurs after an event is witnessed; new information received after the fact influences how the person remembers the event, and can be called post-event misinformation. This is an important issue with eyewitness testimony. False autobiographical memory takes place when suggestions or additional outside information is provided to distort and change memory of events; this can also lead to false memory syndrome. At times this can lead to the creation of new memories that are completely false and have not taken place.

All three of these memory distortions contain a three-stage procedure. The details of each procedure are different, but all three can result in some form of psychological manipulation and alteration of memory. Stage one is different between the three paradigms, although all involve an event, an event that has taken place (misinformation effect), an event that has not taken place (false autobiographical memory), and a judgement made by a person about an event that must be remembered (hindsight bias). Stage two consists of more information that is received by the person after the event has taken place. The new information given in hindsight bias is correct and presented upfront to the person, while the extra information for the other two memory distortions is wrong and presented in an indirect and possibly manipulative way. The third stage consists of recalling the starting information. The person must recall the original information with hindsight bias and misinformation effect, while a person that has a false autobiographical memory is expected to remember the incorrect information as a true memory.

Cavillo (2013) tested whether there is a relationship between the amount of time the people performing the experiment gave the participants to respond and the participant&#x27;s level of bias when recalling their initial judgements. The results showed that there is in fact a relationship; the hindsight bias index was greater among the participants who were asked to respond more rapidly than among the participants who were allowed more time to respond.

Distortions of autobiographical memory produced by hindsight bias have also been used as a tool to study changes in students&#x27; beliefs about paranormal phenomena after taking a university level skepticism course. In a study by Kane (2010), students in Kane&#x27;s skepticism class rated their level of belief in a variety of paranormal phenomena at both the beginning and at the end of the course. At the end of the course, they also rated what they remembered their level of belief had been at the beginning of the course. The critical finding was that not only did students reduce their average level of belief in paranormal phenomena by the end of the course, but they also falsely remembered the level of belief they held at the beginning of the course, recalling a much lower level of belief than what they had initially rated. It is the latter finding that is a reflection of the operation of hindsight bias.

To create a false autobiographical memory, the person must believe a memory that is not real. To seem real, the information must be influenced by their personal judgments. There is no real episode of an event to remember, so this memory construction must be logical to that person&#x27;s knowledge base. Hindsight bias and the misinformation effect recall a specific time and event; this is called an episodic memory process. These two memory distortions both use memory-based mechanisms that involve a memory trace that has been changed. Hippocampus activation takes place when an episodic memory is recalled. The memory is then available for alteration by new information. The person believes that the recalled information is the original memory trace, not an altered memory. This new memory is made from accurate information, and, therefore, the person does not have much motivation to admit that they were wrong originally by remembering the original memory. This can lead to motivated forgetting.

===Motivated forgetting===

Following a negative outcome of a situation, people do not want to accept responsibility. Instead of accepting their role in the event, they might either view themselves as caught up in a situation that was unforeseeable with them therefore not being the culprits (this is referred to as defensive processing) or view the situation as inevitable with there therefore being nothing that could have been done to prevent it (this is retroactive pessimism). Defensive processing involves less hindsight bias, as they are playing ignorant of the event. Retroactive pessimism makes use of hindsight bias after a negative, unwanted outcome. Events in life can be hard to control or predict. It is no surprise that people want to view themselves in a more positive light and do not want to take responsibility for situations they could have altered. This leads to hindsight bias in the form of retroactive pessimism to inhibit upward counterfactual thinking, instead interpreting the outcome as succumbing to an inevitable fate.

This memory inhibition that prevents a person from recalling what happened may lead to failure to accept mistakes, and therefore may make someone unable to learn and grow to prevent repeating the mistake. Hindsight bias can also lead to overconfidence in decisions without considering other options. Such people see themselves as persons who remember correctly, even though they are just forgetting that they were wrong. Avoiding responsibility is common among the human population. Examples are discussed below to show the regularity and severity of hindsight bias in society.

==Consequences==
Hindsight bias has both positive and negative consequences. The bias also plays a role in the process of decision-making within the medical field.

===Positive===
Positive consequences of hindsight bias is an increase in one&#x27;s confidence and performance, as long as the bias distortion is reasonable and does not create overconfidence. Another positive consequence is that one&#x27;s self-assurance of their knowledge and decision-making, even if it ends up being a poor decision, can be beneficial to others; allowing others to experience new things or to learn from those who made the poor decisions.

===Negative===
Hindsight bias causes overconfidence in one&#x27;s performance relative to others. Hindsight bias decreases one&#x27;s rational thinking because of when a person experiences strong emotions, which in turn decreases rational thinking. Another negative consequence of hindsight bias is the interference of one&#x27;s ability to learn from experience, as a person is unable to look back on past decisions and learn from mistakes. A third consequence is a decrease in sensitivity toward a victim by the person who caused the wrongdoing. The person demoralizes the victim and does not allow for a correction of behaviors and actions.

===Medical decision-making===
Hindsight bias may lead to overconfidence and malpractice in regards to physicians. Hindsight bias and overconfidence is often attributed to the number of years of experience the physician has. After a procedure, physicians may have a &quot;knew it the whole time&quot; attitude, when in reality they may not have known it. Medical decision support systems are designed to assist physicians in diagnosis and treatment, and have been suggested as a way to counteract hindsight bias. However, these decision support systems come with drawbacks, as going against a recommended decision resulted in more punitive jury outcomes when physicians were found liable for causing harm.

==Visual hindsight bias==

Hindsight bias has also been found to affect judgments regarding the perception of visual stimuli, an effect referred to as the &quot;I saw it all along&quot; phenomenon. This effect has been demonstrated experimentally by presenting participants with initially very blurry images of celebrities. Participants then viewed the images as the images resolved to full clarity (Phase 1). Following Phase 1, participants predicted the level of blur at which a peer would be able to make an accurate identification of each celebrity. It was found that, now that the identity of the celebrities in each image was known, participants significantly overestimated the ease with which others would be able to identify the celebrities when the images were blurry.

The phenomenon of visual hindsight bias has important implications for a form of malpractice litigation that occurs in the field of radiology. Typically, in these cases, a radiologist is charged with having failed to detect the presence of an abnormality that was present in a radiology image. During litigation, a different radiologist – who now knows that the image contains an abnormality – is asked to judge how likely it would be for a naive radiologist to have detected the abnormality during the initial reading of the image. This kind of judgement directly parallels the judgments made in hindsight bias studies. Consistent with the hindsight bias literature, it has been found that abnormalities are, in fact, more easily detected in hindsight than foresight. In the absence of controls for hindsight bias, testifying radiologists may overestimate the ease with which the abnormality would have been detected in foresight.

==Attempts to reduce hindsight bias==
Research suggests that people still exhibit the hindsight bias even when they are aware of it or possess the intention of eradicating it. There is no solution to eliminate hindsight bias in its totality, but only ways to reduce it. Some of these include considering alternative explanations or opening one&#x27;s mind to different perspectives. The only observable way to decrease hindsight bias in testing is to have the participant think about how alternative hypotheses could be correct. As a result, the participant would doubt the correct hypothesis and report not having chosen it.

Given that researchers&#x27; attempts to eliminate hindsight bias have failed, some believe there is a possible combination of motivational and automatic processes in cognitive reconstruction. Incentive prompts participants to use more effort to recover even the weak memory traces. This idea supports the causal model theory and the use of sense-making to understand event outcomes.

== Individual differences ==
A multinomial processing tree (MPT) model was used to identify processes underlying the phenomenon of hindsight bias (HB). A 2015 study extended HB by incorporating individual differences in cognitive function into estimates of core parameters of the model for older and younger adults, the MPT model.  The findings suggest that (1) in the absence of outcome knowledge, better episodic memory is associated with higher recall, (2) Better episodic memory and inhibitory control and higher working memory abilities were associated with higher recall abilities in the presence of knowledge of the outcome, (3) Better inhibitory control is associated with less reconstruction bias. Despite a similar pattern of effects in young adults, cognitive covariates did not significantly predict the underlying HB process in this age group.  Overall, the findings of this study suggest that working memory capacity and inhibitory control contribute to individual differences in recall bias and reconstruction bias, respectively, especially in older adults.

==Mental illness==

===Schizophrenia===
Schizophrenia is an example of a disorder that directly affects the hindsight bias. Individuals with schizophrenia are more strongly affected by the hindsight bias than are individuals from the general public.

The hindsight bias effect is a paradigm that demonstrates how recently acquired knowledge influences the recollection of past information. Recently acquired knowledge has a strange but strong influence on schizophrenic individuals in relation to information previously learned. New information combined with rejection of memories can disconfirm behavior and delusional belief, which is typically found in patients with schizophrenia. This can cause faulty memory, which can lead to hindsight thinking and believing in knowing something they do not. Delusion-prone individuals with schizophrenia can falsely jump to conclusions. Jumping to conclusions can lead to hindsight, which strongly influences the delusional conviction in individuals with schizophrenia. In numerous studies, cognitive functional deficits in schizophrenic individuals impair their ability to represent and uphold contextual processing.

===Post-traumatic stress disorder===
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the re-experiencing and avoidance of trauma-related stressors, emotions, and memories from a past event or events that has cognitive dramatizing impact on an individual. PTSD can be attributed to the functional impairment of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) structure. Dysfunctions of cognitive processing of context and abnormalities that PTSD patients often have can affect hindsight thinking, such as in combat soldiers perceiving they could have altered outcomes of events in war. The PFC and dopamine systems are parts of the brain that can be responsible for the impairment in cognitive control processing of context information. The PFC is well known for controlling the thought process in hindsight bias that something will happen when it evidently does not. Brain impairment in certain brain regions can also affect the thought process of an individual who may engage in hindsight thinking.

Cognitive flashbacks and other associated features from a traumatic event can trigger severe stress and negative emotions such as unpardonable guilt. For example, studies were done on trauma-related guilt characteristics of war veterans with chronic PTSD. Although there has been limited research, significant data suggests that hindsight bias has an effect on war veterans&#x27; personal perception of wrongdoing, in terms of guilt and responsibility from traumatic events of war. They blame themselves, and, in hindsight, perceive that they could have prevented what happened.

==Examples==
===Healthcare system===
Accidents are prone to happen in any human undertaking, but accidents occurring within the healthcare system seem more salient and severe because of their profound effect on the lives of those involved and sometimes result in the death of a patient. In the healthcare system, there are a number of methods in which specific cases of accidents that happened are being reviewed by others who already know the outcome of the case. Those methods include morbidity and mortality conferences, autopsies, case analysis, medical malpractice claims analysis, staff interviews, and even patient observation. Hindsight bias has been shown to cause difficulties in measuring errors in these cases. Many of the errors are considered preventable after the fact, which clearly indicates the presence and the importance of a hindsight bias in this field. There are two sides in the debate in how these case reviews should be approached to best evaluate past cases: the error elimination strategy and the safety management strategy. The error elimination strategy aims to find the cause of errors, relying heavily on hindsight (therefore more subject to the hindsight bias). The safety management strategy relies less on hindsight (less subject to hindsight bias) and identifies possible constraints during the decision-making process of that case. However, it is not immune to error.

===Judicial system===
Hindsight bias results in being held to a higher standard in court. The defense is particularly susceptible to these effects since their actions are the ones being scrutinized by the jury. The hindsight bias causes defendants to be judged as capable of preventing the bad outcome. Although much stronger for the defendants, hindsight bias also affects the plaintiffs. In cases that there is an assumption of risk, hindsight bias may contribute to the jurors perceiving the event as riskier because of the poor outcome. That may lead the jury to feel that the plaintiff should have exercised greater caution in the situation. Both effects can be minimized if attorneys put the jury in a position of foresight, rather than hindsight, through the use of language and timelines. Judges and juries are likely to mistakenly view negative events as being more foreseeable than what it was in the moment when they look at the situation after the fact in court. Encouraging people to explicitly think about the counterfactuals was an effective means of reducing the hindsight bias. In other words, people became less attached to the actual outcome and were more open to consider alternative lines of reasoning prior to the event. Judges involved in fraudulent transfer litigation cases were subject to the hindsight bias as well and resulted in an unfair advantage for the plaintiff, showing that jurors are not the only ones sensitive to the effects of the hindsight bias in the courtroom.

===Wikipedia===
Since hindsight leads people to focus on information that is consistent with what happened while inconsistent information is ignored or regarded as less relevant, it is likely included in representations about the past as well. In a study of Wikipedia articles the latest article versions before the event (foresight article versions) were compared to two hindsight article versions: the first online after the event took place and another one eight weeks later. To be able to investigate various types of events, even including disasters (such as the nuclear disaster at Fukushima), for which foresight articles do not exist, the authors made use of articles about the structure that suffered damage in those instances (such as the article about the nuclear power plant of Fukushima). When analyzing to what extent the articles were suggestive of a particular event, they found only articles about disasters to be much more suggestive of the disaster in hindsight than in foresight, which indicated hindsight bias. For the remaining event categories, however, Wikipedia articles did not show any hindsight bias. In an attempt to compare individuals&#x27; and Wikipedia&#x27;s hindsight bias more directly, another study came to the conclusion that Wikipedia articles are less susceptible to hindsight bias than individuals&#x27; representations.

=== Economy and business ===
Financial bubbles are often heavily biased with hindsight after they burst. After the worldwide dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and the Great Recession of 2008, many economists have suggested that conditions that seemed insignificant at the time were harbingers of future financial collapse. According to economist Richard Thaler, executives and entrepreneurs are particularly prone to hindsight bias. For example, in one study, more than 75% of entrepreneurs whose startups eventually failed predicted that their businesses would succeed. However, when asked again after their startup failed, only 58% said they had originally believed their startup would be a success. Hindsight bias can also contribute to startup failure through biased performance evaluations and overentry into competition. Hindsight-biased performance evaluation is also related to inefficient delegation. Additionally, hindsight bias affects judgment of business cases in court. A study by Strohmeier et al. (2020) found, that professional legal investigators (such as judges, lawyers and bankers with legal background) are perceptible to hindsight bias when judging the foreseeability of bankruptcy and assessing the legal responsibility of the CEO. Participants were presented with one of three hypothetical bankruptcy cases, which contained either no statement about the ending of the case, a positive outcome or a negative outcome. Depending on the presented ending, judgements about whether the CEO was to blame and about the possibility to predict the outcome, were significantly different. This can possibly result in an unjustifiably stricter judgement of bankruptcy cases in real life scenarios. 

=== Investment industry ===
Hindsight bias influences the decisions of investors in the investment sector. Investors tend to be overconfident in predicting the future because we mistakenly believe that we have predicted the present in the past, so we assume that the future will follow our predictions. Overconfidence is the killer for investment returns. Biais et al. show that hindsight bias allows people to underestimate the magnitude of volatility and that investment agents with hindsight bias have worse investment return performance. Research suggests that the main cause of hindsight bias is that no investor can remember how they made their decisions at the time. Therefore, in order to invest more rationally and safely, investors should keep a diary of the influences, outcomes and show why those outcomes were achieved when making their investment decisions. However, the diary approach largely prevents investors from forgetting conditions that have led to insight bias and overconfidence. The process of writing down the investment approach still leads to overconfidence, but the study found that it does not have an overall negative effect on current returns.

<text>Newlyn () is a seaside town and fishing port in south-west Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is the largest fishing port in England.

Newlyn lies on the shore of Mount&#x27;s Bay and forms a small conurbation with the neighbouring town of Penzance. It is part of the Penzance civil parish. The principal industry is fishing, although there are also a variety of yachts and pleasure boats in the harbour, as Newlyn has become a popular holiday destination with pubs and restaurants. Although the parish is now listed under Penzance, there is an electoral ward in separate existence called Mousehole, Newlyn and St Buryan. The population as of the 2011 census was 4,432.

==Toponymy==
The settlement is recorded as &quot;Nulyn&quot; in 1279 and as &quot;Lulyn&quot; in 1290, and the name is thought to be derived from the Cornish for &quot;pool for a fleet of boats&quot; which is thought to refer to the shallows offshore known as &quot;Gwavas Lake&quot;, traditionally the principal mooring for the fishing fleet in the area.

==History==
Before the rise of Newlyn as an important settlement the landing rights and most properties within the Newlyn area were owned by the Manor of Alverton. Newlyn&#x27;s history has been strongly linked to its role as a major fishing port. The natural protection afforded by the Gwavas Lake (an area of seawater in Mount&#x27;s Bay) led to many local fishermen using this area as a preferred landing site.

The Spanish Raid of 1595 destroyed Penzance, Mousehole and Paul as well as Newlyn.

In 1620 the Mayflower stopped off at Newlyn old quay to take on water. A plaque on the quay reads:
In 1755, the Lisbon earthquake caused a tsunami to strike the Cornish coast more than away from the epicentre. The sea rose in ten minutes at Newlyn, and ebbed at the same rate. The 19th-century French writer, Arnold Boscowitz, claimed that &quot;great loss of life and property occurred upon the coasts of Cornwall&quot;.

Before the 19th century, &quot;Newlyn&quot; referred only to the area near the old quay. The part of the village that now contains the fish market was known as &quot;Streetanowan&quot;, this was separated at high tide from &quot;Newlyn Town&quot; the site of the lower part of the modern harbour being reclaimed land and formerly a beach. In fact Newlyn comprises three discrete hamlets all previously separated by bodies of water, being Tolcarne (Tal Carn: Brow of the Rocks), Street-an-owan (Street-an-Owan: Oxen Street) and Trewarveneth (Farm/Manor on the Hill).

Newlyn (like Mousehole) was part of the ancient parish of Paul. It was common for villagers to climb the relatively steep route from &quot;Newlyn Cliff&quot; to Paul via the area which is now known as Gwavas to worship at Paul Church. Until the mid-20th century an ancient stone cross was present on this route at &quot;Park an Grouse&quot; (The Field of the Cross), this cross was one site of veneration of the Cornish sea deity Bucca, (others were the beaches of Newlyn and Mousehole) the name &#x27;Bucca&#x27; has often been used as a nickname for people who reside in Newlyn: the location of the cross is now unknown.
In 1851 Newlyn became the separate ecclesiastical parish of Newlyn St Peter. The church of St Peter was built in the Early English style in 1859–66. The interior is embellished with various works of art including the altarpiece and a statue of the Madonna and Child (by the then vicar the Rev. Allan G. Wyon). &quot;The ensemble is an outstanding example of Anglo-Catholic embellishment of the period [1936–55]&quot; (Peter Beacham). Father Wyon was the vicar from 1936 until his retirement in 1955. There is a Cornish cross by the road near the churchyard; it was found at Trereiffe about 1870 and much later placed near the church by the Rev. W. S. Lach-Szyrma.

In the 1880s a number of artists moved to the town and formed an artists&#x27; colony. The painters of Newlyn came to be known as the Newlyn School.

In 1896 Newlyn was the scene of the Newlyn riots following protests over the landing of fish on a Sunday by fishermen from the North of England, the local Cornish fishermen being members of the Methodist church and as such strong supporters of sabbatarianism.
From 1915, the Ordnance Survey tidal observatory was established in the harbour and for the next six years measurements of tidal height were taken every 15 minutes. This tidal gauge data was used to calculate the mean sea level at Newlyn, &quot;Ordnance Datum Newlyn&quot;, which became the vertical datum the Ordnance Survey uses to map altitudes throughout Great Britain.

In 1937, the fishing vessel Rosebud sailed to London to deliver a petition to the Minister of Health on behalf of those villagers whose homes were threatened under the government&#x27;s slum clearance scheme.

During the Second World War Newlyn was a base for the Air Sea Rescue craft covering the Western Approaches. The harbour was bombed during the war, hitting the collier &quot;Greenhithe&quot;, which was beached in the harbour at the time and supplied coal to the east coast drifters, which travelled to Newlyn during the mackerel fishing season between the wars. Reporting the event on the &quot;Germany Calling&quot; propaganda broadcast Lord Haw-Haw announced that the Luftwaffe had sunk a British cruiser in Newlyn Harbour.

The 2014 LP &quot;Cornish Pop Songs&quot; by indie band the &quot;Hit Parade&quot; contains several songs referencing Newlyn fishing industry including &quot;The Ghost of the Fishing Fleet&quot;, a comment on the declining investment in the area, neglect by central government and the recent influx in tourist trade.

===Newlyn and the Cornish language===
Newlyn, along with nearby Mousehole and Paul, was the last stronghold of the Cornish language, presumably due to the strength of its fishing fleet. William Gwavas, James Jenkins, Nicholas Boson, Thomas Boson, John Boson, John Keigwin, and John Kelynack Jnr had roots in or strong links with the district. Subsequently, several antiquarians including Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte, Daines Barrington, Georg Sauerwein and Henry Jenner who all collected Cornish writings or sayings, and the latter two became proficient in its use.

===Local government===
In 1894 Newlyn became part of Paul Urban District, while Tolcarne on the eastern side of the stream was in Madron Urban District. The urban districts were abolished in 1934 and Newlyn and Tolcarne were absorbed into the municipal borough of Penzance. Penzance Municipal Borough was itself abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and Newlyn became part of the new Penwith District. The former borough was unparished until 1980. The unparished area was formed into a civil parish in 1980, and the new Penzance parish council chose to call itself a town council. Newlyn returns five councillors to Penzance Town Council. Penwith District was abolished in 2009, and Newlyn now falls under the unitary Cornwall Council, with the town being shared between two divisions, Penzance Promenade in the east and Newlyn and Mousehole in the west. Since 2021, the town has been part of the new Mousehole, Newlyn and St Buryan division.

==Geography==
Newlyn is located in western Cornwall, just south of Penzance. It lies along the B3315 road which connects it to Land&#x27;s End. Paul and Mousehole lie to the south.

The Ordnance Survey, the United Kingdom&#x27;s mapping agency, bases all elevations including mapped contour lines and spot heights on the mean sea level at Newlyn (&quot;see Ordnance Datum&quot;). The mean sea level data was calculated from hourly readings of the sea level between 1 May 1915 and 30 April 1921.

==Economy==



Newlyn&#x27;s economy is largely dependent on its harbour and the associated fishing industry; Newlyn Harbour is the largest fishing port in England. The port was a major catcher of pilchard until the 1960s. Today, a few vessels have resumed pilchard fishing and use a modern version of the ring net. The largest vessels are beam trawlers owned by W Stevenson and Sons Ltd, one of Cornwall&#x27;s largest fish producers; most of the other vessels are owned by their skippers. The company based in the Old Pilchard Works today are major supplies of Cornish sardines and mixed-species fish. The fishing industry is hard work and markets are seasonably variable; Lamorna Ash experienced it for herself.

==Sport==
Newlyn RFC was formed in 1894 (or 1895) by the curate of St Peter&#x27;s Church, the Rev Fred Peel Yates. The club amalgamated with Penzance RFC in 1944 to form Penzance and Newlyn RFC (The Pirates), currently known as the Cornish Pirates.
Newlyn Non-Athletico FC was formed in 1990 by a group of friends playing on Sunday mornings. They initially played in the West Penwith League, before joining the Mining League in 2002 and the Trelawny League in 2011. The club is nicknamed &#x27;The Crab Army&#x27; due to Newlyn&#x27;s fishing links, as well as the red crab featured on the club crest. The club plays its home games at Penzance Leisure Centre. The ground is affectionately known as &#x27;The Santa Clara Stadium&#x27;, or &#x27;The Aquarium&#x27;.

===Cornish wrestling===
Cornish wrestling tournaments, for prizes, have been held in Newlyn for centuries. Amongst other place, tournaments were held at 
Trewarveneth Farm.

==Food and music festival==
Newlyn is home to the Newlyn fish festival which hosts live music, cooking demonstrations, and various marquees selling local produce.

==Notable landmarks==
The UK National Tidal and Sea Level Facility (NTSLF) maintains a tidal observatory at Newlyn, and the UK Fundamental Benchmark is maintained there.

Newlyn was made famous in the 1880s and 1890s for its Newlyn School artists&#x27; colony, including the painters Thomas Cooper Gotch, Albert Chevallier Tayler and Henry Scott Tuke. The current largest collection of work by the Newlyn School is held by Penlee House Gallery and Museum in nearby Penzance. A collection of Newlyn Copper, produced from circa 1890–1920, is on view at Penlee House. Newlyn is the home of Newlyn Art Gallery which houses a collection of modern art.

<text>Perranporth () is a seaside resort town on the north coast of Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is 2.1 miles east of the St Agnes Heritage Coastline, and around 7 miles south-west of Newquay. Perranporth and its long beach face the Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of 3,066, and is the largest settlement in the civil parish of Perranzabuloe. It has an electoral ward in its own name whose population was 4,270 in the 2011 census.

The town&#x27;s modern name comes from &quot;Porth Peran&quot;, the Cornish for The Cove of Saint Piran who is the patron saint of Cornwall. He founded the St Piran&#x27;s Oratory on Penhale Sands, near Perranporth, in the 7th century. The Oratory was buried under sand dunes for many centuries, being unearthed in the 19th century (reference required).

==History==
John Woodward (1688-1728) recorded that iron ore was mined from a large vein on the beach. In the 1860s ore was moved up the cliff by a &#x27;puffer&#x27; engine. It was then transported from Gravel Hill Mine, at the north end of Perran Beach, to a quay on the Gannel.

The ship &quot;Voorspoed&quot; ran ashore in a northerly gale in Perran Bay on 7 March 1901 whilst travelling from Cardiff to Bahia. The wreck was one of the last to be looted.

From 1903 Perranporth was served by a railway line. Built as the Truro and Newquay Railway, the line ran from Chacewater to Newquay and the principal intermediate stop was Perranporth station. Perranporth also had a second station, known as Perranporth Beach Halt. The line closed in the 1960&#x27;s

Perranporth Airfield, built during World War II as an RAF fighter station, is now a civil airfield. It is located at Cligga Head, on the plateau above the cliffs.

==Geography==
Perranporth is centred on a main street, St Piran&#x27;s Road, part of the B3285 Newquay to St Agnes road. The town centre has various shops, cafés and pubs. The long-distance South West Coast Path runs past the town. There is a long-distance coach service provided by National Express (service 316) which runs between London and Perranporth.

Perranporth is a popular family holiday destination. A wide sandy beach, Perran Beach, extends northeast of the town for about approximately to Ligger Point. The beach faces west onto Perran Bay and the Atlantic Ocean and is a popular surfing location. There are lifeguard beach patrols from May to September and the beach is generally safe for bathing, although there are dangerous rip currents around Chapel Rock at s. Perran Sands is a sprawling holiday camp and caravan site to the north of the town centre.

At the south end of the beach are cliffs with natural arches, natural stacks and tin-mining adits. There is a youth hostel above the cliffs at Droskyn Point. Nearby is the 19th-century Droskyn Castle, formerly a hotel and now divided into apartments.

===Protected areas===
Perran beach is backed by extensive sand dunes which reach nearly a mile inland. Known as Penhale Sands, the dunes are used for orienteering competitions, and there is an 18-hole links golf course.

The far northern end of the beach is used as a naturist beach, although the Ministry of Defense discouraged naturism in the sand dunes that bordered their property.

The dunes are also a valuable resource for wildlife, with many rare plants and insects including Cornwall&#x27;s largest colony of the silver-studded blue, a Red Data Book species.

Southwest of Perranporth, the coast becomes more rocky, with cliffs rising to about 300 feet (90 metres) at Cligga Head. These cliffs form the Cligga Head SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest), noted for its geological and biological characteristics.

==Annual events==

*The &quot;Perranporth Shout&quot; Sea-song and Shanty Festival is held over the third weekend in April, with performers from as far away as Scotland and Norway. It has expanded over the last nine years to be a three-day, five venue occasion. In 2016 the name was changed to &#x27;The Loudest Shout&#x27;, in recognition of the new event on the Friday night when up to 60 singers take part in a mass singing session.
*Perranporth used to host an inter-Celtic festival each October, Lowender Peran, drawing people in from Cornwall and the other five Celtic nations. The festival moved to nearby Newquay when the hotel that hosted it closed in 2015.
*Perranporth SLSC holds an Extreme Surf Triathlon every September that involves a swim in Perranporth Sea, followed by a cycle on the hills around Perranporth, then finished with a &#x27;painful&#x27; run around the dunes and cliffs including Flat Rocks.
* Perranporth&#x27;s Annual &quot;Tunes in the Dunes&quot; music festival features artists such as Tom Walker, Craig David and Fatboy Slim. The festival is held on the sand dunes of Perranporth.

==Places of worship, associations and clubs==
The parish church, which is in the Anglo-Catholic tradition of the Church of England, is in Perranzabuloe. An Anglican chapel of ease in Perranporth dedicated to St Michael opened in 1872 and seats 100 people.

The town also has its own Roman Catholic church, dedicated to Christ the King, on Wheal Leisure Road, which is part of the Diocese of Plymouth. Dom Charles Norris completed stained glass windows for the church of Christ the King.

==Sport==
Surfing is popular in Perranporth with its long sands and beach break. The beach is a destination for kite surfing enthusiasts. There is a golf club, Perranporth Golf Club, just north of the town, while the football team Perranporth A.F.C. play in Division One West of the South West Peninsula League. There is a rugby club, &quot;The Brewers&quot;, and a tennis club.

===Cornish wrestling===
Perranporth has held Cornish wrestling tournaments, for prizes in venues for included the field next to the Perranporth Tennis Club.

==Notable people==
These include:
* Motor engineer and designer Donald Healey, who opened the first garage/petrol station in the town in 1919; a nearby cider farm run by a grandson of his has a detailed graphic display about his life.
* Author Winston Graham, who lived in Perranporth for many years and whose &quot;Poldark&quot; novels are based on the area.

<doc id="410814" wikidata="Q355147" url="?curid=410814" title="Kiyohiko Azuma">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist. From 1999 to 2002, he authored the &quot;yonkoma&quot; comedy manga series &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;, which was later adapted as an anime series by J.C.Staff. In 2003, he began &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot;, a slice-of-life manga series about the adventures of a five-year-old girl; it is serialized in the monthly magazine &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot;.

Both the manga and anime of &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; have been praised for their humor driven by eccentric characters, with Azuma acclaimed as a &quot;master of the four-panel form&quot; for both his art style and comic timing. &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; has received widespread acclaim from critics and audiences due to Azuma&#x27;s artistic talent, writing, and the creation and development of the titular character, with the manga earning multiple awards and nominations.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Azuma entered the Department of Visual Information Design in the Faculty of Art and Design at Kobe Design University. About a year after entering the university, he began doujin activities in a private magazine called &quot;A-Zone,&quot; drawing fan-made parody manga of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and other characters. Upon graduating from college, he received a Bachelor of Arts (Art and Engineering) degree. In 1998, Azuma published a one-shot manga and two webcomics called &quot;Try! Try! Try!&quot;, in which Yotsuba Koiwai, her adoptive father Yousuke Koiwai, Ena, Fūka, and Asagi first appear. 

=== &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; (1999-2002) ===
Azuma became famous for &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;, which was serialized from February 1999 to May 2002 in the monthly magazine &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; by MediaWorks; three additional chapters were published in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Shōnen Sunday&quot; in May 2009 to celebrate the manga&#x27;s tenth anniversary. The manga was first released in English by ADV Manga, and later re-issued by Yen Press.. The series title has no particular significance to the story. &quot;Azumanga&quot; is a portmanteau of the author&#x27;s name &quot;Azuma&quot; and &quot;manga&quot;, while &quot;Daioh&quot; comes from the magazine in which it was originally published, &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot;. In the anime, &quot;daioh&quot; is mentioned during the next episode previews, used in context with the meaning &quot;great king&quot;. &quot;Azumanga&quot; is also used as a general term for Azuma&#x27;s other comics and illustrations. Two previous collections of Azuma&#x27;s works, including official tie-in comics of Pioneer animations, were published as &quot;Azumanga&quot; and &quot;Azumanga 2&quot; in 1998 and 2001, respectively. &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; was later republished in a reduced-size edition called &quot;Azumanga Recycle&quot;. 

&quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; chronicles the everyday life in an unnamed Japanese high school of six girls: child prodigy Chiyo Mihama and her struggle to fit in with girls five years older; reserved Sakaki and her obsession with cute animals while certain ones seem to hate her; spacey Ayumu &quot;Osaka&quot; Kasuga with a skewed perspective on the world; Koyomi &quot;Yomi&quot; Mizuhara&#x27;s aggravation at an annoying best friend; Tomo Takino, whose energy is rivaled only by her lack of sense; sporty Kagura and her one-sided athletics rivalry with Sakaki. 

Secondary characters include homeroom teacher Yukari Tanizaki, her friend, physical education teacher Minamo &quot;Nyamo&quot; Kurosawa, and the creepy classical literature teacher Kimura. The story covers three years of tests, talking between classes, culture festivals, and athletic events at school, as well as time spent traveling to and from school, studying at Chiyo&#x27;s house, and vacations at Chiyo&#x27;s summer beach home and the fictional theme park Magical Land, concluding with the graduation of the main cast. It is generally realistic in tone, marked by occasional bursts of surrealism and absurdity, such as Osaka imagining Chiyo&#x27;s ponytails being &quot;unscrewed&quot; from her head and an episode featuring the characters&#x27; New Year&#x27;s dreams.

An anime television adaptation titled &quot;Azumanga Daioh: The Animation&quot; was produced by J.C.Staff and aired in Japan between April and September 2002, consisting of 130 four-minute segments compiled into 26 episodes. The compiled episodes were released on DVD and Universal Media Discs (UMDs) by Starchild Records, and an English-language version was produced by ADV Films. Before the series, a theatrical short and an original net animation were also produced. Several soundtrack albums were released, as well as three video games.

Both the manga and anime have been praised for their humor driven by eccentric characters, with Azuma acclaimed as a &quot;master of the four-panel form&quot; for both his art style and comic timing. However, he felt that he did not want to “limit himself to a niche topic” and decided to choose a topic in which he had little experience, and began serializing &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; in 2003.

=== &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; (2003-present) ===
&quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; is published by ASCII Media Works in the monthly &quot;shōnen&quot; &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; since the March 2003 issue, with serialization on-going. Chapters have been collected in sixteen &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. Each chapter of &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; takes place on a specific, nearly sequential day of a common year starting on Wednesday. The year was initially believed to be 2003, coinciding with the date of the manga&#x27;s serialization, but Azuma has stated that the manga always takes place in the present day. This allows the appearance of products created after 2003, such as the Nintendo DS Mr. Ayase plays in chapter forty-two. &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; is centered on Yotsuba Koiwai, a five-year-old girl who is energetic, cheerful, curious, odd, and quirky—so much so that even her own father calls her unusual. She is also initially ignorant about many things that a child her age would be expected to know—among them doorbells, escalators, air conditioners, and even playground swings. This is the premise of humorous stories whereby which she learns about—and frequently misunderstands—everyday things.

At the start of the series, Yotsuba and her adoptive father, Yousuke Koiwai, relocate to a new city with the help of Koiwai&#x27;s best friend, an impressively tall man named Takashi Takeda, known as Jumbo. Yotsuba makes a strong impression on the three daughters of the neighboring Ayase family, Asagi, Fuuka, and Ena, after Ena meets Yotsuba trying to find out how a swing works. Most of her daily activities and misadventures often originate from interactions with these characters and more, such as Asagi&#x27;s friend Torako, known as Tiger (from Yotsuba, the kanji for &quot;Tora&quot; is the same kanji in &quot;tiger&quot;). The series has no consistent plot continuity—the focus of the stories is Yotsuba&#x27;s daily voyage of discovery. Many chapters take place on successive days, so that the series follows, almost literally, the characters&#x27; daily lives. The tone can be summarized by the motto, used on chapter title pages and advertising: , or in the original translation, &quot;Enjoy Everything&quot;.

&quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; is drawn not in the vertical four-panel strips of Azuma&#x27;s earlier series, &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;, but in a full-page format, giving him more artistic scope. Azuma&#x27;s work on &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; has been noted for its clean art, and expressive faces. Azuma is also praised for his joyous tone, slice-of-life storytelling, comedic writing, and eccentric yet realistic characters, especially Yotsuba herself. The manga has received widespread acclaim from critics and audiences due to Azuma&#x27;s artistic talent, writing, and the creation and development of the titular character, with the manga earning multiple awards and nominations. Despite its popularity and the success of &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;, no plans have been announced for an anime adaptation of &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot;. In an entry posted on his website on 15 May 2005, Azuma said there were no plans for it to be animated; he reiterated this on 5 December 2008, claiming that the stories and style of &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; are not well-suited for animation. In 2006, &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; and &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; were both selected as one of Japan&#x27;s Top 100 Media Arts in the manga category. No crossovers between the two works occured until sixteenth volume of &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; in 2025, which features a cameo appearance from Osaka.

== Personal life ==
In May 2000, he established Yotsuba Studio in Nerima-ku, Tokyo, with Hideki Satomi. Although he does not disclose much about his private life, in a blog post written in 2011, he has stated that he feels hesitant when buying children’s furniture to use as reference for his manga because he has no children.

<text>Sennen (&quot;Cornish: Sen Senan&quot; or &quot;Sen Senana&quot;) is a coastal civil parish and a village in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. Sennen village is situated approximately eight miles (13 km) west-southwest of Penzance.

Sennen parish is bounded by the sea to the west and bordered by the parishes of St Just to the north, St Buryan to the east, St Levan to the south. The Longships, a group of rocky islets situated off Lands End, are also within the parish. The main settlements are Churchtown, Trevescan, Carn Towan, Sennen Cove and Land&#x27;s End.

For the purposes of local government Sennen elects a parish council every four years. The main local authority is Cornwall Council.

==Geography==
Sennen parish is situated at the western tip of the Penwith peninsula and is exposed to prevailing westerly winds from the Atlantic. Geologically, it is located on the Land&#x27;s End Granite, one of the five major granite batholiths that make up the spine of Cornwall (&quot;see Geology of Cornwall&quot;). Consequently, the parish has a bare moorland-like character with very few trees and no woodland.

The parish consists of of land, of water and of foreshore. The population was 829 at the 2001 census.

The church town, Sennen, is the most westerly village in mainland England and is west-southwest of London. Below the village is the harbour settlement of Sennen Cove.

==Church==
Sennen parish church is dedicated to St Sinninus but has also been dedicated to St John the Baptist. There has been a church here since at least the 15th century. A visit by members of the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society on their annual excursion in August 1893 translated a Latin inscription on a stone at the base of the font as ″&quot;In the year of the Lord 1441 [2, 3, or 4], this Church was dedicated on [the festival of] the beheading of St John the Baptist&quot;″. The present church has a chancel and nave, a south aisle and a north transept. A wall-painting depicting two round embattled towers was uncovered during restoration in 1867. There is also a headless alabaster figure representing the Virgin Mary in the transept. The church has a three-stage battlemented tower housing a ring of three bells.

There are five Cornish crosses in the parish. One is at Escalls and another at Sennen Green. Trevilley cross is one of only two crosses with a crucifixus figure on a cross carved onto the stone (there is a cross on the other side of the head). A cross on the churchyard wall came from a site near the Giant&#x27;s Stone. A fine cross in the cemetery adjoining the churchyard was found in use as a footbridge near Trevear and moved to the churchyard in 1878. About 1890 it was moved to its present position.

==Old customs==
On the old Christmas Day in the 1830s (and before) the farmers of St Sennen assembled for the festivities. One of the dishes was a pie made from 24 blackbirds. At midnight the young men went out to see the ‘cattle kneel’ and on their return they threw rushes onto the fire. The number of crackles, or the particular form assumed, told the fortunes of those who threw them into the fire.

<doc id="410821" wikidata="Q224090" url="?curid=410821" title="Quicksand">
<text>Quicksand (also known as sinking sand) is a colloid consisting of fine granular material (such as sand, silt or clay) and water. It forms in saturated loose sand when the sand is suddenly agitated. When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upward flowing water (as from an artesian spring). In the case of upward-flowing water, forces oppose the force of gravity and suspend the soil particle.

The cushioning of water gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluid-like texture. In accordance with Archimedes&#x27; principle, objects in liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced soil/water mix and the submerged object floats due to its buoyancy.

Soil liquefaction may occur in partially saturated soil when it is shaken by an earthquake or similar forces. The movement combined with an increase in pore pressure (of groundwater) leads to the loss of particle cohesion, causing buildings or other objects on that surface to sink.

== Properties ==
Quicksand is a shear thinning non-Newtonian fluid: when undisturbed, it often appears to be solid (&quot;gel&quot; form), but a less than 1% change in the stress on the quicksand will cause a sudden decrease in its viscosity (&quot;sol&quot; form). After an initial disturbance—such as a person attempting to walk on it—the water and sand in the quicksand separate and dense regions of sand sediment form; it is because of the formation of these high volume fraction regions that the viscosity of the quicksand seems to decrease suddenly. Someone stepping on it will start to sink. To move within the quicksand, a person or object must apply sufficient pressure on the compacted sand to re-introduce enough water to liquefy it. The forces required to do this are quite large: to remove a foot from quicksand at a speed of 1 cm/s would require the same amount of force as that needed to lift a car.

It is impossible for a human to sink entirely into quicksand, due to the higher density of the fluid. Quicksand has a density of about 2 grams per cubic centimeter, whereas the density of the human body is only about 1 gram per cubic centimeter. At that level of density, sinking beyond about waist height in quicksand is impossible. Even objects with a higher density than quicksand will float on it if stationary. Aluminium, for example, has a density of about 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter, but a piece of aluminium will float on top of quicksand until motion causes the sand to liquefy.

Continued or panicked movement, however, may cause a person to sink further in the quicksand. Since this increasingly impairs movement, it can lead to a situation where other factors such as exposure (i.e., sun stroke, dehydration and hypothermia), drowning in a rising tide or attacks by predatory or otherwise aggressive animals may harm a trapped person.

Quicksand may be escaped by slow movement of the legs in order to increase viscosity of the fluid, and rotation of the body so as to float in the supine position (lying horizontally with the face and torso facing up).

==In popular culture==
Quicksand is a trope of adventure fiction, particularly in film, where it is typically and unrealistically depicted with a suction effect that causes anyone or anything that walks into it to sink until fully submerged and risk drowning. This has led to the common misconception that humans can be completely immersed and drown in quicksand, which is impossible. According to a 2010 article by &quot;Slate&quot;, this gimmick had its heyday in the 1960s, when almost 3% of all films showed characters sinking in clay, mud, or sand.

<doc id="410822" wikidata="Q5037874" url="?curid=410822" title="Carbis Bay">
<text>Carbis Bay (Cornish: &quot;Karrbons&quot;, meaning &quot;causeway&quot;) is a seaside resort and village in Cornwall, England. It lies southeast of St Ives, on the western coast of St Ives Bay, on the Atlantic coast. The South West Coast Path passes above the beach.

==History==
Carbis Bay is perhaps best known as the location of the 47th G7 summit in 2011.

==Geography==
Carbis Bay is almost contiguous with the town of St Ives and is in St Ives civil parish (part of the area served by St Ives Town Council), which encompasses St Ives, Carbis Bay, Lelant and Halsetown. The 2001 census gave the combined population of Carbis Bay and Lelant as 3,482. Lelant, an older settlement which is one mile to the south-east, Carbis Bay and St Ives are linked by the A3074 road which joins the A30 at Rose-an-Grouse. Carbis Bay railway station, above the beach, is one of five railway stations on the St Ives Bay Line which joins the mainline at St Erth railway station, which is also at Rose-an-Grouse. St Erth station is the junction for the main line to London Paddington.

Carbis Bay overlooks the small bay of the same name (Cornish: &quot;Porth reb Tor&quot;, meaning &quot;cove beside the eminence&quot;, part of St Ives Bay) which is bounded to the north by Porthminster Point and to the east by Hawk&#x27;s Point and contains a popular family beach. Hawk&#x27;s Point is within the Hayle Estuary and Carrack Gladden Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and in the Victorian era was known locally for its pleasure grounds. The garden had a tea house and grotto; it was a venue for Sunday School outings and Band of Hope galas. By 1880, the proprietor William Payne claimed in an advertisement that it was &quot;the largest establishment of the kind in the West ...&quot;.

==Mining==
Wheal Providence mine in Carbis Bay is the type locality of the rare mineral Connellite.

== Local facilities ==

===Notable structures===

The parish church, which is dedicated to St Anta and All Saints, contains a ring of ten bells. This was the largest peal in a Cornish parish church until St Keverne&#x27;s bells were increased to ten in 2001. The Carbis Bay Hotel, on the seafront, was built in 1894 by Silvanus Trevail. Behind the village stands the Knill Monument, known locally as &quot;The Steeple&quot;, a high monument to John Knill, a mayor of nearby St Ives during the 18th century.

===Transport===
Carbis Bay is connected to the national railway network by the St Erth to St Ives branch line. St Erth is on the Cornish main line linking London Paddington to Penzance. Road coaches also operate to and from London and St Erth on the National Express (London–Penzance) service. There are local buses to and from St Ives / St Erth / Hayle / Penzance / Helston and other areas. Overnight travel services include the &quot;Night Riviera&quot; sleeper train between Paddington and Penzance via St Erth. A night coach via London Heathrow (arriving 05.30am) and London Victoria (arriving 06.30am), calls at Carbis Bay and West Cornwall.

===Schools===
St Uny Primary School, a Church of England School voluntarily controlled by the Diocese of Truro, is situated in Carbis Bay.

==G7 Summit==
In June 2021, Carbis Bay hosted the 47th G7 summit.

==Cornish wrestling==
Cornish wrestling tournaments were held on Longstone Down, Longstone, which is now part of Carbis Bay.

<doc id="410823" wikidata="Q7866417" url="?curid=410823" title="USGS DEM">
<text>The USGS DEM standard is a geospatial file format developed by the United States Geological Survey for storing a raster-based digital elevation model. It is an open standard, and is used throughout the world. It has been superseded by the USGS&#x27;s own SDTS format but the format remains popular due to large numbers of legacy files, self-containment, relatively simple field structure and broad, mature software support.

==DEM Level==
A USGS DEM can be classified into one of four levels of quality. This is due to the multiple methods of data collection, and certainty in the data.
==Format Structure==
The USGS DEM format is a self-contained (single file) set of ASCII-encoded (text) 1024-byte (1024 ASCII chars) blocks that fall into three record categories called A, B, and C. There is no cross-platform ambiguity since line ending control codes are not used, and all data including numbers is represented in readable text form. There is no known binary analogue of the format, although it is common practice to compress the files with gzip.

Floating-point numbers are encoded using Fortran scientific notation, so C/C++ programs need to swap the &quot;D&quot; exponent-indicating character with &quot;E&quot; when parsing (and vice versa when writing).

A record fields hold the origin, type, summary statistics and the measurement systems used by the profiles. The A record appears once as the file&#x27;s header, the C record also appears once as the trailer, and multiple B records (called profiles) comprise the elevation data. A and C records each fit within one block, but a single B record typically requires multiple blocks. When such block-spanning occurs, data are shifted to start cleanly on each block boundary. A records also come in &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; flavors, because the USGS added several fields to the A record. One of the key items is the quadrangle, which is a set of four terrestrial coordinates describing the four-sided polygon enclosing the area of interest.

B records (profiles) are a variable-length longitudinal column of raster elevations that start at a specified location. They are some multiple of 1024 bytes long and contain a small header summarizing the profile. The elevations are contiguous; breaks or other discontinuities are expressed using &quot;void&quot; elevations of value -32767. Each elevation is described as a six-character readable integer occupying a fixed location in a block. The profile header only appears in the first block, so subsequent blocks hold more elevation values. When reading the DEM file from first byte to last, one reads the profiles as columns from west to east. The elevations within a profile run from south to north. The variable-location and variable-length nature of profiles stems mainly from the use of the UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) ground reference system. Since measurements within UTM employ fixed distances (e.g., 30 meters between elevation samples), the quadrangle must slightly distort to map such locations onto the spherical Earth. This distortion usually manifests as a rotated square, hence the elevation columns near the east and west edges start more northward and contain fewer samples.

C records contain root-mean squared error (RMSE) quality control data, using ten six-character integer fields.

<doc id="410828" wikidata="Q3291384" url="?curid=410828" title="Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo">
<text>Don Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo (July 4, 1807 – January 18, 1890) was a Californio general, statesman, and public figure. He was born a subject of Spain, performed his military duties as an officer of the Republic of Mexico, and shaped the transition of Alta California from a territory of Mexico to the U.S. state of California. He served in the first session of the California State Senate. The city of Vallejo, California, is named after him, and the nearby city of Benicia is named after his wife (née Francisca Benicia Carrillo).

==Early career==

Mariano Vallejo was born in Monterey, California, the eighth of thirteen children and third son of Ignacio Vicente Ferrer Vallejo (1748–1832) and María Antonia Lugo (1776–1855).

There is controversy over Vallejo&#x27;s exact date of birth. According to Vallejo, and his family bible, he was born on 7 July 1807. His baptismal certificate, however, signed by Fr. Baltasar Carnicer states that he was baptized on 5 July 1807, and born the previous night (4 July 1807). Other sources state a birthdate of 7 July 1808.

Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo&#x27;s parents were at Santa Barbara Mission February 18, 1791. His paternal grandparents were Gerónimo Vallejo and Antonia Gómez, and his maternal grandparents were Francisco Lugo and Juana María Rita Martínez. His father&#x27;s great grandfather, Pedro Vallejo, was said to have served as viceroy of New Spain, although his name does not appear on the list of viceroys. Other documents show his paternal great grandfather to be Jose Inocencio Vallejo y Olvera Gordivar instead. Born 1656 in Tapatitlan de Morelos and died in 1770, father of Juan Lucas Vallejo de Cornejo y Ramirez (1688-1713), father of Geronimo Vallejo. Earlier Vallejo ancestors were said to include a captain who served under Hernan Cortés and an admiral, Alonso Vallejo, said to be the commander of the ship which brought Columbus back to Spain as a prisoner in 1500. However, these ancestors were probably only a family mythology. Ignacio himself had been a well considered sergeant (&quot;sargento distinguido&quot;) at the Presidio of Monterey, who eventually served as &quot;Alcalde&quot; of San José.

As a teenager, Mariano, his nephew Juan Bautista Alvarado (1809–1882), and José Castro (1808–1860) received special instruction from Governor Pablo Vicente de Solá. The boys received government documents and newspapers from Mexico City, as well as access to the governor&#x27;s personal library. Vallejo then worked as a clerk for English merchant William Hartnell, who taught Vallejo English, French, and Latin.

Vallejo was serving as the personal secretary to the new Governor of California, Luis Argüello, when news of Mexico&#x27;s independence reached Monterey. Argüello enrolled Vallejo as a cadet in the Presidio company in 1824. After being promoted to corporal, Argüello appointed Vallejo to the &quot;diputación&quot;, the territorial legislature. He was promoted to &quot;alférez&quot; (equal to a modern army second lieutenant), and in 1829, Vallejo led a group of soldiers against the Miwoks, under chief Estanislao. After a three-day battle, Vallejo&#x27;s troops forced the Miwok to flee to Mission San José, seeking refuge with the padres.

==Rise to power==

In 1831 Vallejo participated in the &quot;emergency installation&quot; of Pío Pico as acting Governor. Vallejo became the Commander of the Presidio of San Francisco in 1833, oversaw the secularization of Mission San Francisco Solano. Mission San Francisco Solano was taken over by General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo. At first he gave some of the land to the native mission workers as ordered. But later he transferred all the land and building to own Rancho Petaluma Adobe of 44,000 acres in the Petaluma Valley. Vallejo laid out the town of Sonoma in 1835. He had a large plaza made in front of the old mission chapel. But then he took tiles from the church roof and put them on his own house. In poor shape the mission church later was torn down. In need of a church for the town he made, in 1840 Vallejo had a small chapel built where the original parish church was.

He founded the town of Sonoma, and was granted Rancho Petaluma by Governor José Figueroa in 1834. In 1835 he was appointed Comandante of the Fourth Military District and Director of Colonization of the Northern Frontier, the highest military command in Northern California. Vallejo began construction of the Presidio of Sonoma to counter the Russian presence at Fort Ross. Vallejo transferred most of the soldiers from San Francisco to Sonoma, and began construction of his two-story &quot;Casa Grande&quot; adobe on the town plaza. He formed an alliance with Sem-Yeto, also known as Chief Solano of the Suisunes tribe, providing Vallejo with over a thousand Suisunes allies during his conflicts with other tribes.

Governor Figueroa died in September 1835, and was replaced by Nicolás Gutiérrez, who was unpopular with the Californio population, resulting in an uprising headed by Juan Alvarado the next year. Alvarado tried to persuade Vallejo to join the uprising, but he declined to become involved. One hundred-seventy Californios led by José Castro and fifty Americans led by Isaac Graham marched on Monterey. After the rebels fired a single cannon shot into the Presidio, Governor Gutiérrez surrendered on November 5, 1836. On November 7, Alvarado wrote to his uncle Mariano, informing Vallejo he had claimed to be acting under Vallejo&#x27;s orders and asking him to come to Monterey to take part in the government. Vallejo came to Monterey as a hero, and on November 29, the &quot;diputación&quot; promoted Vallejo from &quot;alférez&quot; to colonel and named him Comandante General of the &quot;Free State of Alta California&quot;, while Alvarado was named Governor. The Federal Government in Mexico City would later endorse Vallejo and Alvarado&#x27;s actions and confirm their new positions.

==Troubles==

In 1840, Isaac Graham allegedly began agitating for a Texas-style revolution in California, in March issuing a notice for a planned horse race that was loosely construed into being a plot for revolt. Alvarado notified Vallejo of the situation, and in April the Californian military began arresting American and English immigrants, eventually detaining about 100 in the Presidio of Monterey. At the time, there were fewer than 400 foreigners from all nations in the department. Vallejo returned to Monterey and ordered Castro to take 47 of the prisoners to San Blas by ship, to be deported to their home countries. Under pressure from British and American diplomats, President Anastasio Bustamante released the remaining prisoners and began a court martial against Castro. Also assisting in the release of those caught up in the Graham Affair was American traveler Thomas J. Farnham. In 1841, Graham and 18 of his associates returned to Monterey, with new passports issued by the Mexican Federal Government.

Also in 1841, the Russians at Fort Ross offered to sell the post to Vallejo. After several months of negotiations and delays by the Mexican authorities and Governor Alvarado (who feared his uncle was plotting to overthrow him), John Sutter purchased the fort. This economic and military setback confirmed Vallejo&#x27;s belief that it would be better if California was no longer ruled from Mexico City. Although both France and the United Kingdom expressed interest in acquiring Alta California, Vallejo believed the best hope for economic and cultural development lay with the United States.

In November 1841, Vallejo was meeting with José Castro at Mission San José when he was informed of the arrival in California of an immigrant party led by John Bidwell and John Bartleson. Half of the group was staying with Dr. John Marsh north of Mount Diablo, while the rest had continued on to San José. They were arrested before reaching the pueblo for illegally entering Mexico and brought to Vallejo at the mission. Vallejo&#x27;s orders from Mexico City were clear. Americans entering Mexico without valid passports were to be sent back to the United States. However, after the Graham affair, Vallejo was reluctant to deport another group of Americans, especially those with skills useful for colonizing the northern frontier. These reasons, coupled with his disillusionment with the Mexican government, led Vallejo to grant passports to the immigrants detained in the mission and to give Marsh passports for those camped on his rancho.

In 1842, the Federal Government replaced Vallejo and his nephew Alvarado with Manuel Micheltorena as both civil and military Governor of Alta California. Micheltorena arrived with the &quot;batallón fijo&quot;, a force of 300 pardoned criminals, who out of desperation at not being paid began to loot the population.

==Bear Flag Revolt==

In the early morning of June 14, 1846, Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo was taken prisoner by a ragtag band of Americans, led by William B. Ide, who had decided to emulate the Texans by revolting against California&#x27;s Mexican government. They later made and raised an improvised flag featuring a grizzly bear that some viewers mistook for a pig. Instead of resisting, Vallejo, who favored the American takeover of California, invited the rebels inside his quarters in the &quot;Casa Grande&quot; for a meal and drinks. The Americans proceeded to get drunk while negotiating with Vallejo a letter of capitulation that guaranteed that neither Vallejo nor his family would be taken prisoner, which he unopposedly signed. However, when the agreement was presented to those outside they refused to endorse it. Rather than releasing the Mexican officers under parole they insisted they be held as hostages. Although Vallejo was sympathetic to the advent of American rule, he deemed the perpetrators of the Bear Flag Revolt to be mere lowlife rabble. As he wrote in his five-volume history,

if the men who hoisted the &#x27;Bear Flag&#x27; had raised the flag that Washington sanctified by his abnegation and patriotism, there would have been no war on the Sonoma frontier, for all our minds were prepared to give a brotherly embrace to the sons of the Great Republic, whose enterprising spirit had filled us with admiration. Ill-advisedly, however, as some say, or dominated by a desire to rule without let or hindrance, as others say, they placed themselves under the shelter of a flag that pictured a bear, an animal that we took as the emblem of rapine and force. This mistake was the cause of all the trouble, for when the Californians saw parties of men running over their plains and forests under the &#x27;Bear Flag,&#x27; they thought that they were dealing with robbers and took the steps they thought most effective for the protection of their lives and property.

Vallejo, his French secretary Victor Prudon, his brother Salvador Vallejo, and their brother-in-law Jacob P. Leese were taken as prisoners to John C. Frémont&#x27;s camp in the Central Valley. Vallejo was confident that the insurgents were acting under Fremont&#x27;s orders and had no reason to doubt that as soon as he met Fremont (whom he regarded as his friend), he and his companions would be released, so the prospect of being sent to Sutter&#x27;s Fort did not worry him much. However, Frémont ordered they be kept prisoners in Sutter&#x27;s Fort.

Conditions for the prisoners were good, until Frémont discovered they were well fed and allowed to walk around the fort several times a day. He replaced the jailer, instructing the replacement to treat them &quot;no better than any other prisoner&quot;. Mariano contracted malaria while being held at the fort. After agreeing to remain neutral during the remainder of the war with Mexico, Mariano was released on August 2, 1846, after &quot;John Murphy had arrived at Sutter&#x27;s Fort with Stockton&#x27;s new orders on August 1,&quot; and arrived at &quot;Casa Grande&quot; a day or two later, weighing only 96 pounds. Salvador Vallejo and Jacob P. Leese were released about a week later. By the time of his release, Mariano was still uncertain about his stance in the war. Because of his belief that California would thrive better with the United States, and that at this time, the Americans were in complete control of the northern area of California, he eventually sided with them. At his home, he showed his allegiance by burning his Mexican uniform in a dignified manner.

==State politics==

Once the United States defeated Mexico in the war, Vallejo proved his allegiance to his new country by persuading wealthy Californios to accept American rule. An influential member of the state&#x27;s Constitutional Convention, he was elected as a member of the first session of the State Senate in 1850. In 1843, he had been deeded title to Rancho Suscol. In 1850, he offered to donate of that land to the new state government on which to build a capitol away from its cramped quarters in San Jose and also offered to pay for a considerable amount of the construction. The offer was accepted by the new state legislature and signed into law by Governor John McDougall, convening in Vallejo, as the new city was named, for the first time in 1851. However, construction lagged, and state bureaucrats were confronted with inadequate, leaky buildings and a soggy location. Within three years, the state legislature and newly elected Governor John Bigler had authorized the capital&#x27;s relocation three more times, to Sacramento, Benicia and finally a permanent return to Sacramento.

== Relationship with Native Americans ==
Vallejo, the city that was named after the General, was once home of the Coast Miwok as well as Suisunes and other Patwin Native American tribes. There are three confirmed Native American sites located in the rock outcrops in the hills above Blue Rock Springs Park. The California Archaeological Inventory has indicated that the three Indian sites are located on Sulphur Springs Mountain.

General Vallejo is in the history books as a person who &quot;fought for the rights of the Native Americans&quot;, but also one who would &quot;go out on raids into Indian territory to bring back new workers&quot;.

==Landholdings==

Although the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo formally protected the legal rights of Mexicans now part of the United States, a long legal challenge to Vallejo&#x27;s land title cost him thousands of dollars in legal fees and finally deprived him of almost all his land and farm animals. Most Californios could not afford the legal expenses to claim their lands, which were thus lost to wealthy Americans and the flood of immigrants, beginning with the Gold Rush, which left the Californios outnumbered and unable to protect their political power. At some time prior to 1869, Vallejo gave the Mexican land grant Rancho Suscol to his daughter, Epifania Guadalupe Vallejo, April 3, 1851, as a wedding present, when she married General John B. Frisbie.

==Family life==

Jose Manuel Salvador Vallejo (1813–1876), the General&#x27;s younger brother, received his commission in the Mexican army in 1835, and was appointed Captain of militia at Sonoma in 1836. In 1838 he was grantee of Rancho Napa; in 1839 of Salvador&#x27;s Ranch, and in 1844 he and his brother Antonio Juan Vallejo (1816–1857) were grantees of Rancho Lupyomi. Salvador Vallejo also claimed Rancho Yajome. In 1863 he was commissioned a Major in the Union Army by Governor Stanford. Major Vallejo organized the 1st Battalion of Native Cavalry, California Volunteers, and he served as far east as Arizona, but did not have a battlefield role in the Civil War. He resigned in 1865 after the war and returned to his ranch in Napa.

Encarnacion Vallejo (1809–1902), the General&#x27;s sister, married John B.R. Cooper, who was the grantee of Rancho Nicasio and other properties. María Paula Rosalia Vallejo (1811–1889), the General&#x27;s sister, married Jacob P. Leese grantee of Rancho Huichica and other properties. José de Jesús Vallejo (1798–1882), the General&#x27;s elder brother, was the grantee of Rancho Arroyo de la Alameda. María Isidora Vallejo (1792–1830), the General&#x27;s sister, married Mariano de Jesús Soberanes. Their daughter María Ygnacia Soberanes married Dr. Edward Turner Bale grantee of Rancho Carne Humana.

On March 6, 1832, Mariano Vallejo married Francisca Benicia Carrillo (1815–1891) in the Chapel of the Presidio of San Diego. Francisca, born August 23, 1815, in San Diego, was one of twelve children of Joaquin Carrillo and María Ygnacia López. The Carrillo family of California was one of the leading families in San Diego. When Vallejo settled in Sonoma, his widowed mother-in-law, María Ygnacia López de Carrillo, was granted the nearby Rancho Cabeza de Santa Rosa in what is now Santa Rosa, California, and settled there with her children.

By the time of his death on January 18, 1890, Vallejo led a modest lifestyle on the last vestige of his once vast landholdings at his Lachryma Montis home in Sonoma, California. A few days after the first anniversary of her husband&#x27;s death, Francisca Benicia Carrillo de Vallejo died on January 30, 1891. He is interred at the Mountain Cemetery in Sonoma.

==Legacy==

The city of Vallejo, California, founded by his son-in-law, and the U.S. Navy submarine were named in his honor. Vallejo&#x27;s Rancho Petaluma Adobe is now preserved in the Petaluma Adobe State Historic Park as a National Historic Landmark. His home in Sonoma, California, where he and his wife lived for more than 35 years, now serves as a museum and cultural center as part of the Sonoma State Historic Park.

A &quot;life-size bronze likeness of&quot; General Vallejo &quot;sitting on a bench,&quot; sculpted by Jim Callahan, was unveiled at Sonoma Plaza in June 2017, with a plaque describing in English and Spanish the many roles Vallejo played as a Spanish, Mexican, and American leader.

Actor George J. Lewis was cast as General Vallejo in the 1956 episode &quot;The Bear Flag,&quot; on the syndicated television anthology series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews. The segment focused on the conflict between newly arrived Americans and the old Spanish families of California. Robert Tafur played Don Miguel Ruiz, and Don C. Harvey was cast as Ezekiel &quot;Stuttering Zeke&quot; Merritt, who proceeds with plans for the Bear Flag Revolt.

Vallejo, and the city of Sonoma, are the subjects of the opera &quot;The Dreamers&quot; by David Conte and Philip Littell.

<text>Sniper is a 1993 American action film directed by Luis Llosa. The film stars Tom Berenger and Billy Zane as snipers on an assassination mission in Panama. It is the first installment in the &quot;Sniper&quot; film series, and was followed by ten direct-to-video sequels: &quot;Sniper 2&quot;, &quot;Sniper 3&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Sniper: Rogue Mission&quot;, &quot;Sniper: G.R.I.T. – Global Response &amp; Intelligence Team&quot; and &quot;Sniper: The Last Stand&quot;. It was shot in Queensland, Australia, and debuted at number two in the United States.

== Plot ==
Master Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Beckett, Force Reconnaissance Marine, an experienced sniper, and his spotter, Cpl. Papich, are on a mission to assassinate a Panamanian rebel leader in the jungle. Upon successful completion of their mission, Beckett and Papich covertly withdraw from the area to await extraction. Because they are erroneously extracted in daylight instead of at night, Papich is killed by a sniper.

Later, Beckett is paired with an inexperienced civilian, Richard Miller, to eliminate rebel General Miguel Alvarez funded by a Colombian drug lord, Raoul Ochoa. Miller is an Olympic medalist and SWAT team sharpshooter, but he has no combat experience and no confirmed kills to his name. Miller is also ordered by his superiors to kill Beckett if he threatens to undermine the covert operation. While proceeding to the staging area, Miller&#x27;s UH-1 helicopter is fired upon by a guerrilla. Several of the helicopter&#x27;s crew and passengers are killed. Miller is unable to shoot him; instead, the helicopter&#x27;s fatally-wounded door-gunner makes the kill, but the aircraft&#x27;s surviving aviator believes Miller made the crucial shot, earning Miller a false reputation.

On the mission, Beckett insists on deviating from the plan that Miller was given. Early on, they encounter a group of Indians, who agree to lead them past the rebel guerrillas, in return for a favor: they must agree to eliminate El Cirujano (&quot;The Surgeon&quot;), an ex-CIA agent and expert in torture who has been aiding the rebels. Beckett agrees to do so.

Uncertain of Miller&#x27;s reliability and skeptical about his &quot;kill&quot; while recently aboard the helicopter, he tells Miller to kill El Cirujano in order to prove himself. However, when the time comes, Miller fails again by first firing a &quot;warning shot,&quot; followed by a shot at Cirujano&#x27;s head, which misses. In the ensuing firefight with the alarmed guerrillas, one of the Indians is killed; the rest withdraw further help.

En route to the target, they realize they are being followed by another sniper. They head to a village to contact their informant, a priest, only to find that he has been murdered well before they arrived. Beckett speculates out loud that it is the work of El Cirujano, calling into question Miller&#x27;s credibility. That night, Beckett baits the sniper following them into a trap take him out.

The two men finally reach the General&#x27;s hacienda. While waiting for their targets to emerge, they find Cirujano to be alive after all. Miller isn&#x27;t hidden very well, and is spotted by one of the guards trying to sneak up on him. Beckett kills Miller&#x27;s attacker while Miller takes out the drug lord. Being forced to save Miller&#x27;s life instead of killing the General, Beckett insists on going back to take out the General. Miller&#x27;s refusal to complete the mission leads to an exchange of fire between Beckett and Miller. Miller ceases after running out of ammunition.

As rebels close in on the two, Beckett attempts to provide cover fire for Miller. Seeing himself outnumbered, he surrenders to the rebels and, knowing Miller is watching, drops a bullet on the ground. Miller picks it up after Beckett is taken away.

With nighttime approaching, Miller goes to the extraction site, but instead of boarding the helicopter, he heads to the base camp, where he kills the general with his knife. He finds Beckett being tortured by El Cirujano, who has cut off the trigger finger of Beckett&#x27;s right hand. Beckett spots Miller and uses a ploy to both distract Cirujano and mouth Miller instruction to kill both of them with one shot. Instead, Miller sticks to &quot;one shot, one kill&quot; and shoots Cirujano in the head. The two run to the helicopter for extraction, and Beckett once again saves Miller&#x27;s life. Using his left hand, he uses Cirujano&#x27;s pistol to shoot an ambushing sniper. The final scene shows Beckett and Miller on the way back home aboard the helicopter.

== Production ==
===Casting===
Billy Zane was cast after his starring role in &quot;Dead Calm&quot; raised his profile. Director Luis Llosa, who grew up watching American films, called modern films &quot;cartoonish and antiseptic&quot; in their depiction of violence; he said that he wanted to bring back a sense of impact to killing.

===Filming===
Principle filming begain in August 1991 at locations in Queensland, Australia including Port Douglas, Paronella Park, and Kurunda. Some additional filming was done in Panama.

== Release ==
=== Home media ===
Columbia TriStar Home Video released it on VHS in August 1993, LaserDisc in September 1993, and on DVD in October 1998.

==Reception==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Sniper&quot; was held back from release in 1992. It debuted at number two at the box office on January 29, 1993, in 1551 theaters and went on to gross $18,994,653 in the US.

===Critical response===
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 36% of 14 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 4.7/10. Roger Ebert rated it 3/4 stars and wrote, &quot;&quot;Sniper&quot; expresses a cool competence that is a pleasure to watch. It isn&#x27;t a particularly original film, but what it does, it does well.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;an expertly directed, yet ultimately unsatisfying psychological thriller&quot; that is &quot;undermined by underdeveloped characters and pedestrian dialogue.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;partly a badly choreographed action drama and partly a psychological exploration of Beckett&#x27;s mind, which comes up empty.&quot;

Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it a shallow film that does not explore the themes suggested by the script and instead turns into a bloodless, macho video game. Clifford Terry of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it a formulaic male-bonding drama that features a Hollywood odd-coupling. Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; criticized the lack of character progression and the implausible conclusion.

Stephen Wigler of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; called it a &quot;poorly written, badly directed film&quot; that substitutes violence for sex. Marjorie Baumgarten of the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, &quot;&quot;Sniper&quot; does little that&#x27;s terribly original but that which it does, it does with great competence and grace.&quot;

==Sequels==

&quot;Sniper&quot; spawned ten sequels: &quot;Sniper 2&quot; in 2002, &quot;Sniper 3&quot; in 2004, &quot;&quot; in 2011, &quot;&quot; in 2014, &quot;&quot; in 2016, &quot;&quot; in 2017, &quot;&quot; in 2020, &quot;Sniper: Rogue Mission&quot; in 2022, &quot;Sniper: G.R.I.T. – Global Response &amp; Intelligence Team&quot; in 2023 and &quot;Sniper: The Last Stand&quot; in 2025. &quot;Sniper: Reloaded&quot;, &quot;Sniper: Ghost Shooter&quot; and &quot;Sniper: Ultimate Kill&quot; feature Billy Zane&#x27;s role of Richard Miller from the first &quot;Sniper&quot; film reprised, having himself become a sniper following his tour experience with Thomas Beckett.

<doc id="410835" wikidata="Q3618549" url="?curid=410835" title="Anthony Warlow">
<text>Anthony Warlow (born 18 November 1961) is an Australian musical theatre performer, noted for his character acting and considerable vocal range. He is a classically trained lyric baritone and made his debut with the Australian Opera in 1980.

Warlow has performed on Broadway, the West End, Carnegie Hall and across Australia with all of the symphony orchestras. His studio recordings have spanned three decades and include solo albums, cast recordings and live performances in concert and with Opera Australia.

He has been honoured as an Australian National Treasure and his achievements have been acknowledged with his investiture as a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for his services to the performing arts.

==Performances==
===Musical theatre===
Warlow&#x27;s notable musical theatre roles include lead roles in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (as The Phantom), &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (as Archibald Craven), &quot;Annie&quot; (as Daddy Warbucks), &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (as Sky Masterson), &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (as Henry Higgins), &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot; (original Gothic thriller cast recording and, for the 25th anniversary, as Dr Henry Jekyll / Edward Hyde), &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; (as Don Quixote), &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; (as Frederik Egerman), &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; (as Sweeney Todd), as well as a significant supporting role in &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (as Enjolras). Circa 1988, he was internationally regarded as the best Enjolras and was honoured by being selected for the complete symphonic recording, along with leading &quot;Les Misérables&quot; performers from around the world along with fellow Australian actor Philip Quast as Javert. This was arguably his break-through role, as he was cast as the Phantom as the Australian tour of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; was ending. In 1998, he played Teen Angel in &quot;Grease: The Arena Spectacular&quot;. He performed the role of Doctor Yuri Zhivago in the new musical adaptation of Boris Pasternak&#x27;s novel &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;. In 2012, Warlow reprised his role as Daddy Warbucks in &quot;Annie&quot; at the Lyric Theatre, Star City, for a strictly limited season of 12 weeks. 

Warlow made his long-awaited debut on Broadway, New York, in the James Lapine-directed &quot;Annie&quot; in the role of Daddy Warbucks at the Palace Theatre. From June to September 2015, he played Charles Frohman/Captain Hook in &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; on Broadway. From December 2015 to May 2016, he returned to Australia playing the part of Tevye in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;.

Warlow reprised the title roles in &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot; in October 2019 (His first time playing the roles on stage) in a 25th anniversary concert tour. The production first performed with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra at the Arts Centre Melbourne and then in November in Sydney at the ICC Sydney Theatre with the Sydney International Orchestra.

In 2020, he was set to reprise his role of Archibald Craven in &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; in Australia. However, the production was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Opera===
Warlow&#x27;s opera roles with Opera Australia include major roles in &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (Gabriel Eisenstein), &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (Papageno), &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (Puck) and &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;.

===Gilbert and Sullivan===
Warlow&#x27;s Gilbert and Sullivan roles for Opera Australia include the featured comedic roles of Ko-Ko in &quot;The Mikado&quot; (2004–2009), Archibald Grosvenor in &quot;Patience&quot; (1996), Pirate King in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; (2006–2007–2010) and in the 2005 double-bill of &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; (as the Learned Judge) and &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; (as Captain Corcoran). Apart from &quot;The Mikado&quot;, these Gilbert and Sullivan productions are available on DVD. In 1987, Warlow also performed a one-man show originally written for John Reed, called &quot;A Song to Sing, O&quot;, about George Grossmith, the comedian who originated the principal comic roles for Gilbert and Sullivan from 1877 through the 1880s.

===Other performances===
Warlow performed &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; at the 1993 NSWRL Grand Final on 26 September 1993 and at the 2008 NRL Grand Final on 5 October 2008.

==&quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; tour: 2006–2007==
Between 2 August 2006 and 2 June 2007, Warlow appeared in the Opera Australia production of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; (a popular Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera), in which he played the role of the &quot;Pirate King&quot; – with performances during 2006 in Sydney, New South Wales (at the Sydney Opera House), in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory and in Brisbane, Queensland (at the Lyric Theatre, Queensland Performing Arts Centre), as well as enjoying full houses in Melbourne, Victoria in 2007.

Warlow&#x27;s Pirate King appeared in dress, voice and mannerism very similar to Captain Jack Sparrow from &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;. In a press interview in Brisbane, Warlow said that he had deliberately based his Pirate King on Johnny Depp&#x27;s character from &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; so that people who may not know the opera but are aware of the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; trilogy of movies could enjoy the opera more. This production of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; was shown on television by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on 9 December 2006. A DVD of the production was subsequently released.

==&quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;: 2007–2009==
Warlow first portrayed the Phantom in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; in the original Australian production, circa 1990. It was announced in October 2006 that &quot;Phantom&quot; would re-open in Melbourne the following year and that Warlow had agreed to reprise his role as &quot;The Phantom&quot;.

&quot;Phantom&quot; reopened in Melbourne at the Princess Theatre, its original home, on 19 July 2007. Although he performed for the industry opening night, Warlow was struck down by a bout of influenza that had also claimed many of the other cast and crew, and as a result, he missed the first two and a half weeks of the show&#x27;s Melbourne season. Understudy Simon Pryce performed in his place until he made his return on 9 August 2007.

Unlike the original Australian &quot;Phantom&quot;, Warlow played the Phantom for the two-year tour of Australia and New Zealand. &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; opened at Melbourne&#x27;s Princess Theatre on 28 July 2007, then at Brisbane&#x27;s Lyric Theatre in February 2008 followed by Sydney&#x27;s Lyric Theatre in May 2008. After closing in Sydney on 14 September, the production moved to Auckland, New Zealand and following a holiday break, subsequently opened in Perth in February 2009. The last stop on the tour was Adelaide where Warlow donned the mask for the final time on 23 May 2009. Warlow appeared as a guest at the 25th anniversary production of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall&quot; in London.

==Personal life==

Warlow was found to be suffering from Non-Hodgkin&#x27;s Lymphoma in 1992, during the early publicity for the arena production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; where he was to appear as Pontius Pilate. He had to put his career on hold for about a year while he dealt with the disease. He returned to the performance circuit in the second half of 1993 with a national concert tour for the launch of his &quot;Back in the Swing&quot; album. He has since done promotional work for the Leukaemia Foundation of Australia.

His fourth solo album, &quot;Midnight Dreaming&quot;, reached the top ten of the Australian Aria Charts. Warlow also briefly appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart in 1998 with the double A-side single &quot;Beauty School Dropout/My Prayer&quot;. Warlow was back on television, in a concert performance, on the night of 24 December 2006 (the concert was shown by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation).

<text>The Catholic Church in Canada is part of the worldwide Catholic Church and has a decentralised structure, meaning each diocesan bishop is autonomous but under the spiritual leadership of the Pope and the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops. As of 2021, it has the largest number of adherents to a Christian denomination and a religion in Canada, with 29.4% of Canadians (10.8 million) being adherents according to the census in 2021. There are 73 dioceses and about 7,000 priests in Canada. On a normal Sunday, between 15 and 25 percent of Canada&#x27;s Catholics attend Mass (15 per cent weekly attenders and another nine per cent monthly).

== History ==
===First Catholics in Canada===
In 1497, when John Cabot landed on the island of Newfoundland on the Avalon Peninsula, he raised the Venetian and Papal banners and claimed the land for his sponsor King Henry VII of England, while recognizing the religious authority of the Catholic Church. A letter of John Day states that Cabot landed on 24 June 1497 and &quot;he landed at only one spot of the mainland, near the place where land was first sighted, and they disembarked there with a crucifix and raised banners with the arms of the Holy Father and those of the King of England&quot;. On his third voyage in 1498, he may have been accompanied by Father Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis, who may have established a missionary church at Carbonear on the Avalon Peninsula.

Missionary work among Indigenous peoples began in the early 1610s as a stipulated condition to the colonization projects of the King of France. Historian Robert Choquette credits secular priest Jessé Fleché as the first to perform dozens of baptisms on Indigenous peoples, which impacted the religious landscape of Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki. Jessé Fleché&#x27;s ministry was criticized by Jesuits who believed Fleché erred in baptizing neophytes without teaching them the Catholic faith beforehand. In 1611, the Society of Jesus started its missionary work in Acadia. Unlike their predecessor, the Jesuits began their work on Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki by learning the local language and living alongside the Mi&#x27;kmaq in order to instruct and convert them to Catholicism.

In 1620, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore purchased a tract of land in Newfoundland from Sir William Vaughan and established a colony, calling it Avalon, after the legendary spot where Christianity was introduced to Britain. In 1627 Calvert brought two Catholic priests to Avalon. This was the first continuous Catholic ministry in British North America. Despite the severe religious conflicts of the period, Calvert secured the right of Catholics to practice their religion unimpeded in Newfoundland, and embraced the novel principle of religious tolerance, which he wrote into the Charter of Avalon and the later Charter of Maryland. The Colony of Avalon was thus the first North American jurisdiction to practice religious tolerance.

===British Rule in Canada===
In the wake of the Canada Conquest in 1759, New France became a British colony. Nevertheless, the Catholic Church continued to grow in Canada due to the flexibility imposed on the British regime in Canada by the Treaty of Paris (1763) on sovereigns of the United Kingdom who allowed the favour of the protection of Catholicism and French-speaking people in Canada. This historical perspective still influences Canadian society today.

=== Anti-Catholicism ===

Fears of the Catholic Church were quite strong in the 19th century, especially among Presbyterian and other Protestant Irish immigrants across Canada. In 1853, the Gavazzi Riots left 10 dead in Quebec in the wake of Catholic Irish protest against anti-Catholic speeches by ex-monk Alessandro Gavazzi.

The major flashpoint was public support for Catholic French language schools. Although the Confederation Agreement of 1867 guaranteed the status of Catholic schools where they had been legalized, disputes erupted in numerous provinces, especially in the Manitoba Schools Question in the 1890s and Ontario in the 1910s. In Ontario, Regulation 17 was a regulation by the Ontario Ministry of Education, that restricted the use of French as a language of instruction to the first two years of schooling. French Canada reacted vehemently and resisted the implementation of the Regulation. This conflict, which was first rooted in linguistic and cultural questions, transformed into a religious divide. In 1915, Ontario clergy was divided between French Canadian and Irish allegiances, with the Irish supporting the position of the provincial government. Pope Benedict XV asked his Canadian representative to study the divide in order to reestablish unity among the Catholic church in the province of Ontario. Regulation 17 is among the reasons why French Canada distanced itself from the war effort, as its young men refused to enlist.

Protestant elements succeeded in blocking the growth of French-language Catholic public schools. The Irish Catholics generally supported the English language position advocated by the Protestants. Despite this, French language education in Ontario continues today in Catholic and public schools.

=== French versus Irish ===
The central theme of Catholic history from the 1840s through the 1920s was the contest for control of the church between the French Canadians, based in Quebec, and the English-speaking Irish Canadians (along with smaller numbers of Catholic Scottish Canadians, English, and others) based in Ontario. The French Catholics saw Catholics in general as God&#x27;s chosen people (versus Protestants) and the French as more truly Catholic than any other ethnic group. The fact that the Irish Catholics formed coalition with the anti-French Protestants further infuriated the French.

The Irish Catholics collaborated with Protestants inside Canada, on the school issue: they opposed French language Catholic schools. The Irish had a significant advantage since they were favoured by the Vatican. Irish Catholicism was &quot;ultramontane&quot;, which meant its adherents professed total obedience to the Pope. By contrast, the French bishops in Canada kept their distance from the Vatican. In the form of Regulation 17 this became the central issue that finally alienated the French in Quebec from the Canadian Anglophone establishment during the First World War. Ontario&#x27;s Catholics were led by the Irish Bishop Fallon, who united with the Protestants in opposing French schools. Regulation 17 was repealed in 1927. The French-speakers remain more liberal than the English-speakers to this day, and in addition are also leaving the faith much more quickly.

One by one, the Irish took control of the church in each province except for Quebec. Tensions were especially high in Manitoba at the end of the 19th century. In Alberta in the 1920s, a new Irish bishop undermined French language Catholic schooling, and removed the Francophile order of teaching sisters.

=== Newfoundland ===
In the Dominion of Newfoundland (which was an independent dominion before joining Canada in 1949), politics was polarized around religious lines, with the Protestants confronting the Irish Catholics.

The future Archdiocese of St. John&#x27;s was established on 30 May 1784 as Catholics in Newfoundland gradually gained religious liberty, made explicit by a public declaration by Governor John Campbell. After a request from Irish merchants in St. John&#x27;s to Bishop William Egan, Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, James Louis O&#x27;Donel was appointed Prefect Apostolic of Newfoundland. This was the first Roman Catholic ecclesiastical jurisdiction established in English-speaking North America.

In 1861, the Protestant governor dismissed the Catholic Liberals from office and the ensuing election was marked by riot and disorder with both the Anglican bishop Edward Feild and Catholic bishop John Thomas Mullock taking partisan stances. The Protestants narrowly elected Hugh Hoyles as the Conservative Prime Minister. Hoyles suddenly reversed his long record of militant Protestant activism and worked to defuse tensions. He shared patronage and power with the Catholics; all jobs and patronage were split between the various religious bodies on a per capita basis. This &#x27;denominational compromise&#x27; was further extended to education when all religious schools were put on the basis which the Catholics had enjoyed since the 1840s.

A series of sexual abuse incidents at Mount Cashel Orphanage, a home for boys run by the Congregation of Christian Brothers, and a police coverup were disclosed in 1989, resulting in the closure of the facility in 1990 after the last resident was moved to an alternate facility. The property was seized and the site razed and sold for real-estate development in the mid-1990s as part of a court settlement ordering financial compensation to the victims.

Newfoundland&#x27;s denominational schools were funded by the province until the late 1990s. In the fall of 1998, Newfoundland officially adopted a non-denominational school system, following two referendums and judgements by the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and its Court of Appeal that constitutionally recognized the end of provincially-funded all religious denominational schools.

In July 2021, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland announced plans to sell off assets in order to compensate victims of the Mount Cashel sex abuse scandal.

=== Recent events ===
====Papal visits====
In 1984, John Paul II became the first pope to visit Canada. He would visit the country for a total of three times, his final visit being for World Youth Day 2002 in Toronto. Pope Francis visited in July 2022 to apologize in the wake of the Indian school scandal.

====Decline====
Between 2001 and 2013, the population of Canadians identifying as Catholic remained relatively stagnant, with roughly 12.8 million Canadians self-reporting as Catholic. However, Catholics remained the largest single Christian group in Canada. Church attendance across the Canadian Catholic Church is declining as society becomes more irreligious, resulting in closures of increasing numbers of churches in all provinces and territories in the country.

==== Indian schools scandal ====
The Catholic church ran three-quarters of the 130 Indian schools in Canada, in which more than 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend Christian schools with the aim of assimilating them into Canadian society. Disease and hunger was common, and physical and sexual abuse took place, often at the hands of priests and Catholic laypeople. 
The church agreed to pay C$29m in compensation to survivors, but has distributed only C$3.9m, citing poor fundraising efforts. During roughly that same period, however, the church raised C$300m for the construction of new church buildings, including cathedrals, and had more than C$4bn in assets.

Prime minister Justin Trudeau expressed frustration that Pope Francis declined to offer an apology for the Catholic church&#x27;s role in residential schools.&quot;As a Catholic, I am deeply disappointed by the position that the Catholic church has taken now and over the past many years. We expect the church to step up and take responsibility for its role in this and be there to help with the grieving and healing, including with records&quot;.Ground penetrating radar has since discovered more than 1,300 alleged unmarked mass graves at former Indian schools. Four out of five were run by the Catholic Church. The resurfacing of the residential schools and gravesites, combined with the sexual abuse scandals, has led some Canadians to leave the church.

Bishop Donald Bolen, of Regina, said in 2022 that Catholic involvement in the residential school system had caused deep wounds and trauma. &quot;Relations between First Nation Peoples and the Catholic Church in Canada carry the burden of a complicated history that people are still grappling with. Colonisation and the government-funded Residential Schools System left First Nations Peoples [the earliest known inhabitants] with a legacy of marginalisation, where their languages, cultures, traditions and spirituality were suppressed. Catholic involvement in this system, and the waves of suffering experienced by so many Indigenous Peoples, including physical, cultural, spiritual and sexual abuses, have left deep wounds and trauma. There is much that the Catholic Church, the Canadian government, and society are accountable for.&quot; In 2022, during a visit to Canada, Pope Francis apologised for church members&#x27; role in the scandal.

====2021 church burnings====

Following the increased public awareness of the alleged graves and residential schools, four Catholic churches on First Nations reserves in western Canada were destroyed by fires that investigators regarded as suspicious. Other churches were damaged by fire and vandalism over June and July 2021, with the burnings drawing condemnation from both the Catholic Church and Canadian indigenous figures.

==Population==

The Catholic population in Canada in 2001, 2011, and 2021.

The Catholic population underwent its first recorded drop between 2001 and 2011. Notable trends include the de-Catholicization of Quebec, a drop in the Catholic population in small provinces with stagnant populations, and a rise in Catholics in the large English-speaking provinces of Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta. There are also adherents of Eastern Catholic Churches who had already migrated to Canada, most notably the Ukrainians.

== Organization ==

The Catholic Community in Canada is decentralised, meaning each diocesan bishop is autonomous and is related but not accountable to the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB). According to the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, Canada is divided in four Episcopal assemblies: the Atlantic Episcopal Assembly, the Assemblée des évêques catholiques du Québec, the Assembly of Catholic Bishops of Ontario and the Assembly of Western Catholic Bishops. The Pope is represented in Canada by the Apostolic Nunciature to Canada (Ottawa).
