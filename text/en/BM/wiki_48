<text>Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law is an American adult animated television sitcom created by Michael Ouweleen and Erik Richter for Cartoon Network&#x27;s late-night programming block, Adult Swim. The first season of &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; is the first adult animated production to be produced by Cartoon Network Studios. A spin-off of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, the series revolves around Harvey Birdman, originally a superhero from &quot;Birdman and the Galaxy Trio&quot;, and his new career as an attorney, defending characters who had originally been featured in past Hanna-Barbera cartoons.

The pilot first aired as a sneak peek on Cartoon Network on December 30, 2000. The series officially premiered on Adult Swim on September 2, 2001, the night the block launched. It ended on July 22, 2007, with a total of 39 episodes, over the course of four seasons. The entire series has been made available on DVD, and other forms of home media, including on-demand streaming. A special, entitled &quot;Harvey Birdman: Attorney General&quot;, premiered on October 15, 2018, and a spin-off, &quot;Birdgirl&quot;, premiered on April 4, 2021.

==Premise==
&quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; features ex-superhero Harvey Birdman of &quot;Birdman and the Galaxy Trio&quot; as an attorney working for a law firm alongside other cartoon stars from the 1960s and 1970s Hanna-Barbera cartoon series. Harvey&#x27;s clients are also primarily characters taken from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series of the same era.

Many of Birdman&#x27;s nemeses from his former cartoon series appear as attorneys, often representing the opposing side of a given case. Harvey usually fills the role of a criminal defense attorney, though he will act as a civil litigator or other similar roles when the plot calls for it.

The series uses a surrealist style of comedy, featuring characters, objects, and jokes that are briefly introduced and rarely (if ever) referenced thereafter. Because the series relies heavily on popular culture references to classic television animation, &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; constantly delves into parody, featuring clips of these series or specially created scenes which mimic the distinctive style of the animation being referenced.

&quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; is the first Williams Street cartoon to maintain continuity through the entire series. Various episodes reference Harvey&#x27;s (or another superhero&#x27;s) former crime-fighting career. The episode &quot;Turner Classic Birdman&quot; serves to bridge the gap between &quot;Birdman and the Galaxy Trio&quot; and &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;.

Much of the humor is derived from giving superheroes and supervillains more eccentric qualities, such as transforming mad scientist Dr. Myron Reducto into a paranoid prosecutor. Several of the plots revolve around popular myths about classic Hanna-Barbera characters, such as Shaggy and Scooby-Doo being recreational drug users.

==Voice cast==

* Gary Cole as Harvey Birdman, Judge Hiram Mightor
* Stephen Colbert as Phil Ken Sebben, Myron Reducto
* Thomas Michael Allen as Peanut
* Paget Brewster as Judy Ken Sebben/Birdgirl

* Peter MacNicol as X the Eliminator

==Episodes==

==Production==
&quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; creators Michael Ouweleen and Erik Richter were originally writers for &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, which is where the titular character made his debut. The show was Adult Swim&#x27;s most expensive original series at the time, and is the most expensive spin-off of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;.

Although the first season was animated using digital ink and paint, the remaining seasons were animated using Adobe After Effects. The reason for the switch was that the animation studio was having difficulty maintaining the fast pace of the show, and thus the production of episodes slowed down due to constant retakes.

By animating the later episodes at Turner Studios in Atlanta with Adobe Flash, not only were problems corrected more quickly, but production costs were much lower.

==International broadcast==
In Canada, &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney At Law&quot; previously aired on Teletoon&#x27;s Teletoon at Night block and later G4&#x27;s Adult Digital Distraction block. The series currently airs on the Canadian version of Adult Swim.

==Reception==
In 2009, &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; was named the 91st-best animated series by IGN. They called the concept of the show &quot;wonderful&quot; and the show as a whole &quot;especially clever.&quot; The review summarized that &quot;&quot;Harvey Birdman&quot; worked as both a parody and homage to these animated characters we know and love, with plenty of funny, surreal jokes along the way.&quot;

==Home media==
Each DVD is in the shape of a law book. Each season&#x27;s box art is nearly identical; the only change for each season is the background colour (&quot;Volume One&quot; is brown purple, &quot;Volume Two&quot; is blue, and &quot;Volume Three&quot; is black). The small picture next to the title and the title itself also appears different. In April 2005, Adult Swim had a &quot;Do Our Work For Us&quot; contest for &quot;Harvey Birdman&quot; Season 1 on DVD. The objective of the contest was to ask viewers to make their own fan-made promo commercial for the then-upcoming DVD.

The series is also available on Max.

==Music==
The theme song is an edited version of the song &quot;Slow Moody Blues&quot; written by Reg Tilsley. Other notable songs used in the show include Charlie Steinman&#x27;s &quot;It Is Such a Good Night&quot; (also known as &quot;Scoobidoo Love&quot;) and a lyricless version of Gianni Morandi&#x27;s &quot;La Mia Mania&quot; (also known as &quot;Okay Maria&quot;).

==Other media==
===Video game===

A video game based on the series has been released for the PlayStation 2, Wii and PlayStation Portable video game consoles. It was developed by High Voltage Software and published by Capcom, with gameplay mechanics similar to Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Ace Attorney&quot; series. It was released on January 8, 2008, and includes five new, interactive cases.

===Special===

On May 14, 2018, it was announced that there would be an upcoming special based on the series entitled &quot;Harvey Birdman: Attorney General&quot;. In the special, Harvey Birdman becomes the next Attorney General of the United States, under President Phil Ken Sebben. The original voice cast returned for the special. It premiered at midnight on October 15, 2018.

===Spin-off===

On May 9, 2019, a spin-off entitled &quot;Birdgirl&quot; was announced, following Judy Ken Sebben/Birdgirl in her new role as the CEO of Sebben &amp; Sebben. It premiered on April 4, 2021, with a second season premiering June 19, 2022.

<text>Mary Toft (née Denyer; baptised 21 February 1703 – January 1763), also spelled Tofts, was an English woman from Godalming, Surrey, who in 1726 became the subject of considerable controversy when she tricked doctors into believing that she had given birth to rabbits.

In 1726, Toft became pregnant, but following her reported fascination with the sighting of a rabbit, she miscarried. Her claim to have given birth to various animal parts prompted the arrival of John Howard, a local surgeon, who investigated the matter. He delivered several pieces of animal flesh and duly notified other prominent physicians, which brought the case to the attention of Nathaniel St. André, surgeon to the Royal Household of King George I. St. André concluded that Toft&#x27;s case was genuine but the king also sent surgeon Cyriacus Ahlers, who remained sceptical. By then quite famous, Toft was brought to London where she was studied in detail; under intense scrutiny and producing no more rabbits she confessed to the hoax, and was subsequently imprisoned as a fraud.

The resultant public mockery created panic within the medical profession and ruined the careers of several prominent surgeons. The affair was satirised on many occasions, not least by the pictorial satirist and social critic William Hogarth, who was notably critical of the medical profession&#x27;s gullibility. Toft was eventually released without charge and returned home. The scandal left a lasting impact on public trust in the medical field, contributing to widespread scepticism about the competence and ethics of physicians during that era.

==Account==
The story first came to the public&#x27;s attention in late October 1726, when reports began to reach London. An account appeared in the &quot;Mist&#x27;s Weekly Journal&quot;, on 19November 1726:

The &#x27;poor Woman&#x27;, Mary Toft, was twenty-four or twenty-five years old. She was baptised Mary Denyer on 21 February 1703, the daughter of John and Jane Denyer. In 1720 she married Joshua Toft, a journeyman clothier and together the couple had three children, Mary, Anne and James. As an 18th-century English peasant, circumstances dictated that when in 1726 Toft again became pregnant, she continued working in the fields. She complained of painful complications early in the pregnancy and in early August several pieces of flesh, one &quot;as big as my arm&quot;. This may have been the result of an abnormality of the developing placenta, which would have caused the embryo to stop developing and blood clots and flesh to be ejected. Toft went into labour on 27 September. Her neighbour was called and watched as she produced several animal parts. This neighbour then showed the pieces to her mother and to her mother-in-law, Ann Toft, who in contemporary accounts of the affair is named as a local midwife despite not being officially listed as one in the parish register or the list of women who received a Bishop’s license It is possible that Ann, who had twelve children, unofficially assisted local poorer women with childbirth on the basis of her knowledge and experiences. Ann Toft sent the flesh to John Howard, a Guildford-based man-midwife of thirty years&#x27; experience.

Initially, Howard dismissed the notion that Toft had given birth to animal parts, but the next day, despite his reservations, he went to see her. Ann Toft showed him more pieces of the previous night&#x27;s exertions, but on examining Mary, he found nothing. When Mary again went into labour, appearing to give birth to several more animal parts, Howard returned to continue his investigations. According to a contemporary account of 9November, over the next few days he delivered &quot;three legs of a Cat of a Tabby Colour, and one leg of a Rabbet: the guts were as a Cat&#x27;s and in them were three pieces of the Back-Bone of an Eel ... The cat&#x27;s feet supposed were formed in her imagination from a cat she was fond of that slept on the bed at night.&quot; Toft seemingly became ill once more and over the next few days delivered more pieces of rabbit.

As the story became more widely known, on 4November Henry Davenant, a member of the court of King George I, went to see for himself what was happening. He examined the samples Howard had collected and returned to London, ostensibly a believer. Howard had Toft moved to Guildford, where he offered to deliver rabbits in the presence of anyone who doubted her story. Some of the letters he wrote to Davenant to notify him of any progress in the case came to the attention of Nathaniel St. André, since 1723 a Swiss surgeon to the Royal Household. St. André would ultimately detail the contents of one of these letters in his pamphlet, &quot;A short narrative of an extraordinary delivery of rabbets&quot; (1727):

==Investigation==

By the middle of November the British Royal Family were so interested in the story that they sent St. André and Samuel Molyneux, secretary to the Prince of Wales, to investigate. Apparently, they were not disappointed; arriving on 15November they were taken by Howard to see Toft, who within hours delivered a rabbit&#x27;s torso. St. André&#x27;s account details his examination of the rabbit. To check if it had breathed air, he placed a piece of its lung in water to see if it would float—which it did. St. André then performed a medical examination on Toft, and concluded that the rabbits were bred in her fallopian tubes.

In the doctors&#x27; absence, Toft later that day reportedly delivered the torso of another rabbit, which the two also examined. They again returned that evening to find Toft again displaying violent contractions. A further medical examination followed, and St. André delivered some rabbit skin, followed a few minutes later by a rabbit&#x27;s head. Both men inspected the egested pieces of flesh, noting that some resembled the body parts of a cat.

Fascinated, the king then sent surgeon Cyriacus Ahlers to Guildford. Ahlers arrived on 20November and found Toft exhibiting no signs of pregnancy. He may have already suspected the affair was a hoax and observed that Toft seemed to press her knees and thighs together, as if to prevent something from &quot;dropping down&quot;. He thought Howard&#x27;s behaviour just as suspicious, as the man-midwife would not let him help deliver the rabbits—although Ahlers was not a man-midwife and in an earlier attempt had apparently put Toft through considerable pain. Convinced the affair was a hoax, he lied, telling those involved that he believed Toft&#x27;s story, before making his excuses and returning to London, taking specimens of the rabbits with him. Upon closer study, he reportedly found evidence of them having been cut with a man-made instrument, and noted pieces of straw and grain in their droppings.

On 21November Ahlers reported his findings to the king and later to &quot;several Persons of Note and Distinction&quot;. Howard wrote to Ahlers the next day, asking for the return of his specimens. Ahlers&#x27; suspicions began to worry both Howard and St. André, and apparently the king, as two days later St. André and a colleague were ordered back to Guildford. Upon their arrival they met Howard, who told St. André that Toft had given birth to two more rabbits. She delivered several portions of what was presumed to be a placenta but she was by then quite ill, and suffering from a constant pain in the right side of her abdomen.

In a pre-emptive move against Ahlers, St. André collected affidavits from several witnesses, which in effect cast doubt on Ahlers&#x27; honesty, and on 26November gave an anatomical demonstration before the king to support Toft&#x27;s story. According to his pamphlet, neither St. André nor Molyneux suspected any fraudulent activity.

St. André was ordered by the king to travel back to Guildford and to bring Toft to London, so that further investigations could be carried out. He was accompanied by Richard Manningham, a well-known obstetrician who was knighted in 1721, and the second son of Thomas Manningham, Bishop of Chichester. He examined Toft and found the right side of her abdomen slightly enlarged. Manningham also delivered what he thought was a hog&#x27;s bladder—although St. André and Howard disagreed with his identification—but became suspicious as it smelled of urine. Nevertheless, those involved agreed to say nothing in public and on their return to London on 29November lodged Toft in Lacey&#x27;s Bagnio, in Leicester Fields.

==Examination==

Printed in the early days of newspapers, the story became a national sensation, although some publications were sceptical, the &quot;Norwich Gazette&quot; viewing the affair simply as female gossip. Rabbit stew and jugged hare disappeared from the dinner table, while as unlikely as the story sounded, many physicians felt compelled to see Toft for themselves. The political writer John Hervey later told his friend Henry Fox that:
Under St. André&#x27;s strict control, Toft was studied by a number of eminent physicians and surgeons, including John Maubray. In &quot;The Female Physician&quot; Maubray had proposed women could give birth to a creature he named a sooterkin. He was a proponent of maternal impression, a widely held belief that conception and pregnancy could be influenced by what the mother dreamt, or saw, and warned pregnant women that over-familiarity with household pets could cause their children to resemble those pets. He was reportedly happy to attend Toft, pleased that her case appeared to vindicate his theories, but man-midwife James Douglas, like Manningham, presumed that the affair was a hoax and despite St. André&#x27;s repeated invitations, kept his distance.

Douglas was one of the country&#x27;s most respected anatomists and a well-known man-midwife, whereas St. André was often considered to be a member of the court only because of his ability to speak the king&#x27;s native German. St. André therefore desperately wanted the two to attend Toft; after George I&#x27;s accession to the throne the Whigs had become the dominant political faction, and Manningham and Douglas&#x27;s Whig affiliations and medical knowledge might have elevated his status as both doctor and philosopher. Douglas thought that a woman giving birth to rabbits was as likely as a rabbit giving birth to a human child, but despite his scepticism he went to see her. When Manningham informed him of the suspected hog&#x27;s bladder, and after he examined Toft, he refused to engage St. André on the matter:

Under constant supervision, Toft went into labour several times, to no avail.

==Confession==
The hoax was uncovered less than a week later on 4 December. Thomas Onslow, 2nd Baron Onslow, had begun an investigation of his own and discovered that for the past month Toft&#x27;s husband, Joshua, had been buying young rabbits. Convinced he had enough evidence to proceed, in a letter to physician Sir Hans Sloane he wrote that the affair had &quot;almost alarmed England&quot; and that he would soon publish his findings. The same day, Thomas Howard, a porter at the bagnio, confessed to Justice of the Peace Sir Thomas Clarges that he had been bribed by Toft&#x27;s sister-in-law, Margaret, to sneak a rabbit into Toft&#x27;s chamber. When arrested and questioned Mary denied the accusation, while Margaret, under Douglas&#x27;s interrogation, claimed that she had obtained the rabbit for eating only.

Manningham examined Toft and thought something remained in the cavity of her uterus, and so he successfully persuaded Clarges to allow her to remain at the bagnio. Douglas, who had by then visited Toft, questioned her on three or four occasions, each time for several hours. After several days of this Manningham threatened to perform a painful operation on her, and on 7December, in the presence of Manningham, Douglas, John Montagu and Frederick Calvert, Toft finally confessed. Following her miscarriage and while her cervix permitted access, an accomplice had inserted into her womb the claws and body of a cat, and the head of a rabbit. They had also invented a story in which Toft claimed that during her pregnancy and while working in a field, she had been startled by a rabbit, and had since become obsessed with rabbits. For later parturitions, animal parts had been inserted into her vagina.

Pressured again by Manningham and Douglas (it was the latter who took her confession), she made a further admission on 8 December and another on 9 December, before being sent to Tothill Fields Bridewell, charged on a statute of Edward III as a &quot;vile cheat and impostor&quot;. In her earlier, unpublished confessions, she blamed the entire affair on a range of other participants, from her mother-in-law to John Howard. She also claimed that a travelling woman told her how to insert the rabbits into her body, and how such a scheme would ensure that she would &quot;never want as long as I liv&#x27;d&quot;. The &quot;British Journal&quot; reported that on 7 January 1727 she appeared at the Courts of Quarter Sessions at Westminster, charged &quot;for being an abominable cheat and imposter in pretending to be delivered of several monstrous births&quot;. Margaret Toft had remained staunch, and refused to comment further. &quot;Mist&#x27;s Weekly Journal&quot; of 24 December 1726 reported that &quot;the nurse has been examined as to the person&#x27;s concerned with her, but either was kept in the dark as to the imposition, or is not willing to disclose what she knows; for nothing can be got from her; so that her resolution shocks others.&quot;

On 7January 1727 John Howard and Mary Toft appeared before the bench, where Howard was fined £800 (£ today). He returned to Surrey and continued his practice, and died in 1755.

Crowds reportedly mobbed Tothill Fields Bridewell for months, hoping to catch a glimpse of the now infamous Toft. By this time she had become quite ill, and while incarcerated had her portrait drawn by John Laguerre. She was ultimately discharged on 8April 1727, as it was unclear as to what charge should have been made against her. The Toft family made no profit from the affair, and Mary Toft returned to Surrey. In February 1728 (recorded as 1727 Old Style), she gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth, noted in the Godalming parish register as her &quot;first child after her pretended Rabett-breeding.&quot; Little is known of Toft&#x27;s later life. She briefly reappeared in 1740 when she was imprisoned for receiving stolen goods. She died in 1763, and her obituary ran in London newspapers alongside those of aristocrats. She was buried in Godalming on 13January 1763.

===Impact on the medical profession===
Following the hoax, the medical profession&#x27;s gullibility became the target of a great deal of public mockery. William Hogarth published &quot;Cunicularii, or The Wise Men of Godliman in Consultation&quot; (1726), which portrays Toft in the throes of labour, surrounded by the tale&#x27;s chief participants. Figure &quot;F&quot; is Toft, &quot;E&quot; is her husband. &quot;A&quot; is St. André, and &quot;D&quot; is Howard. In Dennis Todd&#x27;s &quot;Three Characters in Hogarth&#x27;s Cunicularii and Some Implications&quot; the author concludes that figure &quot;G&quot; is Mary Toft&#x27;s sister-in-law, Margaret Toft. Toft&#x27;s confession of 7December demonstrates her insistence that her sister-in-law played no part in the hoax, but Manningham&#x27;s 1726 &quot;An Exact Diary of what was observ&#x27;d during a Close Attendance upon Mary Toft, the pretended Rabbet-Breeder of Godalming in Surrey&quot; offers eyewitness testimony of her complicity. Hogarth&#x27;s print was not the only image that ridiculed the affair—George Vertue published &quot;The Surrey-Wonder&quot;, and &quot;The Doctors in Labour, or a New Wim-Wam in Guildford (12 plates)&quot;, a broadsheet published in 1727 which satirises St. André, was also popular at the time.

The timing of Toft&#x27;s confession proved awkward (and unfortunate) for St. André, who on 3December had published his forty-page pamphlet &quot;A Short Narrative of an Extraordinary Delivery of Rabbets&quot;. On this document the surgeon had staked his reputation, and although it offers a more empirical account of the Toft case than earlier more fanciful publications about reproduction in general, ultimately it was derided. Ahlers, his scepticism justified, published &quot;Some observations concerning the woman of Godlyman in Surrey&quot;, which details his account of events and his suspicion of the complicity of both St. André and Howard.

St. André recanted his views on 9December 1726. In 1729, following the death of Samuel Molyneux, he married Molyneux&#x27;s widow, Elizabeth. This did little to impress his peers. Molyneux&#x27;s cousin accused him of the poisoning, a charge that St. André defended by suing for defamation, but the careers of St. André and his wife were permanently damaged. Elizabeth lost her attendance on Queen Caroline, and St. André was publicly humiliated at court. Living on Elizabeth&#x27;s considerable wealth, they retired to the country, where St. André died in 1776, aged 96. Manningham, desperate to exculpate himself, published a diary of his observations of Mary Toft, together with an account of her confession of the fraud, on 12December. In it he suggested that Douglas had been fooled by Toft, and concerned with his image Douglas replied by publishing his own account. Using the pseudonym &#x27;Lover of Truth and Learning&#x27;, in 1727 Douglas also published &quot;The Sooterkin Dissected&quot;. A letter to Maubray, Douglas was scathingly critical of his sooterkin theory, calling it &quot;a mere fiction of your [Maubray&#x27;s] brain&quot;. The damage done to the medical profession was such that several doctors not connected with the tale felt compelled to print statements that they had not believed Toft&#x27;s story. 
The case was cited by Robert Walpole&#x27;s opponents as symbolising the age, which they perceived as greedy, corrupt and deceitful. One author, writing to the Prince of Wales&#x27;s mistress, suggested the story was a political portent of the approaching death of the prince&#x27;s father. On 7January 1727 &quot;Mist&#x27;s Weekly Journal&quot; satirised the matter, making several allusions to political change, and comparing the affair to the events of 1641 when Parliament began its revolution against King Charles I. The scandal provided the writers of Grub Street with enough material to produce pamphlets, squibs, broadsides and ballads for several months. With publications such as &quot;St. André&#x27;s Miscarriage&quot; (1727) and &quot;The anatomist dissected: or the man-midwife finely brought to bed&quot; (1727) satirists scorned the objectivity of men-midwives, and critics of Toft&#x27;s attendants questioned their integrity, undermining their profession with sexual puns and allusions. The case raised questions about England&#x27;s status as an &quot;enlightened&quot; nation—Voltaire used the case in his brief essay &quot;Singularités de la nature&quot; to describe how the Protestant English were still influenced by an ignorant Church.

===Legacy===
Toft did not escape the ire of the satirists, who concentrated mainly on sexual innuendo. Some took advantage of a common 18th-century word for a rabbit track—prick—and others were scatological in nature. However, &quot;Much Ado about Nothing; or, A Plain Refutation of All that Has Been Written or Said Concerning the Rabbit-Woman of Godalming&quot; (1727) is one of the more cutting satires on Toft. The document supposes to be the confession of &#x27;Merry Tuft&#x27;, &quot;... in her own Stile and Spelling&quot;. Poking fun at her illiteracy, it makes a number of obscene suggestions hinting at her promiscuity—&quot;I wos a Wuman as had grate nattural parts, and a large Capassiti, and kapible of being kunserned in depe Kuntrivansis.&quot; The document also ridicules several of the physicians involved in the affair, and reflects the general view portrayed by the satirists that Toft was a weak woman and the least complicit of &quot;the offenders&quot; (regardless of her guilt). The notion contrasts with that expressed of her before the hoax was revealed and may indicate an overall strategy to disempower Toft completely. This is reflected in one of the most notable satires of the affair, Alexander Pope and William Pulteney&#x27;s anonymous satirical ballad &quot;The Discovery; or, The Squire Turn&#x27;d Ferret&quot;. Published in 1726 and aimed at Samuel Molyneux, it rhymes &quot;hare&quot; with &quot;hair&quot;, and &quot;money&quot; with &quot;conney&quot;. The ballad opens with the following verse:

In 2019, &quot;Mary Toft; or the Rabbit Queen&quot; was written by Dexter Palmer. In the novel, Toft is abused by her husband. Another novel, &quot;Mary and the Rabbit Dream&quot; by Noémi Kiss-Deáki, was published in 2024. This book also features a fictionalized account of Toft&#x27;s life. Toft is portrayed sympathetically as a desperate woman dealing with hardship. A writer for &quot;The Spectator&quot; described these books as demonstrating that &quot;Toft&#x27;s grotesque story still captivates us&quot;.

<text>Pu&#x27;er or pu-erh is a variety of fermented tea traditionally produced in Yunnan Province, China. In the context of traditional Chinese tea production terminology, fermentation refers to microbial fermentation (called &#x27;wet piling&#x27;), and is typically applied after the tea leaves have been sufficiently dried and rolled. As the tea undergoes controlled microbial fermentation, it also continues to oxidize, which is also controlled, until the desired flavors are reached. This process produces tea known as &quot;hēichá&quot; (黑茶), literally &quot;black tea&quot;, though the term is commonly translated to English as &quot;dark tea&quot; to distinguish it from the English-language &quot;black tea&quot; (紅茶 &quot;hóngchá&quot;, lit. &quot;red tea&quot; in Chinese), which it is not.

Most teas, although described as fermented, are actually oxidised by enzymes present in the tea plant. Pu&#x27;er is instead fermented microbially by molds, bacteria and yeasts present on the harvested leaves of the tea plant, and thus is truly fermented.

There are two main styles of pu&#x27;er production: a traditional, longer production process known as &quot;shēng&quot; (&quot;raw&quot;) pu&#x27;er; and a modern, accelerated production process known as &quot;shóu&quot; (&quot;ripe&quot;) pu&#x27;er. Pu&#x27;er traditionally begins with a raw product called &quot;rough&quot; (&quot;máo&quot;) &quot;chá&quot; (毛茶, lit. fuzzy/furry tea) and can be sold in this form or pressed into a number of shapes and sold as &quot;&quot;shēng chá&quot; (生茶, lit. raw tea). Both of these forms then undergo the complex process of gradual fermentation and maturation with time. The &quot;wòduī&quot; (渥堆) fermentation process developed in 1973 by the Kunming Tea Factory created a new type of pu&#x27;er tea. This process involves an accelerated fermentation into &quot;shóu&quot; (or &quot;shú&quot;) &quot;chá&quot; (熟茶, lit. ripe tea) that is then stored loose or pressed into various shapes. The fermentation process was adopted at the Menghai Tea Factory shortly after and technically developed there. The legitimacy of shóu chá is disputed by some traditionalists when compared to the traditionally longer-aged teas, such as shēng chá.

Pu’er can be stored and permitted to age and to mature, like wine, in non-airtight containers before consumption. This is why it has long been standard practice to label all types of pu’er with the year and region of production.


== Name ==
&quot;Pu&#x27;er&quot; is the pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of Chinese &quot;Pu-erh&quot; is a variant of the Wade-Giles romanization (properly &quot;p‘u-êrh&quot;) of the same name. In Hong Kong, the same Chinese characters are read as Bo-lei, and this is therefore a common alternative English term for this tea. The tea got its name from the ancient tea-trading town of Pu&#x27;er (普洱), which is today&#x27;s Ning&#x27;er Town (宁洱镇) in Ning&#x27;er County, Pu&#x27;er prefecture-level city of Yunnan. Pu&#x27;er County had its name changed to Simao, after Simao Town, the new county seat in 1950 following the Communist victory. The County of Simao became a prefecture level City and had its name changed to Pu&#x27;er in 2007. Although the urban center of the modern Pu&#x27;er City remained in Simao, the whole Pu&#x27;er region is now sometimes considered the appellation for pu&#x27;er proper.

Pu&#x27;er (and all tea) terminology varies from language to language. For example, pu-er is known in Chinese as a type of &#x27;dark tea&#x27; (heicha) while in Spanish it is considered ‘té rojo’ (red tea) and, conversely, what in Chinese is called &#x27;red tea&#x27; (hongcha) is known in Spanish as &#x27;té negro&#x27; (black tea).

== History ==

Fermented tea leaves have had a long history among ethnic groups in southwest China. These crude teas were of various origins and were meant to be low cost. The Bulang and Dai people of Yunnan Province have produced pu&#x27;er tea at Jingmai Mountain since at least the 10th century. Traditionally, the tea trees would be planted in the forest understory after some larger trees were removed. On the border of these old tea forests, a partition forest would be planted to protect against the spread of pests and diseases, with cultivated land for crops and vegetables at lower altitudes. Darkened tea, or &quot;hēichá&quot;, is still the major beverage for the ethnic groups in the southwestern borders and, until the early 1990s, was the third major tea category produced by China mainly for this market segment. Because of the cultural significance of pu&#x27;er tea, its unique cultivation process, and the unbroken history of growing tea at Jingmai Mountain, it was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2023.

There had been no standardized processing for the darkening of &quot;hēichá&quot; until the postwar years in the 1950s, when there was a sudden surge in demand in Hong Kong, perhaps because of the concentration of refugees from the mainland. In the 1970s the improved process was taken back to Yunnan for further development, which has resulted in the various production styles variously referred to as &quot;wòduī&quot; today. This new process produced a finished product in a matter of months that many thought tasted similar to teas aged naturally for 10–15 years and so this period saw a demand-driven boom in the production of &quot;hēichá&quot; by the artificial ripening method.

In recent decades, demand has come full circle and it has become more common again for &quot;hēichá&quot;, including pu&#x27;er, to be sold as the raw product without the artificial accelerated fermentation process.

== Processing ==

Pu&#x27;er tea processing, although straightforward, is complicated by the fact that the tea itself falls into two distinct categories: the &quot;raw&quot; shēngchá and the &quot;ripe&quot; shóuchá. All types of pu&#x27;er tea are created from &quot;máochá&quot; ( ), a mostly unoxidized green tea processed from &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; var. &quot;assamica&quot;, which is the large leaf type of Chinese tea found in the mountains of southern and western Yunnan (in contrast to the small leaf type of tea used for typical green, oolong, black, and yellow teas found in the other parts of China).

Máochá can be sold directly to market as loose leaf tea, compressed to produce &quot;raw&quot; &quot;shēngchá&quot;, naturally aged and matured for several years before being compressed to also produce &quot;raw&quot; &quot;shēngchá&quot; or undergo wòduī ripening for several months prior to being compressed to produce &quot;ripe&quot; &quot;shóuchá&quot;. While unaged and unprocessed, Máochá pǔ&#x27;ěr is similar to green tea. Two subtle differences worth noting are that pǔ&#x27;ěr is not produced from the small-leaf Chinese varietal but the broad-leaf varietal mostly found in the southern Chinese provinces and India. The second is that pǔ&#x27;ěr leaves are picked as one bud and 3-4 leaves whilst green tea is picked as one bud and 1-2 leaves. This means that older leaves contribute to the qualities of pǔ&#x27;ěr tea.

Ripened or aged raw pǔ&#x27;ěr has occasionally been mistakenly categorized as a subcategory of black tea due to the dark red color of its leaves and liquor. However, pǔ&#x27;ěr in both its ripened and aged forms has undergone secondary oxidization and fermentation caused both by organisms growing in the tea and free-radical oxidation, thus making it a unique type of tea. This divergence in production style not only makes the flavor and texture of pu&#x27;er tea different but also results in a rather different chemical makeup of the resulting brewed liquor.

The fermented dark tea, hēichá (黑茶), is one of the six classes of tea in China, and &quot;pǔ&#x27;ěr&quot; is classified as a dark tea (defined as fermented), something which is resented by some who argue for a separate category for &quot;pǔ&#x27;ěr&quot; tea. As of 2008, only the large-leaf variety from Yunnan can be called a &quot;pǔ&#x27;ěr&quot;.

Pu&#x27;er is typically made through two steps. First, all leaves must be roughly processed into &quot;maocha&quot; to stop oxidation. From there it may be further processed by fermentation, or directly packaged. Summarising the steps:
* Maocha: Killing Green (杀青) -- Rolling (揉捻) -- Sun Drying (晒干)
*# green/raw (生普, sheng cha)
*# dark/ripe (熟普, shu cha): -- Piling(渥堆))-- Drying(干燥))
Both sheng and ripe pu&#x27;er can be shaped into cakes or bricks and aged with time.

=== &quot;Maocha&quot; or rough tea ===
The intent of the &quot;máochá &quot; stage ( or ; literally, &quot;light green rough tea&quot; or &quot;rough tea&quot; respectively) is to dry the leaves and keep them from spoiling. It involves minimal processing and there is no fermentation involved.

The first step in making raw or ripened pu&#x27;er is picking appropriate tender leaves. Plucked leaves are handled gingerly to prevent bruising and unwanted oxidation. It is optional to wilt/wither the leaves after picking and it depends on the tea processor, as drying occurs at various stages of processing. If so, the leaves would be spread out in the sun, weather permitting, or a ventilated space to wilt and remove some of the water content. On overcast or rainy days, the leaves will be wilted by light heating, a slight difference in processing that will affect the quality of the resulting &quot;maocha&quot; and pu&#x27;er.
The leaves are then dry-roasted using a large wok in a process called &quot;killing the green&quot; ( ; pinyin: &quot;shā qīng&quot;), which arrests most enzyme activity in the leaf and prevents full oxidation. After pan-roasting, the leaves are rolled, rubbed, and shaped into strands through several steps to lightly bruise the tea and then left to dry in the sun. Unlike green tea produced in China which is dried with hot air after the pan-frying stage to completely kill enzyme activity, leaves used in the production of pu&#x27;er are not air-dried after pan-roasting, which leaves a small amount of enzymes which contribute a minor amount of oxidation to the leaves during sun-drying. The bruising of the tea is also important in helping this minimal oxidation to occur, and both of these steps are significant in contributing to the unique characteristics of pu&#x27;er tea.

Once dry, &quot;máochá &quot; can be sent directly to the factory to be pressed into raw pu&#x27;er, or to undergo further processing to make fermented or ripened pu&#x27;er. Sometimes &quot;Mao Cha&quot; is sold directly as loose-leaf &quot;raw&quot; Sheng Cha or it can be matured in loose-leaf form, requiring only two to three years due to the faster rate of natural fermentation in an uncompressed state. This tea is then pressed into numerous shapes and sold as a more matured &quot;raw&quot; Sheng Cha.

=== Pressing ===

To produce pu&#x27;er, many additional steps are needed prior to the actual pressing of the tea. First, a specific quantity of dry &quot;máochá&quot; or ripened tea leaves pertaining to the final weight of the &quot;bingcha&quot; is weighed out. The dry tea is then lightly steamed in perforated cans to soften and make it more tacky. This will allow it to hold together and not crumble during compression. A ticket, called a &quot;nèi fēi&quot; ( ) or additional adornments, such as colored ribbons, are placed on or in the midst of the leaves and inverted into a cloth bag or wrapped in cloth. The pouch of tea is gathered inside the cloth bag and wrung into a ball, with the extra cloth tied or coiled around itself. This coil or knot is what produces the dimpled indentation at the reverse side of a tea cake when pressed. Depending on the shape of the pu&#x27;er being produced, a cotton bag may or may not be used. For instance, brick or square teas often are not compressed using bags.

Pressing can be done by:
* A press. In the past, hand lever presses were used, but were largely superseded by hydraulic presses. The press forces the tea into a metal form that is occasionally decorated with a motif in sunken-relief. Due to its efficiency, this method is used to make almost all forms of pressed pu&#x27;er. Tea can be pressed either with or without it being bagged, with the latter done by using a metal mould. Tightly compressed &quot;bǐng&quot;, formed directly into a mold without bags using this method are known as &quot;tié bǐng&quot; ( , literally &quot;iron cake/puck&quot;) due to its density and hardness. The taste of densely compressed raw pu&#x27;er is believed to benefit from careful aging for up to several decades.
* A large heavy stone, carved into the shape of a short cylinder with a handle, simply weighs down a bag of tea on a wooden board. The tension from the bag and the weight of the stone together give the tea its rounded and sometimes non-uniform edge. This method of pressing is often referred to as: &quot;hand&quot; or &quot;stone-pressing&quot;, and is how many artisanal &quot;pu&#x27;er bǐng&quot; are still manufactured.

Pressed pu&#x27;er is removed from the cloth bag and placed on latticed shelves, where they are allowed to air dry, which may take several weeks or months, depending on the wetness of the pressed cakes. The pu&#x27;er cakes are then individually wrapped by hand, and packed.

=== Fermentation ===
Pu&#x27;er is a microbially fermented tea obtained through the action of molds, bacteria and yeasts on the harvested leaves of the tea plant. It is thus truly a fermented tea, whereas teas known in the west as black teas (known in China as Red teas) have only undergone large-scale oxidation through naturally occurring tea plant enzymes. Mislabelling the oxidation process as fermentation and thus naming black teas, such as Assam, Darjeeling or Keemun, as fermented teas has long been a source of confusion. Only tea such as pu&#x27;er, that has undergone microbial processing, can correctly be called a fermented tea.

Pu&#x27;er undergoes what is known as a solid-state fermentation where water activity is low to negligible. Both endo-oxidation (enzymes derived from the tea-leaves themselves) and exo-oxidation (microbial catalysed) of tea polyphenols occurs. The microbes are also responsible for metabolising the carbohydrates and amino acids present in the tea leaves. Although the microbes responsible have proved highly variable from region to region and even factory to factory, the key organism found and responsible for almost all pu&#x27;er fermentation has been identified in numerous studies as &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot;, with some highlighting the possibility of ochratoxins produced by the metabolism of some strains of &quot;A.niger&quot; having a potentially harmful effect through consumption of pu&#x27;er tea. This notion has recently been refuted through a systematic chromosome analysis of the species attributed to many East Asian fermentations, including those that involve pu&#x27;er, where the authors have reclassified the organisms involved as &quot;Aspergillus luchuensis&quot;. It is apparent that this species does not have the gene sequence for coding ochratoxin and thus pu&#x27;er tea should be considered safe for human consumption.

=== Ripe and raw pu&#x27;er ===
&quot;Ripened&quot; Shu Cha (熟茶) tea is pressed &quot;maocha&quot; that has been specially processed to imitate aged &quot;raw&quot; Sheng Cha tea. Although it is also known in English as cooked pu&#x27;er, the process does not actually employ cooking to imitate the aging process. The term may be due to inaccurate translation, as &quot;shóu&quot; (熟) means both &quot;fully cooked&quot; and &quot;fully ripened&quot;.

The process used to convert &quot;máochá&quot; into ripened pu&#x27;er manipulates conditions to approximate the result of the aging process by prolonged bacterial and fungal fermentation in a warm humid environment under controlled conditions, a technique called &quot;wò duī&quot; (, &quot;wet piling&quot; in English), which involves piling, dampening, and turning the tea leaves in a manner much akin to composting. Studies have shown that the soil suitable for planting Pu&#x27;er tea trees is slightly acidic soil with loose soil, deep soil layer, good drainage and ventilation.

The piling, wetting, and mixing of the piled &quot;máochá&quot; ensures even fermentation. The bacterial and fungal cultures found in the fermenting piles were found to vary widely from factory to factory throughout Yunnan, consisting of multiple strains of &quot;Aspergillus&quot; spp., &quot;Penicillium&quot; spp., yeasts, and a wide range of other microflora. Control over the multiple variables in the ripening process, particularly humidity and the growth of &quot;Aspergillus&quot; spp., is key in producing ripened pu&#x27;er of high quality. Poor control in fermentation/oxidation process can result in bad ripened pu&#x27;er, characterized by badly decomposed leaves and an aroma and texture reminiscent of compost. The ripening process typically takes between 45 and 60 days on average.

The &quot;wò duī&quot; process was first developed in 1973 by Menghai Tea Factory and Kunming Tea Factory to imitate the flavor and color of aged raw pu&#x27;er, and was an adaptation of wet storage techniques used by merchants to artificially simulate ageing of their teas. Mass production of ripened pu&#x27;er began in 1975. It can be consumed without further aging, or it can be stored further to &quot;air out&quot; some of the less savory flavors and aromas acquired during fermentation. The tea is sold both in flattened and loose form. Some tea collectors believe &quot;ripened&quot; Shou Cha should not be aged for more than a decade.

Wet pile fermented pu&#x27;er has higher levels of caffeine and much higher levels of gallic acid than traditionally aged raw pu&#x27;er; traditionally aged pu&#x27;er has higher levels of the antioxidant and carcinogen-trapping epigallocatechin gallate as well as (+)-catechin, (–)-epicatechin, (–)-epigallocatechin, gallocatechin gallate, and epicatechin gallate than wet pile fermented pu&#x27;er. Wet pile fermented pu&#x27;er has much lower total levels for all catechins than traditional pu&#x27;er and other teas except for black tea, which also has low total catechins.

== Classification ==
Aside from vintage year, pu&#x27;er tea can be classified in a variety of ways: by shape, processing method, region, cultivation, grade, and season.

=== Shape ===
Pu&#x27;er is compressed into a variety of shapes. Other lesser seen forms include: stacked &quot;melon pagodas&quot;, pillars, calabashes, &quot;yuanbao&quot;, and small tea bricks (2–5 cm in width). Pu&#x27;er is also compressed into the hollow centers of bamboo stems or packed and bound into a ball inside the peel of various citrus fruits (&quot;Xiaoqinggan&quot;) or sold as nuggets (&quot;Suiyinzi&quot; 碎银子 or &quot;fossilized tea&quot; 茶化石) or bundles made from tea at the center of wet piles (&quot;Laotoucha&quot; 老头茶).

=== Process and oxidation ===
Pu&#x27;er teas are often collectively classified in Western tea markets as post-fermentation, and in Eastern markets as black teas, but there is general confusion due to improper use of the terms &quot;oxidation&quot; and &quot;fermentation&quot;. Typically black tea is termed &quot;fully fermented&quot;, which is incorrect as the process used to create black tea is oxidation and does not involve microbial activity. Black teas are fully oxidized, green teas are unoxidized, and Oolong teas are partially oxidized to varying degrees.

All pu&#x27;er teas undergo some oxidation during sun drying and then become either:
# Fully fermented with microbes during a processing phase which is largely anaerobic, i.e. without the presence of oxygen. This phase is similar to composting and results in Shu (ripened) pu&#x27;er
# Partly fermented by microbial action, and partly oxidized during the natural aging process resulting in Sheng (raw) pu&#x27;er. The aging process depends on how the sheng pu&#x27;er is stored, which determines the degree of fermentation and oxidization achieved.

According to the production process, four main types of pu&#x27;er are commonly available on the market:
* &quot;Maocha&quot;, green pu&#x27;er leaves sold in loose form as the raw material for making pressed pu&#x27;er. Badly processed &quot;maocha&quot; will produce an inferior pu&#x27;er.
* Green/raw pu&#x27;er, pressed &quot;maocha&quot; that has not undergone additional processing; high quality green pu&#x27;er is highly sought by collectors.
* Ripened/cooked pu&#x27;er, &quot;maocha&quot; that has undergone an accelerated fermentation process lasting 45 to 60 days on average. Badly fermented &quot;maocha&quot; will create a muddy tea with fishy and sour flavors indicative of inferior aged pu&#x27;er.
* Aged raw pu&#x27;er, a tea that has undergone a slow secondary oxidation and microbial fermentation. Although all types of pu&#x27;er can be aged, the pressed raw pu&#x27;er is typically the most highly regarded, since aged &quot;maocha&quot; and ripened pu&#x27;er both lack a clean and assertive taste.

=== Flavour ===
Ripe pu&#x27;er is often described by its multiple layers of aroma: &quot;duiwei&quot; (堆味) or fermented flavour, &quot;cangwei&quot; (仓味) or storage flavour, &quot;xingwei&quot; (腥味) or fish flavour and &quot;meiwei&quot; (霉味) moldy flavour. The storage locations (Yunnan, Canton or Hong Kong) and storing conditions (wet versus dry storage) will result in distinct flavours. The aromas can be annotated as camphora (樟香), ginseng (参香), jujube (枣香), costus (木香), minty (荷香) or very aged (陈香). Raw pu&#x27;er is often distinguished by its floral (花香), grassy (草香), fresh (清香), herbal (药香), fruity (水果), or honey (蜜香) aroma.

Some pu&#x27;er are flavour-infused. Sticky rice pu&#x27;er (&quot;nuomixiang&quot;, 糯米香) is infused with leaves of &quot;Strobilanthes tonkinensis&quot;, native to Mengla, which gives it a young rice flavour. Bamboo-roasted pu&#x27;er is encased in bamboo tubes and undergoes a smoking process. Tangerine pu&#x27;er (&quot;xiaoqinggan&quot;, 小青柑) is made with small green tangerines stuffed with tea. Flower-infused pu&#x27;er is made in the form of tea balls (龙珠) or tea cakes.

=== Regions ===

==== Yunnan ====
Pu&#x27;er is produced in almost every county and prefecture in the province. Proper pu&#x27;er is sometimes considered to be limited to that produced in Pu&#x27;er City.

===== Six Great Tea Mountains =====
The best known pu&#x27;er areas are the Six Great Tea Mountains (), a group of mountains in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, renowned for their climates and environments, which not only provide excellent growing conditions for pu&#x27;er, but also produce unique taste profiles (akin to terroir in wine) in the produced pu&#x27;er tea. Over the course of history, the designated mountains for the tea mountains have either been changed or listed differently.

In the Qing dynasty government records for Pu&#x27;er (普洱府志), the oldest historically designated mountains were said to be named after six commemorative items left in the mountains by Zhuge Liang, and using the Chinese characters of the native languages (Hani and Tai) of the region. These mountains are all located northeast of the Lancang River (Mekong) in relatively close proximity to one another. The mountains&#x27; names, in the Standard Chinese character pronunciation are:
# &quot;Gedeng&quot; ( )
# &quot;Yiwu&quot; ( )
# &quot;Mangzhi&quot; ( )
# &quot;Manzhuan&quot; ( )
# &quot;Yibang&quot; ( )
# &quot;Yōulè&quot; ( )

Southwest of the river there are also nine lesser known tea mountains, which are isolated by the river. They are:
# &quot;Mengsong&quot; (勐宋):
# &quot;Pasha&quot; (帕沙):
# &quot;Jingmai&quot; (景迈):
# &quot;Nánnuò&quot; ( ): a varietal of tea grows here called &quot;zĭjuān&quot; ( , literally &quot;purple lady&quot;) whose buds and bud leaves have a purple hue.
# &quot;Bada&quot; (巴达):
# &quot;Hekai&quot; (贺开):
# &quot;Bulangshan&quot; (布朗山):
# &quot;Mannuo&quot; (曼糯):
# &quot;Xiao mengsong&quot; (小勐宋):

For various reasons, around the end of the Qing dynasty and at the beginning of the ROC period (the early twentieth century), tea production in these mountains dropped drastically, either due to large forest fires, overharvesting, prohibitive imperial taxes, or general neglect. To revitalize tea production in the area, the Chinese government in 1962 selected a new group of six great tea mountains that were named based on the more important tea-producing mountains at the time, including Youle mountain from the original six.

===== Other areas of Yunnan =====
Many other areas of Yunnan also produce pu&#x27;er tea. Yunnan prefectures that are major producers of pu&#x27;er include Lincang, Dehong, Simao, Xishuangbanna, and Wenshan. Other notable tea mountains famous in Yunnan include among others:
* &quot;Bāngwǎi&quot; ( )
* &quot;Bānzhāng&quot; ( ): this is not a mountain but a Hani village in the Bulang Mountains, noted for producing powerful and complex teas that are bitter with a sweet aftertaste
* &quot;Yìwǔ&quot; ( )
* &quot;Bada&quot; (巴達山)
* &quot;Wuliang&quot;
* &quot;Ailuo&quot;
* &quot;Jinggu&quot;
* &quot;Baoshan&quot;
* &quot;Yushou&quot;
Region is only one factor in assessing a pu&#x27;er tea, and pu&#x27;er from any region of Yunnan can be as prized as any from the Six Great Tea Mountains if it meets other criteria, such as being wild growth, hand-processed tea.

==== Other provinces ====
While Yunnan produces the majority of pu&#x27;er, other regions of China, including Hunan and Guangdong, have also produced the tea. The Guangyun Gong cake, for example, although the early productions were composed of pure Yunnan &quot;máochá&quot;, after the ‘60s the cakes featured a blend of Yunnan and Guangdong &quot;máochá&quot;, and the most recent production of these cakes contains mostly from the latter.

In late 2008, the Chinese government approved a standard declaring pu&#x27;er tea as a &quot;product with geographical indications&quot;, which would restrict the naming of tea as pu&#x27;er to tea produced within specific regions of the Yunnan province. The standard has been disputed, particularly by producers from Guangdong. Fermented tea in the pu&#x27;er style made outside of Yunnan is often branded as &quot;dark tea&quot; in light of this standard.

==== Other regions ====
In addition to China, border regions touching Yunnan in Vietnam, Laos, and Burma are also known to produce pu&#x27;er tea, though little of this makes its way to the Chinese or international markets.

=== Cultivation ===
The method of cultivation can have as much of an effect on the final product as region or grade. There are three widely used methods of cultivation for pu&#x27;er:
* Plantation bushes (&quot;guànmù&quot;, ; &quot;taídì&quot;, ): Cultivated tea bushes, from the seeds or cuttings of wild tea trees and planted in relatively low altitudes and flatter terrain. The tea produced from these plants are often considered inferior due to the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizer in cultivation, the lack of pleasant flavors, and the presence of bitterness or astringency.
* &quot;Wild arbor&quot; trees (&quot;yěfàng&quot;, ): Though often conflated with wild tree especially by producers, this method involves trees from older plantations that were cultivated in previous generations that have gone feral due to the lack of care. These trees are said to produce teas of better flavor due to the higher levels of secondary metabolites produced in the tea tree. Additionally, the trees are typically cared for using organic practices, which includes the scheduled pruning of the trees in a manner similar to pollarding. Despite the good quality of their produced teas, &quot;wild arbor&quot; trees are often not as prized as truly wild trees.
* &quot;Wild trees&quot; (gŭshù, ; literally &quot;old tree&quot;): Teas from old wild trees, grown without human intervention, are typically the highest valued pu&#x27;er teas. Such teas are valued for having deeper and more complex flavors, often with camphor or &quot;mint&quot; notes, said to be imparted by the many camphor trees that grow in the same environment as the wild tea trees. Young raw pu&#x27;er teas produced from the leaf tips of these trees also lack overwhelming astringency and bitterness often attributed to young pu&#x27;er. Pu&#x27;er made from the distinct but closely related so-called &quot;wild&quot; species &quot;Camellia taliensis&quot; can command a much higher price than pu&#x27;er made from the more common &quot;Camellia sinensis.&quot;

Determining whether or not a tea is wild is a challenging task, made more difficult through the inconsistent and unclear terminology and labeling in Chinese. Terms like &quot;yěshēng&quot; ( ; literally &quot;wild&quot; or &quot;uncultivated&quot;), &quot;qiáomù&quot; ( ; literally &quot;tall tree&quot;), &quot;yěshēng qiáomù&quot; ( ; literally &quot;uncultivated trees&quot;), and &quot;gǔshù&quot; are found on the labels of cakes of both wild and &quot;wild arbor&quot; variety, and on blended cakes, which contain leaves from tea plants of various cultivations. These inconsistent and often misleading labels can easily confuse uninitiated tea buyers regardless of their grasp of the Chinese language. As well, the lack of specific information about tea leaf sources in the printed wrappers and identifiers that come with the pu&#x27;er cake makes identification of the tea a difficult task. Pu&#x27;er journals and similar annual guides such as &quot;The Profound World of Chi Tse&quot;, &quot;Pu-erh Yearbook&quot;, and &quot;Pu-erh Teapot Magazine&quot; contain credible sources for leaf information. Tea factories are generally honest about their leaf sources, but someone without access to tea factory or other information is often at the mercy of the middlemen or vendor. Many pu&#x27;er aficionados seek out and maintain relationships with vendors who they feel they can trust to help mitigate the issue of finding the &quot;truth&quot; of the leaves.

Even in the best of circumstances, when a journal, factory information, and trustworthy vendor all align to assure a tea&#x27;s genuinely wild leaf, fakes teas are common and make the issue even more complicated. Because collectors often doubt the reliability of written information, some believe certain physical aspects of the leaf can point to its cultivation. For example, drinkers cite the evidence of a truly wild old tree in a menthol effect (&quot;camphor&quot; in tea specialist terminology) supposedly caused by the Camphor laurel trees that grow amongst wild tea trees in Yunnan&#x27;s tea forests. As well, the presence of thick veins and sawtooth-edged on the leaves along with camphor flavor elements are taken as signifiers of wild tea.

=== Grade ===
Pu&#x27;er can be sorted into ten or more grades. Generally, grades are determined by leaf size and quality, with higher numbered grades meaning older/larger, broken, or less tender leaves. Grading is rarely consistent between factories, and first grade tea leaves may not necessarily produce first grade cakes. Different grades have different flavors; many bricks blend several grades chosen to balance flavors and strength.

=== Season ===
Harvest season also plays an important role in the flavor of pu&#x27;er. Spring tea is the most highly valued, followed by fall tea, and finally summer tea. Only rarely is pu&#x27;er produced in winter months, and often this is what is called &quot;early spring&quot; tea, as harvest and production follows the weather pattern rather than strict monthly guidelines.

== Tea factories ==
Factories are generally responsible for the production of pu&#x27;er teas. While some individuals oversee small-scale production of high-quality tea, the majority of tea on the market is compressed by factories or tea groups. Until recently factories were all state-owned and under the supervision of the &quot;China National Native Produce &amp; Animal Byproducts Import &amp; Export Corporation&quot; (CNNP), Yunnan Tea Branch. Kunming Tea Factory, Menghai Tea Factory, Pu&#x27;er Tea Factory and Xiaguan Tea Factory are the most notable of these state-owned factories. While CNNP still operates today, few factories are state-owned, and CNNP contracts out much production to privately owned factories.

Different tea factories have earned good reputations. Menghai Tea Factory and Xiaguan Tea Factory, which date from the 1940s, have enjoyed good reputations, but in the twenty-first century face competition from many of the newly emerging private factories. For example, Haiwan Tea Factory, founded by former Menghai Factory owner Zhou Bing Liang in 1999, has a good reputation, as do Changtai Tea Group, Mengku Tea Company, and other new tea makers formed in the 1990s. However, due to production inconsistencies and variations in manufacturing techniques, the reputation of a tea company or factory can vary depending on the year or the specific cakes produced during a year.

The producing factory is often the first or second item listed when referencing a pu&#x27;er cake, the other being the year of production.

== Recipes ==
Tea factories, particularly formerly government-owned factories, produce many cakes using recipes for tea blends, indicated by a four-digit &quot;recipe number&quot;. The first two digits of recipe numbers represent the year the recipe was first produced, the third digit represents the grade of leaves used in the recipe, and the last digit represents the factory. The number 7542, for example, would denote a recipe from 19&quot;75&quot; using &quot;fourth&quot;-grade tea leaf made by Menghai Tea Factory (represented by &quot;2&quot;).
* Factory numbers (fourth digit in recipe):
*# Kunming Tea Factory
*# Menghai Tea Factory aka Dayi
*# Xiaguan
*# Lan Cang Tea Factory or Feng Qing Tea Factory
*# Pu-erh Tea Factory (now Pu-erh Tea group Co. Ltd )
*# Six Famous Tea Mountain Factory
*# unknown / not specified
*# Haiwan Tea Factory and Long Sheng Tea Factory
Tea of all shapes can be made by numbered recipe. Not all recipes are numbered, and not all cakes are made by recipe. The term &quot;recipe,&quot; it should be added, does not always indicate consistency, as the quality of some recipes change from year-to-year, as do the contents of the cake. Perhaps only the factories producing the recipes really know what makes them consistent enough to label by these numbers.

Occasionally, a three digit code is attached to the recipe number by hyphenation. The first digit of this code represents the year the cake was produced, and the other two numbers indicate the production number within that year. For instance, the seven digit sequence &quot;8653-602&quot;, would indicate the &quot;second&quot; production in 200&quot;6&quot; of factory recipe 8653. Some productions of cakes are valued over others because production numbers can indicate if a tea was produced earlier or later in a season/year. This information allows one to be able to single out tea cakes produced using a better batch of &quot;máochá&quot;.

== Tea packaging ==
Pu&#x27;er tea is specially packaged for trade, identification, and storage. These attributes are used by tea drinkers and collectors to determine the authenticity of the pu&#x27;er tea.

=== Individual cakes ===

Pu&#x27;er tea cakes, or &quot;bǐngchá&quot; ( or ), are almost always sold with a:
* &quot;Wrapper&quot;: Made usually from thin cotton cloth or cotton paper and shows the tea company/factory, the year of production, the region/mountain of harvest, the plant type, and the recipe number. The wrapper can also contain decals, logos and artwork. Occasionally, more than one wrapper will be used to wrap a pu&#x27;er cake.
* &quot;Nèi fēi&quot; ( or ): A small ticket originally stuck on the tea cake but now usually embedded into the cake during pressing. It is usually used as proof, or a possible sign, to the authenticity of the tea. Some higher end pu&#x27;er cakes have more than one nèi fēi embedded in the cake. The ticket usually indicates the tea factory and brand.
* &quot;Nèi piào&quot; ( ): A larger description ticket or flyer packaged loose under the wrapper. Both aid in assuring the identity of the cake. It usually indicates factory and brand. As well, many &quot;nèi piào&quot; contain a summary of the tea factories&#x27; history and any additional laudatory statements concerning the tea, from its taste and rarity, to its ability to cure diseases and effect weight loss.
* &quot;Bǐng&quot; ( or ): The tea cake itself. Tea cakes or other compressed pu&#x27;er can be made up of two or more grades of tea, typically with higher grade leaves on the outside of the cake and lower grades or broken leaves in the center. This is done to improve the appearance of the tea cake and improve its sale. Predicting the grade of tea used on the inside takes some effort and experience in selection. However, the area in and around the dimple of the tea cake can sometimes reveal the quality of the inner leaves.
Recently, &quot;nèi fēi&quot; have become more important in identifying and preventing counterfeits. Menghai Tea Factory in particular has begun microprinting and embossing their tickets in an effort to curb the growth of counterfeit teas found in the marketplace in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Some &quot;nèi fēi&quot; also include vintage year and are production-specific to help identify the cake and prevent counterfeiting through a surfeit of different brand labels.

Counterfeit pu&#x27;er is common. The practices include claiming the tea is older than it actually is, misidentifying the origin of the leaf as Yunnan instead of a non-Yunnan region, labeling terrace tea as forest tea, and selling green tea instead of raw pu&#x27;er. The interpretation of the packing of pu&#x27;er is usually dependent on the consumer&#x27;s knowledge and negotiation between the consumer and trader.

=== Wholesale ===
When bought in large quantities, pu&#x27;er tea is generally sold in stacks, referred to as a &quot;tǒng&quot; (), which are wrapped in bamboo shoot husks, bamboo stem husks, or coarse paper. Some tongs of vintage pu&#x27;er will contain a &quot;tǒng piào&quot; ( ), or tong ticket, but it is less common to find them in productions past the year 2000. The number of &quot;bǐngchá&quot; in a &quot;tǒng&quot; varies depending on the weight of individual &quot;bǐngchá&quot;. For instance one &quot;tǒng&quot; can contain:
* Seven 357–500 g &#x27;bǐngchá&#x27;,
* Five 250 g mini-&#x27;bǐngchá&#x27;
* Ten 100 g mini-&#x27;bǐngchá&#x27;

Twelve &quot;tǒng&quot; are referred to as being one &quot;jiàn&quot; (), although some producers/factories vary how many &quot;tǒng&quot; equal one &quot;jiàn&quot;. A &quot;jiàn&quot; of tea, which is bound together in a loose bamboo basket, will usually have a large &quot;batch ticket&quot; ( ; pinyin: &quot;dàpiào&quot;) affixed to its side that will indicate information such as the batch number of the tea in a season, the production quantities, tea type, and the factory where it was produced.

== Aging and storage ==
Pu&#x27;er teas of all varieties, shapes, and cultivation can be aged to improve their flavor, but the tea&#x27;s physical properties will affect the speed of aging as well as its quality. These properties include:
* &quot;Leaf quality&quot;: &quot;Maocha&quot; that has been improperly processed will not age to the level of finesse as properly processed &quot;maocha&quot;. The grade and cultivation of the leaf also greatly affect its quality, and thus its aging.
* &quot;Compression&quot;: The tighter a tea is compressed, the slower it will age. In this respect, looser hand- and stone-pressed pu&#x27;er teas will age more quickly than denser hydraulic-pressed pu&#x27;er.
* &quot;Shape and size&quot; : The more surface area, the faster the tea will age. &quot;Bǐngchá&quot; and &quot;zhuancha&quot; thus age more quickly than &quot;golden melon&quot;, &quot;tuocha&quot;, or &quot;jincha&quot;. Larger &quot;bingcha&quot; age slower than smaller &#x27;bǐngchá&#x27;, and so forth.

Just as important as the tea&#x27;s properties, environmental factors for the tea&#x27;s storage also affect how quickly and successfully a tea ages. They include:
* &quot;Air flow&quot;: Regulates the oxygen content surrounding the tea and removes odors from the aging tea. Dank, stagnant air will lead to dank, stale smelling aged tea. Wrapping a tea in plastic will eventually arrest the aging process.
* &quot;Odors&quot;: Tea stored in the presence of strong odors will acquire them, sometimes for the duration of their &quot;lifetime.&quot; Airing out pu&#x27;er teas can reduce these odors, though often not completely.
* &quot;Humidity&quot; : The higher the humidity, the faster the tea will age. Liquid water accumulating on tea may accelerate the aging process but can also cause the growth of mold or make the flavor of the tea less desirable. 60–85% humidity is recommended. There is an ongoing argument as to whether high fluctuations in humidity negatively impact tea quality.
* &quot;Sunlight&quot;: Tea that is exposed to sunlight dries out prematurely, and often becomes bitter.
* &quot;Temperature&quot;: Teas should not be subjected to high heat since undesirable flavors will develop. However at low temperatures, the aging of pu&#x27;er tea will slow down drastically. It is argued whether tea quality is adversely affected if it is subjected to highly fluctuating temperature.

When preserved as part of a &quot;tong&quot;, the material of the &quot;tong&quot; wrapper, whether it is made of bamboo shoot husks, bamboo leaves, or thick paper, can also affect the quality of the aging process. The packaging methods change the environmental factors and may even contribute to the taste of the tea itself.

Age is not the sole factor in determining pu&#x27;er quality. Similar to aging wine, the tea reaches a peak with age and can degrade in quality afterwards. Due to the many recipes and different processing methods used in the production of different batches of pu&#x27;er, the optimal age for each tea will vary. Some may take 10 years while others 20 or 30+ years. It is important to check the status of ageing for your teacakes to know when they have peaked so that proper care can be given to halt the ageing process.

=== Raw pu&#x27;er ===
Over time, raw pu&#x27;er acquires an earthy flavor due to slow oxidation and other, possibly microbial processes. However, this oxidation is not analogous to the oxidation that results in green, oolong, or black tea, because the process is not catalyzed by the plant&#x27;s own enzymes but rather by fungal, bacterial, or autooxidation influences. Pu&#x27;er flavors can change dramatically over the course of the aging process, resulting in a brew tasting strongly earthy but clean and smooth, reminiscent of the smell of rich garden soil or an autumn leaf pile, sometimes with roasted or sweet undertones. Because of its ability to age without losing &quot;quality&quot;, well aged good pu&#x27;er gains value over time in the same way that aged roasted oolong does.

Raw pu&#x27;er can undergo &quot;wet storage&quot; (&quot;shīcāng&quot;, ) and &quot;dry storage&quot; (&quot;gāncāng&quot; ), with teas that have undergone the latter ageing more slowly, but thought to show more complexity. Dry storage involves keeping the tea in &quot;comfortable&quot; temperature and humidity, thus allowing the tea to age slowly. Wet or &quot;humid&quot; storage refers to the storage of pu&#x27;er tea in humid environments, such as those found naturally in Hong Kong, Guangzhou and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan.

The practice of &quot;Pen Shui&quot; involves spraying the tea with water and allowing it dry off in a humid environment. This process speeds up oxidation and microbial conversion, which only loosely mimics the quality of natural dry storage aged pu&#x27;er. &quot;Pen Shui&quot; pu&#x27;er not only does not acquire the nuances of slow aging, it can also be hazardous to drink because of mold, yeast, and bacteria cultures.

Pu&#x27;er properly stored in different environments can develop different tastes at different rates due to environmental differences in ambient humidity, temperature, and odors. For instance, similar batches of pu&#x27;er stored in the different environments of Yunnan, Guangzhou and Hong Kong are known to age very differently. Because the process of aging pu&#x27;er is lengthy, and teas may change owners several times, a batch of pu&#x27;er may undergo different aging conditions, even swapping wet and dry storage conditions, which can drastically alter its flavor. Raw pu&#x27;er can be ruined by storage at very high temperatures, or exposure to direct contact with sunlight, heavy air flow, liquid water, or unpleasant smells.

Although low to moderate air flow is important for producing a good-quality aged raw pu&#x27;er, it is generally agreed by most collectors and connoisseurs that raw pu&#x27;er tea cakes older than 30 years should not be further exposed to &quot;open&quot; air since it would result in the loss of flavors or degradation in mouthfeel. The tea should instead be preserved by wrapping or hermetically sealing it in plastic wrapping or ideally glass.

=== Ripe pu&#x27;er ===
Since the ripening process was developed to imitate aged raw pu&#x27;er, many arguments surround the idea of whether aging ripened pu&#x27;er is desirable. Mostly, the issue rests on whether aging ripened pu&#x27;er will, for better or worse, alter the flavor of the tea.

It is often recommended to age ripened pu&#x27;er to air out the unpleasant musty flavors and odors formed due to maocha fermentation. However, some collectors argue that keeping ripened pu&#x27;er longer than 10 to 15 years makes little sense, stating that the tea will not develop further and possibly lose its desirable flavors. Others note that their experience has taught them that ripened pu&#x27;er indeed does take on nuances through aging, and point to side-by-side taste comparisons of ripened pu&#x27;er of different ages. Aging the tea increases its value, but may be unprofitable.

=== Vintaging ===
The common misconception is that all types of pu&#x27;er tea will improve in taste—and therefore gain in value—as they get older. Many different factors play into what makes a tea ideal for aging and the aging process itself. Further, ripe (shu) pu&#x27;er will not evolve as dramatically as raw (sheng) pu&#x27;er will over time due to secondary oxidation and fermentation.

As with aging wine, only finely made and properly stored teas will improve and increase in value. Similarly, only a small percentage of teas will improve over a long period of time.

From 2008 Pu&#x27;er prices dropped dramatically. Investment-grade Pu&#x27;er did not drop as much as the more common varieties. Many producers made large losses, and some decided to leave the industry altogether.

== Preparation ==
Preparation of &quot;pu&#x27;er&quot; involves first separating a portion of the compressed tea for brewing. This can be done by flaking off pieces of the cake or by steaming the entire cake until it is soft from heat and hydration. A &quot;pu&#x27;erh knife&quot;, which is similar to an oyster knife or a rigid letter opener, is used to pry large horizontal flakes of tea off the cake to minimize leaf breakage. Smaller cakes such as &quot;tuocha&quot; or mushroom &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot; are often steamed until they can be rubbed apart and then dried. In both cases, a vertical sampling of the cake should be obtained since the quality of the leaves in a cake usually varies between the surface and the center.

&quot;Pu&#x27;erh&quot; is commonly brewed in the Gongfu style using &quot;Yixing teaware&quot; or a gaiwan, a Chinese brewing vessel consisting of bowl, lid, and saucer. Optimum water temperatures are generally regarded to be in the range of 85-99 °C depending on the quality and processing of the &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot;. The leaves are traditionally given one or more &quot;rinses&quot; before the first infusion, involving exposing them to hot water for 2–5 seconds and subsequently discarding the extract produced. This is done to saturate the leaf with water and allow it to decompress, as well as remove any small leaf particles that could adversely affect the outcome of the first infusion. The first infusion is steeped for 12 to 30 seconds, followed by later infusions repeatedly increasing by 2–10 seconds. The prolonged steeping sometimes used in the west can produce dark, bitter, and unpleasant brews. Quality aged &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot; can yield many more infusions, with different flavor nuances when brewed in the traditional Gongfu method.

Because of the prolonged fermentation in ripened &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot; and slow oxidization of aged raw &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot;, these teas often lack the bitter, astringent properties of other teas, and can be brewed much stronger and repeatedly, with some claiming 20 or more infusions of tea from one pot of leaves. On the other hand, young raw &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot; is known and expected to be strong and aromatic, yet very bitter and somewhat astringent when brewed, since these characteristics are believed to produce better aged raw &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot;.

=== Judging quality ===
Quality of the tea can be determined through inspecting the dried leaves, the tea liquor, or the spent tea leaves. The &quot;true&quot; quality of a specific batch of &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot; can ultimately only be revealed when the tea is brewed and tasted. Although not concrete and sometimes dependent on preference, there are several general indicators of quality:
* &quot;Dried tea&quot;: There should be a lack of twigs, extraneous matter and white or dark mold spots on the surface of the compressed &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot;. The leaves should ideally be whole, visually distinct, and not appear muddy. The leaves may be dry and fragile, but not powdery. Good tea should be quite fragrant, even when dry. Good pressed pu&#x27;er cakes often have a matte sheen on the surface, though this is not necessarily a sole indicator of quality.
* &quot;Liquor&quot;: The tea liquor of both raw and ripe &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot; should never appear cloudy. Well-aged raw &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot; and well-crafted ripe &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot; tea may produce a dark reddish liquor, reminiscent of a dried jujube, but in either case the liquor should not be opaque, &quot;muddy,&quot; or black in color. The flavors of &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot; liquors should persist and be revealed throughout separate or subsequent infusions, and never abruptly disappear, since this could be the sign of added flavorants.
** &quot;Young raw pu&#x27;erh&quot;: The ideal liquors should be aromatic with a light but distinct odors of camphor, rich herbal notes like Chinese medicine, fragrance floral notes, hints of dried fruit aromas such as preserved plums, and should exhibit only some grassy notes to the likes of fresh sencha. Young raw pu&#x27;er may sometimes be quite bitter and astringent, but should also exhibit a pleasant mouthfeel and &quot;sweet&quot; aftertaste, referred to as &quot;gān&quot; (甘) and &quot;húigān&quot; (回甘).
** &quot;Aged raw pu&#x27;erh&quot;: Aged pu&#x27;er should never smell moldy, musty, or strongly fungal, though some &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot; drinkers consider these smells to be unoffensive or even enjoyable. The smell of aged &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot; may vary, with an &quot;aged&quot; but not &quot;stuffy&quot; odor. The taste of aged raw &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot; or ripe &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot; should be smooth, with slight hints of bitterness, and lack a biting astringency or any off-sour tastes. The element of taste is an important indicator of aged &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot; quality, the texture should be rich and thick and should have very distinct &quot;gān&quot; (甘) and &quot;húigān&quot; (回甘) on the tongue and cheeks, which together induces salivation and leaves a &quot;feeling&quot; in the back of the throat.
* &quot;Spent tea&quot;: Whole leaves and leaf bud stems should be easily seen and picked out of the wet spent tea, with a limited amount of broken fragments. Twigs and the fruits of the tea plant should not be found in the spent tea leaves; however, animal (and human) hair, strings, rice grains and chaff may occasionally be included in the tea. The leaves should not crumble when rubbed, and with ripened &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot;, it should not resemble compost. Aged raw &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot; should have leaves that unfurl when brewed while leaves of most ripened &quot;pu&#x27;erh&quot; will generally remain closed.

=== Practices ===
In Cantonese, the tea is called &quot;po-lay&quot; (). It is often drunk during dim sum meals, as it is believed to help with digestion. It is not uncommon to add dried osmanthus flowers, pomelo rinds, or chrysanthemum flowers into brewing pu&#x27;er tea in order to add a light, fresh fragrance to the tea liquor. Pu&#x27;er with chrysanthemum is the most common pairing, and referred as &quot;guk pou&quot; or &quot;guk bou&quot; ( ; ; pinyin: jú pǔ).

Sometimes wolfberries are brewed with the tea, plumping in the process.

== Chemical constituents == 
Pu&#x27;er tea primarily consisted of amino acids and proteins (L-theanine, phenylalanine, histidine, glutamine), carbohydrates (polysaccharides, soluble sugars), minerals (Fe, Mg, Mn), volatile compounds (ketones, alcohols, hydrocarbons), phenolic compounds [flavonoids (flavan-3-ol, flavonol, flavone, flavanonol), phenolic acids], purine alkaloids (caffeine, theobromine), and phenolic pigments (theabrownin, theaflavin, thearubigin).

== Popular culture ==
In the Japanese manga &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, the name of the character Pu&#x27;ar is a pun on pu&#x27;er tea.

<text>Hofstra University is a private university in Hempstead, New York, United States. It originated in 1935 as an extension of New York University and became an independent college in 1939. Comprising ten schools, including the Zucker School of Medicine and the Maurice A. Deane School of Law, Hofstra has hosted a series of prominent presidential conferences and several United States presidential debates.

==History==
The college was founded in 1935 on the estate of namesake William S. Hofstra (1861–1932), a lumber entrepreneur of Dutch ancestry, and his second wife Kate Mason (1854–1933). It began as an extension of New York University (NYU) under the name Nassau College – Hofstra Memorial of New York University. It became the fourth and most recent U.S. college or university named after a Dutch American, and the only one that occurred in the 20th century.

The extension had been proposed by a Hempstead resident, Truesdel Peck Calkins, who had been superintendent of schools for Hempstead. In her will, Kate Mason provided the bulk of their property and estate to be used for a charitable, scientific or humanitarian purpose, to be named in honor of her husband. In the spring of 1934, the estate was offered to be converted into a sanitarium for those suffering with polio by the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation, specifically offering to President Franklin Roosevelt, but nothing had materialized from it. Two friends, Howard Brower and James Barnard, were asked to decide what to do with the estate. Calkins remarked to Brower that he had been looking for a site to start an institution of higher education, and the three men agreed it would be an appropriate use of the estate. Calkins approached the administration at New York University, and they expressed interest.

The college was founded as a coeducational, commuter institution with day and evening classes. The first day of classes at Nassau-Hofstra Memorial College was September 23, 1935, with 150 students enrolled and an equal divide between men and women. The first class of students was made up of 159 day and 621 evening students. The tuition fee for the year was $375. The college obtained provisional charter status, and its official name was changed to Hofstra College on January 16, 1937.

Hofstra College separated from New York University on July 1, 1939, and was granted an absolute charter on February 16, 1940.

In 1950, Calkins Gymnasium was the site of the first Shakespeare Festival. It was performed on a five-sixths-sized replica of the Globe Theatre. The festival is now performed on the Globe Stage, the most accurate Globe Theatre replica in the United States.

In 1968, a three-bank Aeolian pipe organ was donated to Hofstra by John T. Ricks and Jane Ricks King, in the name of their late parents, Mr. and Mrs. Jesse Ricks. The organ was originally located in the former Ricks estate, Chanticlare, in Flower Hill, New York. Jesse Ricks was the former president and chairman of Union Carbide, and Mrs. Ricks was a volunteer church organist who often held organ performances at the estate for friends on Sundays. The organ was scheduled to be installed in the Hofstra Playhouse the following fall, and enabled organ music majors at Hofstra to practice on-campus - as opposed to at the nearby Episcopal Cathedral of the Incarnation.

Hofstra Stadium served as the site of the first-ever NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship game in 1971.

===Dutch heritage===

The university&#x27;s founder, William S. Hofstra, was proud of his Dutch roots and that is reflected throughout Hofstra University&#x27;s campus. It is one of three major American universities named after Dutch Americans, after Rutgers University for Henry Rutgers and Vanderbilt University for Cornelius Vanderbilt.

Hofstra&#x27;s original logo was a seal created by professor of art Constant van de Wall in 1937. The insignia was derived from the official seal of the reigning house of the Netherlands, the House of Orange-Nassau. Used with the permission of the monarch of the Netherlands, the seal also included the Dutch national motto &quot;Je Maintiendrai&quot;, meaning &quot;I stand steadfast&quot; in French. Hofstra&#x27;s flag is modeled after the Netherlands&#x27; Prince&#x27;s Flag, and its orange,-white-and-blue pattern was altered to feature the school&#x27;s colors of gold and navy blue. In 1939, the Dutch ambassador to the United States left behind a flag of the Netherlands before he returned to his country for World War II, which influenced Hofstra&#x27;s school colors, university seal and coat of arms.

Hofstra also pays homage to its Dutch heritage with a miniature windmill structure near the admissions building and the planting of thousands of tulips in the springtime. In 1985, the commissioner to the Queen of the Netherlands presented the university with the Hofstra University Tulip, a flower hybrid named after the school. It is a focal point of Hofstra&#x27;s annual springtime Dutch Festival.

An on-campus housing complex is known as &quot;the Netherlands&quot; and features residence halls named after cities in the Netherlands, including Delft, Groningen, Hague, Leiden, Rotterdam, Tilburg, Utrecht, Breukelen and Amsterdam.

Hofstra&#x27;s athletic teams were known as the Flying Dutchmen until 2001.

==Campus==
The Arboretum and Bird Sanctuary at Hofstra University has a collection of diverse trees and reflecting its Dutch origin, and displays an array of rare and colorful tulips in the Spring.

The campus has approximately 117 buildings on , and is located in the Uniondale section of Hempstead, a mile east of the town center. The part of the campus located south of Hempstead Turnpike (NY Route 24) and west of California Avenue is located in Hempstead Village. Hofstra also offers an MBA program as well as other classes in New York City from a center in Manhattan. The campus is roughly east of the Borough of Queens in New York City, and the entire New York City skyline is visible from the tenth floor of the Axinn Library.

The campus is located across the street from the &quot;Nassau Hub&quot; and Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, former home of the New York Islanders, Long Island Nets, New York Riptide, and New York Open.

==Academics==
===Rankings and reputation===

Hofstra University is accredited in 28 academic areas and 32 total areas. Hofstra University offers 185 undergraduate and 170 graduate program options.

Hofstra was ranked tied for 160th among national universities and named the 92nd &#x27;best value school&#x27; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; for 2020, with its undergraduate engineering program ranked tied for 33rd among schools where doctorates are not offered. &quot;U.S. News&quot; also rated the part-time MBA program tied for 154th and the graduate programs in education as 133rd, among others.

The Stuart and Nancy Rabinowitz Honors College, whose admissions policy is more selective than that of the university as a whole, 

In the fall of 2011, the university welcomed the first class of students to its new Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine. In 2012, it established its school of engineering and applied science, featuring programs that partner with regional industry leaders, and its school of health sciences and human services, housing a new master of public health program. In August 2017, after a $61 million donation to the school, it was renamed the Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell.

The Zucker School of Medicine was ranked No. 55 in primary care and No. 71 in research, according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, despite it being only being two years since its first class graduated.

In September 2009, Stuart Rabinowitz announced the appointment of two senior presidential fellows at the university&#x27;s Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency: Republican strategist and former presidential advisor Edward J. Rollins and former Vermont governor, presidential candidate and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean. In October 2011, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced it had chosen Hofstra for its second 2012 presidential debate on October 16, 2012, the &quot;town hall&quot; debate (between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney). Hofstra University hosted the first 2016 presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on September 26, 2016.

===Admissions===
Hofstra maintains a test-optional policy for admissions. For the cohort entering in 2023, 35% of enrollees submitted test scores and the average scores for the SAT were 1230-1410 and for the ACT were 27-33. Hofstra admitted 62% of applicants with enrolled students having an average 3.7 GPA.

==Athletics==
Hofstra University teams were nicknamed the Flying Dutchmen from 1935 until 2001. The school&#x27;s official team name became &quot;The Pride&quot; in 2001, referring to a pair of lions which became the school&#x27;s athletic mascots in the late 1980s. The Pride nickname evolved from the Hofstra Pride on- and off-campus image campaign that began in 1987, during the university&#x27;s dramatic recovery and growth. This followed a financial crisis in the 1970s that forced the layoff of more than 100 employees. In 1977 Hofstra wrestler Nick Gallo won the 126 lb weight class at the NCAA National Championship and was a member of the 1976 and 1980 U.S. Olympic Freestyle Wrestling teams, he was also given the title &quot;Most Outstanding Wrestler&quot; in the 1977 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships.

Prior to 2008, the New York Jets held summer training camp at their on-campus headquarters before moving to their new headquarters in Florham Park, New Jersey. The area has since been used for the construction of the medical school building, which was completed in 2015.

On December 3, 2009, the university announced it was terminating the football program. Under NCAA rules, any football players who chose to transfer to other schools were eligible to play immediately, and not subjected to normal residency waiting periods. Scholarship-holders who wished to stay at Hofstra were permitted to keep their scholarships. Funds previously used for the football program went into the creation of the medical school, and enhancing a variety of programs, including hard sciences and engineering.

On February 26, 2011, Hofstra Senior Day, the university retired the basketball jersey number 22 to honor senior Charles Jenkins before the end of the season. Jenkins, the school&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, ranked fifth in the nation at 23.3 points per game last season () and was the front-runner to win Colonial Athletic Association Player of the Year honors. &quot;I think it&#x27;s very rare,&quot; head coach Mo Cassara said by phone to reporter Jeff Eisenberg. &quot;We have 25 other athletes that have had their numbers retired here at Hofstra, but none of them have ever been retired while they were still here at their last games. He&#x27;s been such an integral part of this university on so many levels that we thought that was the highest honor we could give him.&quot; No other Hofstra athlete in any sport has received the same honor.

==Media==
===Student newspaper===
&quot;The Hofstra Chronicle&quot; is the only student newspaper at Hofstra University. Established in 1935 and supported by the student activity fee and advertising, it is published in tabloid format every Tuesday evening each semester, with additional content available online.

===Student radio station===

The university operates Long Island&#x27;s oldest public radio station, WRHU-FM (88.7). The non-commercial station was founded in 1950 as WHCH, a campus-limited station, and received its broadcast license on June 9, 1959, using the call letters WVHC. The station became WRHU (for Radio Hofstra University) in 1983. WRHU currently serves as the radio home of the Long Island Nets and New York Islanders, producing over 675 NHL broadcasts since 2010. It is the only student-run radio station to receive four Marconi Awards from the National Association of Broadcasters.

<text>The National Constitution Center is a non-profit institution that is devoted to the study of the Constitution of the United States. Located at the Independence Mall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the center is an interactive museum which serves as a national town hall, hosting government leaders, journalists, scholars, and celebrities who engage in public discussions, including Constitution-related events and presidential debates.

The groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 17, 2000, the 213th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution. The center opened on July 4, 2003, joining other historic sites and attractions in what has been called &quot;America&#x27;s most historic square mile&quot;, because of its proximity to Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell. The center offers civic learning resources onsite and online. It does not house the original Constitution, which is stored at the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C.

==Background==

The center was created by the Constitution Heritage Act. Approved on September 16, 1988, and signed by President Ronald Reagan, the act defined the National Constitution Center as &quot;within or in close proximity to the Independence National Historical Park. The Center shall disseminate information about the United States Constitution on a non-partisan basis in order to increase the awareness and understanding of the Constitution among the American people.&quot; The center is at 525 Arch Street, an address chosen because May 25 (5/25) was the date that the Constitutional Convention began in Philadelphia.

The architectural firm of Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners designed the center, and Leslie E. Robertson Associates were the structural engineers for the project. Witold Rybczynski of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Quiet but assertive, respectful of its surroundings, considerate of its public, this building is destined to take its place among the nation&#x27;s leading public monuments.&quot;

Ralph Appelbaum Associates designed the center&#x27;s visitor experience and exhibition hall. The public space is , including galleries. The center has of exhibit space. The center is made of American products, including of Indiana limestone, 2.6 million pounds of steel, and a half-million cubic feet of concrete. Construction of the center was overseen by project manager Hill International.

Prior to its closure in December 2019, the Newseum, a journalism-themed museum in Washington D.C., had featured a four-story-tall stone panel inscribed with the text of the First Amendment as part of its exterior design. The Freedom Forum, a nonprofit organization that created the museum, announced in March 2021 that the panel would be dismantled and donated to the National Constitution Center for display in its second-floor atrium.

==Leadership==
The National Constitution Center board of trustees appointed law professor, legal commentator, and former visiting scholar Jeffrey Rosen to serve as president and chief executive officer of the center; Rosen began his tenure in June 2013. The honorary board chairs of the center include:
==Civic education==
Through its Annenberg Center for Education and Outreach, the center offers onsite and online civic-education programs and a study center which develops and distributes teaching tools, lesson plans and resources.

==Public engagement==
The center has hosted several debates, including a 2008 Democratic presidential primary debate between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, a town hall meeting with Senator John McCain, and a 2006 Pennsylvania Senatorial debate between Republican incumbent Rick Santorum and Democratic challenger Bob Casey.

The center hosted the second 2024 Presidential debate on September 10, 2024. It was the first debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, after President Joe Biden exited the race in the weeks following the first debate of the cycle. Ironically, no mention was made of the US Constitution by either candidate during the entire 90 minute debate.

==Liberty Medal==
In 2006, the center became home to the Philadelphia Liberty Medal, an annual award established in 1988 to recognize &quot;men and women of courage and conviction who strive to secure the blessings of liberty to people around the globe.&quot;

==Reception==
George Will wrote for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;At the other end of the mall sparkles a modernist jewel of America&#x27;s civic life, the National Constitution Center&quot;. Jason DeParle wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot; Learning Network, &quot;Since opening in 2003, [the National Constitution Center] has put forward a vision of constitutional history both left and right have embraced.&quot; According to &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, &quot;The National Constitution Center has established itself as one of the city&#x27;s cultural celebs, attracting a million visitors a year, putting pizzazz into civic and educational offerings, hosting blockbuster exhibitions, and attracting the nation&#x27;s intellectual cognoscenti and media elite like bears to honey.&quot;

<doc id="418094" wikidata="Q51002" url="?curid=418094" title="Jerry Rawlings">
<text>Jerry John Rawlings (born Jerry Rawlings John; 22 June 194712 November 2020) was a Ghanaian military officer, aviator and politician who led the country for a brief period in 1979, and then from 1981 to 2001. He led a military junta until 1993, and then served two terms as the democratically elected president of Ghana. He was the longest-serving leader in Ghana&#x27;s history, presiding over the country for 19 years.

Rawlings came to power in Ghana as a flight lieutenant of the Ghana Air Force following a bloody coup d&#x27;état in 1979. Prior to that, he led an unsuccessful coup attempt against the ruling military government on Tuesday, 15 May 1979, just five weeks before scheduled democratic elections were due to take place. After handing power over to a civilian government, he overthrew the democratically elected Government through a military coup on Thursday, 31 December 1981 as the chairman of the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC). Under his military regime there were numerous human rights abuses.

In 1992, Rawlings resigned from the military, founded the National Democratic Congress (NDC), and became the first president of the Fourth Republic. Rawlings brokered a ceasefire in 1995 during the First Liberian Civil War. He was re-elected in 1996 for four more years. After two terms in office, the limit according to the Ghanaian Constitution, Rawlings endorsed his vice-president John Atta Mills as a presidential candidate in 2000. Rawlings served as the African Union envoy to Somalia. He died in 2020 at age 73 and was accorded a state funeral.

== Background ==
Rawlings was born as Jerry Rawlings John on Sunday, 22 June 1947 in Accra, Ghana, to Victoria Agbotui, an Anlo Ewe from Dzelukope, Keta, and James Ramsey John, a British chemist from Castle Douglas in Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland. His father never lived with him and his mother and went back to Britain in 1959. Rawlings attended Achimota School and a military academy at Teshie. Rawlings was married to Nana Konadu Agyeman, whom he met while at Achimota College. They had three daughters: Zanetor Rawlings, Yaa Asantewaa Rawlings, Amina Rawlings; and one son, Kimathi Rawlings. Junior Agogo was the nephew of Rawlings.

=== Education and military career ===
Rawlings finished his secondary education at Achimota College in 1967. He joined the Ghana Air Force shortly afterwards; on his application, the military switched his surname John and his middle name Rawlings. In March 1968, he was posted to Takoradi, in Ghana&#x27;s Western Region, to continue his studies. He graduated in January 1969, and was commissioned as a pilot officer, winning the coveted &quot;Speed Bird Trophy&quot; as the best cadet in flying the Su-7 ground attack supersonic jet aircraft as he was skilled in aerobatics. He earned the rank of flight lieutenant in April 1978. During his service with the Ghana Air Force, Rawlings perceived a deterioration in discipline and morale due to corruption in the Supreme Military Council (SMC). As promotion brought him into contact with the privileged classes and their social values, his view of the injustices in society hardened. He was thus regarded with some unease by the SMC. After the 1979 coup, he involved himself with the student community of the University of Ghana, where he developed a more leftist ideology through reading and discussion of social and political ideas.

== 1979 coup and purges ==

Rawlings grew discontented with Ignatius Kutu Acheampong&#x27;s government, which had come to power through a coup in January 1972. Acheampong was accused not only of corruption, but also of maintaining Ghana&#x27;s dependency on pre-colonial powers, in a situation which led to economic decline and impoverishment.

Rawlings was part of the Free Africa Movement, an underground movement of military officers who wanted to unify Africa through a series of coups. On Tuesday, 15 May 1979, five weeks prior to civilian elections, Rawlings and six other soldiers staged a coup against the government of General Fred Akuffo, but failed and were arrested by the military. Rawlings was publicly sentenced to death in a General Court Martial and imprisoned, although his statements on the social injustices that motivated his actions won him civilian sympathy. While awaiting execution, Rawlings was sprung from custody on Monday, 4 June 1979 by a group of soldiers. Claiming that the government was corrupt beyond redemption and that new leadership was required for Ghana&#x27;s development, he led the group in a coup to oust the Akuffo Government and Supreme Military Council. Shortly afterwards, Rawlings established and became the Chairman of a 15-member Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), primarily composed of junior officers. He and the AFRC ruled for 112 days and arranged the execution by firing squad of eight military officers, including Generals Kotei, Joy Amedume, Roger Felli, and Utuka, as well as the three former Ghanaian heads of state; Acheampong, Akuffo, and Akwasi Afrifa.

These executions were dramatic events in the history of Ghana, which had previously suffered few instances of political violence. Rawlings later implemented a much wider &quot;house-cleaning exercise&quot; involving the killings and abduction of over 300 Ghanaians. Elections were held on time shortly after the coup. On Monday, 24 September 1979, power was peacefully handed over by Rawlings to President Hilla Limann, whose People&#x27;s National Party (PNP) had the support of Nkrumah&#x27;s followers. Two years later, on 31 December 1981 Rawlings ousted President Hilla Limann in a coup d&#x27;état, claiming that civilian rule was weak and the country&#x27;s economy was deteriorating. The killings of the Supreme Court justices (Cecilia Koranteng-Addow, Frederick Sarkodie, and Kwadjo Agyei Agyepong), military officers Major Sam Acquah and Major Dasana Nantogmah also occurred during the second military rule of Rawlings. However, unlike the 1979 executions, these persons were abducted and killed in secret and it is unclear who was behind their murders, though Joachim Amartey Kwei and four others were convicted of murdering the Justices and Acquah, and were executed in 1982.

== 1981 coup and reforms ==

Believing the Limann administration to be unable to resolve Ghana&#x27;s neocolonial economic dependency, Rawlings led a second coup against Limann and indicted the entire political class on 31 December 1981. In place of Limann&#x27;s People&#x27;s National Party, Rawlings established the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) military junta as the official government.

Rawlings hosted state visits from &quot;revolutionaries&quot; from other countries, including Dési Bouterse (Suriname), Daniel Ortega (Nicaragua), and Sam Nujoma (Namibia). More famously, Rawlings reversed Limann&#x27;s boycott of Gaddafi&#x27;s Libya, allowing the Black Stars to compete in the 1982 African Cup of Nations. The team won the AFCON trophy for the fourth time, their last win as of 2022.

Although the PNDC claimed to be representative of the people, it lacked experience in the creation and implementation of clear economic policies. Rawlings, like many of his predecessors, attributed current economic and social problems to the &quot;trade malpractices and other anti-social activities&quot; of a few businesspeople. In December 1982, the PNDC announced its four-year economic program of establishing a state monopoly on export-import trade with the goal of eliminating corruption surrounding import licences and shift trade away from dependency on Western markets. Unrealistic price controls were imposed on the market and enforced through coercive acts, especially against businesspeople. This resolve to employ state control over the economy is best demonstrated by the destruction of the Makola No.1 Market. The PNDC established Workers&#x27; Defence Committees (WDCs) and People&#x27;s Defence Committees (PDCs) to mobilize the population to support radical changes to the economy. Price controls on the sale of food were beneficial to urban workers, but placed undue burden on 70% of the rural population whose income largely depended on the prices of agricultural products. Rawlings&#x27; economic policies led to an economic crisis in 1983, forcing him to undertake structural adjustment and submit himself to election to retain power. Elections were held in January 1992, leading Ghana back to multiparty democracy.

== 1992 elections ==
Rawlings established the National Commission on Democracy (NCD) shortly after the 1982 coup, and employed it to survey civilian opinion and make recommendations that would facilitate the process of democratic transition. In March 1991, the NCD released a report recommending the election of an executive president, the establishment of a national assembly, and the creation of the post of prime minister. The PNDC used NCD recommendations to establish a committee for the drafting of a new constitution based on past Ghanaian Constitutions, that lifted the ban on political parties in May 1992 after it was approved by referendum.

On Friday, 3 November 1992, election results compiled by the INEC from 200 constituencies showed that Rawlings&#x27; NDC had won 60% of the votes, and had obtained the majority needed to prevent a second round of voting. More specifically, the NDC won 62% in the Brong-Ahafo region, 93% in the Volta region, and majority votes in Upper West, Upper East, Western, Northern, Central, and Greater Accra regions. His opponents Professor Adu Boahen won 31% of the votes, former President Hilla Limann won 6.8%, Kwabena Darko won 2.9%, and Emmanuel Erskine won 1.7%. Voter turnout was 50%.

The ability of opposition parties to compete was limited by the vast advantages Rawlings possessed. Rawlings&#x27; victory was aided by the various party structures that were integrated into society during his rule, called the &quot;organs of the revolution&quot;. These structures included the Committees for the Defence of the Revolution (CDRs), Commando Units, 31 December Women&#x27;s Organization, the 4 June movement, Peoples Militias, and Mobisquads, and operated on a system of popular control through intimidation. Rawlings held a monopoly over national media, and was able to censor print and electronic media through a PNDC newspaper licensing decree, PNDC Law 221. Moreover, Rawlings imposed a 20,000 Cedis (about $400) cap on campaign contributions, which made national publicity of opposition parties virtually impossible. Rawlings himself began campaigning before the official unbanning of political parties and had access to state resources and was able to effectively meet all monetary demands required of a successful campaign. Rawlings travelled across the country, initiating public-works projects and giving public employees a 60% pay rise prior to election day.

Opposition parties objected to the election results, citing incidences of vote stuffing in regions where Rawlings was likely to lose and rural areas with scant populations, as well as a bloated voters&#x27; register and a partisan electoral commission. However, the Commonwealth Observer Group, led by Sir Ellis Clarke, approved of the election as &quot;free and fair&quot;, as there were very few issues at polling stations and no major incidences of voter coercion. In contrast, the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) issued a report supporting claims that erroneous entries in voter registration could have affected election results. The Carter Center did acknowledge minor electoral issues but did not see these problems as indicative of systematic electoral fraud.

Opposition parties boycotted subsequent Ghana parliamentary and presidential elections, and the unicameral National Assembly, of which NDC officials won 189 of 200 seats and essentially established a one-party parliament that lacked legitimacy and only had limited legislative powers. After the disputed election, the PNDC was transformed into the National Democratic Congress (NDC).

Rawlings took office on Thursday, 7 January 1993, the same day that the new constitution came into effect, and the government became known as the Fourth Republic of Ghana.

== Policies and reforms ==
Rawlings established the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) suggested by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in 1982 due to the poor state of the economy after 18 months of attempting to govern it through administrative controls and mass mobilization. The policies implemented caused a dramatic currency devaluation, the removal of price controls, and social-service subsidies which favored farmers over urban workers, and privatization of some state-owned enterprises, and restraints on government spending. Funding was provided by bilateral donors, reaching US$800 million in 1987 and 1988, and US$900 million in 1989.

Between 1992 and 1996, Rawlings eased control over the judiciary and civil society, allowing a more independent Supreme Court and the publication of independent newspapers. Opposition parties operated outside of parliament and held rallies and press conferences.

== 1996 elections ==
Given the various issues with the 1992 elections, the 1996 elections were a great improvement in terms of electoral oversight. Voter registration was re-compiled, with close to 9.2 million voters registering at nearly 19,000 polling stations, which the opposition had largely approved after party agents had reviewed the lists. The emphasis on transparency led Ghanaian non-governmental organizations to create the Network of Domestic Election Observers (NEDEO), which trained nearly 4,100 local poll watchers. This organization was popular across political parties and civic groups. On the day of the election, more than 60,000 candidate agents monitored close to all polling sites, and were responsible for directly reporting results to their respective party leaders. The parallel vote-tabulation system allowed polling sites to compare their results to the official ones released by the Electoral commission. The Inter-Party Advisory Committee (IPAC) was established to discuss election preparations with all parties and the Electoral Commission, as well as establish procedures to investigate and resolve complaints. Presidential and parliamentary elections were held on the same day and see-through boxes were used in order to further ensure the legitimacy of the elections. Despite some fears of electoral violence, the election was peaceful and had a 78% turnout rate, and was successful with only minor problems such as an inadequate supply of ink and parliamentary ballots.

The two major contenders of the 1996 election were Rawlings&#x27; NDC, and John Kufuor&#x27;s Great Alliance, an amalgamation of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the People&#x27;s Convention Party (PCP). The Great Alliance based their platform on ousting Rawlings, and attacked the incumbent government for its poor fiscal policies. However, they were unable to articulate a clear positive message of their own, or plans to change the current economic policy. As Ghana was heavily dependent on international aid, local leaders had minimal impact on the economy. The Electoral Commission reported that Rawlings had won by 57%, with Kufuor obtaining 40% of the vote. Results by district were similar to those in 1992, with the opposition winning the Ashanti Region and some constituencies in Eastern and Greater Accra, and Rawlings winning in his ethnic home, the Volta Region, and faring well in every other region. The NDC took 134 seats in the Assembly compared to the opposition&#x27;s 66, and the NPP took 60 seats in the parliament.

== Post-military ==
The 1992 constitution limits a president to two terms, even if they are nonconsecutive. Rawlings did not attempt to amend the document to allow him to run for a third term in 2000. He retired in 2001 and was succeeded by John Kufuor, his main rival and opponent in 1996. It was the first time in Ghanaian history that a sitting government peacefully transferred power to an elected member of the opposition.

Kufuor won the presidency after defeating Rawlings&#x27; vice-president John Atta Mills in a runoff in 2000. In 2004, Mills conceded to Kufuor after another election between the two.

== Post-presidency ==
In November 2000, Rawlings was named the first International Year of Volunteers 2001 Eminent Person by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, attending various events and conferences to promote volunteerism.

In October 2010, Rawlings was named as the African Union envoy to Somalia. In November 2010, he attended the inauguration of Dési Bouterse as President of Suriname, and took a tour of the country. He was especially interested in the Ghanaian origins of the Maroon people.

Rawlings delivered lectures at universities, including Oxford University in England. Rawlings continued his heavy support for NDC. In July 2019, he went on a three-day working trip to Burkina Faso in the capacity of Chairman of the Thomas Sankara Memorial Committee.

In September 2019, he led the Ghanaian governmental delegation to the funeral of Robert Mugabe, the late former president of Zimbabwe.

== Death and state funeral ==
Rawlings died on 12 November 2020 at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, a week after having been admitted for a &quot;short term illness&quot;. According to some reports, his death was caused by complications from COVID-19. His death came nearly two months after that of his mother, Victoria Agbotui, on 24 September 2020. President Nana Akufo-Addo declared a seven-day period of mourning in his honor and flags flown at half-mast. His family members appealed to the Government of Ghana to bury him in Keta in the Volta Region. A schedule for the signing of a book of condolence was opened in his memory. His funeral, originally planned for 23 December 2020, was postponed at the request of his family.

=== State burial ===
From 24 to 27 January 2021, funeral ceremonies were organised at Accra in Rawlings&#x27; memory. A requiem mass for Jerry Rawlings was held at the Holy Spirit Cathedral on 24 January 2021, followed by a vigil at the Air Force Officers&#x27; Mess in Accra later that evening. His body was laid in state in the foyer of the Accra International Conference Centre from 25 to 26 January 2021. There were also traditional rites performed by the Anlo Ewe people of his maternal ancestry. On 27 January 2021, a state funeral, attended by national and international political leaders, paramount chiefs, diplomats and other dignitaries, was held at the Black Star Square before his burial service at the Military Cemetery at Burma Camp, with full military honours, including a slow march by the funeral cortège, a flypast of a Ghana Air Force helicopter, the sounding of the Last Post by army buglers and a 21-gun salute.

<text>Thomas Timothy Holden (born March 5, 1957) is an American politician from Pennsylvania who served as a Democratic U.S. representative for from 1993 to 2013. Holden was the of the Pennsylvania Congressional Delegation during the 112th United States Congress. On April 24, 2012, Holden was defeated in the Democratic primary in his attempt to seek re-election after the boundaries of his district were redrawn. He is now chairman of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Holden is a lifelong resident of St. Clair, Pennsylvania. He graduated from St. Clair Area High School in 1975. In 1980, he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology from Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania. He became a licensed real estate agent, and later an insurance broker in 1983. He has worked as a probation officer and as Sergeant-at-Arms for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, and was the sheriff of Schuylkill County from 1985 to 1993. He identified with many ordinary working people in his district. He is a Roman Catholic.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In the 1990s, he represented Pennsylvania&#x27;s 6th congressional district based in Reading and including Berks and Schuylkill counties. The district was populated mostly by Reagan Democrats who were still willing to vote Republican in most elections (it voted for George H. W. Bush in 1992, Bob Dole in 1996 and George W. Bush in 2000), but Holden was re-elected four times without serious opposition.

;1992

After redistricting, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Gus Yatron decided to retire. In the Democratic primary, Holden defeated the Mayor of Reading, Pennsylvania, Warren Haggerty, and John Reusing 39%-32%-28%. In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee John E. Jones III, a local government solicitor, 52%-48%.

;1994
Holden won re-election to a second term by defeating Republican nominee Fred Levering 57%-43%.

;1996
Holden won re-election to a third term by defeating Republican nominee Christian Leinbach, a staffer to U.S. Senator Rick Santorum, 59%-41%.

;1998
Holden won re-election to a fourth term by defeating Republican nominee John Meckley 61%-39%.

;2000
Holden won re-election to a fifth term by defeating Republican nominee Thomas Kopel 66%-34%.

;2002

Pennsylvania lost two districts after the 2000 United States Census. The Republican-controlled General Assembly dismantled the 6th, splitting its territory among three other districts. The legislature considered placing Holden&#x27;s home in Schuylkill County in the 11th District, a heavily Democratic area in northeastern Pennsylvania. This would have forced a primary matchup with Paul Kanjorski, an eight-term Democrat who was slightly more liberal than Holden. Eventually, it moved the largest slice of Holden&#x27;s old district, including his home, to the Republican-leaning Harrisburg-based 17th District, represented by 10-term Republican George Gekas.

On paper, the redrawn 17th appeared to so heavily favor Gekas that it appeared unwinnable for a Democrat, even one as conservative as Holden. To some, it was blatant gerrymandering to force Holden into retirement. Gekas retained 60% of his former territory, and George W. Bush had carried the newly drawn district with 57% of the vote in 2000. However, to the surprise of many observers, Holden did not retire, instead opting to run in a district that was 65% new to him (a small corner from the even more Republican 9th District was moved to the 17th). Gekas was forced into his first real campaign ever. Holden managed to gain endorsements from much of Gekas&#x27;s old base, much to Gekas&#x27;s surprise. Even Gekas&#x27;s hometown paper, &quot;The Patriot-News&quot;, endorsed Holden, saying that the 17th was not the same district that elected Gekas in 1982. Gekas got another rude surprise when Holden visited African-American neighborhoods, such as Uptown and Allison Hill, after finding out that Gekas had never set foot in these neighborhoods in his congressional career. He asked the residents of these neighborhoods not to vote for a congressman who didn&#x27;t bother to visit them. In November 2002, in one of the biggest upsets in recent political history, Holden narrowly defeated Gekas.

;2004
Holden ran for re-election against Republican lawyer Scott Paterno, son of legendary Penn State football coach Joe Paterno. Paterno was actively supported by influential Republicans, and President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney came to the district several times to support him. Nevertheless, Holden won re-election by a comfortable margin even as Bush easily carried the district. In much of the district, he was the only elected Democrat above the county level.

;2006

Holden faced Republican Matthew Wertz, an Afghanistan War veteran, in the 2006. However, Wertz dropped out of the race before the general election citing personal reasons and Holden went on to easily win re-election with 65% of the total vote.

;2008

In 2008, he faced Republican Toni Gilhooley, a retired Pennsylvania State Trooper and 25-year veteran of the force, whom he defeated with 64% of the vote (one percent less than the previous election).

;2010

Holden was challenged by Republican nominee, State Senator Dave Argall, whose state senate district covered much of the eastern portion of the congressional district, including Holden&#x27;s home. Unlike other Democrats in Eastern Pennsylvania like Paul Kanjorski, Chris Carney and Patrick Murphy, Holden won re-election, and did so with a 12-point margin, defeating Argall 56% to 44%.

Before Holden won the general election, he faced a primary challenge within his own party from political activist Sheila Dow Ford, who ran to the left of Holden, eviscerating the Congressman for voting against the Affordable Care Act in March 2010. Holden defeated Ford by a margin of 65% to 35% in the primary to regain the Democratic nomination.

;2012

Holden&#x27;s district was drastically reconfigured as a result of legislative redistricting done in the Pennsylvania legislature in late 2011 following the results of the 2010 Census. The district lost Harrisburg and Lebanon, along with its shares of portions of Berks, Dauphin, Lebanon and Perry counties. To make up for the loss in population, the legislature pushed the district well to the north and east, adding Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Pittston, and Easton, among other various towns in Luzerne, Lackawanna, Carbon, Monroe and Northampton counties. Holden now found himself running in territory that he did not know and that did not know him. The only county retained from his old district was his home county, Schuylkill County. As a result of these changes, the 17th was now considerably more Democratic than its predecessor, nearing 60 percent Democratic registration and leaving Holden vulnerable to a challenge to his left in the Democratic primary. Also, the League of Conservation Voters put Tim Holden on their &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; list, targeting him for supporting then-President George W. Bush&#x27;s energy policy, favoring oil production, and opposing President Obama&#x27;s policies including development of clean energy.

In the April 24 primary, Holden was defeated by Moosic attorney Matt Cartwright, a considerably more liberal Democrat. Holden&#x27;s opposition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and climate-change legislation are believed to have contributed to his defeat. He also could not overcome the demographics of the redrawn district, which was almost 80 percent new to him.

===Tenure===
Holden was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition. He was a somewhat conservative Democrat who often bucked his party&#x27;s voting trend, especially on social issues. For instance, he opposed abortion and gun control. However, he supported Democratic priorities on a number of issues. While Holden voted with a minority of House Democrats in favor of the authorization for the use of U.S. force in Iraq in October 2002 for President George W. Bush, he strongly opposed Bush&#x27;s &quot;surge&quot; policy in January 2007. While Holden voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the signature legislative domestic policy achievement of President Barack Obama, in March 2010, he did vote for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, signed into law by Obama, in February 2009. While Holden voted for legislation supported by President Bush that toughened bankruptcy laws and enacted the Halliburton loophole, he voted for the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law by President Obama, in July 2010. According to opencongreess.com, Holden has voted with the Democratic leadership in Congress 73 percent of the time in recent years. He is ranked as one of the top fifteen most conservative Democrats in the House by the &quot;National Journal&quot;.

<doc id="418100" wikidata="Q4649175" url="?curid=418100" title="A36 road">
<text>The A36 is a trunk road and primary route in southwest England that links the port city of Southampton to the city of Bath. At Bath, the A36 connects with the A4 to Bristol, thus providing a road link between the major ports of Southampton and Bristol. It also provides a link between Bristol and London via the A303.

== Route ==
Originally, the A36 continued to Avonmouth, beyond Bristol, but this section was renumbered to the A4.

Within Bath the A36 acts as a ring road on the southern side of the river, from the junction with the A4 at Newbridge to the west of the city. From here traffic can continue to Bristol on the A4 or to Wells and Weston-super-Mare via the A39 and A368 roads. Another link to the A4 on the eastern side at Cleveland Bridge, which provides a route to the M4 motorway via the A46, is highly congested. Plans for a direct link road connecting the A36 with the A46 have been under consideration for a number of years. 

The A36 leaves Bath in an easterly direction towards Bathampton, then turns south to follow the Avon through its steep-sided valley, climbing out of the valley beyond Limpley Stoke. The road passes near a number of towns and a city, including Frome, Warminster, Wilton and Salisbury in Wiltshire, and Totton in Hampshire, on the western outskirts of Southampton, where it meets the M27 motorway and the A35.

==Standard of route==
The majority of the A36 is built to single carriageway standard, but parts of it have been upgraded to dual carriageway. The A36 is dual carriageway for its 1 mile (1.6 km) bypass of the village of Beckington, 3 miles (5 km), briefly combined with the A361 north of Frome. It shares part of Warminster bypass with the A350. It is also dualled for approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) near its grade separated junction with the A303 road, 8 miles (13 km) north-west of Wilton.

The A36 in Salisbury acts as the city&#x27;s ring road, bypassing the city centre to dual carriageway standard. Just south-east of Salisbury the largest dualled section runs for about 4 miles (6 km), bypassing the village of Alderbury. Then, the road is briefly dualled from its roundabout with the A3090 to the M27 motorway (junction 2) – this part of the road is erroneously thought by some to have been previously known as the A36(M); prior to the opening of the Totton Western Bypass on the other side of the junction, it was named as a spur of the M27, and hence is built to motorway standards. The A36 reverts to single carriageway standard through Totton until it terminates.

<doc id="418101" wikidata="Q840400" url="?curid=418101" title="Evolutionary biology">
<text>Evolutionary biology is the subfield of biology that studies the evolutionary processes such as natural selection, common descent, and speciation that produced the diversity of life on Earth. In the 1930s, the discipline of evolutionary biology emerged through what Julian Huxley called the modern synthesis of understanding, from previously unrelated fields of biological research, such as genetics and ecology, systematics, and paleontology.

The investigational range of current research has widened to encompass the genetic architecture of adaptation, molecular evolution, and the different forces that contribute to evolution, such as sexual selection, genetic drift, and biogeography. The newer field of evolutionary developmental biology (&quot;evo-devo&quot;) investigates how embryogenesis is controlled, thus yielding a wider synthesis that integrates developmental biology with the fields of study covered by the earlier evolutionary synthesis.

== Subfields ==

Evolution is the central unifying concept in biology. Biology can be divided into various ways. One way is by the level of biological organization, from molecular to cell, organism to population. Another way is by perceived taxonomic group, with fields such as zoology, botany, and microbiology, reflecting what was once seen as the major divisions of life. A third way is by approaches, such as field biology, theoretical biology, experimental evolution, and paleontology. These alternative ways of dividing up the subject have been combined with evolutionary biology to create subfields like evolutionary ecology and evolutionary developmental biology.

More recently, the merge between biological science and applied sciences gave birth to new fields that are extensions of evolutionary biology, including evolutionary robotics, engineering, algorithms, economics, and architecture. The basic mechanisms of evolution are applied directly or indirectly to come up with novel designs or solve problems that are difficult to solve otherwise. The research generated in these applied fields, contribute towards progress, especially from work on evolution in computer science and engineering fields such as mechanical engineering.

In evolutionary developmental biology, scientists look at how the different processes in development play a role in how a specific organism reaches its current body plan. The genetic regulation of ontogeny and the phylogenetic process is what allows for this kind of understanding of biology. By looking at different processes during development, and going through the evolutionary tree, one can determine at which point a specific structure came about.

== History ==

The idea of evolution by natural selection was proposed by Charles Darwin in 1859, but evolutionary biology, as an academic discipline in its own right, emerged during the period of the modern synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s. It was not until the 1980s that many universities had departments of evolutionary biology. 

Microbiology too is becoming an evolutionary discipline now that microbial physiology and genomics are better understood. The quick generation time of bacteria and viruses such as bacteriophages makes it possible to explore evolutionary questions.

Many biologists have contributed to shaping the modern discipline of evolutionary biology. Theodosius Dobzhansky and E. B. Ford established an empirical research programme. Ronald Fisher, Sewall Wright, and J. B. S. Haldane created a sound theoretical framework. Ernst Mayr in systematics, George Gaylord Simpson in paleontology and G. Ledyard Stebbins in botany helped to form the modern synthesis. James Crow, Richard Lewontin, Dan Hartl, Marcus Feldman, and Brian Charlesworth trained a generation of evolutionary biologists.

== Research topics ==

Research in evolutionary biology covers many topics and incorporates ideas from diverse areas, such as molecular genetics and mathematical and theoretical biology. Some fields of evolutionary research try to explain phenomena that were poorly accounted for in the modern evolutionary synthesis. These include speciation, the evolution of sexual reproduction, the evolution of cooperation, the evolution of ageing, and evolvability.

Some evolutionary biologists ask the most straightforward evolutionary question: &quot;what happened and when?&quot;. This includes fields such as paleobiology, where paleobiologists and evolutionary biologists, including Thomas Halliday and Anjali Goswami, studied the evolution of early mammals going far back in time during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras (between 299 million to 12,000 years ago). Other fields related to generic exploration of evolution (&quot;what happened and when?&quot; ) include systematics and phylogenetics.

The modern evolutionary synthesis was devised at a time when the molecular basis of genes was unknown. Today, evolutionary biologists try to determine the genetic architecture underlying visible evolutionary phenomena such as adaptation and speciation. They seek answers to questions such as which genes are involved, how interdependent are the effects of different genes, what do the genes do, and what changes happen to them (e.g., point mutations vs. gene duplication or even genome duplication). They try to reconcile the high heritability seen in twin studies with the difficulty in finding which genes are responsible for this heritability using genome-wide association studies. The modern evolutionary synthesis involved agreement about which forces contribute to evolution, but not about their relative importance.

==Journals==
Some scientific journals specialise exclusively in evolutionary biology as a whole, including the journals &quot;Evolution&quot;, &quot;Journal of Evolutionary Biology&quot;, and &quot;BMC Evolutionary Biology&quot;. Some journals cover sub-specialties within evolutionary biology, such as the journals &quot;Systematic Biology&quot;, &quot;Molecular Biology and Evolution&quot; and its sister journal &quot;Genome Biology and Evolution&quot;, and &quot;Cladistics&quot;.

Other journals combine aspects of evolutionary biology with other related fields. For example, &quot;Molecular Ecology&quot;, &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B&quot;, &quot;The American Naturalist&quot; and &quot;Theoretical Population Biology&quot; have overlap with ecology and other aspects of organismal biology. Overlap with ecology is also prominent in the review journals &quot;Trends in Ecology and Evolution&quot; and &quot;Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics&quot;. The journals &quot;Genetics&quot; and &quot;PLoS Genetics&quot; overlap with molecular genetics questions that are not obviously evolutionary in nature.

He has played Nick Harper in &quot;My Family&quot;, Colin Frissell in the 2003 film &quot;Love Actually&quot;, Gratiano in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, and &quot;Murder City&quot; (2006–2008), and Dave in the first series of &quot;Citizen Khan&quot; (2012). He played DI Humphrey Goodman in &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; from 2014 to 2017 and reprised the role in &quot;Beyond Paradise&quot; in 2023.

==Early life and education ==
Kristopher Marshall was born in 1973 in Bath, Somerset. His father was a Royal Air Force (RAF) navigator, whose career included a posting to the Queen&#x27;s Flight, eventually becoming a squadron leader. His parents separated when he was 14. 

Marshall moved with his family to Hong Kong and later to Canada. Upon their return to England, UK, he was educated at Wells Cathedral School as a boarding pupil. After failing his initial A-levels in his first year of sixth form, he enrolled at the Redroofs Theatre School in Maidenhead, Berkshire.

==Career==
Marshall made an early career appearance on the police series &quot;The Bill&quot; but it was in 2000 that his major breakthrough role came as Nick Harper in the BBC sitcom &quot;My Family&quot;. In 2003, he appeared in the film &quot;Love Actually&quot; as Colin Frissell, an Englishman who goes to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the US to find love. 

In 2004, Marshall appeared as DS Luke Stone in the police drama series &quot;Murder City&quot;. From 2005 to 2011, Marshall appeared on TV and in print for BT Retail adverts, where he played the character Adam; with Esther Hall portraying his character&#x27;s eventual wife Jane. He also played The Ginger Dave in the BBC comedy series &quot;Citizen Khan&quot; in 2012 but left after season 1.

Since departing his full-time role in &quot;My Family&quot; in 2003, Marshall made guest appearances three times appearing in 2 episodes of season five in 2004 and his final appearance in a short &quot;Comic Relief&quot; special in 2005. He finished working on the film &quot;Heist&quot; at the end of 2006, which aired in April 2008 on BBC Four. During the summer of 2008, Marshall appeared at Trafalgar Studios in the first UK run of Neil LaBute&#x27;s play &quot;Fat Pig&quot;. He became a regular cast-member, playing the character of Ethan on the series &quot;Traffic Light&quot; in 2011.

In April 2013, it was announced that Marshall would be joining the cast of BBC drama &quot;Death In Paradise&quot; as the island&#x27;s new lead detective, DI Humphrey Goodman. His character was introduced in the first episode of the third series which aired in 2014, with his first case being to solve the murder of his predecessor, DI Richard Poole (played by Ben Miller). In January 2017 it was leaked that Marshall would be leaving the series citing the pressures it placed upon his family and that he would be replaced by Ardal O&#x27;Hanlon who plays DI Jack Mooney.

Marshall starred as Tom Sanger in the 2015 independent British romantic comedy &quot;Sparks &amp; Embers&quot;.

Marshall reprised the role of DI Humphrey Goodman from &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; in a BBC spin-off &quot;Beyond Paradise&quot;, set in South Devon, which aired in February 2023.

Marshall was hit by a car in Bristol in 2008. The crash happened in the early hours of 28 April as he enjoyed a night out with friends in Bristol city centre. He was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary, where a scan revealed head injuries. He made a full recovery and began his performances in the play &quot;Fat Pig&quot; three weeks later as scheduled. Marshall passionately supports Aston Villa and said that a card from the club helped him through his recovery.

In October 2011, Marshall was charged with failing to provide a breath test after police stopped his car in the Tesco car park in Wells, Somerset.

Marshall married Hannah when he was 39. As of December 2014 they were living in Bath and had a two-year-old son. He was still resident there in December 2019.

<text>The United States Army Rangers are elite U.S. Army personnel who have served in any unit which has held the official designation of &quot;Ranger&quot;. The term is commonly used to include graduates of the Ranger School, even if they have never served in a &quot;Ranger&quot; unit; the vast majority of Ranger school graduates never serve in Ranger units and are considered &quot;Ranger qualified&quot;.

In a broader and less formal sense, the term &quot;ranger&quot; has been used, officially and unofficially, in North America since the 17th century, to describe specialized light infantry in small, independent units—usually companies. The first units to be officially designated Rangers were companies recruited in the New England Colonies to fight against Native Americans in King Philip&#x27;s War. Following that time, the term became more common in official usage, during the French and Indian Wars of the 18th century. The U.S. military has had &quot;Ranger&quot; companies since the American Revolutionary War. British Army units designated as &quot;Rangers&quot; have often also had historical links of some kind to British North America.

The 75th Ranger Regiment is an elite airborne light infantry combat formation within the United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC). The six battalions of the modern Rangers have been deployed in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Afghanistan and Iraq. The Ranger Regiment traces its lineage to three of six battalions raised in World War II, and to the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional)—known as &quot;Merrill&#x27;s Marauders&quot;, and then reflagged as the 475th Infantry, then later as the 75th Infantry.

The Ranger Training Brigade (RTB)—headquartered at Fort Moore—is an organization under the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) and is separate from the 75th Ranger Regiment. It has been in service in various forms since World War II. The Ranger Training Brigade administers Ranger School, the satisfactory completion of which is required to become Ranger qualified and to wear the Ranger Tab.

==History==

===Colonial period===
Rangers played a crucial role in the 17th and 18th-century conflicts between American colonists and Native American tribes. British regular troops were unfamiliar with frontier warfare, leading to the development of Ranger companies to specialize in such tactics. Rangers were full-time soldiers employed by colonial governments to patrol between fixed frontier fortifications in reconnaissance providing early warning of raids. In offensive operations, they were scouts and guides, locating villages and other targets for taskforces drawn from the militia or other colonial troops.

In Colonial America, &quot;The earliest mention of Ranger operations comes from Capt. John &quot;Samuel&quot; Smith&quot;, who wrote in 1622, &quot;When I had ten men able to go abroad, our common wealth was very strong: with such a number I ranged that unknown country 14 weeks.&quot; Robert Black also stated that,

In 1622, after the Berkeley Plantation Massacre... grim-faced men went forth to search out the Indian enemy. They were militia—citizen soldiers—but they were learning to blend the methods of Indian and European warfare... As they went in search of the enemy, the words &quot;range, ranging and Ranger&quot; were frequently used... The American Ranger had been born.

The father of American ranging is Colonel Benjamin Church (c. 1639–1718). He was the captain of the first Ranger force in America (1676). Church was commissioned by the Governor of the Plymouth Colony Josiah Winslow to form the first ranger company for King Philip&#x27;s War. He later employed the company to raid Acadia during King William&#x27;s War and Queen Anne&#x27;s War.

Benjamin Church designed his force primarily to emulate Native American patterns of war. Toward this end, Church endeavored to learn to fight like Native Americans from Native Americans. Americans became rangers exclusively under the tutelage of the Native American allies. (Until the end of the colonial period, rangers depended on Native Americans as both allies and teachers.)

Church developed a special full-time unit mixing white colonists selected for frontier skills with friendly Native Americans to carry out offensive strikes against hostile Native Americans in terrain where normal militia units were ineffective. In 1716, his memoirs, entitled &quot;Entertaining Passages relating to Philip&#x27;s War&quot;, was published and is considered by some to constitute the first American military manual.

Under Church served the father and grandfather of two famous rangers of the eighteenth century: John Lovewell and John Gorham respectively. John Lovewell served during Dummer&#x27;s War (also known as Lovewell&#x27;s War). He lived in present-day Nashua, New Hampshire. He fought in Dummer&#x27;s War as a militia captain, leading three expeditions against the Abenaki tribe. John Lovewell became the most famous Ranger of the eighteenth century.

Many Colonial officers would take the philosophies of Benjamin Church&#x27;s ranging and form their own Ranger units.
During King George&#x27;s War, John Gorham established &quot;Gorham&#x27;s Rangers&quot;. Gorham&#x27;s company fought on the frontier at Acadia and Nova Scotia. Gorham was commissioned a captain in the British Army in recognition of his outstanding service. He was the first of three prominent American rangers–himself, his younger brother Joseph Gorham and Robert Rogers—to earn such commissions in the British Army. (Many others, such as George Washington, were unsuccessful in their attempts to achieve a British rank.)

Rogers&#x27; Rangers was established in 1751 by Major Robert Rogers, who organized nine Ranger companies in the American colonies. Roger&#x27;s Island, in Modern Day Fort Edward, NY, is considered the &quot;spiritual home&quot; of the United States Special Operations Forces, particularly the United States Army Rangers. These early American light infantry units, organized during the French and Indian War, bore the name &quot;Rangers&quot; and were the forerunners of the modern Army Rangers. Major Rogers drafted the first currently-known set of standard orders for rangers. These rules, Robert Rogers&#x27; 28 &quot;Rules of Ranging&quot;, are still provided to all new Army Rangers upon graduation from training, and served as one of the first modern manuals for asymmetric warfare.

===American Revolution===

====Loyalist Rangers====
Fearing that Rogers was a spy, Washington refused to accept Rogers help. An incensed Rogers instead joined forces with the Loyalists, raised the Queen&#x27;s Rangers, and fought for the Crown, giving historical confirmation to Washington&#x27;s concerns about the depth of his patriotism. While serving with the British, Col. Rogers was further responsible for capturing America&#x27;s most famous spy in Nathan Hale.

After Colonel Robert Rogers left the Queen&#x27;s Rangers, he travelled to Nova Scotia, where he raised King&#x27;s Rangers, in 1779. The regiment was disbanded in 1783.

====Continental Rangers====
In 1775, the Continental Congress later formed eight companies of elite light infantry to fight in the Revolutionary War, several notable Rangers-led Continental units such as Jonathan Moulton, Moses Hazen, Simeon Thayer, Nathaniel Hutchins, and Israel Putnam. In 1777, this force commanded by Daniel Morgan, was known as The Corps of Rangers. Francis Marion, &quot;The Swamp Fox&quot;, organized another famous Revolutionary War Ranger element known as &quot;Marion&#x27;s Partisans&quot;. Perhaps the most famous Ranger unit in the Revolutionary War was Butler&#x27;s Rangers, from upstate New York. Continental Army Rangers officers such as John Stark, commanded the  1st New Hampshire Regiment, which gained fame at the Battles of Bunker Hill and Bennington. Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys in Vermont were also designated as a ranger unit.

Later on during the war, General Washington ordered Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Knowlton to select an elite group of men for reconnaissance missions. This unit was known as Knowlton&#x27;s Rangers, and is credited as the first official Ranger unit (by name) for the United States. This unit carried out intelligence functions rather than combat functions in most cases, and as such are not generally considered the historical parent of the modern day Army Rangers.

In June 1775 Ethan Allen and Seth Warner had the Continental Congress create a Continental Ranger Regiment including many of the famed Green Mountain Boys. Warner was elected the Regiment&#x27;s Colonel with the Rangers forming part of the Continental Army&#x27;s Invasion of Quebec in 1775. The Regiment was disbanded in 1779.

Francis Marion, the &quot;Swamp Fox&quot; Revolutionary commander of South Carolina, developed irregular methods of warfare during his guerrilla period in South Carolina. He is credited in the lineage of the Army Rangers, as is George Rogers Clark who led an irregular force of Kentucky/Virginia militiamen to capture the British forts at Vincennes, Indiana and Kaskaskia, Illinois.

===War of 1812===
In January 1812 the United States authorized six companies of United States Rangers who were mounted infantry with the function of protecting the Western frontier. Five of these companies were raised in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky. A sixth was in Middle Tennessee, organized by Capt. David Mason. The next year, 10 new companies were raised. By December 1813 the &quot;Army Register&quot; listed officers of 12 companies of Rangers. The Ranger companies were discharged in June 1815.

===Black Hawk War===
During the Black Hawk War, in 1832, the Battalion of Mounted Rangers, an early version of the cavalry in the U.S. Army was created out of frontiersmen who enlisted for one year and provided their own rifles and horses. The battalion was organized into six companies of 100 men each that was led by Major Henry Dodge. After their enlistment expired there was no creation of a second battalion. Instead, the battalion was reorganized into the 1st Dragoon Regiment.

===Civil War===
Several units that were named and functioned similarly to Rangers fought in the American Civil War between 1861 and 1865, such as the Loudoun Rangers that consisted of Quaker and German farmers from northern Loudoun County. They were founded by Captain Samuel C. Means, a Virginian refugee who was approached by Washington to form two detachments on 20 June 1862. The Loudoun Rangers conducted periodic raids in Loudoun, Clarke and Jefferson counties. Military historian Darl L. Stephenson stated that a unit called the Blazer&#x27;s Scouts were also a precursor to Army Rangers during the Civil War. Aside from conducting similar irregular warfare on Confederate forces in Richmond, Mississippi and Tennessee, its members were also descendants of the first ranger groups, organized by Robert Rogers in the French and Indian War. The Blazer&#x27;s Scouts were instrumental in fighting off other irregular forces such as partisan bushwhackers and Mosby&#x27;s Rangers, another unit of Rangers that fought for the Confederacy.

===World War II===
In WWII, General Lucian Truscott of the U.S. Army, a General Staff submitted a proposal to General George Marshall conceived under the guidance of then Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, that selectively trained Ranger soldiers were recruited for the newly established special operations Army Ranger Battalion. Five Ranger Battalions would be organized in the European Theatre including the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th; the 6th would be organized in the Pacific Theatre. The 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th Ranger Battalions were &quot;Ghost&quot; formations, which were part of the deception plan known as &quot;Operation Quicksilver.&quot;

====European theater====
On 19 June 1942 the 1st Ranger Battalion was sanctioned, recruited, and began training in Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland. Eighty percent of the original Rangers came from the 34th Infantry Division.

A select fifty or so of the first U.S. Rangers were dispersed through the British Commandos for the Dieppe Raid in August 1942; these were the first American soldiers to see ground combat in the European theater.

Together with the ensuing 3rd and 4th Ranger Battalions they fought in North Africa and Italy commanded by Colonel William Orlando Darby until the Battle of Cisterna (29 January 1944) when most of the Rangers of the 1st and 3rd Battalions were captured. Of the 767 men in the battalions 761 were killed or captured. The remaining Rangers were absorbed into the Canadian-American First Special Service Force under Brigadier General Robert T. Frederick. They were then instrumental in operations in and around the Anzio beachhead that followed Operation Shingle.

The 29th Ranger Battalion was a temporary unit made of selected volunteers from the 29th Infantry Division that was in existence from December 1942 to November 1943.

Before the 5th Ranger Battalion landing on Dog White sector on Omaha Beach, during the Invasion of Normandy, the 2nd Ranger Battalion scaled the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc, a few miles to the west, to destroy a five-gun battery of captured French Canon de 155 mm GPF guns. The gun positions were empty on the day and the weapons had been removed some time before to allow the construction of casements in their place. (One of the gun positions was destroyed by the RAF in May—prior to D-day—leaving five missing guns). Under constant fire during their climb, they encountered only a small company of Germans on the cliffs and subsequently discovered a group of field artillery weapons in trees some to the rear. The guns were disabled and destroyed, and the Rangers then cut and held the main road for two days before being relieved. All whilst being reinforced by members of the 5th Ranger Battalion who arrived at 6pm on 6 June from Omaha Beach. More 5th Ranger units arrived by sea on 7 June when some of their wounded along with German prisoners were taken away to the waiting ships.

====Pacific theater====

Two separate Ranger units fought the war in the Pacific Theater. The 98th Field Artillery Battalion was formed on 16 December 1940 and activated at Fort Lewis in January 1941. On 26 September 1944, they were converted from field artillery to light infantry and became 6th Ranger Battalion. 6th Ranger Battalion led the invasion of the Philippines and executed the raid on the Cabanatuan POW camp. They continued fighting in the Philippines until they were deactivated on 30 December 1945, in Japan.

After the first Quebec Conference, the 5307th Composite Unit (provisional) was formed with Frank Merrill as the commander, its 2,997 officers and men became popularly known as Merrill&#x27;s Marauders. They began training in India on 31 October 1943. Much of the Marauders training was based on Major General Orde Wingate of the British Army who specialized in deep penetration raids behind Japanese lines. The 5307th Composite Group was composed of the six color-coded combat teams that would become part of modern Ranger heraldry, they fought against the Japanese during the Burma Campaign. In February 1944, the Marauders began a march over the Himalayan mountain range and through the Burmese jungle to strike behind the Japanese lines. By March, they had managed to cut off Japanese forces in Maingkwan and cut their supply lines in the Hukawng Valley. On 17 May, the Marauders and Chinese forces captured the Myitkyina airfield, the only all-weather airfield in Burma. For their actions, every member of the unit received the Bronze Star.

====Motto====
On 6 June 1944, during the assault landing on Dog White sector of Omaha Beach as part of the invasion of Normandy, then-Brigadier General Norman Cota (assistant division commander of the 29th Infantry Division) approached Major Max Schneider, CO of the 5th Ranger Battalion and asked &quot;What outfit is this?&quot;, Schneider answered &quot;5th Rangers, Sir!&quot; To this, Cota replied &quot;Well, goddamnit, if you&#x27;re Rangers, lead the way!&quot; From this, the Ranger motto—&quot;Rangers lead the way!&quot;—was born.

===Korean War===

At the outbreak of the Korean War, a unique Ranger unit was formed. Led by Second Lieutenant Ralph Puckett, the Eighth Army Ranger Company was created in August 1950. It served as the role model for the rest of the soon to be formed Ranger units. Instead of being organized into self-contained battalions, the Ranger units of the Korean and Vietnam eras were organized into companies and then attached to larger units, to serve as organic special operations units.

In total, sixteen additional Ranger companies were formed in the next seven months: Eighth Army Raider Company and First through Fifteenth Ranger Company. The Army Chief of Staff assigned the Ranger training program at Fort Benning to Colonel John Gibson Van Houten. The program eventually split to include a training program located in Korea. 3rd Ranger Company and the 7th Ranger Company were tasked to train new Rangers.

The next four Ranger companies were formed 28 October 1950. Soldiers from the 505th Airborne Regiment and the 82nd Airborne&#x27;s 80th Anti-aircraft Artillery Battalion volunteered and, after initially being designated the 4th Ranger Company, became the 2nd Ranger Company—the only all-black Ranger unit in United States history. After the four companies had begun their training, they were joined by the 5th–8th Ranger companies on 20 November 1950.

During the course of the war, the Rangers patrolled and probed, scouted and destroyed, attacked and ambushed the Communist Chinese and North Korean enemy. The 1st Rangers destroyed the 12th North Korean Division headquarters in a daring night raid. The 2nd and 4th Rangers made a combat airborne assault near Munsan where Life Magazine reported that Allied troops were now patrolling north of the 38th Parallel. Crucially, the 2nd Rangers plugged the gap made by the retreating Allied forces, the 5th Ranger Company helped stop the Chinese 5th Phase Offensive. As in World War II, after the Korean War, the Rangers were disbanded.

===Vietnam War===

Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (LRRP) and Long Range Patrol companies (commonly known as &quot;Lurps&quot;) were formed by the U.S. Army in the early 1960s in West Germany to provide small, heavily armed reconnaissance teams to patrol deep in enemy-held territory in case of war with the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies.
In Vietnam LRRP platoons and companies were attached to every brigade and division where they perfected the art of long-range patrolling. Since satellite communications were a thing of the future, one of the most daring long-range penetration operations of the Vietnam War was launched on 19 April 1968, by members of the 1st Air Cavalry Division&#x27;s, Company E, 52nd Infantry (LRP), (redesignated Co. H, Ranger), against the NVA when they seized &quot;Signal Hill&quot; the name attributed to the peak of Dong Re Lao Mountain, a densely forested mountain, midway in A Shau Valley, so the 1st and 3rd Brigades, slugging it out hidden deep behind the towering wall of mountains, could communicate with Camp Evans near the coast or with approaching aircraft.

On 1 January 1969, under the new U.S. Army Combat Arms Regimental System (CARS), these units were redesignated &quot;Ranger&quot; in South Vietnam within the 75th Infantry Regiment (Ranger) and all replacement personnel were mandatory airborne qualified. Fifteen companies of Rangers were raised from LRRP units, which had been performing missions in Europe since the early 1960s and in Vietnam since 1966. The genealogy of this new Regiment was linked to Merrill&#x27;s Marauders. The Rangers were organized as independent companies: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O and P, with one notable exception, since 1816, U.S. Army units have not included a Juliet or &quot;J&quot; company, (the reason for this is because the letter &#x27;J&#x27; looked too similar to the letter &#x27;I&#x27; in Old English script). Companies A and B were respectively assigned to V Corps at Fort Hood, Texas, and VII Corps at Fort Lewis, Washington.

In addition to scouting and reconnoitering roles for their parent formations, Ranger units provided terrain-assessment and tactical or special security missions; undertook recovery operations to locate and retrieve prisoners of war; captured enemy soldiers for interrogation and intelligence-gathering purposes; tapped North Vietnamese Army and Vietcong wire communications lines in their established base areas along the Ho Chi Minh trail; and mined enemy trails as well as motor-vehicle transport routes. To provide tactical skills and patrol expertise all LRRP/Ranger team leaders and most assistant team leaders were graduates of the 5th Special Forces Group Recondo School at Nha Trang Vietnam.
==Post-Vietnam era==

After the Vietnam War, division and brigade commanders determined that the U.S. Army needed an elite, rapidly deployable light infantry, so on 31 January 1974 General Creighton Abrams asked General Kenneth C. Leuer to activate, organize, train and command the first battalion sized Ranger unit since World War II. Initially, the 1st Ranger Battalion was constituted; because of its success, eight months later, 1 October 1974, the 2nd Ranger Battalion was constituted, and in 1984 the 3rd Ranger Battalion and their regimental headquarters were created. In 1986, the 75th Ranger Regiment was formed and their military lineage formally authorized. The regiment, comprising three battalions, is the premier light infantry unit of the U.S. Army, a combination of special operations and elite airborne light infantry. The regiment is a flexible, highly trained and rapid light infantry unit specialized to be employed against any special operations targets. All Rangers—whether they are in the 75th Ranger Regiment, or Ranger School, or both—are taught to live by the Ranger Creed. Primary tasks include: direct action, national and international emergency crisis response, airfield seizure, airborne &amp; air assault operations, special reconnaissance, intelligence &amp; counter intelligence, combat search and rescue, personnel recovery &amp; hostage rescue, joint special operations, and counter terrorism.
The 4th, 5th, and 6th Ranger Battalions were re-activated as the Ranger Training Brigade, the cadre of instructors of the contemporary Ranger School; moreover, because they are parts of a TRADOC school, the 4th, 5th, and 6th battalions are not a part of the 75th Ranger Regiment.

The Rangers have participated in numerous operations throughout modern history. In 1980, the Rangers were involved with Operation Eagle Claw, the 1980 second rescue attempt of American hostages in Tehran, Iran. In 1983, the 1st and 2nd Ranger Battalions conducted Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada. All three Ranger battalions, with a headquarters element, participated in the U.S. invasion of Panama (Operation Just Cause) in 1989. In 1991 Bravo Company, the first platoon and Anti-Tank section from Alpha Company, 1st Battalion was deployed in the Persian Gulf War (Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield). Bravo Company, 3rd Ranger Battalion was the base unit of &quot;Task Force Ranger&quot; in Operation Gothic Serpent, in Somalia in 1993, concurrent with Operation Restore Hope. In 1994, soldiers from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Ranger Battalions deployed to Haiti (before the operation&#x27;s cancellation. The force was recalled from the Haitian coast.). The 3rd Ranger Battalion supported the initial war effort in Afghanistan, in 2001. The Ranger Regiment has been involved in multiple deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom since 2003.

===War on Terror===

In response to the 11 September terrorist strikes, the United States launched the War on Terror with the invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001. Special operations units such as the Rangers, along with some CIA officers and Navy SEALs were the first U.S. forces on Afghan soil during Operation Enduring Freedom. This was the first large Ranger operation since the Battle of Mogadishu.

The Rangers met with success during the invasion aimed at overthrowing the Taliban government, in which they participated in two operations to secure strategic areas in Kandahar Province in Southern Afghanistan.

The first operation, Operation Rhino, was designed to take control of a landing strip from the Taliban that would be useful for future missions. The Rangers faced little opposition during their attack on the airfield and didn&#x27;t suffer any casualties during the mission. However, two Rangers from another group who were assigned to provide rescue support from a location in Pakistan died when their helicopter crashed. The seized landing strip would later become known as Camp Rhino.

The second operation after seizing the airstrip was a supporting mission to assist Delta Force in an operation to raid a Taliban compound, known as Objective Gecko, in which the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, was rumoured to be hiding. The Rangers set up blocking positions while Delta Force secured the compound. There were no Taliban inside the compound itself, but both the Rangers and Delta Force were ambushed by a group of Taliban fighters as they prepared to leave the area. During the ensuing firefight, one soldier reportedly had his foot blown off by an RPG.

These two operations have been the subject of intense debate, with critics contending that they put the soldiers at unnecessary risk and had no clear strategic value or intelligence gains. There are even some who suggest that politicians in Washington ordered these operations purely for political gain, using soldiers as pawns to advance their own interests.

The following year, the Rangers also participated in the biggest firefight of Operation Anaconda in 2002 at Takur Ghar.

In 2003, when the United States invaded Iraq, the Rangers were among those sent in. During the beginning of the war, they faced some of Iraq&#x27;s elite Republican Guard units. Rangers were also involved in the rescue of American prisoner of war POW Private First Class Jessica Lynch. The 75th Ranger Regiment has been one of the few units to have members continuously deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.

== Army National Guard Ranger Companies ==
In 1967 the Indiana National Guard formed two Long Range Patrol Companies followed by the Michigan National Guard in 1968 using leftover personnel from National Guard Airborne Infantry Battalions. Under the Combat Arms Regimental System (CARS) order of 1969, all LRP/LRRP were redesignated Ranger Companies through TO&amp;E 7-157(E, G, and later H), active component Ranger Companies were consolidated into 75th Infantry Regiment, while the only change in National Guard designations were from LRP to Ranger. Three more National guard Ranger Companies were later formed along with unit consolidations in Indiana and Michigan. Overall there were eight companies spanning their twenty-year history. There were a total of seven National Guard Ranger companies during the Vietnam conflict but not more than five during any given time. Co D (Ranger) 151st Infantry was the only reserve component Infantry unit to see combat in Vietnam and emerged as one of the most decorated Infantry companies throughout the war. At close of the Vietnam conflict, the Abrams Charter reorganized the Active Component Ranger Companies into Ranger Battalions while only three independent Ranger Companies remained throughout the US Army&#x27;s arsenal and resided solely in the National Guard using Vietnam era TO&amp;E 7-157. In the late 1970s the number shrunk to two companies after deactivation of the famed D co (Ranger) 151st Infantry. Upon the Deactivation of Texas National Guard&#x27;s 36th Airborne Infantry Brigade, the TO&amp;E 7-157 and Ranger designation from a Company in Puerto Rico National Guard was transferred to an Airborne Infantry Company in Texas. During much of the 1980s the National Guard&#x27;s only two Ranger Companies were F co (Ranger) 425th Infantry and G co (Ranger) 143rd Infantry. These two ranger units were aligned with I Corps and III Corps respectively while continuing to follow TO&amp;E 7-157 during training with foreign special operations units and while participating in large scale NATO exercises in Europe. During this time the Active Component were also separately developing the Long Range Surveillance (LRS) doctrine through Provisional companies in the 1st Infantry Division, 9th Infantry Division, and 82nd Airborne Division. In 1984 the Army adopted LRS doctrine and in 1985 the Active component and National Guard began forming a LRS detachment (LRSD) for every maneuver Division and a LRS company (LRSC) for every Corps, essentially stripping the ranger designations from the last two National Guard companies. In 1987 F/425 continued with I Corps, G/143 with III Corps, both as LRSCs, and D/151 returned as Trp F 1st 238 Cavalry (LRSU). In 2016 the 151st LRSD, the final National Guard LRSU with &quot;Ranger lineage,&quot; was redesignated into a light infantry company, ending the final chapter on National Guard Ranger/LRRP Companies and their unique legacy.

All National Guard Ranger company veterans and their successors are recognized for active membership into the Long Range Reconnaissance Association (LRRA); D co (Ranger) 151st Infantry an their successors are recognized for regular membership into the 75th Ranger Regiment Association (75RRA) due to their D/75 combat affiliation during the Vietnam Conflict;. However, the US Army Ranger Association (USARA) uses The Institute of Heraldry (an Army regalia, insignia, and symbolism authority, not a lineage authority like the CMH) instead of Official DA Organizational Authority (OA) letters demonstrating assigned TOE 7-157G and 7-157H (Abn Inf Ranger Co) as their rational for eligibility, and only recognizes E co (Ranger) 65th Infantry, D co (Ranger) 151st Infantry, and their predecessors as National Guard unit eligibility for regular membership.

On July 5, 2022, the House Armed Services Committee directed the Secretary of the Army to submit a report no later than March 1, 2023 on assessing the feasibility of establishing Ranger Battalion in the National Guard, which included the required resources and timeline for activating the unit. Additionally, the committee requested to assess the feasibility of the Army National Guard and the 75th Ranger Regiment for allowing physically and mentally qualified service members within the National Guard to apply for Ranger Assessment and Selection Program (RASP). The committee recognized that the National Guard currently maintains two Special Forces Groups as a relief for active component Special Forces. The idea for creation of a National Guard Ranger Battalion is intended to provide increased dwell times for the active 75th Ranger Regiment and enhance the readiness and capacity of the nation’s premier light infantry unit. Discussions over the renewed concept have surged on public social media platforms and public US Army platforms since then.

==Ranger School==
Ranger training began in September 1950 at Fort Benning, Georgia &quot;with the formation and training of 17 Airborne Companies by the Ranger Training Command&quot;. The first class graduated from Ranger training in November 1950.&quot; The United States Army&#x27;s Infantry School officially established the Ranger Department in December 1951. Under the Ranger Department, the first Ranger School Class was conducted in January–March 1952, with a graduation date of 1March 1952. Its duration was 59 days. At the time, Ranger training was voluntary.

In 1966, a panel headed by General Ralph E. Haines, Jr. recommended making Ranger training mandatory for all Regular Army officers upon commissioning. &quot;On 16 August 1966, the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Harold K. Johnson, directed it so.&quot; This policy was implemented in July 1967. It was rescinded on 21 June 1972 by General William Westmoreland. Once again, Ranger training was voluntary. In August 1987, the Ranger Department was split from the Infantry School and the Ranger Training Brigade was established, commanded by Brigadier General (R) James Emory Mace.

The Ranger Companies that made up the Ranger Department became the current training units—the 4th, 5th and 6th Ranger Training Battalions. These units conduct the United States Army&#x27;s Ranger School at various locations at Fort Benning, Georgia, Camp Frank Merrill, near Dahlonega, Georgia, and Camp James Rudder at Eglin Air Force Base&#x27;s Auxiliary Field No. 6/Biancur Field, in northwest Florida. As of 2011, the school is 61 days in duration.

In August 2015, two women graduated from Ranger School; they were the &quot;first females to successfully complete the notoriously gruelling program&quot;.

==Ranger Creed==

:Recognizing that I volunteered as a Ranger, fully knowing the hazards of my chosen profession, I will always endeavor to uphold the prestige, honor, and high esprit de corps of my Ranger Regiment.

:Acknowledging the fact that a Ranger is a more elite soldier who arrives at the cutting edge of battle by land, sea, or air, I accept the fact that as a Ranger my country expects me to move further, faster, and fight harder than any other soldier.

:Never shall I fail my comrades. I will always keep myself mentally alert, physically strong, and morally straight and I will shoulder more than my share of the task whatever it may be, one hundred percent and then some.

:Gallantly will I show the world that I am a specially selected and well trained soldier. My courtesy to superior officers, neatness of dress, and care of equipment shall set the example for others to follow.

:Energetically will I meet the enemies of my country. I shall defeat them on the field of battle for I am better trained and will fight with all my might. Surrender is not a Ranger word. I will never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy and under no circumstances will I ever embarrass my country.

:Readily will I display the intestinal fortitude required to fight on to the Ranger objective and complete the mission, though I be the lone survivor.

:&quot;Rangers, lead the way.&quot;

==&quot;Ranger&quot; terminology==
Organizations both use and define the term &quot;Ranger&quot; in different ways. For example, the annual Best Ranger Competition, hosted by the Ranger Training Brigade, the title &quot;Best Ranger&quot; can be won by any Ranger qualified entrants from any unit in the U.S. military. For an individual to be inducted into the U.S. Army Ranger Association&#x27;s &quot;Ranger Hall of Fame&quot; they &quot;must have served in a Ranger unit in combat or be a successful graduate of the U.S. Army Ranger School.&quot; The Ranger Association further clarifies the type of unit: &quot;A Ranger unit is defined as those Army units recognized in Ranger lineage or history.&quot; Acceptance into the U.S. Army Ranger Association is limited to &quot;Rangers that have earned the U.S. Army Ranger tab, WWII Rangers, Korean War Rangers, Vietnam War Rangers, all Rangers that participated in Operations Urgent Fury, Just Cause, Desert Storm, Restore Hope, Enduring Freedom, and all Rangers who have served honorably for at least one year in a recognized Ranger unit.&quot;

==Ranger Hall of Honor==
The U.S. Army Ranger Hall of Honor was established in 1952. It is hosted at the National Infantry Museum in Columbus, Georgia, which also hosts the U.S. Army Officer Candidate School Hall of Honor.

The Ranger of Hall of Fame features a digital kiosk with over 200 biographies and portraits of inductees.

<doc id="418109" wikidata="Q214407" url="?curid=418109" title="Félix Houphouët-Boigny">
<text>Félix Houphouët-Boigny (; 18 October 1905 – 7 December 1993), affectionately called Papa Houphouët or Le Vieux (&quot;The Old One&quot;), was an Ivorian politician and physician who served as the first president of Ivory Coast from 1960 until his death in 1993. A tribal chief, he worked as a medical aide, union leader, and planter before being elected to the French Parliament in 1945. He served in several ministerial positions within the Government of France before leading Ivory Coast following independence in 1960. Throughout his life, he played a significant role in politics and the decolonisation of Africa.

Under Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s politically moderate leadership, Ivory Coast prospered economically. This success, uncommon in poverty-ridden West Africa, became known as the &quot;Ivorian miracle&quot;; it was due to a combination of sound planning, the maintenance of strong ties with the West (particularly France) and development of the country&#x27;s significant coffee and cocoa industries. However, reliance on the agricultural sector caused difficulties in 1980, after a sharp drop in the prices of coffee and cocoa.

Throughout his presidency, Houphouët-Boigny maintained a close relationship with France, a policy known as Françafrique, and he built a close friendship with Jacques Foccart, the chief adviser on African policy in the regimes of Charles de Gaulle and Georges Pompidou. He aided the conspirators who ousted Kwame Nkrumah from power in Ghana in 1966, took part in the failed coup against Mathieu Kérékou in Benin in 1977, was suspected of involvement in the 1987 coup d&#x27;état that removed Thomas Sankara from power in Burkina Faso and provided assistance to UNITA, a United States-supported, anti-communist rebel movement in Angola. Houphouët-Boigny maintained a strong anti-communist foreign policy, which resulted in, among other things, severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1969 (after first establishing relations in 1967) and refusing to recognise the People&#x27;s Republic of China until 1983. He re-established relations with the Soviet Union in 1986.

In the West, Houphouët-Boigny was commonly known as the &quot;Sage of Africa&quot; or the &quot;Grand Old Man of Africa&quot;. Houphouët-Boigny moved the country&#x27;s capital from Abidjan to his hometown of Yamoussoukro and built the world&#x27;s largest church there, the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, at a cost of US$300 million. At the time of his death, he was the longest-serving leader in Africa&#x27;s history and the third longest-serving leader in the world after Fidel Castro of Cuba and Kim Il Sung of North Korea. In 1989, UNESCO created the Félix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize for the &quot;safeguarding, maintaining and seeking of peace&quot;. After his death, conditions in Ivory Coast quickly deteriorated. Between 1994 and 2002, there were a number of coups, a devaluation of the CFA franc and an economic recession; a civil war began in 2002.

==Early life==

===Birth, childhood and education===

According to his official biography, Houphouët-Boigny was probably born on 18 October 1905, in Yamoussoukro to a family of hereditary chiefs of the Baoulé people. Unofficial accounts, however, place his birth date up to seven years earlier. Born into the animist Akouès tribe, he was named Dia Houphouët: his first name &quot;Dia&quot; means &quot;prophet&quot; or &quot;magician&quot;. His father was N&#x27;Doli Houphouët. Dia Houphouët was the great-nephew through his mother of Queen Yamousso and the village chief, Kouassi N&#x27;Go. When N&#x27;Go was murdered in 1910, Dia was named to succeed him as chief. Due to his young age, his stepfather Gbro Diby ruled as regent until Dia came of age; Dia&#x27;s father had already died.

Houphouët-Boigny descended from tribal chiefs through his mother, Kimou N&#x27;Dri (also known as N&#x27;Dri Kan). She died much later in 1936. Doubts remain as to the identity of his father, N&#x27;Doli. Officially a native of the N&#x27;Zipri of Didiévi tribe, N&#x27;Doli Houphouët died shortly after the birth of his son Augustin, although no reliable information regarding his death exists. Houphouët-Boigny had two elder sisters, Faitai (1898?–1998) and Adjoua (d. 1987), as well as a younger brother Augustin (d. 1939).

The French colonial administration recognised tribal leaders; they arranged to have Houphouët go to school at the military post in Bonzi, not far from his village, to prepare for his future as a leader, despite strenuous objections from relatives, especially his great-aunt Queen Yamousso. In 1915, he was transferred to the &quot;école primaire supérieure&quot; (secondary) at Bingerville in spite of his family&#x27;s reluctance to have him go to boarding school. The same year, at Bingerville, Houphouët converted to Christianity; he considered it a modern religion and an obstacle to the spread of Islam. He chose to be christened Félix.

First in his class, Houphouët was accepted into the &quot;École normale supérieure William Ponty&quot; in 1919, and earned a teaching degree. In 1921, he attended the &quot;École de médecine de l&#x27;AOF&quot; (French West Africa School of Medicine) in French Senegal, where he came first in his class in 1925 and qualified as a medical assistant. As he never completed his studies in medicine, he could qualify only as a &quot;médecin africain&quot;, a poorly paid doctor.

===Medical career===
On 26 October 1925, Houphouët began his career as a doctor&#x27;s aide at a hospital in Abidjan, where he founded an association of indigenous medical personnel. This undertaking proved short-lived as the colonial administration viewed it unsympathetically, considering it a trade union. As a consequence, they decided to move Houphouët to a lesser hospital in Guiglo on 27 April 1927. After he proved his considerable talents, however, he was promoted on 17 September 1929 to a post in Abengourou, which until then had been reserved for Europeans. At Abengourou, Houphouët witnessed the mistreatment of indigenous cocoa farmers by the colonists.

In 1932, he decided to act, leading a movement of farmers against the influential white landowners and for the economic policies of the colonial government, who favoured the farmers. On 22 December, he published an article titled &quot;On nous a trop volés&quot; (They have stolen too much from us), in the &quot;Trait d&#x27;union&quot;, an Ivorian socialist newspaper. It was published under a pseudonym.

The following year, Houphouët was called by his tribe to assume the responsibilities of village chief. Preferring to pursue his medical career, he relinquished the office to his younger brother Augustin. Wishing to live closer to his village, he obtained a transfer to Dimbokro on 3 February 1934 and then to Toumodi on 28 June 1936. While Houphouët had displayed professional qualities, his attitude had chafed those around him. As a result, in September 1938, his clinical director demanded that he choose between his job as a doctor and his involvement in local politics. The choice was quickly made for him: his brother died in 1939, and Houphouët became the &quot;chef de canton&quot; (an office created by the colonial administration to collect taxes). Due to this, Houphouët ended his medical career the next year.

===First marriage===
In 1930, Houphouët married Kady Racine Sow (1913–2006) in Abengourou; their union was controversial because he was a practising Catholic and she was the daughter of a wealthy Muslim from Senegal. The families of the two eventually overcame their opposition and accepted the interfaith union, the first ever celebrated in Ivory Coast. The couple had five children: Felix (who died in infancy), Augustine, Francis, Guillaume and Marie, all raised as Catholics.

===&quot;Chef de canton&quot; and union leader===
By becoming &quot;chef de canton&quot;, Houphouët assumed responsibility for the administration of Akouè, a canton which comprised 36 villages. He also took charge of the family plantation—at the time one of the most important in the country—and worked to diversify its rubber, cocoa and coffee crops. He soon became one of Africa&#x27;s richest farmers. On 3 September 1944, he established, in cooperation with the colonial administration, the African Agricultural Union (&quot;Syndicat agricole africain&quot;, SAA). Under his presidency, the SAA brought together African farmers who were dissatisfied with their working conditions and worked to protect their interests against those of European planters. Anti-colonialist and anti-racist, the organisation demanded better working conditions, higher wages, and the abolition of the forced labour. The union quickly received the support of nearly 20,000 plantation workers, together with that of the left-wing French administrators placed in office by the Provisional Government. Its success irritated colonists to the extent that they took legal action against Houphouët, accusing him of being anti-French for never seeking French citizenship. However, Houphouët befriended the Inspector Minister of the Colonies, who ordered the charges dropped. They were more successful in obtaining the replacement of the sympathetic Governor André Latrille with the hostile Governor Henry de Mauduit.

Houphouët entered electoral politics in August 1945, when elections for the Abidjan city council were held for the first time. The French electoral rules established a common roll: half of the elected would have to be French citizens (who were mostly Europeans) and the other half non-citizens. Houphouët reacted by creating a multi-ethnic all-African roll with both non-citizens and citizens (mostly Senegalese with French citizenship). As a result, most of the African contenders withdrew and a large number of the French protested by abstaining, thus assuring a decisive victory for his African Bloc.

In October 1945, Houphouët moved onto the national political scene; the French government decided to represent its colonies in the &quot;assemblée constituante&quot; (&quot;Constituent Assembly&quot;) and gave Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Upper Volta two representatives in Parliament combined. One of these would represent the French citizens and another would represent the indigenous population, but the suffrage was limited to less than 1% of the population. In an attempt to block Houphouët, the governor de Mauduit supported a rival candidature, and provided him the full backing of the administration. Despite that and thanks to the SAA&#x27;s strong organization, Houphouët, running for the indigenous seat, easily came first with a -vote majority. He failed, however, to obtain a majority, due to the large number of candidates running. Houphouët emerged victorious again in the second round of elections held on 4 November 1945, in which he narrowly defeated an Upper Voltan candidate with votes out of a total of . At this point, he decided to add &quot;Boigny&quot; to his surname, meaning &quot;irresistible force&quot; in Baoulé and symbolizing his role as a leader.

==French political career==

===Member of Parliament===

In taking his seat at the National Assembly in the Palais Bourbon alongside compatriots Daniel Ouezzin Coulibaly and Zinda Kaboré, Houphouët-Boigny had to first decide with which group to side, and he opted for the &quot;Mouvements unis de la Résistance&quot; (&quot;Unified Resistance Movements&quot;), a small party composed of Communist sympathizers but not formal members of the Communist Party. He was appointed a member of the &quot;Commission des territoires d&#x27;outre-mer&quot; (Commission of Overseas Territories). During this time, he worked to implement the wishes of the SAA, in particular proposing a bill to abolish forced labor—the single most unpopular feature of French rule. The Assembly adopted this bill, known as &quot;Loi Houphouët-Boigny&quot;, on 11 April 1946, greatly enhancing the author&#x27;s prestige beyond his country. On 3 April 1946, Houphouët-Boigny proposed to unify labour regulations in the territories of Africa; this would eventually be completed in 1952. Finally, on 27 September 1946, he filed a report on the public health system of overseas territories, calling for its reformation. Houphouët-Boigny in his parliamentary tenure supported the idea of a union of French territories.

As the first constitution proposed by the Constituent Assembly was rejected by the voters, new elections were held in 1946 for a second constituent assembly. For these elections Houphouët-Boigny organized on 9 April 1946, with the help of the Communist Study Groups, the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast – African Democratic Rally (PDCI), whose structure closely followed that of the SAA. It immediately became the first successful independent African party when the new party Houphouët-Boigny easily swept the elections with out of votes, his opponents obtaining only a few hundred votes each. In this he was helped by the recall of Governor Latrille, whose predecessor had been fired by the Overseas Minister Marius Moutet for his opposition to the abolition of the &quot;indigénat&quot;.

With his return to the assembly he was appointed to the &quot;Commission du règlement et du suffrage universel&quot; (Commission for Regulation of Universal Suffrage); as secretary of the commission from 1947 to 1948, he proposed on 18 February 1947 to reform French West Africa (AOF), French Equatorial Africa (AEF), and the French territories&#x27; federal council to better represent the African peoples. He also called for the creation of local assemblies in Africa so that Africans could learn how to be politically autonomous.

===Foundation of the RDA and Communist alliance===
During the holding of the second Constituent Assembly the African representatives witnessed a strong reaction against the colonial liberalism that had been embedded in the rejected constitution drafted by the previous assembly. The new text, approved by the voters on 13 October 1946, reduced the African representatives from 30 to 24, and reduced the number of those entitled to vote; also, a large number of colonial topics were left in which the executive could govern by decree, and supervision over the colonial administration remained weak. Reacting to what they felt was a betrayal of the MRP&#x27;s and the Socialists&#x27; promises, the African deputies concluded they needed to build a permanent coalition independent from the French parties. Houphouët-Boigny was the first to propose this to his African colleagues, and obtained their full support for a founding congress to be held in October at Bamako in French Sudan. The French government did all it could to sabotage the congress, and in particular the Socialist Overseas Minister was successful in persuading the African Socialists, who were originally among the promoters, from attending. This ultimately backfired, radicalizing those convened; when they founded the African Democratic Rally (RDA) as an inter-territorial political movement, it was the pro-Communist Gabriel d&#x27;Arboussier who dominated the congress. The new movement&#x27;s goal was to free &quot;Africa from the colonial yoke by the affirmation of her personality and by the association, freely agreed to, of a union of nations&quot;. Its first president, confirmed several times subsequently, was Houphouët-Boigny, while d&#x27;Arboussier became secretary-general. As part of the bringing of the territorial parties in the organization, the PDCI became the Ivoirian branch of the RDA.

Too small to form their own parliamentary group, the African deputies were compelled to join one of the larger parties to sit together in the Palais Bourbon. Thus, the RDA soon joined the French Communist Party (PCF) as the only openly anti-colonialist political faction and soon organised strikes and boycotts of European imports. Houphouët-Boigny justified the alliance because it seemed, at the time, to be the only way for his voice to be heard: &quot;Even before the creation of RDA, the alliance had served our cause: in March 1946, the abolition of compulsory labour was adopted unanimously, without a vote, thanks to our tactical alliance.&quot; During his stays in Paris, he travelled in a black limousine to the PCF executive school. On the strength of this contrast, he defends himself from any communist sympathy: &quot;Can I, Houphouet, traditional leader, doctor, big owner, Catholic, can we say that I am a communist?&quot;

As the Cold War set in, the alliance with the Communists became increasingly damaging for the RDA. The French colonial administration showed itself increasingly hostile toward the RDA and its president, whom the administration called a &quot;Stalinist&quot;. Repression against his party, the PDCI, was increasing in Ivory Coast. Activists are regularly arrested and beaten by police officers, sometimes with acts of torture; others are fired from their jobs. One of the party&#x27;s main leaders, Senator Biaka Boda, was found hanging and shredded in the forest while wanted by the police. Houphouët-Boigny was afraid for his life and for the existence of the movement. Tensions reached their height at the beginning of 1950, when, following an outbreak of anti-colonial violence, almost the entire PDCI leadership was arrested; Houphouët-Boigny managed to slip away shortly before police arrived at his house. Although Houphouët-Boigny would have been saved by his parliamentary immunity, his missed arrest was popularly attributed to his influence and his prestige. In the ensuing chaos, riots broke out in Ivory Coast; the most significant of which was a clash with the police at Dimbokro in which 13 Africans were killed and 50 wounded. According to official figures, by 1951 a total of 52 Africans had been killed, several hundred wounded and around 3,000 arrested (numbers which, according to an opinion reported by journalist Ronald Segal in &quot;African Profiles&quot;, are certainly underestimated). To defuse the crisis, Prime Minister René Pleven entrusted the France&#x27;s Minister for Overseas Territories, François Mitterrand, with the task of detaching the RDA from the PCF, and in fact an official alliance between the RDA and Mitterrand&#x27;s party, the UDSR, was established in 1952. Knowing he was at an impasse, in October 1950, Houphouët-Boigny agreed to break the Communist alliance. Asked in an undated interview why he worked with the communists, Houphouët-Boigny replied: &quot;I, a bourgeois landowner, I would preach the class struggle? That is why we aligned ourselves with the Communist Party, without joining it.&quot; A 1954 report from the French military authorities points out that Houphouët-Boigny &quot;conducted his game alone with great flexibility, procrastination and Machiavellian roueries, refraining from convening either the Coordination Committee or the party congress, which could have opposed this volte-face and gradually became a pro-administrative party. The secretary general of the RDA, Gabriel d&#x27;Arboussier, denounced this new line and left the party. Similarly, the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, the Union démocratique sénégalaise and the Niger Democratic Union refuse to sever their relations with the PCF and the CGT&quot;.

===Rehabilitation and entry into government===
In the 1951 elections, the number of seats was reduced from three to two; while Houphouët-Boigny still won a seat, the other RDA candidate, Ouezzin Coulibaly, did not. All in all, the RDA only garnered of votes in that election, and the party in direct opposition to it captured a seat. On 8 August 1951, Boigny, speaking at René Pleven&#x27;s inauguration as president of the board, denied being the leader of a communist group; he was not believed until the RDA&#x27;s 1952 affiliation with UDSR. On the 24th of that same month, Boigny delivered a statement in the Assembly contesting the result of the elections, which he declared tainted by fraud. He also denounced what he saw as the exploitation of overseas deputies as &quot;voting machines&quot;, who, as political pawns, supported the colonial government&#x27;s every action. Thereafter, Houphouët-Boigny and the RDA were briefly unsuccessful before their success was renewed in 1956; at that year&#x27;s elections, the party received of votes cast. From then on, his relationship with Communism was forgotten, and he was embraced as a moderate. Named as a member of the Committees on Universal Suffrage (distinct from the aforementioned committee &quot;regulating&quot; said suffrage), Constitutional Laws, Rules and Petitions. On 1 February 1956, he was appointed Minister Discharging the Duties of the Presidency of the Council in the government of Guy Mollet, a post he held until 13 June 1957. This marked the first time an African was elected to such a senior position in the French government. His principal achievement in this role was the creation of an organisation of Saharan regions that would help ensure sustainability for the French Union and counter Moroccan territorial claims in the Sahara.

He said nothing against the First Indochina War or against Guy Mollet&#x27;s vote for special powers to repress the insurrection of the National Liberation Front in Algeria.

On 6 November 1957, Houphouët-Boigny became Minister of Public Health and Population in the Gaillard administration and attempted to reform the public health code. He had previously served as Minister of State under Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury (13 June – 6 November 1957). Following his Gaillard ministry, he was again appointed Minister of State from 14 May 1958;– 20 May 1959. In this capacity, he participated in the development of France&#x27;s African policy, notably in the cultural domain. At his behest, the Bureau of French Overseas Students and the University of Dakar were created. On 4 October 1958, Houphouët-Boigny was one of the signatories, along with de Gaulle, of the Constitution of the Fifth Republic. The last post he held in France was Minister-Counsellor in the Michel Debré government, from 23 July 1959 to 19 May 1961.

===Leading up to independence===

Until the mid-1950s, French colonies in west and central Africa were grouped within two federations: French Equatorial Africa (AEF) and French West Africa (AOF). Côte d&#x27;Ivoire was part of the AOF, financing roughly two-thirds of its budget. Wishing to free the country from the guardianship of the AOF, Houphouët-Boigny advocated an Africa made up of nations that would generate wealth rather than share poverty and misery. He participated actively in the drafting and adoption of the framework of the Defferre Loi Cadre, a French legal reform which, in addition to granting autonomy to African colonies, would break the ties that bound the different territories together, giving them more autonomy by means of local assemblies. The Deffere Loi Cadre was far from unanimously accepted by Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s compatriots in Africa: Léopold Sédar Senghor, leader of Senegal, was the first to speak out against this attempted &quot;Balkanization&quot; of Africa, arguing that the colonial territories &quot;do not correspond to any reality: be it geographical, economic, ethnic, or linguistic&quot;. Senghor argued that maintaining the AOF would give the territories stronger political credibility and would allow them to develop harmoniously as well as emerge as a genuine people. This view was shared by most members of the African Democratic Rally, who backed Ahmed Sékou Touré and Modibo Keïta, placing Houphouët-Boigny in the minority at the 1957 congress in Bamako.

Following the adoption of the Loi Cadre reform on 23 June 1956, a territorial election was held in Ivory Coast on 3 March 1957, in which the PDCI—transformed under Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s firm control into a political machine—won many seats. Houphouët-Boigny, who was already serving as a minister in France, as President of the Territorial Assembly and as mayor of Abidjan, chose Auguste Denise to serve as Vice President of the Government Council of Ivory Coast, even though Houphouët-Boigny remained, the only interlocutor in the colony for France. Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s popularity and influence in France&#x27;s African colonies had become so pervasive that one French magazine claimed that by 1956, the politician&#x27;s photograph &quot;was in all the huts, on the lapels of coats, on the corsages of African women and even on the handlebars of bicycles&quot;.

On 7 April 1957, the prime minister of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, on a visit to Ivory Coast, called on all colonies in Africa to declare their independence; Houphouët-Boigny retorted to Nkrumah:

Unlike many African leaders who immediately demanded independence, Houphouët-Boigny wished for a careful transition within the &quot;ensemble français&quot; because, according to him, political independence without economic independence was worthless. He also invited Nkrumah to meet up with him in 10 years to see which one of the two had chosen the best approach toward independence.
On 28 September 1958 Charles de Gaulle proposed a constitutional referendum to the Franco-African community: the territories were given the choice of either supporting the constitution or proclaiming their independence and being cut off from France. For Houphouët-Boigny, the choice was simple: &quot;Whatever happens, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire will enter directly to the Franco-African community. The other territories are free to group between themselves before joining.&quot; Only Guinea chose independence; its leader, Ahmed Sékou Touré, opposed Houphouët-Boigny, stating that his preference was &quot;freedom in poverty over wealth in slavery&quot;. The referendum produced the French Community, an institution meant to be an association of free republics which had jurisdiction over foreign policy, defense, currency, common ethnic and financial policy, and strategic raw materials.

Houphouët-Boigny was determined to stop the hegemony of Senegal in West Africa and a political confrontation ensued between Ivorian and Senegalese leaders. Houphouët-Boigny refused to participate in the Inter-African conference in Dakar on 31 December 1958, which was intended to lay the foundation for the Federation of Francophone African States. Although that federation was never realised, Senegal and Mali (known at the time as French Sudan) formed their own political union, the Mali Federation. After de Gaulle allowed the Mali Federation independence in 1959, Houphouët-Boigny tried to sabotage the federation&#x27;s efforts to wield political control; in cooperation with France, he managed to convince Upper Volta, Dahomey, and Niger to withdraw from the Mali Federation, before it collapsed in August 1960.

Two months after the 1958 referendum, seven member states of French West Africa, including Ivory Coast, became autonomous republics within the French Community. Houphouët-Boigny had won his first victory against those supporting federalism. This victory established the conditions that made the future &quot;Ivorian miracle&quot; possible, since between 1957 and 1959, budget revenues grew by 158%, reaching 21,723,000,000 CFA francs.

==President of Ivory Coast==

===Early years and second marriage===

Houphouët-Boigny officially became the head of the government of Ivory Coast on 1 May 1959. Although he faced no opposition from rival parties and the PDCI became the &quot;de facto&quot; party of the state in 1957, he was confronted by opposition from his own government. Radical nationalists, led by Jean-Baptiste Mockey, openly opposed the government&#x27;s Francophile policies. In an attempt to solve this problem, Houphouët-Boigny decided to exile Mockey in September 1959, claiming that Mockey had attempted to assassinate him using voodoo in what Houphouët-Boigny called the &quot;complot du chat noir&quot; (black cat conspiracy).

Houphouët-Boigny began drafting a new constitution for Ivory Coast after the country&#x27;s independence from France on 7 August 1960. It drew heavily from the United States Constitution in establishing a powerful executive branch, and from the Constitution of France, which limited the capacities of the legislature. He transformed the National Assembly into a mere recording house for bills and budget proposals. On 27 November 1960, Houphouët-Boigny was elected unopposed to the Presidency of the Republic, while a single list of PDCI candidates was elected to the National Assembly.

1963 was marked by a series of alleged plots that played a decisive role in ultimately consolidating power in the hands of Houphouët-Boigny. There is no clear consensus on the unfolding of the 1963 events; in fact, there may have been no plot at all and the entire series of events may have been part of a plan by Houphouët-Boigny to consolidate his hold on power. Between 120 and 200 secret trials were held in Yamoussoukro, in which key political figures—including Mockey and the president of the Supreme Court Ernest Boka—were implicated. There was discontent in the army, as the generals grew restive following the arrest of Defense Minister Jean Konan Banny, and the president had to intervene personally to pacify them.

For the next 27 years, almost all power in Ivory Coast was centered in Houphouët-Boigny. From 1965 to 1985, he was reelected unopposed to five successive five-year terms. Also every five years, a single list of PDCI candidates was returned to the National Assembly. For all intents and purposes, all of them were appointed by the president, since in his capacity as leader of the PDCI he approved all candidates. He and the PDCI believed that national unity and support for the PDCI were one and the same, and that a multiparty system would waste resources and harm the country&#x27;s unity. For this reason, all adult citizens were required to be members of the PDCI. The media were tightly controlled, and served mainly as outlets for government propaganda.

While Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s regime was authoritarian, it was much milder than had already became the norm for African regimes of the time. Once he had consolidated his power, he freed political prisoners in 1967. Under his &quot;unique brand of paternalistic authoritarianism&quot;, Houphouët-Boigny subdued dissent by offering government positions instead of incarceration to his critics. As a result, according to Robert Mundt, author of &quot;Côte d&#x27;Ivoire: Continuity and Change in a Semi-Democracy&quot;, he was never seriously challenged after 1963. While Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s Ivory Coast lacked political democracy in the Western sense, it was somewhat more tolerant and open than became the case in post-colonial Africa.

In order to foil any plans for a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, the president took control of the military and police, reducing their numbers from 5,300 to 3,500. Defence was entrusted to the French armed forces that, pursuant to the treaty on defence cooperation of 24 April 1961, were stationed at Port-Bouët and could intervene at Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s request or when they considered French interests to be threatened. They subsequently intervened during attempts by the Sanwi monarchists to secede in 1959 and 1969, and again in 1970, when an unauthorised political group, the Eburnian Movement, was formed and Houphouët-Boigny accused its leader Kragbé Gnagbé of wishing to secede.
Houphouët-Boigny married the much younger Marie-Thérèse Brou in 1952, having also divorced his first wife of twenty-two years earlier in 1952.
 The couple had no children of their own, but they adopted one child, Olivier Antoine, in 1981.

Hélène Houphouët-Boigny – Abla Pokou - was legally recognized in 1960 by her father Mister Felix Houphouët-Boigny who came to Court along with his three witnesses:
his sisters Ms Faitai and Adjoua Houphouët-Boigny and his cousin Yao Simon Yamoussoukro&#x27;s chief of Canton (Judgement Supplétif numsber1261 – 26 AOUT 1960 – Tribunal of Toumodi – A Court Session opened to the public).
Madame Helene Houphouët-Boigny is the granddaughter of the Bouale&#x27;s King Nanan Kouakou Anougble II, her Mother being Madame Akissi Anougble. They both died in 1958.

The marriage was not without scandal: in 1958, Marie-Thérèse went on a romantic escapade in Italy, while in 1961, Houphouët-Boigny fathered a child (Florence, d. 2007) out of wedlock by his mistress Henriette Duvignac.

===Leadership in Africa===
Following the example of de Gaulle, who refused proposals for an integrated Europe, Houphouët-Boigny opposed Nkrumah&#x27;s proposed United States of Africa, which called into question Ivory Coast&#x27;s recently acquired national sovereignty. However, Houphouët-Boigny was not opposed to collective African institutions if they were subject to his influence or control.

On 29 May 1959, in cooperation with Hamani Diori (Niger), Maurice Yaméogo (Upper Volta) and Hubert Maga (Dahomey), Houphouët-Boigny created the &quot;Conseil de l&#x27;Entente&quot; (&quot;Council of Accord or Council of Understanding&quot;). This regional organisation, founded in order to hamper the Mali Federation, was designed with three major functions: to allow shared management of certain public services, such as the port of Abidjan or the Abidjan–Niger railway line; to provide a solidarity fund accessible to member countries, 90% of which was provided by Ivory Coast; and to provide funding for various development projects through low-interest loans to member states (70% of the loans were supplied by Côte d&#x27;Ivoire). In 1966, Houphouët-Boigny even offered to grant dual citizenship to nationals from member countries of the Conseil de l&#x27;Entente, but the proposition was quickly abandoned following popular protests.

The ambitious Ivorian leader had even greater plans for French-speaking Africa: he intended to rally the different nations behind a large organisation whose objective was the mutual assistance of its member states. The project became a reality on 7 September 1961 with the signing of a charter giving birth to the &quot;Union africaine et malgache&quot; (UAM; &quot;African and Malagasy Union&quot;), comprising 12 French-speaking countries including Léopold Sédar Senghor&#x27;s Senegal. Agreements were signed in various sectors, such as economic, military and telecommunications, which strengthened solidarity among Francophone states. However, the creation of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in May 1963 affected his plans: the supporters of Pan-Africanism demanded the dissolution of all regional groupings, such as the UAM. Houphouët-Boigny reluctantly ceded, and transformed the UAM into the &quot;Organisation africaine et malgache de coopération économique et culturelle&quot; (&quot;African and Malagasy Organization of economic and cultural cooperation&quot;).

Considering the OAU a dead end organisation, particularly since Paris was opposed to the group, Houphouët-Boigny decided to create in 1965 &quot;l&#x27;Organisation commune africaine et malgache&quot; (OCAM; &quot;African and Malagasy Organization&quot;), a French organization in competition with the OAU. The organisation included among its members 16 countries, whose aim was to break revolutionary ambitions in Africa. However, over the years, the organisation became too subservient to France, resulting in the departure of half of the countries.

In the mid-1970s, during times of economic prosperity, Houphouët-Boigny and Senghor put aside their differences and joined forces to thwart Nigeria, which, in an attempt to establish itself in West Africa, had created the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The two countered the ECOWAS by creating the Economic Community of West Africa (ECWA), which superseded the old trade partnerships in the French-speaking regions. However, after assurances from Nigeria that ECOWAS would function in the same manner as the earlier Francophone organisations, Houphouët-Boigny and Senghor decided to merge their organization into ECOWAS in May 1975.

===&quot;Françafrique&quot;===
Throughout his presidency, Houphouët-Boigny surrounded himself with French advisers, such as Guy Nairay, chief of staff from 1960 to 1993, and Alain Belkiri, Secretary-General of the Ivorian government, whose influence extended to all areas. This type of diplomacy, which he labelled &quot;Françafrique&quot;, allowed him to maintain very close ties with the former colonial power, making Ivory Coast France&#x27;s primary African ally. Whenever one country would enter an agreement with an African nation, the other would unconditionally give its support. Through this arrangement, Houphouët-Boigny built a close friendship with Jacques Foccart, the chief adviser on African policy in the de Gaulle and Pompidou governments.

====Destabilization of revolutionary regimes====

By claiming independence for Guinea through the 28 September 1958 French constitutional referendum, Ahmed Sékou Touré had not only defied de Gaulle, but also his fellow African, Houphouët-Boigny. He distanced himself from Guinean officials in Conakry and the Guinean Democratic Party was excluded from the RDA. Tensions between Houphouët-Boigny and Touré also began to rise due to the conspiracies of the French intelligence agency SDECE against the Sékou Touré regime. In January 1960, Houphouët-Boigny delivered small arms to former rebels in Man, Ivory Coast and incited his council in 1965 to agree to taking part in an attempt to overthrow Sékou Touré. In 1967, he promoted the creation of the &quot;Front national de libération de la Guinée&quot; (FNLG; &quot;National Front for the Liberation of Guinea&quot;), a reserve of men ready to plot the downfall of Sékou Touré.

Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s relationship with Kwame Nkrumah, the leader of neighboring Ghana, degraded considerably following Guinea&#x27;s independence, due to Nkrumah&#x27;s financial and political support for Sékou Touré. After Sékou Touré convinced Nkrumah to support the secessionist Sanwi in Ivory Coast, Houphouët-Boigny began a campaign to discredit the Ghanaian regime. He accused Nkrumah of trying to destabilise Ivory Coast in 1963, and called for the Francophone states to boycott the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) conference scheduled to take place in Accra. Nkrumah was ousted from power in 1966 in a military coup; Houphouët-Boigny allowed the conspirators to use Ivory Coast as a base to coordinate the arrival and departure of their missions.

Also in collaboration with Foccart, Houphouët-Boigny took part in the attempted coup of 16 January 1977 led by famed French mercenary Bob Denard against the revolutionary regime of Mathieu Kérékou in Dahomey. Houphouët-Boigny, to fight against the Marxists in power in Angola, also lent his support to Jonas Savimbi&#x27;s UNITA party, whose feud with the MPLA party led to the Angolan Civil War.

Despite his reputation as a destabiliser of regimes, Houphouët-Boigny granted refuge to Jean-Bédel Bokassa, after the exiled Central African Republic dictator had been overthrown by French paratroopers in September 1979. This move was met with international criticism, and thus, having become a political and financial burden to Houphouët-Boigny, Bokassa was expelled from Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in 1983.

====Alignment with France====
Houphouët-Boigny was a participant in the November 1960 Congo Crisis, a period of political upheaval and conflict in Congo-Kinshasa. The Ivorian leader supported President Joseph Kasa-Vubu, an opponent of Lumumba, and followed France in supporting the controversial Congolese Prime Minister Moise Tshombe. Tshombe, disliked by much of Africa, was passionately defended by Houphouët-Boigny and was even invited into OCAM in May 1965. After the overthrow of Kasa-Vubu by General Mobutu in November 1965, the Ivorian president supported, in 1967, a plan proposed by the French secret service which aimed to bring the deposed Congolese leader back into power. The operation was a failure. In response, Houphouët-Boigny decided to boycott the fourth annual summit of the OAU held in September 1967 in Kinshasa.

Houphouët-Boigny was also a major contributor to the political tensions in Biafra. Considering Nigeria a potential danger to French-influenced African states, Foccart sent Houphouët-Boigny and Lieutenant-Colonel Raymond Bichelot on a mission in 1963 to monitor political developments in the country. The opportunity to weaken the former British colony presented itself in May 1967, when Biafra, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, undertook to secede from Nigeria. French-aligned African countries supported the secessionists who, provided with mercenaries and weapons by Jean Mauricheau-Beaupré, fought a civil war with the Nigerian government. By the end of the 1960s, French-supported nations suddenly and openly distanced themselves from France and Ivory Coast&#x27;s position on the civil war. Isolated on the international scene, both countries decided to suspend their assistance to Ojukwu, who eventually went into exile in Ivory Coast.

At the request of Paris, Houphouet-Boigny began forging relations with South Africa in October 1970, justifying his attitude by stating that &quot;[t]he problems of racial discrimination, so painful, so distressing, so revolting to our dignity of Negros, must not be resolved, we believe, by force.&quot; He even proposed to the OAU in June 1971 that they follow his lead. In spite of receiving some support, his proposal was rejected. This refusal did not, however, prevent him from continuing his attempts to approach the Pretoria regime. His attempts bore fruit in October of that year, when a semi-official meeting between a delegation of high level Ivorian officials and South African prime minister B. J. Vorster was held in the capital of South Africa. Moreover, mindful of the Communist influence in Africa, he met Vorster in Geneva in 1977, after the Soviet Union and Cuba tried to collectively spread their influence in Angola and Ethiopia. Relations with South Africa continued on an official basis until the end of his presidency.

Houphouët-Boigny and Thomas Sankara, the leader of Burkina Faso, had a highly turbulent relationship. Tensions reached their climax in 1985 when Ivory Coast Burkinabés accused authorities of being involved in a conspiracy to forcibly recruit young students to training camps in Libya. Houphouët-Boigny responded by inviting the dissident Jean-Claude Kamboulé to take refuge in
Côte d&#x27;Ivoire so that he could organise opposition to the Sankara regime. In 1987, Sankara was overthrown and assassinated in a coup. The coup may have had French involvement, since the Sankara regime had fallen into disfavour in France. Houphouët-Boigny was also suspected of involvement in the coup and in November, the PDCI asked the government to ban the sale of &quot;Jeune Afrique&quot; following its allegations of Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s participation. The Ivorian president would have greatly benefited from the divisions in the Burkina Faso government. He contacted Blaise Compaoré, the second-most powerful man in the regime; it is generally believed that they worked in conjunction with Laurent Dona Fologo, Robert Guéï and Pierre Ouédraogo to overthrow the Sankara regime.

Besides supporting policies pursued by France, Houphouët-Boigny also influenced their actions in Africa. He pushed France to support and provide arms to warlord Charles Taylor&#x27;s rebels during the First Liberian Civil War in hopes of receiving some of the country&#x27;s assets and resources after the war.

He secretly participated in the trafficking of arms to the South African segregationist regime at the time when it is engaged in a conflict in Angola.

===Opposition to the Soviet Union and China===
From the time of Ivory Coast&#x27;s independence, Houphouët-Boigny considered the Soviet Union and China &quot;malevolent&quot; influences on developing countries. He did not establish diplomatic relations with Moscow until 1967 and then severed them in 1969 following allegations of direct Soviet support to a 1968 student protest at the National University of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. The two countries did not restore ties until February 1986, by which time Houphouët-Boigny had embraced a more active foreign policy reflecting his quest for greater international recognition.

Houphouët-Boigny was even more outspoken in his criticism of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). He voiced fears of an &quot;invasion&quot; by the Chinese and a subsequent colonisation of Africa. He was especially concerned that Africans would see the problems of development in China as analogous to those of Africa, and see China&#x27;s solutions as appropriate to sub-Saharan Africa. Accordingly, Ivory Coast was one of the last countries to normalise relations with China, doing so on 3 March 1983. Under the principle demanded by Beijing for &quot;one China&quot;, the recognition by Côte d&#x27;Ivoire of the PRC effectively disestablished diplomatic relations between Abidjan and Taiwan.

===Economic policies in the 1960s and 1970s===
Houphouët-Boigny adopted a system of economic liberalism in Ivory Coast to obtain the trust and confidence of foreign investors, most notably the French. The advantages granted by the investment laws he established in 1959 allowed foreign business to repatriate up to 90% of their profits in their country of origin (the remaining 10% was reinvested in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire). He also developed an agenda for modernising the country&#x27;s infrastructure, for example, building an American-style business district in Abidjan where five-star hotels and resorts welcomed tourists and businessmen. Ivory Coast experienced economic growth of 11–12% from 1960 to 1965. The country&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) grew twelvefold between 1960 and 1978, from 145 to 1,750 billion CFA francs, while the trade balance continued to record a surplus.

The origin of this economic success stemmed from the president&#x27;s decision to focus on the primary sector of the economy, rather than the secondary sector. As a result, the agricultural sector experienced significant development: between 1960 and 1970, cocoa cultivators tripled their production to 312,000 tonnes and coffee production rose by nearly 50%, from 185,500 to 275,000 tonnes. As a result of this economic prosperity, Ivory Coast saw an influx of immigrants from other West African countries; the foreign workforce—mostly Burkinabés—who maintained indigenous plantations, represented over a quarter of the Ivorian population by 1980. Both Ivorians and foreigners began referring to Houphouët-Boigny as the &quot;Sage of Africa&quot; for performing what became known as &quot;Ivorian miracle&quot;. He was also respectfully nicknamed &quot;The Old One&quot; (&quot;Le Vieux&quot;).

However, the economic system developed in cooperation with France was far from perfect. As Houphouët-Boigny described it, the economy of Ivory Coast experienced &quot;growth without development&quot;. The growth of the economy depended on capital, initiatives and a financial framework from investors abroad; it had not become independent or self-sustaining.

===Crisis in Ivory Coast===

====Economy on the brink of collapse====

Beginning in 1978, the economy of Ivory Coast experienced a serious decline due to the sharp downturn in international market prices of coffee and cocoa. The decline was perceived as fleeting, since its impact on planters was buffered by the Caistab, the agricultural marketing board, which ensured them a livable income. The next year, in order to contain a sudden drop in the prices of exported goods, Houphouët-Boigny raised prices to resist international tariffs on raw materials. However, by applying only this solution, Ivory Coast lost more than 700 billion CFA francs between 1980 and 1982. From 1983 to 1984, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire fell victim to a drought that ravaged nearly 400,000 hectares of forest and 250,000 hectares of coffee and cocoa plants. To address this problem, Houphouët-Boigny travelled to London to negotiate an agreement on coffee and cocoa prices with traders and industrialists; by 1984, the agreement had fallen apart and Ivory Coast was engulfed in a major financial crisis.

Even the production of the offshore oil drilling and petrochemical industries, developed to supply the Caistab, was affected by the 1986 worldwide economic recession. Ivory Coast, which had bought planters&#x27; harvests for double the market price, fell into heavy debt. By May 1987, the foreign debt had reached US$10 billion, prompting Houphouët-Boigny to suspend payments of the debt. Refusing to sell off its supply of cocoa, the country shut down its exports in July and forced world rates to increase. However, this &quot;embargo&quot; failed. In November 1989, Houphouët-Boigny liquidated his enormous stock of cocoa to big businesses to jump-start the economy. Gravely ill at this time, he named a prime minister (the post was unoccupied since 1960), Alassane Ouattara, who established a series of belt-tightening economic measures to bring the country out of debt.

====Social tensions====
The general atmosphere of enrichment and satisfaction during the period of economic growth in Ivory Coast made it possible for Houphouët-Boigny to maintain and control internal political tensions. His easygoing authoritarian regime, where political prisoners were almost nonexistent, was well accepted by the population. However, the economic crisis that began in the 1980s caused a sharp decline in living conditions for the middle class and underprivileged urban populations. According to the World Bank, the population living below the poverty threshold went from 11% in 1985 to 31% by 1993. Despite the implementation of certain measures, such as the reduction of the number of young French workers (who worked abroad while serving in the military) from 3,000 to 2,000 in 1986, allowing many jobs to go to young Ivorian graduates, the government failed to control the rising rates of unemployment and bankruptcy in many companies.

Strong social agitations shook the country, creating insecurity. The army mutinied in 1990 and 1992, and on 2 March 1990, protesters organized mass demonstrations in the streets of Abidjan with slogans such as &quot;thief Houphouët&quot; and &quot;corrupt Houphouët&quot;. These popular demonstrations prompted the president to launch a system of democratization on 31 May, in which he authorised political pluralism and trade unions.

=====Opposition=====

Laurent Gbagbo gained recognition as one of the principal instigators of the student demonstrations during the protests against Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s government on 9 February 1982, which led to the closing of the universities and other educational institutions. Shortly thereafter, his wife and he formed what would become the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI). Gbagbo went into exile in France later that year, where he promoted the FPI and its political platforms. Although the FPI was ideologically similar to the Unified Socialist Party, the French socialist government tried to ignore Gbagbo&#x27;s party to please Houphouët-Boigny. After a lengthy appeal process, Gbagbo obtained status as a political refugee in France in 1985. However, the French government attempted to pressure him into returning to Ivory Coast, as Houphouët-Boigny had begun to worry about Gbagbo&#x27;s developing a network of contacts, and believed &quot;his stirring opponent would be less of a threat in Abidjan than in Paris&quot;.

In 1988, Gbagbo returned from exile to Ivory Coast after Houphouët-Boigny implicitly granted him forgiveness by declaring that &quot;the tree did not get angry at the bird&quot;. In 1990, Houphouët-Boigny legalised opposition parties. On 28 October a presidential election was held. Gbagbo filed to run against Houphouët-Boigny, resulting in the country&#x27;s first contested election. Gbagbo highlighted the President&#x27;s age, suggesting that the 85-year-old president would not survive a seventh five-year term. Houphouët-Boigny countered by broadcasting television footage of his youth. According to official figures, he defeated Gbagbo with 2,445,365 votes to 548,441—an implausible 81.7 percent of the vote.

====Displays of wealth====
During his presidency, Houphouët-Boigny benefited greatly from the wealth of Ivory Coast; by the time of his death in 1993, his personal wealth was estimated to be between US$7 and $11 billion. With regards to his large fortune, Houphouët-Boigny said in 1983, &quot;People are surprised that I like gold. It&#x27;s just that I was born in it.&quot; The Ivorian leader acquired a dozen properties in the metropolitan area of Paris (including Hotel Masseran on Masseran Street in the 7th arrondissement of Paris), a property in Castel Gandolfo in Italy, and a house in Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland. He owned real estate companies, such as Grand Air SI, SI Picallpoc and Interfalco, and had many shares in prestigious jewelry and watchmaking companies, such as Piaget SA and Harry Winston. He placed his fortune in Switzerland, once asking if &quot;there is any serious man on Earth not stocking parts of his fortune in Switzerland&quot;.

In 1983, Houphouët-Boigny moved the capital from Abidjan to Yamoussoukro. There, at the expense of the state, he built many buildings such as the Institute Polytechnique and an international airport. The most luxurious project was the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, which is currently the largest church in the world, with an area of and a height of . Personally financed by Houphouët-Boigny, construction for the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace was carried out by the Lebanese architect Pierre Fakhoury at a total cost of about US$150–200 million. Houphouët-Boigny offered it to Pope John Paul II as a &quot;personal gift&quot;; the latter, after having unsuccessfully requested it being shorter than St. Peter&#x27;s in Rome, consecrated it all the same on 10 September 1990. Due to a collapse of the national economy coupled with lavish amounts spent on its construction, the Basilica was criticized: it was called &quot;the basilica in the bush&quot; by several western news agencies.

==Death and legacy==

===Succession and death===
The political, social, and economic crises also touched the issue of who would succeed Houphouët-Boigny as head of state. After severing ties with his former political heir Philippe Yacé in 1980, who, as president of the National Assembly, was entitled to exercise the full functions of president of the republic if the head of state was incapacitated or absent, Houphouët-Boigny delayed as much as he could in officially designating a successor. The president&#x27;s health became increasingly fragile, with Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara administering the country from 1990 onwards, while the president was hospitalised in France. There was a struggle for power, which ended when Houphouët-Boigny rejected Ouattara in favour of Henri Konan Bédié, the president of the National Assembly. In December 1993, Houphouët-Boigny, terminally ill with prostate cancer, was urgently flown back to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire so he could die there. He was kept on life support to ensure that the last dispositions concerning his succession were defined. After his family consented, Houphouët-Boigny was disconnected from life support at 6:35 am GMT on 7 December. At the time of his death, Houphouët-Boigny was the longest-serving leader in Africa and the third in the world, after Fidel Castro of Cuba and Kim Il Sung of North Korea.

Houphouët-Boigny left no written will or legacy report for Côte d&#x27;Ivoire upon his death in 1993. His recognised heirs, especially Helena, led a battle against the government to recover part of the vast fortune Houphouët-Boigny had left, which she claimed was &quot;private&quot; and did not belong to the State.

===Funeral===

Following Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s death, the country&#x27;s stability was maintained, as seen by his funeral on 7 February 1994. The funeral for this &quot; of francophone Africa&quot; was held in the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, with 7,000 guests inside the building and tens of thousands outside. The two-month delay before Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s funeral, common among members of the Baoule ethnic group, allowed for many ceremonies preceding his burial. The president&#x27;s funeral featured many traditional African funerary customs, including a large chorus dressed in bright batik dresses singing &quot;laagoh budji gnia&quot; (Baoulé: &quot;Lord, it is you who has made all things&quot;) and village chiefs displaying strips of kente and korhogo cloth. Baoulés are traditionally buried with objects they enjoyed while alive; Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s family, however, did not state what, if anything, they would bury with him.

Over 140 countries and international organisations sent delegates to the funeral. However, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, many Ivorians were disappointed by the poor attendance of several key allies, most notably the United States. The small United States delegation was led by Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O&#x27;Leary and Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs George Moose. In contrast, Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s close personal ties with France were reflected in the large French delegation, which included President François Mitterrand; Prime Minister Édouard Balladur; the presidents of the National Assembly and of the Senate, Philippe Séguin and René Monory; former president Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing; Jacques Chirac; his friend Jacques Foccart; and six former prime ministers. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s death is not only the end of a political era here, but perhaps as well the end of the close French-African relationship that he came to symbolize.&quot;

===Félix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize===
To establish his legacy as a man of peace, Houphouët-Boigny created an award in 1989, sponsored by UNESCO and funded entirely by extra-budgetary resources provided by the Félix-Houphouët-Boigny Foundation, to honor those who search for peace. The prize is &quot;named after President Félix Houphouët-Boigny, the doyen of African Heads of State and a tireless advocate of peace, concord, fellowship and dialogue to solve all conflicts both within and between States&quot;. It is awarded annually along with a check for €122,000, by an international jury composed of 11 persons from five continents, led by former United States secretary of state and Nobel Peace Prize winner Henry Kissinger. The prize was first awarded in 1991 to Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, and Frederik Willem de Klerk, president of the Republic of South Africa, and has been awarded each year since, with the exception of 2001 and 2004.

<text>Amistad is a 1997 American historical drama film directed by Steven Spielberg, based on the events in 1839 aboard the Spanish slave ship &quot;La Amistad&quot;, during which Mende tribesmen abducted for the slave trade managed to gain control of their captors&#x27; ship off the coast of Cuba, and the international legal battle that followed their capture by the &quot;Washington&quot;, a U.S. revenue cutter. The case was ultimately resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1841.

Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, and Matthew McConaughey starred, along with Djimon Hounsou in his breakout role as Cinqué; Pete Postlethwaite, Nigel Hawthorne, and a then unknown Chiwetel Ejiofor appeared in supporting roles.

The film received largely positive critical reviews and grossed over $58 million worldwide.

==Plot==

The schooner &quot;La Amistad&quot; is transporting black slaves off the coast of the Spanish colony of Cuba in 1839. A captive, Cinqué, leads an uprising against the crew, most of whom are killed. Two navigators, Pedro Montes and Jose Ruiz, are spared on condition they help sail the ship to Africa. The Spaniards betray them and instead sail into U.S. waters, where the ship is stopped by the U.S. revenue cutter &quot;Washington&quot;, and the mutineers are arrested.

A complicated legal battle ensues over the slaves. United States Attorney William S. Holabird brings charges of piracy and murder against them. Those charges are dismissed in a criminal case because the killings occurred outside of United States territorial waters.

A civil case then follows, with the Amistad Africans being claimed as property by Montes and Ruiz, and as salvage by two officers from the &quot;Washington&quot;. The Spanish government of Queen Isabella II intervenes in support of Montes and Ruiz, under the Treaty of 1795, also known as Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty. To avoid a diplomatic incident, President Martin Van Buren directs his Secretary of State John Forsyth to support the Spanish claim. Meanwhile, abolitionist Lewis Tappan and his black associate Theodore Joadson (a former slave), resolve to help the captives. They approach the brilliant lawyer, former U.S. president and serving U.S. representative John Quincy Adams, but he is reluctant to get involved. They instead hire the young and eccentric attorney Roger Sherman Baldwin.

Baldwin, unable to converse directly with his clients due to the language barrier, suspects the slaves are not Cubans but Africans who have been kidnapped and transported illegally as part of the banned transatlantic slave trade. He and Joadson search &quot;La Amistad&quot; and find documents which prove the captives were kidnapped from Sierra Leone and transported across the Atlantic aboard the Portuguese slave ship &quot;Tecora&quot; before being transferred to &quot;La Amistad&quot; in Havana. The judge is impressed and signals his intention to dismiss the U.S. and Spanish governments&#x27; case and release the captives.

To preclude this possibility, Van Buren replaces the judge with a younger man, Coglin, who he believes will be easier to manipulate. Joadson seeks advice from Adams, who tells him that court cases are usually won by the side with the best &#x27;story&#x27;. Baldwin and Joadson recruit freedman James Covey as a translator, enabling Cinqué to testify directly before the court. He describes how he was kidnapped from his home, and the horrors of the Middle Passage. Baldwin calls Captain Charles Fitzgerald of the Royal Navy&#x27;s West Africa Squadron to corroborate Cinqué&#x27;s testimony. He speculates that the captives were taken aboard the &quot;Tecora&quot; at the notorious slave fort Lomboko. Under cross-examination, Fitzgerald admits there is no direct evidence of Lomboko&#x27;s existence. As tension rises, Cinqué abruptly stands and demands, &quot;Give us, us free!&quot;. Moved by Cinqué&#x27;s emotion, Judge Coglin rules that the Africans are to be released, and that Montes and Ruiz are to be arrested and charged with illegal slave-trading.

Under pressure from Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, who represents the slave-holding interests of the American South, Van Buren appeals the case to the Supreme Court. Baldwin and Joadson visit Adams again, and after meeting Cinqué he agrees to represent the Africans before the Supreme Court. Adams&#x27; impassioned and eloquent speech convinces the court to confirm the judgement and release the Africans.

Lomboko is stormed by Royal Marines led by Fitzgerald, and the slaves held there are freed. Fitzgerald orders the ship&#x27;s cannon to destroy the fortress, and dictates a sardonic letter to Forsyth saying that he was correct — the infamous slave fort does not (now) exist.

Van Buren is discredited by his failure to prevent the release of the Africans, and loses the 1840 election to William Henry Harrison. The Spanish government continues to press its claim for compensation up until the American Civil War.

The captions say that Cinqué returns to Africa, but is unable to reunite with his family due to civil war in Sierra Leone.

===Casting===
In casting the role of Joseph Cinqué, Spielberg had strict requirements that the actor must have an impressive physical appearance, be able to command authority and be of West African descent. The actor who secured the role would also need to learn the Mende accent spoken by Cinqué. Cuba Gooding Jr. was offered the role but turned it down and later regretted it. Dustin Hoffman was offered a role but turned it down, while Will Smith and musician Seal both tried to secure the part. Despite open auditions being held in London, Paris and Sierra Leone, the role remained unfilled with just nine weeks before filming was due to start. Spielberg was prepared to delay production by up to two years if he could not find the right actor. After considering over 150 actors, Spielberg watched the audition tape of relatively unknown actor Djimon Hounsou reading a speech from the film&#x27;s script. After Hounsou read the speech in English and further learned it in Mende, Spielberg was impressed enough to cast him in the role of Cinqué. Hounsou auditioned with the hope of landing just a small role and said he was not aware of the story before securing the role. He read numerous books on the rebellion and subsequent trial to acquaint himself with events portrayed in the film.

Morgan Freeman was selected for the role of Theodore Joadson on a first-come basis; Joadson was a fictional character in the film representing the composite of African American abolitionists in the 19th century. The actor and film director Spike Lee was reportedly offered the role but declined it. Freeman had been offered the role of Ensign James Covey, but he chose to play Joadson instead after he realized that Covey was too young for him. Chiwetel Ejiofor made his film debut as Covey, having auditioned for it while playing Othello at the Royal National Theatre in London while he was still a student at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.

Retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun made a cameo appearance in the film as Justice Joseph Story. Blackmun was honored to appear in the movie, acknowledging it was a &quot;significant film about our nation&#x27;s struggle with slavery&quot;.

==Production==
Djimon Hounsou had just 10 days to learn the Mende language for his role as Joseph Cinqué; despite both Mende and Hounsou&#x27;s native Gun language being from West Africa, there were few similarities. Hounsou struggled to learn all his lines in Mende and resorted to phonetically reciting some of them, except for the most important scenes where he made sure to understand every word spoken. Hounsou expressed that being restrained in real chains and shackles during filming was among the most challenging aspects of the movie, causing him to contemplate quitting on the first day.

===Filming===
Filming locations included Mystic Seaport, which doubled as New Haven. Film crews spent four days there and employed around 300 extras Numerous scenes were filmed in Newport, Rhode Island. Many courthouse scenes were shot in the Old Colony House, while the prison scenes were shot within Fort Adams.

During the scene where the characters Joseph Cinqué and John Quincy Adams meet for the first time, actors Hounsou and Anthony Hopkins &quot;struggled through take after take, trying not to cry&quot;, and had to be continually told by Steven Spielberg to hold back the tears as it wasn&#x27;t appropriate for that moment in the scene. Hopkins reportedly wept once the scene was completed.

===Post-production===
The entire film was completed in 51 days and cost around $39 million (~$ in ).

Prior to release, a legal battle ensued between Spielberg&#x27;s DreamWorks Pictures and novelist Barbara Chase-Riboud; the latter claiming that specific details from her 1989 novel &quot;Echo of Lions&quot; were lifted for the screenplay. Chase-Riboud filed a $10 million lawsuit of copyright infringement.

==Soundtrack==
===Music===

The musical score for &quot;Amistad&quot; was composed by John Williams. A soundtrack album was released on December 9, 1997, by DreamWorks Records.

==Historical accuracy==
Professor Howard Jones&#x27;s 1987 book &quot;Mutiny on the Amistad: The Saga of a Slave Revolt and Its Impact on American Abolition, Law, and Diplomacy&quot; was cited by the producers as one of numerous sources used for research during the script&#x27;s development.

Many academics, including Columbia University professor Eric Foner, have criticized &quot;Amistad&quot; for the misleading characterization of the &quot;Amistad&quot; case as a &quot;turning point&quot; in American views on slavery, writing that:

Elmer P. Martin Jr. argued that the film missed an opportunity to mention contemporary events like the &quot;Creole&quot; case, a similar slave revolt on an American ship in 1841. Martin noted that some antebellum abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass found it &quot;strange and perverse&quot; that some of the defenders of the &quot;Amistad&quot; slaves were willing to excuse the &quot;similar traffic carried on with the same motives and purposes&quot; in American waters.

Some critics, like historian Eric McKitrick, felt that the fictional character of Joadson, as portrayed by Morgan Freeman, softened the film&#x27;s portrayal of contemporary American race relations: &quot;No such person of the bearing and dignity depicted by Mr. Freeman would have been allowed to exist in the America of 1840.&quot; However, Richard S. Newman drew a connection between Joadson and Black reformers like James Forten, an early abolitionist who influenced white reformers like Tappan and William Lloyd Garrison.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Amistad&quot; received mainly positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 78% based on reviews from 67 critics, with an average score of 6.9/10. Its consensus reads, &quot;Heartfelt without resorting to preachiness, &quot;Amistad&quot; tells an important story with engaging sensitivity and absorbing skill.&quot; Metacritic calculated an average score of 63 out of 100 based on 23 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Susan Wloszczyna of &quot;USA Today&quot; summed up the feelings of many reviewers when she wrote, &quot;as Spielberg vehicles go, &quot;Amistad&quot; — part mystery, action thriller, courtroom drama, even culture-clash comedy — lands between the disturbing lyricism of &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; and the storybook artificiality of &quot;The Color Purple&quot;.&quot; Roger Ebert awarded the film three out of four stars, writing: 
In 2014, the movie was one of several discussed by Noah Berlatsky in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in an article concerning white savior narratives in film, calling it &quot;sanctimonious drivel.&quot;

Morgan Freeman is very proud of the movie, having said, &quot;I loved the film. I really did. I had a moment of err, during the killings. I thought that was a little over-wrought. But [Spielberg] wanted to make a point and I understood that.&quot;

===Box office===
The film debuted at 3 on Wednesday, December 10, 1997. It earned $44,229,441 at the box office in the United States.

===Awards and honors===
&quot;Amistad&quot; was nominated for Academy Awards in four categories: Best Supporting Actor (Anthony Hopkins), Best Original Dramatic Score (John Williams), Best Cinematography (Janusz Kamiński), and Best Costume Design (Ruth E. Carter).
=== Other cultural significance ===
The United States Department of State and the Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos (ICAIC) collaborated in 1998 to screen Amistad as part of an effort to increase &quot;cultural diplomacy&quot; built around shared national histories of racial struggles in the United States and Cuba.

<doc id="418112" wikidata="Q357779" url="?curid=418112" title="Henri Konan Bédié">
<text>Aimé Henri Konan Bédié (5 May 1934 – 1 August 2023) was an Ivorian politician. He was President of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire from 1993 to 1999, and formerly President of the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast – African Democratic Rally (PDCI-RDA). Prior to becoming president, he was a member and president of the National Assembly of Ivory Coast. He unsuccessfully sought another term as president in the 2020 presidential election.

==Early life==
Aimé Henri Konan Bédié was born in Dadiékro, Daoukro Department, on 5 May 1934. He attended school in France. Bédié married the former Henriette Koizan Bomo in 1957. The couple had four children.

==Career==
After studying in France, he became Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&#x27;s first ambassador to the United States and Canada following independence in 1960, and from 1966 to 1977, he served in the government as Minister of Economy and Finance. While serving as Finance Minister, Bédié became the first Chairman of the IMF and World Bank&#x27;s joint Development Committee, holding that post from 1974 to 1976. He was Special Advisor to the World Bank Group&#x27;s International Finance Corporation from 1978 to 1980.

In 1980, Bédié was elected to the National Assembly of Ivory Coast, and he was then elected as President of the National Assembly in December 1980. He was re-elected as President of the National Assembly in 1985 and 1990.

==Presidency (1993–1999)==
As National Assembly President, Bédié stood first in the line of succession to long-time President Félix Houphouët-Boigny. He announced that he was assuming the presidency on state television a few hours after Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s death on 7 December 1993. A brief power struggle between Bédié and Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara ensued; Bédié was successful and Ouattara resigned as Prime Minister on 9 December. Bédié was subsequently elected as President of the PDCI in April 1994. Per the Constitution, he served as acting president for the balance of Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s seventh term.

As President, Bédié encouraged national stability but was accused of political repression and stratospheric levels of corruption. In the October 1995 presidential election, the electoral code was amended to require presidential candidates to have been born of two Ivorian parents and have resided in the country for five years prior to the election. These provisions were thought to have been aimed at Ouattara. He had resided in the United States since 1990 while serving as deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and his father was rumored to be Burkinabe. The two main opposition parties, Ouattara&#x27;s Rally of the Republicans (RDR) and the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI), decided to boycott the election, and Bédié won the election with 96% of the vote.

Bédié was overthrown in a military coup on 24 December 1999, after he rejected the demands of soldiers who rebelled on 23 December; one of these demands was for the release of members of the RDR. Retired general Robert Guéï became president. Bédié fled to a French military base before leaving Côte d&#x27;Ivoire by helicopter on 26 December and going to Togo, along with family members. Upon his arrival at the airport in Lomé, he was greeted by Togolese President Gnassingbé Eyadéma.

==Post-presidency==
Bédié departed Togo on 3 January 2000 and went to Paris. The PDCI announced in early 2000 that it would hold a congress to choose new leadership, and Bédié denounced this as a &quot;putsch&quot;; the party decided to retain Bédié in the leadership, however. An international arrest warrant for Bédié and Niamien N&#x27;Goran, who had served under Bédié as Finance Minister, was issued in early June 2000 for alleged theft of public funds. Speaking on French television, Bédié said that he was not worried that he might be returned to Ivory Coast to face trial at the hands of a government that he deemed illegal, expressing his &quot;faith in the law of France&quot;.

Bédié registered as a candidate in the October 2000 presidential election, although Emile Constant Bombet, who had served as Interior Minister under Bédié, defeated him for the PDCI presidential nomination in August. Bédié was barred from running by the Constitutional Court, along with Bombet, and on 10 October Bédié called for a boycott of the election.

On 23 June 2001, Laurent Gbagbo, who had been elected President in the 2000 election, met with Bédié in Paris and urged him to return to Ivory Coast. He eventually returned on 15 October 2001. A few days later, the 11th Ordinary Congress of the PDCI was postponed indefinitely at his request.

Bédié spoke at a national reconciliation forum on 12 November 2001. He attributed the country&#x27;s political crisis to the December 1999 coup and he urged all Ivorian politicians to denounce the coup. He also said that the nationalistic concept of &quot;Ivoirité&quot;, which was promoted during his presidency, was an attempt to bolster &quot;cultural identity&quot; and not a means of political exclusion. According to critics of &quot;Ivoriité&quot;, it was divisive, xenophobic, and intended to eliminate political competition from Ouattara—who was claimed to be the son of Burkinabé parents—but Bédié rejected this criticism. When the PDCI Congress was eventually held in April 2002, Bédié defeated Laurent Dona Fologo for the party leadership; he received 82% of the vote.

Bédié later spent another year in France, returning to Ivory Coast on 11 September 2005. Upon his return, he said that President Gbagbo should not remain in office after the end of his term in October 2005 and that a transitional government should be installed.
In an interview with Agence France Presse on 20 May 2007, Bédié said that he would be the PDCI candidate in the next presidential election, which was then expected to be held in 2008.

Bédié addressed a rally in Dabou on 22 September 2007, in which he declared the need for a &quot;shock treatment&quot; to return the country to normal, promised to restore the economy, and strongly criticized Gbagbo.

In June 2020, Bédié announced that he would run in the October presidential election on behalf of the Democratic Party of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. He came in third place, winning 1.68% of the vote.

Bédié died on 1 August 2023 at a private hospital in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, at the age of 89.

In the early 1960s, Woolery sang and played the double bass with a folk song trio called The Bordermen. He also sang in a duo called The Avant-Garde who were in the psychedelic pop genre. The other half of the duo was Bubba Fowler. They signed to Columbia Records and had a Top 40 hit with &quot;Naturally Stoned&quot; in 1968, bringing the duo one-hit wonder status. It reached #30 in Canada, October 21, 1968.

In the late 1970s, Woolery returned to his singing career. Woolery charted on Hot Country Songs with &quot;Painted Lady&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Love Affair&quot;. Between 1977 and 1980, Woolery recorded for Warner Bros. Records and Epic Records as a solo artist, with two low-charting singles on Hot Country Songs. Woolery also co-wrote &quot;The Joys of Being a Woman&quot; on Tammy Wynette&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;We Sure Can Love Each Other&quot;.

===Acting and television show host===
As an actor, Woolery appeared with Stephen Boyd, Rosey Grier, and Cheryl Ladd in the mid-1970s film &quot;The Treasure of Jamaica Reef&quot;.

Woolery performed as Mr. Dingle on the children&#x27;s television series &quot;New Zoo Revue&quot; in the early 1970s. During that time, he made his first game show appearance on an episode of &quot;Tattletales&quot; in 1974, alongside then-wife Jo Ann Pflug. Starting as a singer, Woolery appeared on an episode of &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;. On January 6, 1975, he began hosting &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; at the suggestion of creator Merv Griffin, who had seen Woolery sing on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Woolery hosted the show for six years, and in 1978 was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host or Hostess in a Game or Audience Participation Show. In 1981, he was involved in a salary dispute with the program&#x27;s producers; he said in a 2007 interview that he demanded a raise from $65,000 a year to about $500,000 a year because the program was drawing a 44 viewership share at the time, and other hosts (such as Richard Dawson and Bob Barker) were making that much. Griffin offered Woolery $400,000 a year, and NBC offered to pay the additional $100,000, but after Griffin threatened to move the program to CBS, NBC withdrew the offer. Woolery&#x27;s contract was not renewed and his final episode aired on December 25, 1981. Pat Sajak replaced him.

Woolery hosted &quot;Love Connection&quot; (1983–1994), &quot;The Big Spin&quot; (1985), &quot;Scrabble&quot; (1984–1990, 1993), &quot;Home &amp; Family&quot; (1996–1998, co-host), &quot;The Dating Game&quot; (1997–1999), &quot;Greed&quot; (1999–2000), &quot;TV Land Ultimate Fan Search&quot; (1999–2000), and &quot;Lingo&quot; (2002–2007). In addition, he was the subject of a short-lived reality television, &quot;Chuck Woolery: Naturally Stoned&quot; (originally titled &quot;Chuck Woolery: Behind the Lingo&quot;) in 2003. He also hosted his own talk show, &quot;The Chuck Woolery Show&quot;, which lasted for only a few months in 1991. He hosted &quot;The Price Is Right Live!&quot; at Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment casinos, and appeared in the live stage show &quot;$250,000 Game Show Spectacular&quot; at the Westgate Las Vegas until April 2008.

On April 21, 2023, it was announced that Woolery would be featured in an upcoming four-episode documentary by ABC News titled &quot;The Game Show Show&quot;, covering the history of game shows in America over the last eight decades. The four-part documentary premiered on May 10, 2023. Woolery later hosted &quot;″80s Quiz Show&quot;, a game show based on trends and norms of the 1980s, which streamed on Fox Nation on June 7, 2024.

===Radio and podcast host===
From 2012 to 2014, Woolery hosted a nationally syndicated radio commentary show, &quot;Save Us Chuck Woolery&quot;, which grew out of his YouTube videos. In 2014, the show became a long-format podcast, and was retitled &quot;Blunt Force Truth&quot;. However, before his death the show could still be heard on about 60 radio stations across the country. With co-host Mark Young, Woolery expanded on his conservative political ideals and current events, often inviting guest experts to join the conversation.

==Political views==
Woolery spoke in favor of American conservatism. He was an active supporter of the Republican Party, and had mainly donated to Republican and conservative causes. He was a gun rights activist.

Woolery was accused of antisemitism after a series of tweets in May 2017, including this message: &quot;Believe it or not. Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin were both Jewish. I was shocked to find, most of the original Soviet Communists were Jewish.&quot; The claim that communism is Jewish in origin forms the core of the antisemitic trope called Judeo-Bolshevism. The tweet led to accusations of antisemitism against Woolery. In response to the criticism, Woolery tweeted: &quot;Amazing to me, I point out that Marx and Lenin were Jewish, Fact of history, and now I&#x27;m being called anti-Semitic? Why do people do this?&quot;

On July 12, 2020, Woolery tweeted that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), doctors, the media, and Democratic Party were lying about the COVID-19 pandemic. President Donald Trump retweeted Woolery&#x27;s claims. The following day, Woolery tweeted that his son had tested positive for the virus and that the &quot;COVID-19 pandemic is real&quot;. His Twitter account was later made private before later being made public again.

==Personal life and death==
Woolery was a Christian who volunteered in ministry. He was married five times and was the father of five children. Woolery and his first wife, Margaret Hays, had two children together, Katherine and Chad. Chad was killed in a motorcycle accident in January 1986. In 1972, he married actress Jo Ann Pflug and had a daughter, Melissa. They divorced in 1980. With third wife Teri Nelson, who is the adopted daughter of actor David Nelson and granddaughter of Ozzie and Harriet Nelson, he had two sons, Michael and Sean. In 2006, he married Kim Barnes. At the time of his death, it was reported that he was married to a woman named Kristen.

In Woolery&#x27;s later years, he lived in Horseshoe Bay, Texas, and died at home on November 23, 2024, at the age of 83.

<doc id="418114" wikidata="Q621510" url="?curid=418114" title="Max Valier">
<text>Max Valier (9 February 1895 – 17 May 1930) was an Austrian rocketry pioneer. He was a leading figure in the world&#x27;s first large-scale rocket program, Opel-RAK, and helped found the German &quot;Verein für Raumschiffahrt&quot; (VfR – &quot;Spaceflight Society&quot;) that would bring together many of the minds that would later make spaceflight a reality in the 20th century.

==Biography==
Valier was born in Bozen in the County of Tyrol (now South Tyrol) and in 1913 enrolled to study physics at the University of Innsbruck. He also trained as a machinist at a nearby factory. His studies were interrupted by the First World War, during which he served in the Austro-Hungarian army&#x27;s air corps as an aerial observer.

After the war, Valier did not return to his studies, but became a freelance science writer. In 1923, he read Hermann Oberth&#x27;s landmark book &quot;Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen&quot; (&quot;The Rocket into Interplanetary Space&quot;) and was inspired to write a similar work to explain Oberth&#x27;s ideas in terms that could be understood by lay persons. With Oberth&#x27;s assistance, he published &quot;Der Vorstoß in den Weltenraum&quot; (&quot;The Advance into Space&quot;) the following year. It was an outstanding success, going through six editions before 1930. He followed this with numerous articles on the subject of space travel, with titles like &quot;Berlin to New York in One Hour&quot; and &quot;A Daring Trip to Mars&quot;.
In 1928 and 1929, he worked with Fritz von Opel on a number of rocket-powered cars and aircraft within the world&#x27;s first large-scale rocket program Opel-RAK. For von Opel, these experimentations had also a very positive public relations effect for the Opel company, and for Valier, they were a way of further raising interest in rocketry amongst the general population. Friedrich Sander in these endeavours was chosen as the supplier of solid-fuel rocket motors. Valier&#x27;s and von Opel&#x27;s activities led to land and rail vehicle speed records, and eventually to the world&#x27;s first rocket plane. The first public flight took place on September 30, 1929, piloted by von Opel. After the Opel RAK.1 flight, caused by the Great Depression, the Opel RAK collaboration came to an end, von Opel left Germany in 1930, immigrated to the US and eventually to France and Switzerland. Valier then continued the rocket development on his own.

By the late 1920s, the VfR was focusing its efforts on liquid-fuelled rockets. Their first successful test firing with liquid fuel (five minutes) occurred in the Heylandt plant on 25 January 1930. On 19 April 1930 Valier performed the first test drive of a rocket car with liquid propulsion, the &quot;Valier-Heylandt Rak 7&quot;.

Valier was killed less than a month later when an alcohol-fuelled rocket exploded on his test bench in Berlin. His protégé Arthur Rudolph went on to develop an improved and safer version of Valier&#x27;s engine.

==Memorials==
Max Valier is still remembered in South Tyrol as one of the most famous inventors and scientists of this province, and a number of institutions bear his name:

*The South-Tyrolean amateur astronomy society &quot;Amateurastronomen Max Valier&quot; and their public astronomical observatory &quot;Max Valier&quot; in Gummer (BZ Italy)
*The Technological Institute &quot;Max Valier&quot; in Bolzano, Italy
*The Max Valier X-ray telescopic satellite launched in 2017 orbits the Earth transmitting Morse Code on 145.96 MHz and 437.325 MHz.

<doc id="418116" wikidata="Q1917681" url="?curid=418116" title="Wolseley, Saskatchewan">
<text>Wolseley (Canada 2011 Census population 864) is a town in southeast Saskatchewan, Canada, approximately east of Regina on the Trans-Canada Highway.

==History==

Wolseley&#x27;s Provincial Court House building was constructed in 1893, and is the oldest surviving court house building in the province. The Town Hall and Opera House, built in 1906, is a classic building and is used for many community events. Canada&#x27;s first Beaver Lumber was opened in Wolseley by co-founder E. A. Banbury in 1883. Beaver Lumber is now protected by Heritage status. The Banbury House Inn, which was originally built in 1905 as the private home for E. A. Banbury, was moved from its original location on the north bank of Fairly Lake to the west end of Wolseley to allow expansion of Lakeside Care Home in the 1980s. The Banbury House Inn now serves as a bed and breakfast.

Two private residences are also on the Canadian List of Historic Places. The Perley Residence, located at 206 Front Street, is a two-storey brick house which was the home of several prominent Wolseley residents, including the first miller in town, as well as A. A. Perley.

The home of Wolseley&#x27;s first mayor, R. A. Magee, is another heritage property. It remains a private residence, and is situated immediately south of the Town Hall and Opera House.

==Community==

It has two schools, Dr. Isman Elementary School and Wolseley High School. The recently rebuilt &quot;swinging bridge&quot; has been a feature of Wolseley since 1905. It has a twelve-bed hospital, an eighty-bed nursing home, and two resident doctors.

The town is served by three weekly newspapers: &quot;The Wolseley Bulletin&quot;, &quot;The Indian Head-Wolseley News&quot; and &quot;The Grenfell Sun&quot;. A tourist information radio station, CISE-FM, is based out of Wolseley.

Wolseley has a modern artificial ice arena, a curling rink, a nine-hole golf course, and a public swimming beach which is located on the shore of Fairly Lake, the town&#x27;s most distinguishing feature. This body of water was formed when the Canadian Pacific Railway dammed a creek in order to obtain a water supply for its steam engines. The town was named one of Canada&#x27;s prettiest, most historic towns by &quot;Harrowsmith Country Life&quot; in 2000.

Wolseley is home to a thriving arts community and in the downtown area there is an art gallery which is the meeting place of the Wolseley Writers Group, the Wolseley Photography Club, and the Ellisboro Artisans Guild. The Twilite Drive-In Theater in Wolseley is one of the few left in Saskatchewan. The others include the Jubilee Drive-In Theatre in Manitou Beach, the Clearwater Drive-In in Kyle, the Moonlight Movies Drive-in in Pilot Butte, and the Prairie Dog Drive-in Theatre in Carlyle.

<doc id="418118" wikidata="Q334832" url="?curid=418118" title="International Mobile Equipment Identity">
<text>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a numeric identifier, usually unique, for 3GPP and iDEN mobile phones, as well as some satellite phones. It is usually found printed inside the battery compartment of the phone but can also be displayed on-screen on most phones by entering the MMI Supplementary Service code codice_1 on the dialpad, or alongside other system information in the settings menu on smartphone operating systems.

GSM networks use the IMEI number to identify valid devices, and can stop a stolen phone from accessing the network. For example, if a mobile phone is stolen, the owner can have their network provider use the IMEI number to blocklist the phone. This renders the phone useless on that network and sometimes other networks, even if the thief changes the phone&#x27;s SIM card.

Devices without a SIM card slot or eSIM capability usually do not have an IMEI, except for certain early Sprint LTE devices such as the Samsung Galaxy Nexus and S III which emulated a SIM-free CDMA activation experience and lacked roaming capabilities in 3GPP-only countries. However, the IMEI only identifies the device and has no particular relationship to the subscriber. The phone identifies the subscriber by transmitting the International mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number, which is stored on a SIM card that can, in theory, be transferred to any handset. However, the network&#x27;s ability to know a subscriber&#x27;s current, individual device enables many network and security features.

Dual SIM enabled phones will normally have two IMEI numbers, except for devices such as the Pixel 3 (which has an eSIM and one physical SIM) which only allow one SIM card to be active at once.

==IMEI and the law==
Many countries have acknowledged the use of the IMEI in reducing the effect of mobile phone thefts. For example, in the United Kingdom, under the Mobile Telephones (Re-programming) Act, changing the IMEI of a phone, or possessing equipment that can change it, is considered an offence under some circumstances.
A bill was introduced in the United States by Senator Chuck Schumer in 2012 that would have made the changing of an IMEI illegal, but the bill was not enacted.

IMEI blocking is not the only way to fight phone theft. Instead, mobile operators are encouraged to take measures such as immediate suspension of service and replacement of SIM cards in case of loss or theft.

The existence of a formally allocated IMEI number range for a GSM terminal does not mean that the terminal is approved or complies with regulatory requirements. The linkage between regulatory approval and IMEI allocation was removed in April 2000, with the introduction of the European R&amp;TTE Directive. Since that date, IMEIs have been allocated by BABT (or one of several other regional administrators acting on behalf of the GSM Association) to legitimate GSM terminal manufacturers without the need to provide evidence of approval.

=== Blocklists of stolen devices ===
When someone has their mobile equipment stolen or lost, they can ask their service provider to block the phone from their network, and the operator may do so, especially if required by law. If the local operator maintains an Equipment Identity Register (EIR), it adds the device IMEI to it. Optionally, it also adds the IMEI to shared registries, such as the Central Equipment Identity Register (CEIR), which blocklists the device with other operators that use the CEIR. This blocklisting makes the device unusable on any operator that uses the CEIR, which makes mobile equipment theft pointless, except for parts.

To make blocklisting effective, the IMEI number is supposed to be difficult to change. However, a phone&#x27;s IMEI may be easy to change with special tools. In addition, IMEI is an un-authenticated mobile identifier (as opposed to IMSI, which is routinely authenticated by home and serving mobile networks.) Using a spoofed IMEI can thwart some efforts to track handsets, or target handsets for lawful intercept.

Australia was the first nation to implement IMEI blocking across all GSM networks, in 2003. In Australia the Electronic Information Exchange (EIE) Administration Node provides a blocked IMEI lookup service for Australian customers.

In the UK, a voluntary charter operated by the mobile networks ensures that any operator&#x27;s blocklisting of a handset is communicated to the CEIR and subsequently to all other networks. This ensures that the handset is quickly unusable for calls, at most within 48 hours.

Some UK Police forces, including the Metropolitan Police Service, actively check IMEI numbers of phones found involved in crime.

In New Zealand, the NZ Telecommunications Forum Inc provides a blocked IMEI lookup service for New Zealand consumers. The service allows up to three lookups per day and checks against a database that is updated daily by the three major mobile network operators. A blocked IMEI cannot be connected to any of these three operators.

In Latvia the SIA &quot;Datorikas institūts DIVI&quot; provides a blocked IMEI lookup service for checks against a database that is updated by all major mobile network operators in Latvia.

In some countries, such blocklisting is not customary. In 2012, major network companies in the United States, under government pressure, committed to introducing a blocklisting service, but it&#x27;s not clear whether it will interoperate with the CEIR. GSM carriers AT&amp;T and T-Mobile began blocking newly reported IMEIs in November 2012. Thefts reported prior to November 2012 were not added to the database. The CTIA refers users to websites at www.stolenphonechecker.org and the GSMA where consumers can check whether a smartphone has been reported as lost or stolen to its member carriers. The relationship between the former and any national or international IMEI blocklists is unclear.

It is unclear whether local barring of IMEI has any positive effect, as it may result in international smuggling of stolen phones.

===Limitations===
IMEIs can sometimes be removed from a blocklist, depending on local arrangements. This would typically include quoting a password chosen at the time of blocklisting.

===Law enforcement and intelligence use===
Law enforcement and intelligence services can use an IMEI number as input for tracking devices that are able to locate a cell phone with an accuracy of a few meters. Saudi Arabian government agencies have reportedly used IMEI numbers retrieved from cell phone packaging to locate and detain women who fled Saudi Arabia&#x27;s patriarchal society in other countries.

An IMEI number retrieved from the remnants of a Nokia 5110 was used to trace and identify the perpetrators behind the 2002 Bali bombings.

===Allowlists===
Some countries use allowlists instead of blocklists for IMEI numbers, so that any mobile phone needs to be legally registered in the country in order to be able to access mobile networks of the country, with possible exceptions for international roaming and a grace period for registering. These include Chile, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Colombia, and Nepal. Other countries that have adopted some form of mandatory IMEI registration include India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand, Iran, Nigeria, Ecuador, Ukraine, Lebanon, and Kenya.

Prior to their merger with T-Mobile, Sprint in the United States used an allowlist of devices where a user had to register their IMEI and SIM card before a LTE-capable device could be used, despite no US law mandating it. If a user changed their device, they had to register their new IMEI and SIM card. This isn&#x27;t the case with other CDMA carriers like Verizon which only used allowlists for 3G (which was a requirement for CDMA) and T-Mobile does not use an allowlist but instead a blocklist, including for former Sprint customers.

AT&amp;T and Telus also use an allowlist for VoLTE access, but does not require IMEI registration by customers. Instead, phone manufacturers are required to register their devices into AT&amp;T&#x27;s or Telus&#x27; databases, and customers are able to freely swap SIM cards or eSIMs into any allowlisted device. This has the problem that imported phones and some non-imported phones such as older OnePlus models or select CDMA-capable LTE devices (including models sold on Verizon or Sprint) will not work for voice calls even if they have the LTE/5G bands for AT&amp;T and Telus and support VoLTE on competitors or via VoLTE roaming.

==Structure of the IMEI and IMEISV (IMEI software version)==
The IMEI (15 decimal digits: 14 digits plus a check digit) or IMEISV (16 decimal digits: 14 digits plus two software version digits) includes information on the origin, model, and serial number of the device. The structure of the IMEI/SV is specified in 3GPP TS 23.003. The model and origin comprise the initial 8-digit portion of the IMEI/SV, known as the Type Allocation Code (TAC). The remainder of the IMEI is manufacturer-defined, with a Luhn check digit at the end. For the IMEI format prior to 2003, the GSMA guideline was to have this Check Digit always transmitted to the network as zero. This guideline seems to have disappeared for the format valid from 2003 onwards.

, the format of the IMEI is &quot;AA-BBBBBB-CCCCCC-D&quot;, although it may not always be displayed this way. The IMEISV does not have the Luhn check digit but instead has two digits for the Software Version Number (SVN), making the format &quot;AA-BBBBBB-CCCCCC-EE&quot;

Prior to 2002, the TAC was six digits and followed by a two-digit Final Assembly Code (FAC), which was a manufacturer-specific code indicating the location of the device&#x27;s construction.
From January 1, 2003 until April 1, 2004, the FAC for all phones was 00.
After April 1, 2004, the Final Assembly Code ceased to exist and the Type Allocation Code increased to eight digits in length.

In any of the above cases, the first two digits of the TAC are the Reporting Body Identifier, which identifies the GSMA-approved group that allocated the TAC. The RBI numbers are allocated by the Global Decimal Administrator. IMEI numbers being decimal helps distinguish them from an MEID, which is hexadecimal and always has 0xA0 or larger as the first two hexadecimal digits.

For example, the old style IMEI code 35-209900-176148-1 or IMEISV code 35-209900-176148-23 tells us the following:

TAC: 35-2099 - issued by the BABT (code 35) with the allocation number 2099
FAC: 00 - indicating the phone was made during the transition period when FACs were being removed.
SNR: 176148 - uniquely identifying a unit of this model
CD: 1 so it is a GSM Phase 2 or higher
SVN: 23 - The &quot;software version number&quot; identifying the revision of the software installed on the phone. 99 is reserved.
By contrast, the new style IMEI code 49-015420-323751-8 has an 8-digit TAC of 49-015420.

The CDMA Mobile Equipment Identifier uses the same basic format as the IMEI but gives more flexibility in allocation sizes and usage.

=== Check digit computation ===

The last number of the IMEI is a check digit, calculated using the Luhn algorithm, as defined in the IMEI Allocation and Approval Guidelines:

The Check Digit shall be calculated according to Luhn formula (ISO/IEC 7812). (See GSM 02.16 / 3GPP 22.016). The Check Digit is a function of all other digits in the IMEI. The Software Version Number (SVN) of a mobile is not included in the calculation.

The purpose of the Check Digit is to help guard against the possibility of incorrect entries to the CEIR and EIR equipment.

The presentation of the Check Digit both electronically and in printed form on the label and packaging is very important. Logistics (using bar-code reader) and EIR/CEIR administration cannot use the Check Digit unless it is printed outside of the packaging, and on the ME IMEI/Type Accreditation label.

The check digit is not transmitted over the radio interface, nor is it stored in the EIR database at any point. Therefore, all references to the last three or six digits of an IMEI refer to the actual IMEI number, to which the check digit does not belong.
The check digit is validated in three steps:
# Starting from the right, double every other digit (e.g., 7 → 14).
# Sum the digits (e.g., 14 → 1 + 4).
# Check if the sum is divisible by 10.
Conversely, one can calculate the IMEI by choosing the check digit that would give a sum divisible by 10. For the example IMEI 49015420323751&quot;?&quot;,

To make the sum divisible by 10, we set = 8, so the complete IMEI becomes 490154203237518.

==Usage on satellite phone networks==
The Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN), Iridium and Thuraya satellite phone networks all use IMEI numbers on their transceiver units as well as SIM cards in much the same way as GSM phones do. The Iridium 9601 modem relies solely on its IMEI number for identification and uses no SIM card; however, Iridium is a proprietary network and the device is incompatible with terrestrial GSM networks.

<doc id="418119" wikidata="Q925936" url="?curid=418119" title="Tumble finishing">
<text>Tumble finishing, also known as tumbling or rumbling, is a technique for smoothing and polishing a rough surface on relatively small parts. In the field of metalworking, a similar process called barreling, or barrel finishing, works upon the same principles.

Tumbled stones are made with rock tumblers in a process very similar to the natural processes that produce &quot;sea glass&quot; or &quot;beach glass&quot;.

==Stones==
Tumbling of rocks as a lapidary technique for rock polishing usually requires a plastic or rubber-lined barrel loaded with a consignment of rocks, all of similar or the same hardness, some abrasive grit, and a liquid lubricant. Silicon carbide grit is commonly used, and water is a universal lubricant. The barrel is then placed upon slowly rotating rails so that it rotates. The optimal speed of rotation depends on the size of the tumbler barrel and materials involved. Vibratory finishing process can be used instead.

A well-chosen speed for stone polishing causes the rocks within the barrel to slide past each other, with the abrasive grit between them. The result of this depends on the coarseness of the abrasive, and the duration of the tumble.

Typically, a full tumble polish from rough rock to polish takes 3–5 weeks, and is done in a minimum of 3 steps. Initially, the rocks are smoothed with a coarse grit (such as 60-90 mesh). The idea behind the first step is to take rough rock or stone and grind it (tumble it) down into a form which is indistinguishable (in shape) from the final product. This is followed by washing and then a stage of finer grits (120-220 then 400-600 mesh), before the (optional) use of a pre-polishing compound (1200 grit), a washing cycle with detergent to remove any grit on the stones. The final step is a polishing stage using powdered polish, (such as cerium oxide or tin oxide), water, and often small plastic pellets that are designed to cushion the stones as they tumble (so as not to cause chipping) and carry the polish evenly across the stones.

The precise tumbling duration is determined by many factors, including the hardness of the rock and the degree of smoothing desired in the coarser steps. Some people will tumble stones with rough grit for two, three or even four weeks to get their desired shapes out of the stones.

There are two main types of rock tumbling: barrel (rotary) tumbling, and vibratory tumbling. Rotary tumbling is more common, simpler, quieter and less expensive than vibratory tumblers. There are two differentiating factors, however, that may lead one to use a vibratory tumbler. First, vibratory tumblers retain the overall shape of the rough rock, whereas rotary tumblers tend to make rocks round. Thus, it is important to use vibratory tumblers to make faceted shapes and tear drop forms. Second, vibratory tumblers tend to work much faster than rotary tumblers, generally reducing the processing time to half.

In the polishing step, rock polish is added in place of grit as well as the plastic tumbling pellets. After further tumbling, the rocks should now have a shiny look when dry. If this is not the case and the rocks appear to have a film on them, a burnishing step may be necessary. In burnishing, the rocks are tumbled with only the plastic pellets and the addition of an oil-free non-abrasive soap.

Sometimes, stone &quot;preforms&quot; are used. These are shapes cut from the rough rock before tumbling. This gives more control over the final piece, so shapes such as a tear drop can be produced. The technique is still limited to rounded shapes. Preforms may use less time with the coarsest step, or skip it altogether.

During the 1970s, small rock tumblers were a common hobby item, and jewellery decorated with tumbled semi-precious stones was very much in fashion. Likewise, dishes and decorative glass jars filled with tumbled stones (often including common rocks not suitable even for costume jewelry) were frequently used as household ornaments.

==Metal==
Metal tumbling is used to burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare parts for further finishing, and break off die cast runners. The process is fairly simple: a horizontal barrel is filled with the parts which is then rotated. Variations of this process usually include media, water, or other lubricants. As the barrel is rotated the material rises until gravity causes the uppermost layer to landslide down to the other side. The barrel may also have vanes, typically made of rubber, which run along the inside of the barrel. As the barrel turns the vanes catch and lift the parts, which eventually slide down or fall.

In a wet processes a compound, lubricant, or barreling soap is added to aid the finishing process, prevent rusting, and to clean parts. A wide variety of media is available to achieve the desired finished product. Common media materials include: sand, granite chips, slag, steel, ceramics, and synthetics. Moreover, these materials are available in a wide variety of shapes. Usually different shapes are used in the same load to reach into every geometry of the part.

Tumbling is an economical finishing process because large batches of parts can be run with little or no supervision by the operator. A full cycle can take anywhere from 6 to 24 hours with the barrel turning at 20 to 38 RPM. Tumbling is usually most efficient with the barrel half full. Some processes also use a filter system to allow parts or other materials in the cylinder to be separated.

The disadvantages of this process are that the abrasive action cannot be limited to only certain areas of the part, cycle times are long, and the process is noisy.

===Specific types===
&quot;Barrel burnishing&quot; is a type of barreling where no cutting action is desired. The goal is to reduce minute irregularities and produce a clean, smooth surface. The parts are usually tumbled against themselves or with steel balls, shot, rounded-end pins, or ballcones to achieve this. It is also usually a wet process that uses water and a lubricant or cleaning agent, such as soap or cream of tartar. The barrel is not loaded more than half full and if media is used then a 2:1 ratio of media to parts is maintained to keep the parts from rubbing.

&quot;Centrifugal barrel tumbling&quot; uses a tumbling barrel at the end of a rotating arm to add centrifugal forces to the barreling process. This can accelerate the process 25 to 50 times.

&quot;&quot; mounts the workpieces onto spindles that rotate the parts opposite that of the media flow. This prevents the parts from interacting with each other and accelerates the cycle time, but extra time and cost are required to fixture the workpieces.

==Glass==
Stained glass shards used for mosaic glass are also tumbled. No abrasive is used, to avoid clouding the glass; there is only water as a lubricant. The object of this tumbling is to remove the sharp edges from the glass, so that it may be handled safely. As little as 8 hours of tumbling may be sufficient for tumbled glass.

==Other==
Tumbling is used to polish and smooth dice for recreational use, but it has the unfortunate effect of making their sides and faces somewhat uneven and thus making the dice less than fair.

Tumbling can be used in 3D printing to correct small artifacts on the printed objects, such as visible layers.

These techniques, although they take a long time, involve very little operator intervention and thus are very cheap. Small tumblers (one pound capacity) are available and inexpensive for home/hobbyist use. At the other end of the scale, professionals can use very large barrels to do a lot of work at once. The main disadvantage of tumbling is its limited scope - stones will be smooth and have semi-random shapes (like pebbles from the beach), and metals need to be relatively simple shapes, with no fine work.

<text>Ugadi or Yugadi, also known as Samvatsarādi (meaning &quot;beginning of the year&quot;), is New Year&#x27;s Day according to the Hindu calendar and is celebrated in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka. The cycle actually consists of 60 years, each year individually named. The first day of each year is called &#x27;Ugadi&#x27;. The word Ugadi can be split into two: Uga means Course of Stars and Adi means Starting. It is festively observed in these regions on the first day of the Hindu lunisolar calendar month of Chaitra. This typically falls in late March or early April of the Gregorian calendar. It also falls sometimes on the day after Amavasya with 27th Nakshatra Revati. Ugadi day is pivoted on the first New Moon after March Equinox.

The day is observed by drawing colourful patterns on the floor called &quot;Muggulu/ Rangoli&quot;, mango leaf decorations on doors called &quot;torana&quot;, buying and giving gifts such as new clothes, giving charity to the poor, oil massages followed by special baths, preparing and sharing a special food called &quot;pachadi&quot;, and visiting Hindu temples. The &quot;pachadi&quot; is a notable festive food that combines all flavors – sweet, sour, salty, bitter, astringent and piquant. In Telugu and Kannada Hindu traditions, it is a symbolic reminder that one must expect all flavors of experiences in the coming new year and make the most of them. Followers of the Souramana calendar system observe Ugadi in Karnataka, when the sun transits into the Aries Constellation, which is also the festival of Baisakhi, and is locally known as Souramana Ugadi or Mesha Sankranti.

Ugadi has been an important and historic festival of the Hindus, with medieval texts and inscriptions recording major charitable donations to Hindu temples and community centers on this day. The same day is observed as a New Year by Hindus in many other parts of India, such as Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Goa and is a national public holiday in Mauritius.

== Etymology ==
The name Yugadi or Ugadi is derived from the Sanskrit words &quot;yuga&quot; (age) and &quot;ādi&quot; (beginning): &quot;the beginning of a new age&quot;. Yugadi or Ugadi falls on &quot;Chaitra Shudhdha Paadyami&quot; or the first day of the bright half of the Indian month of Chaitra. This generally falls in late March or early April of the Gregorian calendar.

The Telugu people use the term Ugadi (ఉగాది) and the Kannadigas use the term Yugadi (ಯುಗಾದಿ) for this festival.

== Practices ==

The Kannada, Telugu, Kodava and the Tulu diaspora in Karnataka , Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu celebrate the festival with great fanfare; gatherings of the extended family and a sumptuous feast are &#x27;de rigueur&#x27;. The day begins early with ritual showers, rubbing the body with perfumed oil, followed by prayers.
Preparations for the festival begin a week ahead. Houses are given a thorough clean. People buy new clothes, including dhoti, and buy new items for the festival, decorate the entrance of their houses with fresh mango leaves. Mango leaves and coconuts are considered auspicious in the Hindu tradition, and they are used on Ugadi. People also clean the front of their house with water and cow dung paste, then draw colorful floral designs. People offer prayers in temples. The celebration of Ugadi is marked by religious zeal and social merriment. According to Vasudha Narayanan, a professor of Religion at the University of Florida:

The pacchadi festive dish symbolically reminds the people that the following year – as all of life – will consist of not just sweet experiences, but a combination of sweet, sour, salty, and bitter episodes. Just as the different substances are bound together, one is reminded that no event or episode is wholly good or bad. Even in the midst of bitter experiences, there are sweet moments. One is also reminded that the experience of taste is transitory and ephemeral; so too, is life, and one has to learn to put pain and pleasure in proper temporal perspective.
Special dishes are prepared for the occasion. In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, foods such as pulihora, bobbatlu (Bhakshalu/ polelu/ oligale), New Year Burelu and Pachadi, and preparations made with raw mango go well with the occasion. Of these, &quot;pachadi&quot; (or &quot;Ugadi pacchadi&quot;) is the most notable, and consists of a chutney-like dish which combines ingredients to give all six flavours of food : sweet, sour, salty, spicy, bitter and astringent. This festive Hindu food is made from tamarind paste (sour), neem flowers (bitter), brown sugar or sweet jaggery (sweet), table salt (salt), green chilli (spicy) and raw mango (astringent). It is a symbolic reminder of complex phases of life one should reasonably expect in the new year.

In Karnataka, foods such as Holige or Obattu, and mango pickles are made. In addition, a speciality of yugadi in Karnataka is to create &quot;bEvu-bella&quot; a mixture of neem and jaggery, to signify both the sweet and the bitter or the sihi-kahi(ಸಿಹಿ-ಕಹಿ). This symbolizes life&#x27;s own experiences with a little bit of bitterness and a hint of sweetness.

==Related festivals==
Maharashtran Hindus refer to the festival, observed on the same day, as Gudi Padwa (). The Sindhis celebrate the same day as Cheti Chand, which is the beginning of their calendar year. Manipuris also celebrate their New Year as Sajibu Nongma Panba on the same day.

The Hindus of Bali in Indonesia also celebrate their new year on the same day as Nyepi. Ugadi is one of the five Hindu national public holidays in Mauritius.

<doc id="418121" wikidata="Q2381494" url="?curid=418121" title="Darkwing Duck (Capcom video game)">
<text>Darkwing Duck is a platform video game developed and published by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. It was based on the Disney animated television series &quot;Darkwing Duck.&quot; It was ported to the Game Boy in 1993.

==Plot==
A mysterious crime wave has hit St. Canard and S.H.U.S.H. requires the services of the caped crime fighter Darkwing Duck to stop it as it appears that F.O.W.L. and their valued operative Steelbeak is behind the uprising. They have hired six of Darkwing&#x27;s greatest foes to wreak havoc in different areas throughout St. Canard. Darkwing must subdue each of these criminals in order to find Steelbeak and save the city. 

The six hired criminals consist of The Fearsome Five, which are The Liquidator, Megavolt, Dr. Reginald Bushroot, and Quackerjack. Two hired additional hired criminals are Professor Moliarty, and Wolfduck, an original character who was created specifically for this game.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; is a platform game with a couple of elements similar to Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Mega Man&quot; video game series. The gameplay is based on typical platforming while using a Gas Gun to take down enemies. The player may choose from three different stages at the start of the game with another set of three becoming available after that. Once all six stages are clear, Darkwing proceeds to F.O.W.L.&#x27;s Floating Fortress for his final confrontation with Steel Beak.

Darkwing begins with his standard Gas Gun but can collect different types of gas throughout each stage: Thunder, Heavy, and Arrow. Each special gas requires ammunition and take up different amounts and functions differently, but the player can only have one type of special gas at a time. Picking up a different type of special gas replaces the one Darkwing currently has. The player can freely switch between the special gas and the standard gas by hitting Select. Darkwing can also deflect certain projectiles with his cape by hitting Up on the control pad.
== Release ==
The NES version was released in North America in June 1992, followed by a Game Boy version released in February 1993.

The NES version of the game was included alongside other games in &quot;The Disney Afternoon Collection&quot; compilation for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in April 2017.

A sequel to the game featuring 16-bit styled graphics was pitched to Capcom by Headcannon, one of the developers of &quot;Sonic Mania&quot;. The pitch was ultimately rejected and Headcannon released their playable prototype online on January 7, 2019.

==Reception==

The game has been considered an example of the quality Disney games produced by Capcom. The game was received well by critics.

A reviewer for a &quot;Nintendo Magazine System UK&quot; noted that the Game Boy version of a game is different from &quot;rest of the potboiler platformers gracing the Gameboy&quot;, and is &quot;entertaining and varied&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the game a B and noted the similarities between the game and the &quot;Mega Man&quot; series. Nintendo Power ranked Darkwing Duck the third best Game Boy game of 1993.

==Rejected sequel==
In 2018, Aaron Sparrow, lead writer for &quot;The Duck Knight Returns&quot; comic, worked alongside &quot;Sonic Mania&quot; developer Headcannon (as well as its main developer Simon Thomley) and Disney comic artist James Silvani to create a proposal for Capcom to create a sequel to the NES video game &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;. Simon had been interested in making a &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; video game for a while. They were inspired to an extent by WayForward Technologies&#x27; &quot;&quot;, a remake of the NES &quot;DuckTales&quot; video game. Headcannon created a short prototype of the game as part of this, and those involved said they would be attempting to get every member of the TV show&#x27;s voice cast as they could. Simon asked a Capcom representative about the prospects of a sequel, and in response to what seemed to be interest, they went to work on the project. Further communication did not have results, and they were advised that Disney was likely to turn down the idea regardless. Aaron and Simon went into detail about the proposal in 2019, when the demonstration was released on Headcannon&#x27;s official website for people to download, though it is shorter due to the rejection.

&quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; uses pixel graphics, vintage music, and a two-dimensional perspective as well as similar gameplay to the original NES game with only a small number of changes and additions. The game featured a Game Boy Advance-like visual filter. It was meant to be either a spiritual sequel or, if Capcom desired, a remake of the original game in a similar style to &quot;DuckTales Remastered&quot;. The game would have featured animated art by James as well as fully voiced motion comics in between the stages. It would have taken place between the original TV show and Aaron&#x27;s comic, featuring &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; villains Steelbeak, Taurus Bulba, and the Fearsome Five. The level in the demo is a sewer level.

USGamer writer Matt Kim expressed hope that the video of the proposal would renew interest. Kotaku&#x27;s Ethan Gach notes that while the demo lacks polish, it has merit. They found the mouse and keyboard controls to be less than ideal and speculated that it may be why Capcom decided to pass on the project. They however felt that the sound and visuals demonstrated a passion for the NES game by the people involved. Writer William Usher was critical of the decision to set the prototype in a sewer and stated that it did not immediately appeal to them as a result, but felt that the prototype was still polished.

<text>Jaggery is a traditional non-centrifugal cane sugar consumed in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, North America, Central America, Brazil and Africa. It is a concentrated product of cane juice and often date or palm sap without separation of the molasses and crystals, and can vary from golden brown to dark brown in colour. It contains up to 50% sucrose, up to 20% invert sugars, and up to 20% moisture, with the remainder made up of other insoluble matter, such as wood ash, proteins, and bagasse fibres. Jaggery is very similar to muscovado, an important sweetener in Portuguese, British and French cuisine.

Jaggery comes from Portuguese terms , , borrowed from Malayalam (), which is borrowed from Sanskrit (). It is a of .

==Origins and production==


Jaggery is made of the products of sugarcane and the toddy palm tree. The sugar made from the sap of the date palm is more prized and less commonly available outside of the regions where it is made. The toddy palm is tapped for producing jaggery in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka.

In Sri Lanka, syrup extracts from &quot;kithul&quot; (&quot;Caryota urens&quot;) trees are widely used for jaggery production.

All types of the sugar come in blocks or pastes of solidified concentrated sugar syrup heated to . Traditionally, the syrup is made by boiling raw sugarcane juice or palm sap in large, shallow, round-bottomed vessels.

===Preparation===
Historically, the sugarcane cultivators used crushers that were powered by oxen, but all modern crushers are power-driven. These crushers are placed in fields near the sugarcane plants. The cut and cleaned sugarcane is crushed and the extracted cane juice is collected in a large vessel. A quantity of the juice is transferred to a smaller vessel for heating in a furnace.

The vessel is heated for about an hour. Dried wood pulp from the crushed sugarcane is traditionally used as fuel for the furnace. While boiling the juice, lime is added to it so that all the wood particles rise to the top of the juice in a froth, which is skimmed off. Finally, the juice is thickened. The resulting thick liquid is about one-third of the original volume.

This hot liquid is golden in colour. It is stirred continuously and lifted with a spatula to observe whether it forms a thread or drips while falling. If it forms many threads, it has completely thickened. It is poured into a shallow flat-bottomed pan to cool and solidify. The pan is extremely large to allow only a thin coat of this hot liquid to form at its bottom, so as to increase the surface area for quick evaporation and cooling. After cooling, the jaggery becomes a soft solid that is then molded into the desired shape.

The quality of jaggery is judged by its colour; dark brown means it was not clarified during the making, or the sugarcane juice was boiled with full nutrients intact. Some people misinterpret this as impure and clarify the juice to improve colour while taking out the nutrients to make golden-yellow jaggery, which is nothing but refined sugar. Due to this grading scale, coloured adulterants, which may be toxic, are sometimes added to jaggery to simulate the golden hue.

Natural dark brown jaggery is derived from whole sugarcane juice, by means of boiling at nearly 200°C in a large cast iron pan. Food-grade mustard or castor oil (having a high smoke point) is usually used in such pans in negligible quantity (approximately 2 teaspoons per 100kg) so that the very hot juice froth does not come out of pan during boiling. Mustard or castor oil is present in whole jaggery in traces, and the qualities of such oils (laxative) coincide and support this quality of whole jaggery.

Many manufacturers use synthetic oil and argue that since it is in trace amounts there is no health concern. However, synthetic oil even in traces can be toxic. So, one not only needs to verify the wholesomeness of jaggery (attained with no clarification), but also verify the type of oil used, even in traces.

==Uses==
===South Asia (Indian subcontinent)===
Jaggery is used as an ingredient in sweet and savoury dishes in the cuisines of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Iran. For example, a pinch of it is sometimes added to &quot;sambar, rasam&quot; and other staples in Udupi cuisine. Jaggery is added to lentil soups (&quot;dāl&quot;) to add sweetness to balance the spicy, salty, and sour components, particularly in Gujarati cuisine.

In Sri Lanka, jaggery is usually made using the syrup of the kithul palm tree, or from coconut syrup. The respective names in Sinhalese are &quot;kitul hakuru&quot; (කිතුල් හකුරු) and &quot;pol hakuru&quot; (පොල් හකුරු). Jaggery from the syrup of the Palmyrah palm is more prominent in the northern part of the country; this is referred to as palmyrah jaggery or &quot;thal hakuru&quot; (තල් හකුරු). Jaggery made from sugarcane syrup is considered inferior to palm syrup-based jaggery varieties, and the term jaggery (හකුරු) is generally understood in the country to refer to the latter.

Maharashtra in India is the largest producer and consumer of jaggery known as &quot;gul&quot; (गुळ) in Marathi and Marwadi, &quot;gur&quot; (گڑ) in Urdu, &quot;bellaṁ&quot; (బెల్లం) in Telugu, bella (ಬೆಲ್ಲ) in Kannada, &quot;Vellam&quot;(வெல்லம்) in Tamil, &quot;sharkara&quot; (ശർക്കര) in Malayalam , &quot;Gōḷa&quot; (ગોળ) in Gujarati , &quot;miṣṭa&quot; (मिष्ट) in Sanskrit, &quot;guṛa&quot; (ଗୁଡ଼) in Odia, &quot;gur&quot; (गुड़) in Hindi and , &quot; guṛ&quot; (গুড়) in Bengali.

Kolhapur is one of the largest producers of jaggery in India and has a GI Tag for Kolhapur jaggery. Most vegetable dishes, curries, and &quot;dals&quot;, and many desserts contain it. Jaggery is especially used during Makar Sankranti for making a dessert called &quot;tilgul&quot;. In Gujarat, a similar preparation known called &quot;tal na ladu&quot; or &quot;tal sankli&quot; is made. In rural Maharashtra and Karnataka, water and a piece of jaggery are given to a person arriving home from working under a hot sun. In Indian culture during the New Year feast, jaggery-based sweets are made. In Andhra, Telangana and Karnataka on Ugadi festival day (New Year), Ugadi Pachadi is made from jaggery and five other ingredients (shad ruchulu- sweet, sour, salt, tangy, spice and bitter) and is consumed symbolizing life is a mixture of happiness, disgust, fear, surprise, anger and sadness. Also, it is considered auspicious to see jaggery in dreams in Hinduism.

Molasses (काकवी), a byproduct of the production of jaggery, is used in rural Maharashtra and Karnataka as a sweetener. It contains many minerals not found in ordinary sugar and is considered beneficial to health in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. It is an ingredient of many sweet delicacies, such as &quot;gur ke chawal / chol&quot; (&quot;jaggery rice&quot;), a traditional Rajasthani or Punjabi dish.

In Gujarat, &quot;laddus&quot; are made from wheat flour and jaggery. A well-known Maharashtrian recipe, &quot;puran poli&quot;, uses it as a sweetener apart from sugar. Jaggery is considered an easily available sweet which is shared on any good occasion. In engagement ceremonies, small particles of it are mixed with coriander seeds (ધાણા). Hence, in many Gujarati communities, engagement is commonly known by the metonym &quot;gol-dhana&quot; (ગોળ-ધાણા), literally &quot;jaggery and coriander seeds&quot;.

Jaggery is used extensively in South India to balance the pungency of spicy foods. In Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu it is used for sweets such as &quot;chakkara pongal&quot; and &quot;milk pongal&quot;, which are prepared with rice, milk, and jaggery. During Sankranti, &quot;Ariselu&quot;, an authentic Andhra Pradesh dish, is prepared. In Tamil Nadu, &quot;ellurundai&quot; (sesame balls), Adhirasam and &quot;pori vilangu urundai&quot; (puffed rice balls) are prepared as an offering - called &quot;prasadam&quot; - to god during Puja and festivals such as Diwali, Tamil New Year and Janmashtami.

A sweet liquid called &quot;Paanakam&quot;, made of water, jaggery and peppercorns is prepared as the favorite offering to Lord Rama during Rama Navami festival. In Kerala, it is considered auspicious and is widely used in cooking. It is a vital ingredient in many varieties of &quot;payasam&quot;, a sweet dish. The state of Kerala as 2 GI tagged jaggeries by the name of Central Travancore jaggery and Marayoor jaggery

In Tamil Nadu, jaggery is used exclusively as a sweetener. It is used in a dish called &quot;chakkarai pongal&quot;. It is prepared during the festival of Pongal (Thai Pongal), which is held when the harvesting season begins. It is used to make kalhi, to sweeten fruit salads and payasam (sweet milk) that are offered to the gods. Jaggery is used in religious rituals. In rural areas, cane jaggery and palm jaggery are used to sweeten beverages, whereas refined sugar has replaced it in urban areas.

In Odia cuisine, cakes or &quot;piṭhas&quot; contain jaggery. Pithas like Arisa pitha are made out of jaggery called guda in Odia. Kakara pitha contains coconut filings which are caramelized using jaggery. Guda is also added to rice flakes known as &quot;chuda&quot; and eaten for breakfast. Some marmalade made of mango and &quot;dillenia&quot; contain the ingredient.

In Bengali cuisine, it is commonly used in making sweet dishes, some of which mix jaggery with milk and coconut. Popular sweet dishes such as &quot;laḍḍu&quot;/&quot;laṛu&quot; or &quot;paṭishapta piṭha&quot; mix it with coconut shreds. Jaggery is molded into novel shapes as a type of candy. The same preparation of sweets have been made in the neighbouring state of Assam. Some of the popular sweet dishes of Assam such as &quot;til-pitha&quot; (made of rice powder, sesame and jaggery), other rice-based &quot;pitha&quot;, and &quot;payas&quot; are made of jaggery. In some villages of Assam, people drink salty red tea with a cube of &quot;gurd&quot; (jaggery), which is popularly called &quot;cheleka-chah&quot; (licking tea).

Traditional Karnataka sweets, such as &quot;paayasa, obbattu (holige)&quot; and &quot;unday&quot; use different kinds of jaggery. A pinch is commonly added to &quot;sambar&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;huLi saaru&quot;) and &quot;rasam&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;saaru&quot;). Karnataka produces sugar and palm-based jaggery.

Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh has the largest jaggery market in the world along with having a GI Tag for Muzaffarnagar jaggery, followed by Anakapalle in the Visakhapatnam District in Andhra Pradesh. The Kolhapur District in western Maharashtra is famous for its jaggery, which is yellow and much sought-after in Maharashtra and Gujarat. Mandya in Karnataka is known for its jaggery production.

===Southeast Asia===
In Myanmar, jaggery, called &quot;htanyet&quot; () in Burmese, is harvested from toddy palm syrup. In central Myanmar and around Bagan (Pagan), toddy syrup is collected solely for making jaggery. The translucent white syrup is boiled until it becomes golden brown and then made into bite-size pieces. It is considered a sweet and is eaten by children and adults alike, usually in the afternoon with a pot of green tea. It has been referred to locally as Burmese chocolate. Toddy palm jaggery is sometimes mixed with coconut shreds, jujube puree or sesame, depending on the area. This type of jaggery is used in Burmese cooking, usually to add colour and enrich the food.

===Other uses===
Other uses include jaggery toffees and jaggery cake made with pumpkin preserve, cashew nuts, peanuts and spices. Jaggery may be used in the creation of alcoholic beverages such as palm wine.

Besides being a food, jaggery may be used (mixed in an emulsion with buttermilk and mustard oil) to season the inside of tandoor ovens.

Jaggery is used in natural dyeing of fabric. It is also used in hookahs in rural areas of Pakistan and India.

<doc id="418127" wikidata="Q14088062" url="?curid=418127" title="16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party">
<text>The 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party was held in Beijing between November 8 and 14, 2002. It was preceded by the 15th National Congress and was succeeded by the 17th National Congress. 2,114 delegates and 40 specially invited delegates represented the party&#x27;s estimated 66 million members.

The Party National Congress examined and adopted the amendment to the Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party proposed by the 15th CCP Central Committee, and decided to come into force as from the date of its adoption. An amendment to the Constitution was approved the Party National Congress, with Jiang Zemin&#x27;s signature ideology of &quot;Three Represents&quot; written into it. The Congress and elected a 356-member 16th CCP Central Committee, as well as a 121-member Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI). The Congress marked the nominal transition of power between Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, who replaced Jiang as General Secretary, and a newly expanded Politburo Standing Committee line-up. The institutional transition would be completed in state organs by the 1st session of the 10th National People&#x27;s Congress in March 2003. Jiang, however, remained head of the Central Military Commission, therefore in practice, the power transition was not complete. 

==Members of the Party Central Committee==
The 16th CCP Central Committee is composed of 198 full members and 158 alternate members, as well as a 121-member Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.

* The Party General Secretary: Hu Jintao (November 15, 2002, the first plenary session of the 16th CCP Central Committee)
** Central Committee Secretariat: Zeng Qinghong, Liu Yunshan, Zhou Yongkang, He Guoqiang, Wang Gang, Xu Caihou and He Yong 
* 16th CCP Politburo Standing Committee: Hu Jintao, Wu Bangguo, Wen Jiabao, Jia Qinglin, Zeng Qinghong, Huang Ju, Wu Guanzheng, Li Changchun and Luo Gan
* 16th CCP Politburo: Wang Lequan, Wang Zhaoguo, Hui Liangyu (Hui), Liu Qi, Liu Yunshan, Li Changchun, Wu Yi (female), Wu Bangguo, Wu Guanzheng, Zhang Lichang, Zhang Dejiang, Chen Liangyu, Luo Gan, Zhou Yongkang, Hu Jintao, Yu Zhengsheng, He Guoqiang, Jia Qinglin, Guo Boxiong, Huang Ju, Cao Gangchuan, Zeng Qinghong, Zeng Peiyan, Wen Jiabao
* The Central Military Commission
** Chairman of the Commission: Jiang Zemin
** vice chairmen of the commission: Hu Jintao, Guo Boxiong and Cao Gangchuan
** members of the commission: Xu Caihou, Liang Guanglie, Liao Xilong and Li Jinai
* The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) 
** secretary of the CCDI: Wu Guanzheng
** deputy secretaries of the CCDI: He Yong, Xia Zanzhong, Li Zhilun, Zhang Shutian, Liu Xirong, Zhang Huixin and Liu Fengyan

=== Inner party democracy ===
Out of the nearly 200 Central Committee that was elected by the Congress, it is possible to judge from the number of votes cast in favour the delegates who lacked support in the party. Huang Ju, who was made Vice-Premier in 2003, had the fewest votes in favour, with more than 300 delegates voting against him. Others in the bottom seven, in order from least popular, were Li Changchun (CCP propaganda chief), Zhang Gaoli (then Shandong Party Chief), Jia Qinglin (CPPCC Chairman), Xi Jinping (then Zhejiang Party chief), Li Yizhong, and Chen Zhili (made State Councilor). Shanghai party chief Chen Liangyu ranked tenth from last, while Beijing party chief Liu Qi ranked twelfth from last.

== Policy changes ==
Jiang Zemin&#x27;s Go Out policy was incorporated into the report of the 16th National Congress. The Report stated that going out was a &quot;major measure taken in a new stage of China&#x27;s reform and opening movement&quot;. Academic Wendy Leutert writes that the Report marked a change from earlier statements on the Go Out policy by proposing a comprehensive and long-term economic shift towards an international focus.

Construction of a social credit system was announced during the 16th National Congress. The central government did not have a specific vision for what a finished system might look like and local governments would be allowed to develop pilot programs that could inform the larger policy approach.

At the Congress, Jiang set a goal of achieving comprehensive &quot;xiaokang&quot; by 2020. Hu Jintao later reiterated this goal at the 17th Party Congress and the 18th Party Congress.

<doc id="418134" wikidata="Q16152502" url="?curid=418134" title="County statistics of the United States">
<text>In 45 of the 50 states of the United States, the county is used for the level of local government immediately below the state itself. Louisiana uses parishes, and Alaska uses boroughs. In Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, some or all counties within states have no governments of their own; the counties continue to exist as legal entities, however, and are used by states for some administrative functions and by the United States Census bureau for statistical analysis. There are 3,242 counties and county equivalent administrative units in total, including the District of Columbia and 100 county-equivalents in the U.S. territories.

There are 41 independent cities in the United States. In Virginia, any municipality that is incorporated as a city legally becomes independent of any county. Where indicated, the statistics below do not include Virginia&#x27;s 38 independent cities.

In Alaska, most of the land area of the state has no county-level government. Those parts of the state are divided by the United States Census Bureau into census areas, which are not the same as boroughs. The state&#x27;s largest statistical division by area is the Yukon–Koyukuk Census Area, which is larger than any of the state&#x27;s boroughs. Although Anchorage is called a municipality, it is considered a consolidated city and borough.

There are 100 county-equivalents in the territories of the United States: they are the 3 districts and 2 atolls of American Samoa, all of Guam (Guam as one single county-equivalent), the 4 municipalities in the Northern Mariana Islands, the 78 municipalities of Puerto Rico, the 3 main islands of the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the 9 islands in the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands. All of these territorial county-equivalents are defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.

==Count==

This is the number of counties and county-equivalents for each state, the District of Columbia, the 5 inhabited territories of the United States, and the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands.

Lists of counties and county equivalents by number per political division:
* Total (50 states and District of Columbia): 3,143 (3,007 counties and 136 county equivalents)
* Total (50 states, District of Columbia and territories): 3,243 (3,007 counties and 236 county equivalents)
* Average number of counties per state (not including D.C. and the territories): 62.84
* Average number of counties per state (including D.C. and the territories): 56.8947368421

==Population==

===Nationwide population extremes===
These rankings include county equivalents.
&#x27;
The following is a list of the least populous counties and county-equivalents in all U.S. territory. Note that the only entity on this list with a permanent human population is Swains Island, American Samoa. The first 8 counties (county-equivalents) are uninhabited, while the 10th on the list (Palmyra Atoll) has a small non-permanent human population whose maximum capacity is 20 people.
&lt;br&gt;
===Population per state or territory===


==Area==
===Nationwide land area extremes===

The largest counties and county-equivalents are organized boroughs and the census areas of Alaska with the top two being Yukon–Koyukuk Census Area () and North Slope Borough (). The smallest counties and county equivalents (in the 50 states) are the independent cities of Virginia with the extreme being Falls Church at . If the U.S. territories are included, the smallest county-equivalent is Kingman Reef, with a land area of .

The following two tables exclude county-equivalents:


The following two tables include county-equivalents: 


*Largest county or county-equivalent: Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska
*Largest true county: San Bernardino County, California
*Smallest county or county-equivalent: Kingman Reef, U.S. Minor Outlying Islands
*Smallest county or county-equivalent in the 50 states: Independent City of Falls Church, Virginia
*Smallest true county: Kalawao County, Hawaii
&lt;br&gt;
===Smallest, largest, and average area per state and territory===
The following is a list of counties and county-equivalents showing the average size of each state/territory&#x27;s counties, the smallest county (or equivalent) in each state/territory, and the largest county (or equivalent) in each state/territory. States/territories on the list are arranged by the average land area of their counties. Though not on the list, the North Slope Borough is the largest independently incorporated county equivalent. The Unorganized Borough is substantially larger, but is an extension of the State of Alaska government and not independently incorporated.

Also note that the smallest land area with county-level governance in the U.S. is Falls Church, Virginia, but it is an independent city and not a county or part of one. Kingman Reef is the smallest county-equivalent in all U.S. territory (though it has no government). Kalawao County, Hawaii is the smallest true county by land area.

==Population density==
===Most densely populated===

Data presented below is based on U.S. Census department data from 2010. Calculations are made by dividing the population by the land area. All county equivalents are included. This list includes the 50 most densely-populated counties and county-equivalents in the 50 states and District of Columbia, plus the 9 highest-density municipalities (county-equivalents) of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is the only U.S. territory with population densities (of county-equivalents) high enough to be on this list. Note that many of these high-density counties are coterminous with large cities (for example San Francisco and Philadelphia) or are independent cities in Virginia (as well as Baltimore and St. Louis) which are considered county-equivalents.

===Least densely populated===

This list was generated by dividing the population by the land area. All county equivalents are included. The list is dominated by just a few states: Alaska, Montana, and Texas together comprise about two-thirds of the entries. The Unorganized Borough is not included here as a unit, but its census areas (non-governmental entities) are. If the census areas were removed from the list, the Unorganized Borough would rank fourteenth with a density of .

The 8 uninhabited county-equivalents in the U.S. territories are listed at the top of the table — these are technically the least-densely populated counties/county-equivalents in the United States, but since they have no people, they are listed unranked.

===Population density per state and territory===
Data presented below is based on U.S. Census Bureau data from 2010. Calculations are made by dividing the population by the land area. All county equivalents are included.

Excluding the census areas of Alaska, Lake and Peninsula Borough is the least densely populated county equivalent with .

The District of Columbia and Guam each only have one county-equivalent, so their most/least densely-populated county is the same.

<text>Air hockey is a tabletop sport where two opposing players try to score goals against each other on a low-friction table using two hand-held discs (mallets/pushers) and a lightweight plastic puck.

The air hockey table has raised edges that allow the puck to reflect off horizontally, and a very smooth, slippery surface that further reduces friction by suspending the puck on a thin cushion of air ejected from tiny vent holes built inside the surface. This causes the puck to hover and move easily across the table with little loss of velocity, which simulates the lubricated sliding of an ice hockey puck across a well polished rink, hence the name of the game.

==Federations==
* United States Air Hockey Association (USAA) – 1978
* Air Hockey Players Association (AHPA) – 2015
* North Carolina Air Hockey Player Association (NCAHP) – 2016

== Air hockey tables ==
A typical air hockey table consists of a large smooth playing surface designed to minimize friction, a surrounding rail to prevent the puck and mallets from leaving the table, and slots in the rail at either end of the table that serve as goals. On the ends of the table behind and below the goals, there is usually a puck return. Additionally, tables will typically have some sort of machinery that produces a cushion of air on the playing surface through tiny holes, with the purpose of reducing friction and increasing play speed. In some tables, the machinery is eschewed in favor of a slick table surface, usually plastic, in the interest of saving money in both manufacturing and maintenance costs. These tables are technically not air hockey tables, since no air is involved; however, they are still generally understood to be as such due to the basic similarity of gameplay. There also exist pucks that use a battery and fan to generate their own air cushion, but as they are prone to breakage, they are commonly marketed only as toys. 

The only tables that are approved for play and sanctioned by the USAA (United States Air Hockey Association) and the AHPA (Air Hockey Players Association) for tournament play are 8-foot tables. Approved tables include all Gold Standard Games 8-foot tables; some 8-foot tables from Dynamo; and the original 8-foot commercial Brunswick tables. Other full-size novelty-type tables with flashing lights on the field of play, painted rails, and/or smaller pucks are not approved for tournament play. There are also smaller air hockey tables having a size of 1.5, 2, or 2.5 feet, called mini air hockey tables.

A mallet (sometimes called a goalie, striker or paddle) consists of a simple handle attached to a flat surface that will usually lie flush with the surface of the table. The most common mallets, called &quot;high-tops&quot;, resemble small plastic sombreros, but other mallets, &quot;flat-tops&quot;, are used with a shorter nub. 

Air hockey pucks are discs made of Lexan polycarbonate resin. Standard USAA and AHPA-approved pucks are yellow, red, and green. In competitive play, a layer of thin white tape is placed on the face-up side. Air hockey pucks come in circles and other shapes (triangle, hexagon, octagon, or square).

Four-player tables also exist, but they are not sanctioned for competitive play.

== Rules ==
The basic rules of play are listed as follows:
*The first player to reach 7 points wins the match
*First possession of the puck is determined by a face off
*Players may strike the puck with any part of the mallet, and each player can only use one mallet
*Players have seven seconds to complete a shot towards the opposing goal
*Once scored on, the player has ten seconds to return the puck back into play
*When the puck is in contact with any part of the centerline, either player may strike the puck
*Players can position themselves anywhere around the table as long as they stay on their side of the centerline
*Each player is permitted a ten-second time out each match, and must be called by the player when they are in possession of the puck, or the puck is out of play
*&quot;Palming&quot; or any use of the hand in contact with the puck is not permitted
*Contact with the puck by any part of the player is prohibited
*“Goal tending” or using the hands to prevent a goal is prohibited
*Players cannot hit the puck off the table

Fouls are issued to players who violate any of the rules. The player who receives the foul must turn possession of the puck over to the opponent. Technical fouls are issued for more severe violations, such as goal tending. When a technical foul is called, the opposing player is given a free shot on the offender&#x27;s goal. The offender is not allowed to defend the shot, but can resume play if the shot misses and bounces off their end of the table.

== Gameplay ==

Competitive (tournament) play is usually distinguished by the following:

* The mallet is gripped behind the knob using one&#x27;s fingertips, not on top of it. This allows more wrist action and helps the player to move the mallet around the table faster.
* For basic defense, the mallet is kept centered at least 8 inches out from the goal. In this position, very slight movements to the left and right will block virtually all straight shots. To block bank shots, one pulls back quickly to the corners of the goal. This is known as the &quot;triangle defense&quot;.
* Shots are often hit out of &quot;drifts&quot;, where the puck travels in set patterns designed to throw off the opponent&#x27;s expectations and timing. The most popular drifts are the &quot;center&quot;, &quot;diamond&quot;, &quot;diagonal&quot;, and &quot;L&quot;.
* Shots are often organized into groups of shots which are hit with the same apparent delivery but opposite directions, caused by hitting the puck at slightly different locations on the mallet. For example, a transverse motion of the right arm can lead to a &quot;cut shot&quot; to the left corner of the opponent&#x27;s goal or a &quot;right wall under&quot; (bank off the right wall, into the right corner of the opponent&#x27;s goal).

== History ==

Air hockey is a game resting on an older technology, the air table. Air tables began as a conveyor technology allowing heavy objects like cardboard boxes to easily slide over a table surface. The original air tables of the 1940s had rather large holes that were plugged by ball bearings. An object sitting on the table would depress the balls, allowing air to escape and lift the object slightly off the table.

By 1967, this had been refined and repurposed as a tool for teaching elementary physics. The table top was a sandwich of fiberboard or plexiglass sheets separated by a honeycomb structure. The top surface was drilled with a grid of small holes, and the space between the boards was supplied with low-pressure compressed air, just enough to allow &quot;air pucks&quot; to float over the surface.

In 1968, Sega released an arcade electro-mechanical game similar to air hockey, &quot;MotoPolo&quot;. Based on polo, two players moved miniature motorbikes around inside a cabinet, with each player attempting to knock the balls into the opponent&#x27;s goal.

Air hockey was created by a group of Brunswick Billiards employees from 1969 to 1972. In 1969, a trio of Brunswick engineers – Phil Crossman, Bob Kenrick and Brad Baldwin – began work on creating a game using a low-friction surface. The project stagnated for several years until it was revived by Bob Lemieux, who then focused on implementing an abstracted version of ice hockey, with a thin disc, two strikers and slit-like goals equipped with photodetectors. It was then decided that the game might appeal to a larger market and air hockey was marketed and sold to the general public. The original patents reference Crossman, Kendrick and Lemieux, as well as earlier work on air tables.

The game was an immediate financial success and by the mid-1970s there was interest in tournament play. As early as 1973, players in Houston had formed the Houston Air Hockey Association, and soon thereafter, the Texas Air-Hockey Players Association, codifying rules and promoting the sport through local tournaments at Houston pubs Carnabys and Damians, and the University of Houston.

The United States Air-Table Hockey Association (USAA) was formed in 1975 by J. Phillip &quot;Phil&quot; Arnold, largely as an official sanctioning body. Since its inception, the USAA has sanctioned at least one national-level or World championship each year, crowning 12 different champions over 30 years. In March 2015, the Air Hockey Players Association (AHPA) was announced and is providing air hockey players with an additional organization also overseeing the sport of air hockey. The two organizations run independently but abide by a similar set of rules and share many of the same players. In July 2015, the AHPA crowned its first world champion and also the youngest in the history of the sport in Colin Cummings of Beaumont, Texas.

Today, professional air hockey is played by a close-knit community of serious players around the world, with extensive player bases near Houston, San Francisco, Sacramento, Los Angeles, North Carolina, San Diego, Denver, Chicago, New York City, Boise, and Boston in the United States; Barcelona in Spain; Saint Petersburg, Moscow, and Novgorod in Russia; and Most and Brno in the Czech Republic. In the late 1980s, Caracas, Venezuela served as a hotbed of activity; three-time World Champion Jose Mora and other finalists originated from there. By 1999 most of the Venezuelan activity had disappeared.

<doc id="418142" wikidata="Q3268495" url="?curid=418142" title="Facet">
<text>Facets () are flat faces on geometric shapes. The organization of naturally occurring facets was key to early developments in crystallography, since they reflect the underlying symmetry of the crystal structure. Gemstones commonly have facets cut into them in order to improve their appearance by allowing them to reflect light.

== Facet arrangements ==

Of the hundreds of facet arrangements that have been used, the most famous is probably the round brilliant cut, used for diamond and many colored gemstones. This first early version of what would become the modern Brilliant Cut is said to have been devised by an Italian named Peruzzi, sometime in the late 17th century. Later on, the first angles for an &quot;ideal&quot; cut diamond were calculated by Marcel Tolkowsky in 1919. Slight modifications have been made since then, but angles for &quot;ideal&quot; cut diamonds are still similar to Tolkowsky&#x27;s formula. Round brilliants cut before the advent of &quot;ideal&quot; angles are often referred to as &quot;Early round brilliant cut&quot; or &quot;Old European brilliant cut&quot; and are considered poorly cut by today&#x27;s standards, though there is still interest in them from collectors. Other historic diamond cuts include the &quot;Old Mine Cut&quot; which is similar to early versions of the round brilliant, but has a rectangular outline, and the &quot;Rose Cut&quot; which is a simple cut consisting of a flat, polished back, and varying numbers of angled facets on the crown, producing a faceted dome. Sometimes a 58th facet, called a &quot;culet&quot; is cut on the bottom of the stone to help prevent chipping of the pavilion point. Earlier brilliant cuts often have very large culets, while modern brilliant cut diamonds generally lack the culet facet, or it may be present in minute size.

== Cutting facets ==

The art of cutting a gem is an exacting procedure performed on a faceting machine. The ideal product of facet cutting is a gemstone that displays a pleasing balance of internal reflections of light known as &quot;brilliance&quot;, strong and colorful &quot;dispersion&quot; which is commonly referred to as &quot;fire&quot;, and brightly colored flashes of reflected light known as &quot;scintillation&quot;. Typically transparent to translucent stones are faceted, although opaque materials may occasionally be faceted as the luster of the gem will produce appealing reflections. Pleonaste (black spinel) and black diamond are examples of opaque faceted gemstones.

=== Facet angles ===
The angles used for each facet play a crucial role in the outcome of a gem. While the general facet arrangement of a particular gemstone cut may appear the same in any given gem material, the angles of each facet must be carefully adjusted to maximize the optical performance. The angles used will vary based on the refractive index of the gem material. When light passes through a gemstone and strikes a polished facet, the minimum angle possible for the facet to reflect the light back into the gemstone is called the &quot;critical angle&quot;. If the ray of light strikes a surface lower than this angle, it will leave the gem material instead of reflecting through the gem as brilliance. These lost light rays are sometimes referred to as &quot;light leakage&quot;, and the effect caused by it is called &quot;windowing&quot; as the area will appear transparent and without brilliance. This is especially common in poorly cut commercial gemstones. Gemstones with higher refractive indexes generally make more desirable gemstones, the critical angle decreases as refractive indices increase, allowing for greater internal reflections as the light is less likely to escape.

=== The faceting machine ===

This machine uses a motor-driven plate to hold a precisely flat disk (known as a &quot;lap&quot;) for the purpose of cutting or polishing. Diamond abrasives bonded to metal or resin are typically used for cutting laps, and a wide variety of materials are used for polishing laps in conjunction with either very fine diamond powder or oxide-based polishes. Water is typically used for cutting, while either oil or water is used for the polishing process.

The machine uses a system generally called a &quot;mast&quot; which consists of an angle readout, height adjustment and typically a gear (called an &quot;index gear&quot;) with a particular number of teeth is used as a means of setting the rotational angle. The angles of rotation are evenly divided by the number of teeth present on the gear, though many machines include additional means of adjusting the rotational angle in finer increments, often called a &quot;cheater&quot;. The stone is bonded to a (typically metal) rod known as a &quot;dop&quot; or &quot;dop stick&quot; and is held in place by part of the mast referred to as the &quot;quill&quot;.

=== The modern faceting process ===
The dopped stone is ground at precise angles and indexes on cutting laps of progressively finer grit, and then the process is repeated a final time to polish each facet. Accurate repetition of angles in the cutting and polishing process is aided by the angle readout and index gear. The physical process of polishing is a subject of debate. One commonly accepted theory is that the fine abrasive particles of a polishing compound produce abrasions smaller than the wavelengths of light, thus making the minute scratches invisible. Since gemstones have two sides (the crown and pavilion), a device often called a &quot;transfer jig&quot; is used to flip the stone so that each side may be cut and polished.

=== Other methods ===

&quot;Cleaving&quot; relies on planar weaknesses of the chemical bonds in the crystal structure of a mineral. If a sharp blow is applied at the correct angle, the stone may split cleanly apart. While cleaving is sometimes used to split uncut gemstones into smaller pieces, it is never used to produce facets. Cleaving of diamonds was once common, but as the risk of damaging a stone is too high, undesirable diamond pieces often resulted. The preferred method of splitting diamonds into smaller pieces is now sawing.

An older and more primitive style of faceting machine called a jamb peg machine used wooden dop sticks of precise length and a &quot;mast&quot; system consisting of a plate with holes carefully placed in it. By placing the back end of the dop into one of the many holes, the stone could be introduced to the lap at precise angles. These machines took considerable skill to operate effectively.

Another method of facet cutting involves the use of cylinders to produce curved, concave facets. This technique can produce many unusual and artistic variations of the traditional faceting process.

== Natural faceting ==
Many crystals naturally grow in faceted shapes. For instance, common table salt forms cubes and quartz forms hexagonal prisms. These characteristic shapes are a consequence of the crystal structure of the material and the surface energy, as well as the general conditions under which the crystal formed.
The Bravais lattice of the crystal structure defines a set of possible &quot;low-energy planes&quot;, which are usually planes on which the atoms are close-packed. For instance, a cubic crystal may have low-energy planes on the faces of the cube or on the diagonals. The planes are low-energy in the sense that if the crystal is cleaved along these planes, there will be relatively few broken bonds and a relatively small increase in energy over the unbroken crystal. Equivalently, these planes have a low surface energy. The planes with the lowest energy will form the largest facets, in order to minimize the overall thermodynamic free energy of the crystal. If the surface energy as a function of the planes is known, the equilibrium shape of the crystal may be found via the Wulff construction.

Growth conditions, including the surface the crystal is growing on top of (the substrate), may change the expected shape of the crystal; for instance, if the base of the crystal is under stress from the substrate, this may favor the crystal growing taller rather than growing outwards along the substrate. The surface energy, including the relative energies of the different planes, depend on many factors including the temperature, the composition of the surroundings (e.g. humidity), and the pressure.

<text>Photoplay was one of the first American film fan magazines, its title another word for screenplay. It was founded in Chicago in 1911. Under early editors, Julian Johnson and James R. Quirk, in style and reach it became a pacesetter for fan magazines. In 1921, &quot;Photoplay&quot; established what is considered the first significant annual movie award. For most of its run, it was published by Macfadden Publications. The magazine ceased publication in 1980.

==History==
&quot;Photoplay&quot; began as a short fiction magazine concerned mostly with the plots and characters of films at the time and was used as a promotional tool for those films. In 1915, Julian Johnson and James R. Quirk became the editors (though Quirk had been vice president of the magazine since its inception), and together they created a format which would set a precedent for almost all celebrity magazines that followed. By 1918 the circulation exceeded 200,000, with the popularity of the magazine fueled by the public&#x27;s increasing interest in the private lives of celebrities.

==Popularity==

&quot;Photoplay&quot; reached its apex in the 1920s and 1930s, and was considered quite influential within the motion picture industry. The magazine was renowned for its artwork portraits of film stars, by such artists as Earl Christy and Charles Sheldon, on the cover. Macfadden Publications purchased the magazine in 1934. With the advance of color photography, by 1937 the magazine instead began using photographs of the stars.

&quot;Photoplay&quot; published the writings of Lillian Day, Sheilah Graham, Hedda Hopper, Dorothy Kilgallen, Hazel MacDonald, Louella Parsons, Adela Rogers St. Johns, Rob Wagner (later the editor and publisher of &quot;Script&quot;), and Walter Winchell, among others. The magazine was edited by Quirk until 1932; later editors include Kathryn Dougherty, Ruth Waterbury, and Adele Whiteley Fletcher. It also featured the health and beauty advice of Sylvia of Hollywood, arguably the first fitness guru to the stars.

Sidney Skolsky, a nationally syndicated gossip columnist for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and later the &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot;, had a regular column in &quot;Photoplay&quot; called &quot;From A Stool At Schwab&#x27;s&quot;, the Hollywood drugstore he made famous; such was the magazine&#x27;s popularity.
==The &quot;Photoplay&quot; Magazine Medal of Honor==

In 1921 &quot;Photoplay&quot; established what is considered the first significant annual movie award, the &quot;Photoplay&quot; Magazine Medal of Honor. An actual medallion produced by Tiffany &amp; Co., it was voted on by the readers of the magazine and given to the producer of the year&#x27;s best film, chosen with an emphasis on (according to Quirk) &quot;the ideals and motives governing its production... the worth of its dramatic message.&quot; Though &quot;Photoplay&quot; only gave the single award for best film, its intentions and standards were influential on the Academy Awards founded later in the decade, and they overlap on Best Picture choices to some extent, though increasingly in the 1930s &quot;Photoplay&quot;″s choices reflected its primarily female readership. By 1939 the Medal of Honor had declined in importance, and the award was discontinued that year.

From 1944 to 1968, &quot;Photoplay&quot; awarded a Gold Medal for film of the year based on polling done by George Gallup&#x27;s Audience Research Inc. through the 1950s, and then voted on by the magazine&#x27;s readers. It also awarded Most Popular Male Star and Most Popular Female Star based on actors&#x27; and actresses&#x27; popularity, not their performance. The awards were based on polling through the 1950s, and then on a vote by the readers, similar to the Gold Medal. Bing Crosby and Greer Garson were frequently named the most popular film stars during the 1940s and later winners of the title included James Stewart, Jane Wyman, Alan Ladd, Marilyn Monroe, Rock Hudson, and Kim Novak. Most popular television stars were also named in the 1960s. In 1948, the &quot;Photoplay Awards&quot; were broadcast on network television as part of &quot;The Steve Allen Plymouth Show&quot;.

Additionally, in September 1921, &quot;Photoplay&quot; began designating a handful of movies each month as the Best Pictures of the Month, providing a window into contemporary opinion at a time when movie coverage was not as extensive as it later became. The initial set of selections in the September 1921 issue were: 

* &quot;The Conquering Power&quot;
* &quot;The Old Nest&quot;
* &quot;The Affairs of Anatol&quot;
* &quot;Experience&quot;
* &quot;Doubling for Romeo&quot;

In January 1923, &quot;Photoplay&quot; also added the category Best Performances of the Month. The initial selections for this award were: 

==Mergers and closure==
&quot;Photoplay&quot; merged with another fan magazine, &quot;Movie Mirror&quot;, in 1941; and with &quot;TV-Radio Mirror&quot; in 1977, when the name became &quot;Photoplay and TV Mirror&quot;.

The magazine published its final issue on April 15, 1980. In a sign of changing times, the cover photo featured not movie stars but two television actresses, Victoria Principal and Charlene Tilton. The skeleton staff of six people were all transferred to &quot;Us&quot; magazine, which Macfadden Publications had recently acquired. The president of Macfadden, Peter J. Callahan, said the decision to cease publication was made &quot;very reluctantly&quot;, but also added the bald observation that &quot;the day of the traditional movie magazine is over&quot;.

A British version of &quot;Photoplay&quot; debuted in March 1950, and in April 1981 it was rebranded as &quot;Photoplay: Movies and Video&quot;. It featured an equal mix of American and British films and stars, and ceased publication in 1989.

<doc id="418146" wikidata="Q151678" url="?curid=418146" title="Rita Repulsa">
<text>Rita Repulsa is a character from the television series &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, and the principal nemesis of the superhero protagonists in the show&#x27;s first season. She is portrayed in the first season by Machiko Soga (via Zyuranger footage as Witch Bandora) and by Carla Perez in the remaining seasons, while voiced by Barbara Goodson in the series. Soga reprised her role as Rita, now the Mystic Mother, while Susan Brady provided her voice in the TV series &quot;Power Rangers Mystic Force&quot;. In the films, she is portrayed by Julia Cortez in &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;, and by Elizabeth Banks in the 2017 reboot film. Rita Repulsa is based on the &quot;Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger&quot; villain Witch Bandora.

==Character attributes==
===Origins===
Rita Repulsa is an evil space witch bent on ruling the universe. Being a powerful sorceress, Rita has conquered many worlds and amassed a large collection of monsters and Putty Patrollers to do her bidding. During her reign of terror, she led a group of minions to conquer Earth.

Imprisoned in a space dumpster by a sage named Zordon, Rita was cast into space where she would float for ten thousand years before arcing back to the Moon in 1993. Once freed by two astronauts, she and her minions reclaimed their headquarters and started a second campaign on Earth to defeat Zordon and take the planet for Lord Zedd. She is the first major villain of the Power Rangers franchise.

===Appearance and personality===
Most discernible by her two pointed hair cones, one may also recognize her by her screeching voice, Madonna-like cone bra, and obnoxious attitude. She is sarcastic and power hungry, her character would usually become humorous whenever the Power Rangers defeated her; this would usually end with the catchphrase &quot;I&#x27;ve got such a headache!&quot; As Rita then married Lord Zedd later on in the series, her humorous personality was increased (usually arguing with Zedd or her father, Master Vile).

Rita is sometimes seen arguing with her younger brother, Rito, whose skeletal appearance was comically revealed on her account. He knew she was picky in gifts being given to her. Rita wanted a nice little planet to take over and Rito offended her by giving her a fire-breathing dragon instead. She used the dragon to attack him and burn their parents house to prove her point.

Years after several defeats across the Universe, Rita was turned away from evil thanks to Zordon&#x27;s Good energy wave. Rita then adopted a new title, Mystic Mother, and began to practice good magic. While confronted by evil, Mystic Mother proved stronger and was able to aid the Power Rangers Mystic Force in eradicating dark magic.

===Powers===
Being a powerful witch, Rita possessed many magical abilities. By far the most common demonstration of her power was her use of her &quot;wand&quot; (actually an ornate staff) to make her monsters and minions grow to enormous sizes. Rita has also used magical rituals to control humans to do her bidding and even turn them evil, at least temporarily (Tommy Oliver and Katherine Hillard being the most prominent examples). She can also trap people in other dimensions and shoot energy blasts, like most villains from the &quot;Zordon era&quot;, teleport at will, though only at relatively short range (i.e., from the Moon to Earth and back, but not from Earth to another planet). Rita was also able to create her own Power Ranger, but she accomplished this by simply giving a Power Coin to an individual she had brainwashed to be evil, rather than facilitate a connection to the Morphing Grid herself.

In the 2006 series &quot;Power Rangers Mystic Force&quot; she is the ruler of all good magic and can use that magic to defend herself if and when she needs to. She is also capable of facilitating a connection to the Universal Morphing Grid to create a full team of Power Rangers if necessary, hence the Mystic Force. As the Mystic Mother, Rita takes a behind-the-scenes role, ensuring the flow of good magic throughout the world rather than using it herself, unless she has no other choice.

===Portrayals===
The character of Rita Repulsa was portrayed by multiple actresses. Since the character was created from footage of the Witch Bandora from the original Japanese series &quot;Zyuranger&quot;, she was portrayed by Machiko Soga and dubbed in English by Barbara Goodson. Goodson continued to voice the role until &quot;Power Rangers in Space&quot; in 1998. Carla Perez took over the visual portrayal from Soga when the character was reintroduced midway through &quot;Mighty Morphin&quot; second season in 1994, portraying her from 1994 until &quot;Power Rangers in Space&quot; in 1998, and Julia Cortez portrayed the character in the 1995 film &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;. In 2006, the character was reintroduced as Mystic Mother in &quot;Power Rangers Mystic Force&quot;, again portrayed by Soga, this time with Susan Brady providing her voice. Elizabeth Banks portrayed a reimagined Rita in the 2017 reboot film. Goodson returned to voice Rita in 2021 for her playable appearance in &quot;Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid&quot;.

==Synopsis==
===&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;===
In &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, Rita was born to Master Vile and Lady Fienna and had a younger brother named Rito Revolto. At one point, her parents got her a fire breathing dragon when she wanted a &quot;cute little planet&quot; instead. Rita then used the dragon to burn down their house. At some point, Rita began working for Lord Zedd in his attempts at conquering the universe. She served as his regent while he was elsewhere. However, Zordon and his army opposed her. Rita managed to steal and corrupt the Dragon Coin. However, Zordon eventually managed to seal Rita and her minions in a space dumpster, though Rita manages to trap Zordon in a time warp.

====Season 1====
At the beginning of season 1, Rita Repulsa had been imprisoned for over ten thousand years in the space dumpster. She, along with the other season 1 villains, were unknowingly released by a pair of Earth astronauts. She exited the dumpster along with her minions Goldar, Baboo &amp; Squatt, and Finster. Rita claimed she would conquer the first planet she saw after being freed, which unsurprisingly happened to be Earth. Over the course of the show, Rita Repulsa battled the Power Rangers using everything from phobia spells, super Putty Patrollers, binding magic spells, and on occasion, she would even allow the likes of Goldar, Squatt, and Baboo to be &quot;in charge&quot; of destroying the Power Rangers. All of their plans failed, and Rita would normally take her frustrations out on her henchmen by bashing them on the head with her magic wand or yelling in their faces. One of Rita&#x27;s most memorable traits was that following each loss, she would either swear vengeance or complain that she had a headache (the latter becoming one of her trademarks).

====Season 2====

In season 2, Rita&#x27;s reign of terror came to an end when Lord Zedd returned to assume control. Then it is revealed Rita was not the true empress, but actually the regent of Zedd&#x27;s empire while he was off in other places. Zedd was furious that Rita had failed to defeat &quot;children&quot; and conquer the Earth, even when Rita warned him about Zordon. Despite Rita&#x27;s begging and pleading, Lord Zedd vaporized Rita&#x27;s magic wand and shrank her down to the size of a toy before again exiling her into space in a space dumpster. Locked within a space dumpster, Rita came within inches of freedom when her dumpster came to Earth, and Bulk and Skull succeeded in opening the dumpster. But the Power Rangers were successful in sending Rita back into space. Eventually, her dumpster crashed into the Moon, and she escaped. Down but not out, after regaining her freedom, Rita sought assistance from Finster, her still loyal henchman, to concoct a love potion that would generate libidic feelings for use on Lord Zedd. She also used a beauty cream made by Finster over her face to become younger (serving to transition the actress from Soga to Perez). The love potion worked and the two were then married. Once married to Lord Zedd, Rita eventually gave up her magic practices and worked alongside Lord Zedd as a partner in crime. With Zedd by Rita&#x27;s side, they are more powerful together and attempted to defeat the Rangers. Though they each failed, the Rangers did not claim victory so easily as the result of how efficacious their enemies have become.

====Season 3====
In season 3, Shortly after the wedding, Rita&#x27;s brother, Rito Revolto, arrived to join his sister and brother-in-law on their quest to destroy the Power Rangers. Following this, crossing their staffs, Rita and Zedd were able to make monsters grow by the power of lightning. Nevertheless, they continued to fail, even with help from Rita&#x27;s spy, Katherine Hillard, who, after breaking free from Rita&#x27;s control, joined the forces of the Power Rangers as the second Pink Ranger when Kimberly Hart departed for Florida. Additionally, Goldar found out about the love potion that Rita used on Lord Zedd and had a concoction created to reverse the effects. The anti-love potion brought Zedd back to normal. However, he had apparently developed a real love for Rita of his own accord.

Later still, her father, Master Vile, made his entrance and enraged over Rita&#x27;s marriage to Lord Zedd, yells at her. He later aids the villains greatly by leaving the Rangers as powerless children. However, the Alien Rangers arrive to assist Zordon and foiling his plans. Rita is embarrassed to see Master Vile throwing a tantrum like child and tells him to stop doing that. Master Vile decides to leave much to her embarrassment and Zedd&#x27;s pleasure.

===&quot;Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers&quot;===
In &quot;Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers&quot;, Rita&#x27;s father turned back time using the Orb of Doom. As a result the Alien Rangers were summoned from Aquitar, working to protect Earth from Rita and Zedd&#x27;s forces until the de-aged Rangers could acquire the Zeo Crystal and use it to turn time back to normal. During this story arc, the villains were successful in destroying the power coins and planting an explosive device within the catacombs of the Command Center and once the Zeo sub crystals were all reassembled set off the device believing that they had finally destroyed Zordon, Alpha and the Power Rangers. They however lost contact with Rito and Goldar who they believed escaped the destruction of the Command Center with the Zeo Crystal.

===&quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;===
In &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;, despite their apparent victory, Rita and Zedd were forced to flee to live in refuge with Master Vile following the arrival of the Machine Empire. However, the couple, along with the other villains, returned to the moon in a motorhome and throughout the latter part of &quot;Zeo&quot;. Rita and Zedd attempted to thwart the Machine Empire&#x27;s plots and even aided the Rangers to prevent the Machine Empire from claiming Earth. In &quot;Rangers of Two Worlds, Part 1&quot;, Finster made a new staff for Rita, which is much stronger than before. She had planned to make Katherine into a monster, but due to Goldar and Rito squabbling over seating arrangements, their fighting unwittingly veered the motorhome off target and created Impursonator from her ugly purse. Despite its harmless form, she ended up being one of Rita&#x27;s most powerful monsters created and even deflecting hits from the Zeo Ultrazord. After King Mondo and his family are defeated by the Power Rangers, Zedd and Rita gave Prince Sprocket a present, claimed as a peace offering, which was actually a bomb, which blows the Royal House of Gadgetry to pieces. Zedd and Rita are seen driving away victoriously in their motorhome, while King Mondo swears revenge on the two.

===&quot;Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie&quot;===
Rita and Zedd made a small cameo appearance in &quot;&quot;. Divatox calls them in the middle of the night to ask them how to destroy the Rangers. In a comical scene, Rita held the phone to a snoring Zedd, saying that if she knew how to stop the Rangers she would not be listening to that, and then told Divatox her advice was to run.

===&quot;Power Rangers Turbo&quot;===
In the &quot;Power Rangers Turbo&quot; episode &quot;The Millennium Message&quot;, the Blue Senturion plays a video message from the future foretelling of Dark Specter&#x27;s alliance and their attack on the galaxy. Shown working together and causing destruction are Rita, Zedd, Mondo, Machina and Divatox.

===&quot;Power Rangers in Space&quot;===
In &quot;Power Rangers in Space&quot;, Rita and Zedd joined the alliance of villains led by Dark Specter, and assisted with Dark Specter&#x27;s scheme to vanquish all good in the universe. In the first episode, Rita competes with Divatox for the task of pursuing Andros, the Red Space Ranger who has infiltrated the meeting of villains. During Dark Specter&#x27;s final assault, Zedd and Rita were assigned to conquer a Planet in the Vica Galaxy that was defended by Trey of Triforia, the Gold Zeo Ranger. During the final confrontation in &quot;Countdown to Destruction, Part 2&quot; when Zordon sacrificed his own life, it caused an energy wave that destroyed the invaders and purified the villains into humans. Rita was transformed into a normal human, who swiftly expressed delight that Lord Zedd had also been transformed. They were seen dancing happily, while the bemused Trey watches on with relief.

===&quot;Power Rangers Mystic Force&quot;===

In &quot;Power Rangers Mystic Force&quot;, viewers learn that Rita has become the Mystic Mother, Empress of Good Magic and leader of the Mystic Ones. She is the one who apparently gave the Power Rangers Mystic Force their link to the Morphing Grid. When she learns that the Master is about to assault the Mystic Mother&#x27;s fortress, Udonna mentions that she was &quot;known as Rita in the dark days&quot;. It is the Mystic Mother who gives Clare the powers of a full sorceress and helps the Mystic Rangers to defeat the Master of Darkness—in typical Rita fashion, she accuses the Master of giving her a headache.

Note that the characters were unrelated in the original Japanese &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series, even though they were both played by Machiko Soga (she was one of many actors in the original franchise who played unrelated characters in different seasons). The writers decided to connect the characters both as an Easter egg for long-time fans and as a tribute to Soga herself, who died while &quot;Mystic Force&quot; was in production.

===&quot;Power Rangers Operation Overdrive&quot;===
In the &quot;Power Rangers Operation Overdrive&quot; 15th special anniversary episode, &quot;Once A Ranger&quot;, Zedd and Rita&#x27;s previously unknown son, Thrax, confront the Overdrive Rangers. Thrax united the current team&#x27;s various enemies and severed their connection to the Morphing Grid. In response, the Sentinel Knight assembles a team of veteran Rangers to defeat Thrax. Adam, the new team&#x27;s leader, mentions his previous battles with Zedd and Rita and observes that Thrax will be difficult to defeat. When he later mentions Rita&#x27;s change of allegiance, Thrax mocks his mother&#x27;s decision to embrace good after Zordon&#x27;s wave purified her.

===&quot;Power Rangers Beast Morphers&quot;===
Rita is mentioned and made a cameo in the footage in the &quot;Power Rangers Beast Morphers&quot; episode &quot;Making Bad.&quot; She is shown in the footage of Lord Zedd when Scrozzle suggested that they use the Re-Animizer on Lord Zedd&#x27;s staff.

===&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot;===
In the anniversary film &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot;, Billy Cranston, in an attempt to revive Zordon, accidentally collects the evil that was blasted off of Rita by the Z-Wave. This evil possesses the body of Alpha 8, becoming a new version of the villainess called Robo-Rita. The revived witch unleashes an army of Putties and creates robot versions of Mighty Minotaur and Snizzard to serve her. She murders Trini Kwan in battle when Trini intercepts a blast meant for Billy, causing Trini&#x27;s daughter Minh to swear vengeance. Later, she captures Tommy Oliver, Kimberly Hart, Jason Lee Scott, and Rangers from other teams and imprisons them in a machine that drains their energy. Her plan is eventually revealed that she will use the energy to power a time portal so she can help her past self kill the Power Rangers before Zordon can recruit them. Minh intercepts a blast meant for Billy, but survives and successfully morphs. The remaining Rangers defeat her minions and Minh and Zack Taylor destroy Robo-Rita, putting an end to the evil of Rita Repulsa.

===&quot;Power Rangers Cosmic Fury&quot;===
In the finale of &quot;Power Rangers Cosmic Fury&quot;, an evil copy of Lord Zedd is defeated by being placed in an eternal dream of being endlessly nagged by Rita.

==In other media==
===&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;===

In &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;, Rita, Zedd, Goldar, and Mordant arrive on earth at the constructive site and crack open a giant egg releasing Ivan Ooze after 6,000 years, a morphological being who ruled earth with an iron fist before he was overthrown by Zordon and a group of young warriors. Ivan usurps Rita and Zedd, trapping them in a snow globe. In a mid-credits scene, Goldar briefly lounges in Zedd&#x27;s throne being served by Mordant only to panic when Zedd and Rita appear having been released after Ivan was destroyed.

===&quot;Power Rangers (2017 film)&quot;===
Rita Repulsa appears in &quot;Power Rangers&quot;, portrayed by Elizabeth Banks. Rita is the former Green Ranger, with her character now seeking to harness the Ranger&#x27;s power source. An apparent former member of Zordon&#x27;s Ranger team, Rita betrayed them to acquire the power of the Zeo Crystal, the source of all life on Earth, killing the rest of the team until Zordon buried the Power Coins and had Alpha hide his location with a meteor that blasted Rita into the ocean and seriously damaged her armor. She is brought up in the present day by a fishing boat captained by Sam Scott, Jason&#x27;s father, and soon sets about gathering gold to replenish her power with the goal of unleashing Goldar, a massive monster who will allow her to acquire the Crystal. After the Rangers are forced to confront her directly despite not having mastered their powers, she kills Billy after she forces him to reveal the location of the Crystal, which is underneath the Krispy Kreme doughnut shop, but Zordon and the other Rangers are able to revive him, at the cost of sacrificing Zordon&#x27;s chance to come back to life himself. The Rangers subsequently face Goldar in battle with the Zords, but only gain the upper hand when they form the Megazord. Despite Rita merging with Goldar to take charge of the fight, the Rangers are finally able to defeat her and destroy Goldar. They offer her the chance to surrender and hand over the green Power Coin, but she instead tries to attack them again, only to be &#x27;slapped&#x27; into the sky by Jason. She is last shown drifting in space towards the Moon, smiling in satisfaction as her body freezes.

<doc id="418147" wikidata="Q2309524" url="?curid=418147" title="King Lud">
<text>Lud (), according to Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudohistorical &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; and related medieval texts, was a king of Britain in pre-Roman times who founded London and was buried at Ludgate. He was the eldest son of Geoffrey&#x27;s King Heli, and succeeded his father to the throne. He was succeeded, in turn, by his brother Cassibelanus (). Lud may be connected with the Welsh mythological figure Lludd Llaw Eraint, earlier Nudd Llaw Eraint, cognate with the Irish Nuada Airgetlám, a king of the Tuatha Dé Danann, and the Brittonic god Nodens. However, he was a separate figure in Welsh tradition and is usually treated as such.

==In literature==
Lud&#x27;s reign is notable for the building of cities and the refortification of Trinovantum (London), which he especially loved. Geoffrey explained the name &quot;London&quot; as deriving from &quot;Caer Lud&quot;, or Lud&#x27;s Fortress. When he died, he was buried at Ludgate. His two sons, Androgeus and Tenvantius, were not yet of age, so he was succeeded by his brother Cassibelanus.

In the Welsh versions of Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;, usually called &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot;, he is called Lludd fab Beli, establishing the connection to the early mythological Lludd Llaw Eraint. An independent Welsh tale, &quot;Cyfranc Lludd a Llefelys&quot; (&quot;The Tale of Lludd and Llefelys&quot;), is appended into some versions of the &quot;Brut&quot;. It also survives independently, and in this form was included in the collection known as the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. According to this tale, Lludd had an additional brother named Llefelys, who became king of France while Lludd ruled in Britain. During Lludd&#x27;s reign, three great plagues befell Britain, but he was able to overcome them with the advice of his brother.

==King Lud in the City of London==
Lud&#x27;s name was claimed by Geoffrey of Monmouth to be the origin of Ludgate (named &quot;Porth Llydd&quot; in the &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot;), a major gateway into the City of London, as well as of the name of London itself. (The true etymology of &quot;Ludgate&quot; is from the Old English term &quot;hlid-geat&quot;, a common Old English compound meaning &quot;postern&quot; or &quot;swing gate&quot;.)

16th-century statues of King Lud and his two sons, which formerly stood on the gate, now stand in the vestry porch of St Dunstan-in-the-West on Fleet Street, in a state of disrepair. There was a pub at Ludgate Circus called &quot;King Lud&quot;, now an outlet of the chain restaurant Leon, and medallions of King Lud may be seen up on its roofline and over the doors.

<text>Birdo, known in Japanese as Catherine (キャサリン, &quot;Kyasarin&quot;, ) is a character in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mario&quot; franchise. Her first appearance was as a boss character in &quot;Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic&quot; (1987), which was localized for English-language audiences as &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; (1988). Since then, Birdo has been a recurring character in various &quot;Mario&quot; franchise games making several cameo and playable appearances.

The English manual for &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; describes Birdo as a character who &quot;thinks he is a girl&quot; and would prefer to be called Birdetta. Nintendo has generally avoided commenting on Birdo&#x27;s gender in games released after her debut, though some games, such as &quot;Captain Rainbow&quot; (2008), do discuss her gender. She has made several appearances in other media as well as in promotional material for the series.

== Concept and creation ==
Birdo is a pink, anthropomorphic dinosaur-like creature who wears a red hairbow and has a round mouth that can fire eggs as projectiles. Birdo&#x27;s name was mistakenly switched with another &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; (1988) enemy, Ostro, in the game&#x27;s end credits and its instruction manual.

The Japanese manual for &quot;Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic&quot; (1987) states her name to be Catherine and is a male who thinks of himself as female. Text in the first edition manual for the North American release of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; stated that Birdo would &quot;rather be called &#x27;Birdetta and &quot;he thinks he is a girl&quot;. Due to this, she is widely considered to be one of the first transgender characters in video games. In later printings, mention of Birdo being male was omitted. Mention of this fact is further not included in most later games featuring the character. Birdo has been variously referred to as male, female, and of indeterminate gender in her various re-appearances. Birdo has additionally been voiced with both feminine and masculine voices in different mediums. Birdo appears in the Wii game &quot;Captain Rainbow&quot; (2008) which delves into Birdo&#x27;s gender identity. Due to conflicting sources regarding her gender, her gender identity has been of some debate among gamers, and though Birdo has been &quot;increasingly feminized&quot; as the series progressed, the depiction of Birdo&#x27;s gender has fluctuated wildly across various media.

== Appearances ==
Birdo is a character in the &quot;Mario&quot; video game franchise. She made her first appearance in the Family Computer Disk System video game &quot;Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic&quot; (1987). The game was later localized for Western audiences in the form of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; (1988). In the game, she acts as a boss opponent.

Birdo has made frequent appearances in later &quot;Mario&quot; games, acting as a boss opponent in games such as &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; (1996), and &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga&quot; (2003)&quot;.&quot; She is a playable character in various &quot;Mario&quot; sports games, including games such as &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; (2000) &quot;Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour,&quot; (2003) &quot;Mario Tennis Aces&quot;, (2018) and &quot;Mario Strikers: Battle League&quot; (2022). Birdo additionally acted as a playable character several times in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series of racing games. She has had roles in other &quot;Mario&quot; franchise games, such as the puzzle video game &quot;Wario&#x27;s Woods&quot; (1994)&quot;.&quot; She also cameos as an unlockable costume for Mario in the video game &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot; (2015), and appears in the RPG game &quot;Paper Mario: The Origami King&quot; (2020) as part of an in-universe stage play.

Birdo additionally appears in &quot;Captain Rainbow&quot; (2008), where she is one of the many &quot;B-List&quot; Nintendo characters who inhabit the game&#x27;s main location, Mimin Island. In the game, Birdo is imprisoned for using the women&#x27;s bathroom, and needs Captain Rainbow to retrieve her vibrator in order to prove that she is a woman. This is the last time Birdo&#x27;s gender history was mentioned in a video game.

== Reception ==
Though the manual excerpt from &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; about Birdo&#x27;s gender did not receive attention until some time after the game&#x27;s release, Birdo has been the subject of discussion relating to her gender identity, being credited as an example of transgender character in video games, and as an example of an early transgender character in videogames. She has been described as a transgender icon due to her perceived gender identity. Numerous petitions from fans have called for Nintendo to recognize the transgender status of the character. Jake Hall of &quot;TechRadar&quot; described Birdo&#x27;s ongoing popularity in online communities, noting how Birdo&#x27;s status as a transgender icon stemmed from the fact that Birdo served as a comforting character sought out by transgender communities in order to have a visible icon, stating that it helped to celebrate how transgender communities have always existed. Sam Greer, writing for &quot;GamesRadar+&quot;, was critical of Birdo&#x27;s portrayal, stating that her gender had become a &quot;running joke&quot; and was the &quot;subject of much derision and stereotyping.&quot; The book &quot;100 Greatest Video Game Characters&quot; analyzed Birdo&#x27;s storyline in &quot;Captain Rainbow&quot; and how it represented the struggles of transgender people in real life for proper representation. They stated that by showing how Birdo was accepted as female by the characters of the &quot;Mario&quot; universe, it emphasized hope for proper inclusion and representation in the real world. However, it criticized how, by proving Birdo was female in &quot;Captain Rainbow&quot;&#x27;s story, and via how Birdo had to partake in stereotypically feminine actions in order to be accepted as female, it reinforced the concept of gender being a forced binary choice on transgender people, instead of transgender people being allowed to make the choice of who they were for themselves.

Stacey Henley of &quot;TheGamer&quot; stated that Birdo was a highly important character for transgender representation, as she represented the struggles and stereotypes of transgender people in real life. She described how Nintendo seemed &quot;ashamed of Birdo&#x27;s past&quot; and that despite Nintendo&#x27;s disinterest, Birdo was described as a &quot; landmark piece of representation&quot; within the transgender community that acted &quot;[as] a metaphor for the community&#x27;s own representation on screen.&quot; &quot;Paste&quot;″s Jennifer Unkle criticized Birdo as a caricatured trans person and as an example of Nintendo&#x27;s poor handling of gender identity in general. Zackari Greif of &quot;Game Rant&quot; also criticized Nintendo&#x27;s handling of the character, citing multiple occasions where Birdo was referred to with male pronouns instead of female ones, as well as how Birdo is constantly referred to as &quot;Birdo&quot; and not &quot;Birdetta&quot;, which is stated to be Birdo&#x27;s preferred name in the &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; manual. He felt that Birdo needed consistent and proper respectful treatment as a trans woman in the games as a result. The book &quot;Queerness in Play&quot; analyzed how Birdo remained an important and iconic transgender character in video gaming, stating that the ignorance towards Birdo&#x27;s gender in games served as a degree of transphobia. It compared Birdo to androgynous character Kirby, comparing how Kirby&#x27;s lack of gender-related signifiers made him a comforting character who was &quot;superior to humanity&quot;, while Birdo&#x27;s embracement of them led to Birdo being viewed as &quot;threatening mystery&quot; due to being more human-like in how she expressed her gender. Author Megan Blythe Adams found Nintendo&#x27;s differing interpretation of Birdo&#x27;s gender to be an echo of the cultural contexts in media in Japan; specifically, the new-half phenomena, a media spectacle in Japan that focused on male-to-female transgender sex workers that appeared in media at the time of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;&#x27;s release. They stated that its usage within Birdo&#x27;s character &quot;reinforce[d] the long-standing assumption that transgender performance was something situated in the entertainment world, not in real life.&quot; Lorenzo Fantoni, writing for &quot;Vice&quot;, compared the &quot;Captain Rainbow&quot; scene to the later bathroom debates regarding transgender people. Fantoni also suggested that Nintendo does not know what to do with Birdo, believing that changes to Birdo&#x27;s character were made in order to match present-day morals.

<doc id="418150" wikidata="Q1815870" url="?curid=418150" title="Lud, son of Shem">
<text>Lud ( &quot;Lūḏ&quot;) was a son of Shem and grandson of Noah, according to &quot;Genesis&quot; 10 (the &quot;Table of Nations&quot;).

The descendants of Lud are usually, following Josephus, connected with various Anatolian peoples, particularly Lydia (Assyrian &quot;Luddu&quot;) and their predecessors, the Luwians; cf. Herodotus&#x27; assertion (&quot;Histories&quot; i. 7) that the Lydians were first so named after their king, Lydus (Λυδός). However, the chronicle of Hippolytus of Rome (c. 234 AD) identifies Lud&#x27;s descendants with the &quot;Lazones&quot; or &quot;Alazonii&quot; (names usually taken as variants of the &quot;Halizones&quot; said by Strabo to have once lived along the Halys) while it derives the Lydians from the aforementioned Ludim, son of Mizraim.

The &quot;Book of Jubilees&quot;, in describing how the world was divided between Noah&#x27;s sons and grandsons, says that Lud received &quot;the mountains of Asshur and all appertaining to them till it reaches the Great Sea, and till it reaches the east of Asshur his brother&quot; (Charles translation). The Ethiopian version reads, more clearly &quot;... until it reaches, &quot;toward&quot; the east, toward his brother Asshur&#x27;s portion.&quot; &quot;Jubilees&quot; also says that Japheth&#x27;s son Javan received islands in front of Lud&#x27;s portion, and that Tubal received three large peninsulae, beginning with the first peninsula nearest Lud&#x27;s portion. In all these cases, &quot;Lud&#x27;s portion&quot; seems to refer to the entire Anatolian peninsula, west of Mesopotamia.

Some scholars have associated the Biblical Lud with the &quot;Lubdu&quot; of Assyrian sources, who inhabited certain parts of western Media and Atropatene.

10th century Muslim historian Ali ibn al-Husayn al-Masudi writes in his widely acclaimed historical book &quot;The Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems&quot; that Keyumars, the first king of Persia, was the son of Lud, son of Shem.

The Muslim historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (c. 915) recounts a tradition that the wife of Lud was named Shakbah, daughter of Japheth, and that with him she gave birth to &quot;Faris, Jurjan, and the races of Persia.&quot; He further asserts that Lud was the progenitor of not only the Persians, but also the Amalekites and Canaanites, and all the peoples of the East, Oman, Hejaz, Syria, Egypt, and Bahrain.

Some creationists identify Lud as the progenitor of Haplogroup I-M170.

<doc id="418151" wikidata="Q202501" url="?curid=418151" title="Royal jelly">
<text>Royal jelly is a honey bee secretion that is used in the nutrition of larvae and adult queens. It is secreted from the glands in the hypopharynx of nurse bees, and fed to all larvae in the colony, regardless of sex or caste.

During the process of creating new queens, the workers construct special queen cells. The larvae in these cells are fed with copious amounts of royal jelly. This type of feeding triggers the development of queen morphology, including the fully developed ovaries needed to lay eggs.

Royal jelly is sometimes used in alternative medicine under the category apitherapy. It is often sold as a dietary supplement for humans, but the European Food Safety Authority concluded in 2011 that evidence does not support the claim that consuming royal jelly offers health benefits to humans. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has taken legal action against companies that have marketed royal jelly products using unfounded claims of health benefits.

== Production ==
Royal jelly is secreted from the glands in the heads of worker bees and is fed to all bee larvae, whether they are destined to become drones (males), workers (sterile females), or queens (fertile females). After three days, the drone and worker larvae are no longer fed with royal jelly, but queen larvae continue to be fed this special substance throughout their development.

== Composition ==
Royal jelly is 67% water, 12.5% protein, 11% simple sugars (monosaccharides), 6% fatty acids and 3.5% 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA). It also contains trace minerals, antibacterial and antibiotic components, pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and trace amounts of vitamin C, but none of the fat-soluble vitamins: A, D, E or K.

=== Proteins ===

Major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs) are a family of proteins secreted by honey bees. The family consists of nine proteins, of which MRJP1 (also called royalactin), MRJP2, MRJP3, MRJP4, and MRJP5 are present in the royal jelly secreted by worker bees. MRJP1 is the most abundant, and largest in size. The five proteins constitute 83–90% of the total proteins in royal jelly. They are synthesised by a family of nine genes (&quot;mrjp&quot; genes), which are in turn members of the &quot;yellow&quot; family of genes such as in the fruitfly (&quot;Drosophila&quot;) and bacteria. They are attributed to be involved in differential development of queen larva and worker larvae, thus establishing division of labour in the bee colony.

== Epigenetic effects ==
The honey bee queens and workers represent one of the most striking examples of environmentally controlled phenotypic polymorphism. Even if two larvae had identical DNA, one raised to be a worker, the other a queen, the two adults would be strongly differentiated across a wide range of characteristics including anatomical and physiological differences, longevity, and reproductive capacity. Queens constitute the female sexual caste and have large active ovaries, whereas female workers have only rudimentary, inactive ovaries and are functionally sterile. The queen–worker developmental divide is controlled epigenetically by differential feeding with royal jelly; this appears to be due specifically to the protein royalactin. A female larva destined to become a queen is fed large quantities of royal jelly; this triggers a cascade of molecular events resulting in development of a queen. It has been shown that this phenomenon is mediated by an epigenetic modification of DNA known as CpG methylation. Silencing the expression of an enzyme that methylates DNA in newly hatched larvae led to a royal jelly-like effect on the larval developmental trajectory; the majority of individuals with reduced DNA methylation levels emerged as queens with fully developed ovaries. This finding suggests that DNA methylation in honey bees allows the expression of epigenetic information to be differentially altered by nutritional input.

== Use by humans ==

=== Cultivation ===
Royal jelly is harvested by stimulating colonies with movable frame hives to produce queen bees. Royal jelly is collected from each individual queen cell (honeycomb) when the queen larvae are about four days old. These are the only cells in which large amounts are deposited. This is because when royal jelly is fed to worker larvae, it is fed directly to them, and they consume it as it is produced, while the cells of queen larvae are &quot;stocked&quot; with royal jelly much faster than the larvae can consume it. Therefore, only in queen cells is the harvest of royal jelly practical.

A well-managed hive during a season of 5–6 months can produce approximately of royal jelly. Since the product is perishable, producers must have immediate access to proper cold storage (e.g., a household refrigerator or freezer) in which the royal jelly is stored until it is sold or conveyed to a collection center. Sometimes honey or beeswax is added to the royal jelly, which is thought to aid its preservation.

The Vegetarian Society considers royal jelly to be non-vegan.

=== Adverse effects ===
Royal jelly may cause allergic reactions in humans, ranging from hives or asthma (or both), to even fatal anaphylaxis. The incidence of allergic side effects in people who consume royal jelly is unknown. The risk of having an allergy to royal jelly is higher in people who have other allergies.

<text>In Malaysia, the Governor, officially Yang di-Pertua Negeri (Jawi: , ) is a constitutional title given to the head of state in states without a ruler, namely: Penang, Malacca, Sabah and Sarawak. This is in contrast to a ruler () which is a constitutional title given to states with hereditary monarchies, namely: the Sultans of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Pahang, Perak, Selangor and Terengganu; the Raja of Perlis and the &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Besar&quot; (lit. &#x27;He Who is Made Chief Ruler&#x27;) of Negeri Sembilan.

They are appointed to renewable four-year terms by the &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot; (lit. &#x27;He Who is Made Supreme Ruler&#x27;), the King of Malaysia, after consulting the chief minister or premier.

 functions as the head of state in a parliamentary democracy. Their discretionary roles include appointing the head of government, the chief minister (Malay: &quot;Ketua Menteri)&quot; or premier, who is usually the leader of the party with a majority in the state legislature, and withholding consent to dissolve the state legislature. On all other matters, they must act on the advice of the chief minister/premier, such as appointing the members of the Executive Council in Penang and Malacca, and the Cabinet in Sabah and Sarawak, conferring state honours and granting pardons for offences committed in their state—except pardons for court martial and &quot;syariah&quot; offences, which are granted by the &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot;.

There are two major distinctions between the constitutional roles of the nine hereditary rulers and the four . While the are members of the Conference of Rulers, they cannot participate in the election of the &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot;, discussions related to the privileges of the Malay rulers and matters concerning the observance of Islam. In addition, the does not function as Head of Islam in their states; the role is fulfilled by the &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot;. Stylistically, states with Rulers appoint &quot;menteri besar&quot; (lit. &#x27;chief minister&#x27; in Malay) while the appoint chief ministers or premier of their respective states. This convention was first started with the former Straits Settlements: Penang and Malacca, and subsequently extended to the Borneo States of Sabah and Sarawak. However, in 2022, Sarawak deviated from this convention by changing the title of chief minister to premier to reflect its status as one of the Borneo states which are of a different constitutional position than the States of Malaya as they are asymmetrically accorded more autonomy. This move is similar to how Singapore retained the title of Prime Minister for the head of government (which was first established after it gained self-independence from the United Kingdom in 1959) when it became a state of the Federation as it was the state with the most autonomy. Sabah, as of yet, has not changed the title of chief minister.

Prior to 1976, the heads of state of Penang, Malacca and Sarawak were titled as &quot;Governor&quot; (Malay: &quot;&quot;Gabenor&quot;), whereas the head of state of Sabah was titled &quot;Yang di-Pertua Negara&quot; (lit. &#x27;He Who is Made Leader of the Nation&#x27;) in both languages. Meanwhile, the head of state in Singapore was titled &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Negara&quot;&quot; (lit. &#x27;He Who is Made Ruler of the Nation&#x27; in Malay) in both English and Malay which was also first established after achieving self-independence in 1959.

After the formation of Malaysia in 1963, upon adopting new state constitutions, Sarawak retained the title of Governor passed down from the British colonial rule, Sabah created a new title called the &quot;Yang di-Pertua Negara&quot;, while Singapore retained the title of &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Negara&quot; passed down from the period self-governance.

After the Federation of Malaya achieved independence in 1957, &quot;Governor&quot; referred to the heads of state of the former Straits Settlements, Penang and Malacca. When Malaysia was formed, the previous definition of Governor was extended to the states of Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore in the newly promulgated Federal Constitution. This means that constitutionally speaking, the heads of state in all the states without a Ruler: Penang, Malacca, Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore, were of the same constitutional role, regardless of the style of name. When Singapore was expelled from Malaysia to become an independent republic, the office of &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Negara&quot; was eventually replaced with the office of President.

Since 1976, the style of name for the heads of state of Penang, Malacca, Sabah and Sarawak were made uniform by titling it as .

<text>Basic Training (a.k.a. &quot;Up the Military&quot;) is a 1985 sex comedy film by Andrew Sugerman. It is often considered to be one of the worst films of 1985. While set in Washington, D.C., most of the production was filmed in Los Angeles, including Bob Hope Patriotic Hall. During production the working title was &quot;Up The Pentagon.&quot;

==Plot==
Melinda is a female employee of &quot;The Pentagon&quot;&#x27;s public information service, who loses her job when she refuses to give in to her male superiors&#x27; sexual advances. She then becomes outraged by the Pentagon&#x27;s &quot;un-patriotic&quot; actions, and takes revenge on them by using her physical charms to seduce the top brass into letting her back into the Pentagon. After being re-employed, she sets out to manipulate them to her will and destroy their careers, thus ridding the US government of what she sees as &quot;perverts&quot;, who care more about cheap thrills than national security. She eventually seduces the Russian ambassador into betraying valuable military secrets by offering him among other things &quot;the most scrumptious little breasts&quot; as well as something (left unsaid) which she declares to be the &quot;softest, moistest, sweetest&quot;. In the end she is appointed Secretary of Defense as a reward.

<text>Second quantization, also referred to as occupation number representation, is a formalism used to describe and analyze quantum many-body systems. In quantum field theory, it is known as canonical quantization, in which the fields (typically as the wave functions of matter) are thought of as field operators, in a manner similar to how the physical quantities (position, momentum, etc.) are thought of as operators in first quantization. The key ideas of this method were introduced in 1927 by Paul Dirac, and were later developed, most notably, by Pascual Jordan and Vladimir Fock.
In this approach, the quantum many-body states are represented in the Fock state basis, which are constructed by filling up each single-particle state with a certain number of identical particles. The second quantization formalism introduces the creation and annihilation operators to construct and handle the Fock states, providing useful tools to the study of the quantum many-body theory.

== Quantum many-body states ==

The starting point of the second quantization formalism is the notion of indistinguishability of particles in quantum mechanics. Unlike in classical mechanics, where each particle is labeled by a distinct position vector formula_1 and different configurations of the set of formula_1s correspond to different many-body states, &quot;in quantum mechanics, the particles are identical, such that exchanging two particles, i.e. formula_3, does not lead to a different many-body quantum state&quot;. This implies that the quantum many-body wave function must be invariant (up to a phase factor) under the exchange of two particles. According to the statistics of the particles, the many-body wave function can either be symmetric or antisymmetric under the particle exchange:
:formula_4 if the particles are bosons,
:formula_5 if the particles are fermions.
This exchange symmetry property imposes a constraint on the many-body wave function. Each time a particle is added or removed from the many-body system, the wave function must be properly symmetrized or anti-symmetrized to satisfy the symmetry constraint. In the first quantization formalism, this constraint is guaranteed by representing the wave function as linear combination of permanents (for bosons) or determinants (for fermions) of single-particle states. In the second quantization formalism, the issue of symmetrization is automatically taken care of by the creation and annihilation operators, such that its notation can be much simpler.

=== First-quantized many-body wave function ===
Consider a complete set of single-particle wave functions formula_6 labeled by formula_7 (which may be a combined index of a number of quantum numbers). The following wave function
:formula_8
represents an &quot;N&quot;-particle state with the &quot;i&quot;th particle occupying the single-particle state formula_9. In the shorthanded notation, the position argument of the wave function may be omitted, and it is assumed that the &quot;i&quot;th single-particle wave function describes the state of the &quot;i&quot;th particle. The wave function formula_10 has not been symmetrized or anti-symmetrized, thus in general not qualified as a many-body wave function for identical particles. However, it can be brought to the symmetrized (anti-symmetrized) form by operators formula_11 for symmetrizer, and formula_12 for antisymmetrizer.

For bosons, the many-body wave function must be symmetrized,
:formula_13
while for fermions, the many-body wave function must be anti-symmetrized,
:formula_14
Here formula_15 is an element in the &quot;N&quot;-body permutation group (or symmetric group) formula_16, which performs a permutation among the state labels formula_17, and formula_18 denotes the corresponding permutation sign. formula_19 is the normalization operator that normalizes the wave function. (It is the operator that applies a suitable numerical normalization factor to the symmetrized tensors of degree &quot;n&quot;; see the next section for its value.)

If one arranges the single-particle wave functions in a matrix formula_20, such that the row-&quot;i&quot; column-&quot;j&quot; matrix element is formula_21, then the boson many-body wave function can be simply written as a permanent formula_22, and the fermion many-body wave function as a determinant formula_23 (also known as the Slater determinant).

=== Second-quantized Fock states ===
First quantized wave functions involve complicated symmetrization procedures to describe physically realizable many-body states because the language of first quantization is redundant for indistinguishable particles. In the first quantization language, the many-body state is described by answering a series of questions like &quot;Which particle is in which state?&quot;. However these are not physical questions, because the particles are identical, and it is impossible to tell which particle is which in the first place. The seemingly different states formula_24 and formula_25 are actually redundant names of the same quantum many-body state. So the symmetrization (or anti-symmetrization) must be introduced to eliminate this redundancy in the first quantization description.

In the second quantization language, instead of asking &quot;each particle on which state&quot;, one asks &quot;How many particles are there in each state?&quot;. Because this description does not refer to the labeling of particles, it contains no redundant information, and hence leads to a precise and simpler description of the quantum many-body state. In this approach, the many-body state is represented in the occupation number basis, and the basis state is labeled by the set of occupation numbers, denoted
:formula_26
meaning that there are formula_27 particles in the single-particle state formula_28 (or as formula_29). The occupation numbers sum to the total number of particles, i.e. formula_30. For fermions, the occupation number formula_27 can only be 0 or 1, due to the Pauli exclusion principle; while for bosons it can be any non-negative integer 
:formula_32
The occupation number states formula_33 are also known as Fock states. All the Fock states form a complete basis of the many-body Hilbert space, or Fock space. Any generic quantum many-body state can be expressed as a linear combination of Fock states.

Note that besides providing a more efficient language, Fock space allows for a variable number of particles. As a Hilbert space, it is isomorphic to the sum of the &quot;n&quot;-particle bosonic or fermionic tensor spaces described in the previous section, including a one-dimensional zero-particle space C.

The Fock state with all occupation numbers equal to zero is called the vacuum state, denoted formula_34. The Fock state with only one non-zero occupation number is a single-mode Fock state, denoted formula_35. In terms of the first quantized wave function, the vacuum state is the unit tensor product and can be denoted formula_36. The single-particle state is reduced to its wave function formula_37. Other single-mode many-body (boson) states are just the tensor product of the wave function of that mode, such as formula_38 and
formula_39. For multi-mode Fock states (meaning more than one single-particle state formula_28 is involved), the corresponding first-quantized wave function will require proper symmetrization according to the particle statistics, e.g. formula_41 for a boson state, and formula_42 for a fermion state (the symbol formula_43 between formula_44 and formula_45 is omitted for simplicity). In general, the normalization is found to be formula_46, where &quot;N&quot; is the total number of particles. For fermion, this expression reduces to formula_47 as formula_48 can only be either zero or one. So the first-quantized wave function corresponding to the Fock state reads
:formula_49

for bosons and
:formula_50 
for fermions. Note that for fermions, formula_51 only, so the tensor product above is effectively just a product over all occupied single-particle states.

==Creation and annihilation operators==
The creation and annihilation operators are introduced to add or remove a particle from the many-body system. These operators lie at the core of the second quantization formalism, bridging the gap between the first- and the second-quantized states. Applying the creation (annihilation) operator to a first-quantized many-body wave function will insert (delete) a single-particle state from the wave function in a symmetrized way depending on the particle statistics. On the other hand, all the second-quantized Fock states can be constructed by applying the creation operators to the vacuum state repeatedly.

The creation and annihilation operators (for bosons) are originally constructed in the context of the quantum harmonic oscillator as the raising and lowering operators, which are then generalized to the field operators in the quantum field theory. They are fundamental to the quantum many-body theory, in the sense that every many-body operator (including the Hamiltonian of the many-body system and all the physical observables) can be expressed in terms of them.

=== Insertion and deletion operation ===

The creation and annihilation of a particle is implemented by the insertion and deletion of the single-particle state from the first quantized wave function in an either symmetric or anti-symmetric manner. Let formula_29 be a single-particle state, let 1 be the tensor identity (it is the generator of the zero-particle space C and satisfies formula_53 in the tensor algebra over the fundamental Hilbert space), and let formula_54 be a generic tensor product state. The insertion formula_55 and the deletion formula_56 operators are linear operators defined by the following recursive equations
:formula_57
:formula_58
Here formula_59 is the Kronecker delta symbol, which gives 1 if formula_60, and 0 otherwise. The subscript formula_61 of the insertion or deletion operators indicates whether symmetrization (for bosons) or anti-symmetrization (for fermions) is implemented.

=== Boson creation and annihilation operators ===

The boson creation (resp. annihilation) operator is usually denoted as formula_62 (resp. formula_63). The creation operator formula_62 adds a boson to the single-particle state formula_28, and the annihilation operator formula_63 removes a boson from the single-particle state formula_28. The creation and annihilation operators are Hermitian conjugate to each other, but neither of them are Hermitian operators (formula_68).

==== Definition ====

The boson creation (annihilation) operator is a linear operator, whose action on a &quot;N&quot;-particle first-quantized wave function formula_10 is defined as
:formula_70
:formula_71
where formula_72 inserts the single-particle state formula_29 in formula_74 possible insertion positions symmetrically, and formula_75 deletes the single-particle state formula_29 from formula_77 possible deletion positions symmetrically.

===== Examples =====
Hereinafter the tensor symbol formula_43 between single-particle states is omitted for simplicity. Take the state formula_41, create one more boson on the state formula_44,
:formula_81
Then annihilate one boson from the state formula_44,
:formula_83

==== Action on Fock states ====
Starting from the single-mode vacuum state formula_84, applying the creation operator formula_85 repeatedly, one finds
:formula_86
:formula_87
The creation operator raises the boson occupation number by 1. Therefore, all the occupation number states can be constructed by the boson creation operator from the vacuum state
:formula_88
On the other hand, the annihilation operator formula_89 lowers the boson occupation number by 1
:formula_90
It will also quench the vacuum state formula_91 as there has been no boson left in the vacuum state to be annihilated. Using the above formulae, it can be shown that
:formula_92
meaning that formula_93 defines the boson number operator.

The above result can be generalized to any Fock state of bosons.
:formula_94
:formula_95
These two equations can be considered as the defining properties of boson creation and annihilation operators in the second-quantization formalism. The complicated symmetrization of the underlying first-quantized wave function is automatically taken care of by the creation and annihilation operators (when acting on the first-quantized wave function), so that the complexity is not revealed on the second-quantized level, and the second-quantization formulae are simple and neat.

==== Operator identities ====
The following operator identities follow from the action of the boson creation and annihilation operators on the Fock state,
:formula_96
These commutation relations can be considered as the algebraic definition of the boson creation and annihilation operators. The fact that the boson many-body wave function is symmetric under particle exchange is also manifested by the commutation of the boson operators.

The raising and lowering operators of the quantum harmonic oscillator also satisfy the same set of commutation relations, implying that the bosons can be interpreted as the energy quanta (phonons) of an oscillator. The position and momentum operators of a Harmonic oscillator (or a collection of Harmonic oscillating modes) are given by Hermitian combinations of phonon creation and annihilation operators,
:formula_97
which reproduce the canonical commutation relation between position and momentum operators (with formula_98)
:formula_99
This idea is generalized in the quantum field theory, which considers each mode of the matter field as an oscillator subject to quantum fluctuations, and the bosons are treated as the excitations (or energy quanta) of the field.

=== Fermion creation and annihilation operators ===

The fermion creation (annihilation) operator is usually denoted as formula_100 (formula_101). The creation operator formula_100 adds a fermion to the single-particle state formula_28, and the annihilation operator formula_101 removes a fermion from the single-particle state formula_28.

==== Definition ====

The fermion creation (annihilation) operator is a linear operator, whose action on a &quot;N&quot;-particle first-quantized wave function formula_10 is defined as
:formula_107
:formula_108
where formula_109 inserts the single-particle state formula_29 in formula_74 possible insertion positions anti-symmetrically, and formula_112 deletes the single-particle state formula_29 from formula_77 possible deletion positions anti-symmetrically.

It is particularly instructive to view the results of creation and annihilation operators on states of two (or more) fermions, because they demonstrate the effects of exchange. A few illustrative operations are given in the example below. The complete algebra for creation and annihilation operators on a two-fermion state can be found in &quot;Quantum Photonics&quot;.

===== Examples =====
Hereinafter the tensor symbol formula_43 between single-particle states is omitted for simplicity. Take the state formula_42, attempt to create one more fermion on the occupied formula_44 state will quench the whole many-body wave function,
:formula_118
Annihilate a fermion on the formula_45 state,
take the state formula_42,
:formula_121
The minus sign (known as the fermion sign) appears due to the anti-symmetric property of the fermion wave function.

==== Action on Fock states ====
Starting from the single-mode vacuum state formula_84, applying the fermion creation operator formula_123, 
:formula_124
:formula_125
If the single-particle state formula_28 is empty, the creation operator will fill the state with a fermion. However, if the state is already occupied by a fermion, further application of the creation operator will quench the state, demonstrating the Pauli exclusion principle that two identical fermions can not occupy the same state simultaneously. Nevertheless, the fermion can be removed from the occupied state by the fermion annihilation operator formula_127, 
:formula_128
:formula_129
The vacuum state is quenched by the action of the annihilation operator.

Similar to the boson case, the fermion Fock state can be constructed from the vacuum state using the fermion creation operator
:formula_130
It is easy to check (by enumeration) that
:formula_131
meaning that formula_132 defines the fermion number operator.

The above result can be generalized to any Fock state of fermions.
:formula_133
:formula_134
Recall that the occupation number formula_48 can only take 0 or 1 for fermions. These two equations can be considered as the defining properties of fermion creation and annihilation operators in the second quantization formalism. Note that the fermion sign structure formula_136, also known as the Jordan-Wigner string, requires there to exist a predefined ordering of the single-particle states (the spin structure) and involves a counting of the fermion occupation numbers of all the preceding states; therefore the fermion creation and annihilation operators are considered non-local in some sense. This observation leads to the idea that fermions are emergent particles in the long-range entangled local qubit system.

==== Operator identities ====
The following operator identities follow from the action of the fermion creation and annihilation operators on the Fock state,
:formula_137
These anti-commutation relations can be considered as the algebraic definition of the fermion creation and annihilation operators. The fact that the fermion many-body wave function is anti-symmetric under particle exchange is also manifested by the anti-commutation of the fermion operators.

The creation and annihilation operators are Hermitian conjugate to each other, but neither of them are Hermitian operators (formula_138). The Hermitian combination of the fermion creation and annihilation operators
:formula_139
are called Majorana fermion operators. They can be viewed as the fermionic analog of position and momentum operators of a &quot;fermionic&quot; Harmonic oscillator. They satisfy the anticommutation relation
:formula_140
where formula_141 labels any Majorana fermion operators on equal footing (regardless their origin from Re or Im combination of complex fermion operators formula_101). The anticommutation relation indicates that Majorana fermion operators generates a Clifford algebra, which can be systematically represented as Pauli operators in the many-body Hilbert space.

==Quantum field operators==

Defining formula_143 as a general annihilation (creation) operator for a single-particle state formula_144 that could be either fermionic formula_145 or bosonic formula_146, the real space representation of the operators defines the quantum field operators formula_147 and formula_148 by
:formula_149
:formula_150

These are second quantization operators, with coefficients formula_151 and formula_152 that are ordinary first-quantization wavefunctions. Thus, for example, any expectation values will be ordinary first-quantization wavefunctions. Loosely speaking, formula_148 is the sum of all possible ways to add a particle to the system at position r through any of the basis states formula_154, not necessarily plane waves, as below.

Since formula_147 and formula_148 are second quantization operators defined in every point in space they are called quantum field operators. They obey the following fundamental commutator and anti-commutator relations,

:formula_157 boson fields,
:formula_158 fermion fields.

For homogeneous systems it is often desirable to transform between real space and the momentum representations, hence, the quantum fields operators in Fourier basis yields:
:formula_159
:formula_160

== Comment on nomenclature ==
The term &quot;second quantization&quot;, introduced by Jordan, is a misnomer that has persisted for historical reasons. At the origin of quantum field theory, it was inappositely thought that the Dirac equation described a relativistic wavefunction (hence the obsolete &quot;Dirac sea&quot; interpretation), rather than a classical spinor field which, when quantized (like the scalar field), yielded a fermionic quantum field (vs. a bosonic quantum field).

One is not quantizing &quot;again&quot;, as the term &quot;second&quot; might suggest; the field that is being quantized is not a Schrödinger wave function that was produced as the result of quantizing a particle, but is a classical field (such as the electromagnetic field or Dirac spinor field), essentially an assembly of coupled oscillators, that was not previously quantized. One is merely quantizing each oscillator in this assembly, shifting from a semiclassical treatment of the system to a fully quantum-mechanical one.

<text>Ludim () is the Hebrew term for a people mentioned in Jeremiah and Ezekiel. In the Biblical &quot;Table of Nations&quot; Genesis 10:13 they were descended from Mizraim. The biblical scholar Victor P. Hamilton believes that the available evidence &quot;suggests&quot; that the Ludim are the Lydians.

According to Josephus, their land was in Libya which was west of Egypt near the tribes of Phut in the land of the Moors towards the extreme west of Africa and the Atlantic Ocean. Pliny in his natural history mentions the river Laud along south of the Atlas Mountains near the river Fut (Phut). Medieval biblical exegete Saadia Gaon, identifies the Ludim with &quot;Tanisiin&quot;, and which R. Yosef Qafih thought may have been referring to the inhabitants of Tunis.

These Ludim should not be confused with another group who were said to descend from Lud, son of Shem, son of Noah.

Ludim is sometimes thought to be a scribal error for &quot;Lubim&quot;, in reference to Libyans.

<doc id="418159" wikidata="Q780528" url="?curid=418159" title="Atlus">
<text>is a Japanese video game developer, publisher, arcade manufacturer and distribution company based in Tokyo. A subsidiary of Sega, the company is known for the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot;, &quot;Persona&quot;, &quot;Etrian Odyssey&quot;, and &quot;Trauma Center&quot; series. Its corporate mascot is Jack Frost, a snowman-like character from their &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; series. The company is also known for their &quot;Print Club&quot; arcade machines, which are selfie photo sticker booths in East Asia.

Atlus was established in April 1986 and spent its early years as a video game developer for other companies. It became a video game publisher of its own in 1989 and existed until it was merged into Index Corporation in October 2010. The Atlus name continued as a brand used by Index Corporation for video game publishing until it filed for bankruptcy in June 2013. This company was then acquired by Sega via its new subsidiary Sega Dream Corporation which renamed itself Index Corporation in November 2013. In April 2014, the non-video game assets and the Index name were spun off as a separate subsidiary of Sega, leaving the company with its video game division to be officially renamed Atlus. 

A North American branch of the company, originally Atlus USA and now Atlus West, was founded in 1991 in order to focus on publishing and localizing games for North America. A European branch, handled via the London-based Sega Europe, was founded in 2017.

== History ==

Atlus began on 7 April 1986 as a video game developer of computer games for other companies. In January 1987, Atlus started selling amusement equipment. It expanded into the sale of karaoke equipment in March 1989. Atlus released the first video game under its own name in 1989: &quot;Puzzle Boy&quot; for the Game Boy. Prior to this, earlier Atlus video games were published by other companies, such as Namco and Hudson Soft in Japan and LJN in North America.

Atlus started in the arcade industry in the 1990s by manufacturing its first arcade video game, &quot;BlaZeon&quot;, in 1992. In 1995, Atlus launched &quot;Print Club&quot; (purikura) at arcades in partnership with Sega. It is a photo sticker booth that produces selfie photos. It was conceived by Atlus employee Sasaki Miho in 1994; her bosses at Atlus were initially reluctant about the idea, before later deciding to go ahead with it. Atlus and Sega introduced &quot;Purikura&quot; in February 1995, initially at game arcades, before expanding to other popular culture locations such as fast food shops, train stations, karaoke establishments and bowling alleys. &quot;Purikura&quot; became a popular form of entertainment among youths across East Asia, laying the foundations for modern selfie culture. It also introduced a large female demographic to the company&#x27;s previously male-dominated arcade customer base. By 1996, it accounted for 70% of the company&#x27;s revenue. By 1997, about 47,000 &quot;Purikura&quot; machines had been sold, earning Sega an estimated () or annually from &quot;Purikura&quot; sales that year. Various other similar &quot;purikira&quot; machines appeared from other manufacturers, with Sega controlling about half of the market in 1997. &quot;Print Club&quot; went on to generate over in sales for Atlus and Sega.

Atlus entered the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1997, listing on the JASDAQ. In its goal to further increase its presence in the amusement industry, Atlus acquired the manufacturer Apies from Yubis Corporation in 1999. In 2000, Atlus formed a joint venture with Kadokawa Shoten to distribute and sell games. Atlus suffered from deficit financial results in both 1999 and 2000. To address the issue, Atlus established a management reform plan in 2001. In its restructuring efforts, Atlus sold two subsidiaries (one of them being Apies) to their respective employees as part of a management buyout.

In October 2001, Atlus acquired Career Soft, and became the sole publisher of the &quot;Growlanser&quot; series: a real-time strategy role-playing game from the creators of the &quot;Langrisser&quot; series. In 2004, after the release of &quot;Growlanser IV&quot;, the majority of Career Soft&#x27;s staff was merged into the main development team of Atlus where they worked on the &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor&quot; games. As a developer brand, Career Soft was eventually dissolved.

In October 2003, Japanese toy company Takara acquired Atlus. Takara&#x27;s video game business was also transferred over to Atlus. On 21 November 2006, Index Holdings announced the acquisition of Atlus, effective on 30 October 2006, and purchased 7.7 million shares (54.93 percent; 77,000 votes, or 54.96 percent of the voting rights) on 20 November 2006. Atlus became an Index Holdings subsidiary on 29 November 2006.

In March 2009, Atlus and Sting Entertainment announced a publishing partnership making Atlus the only publisher of Sting-developed games in Japan. On 17 September 2009, Index Holdings announced the separation of Atlus&#x27; amusement facility and related business into a subsidiary, New Entertainment Waves, effective on 1 December. One hundred seventy-two shares of the subsidiary&#x27;s stock were also transferred to Chushoukigyou Leisure on 1 December.

On 30 August 2010, Index Holdings announced its merger with Atlus, with Index Holdings being the surviving company, effective on 1 October. After the merger, Index Holdings would continue to operate the Atlus brand. Although fans were concerned about the company&#x27;s future, CEO Shinichi Suzuki said that Atlus would continue to provide the &quot;finest quality game experiences possible&quot; and the merger &quot;further strengthens the foundation of Atlus, both in Japan and here in the United States.&quot; On 9 November 2010 Index Holdings announced its renaming to Index Corporation, to be confirmed at the shareholders meeting on 25 November 2010 and effective on 1 December.

From 2010 to 2013, Atlus, as a company, ceased to exist and its name became a brand of Index Corporation for video games in Japan. However, Atlus USA remained active and was renamed Index Digital Media, serving as the North American subsidiary for Index Corporation. Much like in Japan, video games continued to be released in that region under the Atlus name during this period. In June 2013, it was reported that Index Corporation filed for civil rehabilitation proceedings, facing bankruptcy with debts of ¥24.5 billion. An Atlus USA spokesperson said that Index Digital Media and the Atlus brand were unaffected by the proceedings.

On 18 September 2013, it was reported that Sega won a bid to acquire the bankrupt Index for ¥14 billion. All Index operations, including the Atlus brand and Index Digital Media (Atlus USA), were transferred on 1 November 2013 to Sega Dream Corporation (a new subsidiary established on 5 September 2013). That day, Sega announced that it would change the name of Sega Dream Corporation to Index Corporation.

On 18 February 2014, Sega announced the separation of Index Corporation&#x27;s contents and solution businesses into a new subsidiary, Index Corporation, renaming the old Index Corporation and its remaining digital game business division to Atlus effective 1 April 2014. The new Atlus would include the foreign subsidiary, Index Digital Media, which would revert its name back to Atlus USA at the establishment of the new Atlus.

In April 2017, Sega Sammy Holdings announced a relocation of head office functions of the Sega Sammy Group and its major domestic subsidiaries located in the Tokyo metropolitan area to Shinagawa-ku by January 2018. Their stated reasoning was to promote cooperation among companies and creation of more active interaction of personnel, while pursuing efficient group management by consolidating scattered head office functions of the group. Atlus is one of the companies that has relocated in response to this.

== Development organization ==
Atlus currently has three internal development divisions inside the company responsible for the development of its titles:

* Creative Department 1st Production (Team Maniax): Headed by Shinjiro Takata as a production manager, this is the oldest and original development division, which has been active since the very beginning of the company. This is the group responsible for the development of the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series in general from mainline titles such as &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; to spin-offs such as &quot;Devil Children&quot; series, &quot;Persona&quot; series prior to Persona 3, &quot;Devil Summoner&quot; series, &quot;Last Bible&quot; series, &quot;Majin Tensei&quot; series, &quot;Digital Devil Saga&quot; series, &quot;Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE&quot; among many others. Outside of the Megami Tensei series, the group also created and developed the &quot;Trauma Center&quot; series and the &quot;Etrian Odyssey&quot; series.
* Creative Department 2nd Production (P-Studio): Headed by Kazuhisa Wada, this group was established by Atlus during the development of &quot;Persona 3&quot; in 2006, to co-exist with the Creative Department 1st Production also known as Team Maniax, who were primarily responsible for developing entries in the Megami Tensei series at the company. The 2nd Production division would instead become the primary in charge of developing and overseeing all games and other products related to the &quot;Persona&quot; series, after all previous entries in the series on the original PlayStation had been mainly developed by Team Maniax. Leading the new &quot;Persona&quot; development team would be Katsura Hashino, who served as the director of &quot;Persona 3&quot; and other Atlus games such as &quot;Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne&quot; and went to be the director of &quot;Persona 4&quot; and &quot;Persona 5&quot;, being involved on various spin-offs until he departed from the division to create another one within Atlus. After Hashino left in 2016, long time director and producer Kazuhisa Wada became the head of the division. Outside of developing and overseeing all Persona games and products, P-Studio also developed the game &quot;Catherine&quot; in 2011.
* Creative Department 3rd Production (Studio Zero): Headed by Katsura Hashino. In 2016, following the Japanese launch of &quot;Persona 5,&quot; director and producer Hashino talked about his intent to depart P-Studio and retire his commitment to the &quot;Persona&quot; series, citing a desire to move onto another project due to his feelings that &quot;Persona 5&quot; would mark a shift in the series&#x27; overall direction. He would eventually be part of a new Creative Department production division established by Atlus, its third one mainly known as Studio Zero, which would become responsible for developing original IP and content unrelated to &quot;Persona.&quot; With fourteen P-Studio employees including main staff from the Persona series becoming part of the group like character designer Shigenori Soejima, scenario writers Yuichiro Tanaka and Azusa Kido, lead programmer Yujiro Kosaka and graphic designer Yasuhiro Akimoto, alongside new hires to the division, they are the creators of the 2024 game &quot;,&quot; a fantasy role-playing video game which was originally announced with a concept art as Project Re Fantasy in 2016 when Studio Zero was founded. Studio Zero&#x27;s first project, the enhanced re-release &quot;&quot; was released in 2019.

== International branches ==
=== Atlus West===
Atlus West (formerly known as Atlus U.S.A., Inc.) established in 1991 and based in Irvine, California, is the American subsidiary of Atlus and publishes games created by Atlus and other developers. It was formally called Index Digital Media from 2010 to 2014 in response to Atlus being dissolved into Index Corporation.

A number of &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; games have not been released in North America. During the 1990s, &quot;Jack Bros.&quot; for Virtual Boy, &quot;&quot; for PlayStation and &quot;&quot; for the Game Boy Color were the first three games in the series to have a North American release. The 2004 release of &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne&quot; was the first main-series video-game release in the U.S. Since then, the series has continued to be localized and released in the US, including games such as &quot;Persona 3&quot;, &quot;Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army&quot;, and &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey&quot;.

Atlus West has localized cult classic &quot;&quot;, created by Nippon Ichi Software. The company have also published the tactical role-playing game &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; and Game Boy Advance remakes of the &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; and &quot;Double Dragon&quot; games for Million (a company composed of former Technōs Japan employees). Other notable titles include &quot;Snowboard Kids&quot; and &quot;Snowboard Kids 2&quot; (for Nintendo 64) and &quot;Odin Sphere&quot; and the &quot;Trauma Center&quot; series. Atlus USA released &quot;&quot;, a role-playing video game for the Game Boy Advance previously released for the Wonderswan Color, in 2004 in collaboration with Sting and Bandai. In 2006 Atlus USA and Sting released &quot;Yggdra Union&quot;, a strategy role-playing game (RPG) for the Game Boy Advance. After Working Designs&#x27; publication of &quot;Growlanser Generations&quot;, they released &quot;&quot; in 2005 and &quot;Growlanser Wayfarer of Time&quot; in 2012.

The company established an online division, including the Atlus Online portal which is servicing &quot;Neo Steam: The Shattered Continent&quot; and &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Imagine&quot;. On 31 March 2013, Index Digital Media&#x27;s Atlus Online Division was purchased by Marvelous AQL and transferred to Xseed Games. Atlus USA has published games under the &quot;Marl Kingdom&quot; name, beginning with &quot;&quot; in 2000. On 18 February 2014 Sega announced that Index Digital Media would revert its name back to Atlus USA. In March 2016, Sega announced that all the future localized products from Atlus for North America will be published by Sega. Between 2019 and 2020, Atlus USA changed its public brand name to Atlus West.

=== Europe and Oceania ===
Until 2017, Atlus did not have a dedicated European division for publishing and distributing their titles within the European and Oceania region. Instead, many of Atlus&#x27; titles were published in these regions by Nippon Ichi Software (NIS) and its American division NIS America. Following Atlus&#x27;s acquisition by Sega Sammy Holdings, NIS found that it became more difficult to work between Sega and Atlus for distribution and in April 2016, formally ended its distribution partnership with Atlus. In July 2016, Deep Silver announced that it had come to agreement to become Atlus&#x27; distributor for Europe and Oceania, and would begin to publish titles in both retail and digital form. In August 2017, Atlus announced that they had opened a European distribution team located in Sega Europe&#x27;s offices in London that would publish all its games going forward.

== Corporate mascot ==

Jack Frost, who appears as a demon character in the &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; franchise, is the company mascot. Resembling a snowman, he has teeth, a tail and no nose, and wears a jester hat, collar, and shoes. His catchphrase is &quot;Hee-Ho&quot;. He has appeared in several games in the &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; series, as well as the &quot;Jack Bros.&quot; and Persona games. Jack Frost is a hidden character in the North American and Japanese versions of &quot;&quot;, with a larger role in the Japanese version. He has a family; more relatives were created since &quot;Shin Megami Tensei II&quot;, including King Frost, Jack-O-Lantern (Known as &quot;Pyro Jack&quot; in some localizations), Frost 5 Senshi, and Black Frost.

<text>Pulmonary edema (British English: oedema), also known as pulmonary congestion, is excessive fluid accumulation in the tissue or air spaces (usually alveoli) of the lungs. This leads to impaired gas exchange, most often leading to shortness of breath (dyspnea) which can progress to hypoxemia and respiratory failure. Pulmonary edema has multiple causes and is traditionally classified as cardiogenic (caused by the heart) or noncardiogenic (all other types not caused by the heart).

Various laboratory tests (CBC, troponin, BNP, etc.) and imaging studies (chest x-ray, CT scan, ultrasound) are often used to diagnose and classify the cause of pulmonary edema. 

Treatment is focused on three aspects: 

* improving respiratory function, 
* treating the underlying cause, and 
* preventing further damage and allow full recovery to the lung. 

Pulmonary edema can cause permanent organ damage, and when sudden (acute), can lead to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest due to hypoxia. The term edema is from the Greek (&quot;oidēma&quot;, &quot;swelling&quot;), from οἰδέω (&quot;oidéō&quot;, &quot;(I) swell&quot;).

== Pathophysiology ==
The amount of fluid in the lungs is governed by multiple forces and is visualized using the Starling equation. There are two hydrostatic pressures and two oncotic (protein) pressures that determine the fluid movement within the lung air spaces (alveoli). Of the forces that explain fluid movement, only the pulmonary wedge pressure is obtainable via pulmonary artery catheterization. Due to the complication rate associated with pulmonary artery catheterization, other imaging modalities and diagnostic methods have become more popular. Imbalance in any of these forces can cause fluid movement (or lack of movement) causing a buildup of fluid where it should not normally be. Although rarely clinically measured, these forces allow physicians to classify and subsequently treat the underlying cause of pulmonary edema.

==Classification==
Pulmonary edema has a multitude of causes, and is typically classified as cardiogenic or noncardiogenic. 

Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by increased hydrostatic pressure causing increased fluid in the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli. 

Noncardiogenic causes are associated with the oncotic pressure as discussed above causing malfunctioning barriers in the lungs (increased microvascular permeability). 

=== Cardiogenic ===

====Pulmonary Edema vs Congestive Heart Failure====

The term pulmonary edema literally means wet lungs. This term actually refers to a pathological condition of the lungs, frequently demonstrated by chest X-ray. Edema of the lungs should be thought of as the result of a disease such as congestive heart failure and not a disease in and of itself. In this case it would be a cardiac disease and not a pulmonary disease.

Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is typically caused by either volume overload or impaired left ventricular function. As a result, pulmonary venous pressures rises from the normal average of 15 mmHg. As the pulmonary venous pressure rises, these pressures overwhelm the barriers and fluid enters the alveoli when the pressure is above 25 mmHg. Depending on whether the cause is acute or chronic determines how fast pulmonary edema develops and the severity of symptoms. Some of the common causes of cardiogenic pulmonary edema include:
* Acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure which is due to the heart&#x27;s inability to pump the blood out of the pulmonary circulation at a sufficient rate resulting in elevation in pulmonary wedge pressure and edema. 
* Pericardial tamponade as well as treating pericardial tamponade via pericardiocentesis has shown to cause pulmonary edema as a result of increased left-sided heart strain.
* Heart Valve Dysfunction such as mitral valve regurgitation can cause increased pressure and energy on the left side of the heart (increased pulmonary wedge pressure) causing pulmonary edema.
* Hypertensive crisis can cause pulmonary edema as the elevation in blood pressure and increased afterload on the left ventricle hinders forward flow in blood vessels and causes the elevation in wedge pressure and subsequent pulmonary edema. In a recent systematic review, it was found that pulmonary edema was the second most common condition associated with hypertensive crisis after ischemic stroke.

==== Flash pulmonary edema ====
Flash pulmonary edema is a clinical syndrome that begins suddenly and accelerates rapidly. Essentially all patients will present to the emergency department by ambulance.

The initiating acute event often a vascular event such as intense vasoconstriction and not a cardiac event such as myocardial infarction. The most noticeable abnormality is edema of the lungs. Nevertheless it is a cardiovascular disease not a pulmonary disease. It is also known by other appellations including sympathetic crashing acute pulmonary edema (SCAPE). It is often associated with severe hypertension Typically, patients with the syndrome of flash pulmonary edema do not have chest pain are often not recognized as having a cardiovascular disease. Treatment of FPE should include reducing systemic vascular resistance with nitroglycerin, providing supplemental oxygenation, and decreasing left ventricular filling pressure. Effective treatment is evident by a decrease in dyspnea and normalization of vital signs. Important targets of therapy such as reduced systemic vascular resistance and reduced left atrial pressure are difficult if not impossible to monitor.

Recurrence of FPE is thought to be associated with hypertension and may signify renal artery stenosis. Prevention of recurrence is based on managing or preventing hypertension, coronary artery disease, renovascular hypertension, and heart failure.

===Noncardiogenic===
Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by increased microvascular permeability (increased oncotic pressure) leading to increased fluid transfer into the alveolar spaces. The pulmonary artery wedge pressure is typically normal as opposed to cardiogenic pulmonary edema where the elevated pressure is causing the fluid transfer. There are multiple causes of noncardiogenic edema with multiple subtypes within each cause. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a type of respiratory failure characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs. Although ARDS can present with pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation), it is a distinct clinical syndrome that is not synonymous with pulmonary edema. 

==== Direct lung injury ====
Acute lung injury may cause pulmonary edema directly through injury to the vasculature and parenchyma of the lung, causes include:
* Inhalation of hot or toxic gases (including vaping-associated lung injury)
* Pulmonary contusion, i.e., high-energy trauma (e.g. vehicle accidents)
* Aspiration, e.g., gastric fluid
* Reexpansion, i.e. post large volume thoracocentesis, resolution of pneumothorax, post decortication, removal of endobronchial obstruction, effectively a form of negative pressure pulmonary oedema.
* Reperfusion injury, i.e., postpulmonary thromboendartectomy or lung transplantation
* Swimming induced pulmonary edema also known as immersion pulmonary edema
* Transfusion associated Acute Lung Injury is a specific type of blood-product transfusion injury that occurs when the donors plasma contained antibodies against the recipient, such as anti-HLA or anti-neutrophil antibodies.

*Negative pressure pulmonary edema is when inspiration is attempted against some sort of obstruction in the upper airway, most commonly happens as a result of laryngospasm in adults. This negative pressure in the chest ruptures capillaries and floods the alveoli with blood
*Pulmonary embolism

==== Indirect lung injury ====
* Neurogenic causes (seizures, head trauma, strangulation, electrocution).
* Transfusion Associated Circulatory Overload occurs when multiple blood transfusions or blood-products (plasma, platelets, etc.) are transfused over a short period of time.
* It includes acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. (ALI-ARDS) cover many of these causes, Sepsis- Severe infection or inflammation which may be local or systemic. This is the classical form of acute lung injury-adult respiratory distress syndrome
* Pancreatitis

=== Special causes ===
Some causes of pulmonary edema are less well characterized and arguably represent specific instances of the broader classifications above.
* Arteriovenous malformation
* Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
* High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE)
* Envenomation, such as with the venom of Atrax robustus

==Signs and symptoms==

The most common symptom of pulmonary edema is dyspnea and may include other symptoms relating to inadequate oxygen (hypoxia) such as fast breathing (tachypnea), tachycardia and cyanosis. Other common symptoms include coughing up blood (classically seen as pink or red, frothy sputum), excessive sweating, anxiety, and pale skin. Other signs include end-inspiratory crackles (crackling sounds heard at the end of a deep breath) on auscultation and the presence of a third heart sound.

Shortness of breath can manifest as orthopnea (inability to breathe sufficiently when lying down flat) and/or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (episodes of severe sudden breathlessness at night). These are common presenting symptoms of chronic and cardiogenic pulmonary edema due to left ventricular failure. 

The development of pulmonary edema may be associated with symptoms and signs of &quot;fluid overload&quot; in the lungs; this is a non-specific term to describe the manifestations of &quot;right&quot; ventricular failure on the rest of the body. These symptoms may include peripheral edema (swelling of the legs, in general, of the &quot;pitting&quot; variety, wherein the skin is slow to return to normal when pressed upon due to fluid), raised jugular venous pressure and hepatomegaly, where the liver is excessively enlarged and may be tender or even pulsatile. 

Additional symptoms such as fever, low blood pressure, injuries or burns may be present and can help characterize the cause and subsequent treatment strategies.

==Diagnosis==

There is no single test for confirming that breathlessness is caused by pulmonary edema – there are many causes of shortness of breath; but there are methods to suggest a high probability of an edema.

=== Lab tests ===
Low oxygen saturation in blood and disturbed arterial blood gas readings support the proposed diagnosis by suggesting a pulmonary shunt. Blood tests are performed for electrolytes (sodium, potassium) and markers of renal function (creatinine, urea). Elevated creatine levels may suggest a cardiogenic cause of pulmonary edema. Liver enzymes, inflammatory markers (usually C-reactive protein) and a complete blood count as well as coagulation studies (PT, aPTT) are also typically requested as further diagnosis. Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) may suggest a non-cardiogenic cause such as sepsis or infection. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is available in many hospitals, sometimes even as a point-of-care test. Low levels of BNP (&lt;100 pg/ml) suggest a cardiac cause is unlikely, and suggest noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.

=== Imaging tests ===

Chest X-ray has been used for many years to diagnose pulmonary edema due to its wide availability and relatively cheap cost. A chest X-ray will show fluid in the alveolar walls, Kerley B lines, increased vascular shadowing in a classical batwing peri-hilum pattern, upper lobe diversion (biased blood flow to the superior parts instead of inferior parts of the lung), and possibly pleural effusions. In contrast, patchy alveolar infiltrates are more typically associated with noncardiogenic edema. 

Lung ultrasounds, employed by a healthcare provider at the point of care, is also a useful tool to diagnose pulmonary edema; not only is it accurate, but it may quantify the degree of lung water, track changes over time, and differentiate between cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic edema. Lung ultrasound is recommended as the first-line method due to its wide availability, ability to be performed bedside, and wide diagnostic utility for other similar diseases.

Especially in the case of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, urgent echocardiography may strengthen the diagnosis by demonstrating impaired left ventricular function, high central venous pressures and high pulmonary artery pressures leading to pulmonary edema.

==Prevention==
In those with underlying heart or lung disease, effective control of congestive and respiratory symptoms can help prevent pulmonary edema. 

Dexamethasone is in widespread use for the prevention of high altitude pulmonary edema. Sildenafil is used as a preventive treatment for altitude-induced pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension. Sildenafil&#x27;s mechanism of action is via phosphodiesterase inhibition which raises cGMP, resulting in pulmonary arterial vasodilation and inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and indirectly fluid formation in the lungs. While this effect has only recently been discovered, sildenafil is already becoming an accepted treatment for this condition, in particular in situations where the standard treatment of rapid descent (acclimatization) has been delayed for some reason.

==Management==
The initial management of pulmonary edema, irrespective of the type or cause, is supporting vital functions while edema lasts. Hypoxia may require supplementary oxygen to balance blood oxygen levels, but if this is insufficient then again mechanical ventilation may be required to prevent complications caused by hypoxia. Therefore, if the level of consciousness is decreased it may be required to proceed to tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation to prevent airway compromise. Treatment of the underlying cause is the next priority; pulmonary edema secondary to infection, for instance, would require the administration of appropriate antibiotics or antivirals.

===Cardiogenic pulmonary edema===

Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is the result of cardiovascular insufficiency. Treatment is directed at improving cardiovascular function and providing supportive care.
 Positioning upright may relieve symptoms. A loop diuretic such as furosemide is administered, often together with morphine to reduce respiratory distress. Both diuretic and morphine may have vasodilator effects, but specific vasodilators may be used (particularly intravenous glyceryl trinitrate or ISDN) provided the blood pressure is adequate.

Continuous positive airway pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure (CPAP/BiPAP) has been demonstrated to reduce mortality and the need of mechanical ventilation in people with severe cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

It is possible for cardiogenic pulmonary edema to occur together with cardiogenic shock, in which the cardiac output is insufficient to sustain an adequate blood pressure to the lungs. This can be treated with inotropic agents or by intra-aortic balloon pump, but this is regarded as temporary treatment while the underlying cause is addressed and the lungs recover.

== Prognosis ==
As pulmonary edema has a wide variety of causes and presentations, the outcome or prognosis is often disease-dependent and more accurately described in relation to the associated syndrome. It is a major health problem, with one large review stating an incidence of 7.6% with an associated in hospital mortality rate of 11.9%. Generally, pulmonary edema is associated with a poor prognosis with a 50% survival rate at one year, and 85% mortality at six years.

<doc id="418164" wikidata="Q312905" url="?curid=418164" title="Calico Jack">
<text>John Rackham (hanged 18 November 1720), commonly known as Calico Jack, was an English pirate captain operating in the Bahamas and in Cuba during the early 18th century. His nickname was derived from the calico clothing that he wore, while Jack is a nickname for &quot;John&quot;.

Rackham was active towards the end (1718–1720) of the &quot;Golden Age of Piracy&quot;. He is most remembered for having two female crew members: Mary Read and his lover, Anne Bonny.

Rackham deposed Charles Vane from his position as captain of the sloop &quot;Ranger&quot;, then cruised the Leeward Islands, Jamaica Channel and Windward Passage. He accepted the King&#x27;s Pardon in 1719 and moved to New Providence, where he met Anne Bonny, who was married to James Bonny at the time. He returned to piracy in 1720 by stealing a British sloop and Anne joined him. Their new crew included Mary Read, who was disguised as a man at the time. After a short run, Rackham was captured by Jonathan Barnet, an English privateer, in 1720, put on trial by Sir Nicholas Lawes, Governor of Jamaica, and hanged in November of that year in Port Royal, Jamaica.

==Early life and career==
Little is known of Rackham&#x27;s upbringing or early life. The first record of him is as quartermaster on Charles Vane&#x27;s brigantine &quot;Ranger&quot; in 1718, operating out of New Providence island in the Bahamas, which was a notorious base for pirates known as the &quot;Pirates&#x27; republic&quot;. Vane and his crew robbed several ships outside New York City, then encountered a large French man-of-war. The ship was at least twice as large as Vane&#x27;s brigantine, and it immediately pursued them. Vane commanded a retreat from battle, claiming caution as his reason. Jack Rackham quickly spoke up and contested the decision, suggesting that they fight the man-of-war because it would have plenty of riches. In addition, he argued, if they captured the ship, it would place a much larger ship at their disposal. Of the approximately ninety-one men on the ship, only fifteen supported Vane in his decision. Vane declared that the captain&#x27;s decision is considered final and despite the overwhelming support for Rackham&#x27;s cry to fight they fled the man-of-war.
On 24 November 1718, Rackham called a vote in which the men branded Vane a coward and removed him from the captaincy, making Calico Jack the next captain. Rackham gave Vane and his fifteen supporters the other ship in the fleet, along with a decent supply of ammunition and goods.

==Captain Rackham==
Rackham made a career of plundering small vessels close to shore once he became captain. He and his crew captured the &quot;Kingston&quot;, a small Jamaican vessel, and made it their flagship. They made several conquests in the West Indies, taking a couple of large ships off Bermuda. 

In 1719, Rackham sailed into Nassau in the Bahamas, taking advantage of a general amnesty for pirates to obtain a royal pardon and commission from Governor Woodes Rogers. Rogers had been sent to the Bahamas to address the problem of pirates in the Caribbean who had started to attack and steal from British ships.

In December, he captured the merchant ship &quot;Kingston&quot;. The &quot;Kingston&quot; had a rich cargo, and promised to be a big score for Rackham and his crew. Unfortunately for him, the &quot;Kingston&quot; had been taken within sight of Port Royal, where outraged merchants outfitted bounty hunters to go after him. They caught up with him in February 1719, while his ship and the &quot;Kingston&quot; were anchored at Isla de los Pinos off Cuba. Rackham and most of his men were on shore at the time, escaping capture by hiding in the woods, but their ship and rich trophy were taken away.

Captain Charles Johnson describes how Rackham stole a sloop in his seminal 1724 book &quot;A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the most notorious Pyrates&quot;. Rackham and his men were at a town in Cuba refitting their small sloop when a Spanish warship charged with patrolling the Cuban coast entered the harbour, along with a small English sloop which they had captured. The Spanish warship saw the pirates but could not get at them at low tide, so they anchored in the harbour entrance to wait for morning. That night, Rackham and his men rowed over to the captured English sloop and overpowered the Spanish guards there. As dawn broke, the warship began blasting Rackham&#x27;s old ship, now empty, as Rackham and his men silently sailed past in their new prize.

Rackham and his men made their way back to Nassau, where they appeared before Governor Rogers and asked for the royal pardon, claiming that Vane had forced them to become pirates. Rogers hated Vane and chose to believe them, granting them the pardon and allowing them to stay. Their time as honest men, however, did not last long.

==Anne Bonny==
While in port, Rackham began an affair with Anne Bonny, wife of sailor James Bonny, who was employed by Governor Rogers. James Bonny learned about the relationship and brought Anne to Governor Rogers, who ordered her whipped on charges of adultery. Rackham offered to buy Anne in a &quot;divorce by purchase&quot;, because he liked her, but her husband sternly refused. This caused Anne to flee Nassau and run away with Rackham. The pair (with a new crew) escaped to sea together, voiding Rackham&#x27;s pardon, by stealing a sloop belonging to John Ham. They sailed the Caribbean for two months, taking over other pirate ships. Rackham would often invite the crew of ships that he attacked to join his own. Anne became pregnant and went home to Cuba to have the child. 

==Capture, trial and death==
In September 1720, Bahamian Governor Woodes Rogers issued a proclamation declaring Rackham and his crew pirates—although it was not published until October 1721. After publication of the warrant, pirate hunter Jonathan Barnet and former pirate Jean Bonadvis started in pursuit of Rackham, who was cruising near Jamaica capturing numerous small fishing vessels and terrorizing fishermen along the northern Jamaican coastline.

Rackham and his crew had been sailing west, towards Negril. On or around October 31, 1720 Rackham&#x27;s sloop was laid at anchor and fired a gun which caught the attention of Jean Bonadvis&#x27; sloop. Bonadvis reported this to Barnet who sailed to investigate the sloop. At 10 PM Barnet called out to the sloop and inquired who they were. The reply was &quot;John Rackham from Cuba&quot; and Barnet immediately ordered him to strike his colors. Someone (Barnet testified that because of it being so dark he could not identify who) replied that they would not surrender and fired a swivel gun at Barnet&#x27;s sloop. Barnet ordered a broadside which destroyed the boom on Rackham&#x27;s ship and his crew called for quarter.

Barnet had the men put ashore at Davis&#x27;s Cove near Lucea, Jamaica, where Major Richard James, a militia officer, placed them under arrest. Rackham and his crew were brought to Spanish Town, Jamaica, in November 1720, where they were tried and convicted of piracy and sentenced to be hanged.

Rackham was executed in Port Royal on 18 November 1720, his body then gibbeted on display on a very small islet at a main entrance to Port Royal now known as Rackham&#x27;s Cay.

==Fate of his crew==
Anne Bonny and Mary Read both claimed to be pregnant at their trials, ten days after Rackham&#x27;s execution, and so were given a temporary stay, and imprisoned at Fort Charles until the claim was proven. Read died in her cell in April 1721, most likely of fever related to childbirth. There is no historical record of Bonny&#x27;s release or of her execution.

George Fetherston (Master), Richard Corner (Quarter-Master), John Davis, and John Howell were executed along with Jack Rackham in Port Royal. Patrick Carty, Thomas Earl, James Dobbin and Noah Harwood were executed the next day in Kingston.

The day after Rackham&#x27;s trial, former crew members John &quot;Old Dad the Cooper&quot; Fenwick (alias &quot;Fenis&quot;) and Thomas Bourn (alias Brown) were separately tried and convicted for mutinies committed in mid-June 1720 off Hispaniola.

Nine men who had been caught drinking with Rackham&#x27;s crew (John Eaton, Edward Warner, Thomas Baker, Thomas Quick, John Cole, Benjamin Palmer, Walter Rouse, John Hanson, and John Howard) were tried and convicted on 24 January 1721. On 17 February John Eaton, Thomas Quick and Thomas Baker were executed at Gallows Point, at Port Royal, and the next day John Cole, John Howard and Benjamin Palmer, were executed at Kingston. The fate of the remaining three (Edward Warner, Walter Rouse and John Hanson) is unknown.
==Jolly Roger flag==
The flag commonly associated with Rackham depicts a white skull above crossed swords on a black background, and Rackham is sometimes credited with inventing or designing the Jolly Roger design. At trial, however, no witness described Rackham ever using such a flag, only noting that his sloop flew &quot;a white pendant&quot; (pennon). The skull-and-crossed-swords design likely dates to the early 20th century, and attaching it to Calico Jack can be traced to a 1959 book by Hans Leip, &quot;Bordbuch des Satans&quot;.

<text>Emperor Cheng of Jin (; December 321 or January 322 – 26 July 342), personal name Sima Yan (), courtesy name Shigen (), was an emperor of the Chinese Eastern Jin dynasty. He was the eldest son of Emperor Ming and became the crown prince on April 1, 325. During his reign, the administration was largely dominated by a succession of regents—initially his uncle Yu Liang, then Wang Dao, then the joint administration of He Chong and another uncle Yu Bing. He became emperor at age four, and soon after his accession to the throne, the disastrous rebellion of Su Jun weakened Jin forces for decades.

==Family background==
Sima Yan was born as the oldest son of Emperor Ming of Jin, who was crown prince at that time, by his wife Crown Princess Yu Wenjun, in December 321 or January 322. After Emperor Ming took the throne in January 323 following the death of his father Emperor Yuan, he created Crown Princess Yu empress, but did not immediately create Prince Yan crown prince, until 325.

In fall 325, Emperor Ming grew ill. He entrusted the four-year-old Crown Prince Yan to a group of high-level officials, including Sima Yang () the Prince of Xiyang, Wang Dao, Bian Kun (), Xi Jian, Lu Ye (), Wen Jiao, and Empress Yu&#x27;s brother Yu Liang, perhaps intending that they lead by group with a balance of power. He died soon thereafter. Crown Prince Yan took the throne as Emperor Cheng.

==Reign==
=== Yu Liang&#x27;s regency ===
Initially, the officials were in charge together, but as Empress Dowager Yu became regent, Yu Liang became effectively the most powerful official in the administration. He changed from the lenient policies of Wang (who was prime minister during Emperor Ming&#x27;s reign) to stricter applications of laws and regulations, which offended the officials accustomed to Wang&#x27;s lenience. He also became apprehensive of the generals Tao Kan and Zu Yue—neither of whom was mentioned in the list of honors and promotions announced by Emperor Ming&#x27;s will and believed that Yu had erased their names from the will—and Su Jun, who had allowed many criminals to join his army. In 326, he alienated public opinion by falsely accusing Sima Yang&#x27;s brother Sima Zong () the Prince of Nandun of treason and killing him and deposing Sima Yang.

===The Su Jun Disturbance===
In 327, apprehensive of Su, Yu decided to try to strip his military command by promoting him to the minister of agriculture—a position that did not involve commanding troops. After initially hesitating, Su eventually refused and formed an alliance with Zu against Yu. Upon hearing this, Wen, whom Yu had made the governor of Jiang Province (江州, modern Jiangxi) to defend against Tao, the governor of Jing Province (modern Hubei), wanted to quickly move to help defend the capital Jiankang, as did the local forces to the east of the capital, but Yu declined all help, wanting Wen to remain in position against Tao and believing that he can defeat Su easily. Fearful that Yu would be defeated by Su, Wen headed toward the capital anyway. Before Wen arrived, Su was able to capture the capital in early 328 and take Emperor Cheng and Empress Dowager Yu hostage. Bian died in the battle, and Yu Liang was forced to flee to camp of Wen. Su allowed his soldiers to pillage the capital, and officials and commoners alike had their possessions—as well as clothes—stripped by Su&#x27;s army, which even seized Empress Dowager Yu&#x27;s servant girls. Empress Dowager Yu, humiliated by Su and fearful of what was to come, soon died in anxiety.

Su organized a new government, with Wang Dao, whom Su respected, as the titular regent, but with Su himself in actual power. Meanwhile, Yu and Wen organized efforts to recapture the capital. Wen&#x27;s cousin Wen Chong () suggested inviting Tao, a capable general with a sizable army, to be the supreme commander of the army. However, Tao, still resentful of Yu, initially refused. Eventually he relented and joined Wen and Yu. They advanced east toward Jiankang. In response, Su forcibly took Emperor Cheng to the fortress of Shitou and put him and his attendants under virtual arrest. Meanwhile, Wang was secretly ordering the commanderies to the east to rise against Su, and he eventually persuaded Su&#x27;s general Lu Yong () to defect with him to Wen and Tao&#x27;s army as well. Xi also arrived with his forces from Guangling (in modern Huai&#x27;an, Jiangsu).

The Su and anti-Su forces battled for months, indecisively, and despite the numeric advantage the anti-Su forces had, they were unable to prevail, leading Tao to at one point consider withdrawing. However, Wen was able to persuade him to stay and continuing the battles against Su. In the fall, during an assault on Shitou, the anti-Su forces initially suffered losses, but as Su was making a counterattack against them, he fell off his horse and was hit by spears. The anti-Su soldiers rushed him and decapitated him. Su&#x27;s forces initially supported his brother Su Yi () as leader and continued to defend Shitou, but by early 329 were defeated.

In the aftermaths of Su Jun&#x27;s defeat, with Jiankang having been heavily damaged by war, the top officials considered moving the capital to either Yuzhang (豫章, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) or Kuaiji (in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang), but after Wang opposed, noting that Jiankang was in a better position to monitor the northern defenses against Northern archrival Later Zhao, the capital remained at Jiankang. Wen was requested to remain in Jiankang as regent, but he, believing that Emperor Ming intended Wang to serve that role, yielded the position to Wang. Meanwhile, Yu Liang, initially offering to resign all of his posts and go into exile, accepted a provincial governor post.

In light of his mother&#x27;s death, the eight-year-old Emperor Cheng appeared to have been raised by his paternal grandmother, Lady Xun, from this point on.

===Wang Dao&#x27;s regency===
In late 329, Wen Jiao died, and the general Guo Mo () soon assassinated his successor Liu Yin () and seized Jing Province for himself. Wang Dao initially wanted to avoid another war and placated Guo, but Tao Kan and Yu Liang opposed, and their forces quickly converged on Jiang Province&#x27;s capital Xunyang (尋陽, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi) in 330, killing Guo.

Meanwhile, during and after the Su Jun Disturbance, Jin forces in central China, without the central government&#x27;s aid, were unable to hold their positions and eventually lost most of central China to Later Zhao. Key cities lost during this time included the old capital Luoyang, Shouchun (壽春, in modern Lu&#x27;an, Anhui), and Xiangyang (in modern Hubei), although Xiangyang was recaptured in 332. In 333, Jin also lost Ning Province (寧州, modern Yunnan and Guizhou) to Cheng-Han (but regained it in 339).

As regent, Wang largely restored his earlier policy of lenience and lax enforcement of the laws, greatly stabilizing the political scene but also leading to the spreading of corruption and incompetence. Eventually, in 338, Yu Liang tried to persuade Xi Jian to join him in moving to depose Wang, but after Xi refused, Yu did not carry out his plan.

In 336, Emperor Cheng married his wife Empress Du. Both of them were 15.

In 337, Murong Huang, the Xianbei chief who had been a Jin vassal with the Jin-bestowed title of Duke of Liaodong, claimed the title of Prince of Yan notwithstanding Jin&#x27;s failure to grant him that title, effectively declaring independence and establishing Former Yan, although Murong Huang continued to claim to be a Jin vassal.

In 339, Yu wanted to make a major attack against Later Zhao, hoping to recapture central China, and Wang initially agreed with him, but after opposition by Xi and Cai Mo, Emperor Cheng ordered Yu not to carry out the war plans. Wang died in the fall of that year, and was succeeded by his assistant He Chong () and Yu Liang&#x27;s younger brother Yu Bing. Emperor Cheng let He and Yu Bing decide most important matters, but also appeared to start making some decisions of his own. Yu Bing and He tried to reform some of the problems with Wang&#x27;s regency, but did not appear very effective at doing so.

===Late reign===
After Wang Dao&#x27;s death, Yu Liang resumed his plans for a campaign against Later Zhao, and this brought a major response by Later Zhao&#x27;s emperor Shi Hu in late 339. Later Zhao forces inflicted great damage on many Jin cities and bases north of the Yangtze and captured Zhucheng (邾城, in modern Huanggang, Hubei). Humiliated, Yu cancelled the plans for a northern expedition, and he died in early 340.

Also in 340, Murong Huang formally requested that he be granted the title Prince of Yan. After protracted debates among key officials about whether Murong Huang was still a faithful vassal, Emperor Cheng himself ruled that the request be granted.

In spring 341, Empress Du died. Emperor Cheng would not create another empress.

Later that year, Emperor Cheng decreed that the refugees from northern and central China, who had fled south during the times of Emperor Huai and Emperor Min due to Five Barbarians Uprising, who had retained household registrations according to their native commanderies, be henceforth registered with the commanderies that they were now living in. This pragmatic move allowed the local commanderies to have greater manpower and reduced redundancy in local administrations.

In summer 342, Emperor Cheng grew gravely ill. He had two young sons -- Sima Pi and Sima Yi, then still in cradles, by his concubine Consort Zhou. Yu Bing, fearful that the Yu Clan would lose power if a young emperor were named, persuaded Emperor Cheng that in the face of the powerful enemy Later Zhao that an older emperor should be named. Emperor Cheng agreed and designated his younger brother, Sima Yue the Prince of Langya be his heir, despite He Chong&#x27;s opposition. He issued an edict entrusting his sons to Yu Bing, He, Sima Xi (), Prince of Wuling, Sima Yu, Prince of Kuaiji (both paternal uncles), and Zhuge Hui (). He died soon thereafter and was succeeded by Prince Yue (as Emperor Kang).

<doc id="418172" wikidata="Q1235430" url="?curid=418172" title="Mizithra">
<text>Mizithra or myzithra ( ) is a Greek whey cheese or mixed milk-whey cheese from sheep or goats, or both. It is sold both as a fresh cheese, similar to Italian &quot;ricotta&quot;, and as a salt-dried grating cheese, similar to Italian &quot;ricotta salata&quot;. The ratio of milk to whey is usually 7 to 3.

It is primarily produced on the island of Crete, but is widespread throughout Greece. It is essentially the same as Anthotyros though the latter may contain some cow&#x27;s milk. In Cyprus a similar cheese is known as &quot;Anari&quot; (Αναρή in Greek, &quot;Nor&quot; in Cypriot Turkish, &quot;Lor&quot; in Turkish).

Mizithra is made from raw, whole ewe&#x27;s or goat&#x27;s milk in the simplest way possible: milk is brought to a slow boil for a few minutes and then curdled by adding rennet or whey from a previous batch (see below) or else some acidic substance such as lemon juice, vinegar or even a fresh broken fig tree sprig. As soon as curds have formed they are poured into a cheesecloth bag and hung to drain. The whey dripping out of the bag can be used to curdle the next batch of mizithra. After a few days mizithra forms a sweet, moist, soft mass molded in the shape of the hanging bag with a rounded bottom and a conical, wrinkly top. At this stage it is called &quot;sweet&quot; or &quot;fresh mizithra&quot; and may be eaten or, often, baked in pies.

==Xynomizithra==

Mizithra that is salted and aged becomes dryer, denser, saltier and more sour. This &quot;xynomizithra&quot; (&#x27;sour mizithra&#x27;) is often grated.

==Serving==

The cheese is soft, snow-white, creamy, and moist. Since no salt is added to mizithra it has an almost sweet and milky taste. It is eaten as dessert with honey or as mezes with olives and tomato. It is used as a table cheese, as well as in salads, pastries and in baking, notably in little cheese pies (handful size) and Sfakiani pita (pie from the Sfakia region).

In its salted, aged form it is considered the grating cheese &quot;par excellence&quot; of Greek cuisine, and is especially suited for sprinkling over hot pasta.

==Toponymy==
The town of Mystras takes its name from a cone-shaped hill, called Mizithra from its resemblance to the cheese (Steven Runciman, &quot;A Traveller&#x27;s Alphabet&quot;, &quot;Morea&quot;).

<doc id="418175" wikidata="Q2425007" url="?curid=418175" title="The Brak Show">
<text>The Brak Show is an American adult animated sitcom created by Jim Fortier, Andy Merrill, and Pete Smith for Cartoon Network&#x27;s late-night programming block, Adult Swim. &quot;The Brak Show&quot; serves as a spin-off of the animated television series &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, for which the show&#x27;s creators originally wrote, and featured recurring characters from &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; and &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot;. Both programs used stock footage from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon &quot;Space Ghost&quot;, for which &quot;The Brak Show&quot; serves as a prequel. The protagonist is Brak, voiced by Merrill, who developed a quirky persona for the character.

&quot;Leave it to Brak&quot;, a pilot episode that serves as an earlier version of the fifth episode &quot;Bawk Ba Gawk&quot;, originally aired prior to the official launch of Adult Swim on Cartoon Network, on December 21, 2000 at 5:15 AM. The series made its official premiere debut during the night Adult Swim officially launched on September 2, 2001 as its second inaugural program, and ended on December 31, 2003, with a total of 28 episodes. On May 24, 2007, a webisode was released on Adult Swim Video, ending the series.

==History==
&quot;The Brak Show&quot; was preceded by a two-part special titled &quot;Brak Presents the Brak Show Starring Brak&quot;. Despite the similarities in the titles, the two &quot;Brak Shows&quot; have very little in common. The specials parodied variety shows, while the series was a spoof of early sitcoms. Each of the specials aired in the United States only once in February and March 2000, respectively.

The series premiered with a sneak peek unannounced in the early hours of December 21, 2000, along with the &quot;Radio Free Sealab&quot; episode of &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;. This &quot;stealth&quot; pilot (titled &quot;Leave it to Brak&quot;) featured hand-drawn backgrounds and different opening titles. The show&#x27;s official showing was on Adult Swim&#x27;s debut on September 2, 2001.

It originally started as a parody of sitcoms which depicts the day-to-day lives of the dysfunctional Guerta family, including Brak, as well as Zorak, various other neighbors, and peers from Learnmore High School, but just like its sister show, &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, the plot dissolved over time and became increasingly bizarre. The setting is Spacetown, which resembles American suburbia, but with an extra-planetary hint. A Saturn-like planet appears in the background on occasion, and many of the extras are aliens. Often, episodes parody stereotypical episodes of regular sitcoms (e.g., the son showing an interest in women, the dad being reconnected with an old passion, the mother temporarily leaving after a fight, etc.).

The show was canceled in December 2003. However, on October 22, 2006, Adult Swim announced in a bumper that &quot;The Brak Show&quot; would return to production as an internet cartoon on the network&#x27;s website. On May 24, 2007, a single webisode premiered online, but no further webisodes were produced thereafter, hence serving as the &quot;de facto&quot; series finale.

On August 1, 2008, Adult Swim had a retro night, an all-night marathon of shows featured on Adult Swim in 2001 and 2002. Two of the early episodes of &quot;The Brak Show&quot; aired during the marathon. The series has since appeared in Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;DVR Theater&quot;. Since 2019, Adult Swim has aired &quot;The Brak Show&quot; as part of &quot;Pete Smith Day&quot;, a yearly event celebrating the career of one of &quot;The Brak Show&quot;″s co-creators.

In 2024, Brak&#x27;s mom and Clarence were mentioned in the &quot;Jellystone!&quot; season three episode ″Space Con”.

==Characters==

* Brak (Andy Merrill) is a sort of teenage anthropomorphic &quot;space cat&quot; with an eccentric personality and a speaking lisp, who is a student at Learnmore High School. He is quite silly and unintelligent but with a very sweet and gentle personality. He still has attachments to stuffed animals but starts to get attracted to girls. He frequently breaks into impromptu song, lyrically about events in the episode. The writers use a wide variety of musical styles for the songs — covering jazz, country, show tunes, rap, and rock &amp; roll. His closest friend is Zorak, although in return he treats him with open contempt and little respect. Brak&#x27;s demeanor is derived from his appearances on both &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot;.
* Zorak (C. Martin Croker) is another character from &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, a 40 year old anthropomorphic human-sized mantis who poses as a teenager to attend Learnmore High School. On this show, he plays the role similar to that of Eddie Haskell character, who is also a sociopathic, sadistic, morally bankrupt misanthrope who expresses more than a platonic interest in Mom. He hangs out with Brak, but only as a way to force him into doing something for his own benefit. Zorak considers himself &quot;above&quot; the Guertas, and is constantly criticizing and insulting them. He enjoys bullying Clarence, the neighborhood nerd. He is also homophobic, breaking into furious rage when one of his romantic interests, Pepper, is revealed to be male.
* Dad (George Lowe) is a middle-aged small human and illegal alien with a Cuban accent, who is extremely self-centered, lazy, and nonsensical. Unemployed since 1984, most of his time is spent sitting at the kitchen table and reading the newspaper. An episode seldom goes by without him delivering &quot;fatherly advice&quot; or a &quot;moral of the story&quot; that is often incoherent or has no relevance to the situation, and typically ends in a &quot;non sequitur&quot;. Occasionally, he displays prominent womanizing and male-chauvinistic behavior, which is sometimes rebuked by his wife. In an Adult Swim New Year&#x27;s Eve bumper in 2003, he revealed his name to be &quot;Javier&quot;. He is also extremely incompetent at holding a paid job; during his brief stint working at the ice cream shop in the episode &quot;We Ski in Peace&quot;, he tries to take his break immediately after the store opens and shoots the ice cream because &quot;it was about to rob [the ice cream store]&quot;. In the same episode, he is shown to have a high-ranking job in protecting the Earth in a base underneath the house, but does so for free. He also cares little for his children, doing things like using Brak&#x27;s college funds to buy a ski boat and being unfazed when Sisto was selected as &quot;the lucky one&quot; and seized by an alien mothership.
* Mom (Marsha Crenshaw in episodes 1–13, 18 (DVD), 28, and the webisode, Joanna Daniel in episodes 14–17, 18 (broadcast), and 19–28) is a middle-aged creature of the same &quot;species&quot; as Brak, with a more humanoid facial structure and the fashions of a housewife character on a 1950s sitcom. She is largely the only semi-sane character on the show. She displays little romantic or sexual interest in her husband and only tolerates him for her children&#x27;s sake. When she gets drunk, however, she finds him suddenly irresistible. When voiced by Crenshaw, she is most often a homage to June Cleaver and similar motherly characters, with occasional hints of discontent with her husband&#x27;s laziness and most importantly, his sexism. When Daniel took over the role, Mom inexplicably acquired a British accent and became far more open in her discontent with domestic life and her annoyance with and disdain for her husband. Her change in accent has been commented upon several times on the show.
* Thundercleese (Carey Means) is Brak&#x27;s next-door neighbor, an anthropomorphic militant killbot (with the visual appearance of a Gundam or a similar anime-style robot) who is passionate about his lawn and garden, particularly the gnomes that decorate it. A short-lived shtick involved Thundercleese blasting Zorak whenever intentionally provoked. He is very aggressive and warlike, always speaking in a loud, robotic monotone. When Brak is troubled, no matter what the problem is, Thundercleese invariably suggests swift and brutal retaliation. Thundercleese&#x27;s social skills are rather lacking, and before social get-togethers, he studies very bad &quot;party jokes&quot; in preparation. Thundercleese&#x27;s creator is MoroccoBotix, as shown in an early episode of the series, and a special 2003 New Year&#x27;s Eve event on Adult Swim in 2003 revealed that &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;″s Frylock bought and raised him, which is the in-universe reason for their similar voices.
* Clarence (Andy Merrill) is Brak&#x27;s second closest friend, a teenage chubby purple alien from Learnmore High School. He was a supporting character on the show who made more regular appearances towards the end of the series. Clarence is socially awkward and idolizes Brak. His constant talking often annoys those around him, and when faced with an extremely stressful situation, he wears his mother&#x27;s sundress and bonnet for comfort. In a rap contest, he revealed that he dearly misses his father, who left them for unknown reasons. In the same contest, he also noted that his mom has since married his stepfather Gary, whom he does not like. Many of his appearances end with him being maimed, usually by Zorak. According to Andy Merrill, he was originally going to be the series&#x27; version of &quot;Space Ghost&quot; villain The Schemer but the one-shot character Butchy Toughington ended up becoming &quot;The Brak Show&quot; version of The Schemer instead of Clarence.
* Sisto is Brak&#x27;s younger brother, an elementary school aged &quot;space cat&quot; who resembles his elder brother even though he wears a red outfit as opposed to his brother&#x27;s blue one. In three early episodes, he would make random appearances walking across the room farting. He was killed and eaten by mothership aliens in his fourth and final appearance in the episode &quot;Pepper&quot;. Afterwards, only a picture of himself was depicted on a scratch and sniff card in the episode &quot;Sexy New Brak Show Go&quot;.

<doc id="418176" wikidata="Q31863" url="?curid=418176" title="Verein für Raumschiffahrt">
<text>The Verein für Raumschiffahrt (&quot;VfR&quot;, ) was a German amateur rocket association prior to World War II that included members outside Germany. The first successful VfR test firing with liquid fuel (five minutes) was conducted by Max Valier at the Heylandt Works on January 25, 1930; and additional rocket experiments were conducted at a farm near Bernstadt, Saxony.

Space travel and rocketry gained popularity in Germany after the June 1923 publication of Herman Oberth&#x27;s book &quot;Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen&quot; () and the expanded 1929 work &quot;Wege zur Raumschiffahrt&quot; (&quot;Ways to Spaceflight&quot;).

The VfR was founded in 1927 by Johannes Winkler, with Max Valier and Willy Ley after their participation as expert advisers for Fritz Lang&#x27;s early science fiction film &quot;Frau im Mond&quot; (&quot;The Woman in the Moon&quot;). Ley and Hermann Oberth had hoped to receive funding from Lang for a real-life experimental rocket launch coinciding with the movie&#x27;s premiere. Valier had assisted in Fritz von Opel&#x27;s rocket-powered publicity stunts for the Opel company.
In September 1930, before Hitler came to power, the VfR requested funding from the German army. Rockets were one of the few types of military development not restricted by the Versailles treaty at the end of World War I, 11 years earlier. They received permission from the municipality to use an abandoned ammunition dump at Reinickendorf, the Berlin rocket launching site (). For three years the VfR launched increasingly powerful rockets of their own design from this location. Following the unsuccessful Mirak rockets, the most powerful rocket of the Repulsor series (named for a spaceship in a German novel by Kurd Lasswitz) reached altitudes over 1 km (3,000 ft).

In the spring of 1932, Capt Walter Dornberger, his commander (Captain Ritter von Horstig), and Col Karl Heinrich Emil Becker viewed a (failed) VfR launch, and Dornberger subsequently issued a contract for a demonstration launch. Wernher von Braun, who was then a young student and had joined the group two years earlier, was in favor of the contract The group eventually rejected the proposal and the dissension caused during its consideration contributed to the society dissolving itself in January 1934. The society&#x27;s demise was also the result of an inability to find funding, and Berlin&#x27;s civic authorities becoming concerned with rocketry experiments so close to the city.

The only known VfR rocket artifact is a rejected aluminium Repulsor nozzle which member Herbert Schaefer took to the US when he emigrated in 1935 and which he donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1978.

<doc id="418179" wikidata="Q1147963" url="?curid=418179" title="Whyte notation">
<text>The Whyte notation is a classification method for steam locomotives, and some internal combustion locomotives and electric locomotives, by wheel arrangement. It was devised by Frederick Methvan Whyte, and came into use in the early twentieth century following a December 1900 editorial in &quot;American Engineer and Railroad Journal&quot;.

The notation was adopted and remains in use in North America and the United Kingdom to describe the wheel arrangements of steam locomotives, but for modern locomotives, multiple units and trams it has been supplanted by the UIC system in Europe and by the AAR system (essentially a simplification of the UIC system) in North America. However, geared steam locomotives do not use the notation. They are classified by their model and their number of trucks.

== Structure of the system ==
=== Basic form ===
The notation in its basic form counts the number of leading wheels, then the number of driving wheels, and finally the number of trailing wheels, numbers being separated by dashes. For example, a locomotive with two leading axles (four wheels) in front, then three driving axles (six wheels) and then one trailing axle (two wheels) is classified as a locomotive, and is commonly known as a &quot;Pacific&quot;.

=== Denotion of other locomotives ===
=== Articulated locomotives ===
For articulated locomotives that have two wheelsets, such as Garratts, which are effectively two locomotives joined by a common boiler, each wheelset is denoted separately, with a plus sign (+) between them. Thus a 4-6-2-type Garratt is a . For Garratt locomotives, the plus sign is used even when there are no intermediate unpowered wheels, e.g. the LMS Garratt . This is because the two engine units are more than just power bogies. They are complete engines, carrying fuel and water tanks. The plus sign represents the bridge (carrying the boiler) that links the two engines.

Simpler articulated types, such as Mallets, have a jointed frame under a common boiler where there are no unpowered wheels between the sets of powered wheels. Typically, the forward frame is free to swing, whereas the rear frame is rigid with the boiler. Thus, a Union Pacific Big Boy is a : four leading wheels, one group of eight driving wheels, another group of eight driving wheels, and then four trailing wheels. Sometimes articulated locomotives of this type are denoted with a “+” between each driving wheels set (so in the previous case, the Big Boy would be a 4-8+8-4). This may have been developed to distinguish articulated and duplex arrangements; duplex arrangements would get a “-“ being rigid and articulated locomotives would get a “+” being flexible. However, given all the wheel arrangements for duplex locomotives have been mutually exclusive to them, it is usually considered unnecessary and thus another “-“ is usually used.

Triplex locomotives, and any theoretical larger ones, simply expand on basic articulated locomotives, for example, 2-8-8-8-2. In the case of the Belgian quadruplex locomotive, the arrangement is listed as 0-6-2+2-4-2-4-2+2-6-0.

=== Duplex locomotives ===
For duplex locomotives, which have two sets of coupled driving wheels mounted rigidly on the same frame, the same method is used as for Mallet articulated locomotives – the number of leading wheels is placed first, followed by the leading set of driving wheels, followed by the trailing set of driving wheels, followed by the trailing wheels, each number being separated by a hyphen.

=== Tank locomotives ===
A number of standard suffixes can be used to extend the Whyte notation for tank locomotives:

=== Other steam locomotives ===
Various other types of steam locomotive can be also denoted through suffixes:
=== Internal combustion locomotives ===

The wheel arrangement of small diesel and petrol locomotives can be classified using the same notation as steam locomotives, e.g. 0-4-0, 0-6-0, 0-8-0. Where the axles are coupled by chains or shafts (rather than side rods) or are individually driven, the terms 4w (4-&quot;wheeled&quot;), 6w (6-wheeled) or 8w (8-wheeled) are generally used. For larger locomotives, the UIC classification is more commonly used.

Various suffixes are also used to denote the different types of internal combustion locomotives:
=== Electric locomotives ===
The wheel arrangement of small electric locomotives can be denoted using this notation, like with internal combustion locomotives.

Suffixes used for electric locomotives include:
== Wheel arrangement names ==
In American (and to a lesser extent British) practice, most wheel arrangements in common use were given names, sometimes from the name of the first such locomotive built. For example, the 2-2-0 type arrangement is named &quot;Planet&quot;, after the 1830 locomotive on which it was first used. (This naming convention is similar to the naming of warship classes.) Note that several wheel arrangements had multiple names, and some names were only used in some countries.

Wheel arrangements under the Whyte system are listed below. In the diagrams, the front of the locomotive is to the left.

<doc id="418183" wikidata="Q7327537" url="?curid=418183" title="The Malay Dilemma">
<text>The Malay Dilemma () is a 1970 book by Malaysian politician and writer Mahathir Mohamad, who went on to be the country&#x27;s longest serving Prime Minister.

In it, Mahathir describes his interpretation of Malaysia&#x27;s history in relation to its multi-ethnic society and racial tensions, and advocates for affirmative action policies for Malays. The book was originally banned in Malaysia; the ban was lifted 11 years after its first publication after Mahathir became prime minister. Commentators have since noted its influence on Malaysian society and governance, particularly the New Economic Policy.

== Background ==
At the time of publication, Mahathir had just lost his parliamentary seat, been expelled from the ruling party UMNO and Malaysia had recently been rocked by the racial riots later known as the 13 May Incident.

== Summary ==
The book is a manifesto outlining Mahathir&#x27;s political and racial beliefs. It analyses Malaysian history and politics in terms of race, and posits the following basic positions:

* The Malay race are the indigenous people (&quot;bumiputras&quot;) of Malaysia, and by definition follow Islamic faith
* The sole national language is the Malay language and all other races are to learn it.
* The tolerant and non-confrontational nature of the Malays has allowed them to be subjugated in their own land by the other races with the collusion of the British.
* A program of affirmative action is required to correct Malaysian Chinese hegemony in business.

The dilemma thus, was whether Malays should accept this governmental aid—and Mahathir&#x27;s position was that they should.

The book has attracted controversy for making racial generalisations, such as describing &quot;Jewish stinginess and financial wizardry&quot; and calling Jews &quot;hook-nosed&quot;. Mahathir proposes in the book that affirmative action policies be a solution leading &quot;away&quot; from violence towards a harmonious, integrated Malaysia, albeit one where political and economic power is firmly concentrated in the hands of the Malays.

== Initial ban in Malaysia ==
The book was banned in Malaysia upon its release, but was published in Singapore. Despite this, it was circulated widely. After Mahathir became prime minister in 1981, the 11-year ban was lifted after a proposal from Mahathir&#x27;s deputy Musa Hitam.

== Impact ==
The book has been posited, including by Mahathir himself, as a major influence for affirmative action policies in Malaysia, most notably in the Malaysian New Economic Policy, which outlines racial quotas across Malaysian society in favour of designated &quot;bumiputera&quot; ethnic groups.

== Reception ==
In the preface of the book&#x27;s first edition, its British publisher casts doubt on the accuracy of Mahathir&#x27;s assumptions and assertions. Mohammad Bakri Musa, in &quot;The Malay Dilemma Revisited&quot; (1999) states that his assertions and assumptions were based on his personal observations and experiences, with no empirical data to support them.

<text>Naphill is a village in the parish of Hughenden Valley, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is north-west of Hughenden, on the ridge of one of the Chiltern Hills, and is adjacent to the village of Walter&#x27;s Ash.

The origin of its name is obscure. It is sometimes thought that people napped flints here, but this is disputed.

Naphill is a mainly linear settlement, with nearly all the houses built on side-roads branching off Main Road, which is just over long.

Naphill borders the ancient parishes of Bradenham, North Dean, and West Wycombe. Whilst a village in its own right, it is part of the Parish of Hughenden, and is located around the former border between two ancient British tribes, the Catuvellauni and the Atrebates. It is close to the ancient feature Grimm&#x27;s Ditch.

Walter&#x27;s Ash in Naphill is the location of RAF Strike Command, which contains a nuclear bunker built on National Trust land in 1983–1985. This lies near the wartime Bomber Command bunker built in the 1930s. There was a peace camp during the time of the construction of the nuclear bunker, and during that time two copies of the magazine The Angry Pacifist were produced.

== Naphill Common ==
Naphill Common takes up a large part of Naphill, running the whole length of the village&#x27;s west side. It is larger and more wooded than its neighbour, Downley Common. The Common contains evidence of an industrial background, including medieval iron smelting. Pieces of iron slag have been found in the area, which was once semi-enclosed. Also pieces of pottery dated to the 12th to 15th centuries have been found turned up by rabbits.

Naphill Common is home to several very large beech and oak trees. One beech tree has grown on a medieval enclosure, the purposes of which enclosure is unknown because only three of its sides are visible. Most of the iron kilns and pottery are to be found in this part of Naphill. Originally, Naphill Common was more open, with large trees separated by grass-covered open ground, rather than the dense wood that has grown up around it.

Naphill Common is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

<text>A firecracker (cracker, noise maker, banger) is a small explosive device primarily designed to produce a large amount of noise, especially in the form of a loud bang, usually for celebration or entertainment; any visual effect is incidental to this goal. They have fuses, and are wrapped in a heavy paper casing to contain the explosive compound. Firecrackers, along with fireworks, originated in China.

==History==
The predecessor of the firecracker was a type of heated bamboo, used as early as 200 BCE, that exploded when heated continuously. The Chinese name for firecrackers, &quot;baozhu&quot; (), literally means &quot;exploding bamboo.&quot; After the invention of gunpowder, gunpowder firecrackers had a shape that resembled bamboo and produced a similar sound, so the name &quot;exploding bamboo&quot; was retained. In traditional Chinese culture, firecrackers were used to scare off enemies or evil spirits.

==Firecrackers production and sales==

===Ingredients ===

Firecrackers are generally made of cardboard or plastic, with flash powder, cordite, smokeless powder, or black powder as the propellant. This is not always the case, however. Anything from match heads to kerosene and lighter fluid has been used successfully in making firecrackers. The key to loud firecrackers, however, although in part lying in the propellant substance, is pressure. The entire firecracker must be very tightly packed in order for it to work best. Flash powder, however, does not need to be packed tightly, and should not be.

===Manufacturing===
James Dyer Ball, in his book &quot;Things Chinese,&quot; has a detailed description about the process and material used for making firecrackers at the end of the 19th century. At that time, firecrackers were made by women and children workers, using straw paper to make the body of the firecracker, while the fuse was made of paper imported from Japan made from the inner lining of the bamboo plant, or rice paper, stiffened with buckwheat paste. The bamboo paper was cut into strips of long and wide, laid on a table; a string of gunpowder was placed at the center with a hollow tube, then twisted up to make a piece of fuse. The firecracker tubes were made from pieces of straw paper wrapped around iron rods of various diameters and then tightened with a special tool. 200 to 300 firecrackers were tied up in a bunch, then red clay was spread at the bottom of the bunch and forced into each end of the firecracker with a punch; gunpowder was poured in, then the other end was sealed with an awl by turning the tube inward, and a fuse inserted.

=== Green or environment friendly firecracker===
After India&#x27;s National Green Tribunal (NGT) enacted a ban on the sale and use of crackers on Diwali festival in 2020, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) developed green crackers made from cleaner raw materials which reduce emissions by suppressing the production of dust; their emissions are 30% lower but are also of reduced loudness, at 110-125 decibels instead of the more than 160 decibels of traditional firecrackers. However, green crackers still contain harmful pollutants such as aluminium, barium, potassium nitrate and carbon.

===Sales, packaging and branding ===
Early (pre-1920s) Chinese firecrackers (also known as &quot;Mandarin firecrackers&quot;) were typically long, and approximately in diameter, and were charged with black powder. Mandarin crackers produced a less loud, duller thud compared to modern flash-light crackers (which utilize a different explosive known as flash powder). Mandarin crackers produced a dimmer, less brilliant flash when they exploded also. Individual Mandarin crackers were most often braided into &quot;strings&quot; of varying lengths, which, when ignited, exploded in rapid sequence. Generally, the strings (sometimes containing as many as several thousand crackers) would be hung from an overhead line before ignition. Most Mandarin crackers were colored all red and did not generally have designs or logos decorating their exterior surface (or &quot;shell wraps&quot;). Occasionally a few yellow and green colored Mandarin crackers were created and would be braided into the predominantly all-red strings to symbolize the emperor and the ruling class, while the numerous red crackers symbolized the common man.

Once flash powder, which produces a significantly sharper and brighter bang, replaced black powder as a firecracker&#x27;s explosive charge (circa 1924), manufacturers began competing to gain loyalty of typical consumers (that is, mainly boys 8 to 16 years old). Thousands of brands were created during the flash-light cracker&#x27;s heyday from the 1920s through the early 1970s. Only a small percentage of brands lasted more than a year or two. Collectors now seek the various labels from the era.

Until the mid-1980s, firecracker production was low-tech. They were handmade, beginning with rolling tubes. Once the firecracker tubes were rolled by hand (commonly from newspaper) and labelled, and then filled with powder, their ends were crimped and fuses inserted, all by hand. These finished firecrackers were usually braided into &quot;strings&quot; and sold in packs which came in many sizes, from the very small (&quot;penny packs&quot; containing as few as four to six firecrackers) to the most common size packs (containing 16 and 20 crackers per pack), to larger packs (containing 24, 30, 32, 40, 50, 60, 72, 90, 100, and 120 firecrackers), to huge &quot;belts&quot; and &quot;rolls&quot; (packages containing strings of several hundred to several thousand crackers—Phantom Fireworks sells rolls as large as 16,000 firecrackers). Firecracker packages were wrapped in colourful and translucent glassine paper, as well as clear cellophane, with glassine the most popular.

The final operation involved applying a branded label on each pack, then bundling finished packs into wholesale lots called &quot;bricks&quot; which contained an average of 80 packs each (varying according to the size of the packs being bundled; for example, packs of 32 crackers might have 40 packs per brick, compared to packs of 16 or 20 with 80 packs per brick).

==Usage ==
=== Laws governing production, sales and usage of firecrackers ===

Firecrackers, as well as other types of explosives, are subject to various laws in many countries, although firecrackers themselves are not usually considered illegal contraband material. It is usually the manufacture, sale, storage, and use of firecrackers that are subject to laws, including safety requirements for manufacture, the requirement of a permit to sell or store, or restrictions on the use of firecrackers.

===Celebrations ===

Firecrackers are commonly used in celebration of holidays or festivals, such as Halloween, Independence Day (also known as the Fourth of July) in the United States, Diwali in India, Eid al-Fitr in Southeast Asia, Tihar in Nepal, Day of Ashura in Morocco, Guy Fawkes Night or Bonfire Night in the United Kingdom, Halloween in Ireland, Bastille Day in France, Spanish Fallas, in almost every cultural festival of Sri Lanka (e.g. Sri Lankan New Year), New Year&#x27;s Eve and New Year&#x27;s Day, and in the celebration of Chinese New Year by Chinese communities around the world.

==Usage and legal status by country ==

The use of firecrackers, although a traditional part of the celebration, has over the years led to many injuries and deaths. There have been incidents every year of users being blinded, losing body parts, or suffering other injuries, especially during festivities that customarily involve firecrackers such as Chinese New Year season. Hence, many governments and authorities have enacted laws completely banning the sale or use of firecrackers, or banning the use of firecrackers in the street, primarily because of safety or environmental reasons.

These rules also require a permit from the local government, as well as any relevant local bodies such as maritime or aviation authorities (as relevant to the types of firecrackers being used) and hospitals, schools, etc., within a certain range.

===Australia===

In most states and territories, firecrackers are illegal without a permit and part of a display by a licensed pyrotechnician. Tasmania, ACT and Northern Territory allow consumer use with a permit (dependent on calendar date). Northern Territory is the only part of Australia where a consumer does not require a permit, but this only applies on 1 July for Territory Day.

===Canada===

Firecrackers are not authorized under the Explosives Act, thus making importation, possession, transportation, storage, or manufacturing illegal in Canada.

===Croatia===

The use of firecrackers is regulated by the &quot;Law on Explosive Substances and the Production and Trading of Weapons&quot; (). According to the Law, firecrackers (including other pyrotechnic articles) are divided into three classes: &quot;Class 1 Pyrotechnics&quot; - pyrotechnic articles for fireworks which represent a very low risk, have negligible noise level and are intended for use in restricted areas, including fireworks intended for use within residential buildings; &quot;Class 2 and 3 Pyrotechnics&quot; - pyrotechnic articles for fireworks which represent low to medium risk, have medium to high noise level and are intended for outdoor use in restricted areas and large open areas. Class 1 Pyrotechnics can be sold all year round to people over the age of 14 in general stores and newsstands, while Class 2 and 3 Pyrotechnics can only be sold between 15 December and 1 January each year at gun shops and stores with special permits to the people over the age of 14 (class 2) or over the age of 18 (class 3). Use of Class 2 and 3 Pyrotechnics is allowed only in the period between 27 December and 1 January. Each year since 1993, between 15 December and 8 January, the police carries out the &quot;Peace and good&quot; action with the aim of prevention of people from getting hurt and violating public order. The penalties for unauthorized use of pyrotechnic articles range between 1,000 and 15,000 kunas (€135 - €2,035) for people, and between 10,000 and 80,000 kunas (€1,355 - €10,850) for companies. For a legal guardian of a child under the age of 14 who have used pyrotechnic articles, fine ranges between 1,000 and 3,000 kunas (€135 - €405).

===China=== 
As of 2008, most urban areas in mainland China permit firecrackers. In the first three days of the traditional New Year, it is a tradition that people compete with each other by playing with firecrackers. However, many urban areas banned them in the 1990s. For example, they were banned in Beijing&#x27;s urban districts from 1993 to 2005. Since the ban was lifted, the firecracker barrage has been tremendous. An unusual feature is that many residents in major cities look down on street-level fireworks from their tower blocks. Bans are rare in rural areas.

===Czech Republic===

Firecrackers are legal in the Czech Republic. They can have up to 5g of flash powder and can be bought by anyone older than 21 years. For stronger firecrackers (up to 100g) a permit is required.

===Germany===

Fireworks are classified. Some fireworks are restricted to adults (18 years), may be sold to private persons only on three days before New Year&#x27;s Eve and may be used only on New Year&#x27;s Eve or New Year (special permits can be obtained to use these on other days of the year). Other fireworks have no such restrictions, however, they are not recommended for children below 12 years and guidance by adults is advised. Certain fireworks are available only to professionals.

===Finland===

Firecrackers sold to consumers are restricted to 0.95 grams of black powder. The ban on larger firecrackers went into effect in 1996. Before, mid-size &quot;kiinanpommi&quot; or &quot;kiinari&quot; (&quot;Chinese bomb&quot;) and &quot;tykinlaukaus&quot; and large &quot;tykäri&quot; (&quot;artillery shot&quot;) had become cheap and common products that were often used by children after the celebration, leading to accidents.

===Hong Kong===
Firecrackers and fireworks were banned in Hong Kong for security reasons in 1967, as a result of many IED attacks in the 1967 Leftist Riot. However, the government stages a fireworks display in Victoria Harbour for New Year countdown and the second day of the Chinese New Year.

===Hungary=== 
Firecrackers are banned in Hungary since 2005. Other types of consumer fireworks are only allowed to be sold and used on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Many people smuggle firecrackers from Slovakia, where they are legal.

===India===


Firecrackers are easily available in India and are used to mark a celebratory event. They are legal, and anyone 18 and over can buy them without a licence.

Vijayadashami and Diwali fireworks are a family event in many parts of India. People light up fireworks near their homes and in streets. Additionally, cities and communities have community fireworks.

This custom may have begun on the Indian subcontinent after 1400 CE when gunpowder started being utilised in Indian warfare.

India&#x27;s first fireworks factory was established in Calcutta during the 19th century.

In October and November, farmers from Punjab and Haryana burn agricultural waste and the weather tends not to be windy, so Delhi&#x27;s air pollution usually increases, which has been a major environmental problem in recent years. Firecrackers for the Diwali holiday can worsen this pollution. In October 2017, the Supreme Court banned firecrackers in Delhi, as a result of which the industry said it faced losses of Rs 1,000-crore and consequently layoffs.

After India&#x27;s National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered a ban in the NCR region on the sale and use of crackers in 2020, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) developed &quot;green crackers&quot; that used less polluting raw materials. Several states in India have either banned firecrackers or limited the time, noise level and type (mandatory use of less polluting firecrackers) that can be used. Nonetheless, many firecrackers were used to celebrate the Vijayadashami and Diwali holidays in 2020, immediately after which Delhi&#x27;s air pollution was over 9 times the level that the World Health Organization considers safe.

Aaratrika Bhaumik writing for the website &quot;livelaw.in&quot; mentions the ban put in place by the Calcutta High Court on firecrackers (green firecrackers included) throughout the state of West Bengal for the 2021 Vijayadashami and Diwali festivities. The ban extends to all remaining festivals in the year, such as, Chhath Puja, Kali Puja, Guru Nanak Jayanti, Christmas and New Year&#x27;s.

===Indonesia=== 
Firecrackers and fireworks are generally forbidden in public during the Chinese New Year, especially in areas with significant non-Chinese populations, to avoid conflict between the two. However, there are some exceptions. The usage of firecrackers is legal in some metropolitan areas such as Jakarta and Medan, where the degree of racial and cultural tolerance is higher.

===Ireland===

Fireworks and firecrackers are not permitted in the Republic of Ireland; however, many people smuggle them from Northern Ireland, where they are legal. They are most common around Halloween. Irish anti-firecracker laws are considered among the strictest in the world, equal to Chile&#x27;s.

===Malaysia=== 
Private citizens are banned from using fireworks in the Minor Offences Act 1955 and Explosives Act 1957. However, the illegal setting of fireworks and firecrackers are rarely enforced as they are tolerated during festive seasons. In addition, fireworks are readily available in the community.

The government only allows fireworks for public events, and some authorised events held by businesses and other groups with a permit.

===Norway=== 
The government of Norway banned the sale of rockets to individuals in early 2009, while allowing rockets to continue to be used in firework displays managed by licensed professionals. Other types of fireworks can still be sold.

===Philippines=== 
Fireworks and firecrackers are widely available throughout the Philippines and both Republic Act 7183 and Executive Order 28 were enacted to regulate and to control the sale, distribution, manufacture and use of firecrackers for public safety. Under Republic Act 7183, there are certain firecrackers that are legal such as Judas&#x27; belt and the prohibition of a certain firecracker and pyrotechnic devices shall be determined by the Director-General of the Philippine National Police. Although, there are cities in the Philippines banning all kinds of firecrackers and those cities are Muntinlupa (since 2013), Olongapo (since 2008) and Davao City (since 2001). Injuries involving the use or ingestion of &quot;Piccolo&quot; sticks account for the majority of firecracker-related incidents in the country. However, in December 2020, firecrackers were banned in some areas of Metro Manila to prevent injuries and avoid mass gatherings in the region due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Mayor Joy Belmonte of Quezon City said that fireworks and firecracker use is strictly prohibited in basketball courts, streets and public spaces, and can only be used in designated firecracker zones. Some provinces and municipalities outside of Metro Manila also imposed a firecracker ban to make sure that minimum health protocols will be observed during the new year celebration.

===Singapore===

A partial ban on firecrackers was imposed in March 1970 after a fire killed six people and injured 68. This was extended to a total ban in August 1972, after an explosion that killed two people. and an attack on two police officers attempting to stop a group from letting off firecrackers in February 1972. Since, in 2003, the government allowed firecrackers to be set off during the festive season, but only by government approved and appointed personnel. As such, private individuals are still prohibited from setting off fireworks and firecrackers. At the Chinese New Year light-up in Chinatown, at the stroke of midnight on the first day of the Lunar New Year, firecrackers are set off under controlled conditions by the Singapore Tourism Board. Other occasions where firecrackers are allowed to be set off are determined by the tourism board or other government organisations. Private sale and importation of fireworks and firecrackers is prohibited.

===Sweden===

Only rocket-type fireworks and small firecrackers are currently allowed in Sweden. The ban of firecrackers was effectuated by the EU Parliament and Swedish government effective 1 December 2001, but in 2006 the EU Parliament changed the laws, allowing smaller types of firecrackers. By 2008, the law had to be in effect in all EU member countries, including Sweden.

===Taiwan===

Firecrackers have been banned in urban areas of Taiwan since 2008, but are still allowed in rural areas.

===United Kingdom=== 
In 1997, firecrackers became illegal, but most other consumer fireworks are legal.

===United States===
According to &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, as of June 2023 49 states plus Washington, D.C. allow consumer fireworks to some degree. The types allowed vary by state. Massachusetts is the only state that prohibits fireworks in any form.

In 2007, New York City lifted its decade-old ban on firecrackers, allowing a display of 300,000 firecrackers to be set off in Chinatown&#x27;s Chatham Square. Under the supervision of the fire and police departments, Los Angeles regularly lights firecrackers every New Year&#x27;s Eve, mostly at temples and the shrines of benevolent associations. The San Francisco Chinese New Year Parade, the largest outside China, is accompanied by numerous firecrackers, both officially sanctioned and illicit.

===Vietnam===

In 1994, the Government of Vietnam decided to ban firecrackers nationwide. Only fireworks displays produced and performed by the government are permitted.

<text>Turtle (also called American Turtle) was the world&#x27;s first submersible vessel with a documented record of use in combat. It was built in 1775 by American David Bushnell as a means of attaching explosive charges to ships in a harbor, for use against the Royal Navy during the American Revolutionary War. Connecticut Governor Jonathan Trumbull recommended the invention to George Washington, who provided funds and support for the development and testing of the machine.

Several attempts were made using &quot;Turtle&quot; to affix explosives to the undersides of British warships in New York Harbor in 1776. All failed, and her transport ship was sunk later that year by the British with the submarine aboard. Bushnell claimed eventually to have recovered the machine, but its final fate is unknown. Modern replicas of &quot;Turtle&quot; have been constructed and are on display in the Connecticut River Museum, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Submarine Force Library and Museum, the Royal Navy Submarine Museum, the International Spy Museum, and the Oceanographic Museum (Monaco).

==Development==
The American inventor David Bushnell made the idea of a submersible vessel for use in lifting the British naval blockade during the American War of Independence. Bushnell may have begun studying underwater explosions while at Yale College. By early 1775, he had created a reliable method for detonating underwater explosives, a clockwork connected to a musket firing mechanism, probably a flintlock, adapted for the purpose.

After the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775, Bushnell began work near Old Saybrook on a small, individually manned submersible designed to attach an explosive charge to the hull of an enemy ship, which, he wrote Benjamin Franklin, would be, &quot;Constructed with Great Simplicity and upon Principles of Natural Philosophy.&quot;

Little is known about the origin, inspiration, and influences for Bushnell&#x27;s invention. It seems clear Bushnell knew of the work of the Dutch inventor Cornelis Drebbel. According to Dr. Benjamin Gale, a doctor who taught at Yale, the many brass and mechanical (moving) parts of the submarine were built by the New Haven clock-maker, engraver, silversmith, brass manufacturer and inventor Isaac Doolittle, whose shop was just a half block from Yale.

Though Bushnell is given the overall design credit for the &quot;Turtle&quot; by Gale and others, Doolittle was well known as an &quot;ingenious mechanic&quot; (i.e. an engineer), engraver, and metalworker. He had both designed and manufactured complicated brass-wheel hall-clocks, a mahogany printing-press in 1769 (the first made in America, after Doolittle successfully duplicated the iron screw), brass compasses, and surveying instruments. He also founded and owned a brass foundry where he cast bells. At the start of the American Revolution, the wealthy and patriotic Doolittle built a gunpowder mill with two partners in New Haven to support the war, and was sent by the Connecticut government to prospect for lead.
Though the design of the &quot;Turtle&quot; was necessarily shrouded in secrecy, based on his mechanical engineering expertise and previous experience in design and manufacturing, it seems Doolittle designed and crafted (and probably funded) the brass and the moving parts of the &quot;Turtle&quot;, including the propulsion system, the navigation instruments, the brass foot-operated water-ballast and forcing pumps, the depth gauge and compass, the brass crown hatch, the clockwork detonator for the mine, and the hand-operated propeller crank and foot-driven treadle with flywheel.

According to a letter from Dr. Benjamin Gale to Benjamin Franklin, Doolittle also designed the mine attachment mechanism, &quot;those Parts which Conveys the Powder, and secures the same to the Bottom of the Ship&quot;.

The most historically important innovation in the &quot;Turtle&quot; was the propeller, as it was the first known use of one in a watercraft: it was described as an &quot;oar for rowing forward or backward&quot;, with &quot;no precedent&quot; design and in a letter by Dr. Benjamin Gale to Silas Dean as &quot;a pair of oars fixed like the two opposite arms of a windmill&quot; and as &quot;two oars or paddles&quot; that were &quot;like the arms of a windmill... long, and about wide.&quot; As it was probably brass, it was thus likely designed and forged by Doolittle.

Doolittle also likely provided the scarce commodities of gunpowder and lead ballast as well. The wealthy Doolittle, nearly 20 years older than the Yale student Bushnell, was a founder and long time Warden of Trinity Episcopal Church on the Green, and was in charge of New Haven&#x27;s port inspection and beacon-alarm systems – suggesting that Doolittle provided much of the political and financial leadership in building the &quot;Turtle&quot; as well as its brass and moving parts.

In making the hull, Bushnell enlisted the services of several skilled artisans, including his brother, the farmer Ezra Bushnell, and ship&#x27;s carpenter Phineas Pratt, both, like David Bushnell, from Saybrook. The hull was &quot;constructed of oak, somewhat like a barrel and bound by heavy wrought-iron hoops.&quot; The shape of the hull, Gale informed Silas Deane, &quot;has the nearest resemblance to the two upper shells of a Tortoise joined together.&quot;

Named for its shape, &quot;Turtle&quot; resembled a large clam as much as a turtle; it was about long (according to the original specifications), tall, and about wide, and consisted of two wooden shells covered with tar and reinforced with steel bands. It dived by allowing water into a bilge tank at the bottom of the vessel and ascended by pushing water out through a hand pump. It was propelled vertically and horizontally by hand-cranked and pedal-powered propellers, respectively. It also had of lead aboard, which could be released in a moment to increase buoyancy. Manned and operated by one person, the vessel contained enough air for about thirty minutes and had a speed in calm water of about .

Six small pieces of thick glass in the top of the submarine provided natural light. The internal instruments had small pieces of bioluminescent foxfire affixed to the needles to indicate their position in the dark. During trials in November 1775, Bushnell discovered that this illumination failed when the temperature dropped too low. Although repeated requests were made to Benjamin Franklin for possible alternatives, none was forthcoming, and &quot;Turtle&quot; was sidelined for the winter.

Bushnell&#x27;s basic design included some elements present in earlier experimental submersibles. The method of raising and lowering the vessel was similar to that developed by Nathaniel Simons in 1729, and the gaskets used to make watertight connections around the connections between the internal and external controls also may have come from Simons, who constructed a submersible based on a 17th-century Italian design by Giovanni Alfonso Borelli.

==Preparation for use==
One of the central concerns for Bushnell as he planned and constructed the &quot;Turtle&quot; was funding.

Due to colonial efforts to keep the existence of this potential war asset secret from the British, the colonial records concerning the &quot;Turtle&quot; are often short and cryptic. Most of the records that do exist concern Bushnell&#x27;s request for funds. Bushnell met with Jonathan Trumbull, the governor of Connecticut, during 1771 seeking financial support. Trumbull also sent requests to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson, who was an inventor himself, was intrigued by the possibilities while Washington remained skeptical of devoting funds from the Continental Army, whose funding was already being stretched. Ultimately, Washington was able to provide some funds possibly due to Trumbull&#x27;s influence.

Several setbacks plagued the design process. The mine in particular was delayed several times from its expected completion from 1771 to 1776. Piloting the &quot;Turtle&quot;, moreover, required great physical stamina and coordination. The operator would have to adjust the bilge in order to keep from sinking while providing his own propulsion by use of a crank, which worked a propeller located on the front of the submarine, and direction by use of a lever that would operate and direct a rudder in the back. The cabin also reportedly held air for only thirty minutes of use. Thereafter, the operator would have to surface and replenish the air through a ventilator. Obviously, training would be needed in order to ensure the project&#x27;s success due to the complex nature of the machine. &quot;The boat was moved from Ezra&#x27;s farm on the Westbrook Road to what is now Ayer&#x27;s Point in Old Saybrook on the Connecticut River,&quot; writes historian Lincoln Diamant. Bushnell had a Yale connection here that allowed him to run trials in secrecy. Bushnell did the initial testing of his submarine here, choosing his brother, Ezra, as the pilot. Despite Bushnell&#x27;s insistence on secrecy surrounding his work, news of it quickly made its way to the British, abetted by a Loyalist spy working for New York Congressman James Duane.

In August 1776, Bushnell asked General Samuel Holden Parsons for volunteers to operate &quot;Turtle&quot;, because his brother Ezra, who had been its operator during earlier trials at Ayer&#x27;s Point on the Connecticut river, was taken ill.
Three men were chosen, and the submersible was taken to Long Island Sound for training and further trials. While these trials went on, the British gained control of western Long Island in the August 27 Battle of Long Island. Since the British now controlled the harbor, &quot;Turtle&quot; was transported overland from New Rochelle to the Hudson River. After two weeks of training, &quot;Turtle&quot; was towed to New York, and its new operator, Sgt. Ezra Lee, prepared to attack the flagship of the blockade squadron, .

Destroying this symbol of British naval power by means of a submarine would at least be a blow to British morale and, perhaps, threaten the British blockade and control of New York Harbor. The plan was to have Lee surface just behind &quot;Eagle&quot;″s rudder and use a screw to attach an explosive to the ship&#x27;s hull. Once attached, Lee would re-enter the water and make his getaway.

==Attack on the &quot;Eagle&quot;==
At 11:00 pm on September 7, 1776, Sgt. Lee piloted the submersible toward Admiral Richard Howe&#x27;s flagship, , then moored off Governors Island.

On that night, Lee maneuvered the small craft out to the anchorage. It took two hours to reach his destination, as it was hard work manipulating the hand-operated controls and foot pedals to propel the submersible into position. Adding to his difficulties was a fairly strong current and the darkness creeping overhead, which made visibility difficult.

The plan failed. Lee began his mission with only twenty minutes of air, not to mention the complications of operating the craft. The darkness, the speed of the currents, and the added complexities all combined to thwart Lee&#x27;s plan. Once surfaced, Lee lit the fuse on the explosive and tried multiple times to stab the device into the underside of the ship. Unfortunately, after several attempts Lee was not able to pierce &quot;Eagle&quot;″s hull and abandoned the operation as the timer on the explosive was due to go off and he feared getting caught at dawn. A popular story held that he failed due to the copper lining covering the ship&#x27;s hull. The Royal Navy had recently begun installing copper sheathing on the bottoms of their warships to protect from damage by shipworms and other marine life, however the lining was paper-thin and could not have stopped Lee from drilling through it. Bushnell believed Lee&#x27;s failure was probably due to an iron plate connected to the ship&#x27;s rudder hinge. When Lee attempted another spot in the hull, he was unable to stay beneath the ship, and eventually abandoned the attempt. It seems more likely that he was suffering from fatigue and carbon dioxide inhalation, which made him confused and unable to properly carry out the process of drilling through the &quot;Eagle&quot;″s hull. Lee reported British soldiers on Governors Island spotted the submersible and rowed out to investigate. He then released the charge (which he called a &quot;torpedo&quot;, the prevailing term for underwater explosive devices prior to about 1890), &quot;expecting that they would seize that likewise, and thus all would be blown to atoms.&quot; Suspicious of the drifting charge, the British retreated back to the island. Lee reported that the charge drifted into the East River, where it exploded &quot;with tremendous violence, throwing large columns of water and pieces of wood that composed it high into the air.&quot; It was the first recorded use of a submarine to attack a ship; however, the only records documenting it are American. British records contain no accounts of an attack by a submarine or any reports of explosions on the night of the supposed attack on &quot;Eagle&quot;.

According to British naval historian Richard Compton-Hall, the problems of achieving neutral buoyancy would have rendered the vertical propeller useless. The route &quot;Turtle&quot; would have had to take to attack &quot;Eagle&quot; was slightly across the tidal stream which would, in all probability, have resulted in Lee becoming exhausted. In the face of these and other problems, Compton-Hall suggests the entire story was fabricated as disinformation and morale-boosting propaganda, and if Lee did carry out an attack it was in a covered rowing boat rather than &quot;Turtle&quot;.

Despite &quot;Turtle&quot;″s failure, Washington called Bushnell &quot;a Man of great Mechanical Powers, fertile of invention and a master in execution.&quot; In retrospect, Washington observed in a letter to Thomas Jefferson, &quot;[Bushnell] came to me in 1776 recommended by Governor Trumbull (now dead) and other respectable characters…Although I wanted faith myself, I furnished him with money, and other aids to carry it into execution. He laboured for some time ineffectually and, though the advocates for his scheme continued sanguine, he never did succeed. One accident or another was always intervening. I then thought, and still think, that it was an effort of genius; but that a combination of too many things were requisite…&quot;

&quot;Turtle&quot;″s attack on &quot;Eagle&quot; reflected both the ingenuity of American forces after the fall of New York and the tendency of the weaker belligerent to adopt and embrace new, sometimes radical, technologies. &quot;What astonishment it will produce and what advantages may be made…if it succeeds, [are] more easy for you to conceive than for me to describe,&quot; physician Benjamin Gale wrote to Silas Deane less than a year before &quot;Turtle&quot;&#x27;s mission.

The submarine&#x27;s ultimate fate is not known, although it is believed that after the British took New York, the &quot;Turtle&quot; was destroyed to prevent her from falling into enemy hands.

==Aftermath==
On October 5, Sergeant Lee again went out in an attempt to attach the charge to a frigate anchored off Manhattan. He reported the ship&#x27;s watch spotted him, so he abandoned the attempt.

&quot;Turtle&quot; was lost on October 9, 1776, while aboard the sloop serving as her tender when the Royal Navy frigates , , and sank the sloop by gunfire in the Hudson River near Fort Washington on Manhattan and Fort Lee, New Jersey. Bushnell reported salvaging &quot;Turtle&quot;, but its final fate is unknown. Washington called the attempt &quot;an effort of genius&quot;, but &quot;a combination of too many things was requisite&quot; for such an attempt to succeed.

Following &quot;Turtle&quot;&#x27;s abortive attack in New York Harbor, Bushnell continued his work in underwater explosives. In 1777, he devised mines to be towed for an attack on HMS &quot;Cerberus&quot; near New London harbor and to be floated down the Delaware River in an attempt to interrupt the British fleet off Philadelphia. Both attempts failed, and the latter occupied a brief, if farcical, place in the literature of the war. Francis Hopkinson&#x27;s poem &quot;Battle of the Kegs,&quot; captured the surprising, if futile, venture: &quot;The soldier flew, the sailor too, and, scared almost to death, sir, wore out their shoes to spread the news, and ran till out of breath, sir.&quot;

When the Connecticut government refused to fund further underwater project, Bushnell joined the Continental Army as a captain-lieutenant of sappers and miners, and served with distinction for several years the Hudson River in New York. After the war, Bushnell drifted into obscurity. He visited France for several years, then moved to Georgia in 1795 under the assumed name of David Bush, where he taught school and practiced medicine. He died largely unknown in Georgia in 1824. After the war, inventors such as Robert Fulton were influenced by Bushnell&#x27;s designs in the development of underwater explosives.

Despite &quot;Turtle&quot;&#x27;s shortcomings, Bushnell&#x27;s invention marked an important milestone in submarine technology. The American inventor Robert Fulton conceived of his submarine &quot;Nautilus&quot; in the first years of the nineteenth century and took it to Europe when the United States proved largely uninterested in the design. During the American Civil War, the Confederate States of America, faced with a similar situation to that of the colonies during the War of Independence, developed an operational submarine CSS &quot;H.L. Hunley&quot;, whose destruction of the USS &quot;Housatonic&quot; in Charleston Harbor in February 1864 was the first successful submarine attack in history. By the early-twentieth century, the world&#x27;s navies were beginning to adopt submarines in larger numbers. Like Bushnell&#x27;s design, these boats mimicked the natural forms of marine animals in their hull designs. As one contemporary historian of submarines observed in 1901, the evolution of modern submarine evolved from the whale, which he deemed a &quot;submarine made by nature out of a mammal.&quot;

While Bushnell&#x27;s name is not generally well-known, he is often credited with revolutionizing naval warfare from below. Bushnell&#x27;s &quot;Turtle&quot; created a military vantage point unseen prior to the Revolutionary Wara view from under the war-stricken waters. As historian Alex Roland argues, Bushnell&#x27;s legacy as an inventor was also burnished by American writers and historians who in the early nineteenth-century lionized Bushnell and his submarine. To a new postwar generation of Americans, he seemed &quot;the ingenious patriot who invented the submarine that terrified the British.&quot; Bushnell joined the ranks of American inventors of the era such as Eli Whitney and Robert Fulton. These men served as national heroes to Americans who advocated for technological advances and idolized the men making them. &quot;Whether the motives were military pride or scientific nationalism,&quot; Roland contends, &quot;it was important to Americans in the first half century after the Revolution to look upon Bushnell&#x27;s submarine as an American original.

Yet, while the &quot;Turtle&quot; occupies a prominent place in the history of technology and military history, Roland&#x27;s scholarship points to other technological precedence that almost certainly influenced Bushnell&#x27;s design. Roland points to Denis Papin, a French physician, physicist, and member of the Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences, whose two submarines may well have served as a model for Bushnell. &quot;The submarine Bushnell designed and built... had features peculiar to both of Papin&#x27;s versions.&quot; As historian of technology Carroll Purcell argues, such trans-Atlantic technology cross-fertilization was hardly exceptional in this era.

Since the &quot;Turtle&quot;&#x27;s emergence over two centuries ago, the international playing field has leveled. The monopoly over submersible technology once held by the United States was lost over time as other navies around the world modernized and adopted submarine warfare. From the innovations of John Holland in the early twentieth century to the German U-boat campaigns of the World Wars, and the nuclear-powered ICBM submarines of the Cold War, modern navies embraced the submarine, first, for missions of reconnaissance and commerce-raiding, but, increasingly, in offensive, attack roles. In the postwar era, the submarine has become a central component of modern navies. Submarine usage has gone far beyond Bushnell&#x27;s conception of lifting naval blockades designed to bleed a country dry of their imports to become an essential arm of offensive naval warfare and power projection.

==Replicas==
The &quot;Turtle&quot; was the first submersible vessel used for combat and led to the development of what we know today as the modern submarine, forever changing underwater warfare and the face of naval warfare. As such, the &quot;Turtle&quot; has been replicated many times to show new audience the roots of submarine technology, how much it has changed, and the influence it has had on modern submarines. By the 1950s, historian of technology Brooke Hindle credited the &quot;Turtle&quot; as &quot;the greatest of the wartime inventions.&quot; The &quot;Turtle&quot; remains a source of national as well as regional pride, which led to the construction of several replicas, a number of which exist in Bushnell&#x27;s home state of Connecticut. As Benjamin Gale noted in 1775, the vessel was &quot;constructed with great simplicity,&quot; and it has thus inspired at least four replicas. Many of these followed the designs set down by Bushnell, with &quot;precise and comprehensive descriptions of his submarine,&quot; which aided the replication process.

The vessel was a source of particular pride in Connecticut. In 1976, a replica of &quot;Turtle&quot; was designed by Joseph Leary and constructed by Fred Frese as a project marking the United States Bicentennial. It was christened by Connecticut&#x27;s governor, Ella Grasso, and later tested in the Connecticut River. This replica is owned by the Connecticut River Museum.

In 2002, Rick and Laura Brown, two sculptors from Massachusetts, along with Massachusetts College of Art and Design students and faculty, constructed another replica. The Browns set out to gain a better understanding of human ingenuity while keeping Bushnell&#x27;s design, materials, and technique authentic. &quot;With it, Yankee ingenuity was born,&quot; observed Rick Brown, referring to the latest in a long line of commemoration that perceived the &quot;Turtle&quot; as something authentically American. Of the temptation to use synthetic and ahistorical materials, Rob Duarte, a MassArts student observed, &quot;It was always a temptation to use silicone to seal the thing. Then you realized that someone else had to figure this out with the same limited resources that we were using. That&#x27;s just an interesting way to learn. You can&#x27;t do it any other way than by actually doing it.&quot; The outer shell of the replica was hollowed, using controlled fire, from a Sitka spruce. The log was in diameter and shipped from British Columbia. This replica took twelve days to build and was successfully submerged in water. In 2003, it was tested in an indoor test tank at the United States Naval Academy. Lew Nuckols, a professor of Ocean Engineering at USNA, made ten dives, noting &quot;you feel very isolated from the outside world. If you had any sense of claustrophobia it would not be a very good experience.&quot; The replica is currently on display at the International Spy Museum in Washington, DC.

In 2003, Roy Manstan, Fred Frese, and the Naval Underwater Warfare Center partnered with students from Old Saybrook High School in Connecticut on a four-year project called The Turtle Project, to construct their own working replica, which they completed and launched in 2007.

On August 3, 2007 three men were stopped by police while escorting and piloting a replica based on the &quot;Turtle&quot; within 200 feet (61 m) of RMS &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;, then docked at the cruise ship terminal in Red Hook, Brooklyn. The replica was created by New York artist Philip &quot;Duke&quot; Riley and two residents of Rhode Island, one of whom claimed to be a descendant of David Bushnell. Riley claimed that he wanted to film himself next to the &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot; for his upcoming gallery show. Riley&#x27;s was not an exact replica, however, measuring tall and made of cheap plywood then coated with fiberglass. Its portholes and hatch were collected from a marine salvage company. He also installed pumps to allow him to add or remove water for ballast. Riley christened his vessel &quot;Acorn&quot;, to note the deviation from Bushnell&#x27;s original design. The vessel, reported the New York Times, &quot;resembled something out of Jules Verne by way of Huck Finn, manned by cast members from &#x27;.&#x27; The Coast Guard issued Riley a citation for having an unsafe vessel, and for violating the security zone around &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;. The NYPD also impounded the submarine. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, calling this an incident of &quot;marine mischief&quot; assured the public that this was simply an art project and did not, in fact, represent a terrorist threat to the passenger ship.

In 2015, the replica built by Manstan and Frese in 2007 for The Turtle Project was acquired by Privateer Media and used in the television series &quot;.&quot; The submarine was shipped to Richmond, VA where it underwent a full refit and was relaunched for film use in the water. Additional full-scale interior and exterior models were also made by AMC as part of the production.

Also in 2015, Privateer Media used The Turtle Project replica for the Travel Channel series Follow Your Past, hosted by Alison Stewart. Filming took place in August where the submarine was launched with a tether in the Connecticut River in the town of Essex, CT.

<doc id="418192" wikidata="Q11789832" url="?curid=418192" title="Nash, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Nash is a village and also a civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, within the Buckinghamshire Council unitary authority area. It is in the north of the county, about south-west of Milton Keynes and east of Buckingham. According to the 2011 census, the population total of Nash was 417.

== History ==
The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &quot;at the ash-tree&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Esse&quot;. The name went through &#x27;Ash&#x27; and &#x27;La Nash&#x27; to &#x27;Nash&#x27;. Between 1870 and 1872, Nash was described as

&quot;NASH, a hamlet in Whaddon parish, Bucks; 5½ miles E of Buckingham. Acres, 1, 430. Real property, £1, 813, Pop., 462. Houses, 103. The property is divided chiefly among five. The hamlet forms chief part of the chapelry of Thornton-cum-Nash; and contains the church of that chapelry, a Baptist chapel, and a national school. Nash Common is a meet for the Whaddon Chase hounds.&quot;Nash was designated a civil parish between 1896 and 1899. Before this it was classed as a hamlet within the parish of Whaddon.

Although there has never been a separate manor in Nash, the manor in neighbouring Whaddon has historically been referred to as the manor of Whaddon and Nash. The earliest mention of the manor pre-dates the modern name of &#x27;Nash&#x27;, and refers to the manor as that of &#x27;Whaddone with Esse&#x27;.

== Government ==
The village is served by a parish council of seven members, who are elected every four years, with the next elections set to take place in 2019. However much of the parish council&#x27;s role is to advise the Aylesbury Vale District Council and Buckinghamshire County Council who make most of the decisions with regards to maintenance and planning.

The village is part of the Great Horwood ward of the Aylesbury Vale District Council. At the county level, the village is part of the Winslow electoral division. Its parliamentary constituency is Buckingham.

== Geography ==
The village is located 46 miles (75 km) north west of London and is about above sea level.

According to the British Geological Survey, the bedrock consists of Mudstone with superficial deposits of sand and gravel from river terraces and glaciofluvia deposits.

The first Land Utilisation Survey of Britain in the 1930s, found the land around Nash to be predominantly &#x27;Meadowland and Permanent Grass&#x27;, with some areas of &#x27;Forest and Woodland&#x27;.

== Demography ==
The most recent, 2011, census of the UK put the total population of Nash at 417. The population has grown sharply since the lowest recorded population total of 214, which was found in the 1961 census. The population previously went through a long period of decline between 1871 (when the highest total population of 460 was recorded) and 1961.

The ethnic composition of Nash is overwhelmingly white, with just 14 individuals identifying as being from other ethnic groups in the 2011 census. Just over 60% of the population identify as Christian, whilst more than 37% either stated that they are not religious, or did not state their religion.

The 2011 census also recorded that 43% of the population were in full-time employment, and 11.4% in part-time employment. Just 2% of the population were identified as being unemployed, which is lower than the average for Aylesbury Vale (3.1%), and England (4.4%).

== Economy ==
Of the 212 members of the population in employment, the majority appear to commute to work, with some of the highest employing industries including &#x27;Wholesale and Retail Trade; Repair of Motor Vehicles and Motor Cycles&#x27; (18.9%) and &#x27;Manufacturing&#x27; (9.4%), neither of which take place within the village. Other sectors with high levels of employment include &#x27;Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities&#x27; (13.2%) and &#x27;Education&#x27; (12.7%).

This contrasts greatly from some of the traditional industries which were previously common in the village. In 1881, the main industries of the parish were agriculture (40% of the population), and textiles (31% of the population).

== Culture and community ==
=== Community facilities ===
After the village school closed in 1948, the building was converted into a community hall for the use of the villagers. The hall is also available for hire, and is used to host several community events throughout the year, as well as the local youth club each week.

=== Landmarks ===
The All Saints Church in Nash dates from 1857 when the foundation stone was laid. It was based on designs by renowned architect George Edmund Street.

== Education ==
Nash has not had its own school since it closed in 1948. It now sits within the catchment area of schools in local villages. For aged 4 to 7 this is Whaddon Church of England School, and for 7+ it is covered by Great Horwood Church of England School.

<doc id="418194" wikidata="Q5116880" url="?curid=418194" title="Church of God (Holiness)">
<text>The Church of God (Holiness) is an association of autonomous holiness Christian congregations. Originating in the 19th century as an outgrowth of the Methodist Episcopal Church, it teaches Wesleyan (Methodist) doctrine and is aligned with conservative holiness movement. At its founding in 1883, the Church of God sought to actualize the New Testament church. With respect to ecumenism, the Church of God is a member of the Global Wesleyan Alliance and Interchurch Holiness Convention.

==History==
The Church of God (Holiness) began on March 29, 1883, with the founding of a church in Centralia, Missouri with 44 members. Those involved in this effort were: J. F. Watkins, N. T. Sneed, H. A. Foster, G. R. Sneed, F. H. Sumter, J. B. Ceighton, J. H. Allen, D. C. Brenneman, G. W. Petty, Isaiah Reid, T. B. Bratton, A. L. Brewer, A. M. Kiergan, and W. T. Bean. The name &quot;Church of God&quot; was chosen as its adherents felt that this was the Scriptural name for the body; its people opposed the idea of denominationalism, holding that &quot;all who were genuinely converted were a part of the true church&quot; and that &quot;each individual was accountable to a local body of believers.&quot; The movement grew out of a group of former members of the Methodist Episcopal Church that had been participating in the Southwestern Holiness Association. A cause of their departure from the Methodist Episcopal Church was their zealous propagation of the instantaneous aspect of entire sanctification, in contrast to the Methodist Episcopal Church, which taught that entire sanctification could be received either instantaneously or progressively. One of the early leaders was John Petit Brooks (1826–1915), who was editor of &quot;The Church Witness&quot;, which subsequently merged with &quot;The Good Way&quot;, to become the &quot;Church Herald&quot;, which later merged with the &quot;Church Advocate and Holiness Banner&quot; to become &quot;The Church Herald and Holiness Banner&quot;. He left the Methodist Episcopal Church circa 1886.

==Beliefs==
The idea of church is for believers to come together as a body, and to have fellowship with other believers. God desires that we come to Him with a repentant heart and a desire to know Him more fully.

==Organization==
The Church of God (Holiness) has about 120 congregations in the United States, with the majority in Missouri and Kansas. Additionally they have 12 congregations on the Navajo Reservation, 13 Spanish-speaking congregations in California, Texas, New York and Colorado, a Korean ministry in Overland Park, Kansas, and two Haitian works in New York and Florida. The church also has a sizeable outgrowth in the Cayman Islands. Ministry departments of the church include Home Missions, World Missions, Harmony Hill Youth Ministries, and the Herald and Banner Press. Headquarters are located in Overland Park, Kansas. A general church conference is held annually in Overland Park. World missions works are found in Bolivia, the British West Indies, the Virgin Islands, Ghana, Nigeria, India, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Colombia, Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica, and Ukraine.

==Ecumenism==
With respect to ecumenism, the Church of God is a member of the Global Wesleyan Alliance and the Interchurch Holiness Convention.

==Education==
The Church of God (Holiness) is associated with Kansas Christian College in Overland Park. This institution gives degrees in ministry, business leadership, psychology, and education. The headquarters for the church is located on the campus and the General Camp and Convention are also held here.
The church is also associated with several private elementary and secondary schools. These are El Dorado Christian School in Eldorado Springs, Missouri; Fort Scott Christian Heights in Fort Scott, Kansas; Gravette Holiness Bible School in Gravette, Arkansas; Lowry City Christian School in Lowry City, Missouri; Mount Zion Bible School in Ava, Missouri; Mountain State Christian School in Culloden, West Virginia; and Overland Christian Schools in Overland Park.

<doc id="418200" wikidata="Q6966791" url="?curid=418200" title="Nash Lee">
<text>Nash Lee is a hamlet in the parish of Wendover, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located to the north of the village, about two miles west of Wendover.

The hamlet name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;clearing among the ash trees&#x27;. It was referred to in 12th century manorial records as &quot;Escelee&quot;.

Today little remains of Nash Lee apart from a farm and some houses. The feel of the hamlet was altered greatly in the construction of the nearby Wendover Bypass and the rerouting of adjacent roads to accommodate the new construction. All that marks Nash Lee today is the road name Nash Lee Lane.

<text>Terrick (formerly Terwick) is a hamlet in the parish of Ellesborough, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located in the north of the parish, where the lane leading to Chequers meets the main road from Stoke Mandeville to Little Kimble.

The hamlet name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;Teofer&#x27;s farm&#x27;.

Today the community of Terrick is small, but close-knit. Terrick is the location of the Chiltern Brewery Company, who have operated in the hamlet for thirty years. The hamlet name lends itself to Terrick Truckle a cheese that they produce; and Terrick Beef, traditional English meat produced by a local farmer.</text><links>
