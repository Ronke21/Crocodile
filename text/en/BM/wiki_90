<text>Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club, known as the Sydney Roosters are an Australian professional rugby league football club based in Sydney&#x27;s Eastern Suburbs. The club competes in the National Rugby League (NRL) competition. The Roosters have won fifteen New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) and National Rugby League titles, and several other competitions. First founded as the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club (ESDRLFC), it is the only club to have played in every season at the elite level, and since the 1970s has often been dubbed the glamour club of the league. The Sydney Roosters have won 15 premierships, equal to the record of the St George Dragons. Only the South Sydney Rabbitohs have won more premierships. The club holds the record for having won more matches than any other in the league, the most minor premierships and the most World Club Challenge trophies. Currently coached by Trent Robinson and captained by James Tedesco, the Roosters play home games at the Sydney Football Stadium.

The club was founded in 1908 in Paddington, Sydney, as Eastern Suburbs; in 1995 the club&#x27;s name was changed to the Sydney City Roosters, and in 2000 to the Sydney Roosters. The team&#x27;s Leagues Club is based in Bondi Junction and its home ground, administration and training facilities are located at nearby Moore Park. The Roosters have long-standing and fierce rivalries with other Sydney-based clubs, especially the South Sydney Rabbitohs, a fellow foundation club based in neighbouring Redfern.

==History==
The Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club (ESDRLFC) was formed on 24 January 1908 at a meeting at the Paddington Town Hall in Sydney after it was decided that the district should enter a team in the newly formed New South Wales Rugby Football League. The ESDRLFC was formed, under its articles of association with the NSWRFL, to represent the geographic areas in Sydney covering the Waverley, Randwick, Woollahra, Paddington and Vaucluse local government municipalities, as well as the eastern parts of the Sydney CBD. 

Unofficially nicknamed the &quot;Tricolours&quot; due to the red, white and blue playing strip, Eastern Suburbs won its first match, defeating Newtown 32–16 at Wentworth Oval on 20 April 1908. In 1913 it became the first club to win three consecutive premierships; the line-ups during this period included the likes of Dally Messenger, Harry &quot;Jersey&quot; Flegg and Sandy Pearce, all regarded as all-time rugby league greats. However, the club rapidly declined and failed to win the premiership for the next nine seasons.

Eastern Suburbs missed the finals once from 1926 to 1942, and in that time won four titles and the minor premiership on seven occasions. During this period, Dave Brown set several point-scoring records that still stand. In 1935, the team lost just one game, and recorded the highest winning margin in their history, an 87–7 (equivalent to 106–8 using the modern scoring system) victory over Canterbury. In 1936, Eastern Suburbs became one of five teams in premiership history to remain undefeated for an entire season, a feat they repeated the following year. It is the only club to remain unbeaten for two consecutive seasons.

Despite claiming the premiership in 1945, Eastern Suburbs failed to make the finals for the following seven seasons. A runners-up finish in 1960 was the closest the club came to claiming the premiership during this era. Eastern Suburbs were soundly defeated 31–6 in the grand final that year, by the famous record-beating St George outfit. In 1966, the club fell to new depths and was winless for the first time in its history. It was also the last occasion in which the Roosters won the wooden spoon until claiming it again in the 2009 season. It ended a poor run for Eastern Suburbs; from 1963 to 1966, they won 8 of 72 matches, finishing second to last in 1964 and last in the other three years. The club underwent a renaissance in 1967 after appointing Jack Gibson as coach (1967–68), and introducing a new emblem on the playing jerseys, the rooster.

From 1972 to 1982, the Roosters won four minor premierships and played in four grand finals, winning two consecutively. Gibson, now dubbed as &quot;Super Coach&quot;, returned to lead the team from 1974 to 1976. In 1974 and 1975, the team won 39 of 44 matches, both minor premierships and both grand finals and set a premiership record of 19 consecutive wins. The 38–0 grand final victory in 1975 against St George was the largest margin in a first grade grand final, and the record stood for 33 years until superseded by Manly&#x27;s 40–0 win over the Melbourne Storm in 2008. Although the 1975 grand final was played during an era of a now-obsolete scoring system - with 3 points awarded for a try - the scoreline using 4 points for tries would mean that the record winning margin for a grand final would still hold with an adjusted score of 46–0. With line-ups including Mark Harris, Elwyn Walters, John Brass, Bill Mullins, Russell Fairfax, Johnny Mayes, John Peard, Ron Coote, Ian Schubert and captain Arthur Beetson, the Centenary of Rugby League panel considered the Roosters of 1974 and 1975 to be among the greatest club teams of all time.

Between 1984 and 1995, the Roosters reached the semi-finals once, and became known to critics as the &quot;transit lounge&quot;, due to the high frequency of player purchases and releases. The club came close to reaching the premiership in 1987 under coach and favourite son Arthur Beetson, being defeated by eventual premiers Manly in a &quot;bruising&quot; major semi-final, 10–6.

As the Super League war built up in the mid-1990s, the Roosters recruited high-profile coach Phil Gould and star five-eighth Brad Fittler, both from the Penrith Panthers. This helped to quickly send the Roosters back to the upper end of the ladder. Fittler&#x27;s presence proved invaluable; during his reign, the Roosters competed in four grand finals in five years. In 2002, the club captured its 12th premiership – the first in 27 years – defeating Minor Premiers the New Zealand Warriors 30–8 in the 2002 NRL grand final.

In the 2003 NRL grand final against the Penrith Panthers, the Roosters lost 18–6 in what was their heaviest defeat for the year. A decisive moment occurred midway through the second half: with the scores tied at 6-all, Roosters winger Todd Byrne made a clear break down the sideline and looked set to score a try before being chased down and tackled into touch by Penrith lock forward, Scott Sattler. From then on, the momentum of the game was with Penrith. The Roosters&#x27; made the Grand Final in 2004, when they ceded a 13–6 half-time lead to be defeated by the Bulldogs 16–13. The match was captain Fittler&#x27;s last for the team.
In 2007, the Roosters became the first club to play 100 seasons of first grade rugby league; having been the only outfit to play in each season since the competition&#x27;s inception in 1908. They appointed Chris Anderson as coach in 2007 and 2008 following two relatively unsuccessful years under Ricky Stuart. On 9 July 2007, Anderson resigned after a 56–0 loss to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. Assistant Coach Fittler acted as the caretaker for the remainder of the 2007 season, before being appointed in August to the top job for two years. With eight rounds remaining in a disappointing 2009 season in which the Roosters finished with the wooden spoon for the first time in 43 years, Fittler was informed he would not be the coach in 2010, his position to be taken by veteran coach Brian Smith. The Roosters wound up winning only five games for the entire season; twice against Cronulla and once against each of Canberra in Canberra, eventual grand finalists Parramatta and Newcastle in Newcastle.

A year after finishing last, under the coaching of Brian Smith they reached the 2010 NRL Grand Final where the St. George Illawarra Dragons defeated them 32–8. The Roosters led 8–6 at half time but were overrun in the second half.

What followed was another relatively disappointing season at Bondi Junction, with the Roosters finishing 11th in a 2011 season plagued by off-field issues involving 2010 Dally M Medallist Todd Carney (who was later sacked by the Roosters at season&#x27;s end). However, a four-game winning streak to end the season brought hope for the 2012 season. Other high-profile players including Nate Myles, Mark Riddell, Jason Ryles, Kane Linnett, and Phil Graham all left the club at season&#x27;s end.

The Roosters endured a disappointing 2012 season, finishing 13th. Brian Smith resigned from the coaching role shortly after the Roosters&#x27; season concluded with a loss to the Minor Premiers Canterbury, and also at season&#x27;s end captain Braith Anasta left to join the Wests Tigers in 2013.

The 2013 season saw new staff, a new coach, Trent Robinson, and several new players, including big signings Michael Jennings, James Maloney, Luke O&#x27;Donnell and Sonny Bill Williams, arrive at the club. This culminated in the Roosters finishing the 2013 season with a 24–12 win over the South Sydney Rabbitohs, securing the Minor Premiership for the 2013 season and were the NRL&#x27;s best attacking and defensive team. The Roosters defeated the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles 4–0, in week one of the finals, earning a week&#x27;s rest. The Roosters defeated the Newcastle Knights 40–14 in week three of the NRL finals, progressing to the 2013 NRL grand final, facing the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, winning 26–18. It was a great comeback by the Roosters, down by 10 points in the second half they went on to score three consecutive tries to seal the win and their 13th premiership. They then went on to win the 2014 World Club Challenge against Wigan 36–14 to claim the treble of club titles. No team in premiership history had come from a lower ladder position to win the following season&#x27;s title.

In the 2014 season, the club finished first on the table winning the Minor Premiership. In the Preliminary Final against arch rivals Souths, Sydney lost the match 32–22 in what was retiring legend Anthony Minichiello&#x27;s final game. In the 2015 season, Sydney finished first on the table and claimed their third consecutive Minor Premiership. The Roosters again made the Preliminary Final with Brisbane this time being the opponents. The Roosters ended up losing the match 31–12 in front of a sold-out crowd at Suncorp Stadium.

In the 2016 season, the Roosters finished 15th on the table after enduring a horror season where star player Mitchell Pearce was suspended for 8 matches, fined $A125,000 and stripped of the captaincy following a pre season incident where Pearce was intoxicated, simulated a sex act with a dog which was filmed on another party goer&#x27;s mobile phone. The club also struggled due to injuries to star players such as Boyd Cordner and Jared Waerea-Hargreaves.

The Roosters finished 2nd at the end of the 2017 season and defeated Brisbane in week one of the finals earning the week off. Sydney&#x27;s opponents in the Preliminary Final were North Queensland who had finished in 8th position on the table and produced upset victories over Cronulla and Parramatta. In a game that the Roosters were expected to win, the Cowboys surprised everyone winning the match 29–16.

In 2018, the Sydney Roosters finished in first place during the regular season, claiming their 20th Minor Premiership. They beat Cronulla-Sutherland 21–12 in week one of the finals, earning the week off.

In March 2018, the NRL announced that the club had been successful in their bid for a team in the inaugural NRL Women&#x27;s competition set to start in September of that year. This inclusion made Eastern Suburbs the only double foundation club in the league. The team would finish the season in second place, losing in the Grand Final to the Brisbane Broncos.

The club then broke its preliminary final hoodoo by beating rivals South Sydney 12–4 in what was the last sports match ever played at the Sydney Football Stadium. They managed to keep Souths tryless, and the crowd was the largest ever recorded in a sporting match at the Sydney Football Stadium with 44,380 people in attendance. The Roosters played Melbourne in the 2018 NRL Grand Final, and won 21–6 to claim their 14th premiership.

The Roosters started the 2019 NRL season with a round 1 loss against rivals Souths at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The club then went on an eight-game winning run and defeated Melbourne 21–20 in the grand final rematch which was played at AAMI Park. The Roosters also scored impressive victories over Brisbane 36–4 and Wests 42–12 which were both played at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Midway through the 2019 NRL season, Sydney suffered a drop in form during the 2019 State of Origin series period before recovering by winning 7 of their last 8 matches of the season to finish 2nd behind minor premiers Melbourne. The Roosters defeated rivals South Sydney and Melbourne to reach the 2019 NRL Grand Final. In the grand final, Sydney won their second consecutive premiership after a hard-fought victory against Canberra at ANZ Stadium. It was the first time that a team had won consecutive premierships in a unified competition since Brisbane achieved the feat in the 1992 and 1993 seasons.

The club began the 2020 NRL season once again as one of the teams to beat for the premiership but suffered back to back losses to start the year before the season was interrupted due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. After the return to play, the club won five matches in a row and only lost three matches between round 8 and round 20.

The Roosters finished the season in 4th place and qualified for the finals. In week one of the finals, they were defeated by minor premiers Penrith which forced them into an elimination final match against Canberra. The Roosters quest for a third straight premiership was ended as they lost against Canberra 22–18 at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

The club began the 2021 NRL season as one of the teams tipped to challenge for the premiership. In the opening two rounds of the year, the club defeated both Manly and the Wests Tigers by 40 points. Throughout the season however, the club suffered one of the biggest injury tolls in recent history losing Jake Friend, Boyd Cordner and Brett Morris to retirement and season ending injuries to Luke Keary, Lindsay Collins, Joseph Manu and Billy Smith. The Roosters were forced to blood nine debutants, including the likes of Sam Walker, Ben Marschke, Egan Butcher and Fletcher Baker and call upon players from the club&#x27;s feeder side the North Sydney Bears. The club also suffered injuries and suspensions to other key players such as Victor Radley.

The Roosters ended the 2021 NRL season in fifth place and qualified for the finals. In week one of the finals, the club defeated the Gold Coast 25–24. The following week, the Roosters season ended after losing 42–6 against Manly. In the 2022 NRL season, the club finished sixth on the table. The Sydney Roosters won eight straight matches late in the season, but were knocked out in the first week of the finals. The Sydney Roosters entered the 2023 NRL season as one of the favourites to take out the competition but by round 20, the club were sat 14th on the table. The tri-colours then went on to win their remaining five matches of the season against also-rans Manly, the Dolphins, Parramatta, Wests Tigers and lastly arch-rivals South Sydney to finish 7th on the table. In week one of the finals, the club would defeat an out of sorts Cronulla side to reach the second week with their opponent being Melbourne. Melbourne were heavy favourites going into the game but with only minutes remaining the Sydney Roosters were in front 13–12 before Melbourne scored a try through William Warbrick to win the match 18–13. The match wasn&#x27;t without controversy due to Melbourne scoring a try in the first half which came directly after Harry Grant had knocked the ball on from a cross-field kick, which was not called by referee Ashley Klein.
In the 2024 NRL season, the club would finish third on the table and qualify for the finals. The club would eventually reach the preliminary final but were soundly beaten by Melbourne 48-18.

==Emblem==

Eastern Suburbs did not traditionally sport a crest on their jerseys in the first half of the 20th century. Other clubs occasionally sported simple designs on their strip; however, this was not seen consistently on all jerseys until the 1950s and 1960s. In 1967, the club introduced its first logo, displaying the mantra &quot;Easts to Win&quot;, following a winless season. The crest also incorporated a rooster or cockerel in the design; one source suggested that this choice of mascot followed after the Roosters&#x27; jersey design was inspired by the French national team&#x27;s jersey. Given that the French team&#x27;s mascot was affectionately known to supporters as &quot;le coq&quot;, &quot;the rooster&quot;, connections have been made as to the choosing of a rooster for Eastern Suburbs&#x27; mascot.

In 1978, the mantra was replaced with the team&#x27;s name, &quot;Eastern Suburbs&quot;. This name was kept until 1994, when the club changed its team name to the &quot;Sydney City Roosters&quot; for the start of the 1995 season to appeal to the club&#x27;s widening fan base. In 2000, the club shortened its name to the &quot;Sydney Roosters&quot;.

Although marketing names have changed, the Roosters are still registered with the National Rugby League competition as the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club, the entity holding the NRL licence.

==Colours==
Red, white and blue have been the colours of every jersey design in the club&#x27;s history; however, the jersey design has undergone several alterations. During World War II, the design of the jersey was modified because the dye used to colour jerseys was needed for the war effort. This saw Eastern Suburbs playing in different colours and an altered design. Instead of using the traditional hoops, the side used a sky-blue based jersey and a red and white V-strip around the collar. This is the only noted time in the club&#x27;s history where the traditional deep blue, red and white combination was absent from the jersey. After the war, the V-strip design reverted to the original blue that had been present in the original jerseys, and the single red and white stripes around the shirt&#x27;s chest were incorporated with a single white stripe surrounded by a red stripe on either side. This jersey appeared in the 1950s and remains the team&#x27;s base design.

===Primary jerseys===

==Rivals==
Main: South Sydney Rabbitohs.

Major: St. George Illawarra Dragons, Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Melbourne Storm.

Minor: Penrith Panthers, Manly Warringah Sea Eagles, Brisbane Broncos, Parramatta Eels, Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks.

==Head-to-head records==

==Stadium==
Most sources suggest that the Royal Agricultural Ground was often used as a home venue between 1908 and 1910, before the club hosted matches at the Sydney Sports Ground from 1911 onwards. It was here that the team played almost all of their home games up until 1986, when the ground was demolished with the Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2 to make way for Sydney&#x27;s main rectangular field, the Sydney Football Stadium. In 1987, games were moved away to the Newtown Jets&#x27; home ground, Henson Park, temporarily to await the completion of the Sydney Football Stadium. The team capitalised on this move, and under coach Arthur Beetson finished second in the regular season, and narrowly missed playing in the grand final. It was the only time between 1983 and 1995 that the club reached the finals.

In 1988, the club moved its home ground to the newly built Sydney Football Stadium on the site of the old Sydney Sports Ground, opening the season with a 24–14 defeat at the hands of the St George Dragons in front of 19,295 spectators on a wet night on 4 March 1988. At the Sydney Football Stadium, the Roosters have a 59% win record from 256 games with a 58% and 55% win record at former home grounds the Sydney Sports Ground and the Sydney Cricket Ground respectively.

The Roosters played their last game, a Preliminary Final against South Sydney, at the Sydney Football Stadium on 22 September 2018 in front of a ground record crowd of 44,380. In 2019, the Sydney Roosters home became the Sydney Cricket Ground whilst the replacement Sydney Football Stadium (2022) was being built.

==Supporters==

While the Sydney Roosters have supporters outside of its traditional area, its main fan base is in Sydney, which in the early days was concentrated in Sydney&#x27;s Eastern Suburbs but has now branched out due to the changing demographics of that region with most fans of the club coming from outside the traditional area. Due to the affluence of the Eastern Suburbs, the Roosters fanbase is often perceived as affluent White Collar and Upper Class, although the club (Like other Rugby League clubs) was formed mostly by players with a working class background

They have an estimated 800k fans due to a club estimate. When calculating their &#x27;average exposure value&#x27; across the 2019, 2020 and 2021 seasons it was determined that they were the most watched NRL club and the third most watched club across all sporting codes in Australia. They had 18.6 million game views in 2021 alone.

In 2013 the club tallied the fourth-highest home attendance of all National Rugby League clubs (behind the Brisbane Broncos) with an average of 19,368 spectators at the Sydney Football Stadium. This figure does not factor in whether supporters are from the home or away team. Following the opening of the new Sydney Football Stadium, during the 2023 season the Roosters recorded the third-highest average home attendance in the NRL and the highest outside of Queensland with an average of 22,898.

At the club&#x27;s home ground, the Sydney Football Stadium, the supporters congregate in distinct sections. The &quot;Chook Pen&quot;, a designated area in Bay 35, is the preferred location for the most animated fans. Members of the Sydney Cricket and Sports Ground Trust are seated in the Members Pavilion, and season ticket holders are located in Bays 12–14.

In 2023, the Roosters had over 20,072 paying members which ranked them with the fifth most memberships out of the nine Sydney teams, in addition to the 46,486 members of the Easts Leagues Club, which is the major benefactor of the football club. The Easts Leagues Club and the Sydney Roosters &quot;operate as one entity&quot; known as the Easts Group. Under this arrangement, the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club is the &#x27;parent company&#x27; of the Easts Group. The Football Club delegates, however, overarching responsibility for both football and leagues club operations to a single general manager who oversees the group&#x27;s performance. The leagues club provides financial support to the football club only when necessary as the football club&#x27;s sponsorships and TV revenues are generally adequate to cover most Rugby League expenditures.

==Statistics and records==

Jared Waerea-Hargreaves holds the record for the most first grade games (307), having surpassed Mitchell Aubusson&#x27;s tally of 306 matches in round 19 of the 2024 season. Former team captain Craig Fitzgibbon holds the club record for scoring the most points, tallying 1,376 over his 210 matches. Fitzgibbon also broke the all-time point scoring record for a forward in the later rounds of 2006. Dave Brown&#x27;s tally of 45 points (five tries and 15 goals) in a single match against Canterbury in 1935 remains a competition record after more than seven decades. Ivan Cleary scored 284 points in 1998, which at the time was an all-time points scoring record in a season.

Bill Mullins, father of 2002 premiership player Brett, scored 104 tries in his 11-year, 190-game career with Eastern Suburbs between 1968 and 1978, meaning that on average, he scored at least one try every two games. Anthony Minichiello became the highest try scorer in the Roosters history when he scored his 105th try against the Newcastle at Ausgrid Stadium in June 2011. &#x27;Mini&#x27; finally retired after the 2014 season, and ended his career with 139 tries. He is also the first fullback in 70 years to win the Grand Final (2013), while captaining the club. Rod O&#x27;Loan scored seven tries in a single match against Sydney University in 1935, and Dave Brown&#x27;s 38 tries in 15 games in the same year remains a competition record.

In 1975, the Eastern Suburbs Roosters set a record 19-match winning streak on their way to their 11th premiership. In a 1935 match against Canterbury, Dave Brown scored 45 points, the highest score and victory margin for the club (the 87–7 scoreline is equivalent to 106–8 under the contemporary scoring system). The winning margin is the second largest overall, behind St. George&#x27;s 91–6 win over Canterbury a week earlier.

The club&#x27;s record attendance for a regular season game at its home ground—the Sydney Football Stadium—stands at 40,864, achieved in a match on ANZAC Day against the St George Illawarra Dragons in 2017. The club&#x27;s record attendance for a regular season game at the SCG stands at 50,130 on 4 May 1974 against the Manly Sea Eagles
The 2000 grand final between the Sydney Roosters and the Brisbane Broncos attracted 94,277 spectators to the Olympic Stadium.

Jamie Feeney was appointed the head coach for the 2020 season, being determined to turn the club&#x27;s fortunes around. He was assisted by Kylie Hilder and John Strange. Feeney immediately appointed Corban McGregor as the club&#x27;s new captain. The club also announced the big signing of Sevens Rugby star and 2016 Gold Medalist, Charlotte Caslick.

<text>Synopsys, Inc. is an American electronic design automation (EDA) company headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, that focuses on silicon design and verification, silicon intellectual property and software security and quality. Synopsys supplies tools and services to the semiconductor design and manufacturing industry. Products include tools for logic synthesis and physical design of integrated circuits, simulators for development, and debugging environments that assist in the design of the logic for chips and computer systems.

== History ==
Synopsys was founded by Aart de Geus, David Gregory and Bill Krieger in 1986 in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The company was initially established as Optimal Solutions with a charter to develop and market logic synthesis technology developed by the team at General Electric&#x27;s Advanced Computer-Aided Engineering Group. The company changed its name to Synopsys and moved to Mountain View, California in 1987. It became a public company through an initial public offering in February 1992.

The company built a supercomputer using commodity Linux servers and off-the-shelf hardware in 2006 to develop and run EDA applications with intense computational requirements. With LINPACK benchmark results topping 3.7 teraflops, the supercomputer made it to the TOP500 list, ranked 242nd most powerful at the time.

Synopsys has been a constituent of the Nasdaq-100 and S&amp;P 500 indices since 2017. Also in 2017, the company established a $100 million strategic investment fund for the Chinese market.

In 2018, according to the Center for Security and Emerging Technology, Synopsys partnered with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army National Defence University to provide field-programmable gate array design training. Synopsys also sells EDA software to companies under the control of Chinese regional governments.

The company launched a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) software tool, DSO.ai, for chip design in early 2020. The AI approach, which uses reinforcement learning, allows the tool to automatically decide how best to place and route blocks of circuitry on a chip. In March 2023, the company rolled out AI-based tools used in the other stages of chip design, including VSO.ai for verification and TSO.ai testing.

In 2020, the United States Department of Defense announced Synopsys as a partner in DARPA&#x27;s Automatic Implementation of Secure Silicon (AISS) research program alongside ARM, Boeing, IBM, and other entities focused on developing automated design tools for secure chips.

In April 2021, following a &quot;Washington Post&quot; report on the use of Synopsys and Cadence Design Systems technology in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s military-civil fusion efforts, U.S. legislators Michael McCaul and Tom Cotton requested that the United States Department of Commerce tighten controls on the sales of semiconductor manufacturing software.

In 2022, Synopsys was reported to be under investigation by the United States Department of Commerce for unlawful technology transfers to sanctioned companies in China such as Huawei&#x27;s HiSilicon and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation.

In July 2022, agents from Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau raided the offices of a Synopsys-backed firm on suspicion of illegally poaching engineers from TSMC.

In October 2022, Synopsys joined Intel&#x27;s US Military Aerospace and Government Alliance (USMAG), under which Synopsys supplies secure EDA tools, IP, and design services for the US DoD and other government branches alongside other chip design companies including Cadence and Siemens EDA.

In August 2023, Synopsys named COO Sassine Ghazi as CEO. Ghazi succeeded Aart de Geus in January 2024, with de Geus transitioning to the role of executive chairman.

In November 2023, Synopsys launched Synopsys.ai Copilot in collaboration with Microsoft, leveraging large language models from OpenAI to accelerate the process of semiconductor chip design.
In January 2024, Synopsys announced its intention to acquire engineering software company Ansys for $35billion, in a move that would expand Synopsys&#x27; prominence in simulation software and systems design for chip designers, automobiles, airplanes. The companies have had a research and development partnership since 2017.

In September 2024, Synopsys announced it would sell its optical systems division to Keysight Technologies to address regulatory concerns related to its proposed acquisition of Ansys.

In October 2024, the private equity firms Clearlake Capital and Francisco Partners completed the acquisition of the Synopsys Software Integrity Group (SIG) to reestablish Black Duck Software as an independent standalone application security company; the transaction, first announced in May 2024, was valued at up to $2.1 billion, including $475 million in cash.

=== Mergers and acquisitions ===
Synopsys has made some silicon and design verification acquisitions.

==== CoWare ====
CoWare development was initiated by the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre in Belgium as an internal project in 1992; it spun off as an independent company, supplying platform-driven electronic system-level (ESL) design software and services, four years later. CoWare was acquired by Synopsys in February 2010.

==== Code Dx ====

Code Dx was an American software technology company active from 2015 to 2021. The company&#x27;s self-titled flagship product is a vulnerability management system that combines and correlates the results generated by a wide variety of static and dynamic testing tools. It was acquired by Synopsys in 2021.

==== Avanti Corporation ====

Avanti Corporation (styled as &quot;Avant!&quot;) was founded when several former Cadence Design Systems employees bought the startup ArcSys, which was previously merged with Integrated Silicon Solutions (ISS), gaining Avanti its design rule checking and layout versus schematic tool Hercules (including 3D silicon structure modeling). Avanti then bought Compass Design Automation, which had fully integrated IC design flow and ASIC libraries, especially its place and route tool, which Avanti reworked to create Saturn and Apollo II. Avanti also bought TMA (Technology Modeling Associates) which brought its pioneering TCAD and Proteus optical proximity correction tools. The acquisition of Avanti was Synopsys&#x27; most significant and controversial acquisition. At the time, Avanti was the No. 4 company in the EDA industry, and was struggling with a major lawsuit from Cadence for software theft. Avanti was merged into Synopsys on June 6, 2002, during the litigation. Synopsys paid Cadence about $265 million to end that litigation. Soon after the settlement, the California Supreme Court upheld the lower court&#x27;s earlier decision. Synopsys then paid $26.1 million to Silvaco to settle two of Silvaco&#x27;s three lawsuits against Meta-Software, earlier purchased by Avanti, and its president. The lawsuits were filed in 1995 and inherited by Avanti.

==== Magma Design Automation ====
Synopsys agreed to buy its competitor Magma Design Automation for about $500 million in an all-cash deal in November 2011.

The two companies previously faced drawn-out, back-and-forth patent disputes, which began in 2004. These disputes arose when Synopsys claimed one of Magma&#x27;s co-founders, Lukas van Ginneken, developed technology for Magma products that was based on work he conducted while employed at Synopsys. While van Ginneken later acknowledged the claim, Magma and Synopsys continued disputing each other&#x27;s patents. The litigations were eventually settled in 2007, with Magma paying Synopsys $12.5 million, and the companies agreeing to cross-license the disputed patents to each other.

==== Ciranova ====
Ciranova was an EDA company which focused on analog design automation. The company authored the Python-based PyCell software now central to IPL Alliance iPDK parameterized cells (used by many foundries such as TSMC), and also developed an automatic analog layout tools called Helix. Ciranova was acquired by Synopsys in 2012.

==== Novas Software ====
Novas Software was a company founded in 1996 to address debugging of chip designs. Novas was purchased by Taiwan-based EDA company SpringSoft in May 2008. SpringSoft and Novas were acquired by Synopsys in 2012.

==== Numerical Technologies ====
Numerical Technologies, Inc. was a San Jose-based electronic design automation public (NASDAQ: NMTC) company. The company was primarily known for its intellectual property, software tools and services covering phase-shifting mask technology. On March 3, 2003, it was acquired by Synopsys for $250 million.

==== SpringSoft ====
SpringSoft is a software company that developed VLSI design and debugging software. The company was founded with a grant from the Taiwanese National Science Council in February 1996.

In 1997, SpringSoft established Novas Software in Silicon Valley to market Springsoft&#x27;s VLSI Debugging software. SpringSoft created a custom layout tool called Laker and a US-based company called Silicon Canvas. In May 2008, SpringSoft purchased Novas Software Silicon Canvas and combined them to form the wholly owned subsidiary SpringSoft USA. SpringSoft employed over 400 people with office locations across the world.

Synopsys announced its acquisition of SpringSoft in 2012.

==== Synplicity ====

Synplicity Inc. was a supplier of software for the design of programmable logic devices (FPGAs, PLDs, and CPLDs) used for communications, military/aerospace, consumer, semiconductor, computer and other electronic systems. Synplicity&#x27;s tools provided logic synthesis, physical synthesis, and verification functions for FPGA, FPGA-based ASIC prototyping, and DSP designers. Synplicity was listed on Nasdaq until it was acquired by Synopsys for $227 million in a transaction finalized on May 15, 2008.

==== ARC International ====
ARC International PLC was the designer of ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processors, which were widely used in SoC devices for IoT, storage, digital home, mobile, and automotive applications. Virage Logic, which acquired ARC International in 2009, was sold to Synopsys in 2010.

==== Coverity ====
In February 2014, Synopsys agreed to acquire static code analysis vendor Coverity for $375million. Synopsys relied on Coverity&#x27;s products for around ten years prior to the acquisition, helping improve software security by finding and fixing defects in software code before its release.

Coverity&#x27;s open-source Coverity Scan tool was hacked and used for cryptocurrency mining in February 2018. Synopsys took down the service for four weeks and confirmed the incident did not affect any of its corporate network and found no evidence of data abuse of its open-source users.

====Codenomicon====
In 2015 Synopsys acquired the Finnish developer of security software Codenomicon. Codenomicon had itself previously acquired the Finnish software company Clarified Networks in 2011.

==== Cigital ====
Synopsys announced the acquisition of Cigital along with its 2015 spinoff Codiscope in November 2016. The suite of its software security products became part of Synopsys&#x27; software integrity group.

==== QuantumWise ====
In 2017 Synopsys acquired the atomic-scale modeling software company QuantumWise (former Atomistix), which provides tools for quantum-based and classical simulations in the field of material science.

==== Black Duck Software ====

Black Duck Software was a privately held company focused on automating the process of identifying and creating an inventory of open source code used in software applications, as well as detecting known security vulnerabilities and license compliance issues. It ran the Open Hub website. Black Duck Software was acquired by Synopsys in December 2017 for $565 million and integrated into the Software Integrity Group (SIG) until it was spun out in October 2024.

==== WhiteHat Security ====

In April 2022, Synopsys announced the acquisition of WhiteHat Security for $330 million. WhiteHat Security was founded in 2001 and provides application security as well as insights for DevOps teams.

==== PikeTec ====

In 2023, Synopsys completed the acquisition of PikeTec, a provider of verification and testing tools for automotive software.

==== Intrinsic ID ====
In March 2024, it was announced Synopsys had acquired the Internet of things digital authentication company Intrinsic ID for an undisclosed amount.

==== Ansys ====
In January 2025, Synopsys announced that the European Commission had approved its proposed $35 Billion acquisition of Ansys in Phase 1, marking significant progress in obtaining regulatory clearances for the merger. The company also reported that the UK Competition and Markets Authority had provisionally accepted remedies for Phase 1 approval, and the waiting period under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act had expired. While actively working with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on proposed remedies review, Synopsys noted that China&#x27;s State Administration for Market Regulation had officially accepted their merger filing. The acquisition aimed to address growing customer demands for integrated Electronic Design Automation and Simulation and Analysis software solutions, with Synopsys maintaining its expectation to close the transaction in the first half of 2025.

<text>Productivity is the efficiency of production of goods or services expressed by some measure. Measurements of productivity are often expressed as a ratio of an aggregate output to a single input or an aggregate input used in a production process, i.e. output per unit of input, typically over a specific period of time. The most common example is the (aggregate) labour productivity measure, one example of which is GDP per worker. There are many different definitions of productivity (including those that are not defined as ratios of output to input) and the choice among them depends on the purpose of the productivity measurement and data availability. The key source of difference between various productivity measures is also usually related (directly or indirectly) to how the outputs and the inputs are aggregated to obtain such a ratio-type measure of productivity.

Productivity is a crucial factor in the production performance of firms and nations. Increasing national productivity can raise living standards because increase in income per capita improves people&#x27;s ability to purchase goods and services, enjoy leisure, improve housing, and education and contribute to social and environmental programs. Productivity growth can also help businesses to be more profitable.

==Partial productivity==
Productivity measures that use one class of inputs or factors, but not multiple factors, are called partial productivities. In practice, measurement in production means measures of partial productivity. Interpreted correctly, these components are indicative of productivity development, and approximate the efficiency with which inputs are used in an economy to produce goods and services. However, productivity is only measured partially – or approximately. In a way, the measurements are defective because they do not measure everything, but it is possible to interpret correctly the results of partial productivity and to benefit from them in practical situations. At the company level, typical partial productivity measures are such things as worker hours, materials or energy used per unit of production.

Before the widespread use of computer networks, partial productivity was tracked in tabular form and with hand-drawn graphs. Tabulating machines for data processing began being widely used in the 1920s and 1930s and remained in use until mainframe computers became widespread in the late 1960s through the 1970s. By the late 1970s inexpensive computers allowed industrial operations to perform process control and track productivity. Today data collection is largely computerized and almost any variable can be viewed graphically in real time or retrieved for selected time periods.

===Labour productivity===
In macroeconomics, a common partial productivity measure is labour productivity. Labour productivity is a revealing indicator of several economic indicators as it offers a dynamic measure of economic growth, competitiveness, and living standards within an economy. It is the measure of labour productivity (and all that this measure takes into account) which helps explain the principal economic foundations that are necessary for both economic growth and social development. In general labour productivity is equal to the ratio between a measure of output volume (gross domestic product or gross value added) and a measure of input use (the total number of hours worked or total employment).

:formula_1

The output measure is typically net output, more specifically the value added by the process under consideration, i.e. the value of outputs minus the value of intermediate inputs. This is done in order to avoid double-counting when an output of one firm is used as an input by another in the same measurement. In macroeconomics the most well-known and used measure of value-added is the gross domestic product or GDP. Increases in it are widely used as a measure of the economic growth of nations and industries. GDP is the income available for paying capital costs, labor compensation, taxes and profits. Some economists instead use gross value added (GVA); there is normally a strong correlation between GDP and GVA.

The measure of input use reflects the time, effort and skills of the workforce. The denominator of the ratio of labour productivity, the input measure is the most important factor that influences the measure of labour productivity. Labour input is measured either by the total number of hours worked of all persons employed or total employment (head count). There are both advantages and disadvantages associated with the different input measures that are used in the calculation of labour productivity. It is generally accepted that the total number of hours worked is the most appropriate measure of labour input because a simple headcount of employed persons can hide changes in average hours worked and has difficulties accounting for variations in work such as a part-time contract, paid leave, overtime, or shifts in normal hours. However, the quality of hours-worked estimates is not always clear. In particular, statistical establishment and household surveys are difficult to use because of their varying quality of hours-worked estimates and their varying degree of international comparability.

GDP per capita is a rough measure of average living standards or economic well-being and is one of the core indicators of economic performance. GDP is, for this purpose, only a very rough measure. Maximizing GDP, in principle, also allows maximizing capital usage. For this reason, GDP is systematically biased in favour of capital intensive production at the expense of knowledge and labour-intensive production. The use of capital in the GDP-measure is considered to be as valuable as the production&#x27;s ability to pay taxes, profits and labor compensation. The bias of the GDP is actually the difference between the GDP and the producer income.

Another labour productivity measure, output per worker, is often seen as a proper measure of labour productivity, as here: &quot;Productivity isn&#x27;t everything, but in the long run it is almost everything. A country&#x27;s ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker.&quot; This measure (output per worker) is, however, more problematic than the GDP or even invalid because this measure allows maximizing all supplied inputs, i.e. materials, services, energy and capital at the expense of producer income.

==Multi-factor productivity==
When multiple inputs are considered, the measure is called multi-factor productivity or MFP. Multi-factor productivity is typically estimated using growth accounting. If the inputs specifically are labor and capital, and the outputs are value added intermediate outputs, the measure is called total factor productivity (TFP]. TFP measures the residual growth that cannot be explained by the rate of change in the services of labour and capital. MFP replaced the term TFP used in the earlier literature, and both terms continue in use (usually interchangeably).

TFP is often interpreted as a rough average measure of productivity, more specifically the contribution to economic growth made by factors such as technical and organisational innovation. The most famous description is that of Robert Solow&#x27;s (1957): &quot;I am using the phrase &#x27;technical change&#x27; as a shorthand expression for any kind of shift in the production function. Thus slowdowns, speed ups, improvements in the education of the labor force and all sorts of things will appear as &#x27;technical change&#x27; .&quot; The original MFP model involves several assumptions: that there is a stable functional relation between inputs and output at the economy-wide level of aggregation, that this function has neoclassical smoothness and curvature properties, that inputs are paid the value of their marginal product, that the function exhibits constant returns to scale, and that technical change has the Hicks’n neutral form. In practice, TFP is &quot;a measure of our ignorance&quot;, as put it, precisely because it is a residual. This ignorance covers many components, some wanted (like the effects of technical and organizational innovation), others unwanted (measurement error, omitted variables, aggregation bias, model misspecification) Hence the relationship between TFP and productivity remains unclear.

== Total productivity ==

When all outputs and inputs are included in the productivity measure it is called total productivity. A valid measurement of total productivity necessitates considering all production inputs. If we omit an input in productivity (or income accounting) this means that the omitted input can be used unlimitedly in production without any impact on accounting results. Because total productivity includes all production inputs, it is used as an integrated variable when we want to explain income formation of the production process.

Davis has considered the phenomenon of productivity, measurement of productivity, distribution of productivity gains, and how to measure such gains. He refers to an article suggesting that the measurement of productivity shall be developed so that it &quot;will indicate increases or decreases in the productivity of the company and also the distribution of the ’fruits of production’ among all parties at interest&quot;. According to Davis, the price system is a mechanism through which productivity gains are distributed, and besides the business enterprise, receiving parties may consist of its customers, staff and the suppliers of production inputs.

In the main article is presented the role of total productivity as a variable when explaining how income formation of production is always a balance between income generation and income distribution. The income change created by production function is always distributed to the stakeholders as economic values within the review period.

==Benefits of productivity growth==

Productivity growth is a crucial source of growth in living standards. Productivity growth means more value is added in production and this means more income is available to be distributed.

At a firm or industry level, the benefits of productivity growth can be distributed in a number of different ways:
* to the workforce through better wages and conditions;
* to shareholders and superannuation funds through increased profits and dividend distributions;
* to customers through lower prices;
* to the environment through more stringent environmental protection; and
* to governments through increases in tax payments (which can be used to fund social and environmental programs).

Productivity growth is important to the firm because it means that it can meet its (perhaps growing) obligations to workers, shareholders, and governments (taxes and regulation), and still remain competitive or even improve its competitiveness in the market place. Adding more inputs will not increase the income earned per unit of input (unless there are increasing returns to scale). In fact, it is likely to mean lower average wages and lower rates of profit. But, when there is productivity growth, even the existing commitment of resources generates more output and income. Income generated per unit of input increases. Additional resources are also attracted into production and can be profitably employed.
==Drivers of productivity growth==

In the most immediate sense, productivity is determined by the available technology or know-how for converting resources into outputs, and the way in which resources are organized to produce goods and services. Historically, productivity has improved through evolution as processes with poor productivity performance are abandoned and newer forms are exploited. Process improvements may include organizational structures (e.g. core functions and supplier relationships), management systems, work arrangements, manufacturing techniques, and changing market structure. A famous example is the assembly line and the process of mass production that appeared in the decade following commercial introduction of the automobile.

Mass production dramatically reduced the labor in producing parts for and assembling the automobile, but after its widespread adoption productivity gains in automobile production were much lower. A similar pattern was observed with electrification, which saw the highest productivity gains in the early decades after introduction. Many other industries show similar patterns. The pattern was again followed by the computer, information and communications industries in the late 1990s when much of the national productivity gains occurred in these industries.

There is a general understanding of the main determinants or drivers of productivity growth. Certain factors are critical for determining productivity growth. The Office for National Statistics (UK) identifies five drivers that interact to underlie long-term productivity performance: investment, innovation, skills, enterprise and competition.
* &quot;Investment&quot; is in physical capital — machinery, equipment and buildings. The more capital workers have at their disposal, generally the better they are able to do their jobs, producing more and better quality output.
* &quot;Innovation&quot; is the successful exploitation of new ideas. New ideas can take the form of new technologies, new products or new corporate structures and ways of working. Speeding up the diffusion of innovations can boost productivity.
* &quot;Skills&quot; are defined as the quantity and quality of labour of different types available in an economy. Skills complement physical capital, and are needed to take advantage of investment in new technologies and organisational structures.
* &quot;Enterprise&quot; is defined as the seizing of new business opportunities by both start-ups and existing firms. New enterprises compete with existing firms by new ideas and technologies increasing competition. Entrepreneurs are able to combine factors of production and new technologies forcing existing firms to adapt or exit the market.
* &quot;Competition&quot; improves productivity by creating incentives to innovate and ensures that resources are allocated to the most efficient firms. It also forces existing firms to organise work more effectively through imitations of organisational structures and technology.

Research and development (R&amp;D) tends to increase productivity growth, with public R&amp;D showing larger spillovers and smaller firms experiencing larger productivity gains from public R&amp;D.

== Individual and team productivity ==
Technology has enabled massive personal productivity gains—computers, spreadsheets, email, and other advances have made it possible for a knowledge worker to seemingly produce more in a day than was previously possible in a year. Environmental factors such as sleep and leisure play a significant role in work productivity and received wage.
Drivers of productivity growth for creative and knowledge workers include improved or intensified exchange with peers or co-workers, as more productive peers have a stimulating effect on one&#x27;s own productivity. Productivity is influenced by effective supervision and job satisfaction. An effective or knowledgeable supervisor (for example a supervisor who uses the Management by objectives method) has an easier time motivating their employees to produce more in quantity and quality. An employee who has an effective supervisor, motivating them to be more productive is likely to experience a new level of job satisfaction thereby becoming a driver of productivity itself. There is also considerable evidence to support improved productivity through operant conditioning reinforcement, successful gamification engagement, and research-based recommendations on principles and implementation guidelines for using monetary rewards effectively.

=== Detrimental impact of bullying, incivility, toxicity and psychopathy ===
Workplace bullying results in a loss of productivity, as measured by self-rated job performance. Over time, targets of bullying will spend more time protecting themselves against harassment by bullies and less time fulfilling their duties. Workplace incivility has also been associated with diminished productivity in terms of quality and quantity of work.

A toxic workplace is a workplace that is marked by significant drama and infighting, where personal battles often harm productivity. While employees are distracted by this, they cannot devote time and attention to the achievement of business goals. When toxic employees leave the workplace, it can improve the culture overall because the remaining staff become more engaged and productive. The presence of a workplace psychopath may have a serious detrimental impact on productivity in an organisation.

In companies where the traditional hierarchy has been removed in favor of an egalitarian, team-based setup, the employees are often happier, and individual productivity is improved (as they themselves are better placed to increase the efficiency of the workfloor). Companies that have these hierarchies removed and have their employees work more in teams are called liberated companies or &quot;Freedom Inc.&#x27;s&quot;. The Kaizen system of bottom-up, continuous improvement was first practiced by Japanese manufacturers after World War II, most notably as part of The Toyota Way.

== Business productivity ==
Productivity is one of the main concerns of business management and engineering. Many companies have formal programs for continuously improving productivity, such as a production assurance program. Whether they have a formal program or not, companies are constantly looking for ways to improve quality, reduce downtime and inputs of labor, materials, energy and purchased services. Often simple changes to operating methods or processes increase productivity, but the biggest gains are normally from adopting new technologies, which may require capital expenditures for new equipment, computers or software. Modern productivity science owes much to formal investigations that are associated with scientific management. Although from an individual management perspective, employees may be doing their jobs well and with high levels of individual productivity, from an organizational perspective their productivity may in fact be zero or effectively negative if they are dedicated to redundant or value destroying activities. In office buildings and service-centred companies, productivity is largely influenced and affected by operational byproducts—meetings. The past few years have seen a positive uptick in the number of software solutions focused on improving office productivity. In truth, proper planning and procedures are more likely to help than anything else.

==Productivity paradox==
Overall productivity growth was relatively slow from the 1970s through the early 1990s, and again from the 2000s to 2020s. Although several possible causes for the slowdown have been proposed there is no consensus. The matter is subject to a continuing debate that has grown beyond questioning whether just computers can significantly increase productivity to whether the potential to increase productivity is becoming exhausted.

==National productivity==
In order to measure the productivity of a nation or an industry, it is necessary to operationalize the same concept of productivity as in a production unit or a company, yet, the object of modelling is substantially wider and the information more aggregate. The calculations of productivity of a nation or an industry are based on the time series of the SNA, System of National Accounts. National accounting is a system based on the recommendations of the UN (SNA 93) to measure the total production and total income of a nation and how they are used.

International or national productivity growth stems from a complex interaction of factors. Some of the most important immediate factors include technological change, organizational change, industry restructuring and resource reallocation, as well as economies of scale and scope. A nation&#x27;s average productivity level can also be affected by the movement of resources from low-productivity to high-productivity industries and activities. Over time, other factors such as research and development and innovative effort, the development of human capital through education, and incentives from stronger competition promote the search for productivity improvements and the ability to achieve them. Ultimately, many policy, institutional and cultural factors determine a nation&#x27;s success in improving productivity.

At the national level, productivity growth raises living standards because more real income improves people&#x27;s ability to purchase goods and services (whether they are necessities or luxuries), enjoy leisure, improve housing and education and contribute to social and environmental programs. Some have suggested that the UK&#x27;s &#x27;productivity puzzle&#x27; is an urgent issue for policy makers and businesses to address in order to sustain growth. Over long periods of time, small differences in rates of productivity growth compound, like interest in a bank account, and can make an enormous difference to a society&#x27;s prosperity. Nothing contributes more to reduction of poverty, to increases in leisure, and to the country&#x27;s ability to finance education, public health, environment and the arts’.

Productivity is considered basic statistical information for many international comparisons and country performance assessments and there is strong interest in comparing them internationally. The OECD publishes an annual Compendium of Productivity Indicators that includes both labor and multi-factor measures of productivity.

<text>Initial-stress derivation is a phonological process in English that moves stress to the first syllable of verbs when they are used as nouns or adjectives. (This is an example of a suprafix.) This process can be found in the case of several dozen verb-noun and verb-adjective pairs and is gradually becoming more standardized in some English dialects, but it is not present in all. The list of affected words differs from area to area, and often depends on whether a word is used metaphorically or not. At least 170 verb-noun or verb-adjective pairs exist. Some examples are:

* &quot;record&quot;.
::as a verb, &quot;&quot;Remember to recórd the show!&quot;.
::as a noun, &quot;I&#x27;ll keep a récord of that request&quot;.&quot;
* &quot;permit&quot;.
::as a verb, &quot;&quot;I won&#x27;t permít that.&quot;
::as a noun, &quot;We already have a pérmit&quot;.&quot;

== Origins ==
Since Early Modern English, polysyllabic nouns in English have had a tendency for the final syllable to be unstressed, but that has not been the case for verbs. Thus, the stress difference between nouns and verbs in English is a general rule and applies not only to otherwise-identical noun-verb pairs. The frequency of such pairs in English is a result of the productivity of conversion of parts of speech.

When &quot;re-&quot; is prefixed to a monosyllabic word, and the word gains currency both as a noun and as a verb, it usually fits into that pattern, but as the following list makes clear, most words fitting the pattern do not match that description.

Many of these have first syllables that evolved from Latin prepositions, but again, that does not account for all of them. See also list of Latin words with English derivatives.

When the stress is moved, the pronunciation of words often changes in other ways as well, especially for vowels, most commonly by the reduction of a vowel sound when it becomes unstressed to a schwa.

== Comments ==

Some two-word phrases follow this pattern. Nouns derived from phrasal verbs like the following are written solid or hyphenated: &quot;hand out&quot;, &quot;drop out&quot;, &quot;hand over&quot;, &quot;crack down&quot;, &quot;follow through&quot;, &quot;come back&quot;.

If the derived noun is widely used (for example &quot;the backup&quot;), its spelling may cause widespread modified spelling of the verb (*&quot;to backup&quot; instead of &quot;to back up&quot;). However, the past tense of such verbs is very rarely written as *&quot;backedup&quot; or *&quot;backupped&quot;, but almost always as &quot;backed up&quot;.

In some cases the spelling changes when the accent moves to another syllable, as in the following verb/noun pairs which show the addition of a &quot;magic e&quot;, which changes the previous vowel from lax to tense:
* &quot;envelop&quot;, &quot;envelope&quot;
* &quot;unite&quot;, &quot;unit&quot;
In British English, &quot;annexe&quot; is the noun from the verb &quot;annex&quot;. The verb &quot;secrete&quot; &quot;conceal&quot; probably derives from the noun &quot;secret&quot; rather than vice versa.

Pronunciations vary geographically. Some words here may belong on this list according to pronunciations prevailing in some regions, but not according to those in others. Some speakers, for example, would consider &quot;display&quot; as one of these words. For some other speakers, however, &quot;address&quot; carries stress on the final syllable in both the noun and the verb. There is a category of English dialects in the United States (namely Southern and African-American dialects) referred to informally by linguists as &quot;P/U&quot; or &quot;police/umbrella&quot; because many nouns are stressed on the first syllable; including &quot;police&quot;, &quot;umbrella&quot;, and other verb-derived nouns. Some dialects of Scottish English have this in &quot;police&quot;.

Some derived nouns are used only in restricted senses; often there is a more generic noun not identical in spelling to the verb. For instance, to &quot;combine&quot; is to put together, whereas a &quot;combine&quot; may be a farm machine or a railway car; the generic noun is &quot;combination&quot;. Perhaps &quot;transpose&quot; is used as a noun only by mathematicians; the &quot;transpose&quot; of a matrix is the result of the process of &quot;transposition&quot; of the matrix; the two-syllable noun and the four-syllable noun differ in meaning in that one is the result and the other is the process. Similar remarks apply to &quot;transform&quot;; the &quot;process&quot; is &quot;transformation&quot;, the &quot;result&quot; of the process is the &quot;transform&quot;, as in Laplace transform, Fourier transform, etc.

In the case of the word &quot;protest&quot;, as a noun it has the stress on the first syllable, but as a verb its meaning depends on stress: with the stress on the second syllable it means to raise a protest; on the first it means to participate in a protest. This appears to result from the derived noun being verbed.

&quot;Entrance&quot; is also a noun when stressed on the first syllable and a verb when on the second, but that is not a true example since the words are unrelated homographs.

<doc id="424905" wikidata="Q833985" url="?curid=424905" title="Pedal tone">
<text>Pedal tones (or pedals) are special low notes in the harmonic series of brass instruments. A pedal tone has the pitch of its harmonic series&#x27; fundamental tone. Its name comes from the foot pedal keyboard pedals of a pipe organ, which are used to play 16&#x27; and 32&#x27; sub-bass notes by pressing the pedals with the player&#x27;s feet. Brasses with a bell do not naturally vibrate at this frequency.

A closed cylinder vibrates at only the odd members of its harmonic series. This set of pitches is too sparse to be musically useful for brass instruments; therefore, the bells and mouthpieces of brasses are crafted to adjust these pitches. The bell significantly raises all pitches in the series, particularly on the low end, while the mouthpiece lowers the higher harmonics, limiting the amount to which higher harmonics are raised by the bell. The resulting compressed set of pitches resembles a new harmonic series that includes the even members. This new series is similar to that of a stopped conical tube, with the exception of the fundamental, which is no longer incorporated in the harmonic series.

The original fundamental resonance is not raised all the way to the new fundamental pitch, and is not used in playing. The new fundamental can be played, however, as a pedal tone. The higher resonances of the new series help the lips vibrate at the fundamental frequency and allow the pitch to sound. The resulting tone relies heavily on overtones for its perception, but in the hands of a skilled player, pedal tones can be controlled and can sound characteristic to the instrument.

On trombone, pedal B1 is frequently seen in commercial scoring but much less often in symphonic music. Notes below B are called for only rarely as they &quot;become increasingly difficult to produce and insecure in quality&quot; with A1 or G1 being the bottom limit for most trombonists.

Pedal tones are called for occasionally in advanced brass repertoire, particularly in that of the trombone and especially the bass trombone. Although not frequently used, pedal tones can often be played on a didgeridoo.

<doc id="424911" wikidata="Q5649201" url="?curid=424911" title="Hannity &amp; Colmes">
<text>Hannity &amp; Colmes was a live television show on Fox News in the United States, hosted by Sean Hannity and Alan Colmes, who respectively presented a conservative and liberal perspective. The series premiered on October 7, 1996, and the final episode aired on January 9, 2009. The show offered Hannity&#x27;s conservative views and Colmes&#x27;s liberal views incorporated into a current news story, or in conjunction with a featured guest.

In addition to politics, the show featured debate about non-political stories, such as the 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal or the death of Anna Nicole Smith, or one-on-one interviews with politicians, commonly with the host who most closely shared the guest&#x27;s political ideology. The show&#x27;s format resembled a former CNN show called &quot;Crossfire&quot;, which similarly had co-hosts on both the left and right.

Fox announced on November 24, 2008 that Alan Colmes would leave the show at the end of the year, but he remained a commentator on Fox News, ran the blog Liberaland, and made occasional appearances on other programs like &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, and Shovio.com&#x27;s &quot;TalkBackTV&quot; up until his death on February 23, 2017. On December 11, 2008, it was announced that Hannity would take over the time slot alone with a new show simply titled &quot;Hannity&quot;, which would have a format closer to his weekend program &quot;Hannity&#x27;s America&quot;. January 9, 2009 was the last airing of &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;, with January 12, 2009 marking the beginning of the new &quot;Hannity&quot; program.

==Guest hosts==
When either Hannity or Colmes were not available, a guest host replaced the missing host while using the same political ideology. Some guest hosts were normal contributors to the show, while others became regular fill-ins.
==Reception==
The show was both praised and criticized by viewers and organizations for the concept and production of the show. Ratings-wise, it was long the second highest-rated program in U.S. cable news behind &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; and averaged 3.3 million viewers nightly for the Nielsen month prior to the 2008 presidential election.

Alan Colmes was touted by Fox as &quot;a hard-hitting liberal&quot;, but stated to &quot;USA Today&quot; that &quot;I&#x27;m quite moderate&quot;. He sometimes took more conservative positions than other prominent liberals, such as supporting Rudy Giuliani for mayor of New York City and agreeing with the use of torture techniques by the government of the United States. He was characterized by several newspapers as being Hannity&#x27;s &quot;sidekick&quot;. Liberal commentator Al Franken lambasted Colmes in his book, &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them&quot;, accusing him of refusing to ask tough questions during debates and neglecting to challenge erroneous claims made by Hannity or his guests. Franken also claimed that Colmes did not speak as much as Hannity during the show. Some critics also questioned whether or not both hosts received equal time to interview guests. Some of Colmes&#x27; liberal critics, notably commentators at Media Matters for America, praised him toward the end of the show&#x27;s run, however. He then began citing their reports in his confrontations with some of his conservative guests on the program.
A study by Media Matters conducted through January and February 2006 stated that the number of conservatives and Republicans brought on as guests outnumbered the number of liberals and Democrats by margins of 72%–28% in January, and 67%–33% in February. Of the solo interviews that were conducted on the show, 80% of the interviews were with conservatives and Republicans.

<text>Whitby Goth Weekend, abbreviated to WGW or nicknamed Whitby, is a twice-yearly music festival for the goth subculture, in Whitby, North Yorkshire, England, organised by Jo Hampshire. The event is an alternative music festival, consisting of two nights of live bands, and three days (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) of alternative trade stalls at the Whitby Leisure Centre, and Whitby Brunswick Centre.

The term &quot;Whitby Goth Weekend&quot; is sometimes used as a generic term to describe events during the week in Whitby as a whole, although the name of the event and its associated logo are registered trademarks of Jo Hampshire of Top Mum Promotions.

==History==
The origins of WGW are in a meeting of around forty of Hampshire&#x27;s pen-pals in 1994. The first meeting was held in the Elsinore public house in Whitby along with the Little Angel, which continues to be a meeting point during the weekend. Hampshire said Whitby was chosen for its Dracula connections, although probably more so because the connection had already fostered a sense of acceptance on the part of locals and businesses rather than any inherent romanticism regarding the location. Until 1997, the festival was held yearly, after which it became twice-yearly in April and October. It has since grown into one of the world&#x27;s most popular goth music events with thousands of attendees from across the UK and beyond.

In the mid-2000s the October weekend on or near Halloween began to attract large numbers of non-goths in Halloween, horror, historical, fantasy and sci-fi costume, which led to an increase in photographers and visitors. The weekend now attracts other alternative subcultures, including Victorian vampires, rockers, punks and steampunks. Some regulars consider it no longer a purely &quot;goth&quot; weekend, and it was acknowledged by Hampshire in the 2014 Whitby Goth Weekend Guide that in order to survive the event would have to diversify into other areas that have influenced goth. In recent years the costumed attendees now outnumber the goth attendees. Whitby Goth Weekend is now not as relevant on the Goth scene as it was 10-15 years ago.

The October 2007 festival was dedicated to the memory of the murdered Goth Sophie Lancaster (who had attended three Whitby Goth Weekends) and a collection of more than £3,000 was raised from various events to fund a memorial bench to her in the town.

Newbies who have not attended the event before are referred to as &quot;Whitby Virgins&quot;. To help introduce them to the event, there was a WGW Virgins Meet Up on the Friday morning at the Spa until about 2014.

In 2016, concerns were raised by locals about disrespect being shown to the graves in St. Mary&#x27;s Churchyard by photographers using them for photographic purposes which has resulted in a petition to have the area closed during the event. The proposal was supported by Whitby Goth Weekend, saying that &quot;behaviour displayed in the churchyard is disrespectful and offensive&quot;. In 2016 The Bram Stoker Film Festival, which also took place in the town, rehashed a proposal to build a film set graveyard which photographers would be charged to use.

In June 2018 there was a breakdown in the relationship between WGW and SIV Live, who operate the Spa. WGW was therefore unable to book the Spa for bands for October 2018. In July a new promoter was found to put bands on at the Spa in October. Subsequently, WGW announced a different set of 2019 dates to those announced by the Spa and the new promoter, with bands at Abbey Wharf, a large pub in Whitby.

==Economy==

The event results in business for the town in general, with attendees spending around 10,000 bed-nights in Whitby and the weekend contributing £1.1 million per annum to the local economy.

==Location and events==
The &quot;weekend&quot; starts during the day on Friday and fringe events are held on Thursday, Sunday and Monday including club nights, markets, and a charity football match between visiting goth team Real Gothic, and local team Stokoemotiv Whitby. During the October/November event there is an independent custom car show, &#x27;Whitby Kustom&#x27; in the grounds of West Cliff School. There are also several &quot;meet ups&quot; aimed at goths with a particular interest, e.g. Gothic Lolita.

The main event was held in the town&#x27;s largest venue, the Whitby Pavilion (known as the Spa) and the Bizarre Bazaar &#x27;Goth Market&#x27; is also held there and at Whitby Leisure Centre and the Brunswick Centre. Access to the Spa in the evening required a ticket and live bands played on both Friday and Saturday from 08:00 until about midnight. The Metropole was often used as an overspill venue for the Spa, with bands due to play the next evening/or playing from the previous evening. In recent years it has been used as a venue for the markets as well as the clubs, Manic Monday and Sexy Sunday. Crafty Cove (formerly RAW Nightclub) holding Shadow Factory and Monster Mash (Dead Skool Disco) and Abbey Wharf are used for official fringe events; other venues including The Resolution, The Rifle Club,The Metropole and the Whitby Rowing Club housing an official SOPHIE Lancaster Fundraising Event, Dark Souls and INVASION on the Sunday are used for unofficial events.

For many years there was a 1980&#x27;s music night held at Laughtons. The night would traditionally end with the song Vagabonds. In 2010 this venue became a Wetherspoons Hotel, but the lineal descendant of the 80&#x27;s night continues to take place on the Sunday night.

<doc id="424921" wikidata="Q1132541" url="?curid=424921" title="Gasket">
<text>A gasket is a mechanical seal which fills the space between two or more mating surfaces, generally to prevent leakage from or into the joined objects while under compression. It is a deformable material that is used to create a static seal and maintain that seal under various operating conditions in a mechanical assembly.

Gaskets allow for &quot;less-than-perfect&quot; mating surfaces on machine parts where they can fill irregularities. Gaskets are commonly produced by cutting from sheet materials. Given the potential cost and safety implications of faulty or leaking gaskets, it is critical that the correct gasket material is selected to fit the needs of the application.

Gaskets for specific applications, such as high pressure steam systems, may contain asbestos. However, due to health hazards associated with asbestos exposure, non-asbestos gasket materials are used when practical.

It is usually desirable that the gasket be made from a material that is to some degree yielding such that it is able to deform and tightly fill the space it is designed for, including any slight irregularities. Some types of gaskets require a sealant be applied directly to the gasket surface to function properly.

Some (piping) gaskets are made entirely of metal and rely on a seating surface to accomplish the seal; the metal&#x27;s own spring characteristics are utilized (up to but not passing σy, the material&#x27;s yield strength). This is typical of some &quot;ring joints&quot; (RTJ) or some other metal gasket systems. These joints are known as R-con and E-con compressive type joints.
 Some gaskets are dispensed and cured in place. These materials are called formed-in-place gaskets.

==Properties==

Gaskets are normally made from a flat material, a sheet such as paper, rubber, silicone, metal, cork, felt, neoprene, nitrile rubber, fiberglass, polytetrafluoroethylene (otherwise known as PTFE or Teflon) or a plastic polymer (such as polychlorotrifluoroethylene).

One of the more desirable properties of an effective gasket in industrial applications for compressed fiber gasket material is the ability to withstand high compressive loads. Most industrial gasket applications involve bolts exerting compression well into the 14 MPa (2000 psi) range or higher. Generally speaking, there are several truisms that allow for better gasket performance. One of the more tried and tested is: &quot;The more compressive load exerted on the gasket, the longer it will last&quot;.

There are several ways to measure a gasket material&#x27;s ability to withstand compressive loading. The &quot;hot compression test&quot; is probably the most accepted of these tests. Most manufacturers of gasket materials will provide or publish the results of these tests.

== Types ==
Gaskets come in many different designs based on industrial usage, budget, chemical contact and physical parameters:

===Sheet gaskets===
Gaskets can be produced by punching the required shape out of a sheet of flat, thin material, resulting in a &quot;sheet gaskets&quot;. Sheet gasket are fast and cheap to produce, and can be produced from a variety of materials, among them fibrous materials and matted graphite (and in the past - compressed asbestos). These gaskets can fill various different chemical requirements based on the inertness of the material used. Non-asbestos gasket sheet is durable, of multiple materials, and thick in nature. Material examples are mineral, carbon or synthetic rubbers such as EPDM, Nitrile, Neoprene, Natural, SBR Insertion - each of which have unique properties suitable for different applications. Applications using sheet gaskets involve acids, corrosive chemicals, steam or mild caustics. Flexibility and good recovery prevent breakage during installation of a sheet gasket.

===Solid material gaskets===
The idea behind solid material is to use metals which cannot be punched out of sheets but are still cheap to produce. These gaskets generally have a much higher level of quality control than sheet gaskets and generally can withstand much higher temperatures and pressures. The key downside is that a solid metal must be greatly compressed in order to become flush with the flange head and prevent leakage. The material choice is more difficult; because metals are primarily used, process contamination and oxidation are risks. An additional downside is that the metal used must be softer than the flange — in order to ensure that the flange does not warp and thereby prevent sealing with future gaskets. Even so, these gaskets have found a niche in industry.

===Spiral-wound gaskets===
Spiral-wound gaskets comprise a mix of metallic and filler material. Generally, the gasket has a metal (normally carbon rich or stainless steel) wound outwards in a circular spiral (other shapes are possible) with the filler material (generally a flexible graphite) wound in the same manner but starting from the opposing side. This results in alternating layers of filler and metal. The filler material in these gaskets acts as the sealing element, with the metal providing structural support.

These gaskets have proven to be reliable in most applications, and allow lower clamping forces than solid gaskets, albeit with a higher cost.

===Constant seating stress gaskets===
The constant seating stress gasket consists of two components; a solid carrier ring of a suitable material, such as stainless steel, and two sealing elements of some compressible material installed within two opposing channels, one channel on either side of the carrier ring. The sealing elements are typically made from a material (expanded graphite, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), vermiculite, etc.) suitable to the process fluid and application.

Constant seating stress gaskets derive their name from the fact that the carrier ring profile takes flange rotation (deflection under bolt preload) into consideration. With all other conventional gaskets, as the flange fasteners are tightened, the flange deflects radially under load, resulting in the greatest gasket compression, and highest gasket stress, at the outer gasket edge.

Since the carrier ring used in constant seating stress gaskets take this deflection into account when creating the carrier ring for a given flange size, pressure class, and material, the carrier ring profile can be adjusted to enable the gasket seating stress to be radially uniform across the entire sealing area. Further, because the sealing elements are fully confined by the flange faces in opposing channels on the carrier ring, any in-service compressive forces acting on the gasket are transmitted through the carrier ring and avoid any further compression of the sealing elements, thus maintaining a &#x27;constant&#x27; gasket seating stress while in-service. Thus, the gasket is immune to common gasket failure modes that include creep relaxation, high system vibration, or system thermal cycles.

The fundamental concept underlying the improved sealability for constant seating stress gaskets are that (i) if the flange sealing surfaces are capable of attaining a seal, (ii) the sealing elements are compatible with the process fluid and application, and (iii) the sufficient gasket seating stress is achieved on installation necessary to affect a seal, then the possibility of the gasket leaking in-service is greatly reduced or eliminated altogether.

===Double-jacketed gaskets===
Double-jacketed gaskets are another combination of filler material and metallic materials. In this application, a tube with ends that resemble a &quot;C&quot; is made of the metal with an additional piece made to fit inside of the &quot;C&quot; making the tube thickest at the meeting points. The filler is pumped between the shell and piece. When in use, the compressed gasket has a larger amount of metal at the two tips where contact is made (due to the shell/piece interaction) and these two places bear the burden of sealing the process. Since all that is needed is a shell and piece, these gaskets can be made from almost any material that can be made into a sheet and a filler can then be inserted.

===Kammprofile gaskets===
Kammprofile gaskets (sometimes spelled &quot;Camprofile&quot; due to their design resembling the profile of a camshaft, which is a rotating component in internal combustion engines.) are used in many older seals since they have both a flexible nature and reliable performance. Kammprofiles work by having a solid corrugated core with a flexible covering layer. This arrangement allows for very high compression and an extremely tight seal along the ridges of the gasket. Since generally the graphite will fail instead of the metal core, Kammprofile can be repaired during later inactivity. Kammprofile has a high capital cost for most applications but this is countered by long life and increased reliability.

===Fishbone Gaskets===
Fishbone Gaskets are direct replacements for Kammprofile and Spiralwound gaskets. They are fully CNC machine manufactured from similar materials but the design of the gaskets has eliminated inherent short comings. Fishbone gaskets do not unwind in storage or in the plant. The rounded edges do not cause flange damage. The added &quot;Stop Step&quot; prevents the Fishbone gaskets from being over compressed/crushed, often caused by hot torque techniques on plant start up. The bones of the gasket remain ductile and adjust to thermal cycling and system pressure spikes, resulting in a durable and reliable flange seal that out performs all other gaskets of this nature significantly.

===Flange gasket===

A flange gasket is a type of gasket made to fit between two sections of pipe that are flared to provide higher surface area.

Flange gaskets come in a variety of sizes and are categorized by their inside diameter and their outside diameter.

There are many standards in gasket for flanges of pipes. The gaskets for flanges can be divided into four major categories:
#Sheet gaskets
#Corrugated metal gaskets
#Ring gaskets
#Spiral wound gaskets

&quot;Sheet gaskets&quot; are simple, they are cut to size either with bolt holes or without holes for standard sizes with various thickness and material suitable to media and temperature pressure of pipeline.

&quot;Ring gaskets&quot; also known as RTJ. They are mostly used in offshore oil- and gas pipelines and are designed to work under extremely high pressure. They are solid rings of metal in different cross sections like oval, round, octagonal etc. Sometimes they come with hole in center for pressure .

&quot;Spiral wound gaskets&quot; are also used in high pressure pipelines and are made with stainless steel outer and inner rings and a center filled with spirally wound stainless steel tape wound together with graphite and PTFE, formed in V shape. Internal pressure acts upon the faces of the V, forcing the gasket to seal against the flange faces. Most spiral wound gasket applications will use two standard gasket thicknesses: 1/8 inch and 3/16 inch. With 1/8 inch thick gaskets, compression to a 0.100 inch thickness is recommended. For 3/16 inches, compress to a 0.13 inch thickness.

=== Soft cut gasket ===
Soft gasket is a term that refers to a gasket that is cut from a soft (flexible) sheet material and can easily conform to surface irregularities even when the bolt load is low. Soft gaskets are used in applications such as heat exchangers, compressors, bonnet valve and pipe flanges.

=== Ring type joint gasket (RTJ gasket) ===
Annular Seal (RTJ Seal) is a high integrity, high temperature, high pressure seal for applications in the oil industry, oilfield drilling, pressure vessel connections, pipes, valves and more.

The movement of the ring packing (RTJ) can be described as an irregular flow in the groove of the deformed sealing flange due to the axial compressive load. Colored seal (RTJ seal) has a small load area, which leads to a large surface pressure between the sealing surface and the groove, the maintenance properties are poor and not suitable for reuse.

==Improvements==
Many gaskets contain minor improvements to increase or infer acceptable operating conditions:
* A common improvement is an inner compression ring. A compression ring allows for higher flange compression while preventing gasket failure. The effects of a compression ring are minimal and generally are just used when the standard design experiences a high rate of failure.
* A common improvement is an outer guiding ring. A guiding ring allows for easier installation and serves as a minor compression inhibitor. In some alkylation uses these can be modified on Double Jacketed gaskets to show when the first seal has failed through an inner lining system coupled with alkylation paint.

== Reasons for failure==

===Uneven distributed pressing force===
Uneven pressure can be caused by a variety of factors. First is the human factor: asymmetric application of the bolt preload, this can cause uneven pressure. Theoretically when the flanges are pressed, the sealing surfaces are absolutely parallel, in practice however, the centerline of a pipeline cannot be absolutely concentric, and tightening the bolts on the flange moment makes the flange a discontinuity. With asymmetric connections, the seal surfaces will be more or less deformed and the pressure reduced, the running load, prone to leakage. Third, the density of bolt arrangement has an obvious impact on the pressure distribution, the closer the bolts, the more uniform the pressure.

===Stress relaxation and torque loss===
Tighten the bolts on the flange. Due to vibration, temperature changes, and other factors such as spiral wound gasket stress relaxation, the bolt tension will gradually decrease, resulting in loss of torque, causing a leak. In general longer bolts and smaller diameters of bolt are better at preventing the loss of torque. A long thin bolt is an effective way to prevent torque loss. Heating for a certain period of time to stretch the bolt, and then maintaining a given torque, is very effective in preventing the loss of torque. When the gasket is thinner and smaller there will be a greater loss of torque. In addition, prevent strong vibration of the machine and the pipe itself, and isolate them from adjacent equipment vibration. Impacts on the sealing surface are not meaningless. Not impacting the tightened bolts can prevent the loss of torque.

===Surface not smooth===
It is important to make the sealing finish properly otherwise it will cause leakage. A surface that is too smooth can allow your gasket material to blow out under pressure. A surface that is not machined flat can provide leak paths. A good rule of thumb is a machined surface to 32RMS. This insures the surface is flat, but with enough surface finish to bite into the gasket under compression.

=== Metal Reinforced Gasket ===
With metal core coated gaskets, both sides of the core are covered with a flexible, malleable sealant. There are reinforced metal seals in the pressure class up to 300. A strong metal core prevents pressure seals and a soft core ensures exceptional sealing.

<doc id="424924" wikidata="Q2610210" url="?curid=424924" title="A440 (pitch standard)">
<text>A440 (also known as Stuttgart pitch) is the musical pitch corresponding to an audio frequency of 440 Hz, which serves as a tuning standard for the musical note of A above middle C, or A4 in scientific pitch notation. It is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO 16. While other frequencies have been (and occasionally still are) used to tune the first A above middle C, A440 is now commonly used as a reference frequency to calibrate acoustic equipment and to tune pianos, violins, and other musical instruments.

==History and use==
Before standardization to 440 Hz, many countries and organizations followed the French standard since the 1860s of 435 Hz, which had also been the Austrian government&#x27;s 1885 recommendation. Johann Heinrich Scheibler recommended A440 as a standard in 1834 after inventing the &quot;tonometer&quot; to measure pitch, and it was approved by the Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians at a meeting in Stuttgart the same year.

The American music industry reached an informal standard of 440 Hz in 1926, and some began using it in instrument manufacturing.

In 1936, the American Standards Association recommended that the A above middle C be tuned to 440 Hz. 

In 1937 Sir James Swinburne, an electrical engineer and avid amateur musician, delivered a lecture to the Royal Musical Association on &quot;The Ideal Scale,&quot; discussing the possibility of tuning a scale to pure ratios and adjusting these ratios to maintain consonance across different keys. The following year, Swinburne represented the Musical Association at a preliminary conference to determine the British stance on concert pitch. British piano tuners had adopted A439 as the standard in 1899, but Swinburne pointed out that 439 was a prime number, whereas 440 could be more easily factored and electronically synthesized. In May of 1939, delegates from France, Germany, Holland, Italy, and England convened at Broadcasting House in London, the headquarters of the BBC, to address the issue of concert pitch. Representatives from Switzerland and the United States participated via mail. The other European delegates concurred with Swinburne&#x27;s position and agreed to a standard of A440.

This standard was taken up by the International Organization for Standardization in 1955 as Recommendation R 16, before being formalised in 1975 as ISO 16.

The A440 standard is not universally adhered to. Early-music ensembles continue to use older, lower pitch levels. Leonard Bernstein often tuned the New York Philharmonic to A442, leading to complaints from the piano tuners’ union, although he claimed both the New York and Boston orchestras had used this higher pitch for years.

==Modern practices==

A440 is widely used as concert pitch in the United Kingdom and the United States. In continental Europe the frequency of A4 commonly varies between 440 Hz and 444 Hz.
In the period instrument movement, a consensus has arisen around a modern &quot;baroque pitch&quot; of 415 Hz (with 440 Hz corresponding to A), a &#x27;baroque&#x27; pitch for some special church music (in particular, some German church music, e.g. the pre-Leipzig period cantatas of Bach) known as &quot;Chorton pitch&quot; at 466 Hz (with 440 Hz corresponding to A), and &quot;classical pitch&quot; at 427–430 Hz.

A440 is often used as a tuning reference in just intonation regardless of the fundamental note or key.

The US time and frequency station WWV broadcasts a 440 Hz signal at two minutes past every hour, with WWVH broadcasting the same tone at the first minute past every hour. This was added in 1936 to aid orchestras in tuning their instruments.

<text>Dimitri Uznadze (; December 2, 1886, Imereti – October 9, 1950, Tbilisi) was a Georgian psychologist and professor of psychology, co-founder of the Tbilisi State University (TSU) and of the Georgian Academy of Sciences (GAS).

== Life and works ==

Dimitri Uznadze was born in 1886 to a peasant family, in the small village of Sakara in the province of Kutaisi (Western Georgia). 
He was expelled from Kutaisi high school for taking part in the 1905 revolution.
That year he went to Switzerland and then to Germany, where he entered the philosophy faculty of Leipzig University, graduating in 1909. In 1910 he received a PhD degree at the University of Wittenberg (Halle, Germany) for his work &quot;Vladimir Solovev: His Epistemology and Metaphysics&quot; (1909). He graduated from Kharkiv University in 1913.
Returning home in 1909, from then until 1917 he taught history at the Kutaisi Georgian Gymnasium, and was headmaster of the Sinatle girls&#x27; school from 1915 to 1917.

After the October Revolution, Uznadze helped establish the Tbilisi State University (TSU). From 1918 to 1950, Uznadze was Professor and Head of the Department of Psychology of TSU.

In 1935 he received Dr.Sci. degree in Psychology.
In 1941 he co-founded the Georgian Academy of Sciences (GAS). From 1941 to 1950 he was first Director of the Institute of Psychology of the GAS (now the Uznadze Institute of Psychology).
In 1946 Uznadze received title of Meritorious Science Worker of Georgia.

Main fields of scientific activity of Dimitri Uznadze were: philosophy and psychology. He was also author of Theory of Attitude and Set and founder of Georgian school of the psychology of pedagogics. Uznadze&#x27;s main scientific works are: &quot;Wladimir Solowjow: seine Erkenntnistheorie und Metaphysik&quot; (a monograph, in German, Halle, 1910); &quot;Henri Bergson&quot; (a monograph, in Russian, Tbilisi, 1923); &quot;Untersuchungen zur Psychologie der Einstellung&quot; (&quot;Acta Psychologica&quot;, Vol.IV, No.3, 1939, in German); &quot;The Psychology of Set&quot; (a monograph, in English, New York City, 1966); &quot;Psychological Investigations&quot; (In Russian, English summary, Moscow, 1966).

Uznadze died on October 9, 1950, in Tbilisi. He is buried in the garden of the Tbilisi State University.

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of locomotives,  represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels, six powered and coupled driving wheels and four trailing wheels. In France where the type was first used, it is known as the Baltic while it became known as the Hudson in most of North America.
==Overview==
===Tender locomotives===
The 4-6-4 tender locomotive was first introduced in 1911 and throughout the 1920s to 1940s, the wheel arrangement was widely used in North America and to a lesser extent in the rest of the world. The type combined the basic design principles of the 4-6-2 type with an improved boiler and larger firebox that necessitated additional support at the rear of the locomotive. In general, the available tractive effort differed little from that of the 4-6-2, but the steam-raising ability was increased, giving more power at speed. The 4-6-4 was best suited to high-speed running across flat terrain. Since the type had fewer driving wheels than carrying wheels, a smaller percentage of the locomotive&#x27;s weight contributed to traction, compared to other types. Like the 4-6-2, it was well suited for high speed passenger trains, but not for starting heavy freight trains and slogging on long sustained grades, where more pairs of driving wheels are better.

The first 4-6-4 tender locomotive in the world was a four-cylinder compound locomotive, designed by Gaston du Bousquet for the Chemins de fer du Nord in France in 1911. Since it was designed for the Paris-Saint Petersburg express, it was named the Baltic after the Baltic Sea, which was a logical extension of the naming convention that started with the 4-4-2 and 4-6-2.

The first 4-6-4 in the United States of America, J-1a #5200 of the New York Central Railroad, was built in 1927 to the railroad&#x27;s design by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO). There, the type was named the Hudson after the Hudson River. They are also designed to pull 16-18 passenger cars in passenger service.

The world speed record for steam locomotives was held by a 4-6-4 at least twice. In 1934, the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s class F6 no. 6402 reached and, in 1936, the German class 05.002 reached . That record was broken by the British 4-6-2 no. 4468 &quot;Mallard&quot; on 3 July 1938, when it reached , still the world speed record for steam traction.

===Tank locomotives===
The 4-6-4T was also a fairly common wheel arrangement for passenger tank locomotives. As such, it was essentially the tank locomotive equivalent of a tender locomotive, with water tanks and a coal bunker supported by four trailing wheels instead of in a tender. In New Zealand, some 4-6-4T locomotives (the Wab class) were tank versions of 4-6-2 locomotives (of the Ab class).

The first known 4-6-4 tank locomotive was rebuilt from a Natal Government Railways (NGR) K&amp;S Class 4-6-0T which was modified in 1896 to enable it to run equally well in either direction on the Natal South Coast line, where no turning facilities were available at the time. This sole locomotive later became the Class C2 on the South African Railways (SAR). The first known locomotive class to be designed with a 4-6-4T wheel arrangement, the NGR&#x27;s Class F tank locomotive, was based on this modified locomotive and built by Neilson, Reid &amp; Company in 1902. These became the Class E on the SAR in 1912.

One streamlined 4-6-4T was built for the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1935.

==Use==
===Australia===
;Tender locomotives

Seventy R class 4-6-4 tender locomotives, the only class of this configuration in Australia and built by North British Locomotive Company, were introduced by the Victorian Railways in 1951 for mainline express passenger operations. However, the introduction in 1952 of the B class diesel-electric locomotives saw the R class almost immediately being relegated to secondary passenger and freight use, with many being staged at depots around the state. A number were preserved and some of these continued to operate on special excursion trains.
With the privatisation of regional passenger operations in Victoria in the mid-1990s, two R class locomotives were brought back into normal revenue service by the West Coast Railway, for regularly scheduled mainline passenger trains between Melbourne and Warrnambool. The locomotives underwent a number of modifications to allow for reliable high speed operation, including dual Lempor exhausts, oil firing and the addition of a diesel control stand for multiple unit operation. The use of these R class locomotives ceased after the demise of the private operator in 2004.

;Tank locomotives
The tank locomotive configuration was a popular type with the Western Australian Government Railways. The D class was introduced for suburban passenger service in 1912. Its successors, both also of the 4-6-4T wheel arrangement, were the Dm class of 1945 that was rebuilt from older E class 4-6-2 tender locomotives, and the Dd class of 1946.

The New South Wales Government Railways 30 Class 4-6-4T locomotives were used on Sydney and Newcastle suburban passenger train workings from 1903 until the end of steam operations in the 1970s. No. 3046 is preserved at the Dorrigo Steam Railway &amp; Museum. No. 3013 is stored, dismantled at the Canberra Railway Museum. 3085 is awaiting restoration at Goulburn Roundhouse. 3112 operated tour trains for a number of years but is currently out of service in Canberra. 3137 saw regular use in the 1970s and 1980s as part of the NSW Rail Museum operating fleet, but is out of service and now on static display at Thirlmere.

===Canada===
;Tender locomotives

The second-largest user of the type in North America was the Canadian Pacific with 65 H1a to H1e class locomotives, numbered 2800 to 2864 and built by Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) between 1929 and 1940. They were highly successful and improved service and journey times on the CPR&#x27;s transcontinental routes. The third and later batches of CPR Hudsons, H1c to H1e numbers 2820 to 2864, were dubbed &quot;Royal Hudsons&quot; and were semi-streamlined. Royal permission was given for these locomotives to bear the royal crown and arms after locomotive No. 2850 hauled King George VI across Canada in 1939.

Five CPR Hudsons survived. H1b class no. 2816 &quot;Empress&quot; is the sole remaining unstreamlined CPR Hudson. It was repatriated from static display at Steamtown in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to the CPR in 1998 and was restored and converted to oil-burning to haul excursions for CPR. The other four remaining H1 class locomotives are all &quot;Royal Hudsons&quot;. As of 2010, the four &quot;Royal Hudsons&quot;were on display in museums, No. 2839 in California, No. 2850 in Quebec, No. 2858 in Ontario, and No. 2860 – the first oil-burning &quot;Royal Hudson&quot; of the class – in British Columbia. By 2008, the CPR Hudsons were the only operational Hudsons in North America. (Also see North American production list)

;Tank locomotives
The Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) had six K2 class locomotives, built in September 1914 by MLW and acquired for suburban service. Numbered 1540 to 1545 on the GTR, they were reclassified as X-10-a and renumbered 45 to 50 after being absorbed by the Canadian National (CN) in 1923. Three of them are preserved, numbers GT 1541 (CN 46) in Vallee-Jonction, QC, (CN 47) at the Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and GT 1544 (CN 49) at the Canadian Railway Museum in Delson, Quebec. (Also see North American production list)

===Finland===

The Finnish State Railways Class Pr2, nicknamed &quot;Henschel&quot;, was a gauge passenger tank locomotive class, ordered from Henschel &amp; Son by the Estonian State Railways in the spring of 1939 and completed in 1941. The outbreak of the Second World War prevented their delivery to Estonia, but a few of these engines did operate in Latvia in 1942. They became superfluous when the Germans began converting the Baltic tracks to , and the four locomotives were sold to Finland. They were classified Pr2 and numbered 1800 to 1803 upon their arrival in Finland in December 1942.

The Class Pr2 tanks were quite advanced locomotives and were based on the Henschel-built DRG Class 62 tank engine design of 1928 for the Deutsche Reichsbahn. After their initial teething problems were solved, they proved to be fast runners and an ideal addition to the motive power stable. They were originally built as oil-burners and reverted to this type of fuel between 1947 and 1954, when oil prices were low. With its coupled wheels, it was very fast and one of them achieved during a test run. No. 1803, the last Class Pr2 in service, was withdrawn in May 1960. Only no. 1800 has been preserved.

===France===
The four-cylinder compound locomotive designed by Gaston du Bousquet for the French Chemins de fer du Nord, of which two (3.1101 and 3.1102) were built at the company&#x27;s workshops in 1911, was the first tender locomotive in the world with this wheel arrangement. Named the &quot;Baltic&quot; since it was intended for service on the Paris-Saint Petersburg express, its most remarkable feature was the &quot;en echelon&quot; arrangement of the two low-pressure inside cylinders in order to accommodate the very large bore. One of them was built with a water-tube firebox. Although they were not multiplied, they were the forerunners of the highly successful 4-6-2 Nord Pacifics and Super-Pacifics. One survives in the Cité du Train at Mulhouse in eastern France, cut up in sectioned form to display its interior during the World Exhibition in Paris in 1937. Its tender was not preserved.
France also produced some of the last Baltic locomotives. In 1938, Marc de Caso, the last Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Nord, originated the construction of eight Baltic locomotives, all delivered to the newly established SNCF. Of these eight, three were 232.R class three-cylinder simple expansion (simplex) locomotives with rotary cam poppet valve gear, while four were 232.S class four-cylinder compound locomotives, initially also with poppet valve gear that was later replaced by Walschaerts valve gear driving oscillating cams. Built for comparative purposes, it was found that the compounds outperformed the simples.

The eighth of the class, the final French Baltic type, was completed in 1949 as the 232.U.1 class. This was another four-cylinder compound with Walschaerts valve gear, but with very large and light piston valves, that proved capable of more than . This locomotive is also preserved at Mulhouse. (Also see Netherlands)

===Germany===
;Tender locomotives

Three tender locomotives were built for the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG) by August Borsig in 1935. Designated Class 05, they were designed for high speed running. They were three-cylinder locomotives with giant driving wheels and powerful clasp brakes on all wheels.

The first two locomotives were conventional locomotives, but the third was built as a cab forward and burned pulverised coal. All three were built streamlined, in shrouds that covered the locomotives almost to the railhead. On 11 May 1936, the 05.002 set a world speed record of that was bettered by the British 4-6-2 &quot;Mallard&quot; two years later, on 3 July 1938. The 05.003 was converted to conventional boiler-forward running in 1944.

All three survived the Second World War and were rebuilt as conventional non-streamlined locomotives in 1950, with new boilers. They worked in this form until 1957, when electric locomotives took over on the high-speed routes. The first locomotive, 05.001, was restored to its original streamlined configuration in 1961, for display in the Nuremberg Transport Museum.

;Tank locomotives
A number of German locomotive classes were built, the best known being the Prussian T 18 class of 1912. Altogether 534 of them were built by the Stettiner Maschinenbau AG Vulcan and Henschel &amp; Son between 1912 and 1927. Of these, 458 went to the Prussian state railways and subsequently the Deutsche Reichsbahn, where they became the DRG Class 78.

===India===
There were two classes of tender locomotives in India, both early in the history of the wheel arrangement and also of unusually narrow gauge. The nine G class locomotives of the gauge Barsi Light Railway in western India were built by Nasmyth, Wilson &amp; Company in 1928 and 1930 and by WG Bagnall in 1939. The four ND class locomotives of the gauge Scindia State Railway in Gwalior were built in 1928 by Kerr, Stuart &amp; Company. 

===Indonesia===

Java Staatsspoorwegen as state-owned railways in Dutch East Indies ordered 39 units of 4-6-4T for the need of increasing traffic of express trains, manufactured by Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM), Switzerland, Armstrong Whitworth, UK and Werkspoor, Netherlands and soon classified as SS Class 1100 (SS 1101–1139) which were came in 1919–1920. The class was designed to meet the requirement to haul trains of 400 tons at a speed of on a incline with radius curves and must be able to turn corners with a radius of 120 metres and a speed of 80 kilometres per hour (50 miles per hour). These SS 1100s were initially made to work the express interurban train which connecting Surabaya–Malang and could achieve its speeds at 100 kilometres per hour (62 miles per hour). The SS 1100s were superseded by more fast and reliable SS 1300s in 1921. As an alternative, several SS 1100s were made to work the East Java Express trains, working in tandem with the 2-8-0 SS Class 900 (D50) providing 5 hours travel between Surabaya and Banyuwangi. After Japanese occupation and Indonesian Independence they renumbered to C27 class. Of the 39 built, two are preserved as static exhibits at the Ambarawa Railway Museum and the Transportation Museum of Taman Mini Indonesia Indah.
By 1921, 58 units of new express locomotives were built for the &quot;Java Staatsspoorwegen&quot; from 3 German builders (Henschel &amp; Son, Sächsische Maschinenfabrik and Maschinenfabrik Esslingen) with specifications could haul some series of trains at speeds of 90 kilometres per hour (56 miles per hour) on flat line and 45 kilometres per hour (28 miles per hour) on incline, they were classified as SS Class 1300 (1301-1358). During some tests, the power output jumped to 1,000 horsepower (hp) from its design which only 900 horsepower. SS 1300s could easily driven at speeds of 100 kilometres per hour (62 miles per hour) on flat routes and 55 kilometres per hour (34 miles per hour) on inclines. It was declared the world&#x27;s fastest steam locomotive on gauge when the drivers could spur locomotives up to and used to haul some express trains like &quot;Eendaagsche&quot; and &quot;Java Nacht&quot; on Batavia (Weltevreden)–Surabaya line, &quot;Vlugge Vier&quot; on Batavia (Weltevreden)–Bandung line and &quot;Vlugge Vijf&quot; on Surabaya–Malang line. After Japanese occupation and Indonesian Independence, they renumbered as C28 class. The C28s were one of the most popular in Indonesia especially for the drivers, beside achieving speeds of up to , they were reliable and also easy to maintain. One of the C28 class number 35 was also modified to tender locomotive (4-6-4) on Cepu line which carried out by &quot;Djawatan Kereta Api&quot; (DKA) or The Department of Railway of the Republic of Indonesia for presidential train. This modification was actually part of a plan carried out by SS since 1930s to modified their 4-6-4 tank engines to tender one using tenders from the scrapped Bull Moose Alco 2-8-8-0 SS Class 1200 (DKA DD50) to extend their operational range when hauled the express trains but it was cancelled due to Great Depression and Second World War. But unfortunately, the modified tank-tender locomotive was also scrapped in the end of steam ages in Indonesia.

===Ireland===
The first and longest-lived Baltics in Ireland were two locomotives, built by Nasmyth, Wilson in 1904 for the narrow-gauge County Donegal Railways. Both were later superheated and one lasted until 1967, albeit derelict.

===Japan===
Between 1947 and 1961, the Japanese National Railways built three classes of rather advanced American-style gauge Hudson tender locomotives.

* Between 1947 and 1949, 33 Class C61 locomotives were rebuilt from former Class D51 Mikado freight locomotives. The Class C61 was the first Japanese locomotive with the Hudson wheel arrangement.
* In 1948 and 1949, 49 Class C62 locomotives were built with new 4-6-4 frames and using the boilers of Class D52 Mikado locomotives. These were the largest and fastest steam passenger locomotives to run in Japan.
* Between 1953 and 1961, 47 Class C60 locomotives were rebuilt from surplus Class C59 Pacific locomotives at the Hamamatsu and Kōriyama factories.

The Class C60 and Class C61 were smaller locomotives than the Class C62, which filled the tight Japanese loading gauge. They were equipped with Boxpok driving wheels and used several American-style appliances, even though they had British-style smokebox doors.

===Netherlands===
The Dutch Railways ordered six 4-6-4T passenger locomotives from Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company in 1913. A follow-up order for 34 locomotives was only partly delivered when, due to the downturn in traffic caused by World War I, the Dutch authorities cancelled the remainder of the order. The 40 locomotives as ordered were originally to be numbered 1201 to 1240, but the 26 that were delivered were later renumbered 6001 to 6026.

The 14 undelivered locomotives were sold to the British War Department for use on the Western Front, where air-braked passenger locomotives were in short supply. They were assigned Railway Operating Division (ROD) numbers 1 to 12, 14 and 15 and were used on ambulance and troop trains as well as civilian passenger trains in the British sector.

After the war, they were sold to the Chemins de fer du Nord in France, who numbered them 3.871 to 3.884. In 1938, all 14 passed on to the SNCF, who renumbered them 232.TB.1 to 232.TB.14. Two were withdrawn in 1946, but the rest remained in service until 1950–1951. They were outlived by their Dutch sister locomotives, of which twenty were still in service in 1952. (Also see France)

There were also ten four-cylinder 6100 class locomotives, built in 1929 by Hohenzollern and Werkspoor and based on the 3700 4-6-0 class. The last two were withdrawn in 1958.

===Philippines===

There were two 4-6-4 tank locomotives built by the North British Locomotive Company as an extension of the original 120 class for the Manila Railroad Company built in 1910. Numbered Manila Railroad 127 and 128, the two locomotives were based in Tarlac City yards. No. 128 remained in service with the Manila Railroad by 1946 on the Canlubang branch line, and were scrapped before 1952.

The original Manila Railroad 160 class was also assigned to an order of seven 4-6-4T types also built by NBL in 1914. However, due to World War I hampering the transfer of British equipment to Asia, the 4-6-4s were instead given to South Africa. The 160 class numbering was later given to four 2-6-0+0-6-2 Kitson Meyer locomotives known as the Manila Railroad 160 class.

===South Africa===
No tender locomotives saw service in South Africa, but six 4-6-4T tank locomotive classes were used, all of them on .

In 1896, the Natal Government Railways (NGR) rebuilt one of its Class K&amp;S 4-6-0 tank locomotives to a configuration, as directed by NGR Locomotive Superintendent George William Reid. This was the first known use of this wheel arrangement and was done to enable the locomotive to run equally well in either direction in shuttle service on the Natal South Coast line, where no turning facilities were available. In 1912, when it was assimilated into the South African Railways (SAR), this locomotive was designated Class C2.
Ten tank locomotives, designed by G.W. Reid, were built for the NGR by Neilson, Reid &amp; Company in 1902. It was the first known locomotive in the world to be designed and built as a Baltic type. Known as the Neilson, Reid locomotives until they were designated the NGR&#x27;s Class F, they were larger versions of the rebuilt Class H locomotive of 1896 and many of the main dimensions were identical. It had a plate frame, Stephenson valve gear and used saturated steam. In 1912 they became the Class E on the SAR.
Eight Class F tank locomotives were placed in service on the Central South African Railways (CSAR) in 1904, designed by CSAR Chief Locomotive Superintendent P.A. Hyde and built by Vulcan Foundry. It had a bar frame, Stephenson valve gear and used saturated steam, and was acquired for the suburban services between Springs and Randfontein. The double red lining on their black livery and polished copper-capped chimneys, brass domes and boiler bands earned them the nickname &quot;Chocolate Boxes&quot;. These locomotives retained their Class F classification on the SAR.
In 1905, two rack tank locomotives were built for the CSAR by Vulcan Foundry, for use on the steep rack section between Waterval Onder and Waterval Boven on the line to Mozambique. Designed as two-cylinder locomotives by Hyde, the design was modified by the builders to four cylinders with the inside cylinders driving the rack equipment, but without a compensating increase in boiler capacity. The locomotives were failures on the rack section, their rack equipment was removed within a year of entering service and they were reassigned to shunting duty. In 1912, they were considered obsolete by the SAR and not classified, but they remained in service until 1915.
Seven Class K tank locomotives which had been built for the Manila Railway Company in the Philippine Islands by the North British Locomotive Company in 1914, were sold to the SAR in 1917 since delivering them to the Philippines during the First World War became impossible. They were superheated, had Walschaerts valve gear and were the first locomotives in South Africa to be equipped with exhaust steam injectors, which were of the Davies &amp; Metcalfe pattern. Nicknamed &quot;Manila&quot;, they remained in service until 1938.
Six tank locomotives, designed by SAR Chief Mechanical Engineer D.A. Hendrie and built by Nasmyth, Wilson &amp; Company, were introduced on the SAR in 1915. Designated Class J, they had Walschaerts valve gear and Belpaire fireboxes and used saturated steam. Acquired to cope with increasing traffic on the Natal South Coast, but unable to handle the rapidly increasing loads due to their small proportions, they soon ended up being employed as shunting engines in the Durban harbour, at Mossel Bay and in the Cape Midlands, until they were withdrawn from service by 1957.

===Soviet Union===

Only three prototype Hudson locomotives were built in the former Soviet Union, in 1937 and 1938. They were all streamlined and were the only streamlined series of Soviet steam locomotives, although a later post-war P36 series Northern locomotive was semi-streamlined. All three were scrapped in the 1950s.
* In 1937, two were built by the Kolomna Locomotive Works. These were known as the 2-3-2K locomotives, designed by Lev Lebedyanskii and rated at . Designated the P12 series, they were used to haul the &quot;Red Arrow&quot; passenger train between Moscow and Leningrad. The intention was to build up to ten 2-3-2K locomotives to haul all express passenger trains between Moscow and Leningrad, but these plans were interrupted by the Second World War and not resumed.
* Another one was built in Voroshilovgrad in 1938, known as the 2-3-2V experimental locomotive number 6998. This locomotive was never used on mainline service.

;Tender locomotives

The only tender locomotive in the United Kingdom was the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) no. 10000, built in 1930 as an experimental high-pressure compound locomotive with an experimental high-pressure water-tube boiler. It was the only locomotive of the Class W1 and became known as the &quot;Hush-hush locomotive&quot; on account of the great secrecy under which it was built. Its trailing wheels were arranged uniquely. Instead of being in one four-wheel trailing truck, the first pair was a Cartazzi axle, mounted in a rigid frame but still allowed sideways deflection against a centering force, as typical of the LNER&#x27;s practice on its Pacific locomotives. The second pair was in a two-wheel trailing truck.

The experiment proved much less successful than had been hoped and in 1936 it was rebuilt along the lines of a streamlined LNER Class A4 4-6-2, though it retained its 4-6-4 wheel arrangement. After being rebuilt, the Class W1 was still easily distinguishable from an A4 at a glance, without looking for the extra trailing wheels, by the fact that it was never officially named even though the name &quot;Pegasus&quot; had been proposed. It therefore became known among trainspotters as the &quot;Un-named&quot; or &quot;No-name Streak&quot;.

In 1938 William Stanier considered a 4-6-4 express passenger locomotive design, together with a related 4-8-4 as a large mixed-traffic locomotive, but during WWII the British government forbade the development of express passenger locomotives. The 4-8-4 design did continue though and in 1942 was looked at by Fairburn, the acting CME, as a possible post-war type for fast fitted freights. 

;Tank locomotives
A number of locomotives were built for various British railway companies.

The first standard-gauge examples were Robert Whitelegg&#x27;s design in 1912 for the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&amp;SR). They were only delivered after the LT&amp;SR had been taken over by the Midland Railway, where they were designated the 2100 class.

Between 1914 and 1922, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) built seven L class tank locomotives, known as the &quot;Brighton Baltics&quot;. The first examples suffered from instability problems until they were rebuilt with well-tanks. These high-speed tank locomotives hauled the famous &quot;Brighton Belle&quot; train until the electrification of the Brighton Main Line in 1933, after which they were converted into N15X class tender locomotives. They remained in service until 1957.

The Glasgow and South Western Railway and a number of other railways also had tank locomotive classes of this wheel arrangement.

* The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway examples were very rare in having four cylinders. Known as the &quot;Dreadnought Tanks&quot;, they proved to be too large and too complex for the duties they performed.
* The saturated steam tank locomotives of the Belfast and County Down Railway were highly unsuccessful because of poor valve settings.
* Contrarily, the Furness Railway 115 class (which also used saturated steam but with inside cylinders) were very popular with their crews.

===United States===

Except for the Grand Trunk Railway&#x27;s K2 Class tank locomotives built in the 1910s, all American 4-6-4 locomotives had tenders.

The first Hudson locomotive in North America was built in 1927 for the New York Central Railroad (NYC) by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO), to the railroad&#x27;s design. The locomotive proved to be very successful and was named the Hudson type, after the Hudson River. Thirteen of these locomotives, one J-1e type and twelve J-3a types, were streamlined for use with named passenger trains like the &quot;Empire State Express&quot; and the &quot;20th Century Limited&quot;. Between the NYC and its subsidiaries, the Boston &amp; Albany Railroad (B&amp;A), the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St Louis Railway (CCC&amp;StL or &quot;Big Four&quot;) and the Michigan Central Railroad (MC), they acquired altogether 275 locomotives of several different types, the largest Hudson fleet in North America.

The Milwaukee Road could have produced the first American since its design work was done earlier than that of the NYC, but financial constraints delayed the project and the Milwaukee&#x27;s locomotives only emerged in 1930. The Milwaukee called them Baltic, following the European practice started in France. The initial order of fourteen Class F6 locomotives was followed by eight more Class F6a locomotives in 1931 and, in 1938, the Milwaukee acquired six streamlined Class F7 Hudsons with the shrouds. These took over the Milwaukee&#x27;s crack &quot;Hiawatha&quot; express trains from the Class A Atlantics and were among the fastest steam locomotives of all time. Similar to the Milwaukee F7s, the Chicago &amp; North Western (CNW) Class E-4 were streamlined 4-6-4s with 84 in drivers.

Another early adopter of the 4-6-4 was the Atchison, Topeka, &amp; Santa Fe (Santa Fe) who ordered 10 3450 class 4-6-4 locomotives in 1927 from Baldwin. The 3450 class employed the same boiler as Santa Fe&#x27;s 3400 class Pacifics with a larger grate and slightly smaller 73 in drivers. Santa Fe designated their new 4-6-4 a &quot;Heavy Pacific&quot;. In 1937, Santa Fe substantially modified their 3450 class, reducing tubing, increasing the firebox area, and increasing drivers to 79in. The same year, they ordered 6 more Heavy Pacific 4-6-4s (class 3460) from Baldwin including one streamlined locomotive (the Blue Goose, 3460). Like the F7 and E4, the 3460 class employed drivers. In December 1937, locomotive #3461 set a world record for the longest single run by a steam locomotive by completing the 2,227 miles (3,584 km) from Los Angeles, California to Chicago without maintenance other than five re-fuelling stops en route, hauling Train #8, the Fast Mail Express.
In 1937, the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad (Burlington Route) needed backup locomotives for their streamlined diesel-hauled &quot;Zephyr&quot; passenger trains. Their solution was to streamline their Baldwin-built No. 3002 in their main Iowa shops. The locomotive was renumbered 4000 and given the name &quot;Æolus&quot;, after the mythical keeper of the winds. A second streamlined was built for this purpose and numbered 4001.

There were also some once-off and experimental locomotives. A number were rebuilt from Pacific locomotives, or in some cases from other designs.
*The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) built four as experimental locomotives between 1933 and 1936, using Colonel Emerson&#x27;s water-tube fireboxes, but eventually turned to diesel-electric traction instead.
*In 1937, the Illinois Central Railroad (IC) rebuilt a 2-8-4 Berkshire into its only Hudson, the Illinois Central No. 1, which was not a success and was not repeated. The railroad had also rebuilt seven 4-6-0s gained with acquisition of the Chesapeake, Ohio and Southwestern Railroad into 4-6-4Ts for easier bi-directional operation. All were scrapped with their line&#x27;s electrification finishing in 1928.
*The Wabash Railroad rebuilt its seven Class P1 Hudsons from their unsuccessful K-4 and K5 Class 2-8-2 Mikado locomotives.
*From 1937 to 1941 the Frisco Railroad rebuilt their 10 1060 class 1917-built 4-6-2s. While large and powerful they had initially had firebox problems, but the rebuild as Hudsons resolved this in addition to further boosting their strength. They received blue streamlining on their running boards and some lasted into the last year of steam on the Frisco in 1952.
*In 1946 the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway rebuilt their five F-19 class pacifics into hudsons, with four of them gaining streamlining. These were in addition the as-built 4-6-4s purchased and to be purchased by the road. They were intended to serve alongside the new streamlined M-1 class steam turbine locomotives on the new &quot;Chessie&quot; service. However, the train&#x27;s launch was cancelled due to declining post-war passenger numbers, and dieselization meant both the rebuilds and newbuilds were all retired by the mid-1950s. One of the rebuilds, 490, has been preserved, still with its streamlining, at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Museum.

====North American production list====

Altogether 21 railroads in North America owned s. Many were similar in concept to the NYC Hudsons, with driving wheels, but most were a little larger than the NYC locomotives, such as the F6 and F6a classes of the Milwaukee Road, the class of the Canadian National, the Canadian Pacific locomotives, the class of the Burlington Route, the class of the New Haven and the 1151 class of the Lackawanna. The heaviest were the C&amp;O&#x27;s class at 443,000 lbs, There were also the lightweights, which include the class of the Nickel Plate Road, the class D of the Maine Central and the class of the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México (N de M). On these, the extra axle was used to reduce the axle load in comparison to a Pacific locomotive.

Because the design was really only optimally suited to express passenger trains, which were dieselised early, the Hudsons were early candidates for withdrawal and scrapping. None of the NYC locomotives survived and neither did any of the Milwaukee locomotives. Five Canadian Pacific Hudsons survive, including four Royal Hudsons and the un-streamlined Canadian Pacific 2816. Five of the Burlington Route locomotives survive, including the &quot;Aeolus&quot;. Other surviving 4-6-4 locomotives are two each of the Santa Fe and Canadian National, and single examples from the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, N de M and Nickel Plate Road. The Pennsylvania Railroad also owned the P5 class of electric locomotives, also with a wheel arrangement.

== Model railroading ==
The Lionel Corporation used the 4-6-4 arrangement in several of its locomotives.

<text>Patrick Süskind (; born 26 March 1949) is a German writer and screenwriter, known best for his novel &quot;Perfume: The Story of a Murderer&quot;, first published in 1985.

==Early life==
Süskind was born in Ambach, Bavaria. His father was writer and journalist, Wilhelm Emanuel Süskind, who worked for the newspaper &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; and was the co-author of the well-known publication &quot;Aus dem Wörterbuch des Unmenschen&quot; (&quot;From the Dictionary of an Inhuman&quot;), a critical collection of essays concerning the language of the Nazi era. His mother, Annemarie Süskind, née Schmitt, was a sports teacher; his older brother (1944–2009) was a journalist and speechwriter.

After his qualification testing for university and his mandatory community service, Süskind studied medieval and modern history at the University of Munich and in Aix-en-Provence from 1968 to 1974, but never graduated. Funded by his parents, he relocated to Paris, where he wrote &quot;mainly short, unpublished fiction and longer screenplays which were not made into films&quot;.

==Career==
In 1981, he had his first major success with the play &quot;Der Kontrabaß&quot; (&quot;The Double Bass&quot;), which was conceived originally as a radio play. During the theatrical season of 1984–85, the play was performed more than 500 times. The only role is that of a tragi-comical orchestra musician. During the 1980s, working with the director Helmut Dietl, Süskind was also successful as a screenwriter for the television productions &quot;Monaco Franze&quot; (1983) and &quot;Kir Royal&quot; (1987), among others. In 1996 he won the Screenplay Prize of the German Department for Culture for his screenplay of &quot;&quot;, directed by Dietl. He rejected other awards, such as the FAZ-Literaturpreis, the Toucan Prize, and the Gutenberg Prize.

His best-known work is the novel &quot;Perfume: The Story of a Murderer&quot; (1985). &quot;Perfume&quot; was on the bestselling list of the German weekly news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; for nine years, has been translated into 49 languages and has worldwide sales of more than 20 million copies. In the early 2000s, it was included in the BBC&#x27;s poll-generated list of the 100 best-loved novels. Also, it was adapted into directed by Tom Tykwer. Süskind has also published a novella, &quot;The Pigeon&quot; (1988), &quot;The Story of Mr Sommer&quot; (1991, illustrated by French cartoonist Sempé), &quot;Three Stories and a Reflection&quot; (1996), and an essay, &quot;On Love and Death&quot; (2006).

== Personal life ==
Süskind lives a reclusive, private lifestyle and divides his time between Munich and France. He rarely grants interviews and few photographs of him have been published.

His spouse is the German publisher Tanja Graf de], with whom he has a son.

<text>, or , was a province of Japan in the part of Honshū that is today Wakayama Prefecture, as well as the southern part of Mie Prefecture. Kii bordered Ise, Izumi, Kawachi, Shima, and Yamato Provinces. The Kii Peninsula takes its name from this province.

During the Edo period, the Kii branch of the Tokugawa clan had its castle at Wakayama. Its former ichinomiya shrine was Hinokuma Shrine.

The Japanese bookshop chain Kinokuniya derives its name from the province.

<doc id="424947" wikidata="Q735011" url="?curid=424947" title="Freak">
<text>A freak is a person who is physically deformed or transformed due to an extraordinary medical condition or body modification. This definition was first attested with this meaning in the 1880s as a shorter form of the phrase &quot;&quot;, itself a broader term meaning &quot; or of nature&quot;, attributed at least as far back as 1847. The term&#x27;s original neutral connotation became entirely negative during the 20th century; therefore, &quot;freak&quot; with its literal meaning of &quot;abnormally developed individual&quot; is viewed purely as a pejorative today. However, the term is also recently used playfully to refer to an enthusiast or obsessive person.

==Usage==
&quot;Freak&quot; saw usage as jargon by promoters and performers of freak shows, though its use in this sense has decreased along with the popularity of freak shows. One well-known example of this word was in reference to Joseph Merrick, the &quot;Elephant Man.&quot; As a jargon, side-show freaks were classified into two groups: natural freaks and self-made freaks. A natural freak would usually have been born with a genetic abnormality, while a self-made freak was a person who was altered artificially (with methods such as surgical implants).

The term has a variety of much more recent meanings. An example is something strikingly unusual about one&#x27;s appearance or behavior. This usage originated from &quot;freak scene&quot; during the 1960s and 1970s, most famously promoted by the album &quot;Freak Out!&quot; made by the rock band &quot;The Mothers of Invention&quot;.

A recent usage of &quot;freak&quot; is as a synonym for enthusiast, such as a &quot;health freak&quot;; or referring to obsessive behavior, such as &quot;control freak&quot;.

==In science==
&quot;Freak&quot; is used in science to describe plants and animals with a genetic mutation.

<doc id="424948" wikidata="Q994776" url="?curid=424948" title="Brutalist architecture">
<text>Brutalist architecture is an architectural style that emerged during the 1950s in the United Kingdom, among the reconstruction projects of the post-war era. Brutalist buildings are characterised by minimalist constructions that showcase the bare building materials and structural elements over decorative design. The style commonly makes use of exposed, unpainted concrete or brick, angular geometric shapes and a predominantly monochrome colour palette; other materials, such as steel, timber, and glass, are also featured.

Descending from the modernist movement, brutalism is said to be a reaction against the nostalgia of architecture in the 1940s. Derived from the Swedish phrase &quot;nybrutalism,&quot; the term &quot;new brutalism&quot; was first used by British architects Alison and Peter Smithson for their pioneering approach to design. The style was further popularised in a 1955 essay by architectural critic Reyner Banham, who also associated the movement with the French phrases &quot;béton brut&quot; (&quot;raw concrete&quot;) and &quot;art brut&quot; (&quot;raw art&quot;). The style, as developed by architects such as the Smithsons, Hungarian-born Ernő Goldfinger, and the British firm Chamberlin, Powell &amp; Bon, was partly foreshadowed by the modernist work of other architects such as French-Swiss Le Corbusier, Estonian-American Louis Kahn, German-American Mies van der Rohe, and Finnish Alvar Aalto.

In the United Kingdom, brutalism was featured in the design of utilitarian, low-cost social housing influenced by socialist principles and soon spread to other regions around the world, while being echoed by similar styles like in Eastern Europe. Brutalist designs became most commonly used in the design of institutional buildings, such as provincial legislatures, public works projects, universities, libraries, courts, and city halls. The popularity of the movement began to decline in the late 1970s, with some associating the style with urban decay and totalitarianism. Brutalism&#x27;s popularity in socialist and communist nations owed to traditional styles being associated with the bourgeoisie, whereas concrete emphasized equality.

Brutalism has been polarising historically; specific buildings, as well as the movement as a whole, have drawn a range of criticism (often being described as &quot;cold&quot;). There are often public-led campaigns to demolish brutalist buildings. Some people are favourable to the style and in the United Kingdom some buildings have been preserved.

== History ==
The term &quot;nybrutalism&quot; (new brutalism) was coined by the Swedish architect Hans Asplund to describe Villa Göth, a modern brick home in Uppsala, designed in January 1950 by his contemporaries Bengt Edman and Lennart Holm. Showcasing the &#x27;as found&#x27; design approach that would later be at the core of brutalism, the house displays visible I-beams over windows, exposed brick inside and out, and poured concrete in several rooms where the tongue-and-groove pattern of the boards used to build the forms can be seen. The term was picked up in the summer of 1950 by a group of visiting English architects, including Michael Ventris, Oliver Cox, and Graeme Shankland, where it apparently &quot;spread like wildfire, and [was] subsequently adopted by a certain faction of young British architects&quot;.

The first published usage of the phrase &quot;new brutalism&quot; occurred in 1953, when Alison Smithson used it to describe a plan for their unbuilt Soho house which appeared in the November issue of &quot;Architectural Design&quot;. She further stated: &quot;It is our intention in this building to have the structure exposed entirely, without interior finishes wherever practicable.&quot; The Smithsons&#x27; Hunstanton School completed in 1954 in Norfolk, and the Sugden House completed in 1955 in Watford, represent the earliest examples of new brutalism in the United Kingdom. Hunstanton school, likely inspired by Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s 1946 Alumni Memorial Hall at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, United States, is notable as the first completed building in the world to carry the title of &quot;new brutalist&quot; by its architects. At the time, it was described as &quot;the most truly modern building in England&quot;.

The term gained increasingly wider recognition when British architectural historian Reyner Banham used it to identify both an ethic and aesthetic style, in his 1955 essay &quot;The New Brutalism&quot;. In the essay, Banham described Hunstanton and the Soho house as the &quot;reference by which The New Brutalism in architecture may be defined.&quot; Reyner Banham also associated the term &quot;new brutalism&quot; with art brut and &quot;béton brut&quot;, meaning &quot;raw concrete&quot; in French, for the first time. The best-known &quot;béton brut&quot; architecture is the proto-brutalist work of the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, in particular his 1952 &quot;Unité d&#x27;habitation&quot; in Marseille, France; the 1951–1961 Chandigarh Capitol Complex in India; and the 1955 church of Notre Dame du Haut in Ronchamp, France.

Banham further expanded his thoughts in the 1966 book, &quot;The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic?&quot;, to characterise a somewhat recently established cluster of architectural approaches, particularly in Europe. In the book, Banham says that Le Corbusier&#x27;s concrete work was a source of inspiration and helped popularise the movement, suggesting &quot;if there is one single verbal formula that has made the concept of Brutalism admissible in most of the world&#x27;s Western languages, it is that Le Corbusier himself described that concrete work as &#x27;béton-brut&#x27;&quot;. He further states that &quot;the words &#x27;The New Brutalism&#x27; were already circulating, and had acquired some depth of meaning through things said and done, over and above the widely recognised connection with &quot;béton brut&quot;. The phrase still &#x27;belonged&#x27; to the Smithsons, however, and it was their activities above all others that were giving distinctive qualities to the concept of Brutalism.&quot;

== Motif ==

New brutalism is not only an architectural style; it is also a philosophical approach to architectural design, a striving to create simple, honest, and functional buildings that accommodate their purpose, inhabitants, and location. Stylistically, brutalism is a strict, modernistic design language that has been said to be a reaction to the architecture of the 1940s, much of which was characterised by a retrospective nostalgia.
Peter Smithson believed that the core of brutalism was a reverence for materials, expressed honestly, stating &quot;Brutalism is not concerned with the material as such but rather the quality of material&quot;, and &quot;the seeing of materials for what they were: the woodness of the wood; the sandiness of sand.&quot; Architect John Voelcker explained that the &quot;new brutalism&quot; in architecture &quot;cannot be understood through stylistic analysis, although some day a comprehensible style might emerge&quot;, supporting the Smithsons&#x27; description of the movement as &quot;an ethic, not an aesthetic&quot;. Reyner Banham felt the phrase &quot;the new brutalism&quot; existed as both an attitude toward design as well as a descriptive label for the architecture itself and that it &quot;eludes precise description, while remaining a living force&quot;. He attempted to codify the movement in systematic language, insisting that a brutalist structure must satisfy the following terms, &quot;1, Formal legibility of plan; 2, clear exhibition of structure, and 3, valuation of materials for their inherent qualities &#x27;as found&#x27;.&quot; Also important was the aesthetic &quot;image&quot;, or &quot;coherence of the building as a visual entity&quot;.

Brutalist buildings are usually constructed with reoccurring modular elements representing specific functional zones, distinctly articulated and grouped together into a unified whole. There is often an emphasis on graphic expressions in the external elevations and in the whole-site architectural plan in regard to the main functions and people-flows of the buildings. Buildings may use materials such as concrete, brick, glass, steel, timber, rough-hewn stone, and gabions among others. However, due to its low cost, raw concrete is often used and left to reveal the basic nature of its construction with rough surfaces featuring wood &quot;shuttering&quot; produced when the forms were cast in situ. Examples are frequently massive in character (even when not large) and challenge traditional notions of what a building should look like with focus given to interior spaces as much as exterior.

A common theme in brutalist designs is the exposure of the building&#x27;s inner-workings—ranging from their structure and services to their human use—in the exterior of the building. In the Boston City Hall, designed in 1962, the strikingly different and projected portions of the building indicate the special nature of the rooms behind those walls, such as the mayor&#x27;s office or the city council chambers. From another perspective, the design of the Hunstanton School included placing the facility&#x27;s water tank, normally a hidden service feature, in a prominent, visible tower. Rather than being hidden in the walls, Hunstanton&#x27;s water and electric utilities were delivered via readily visible pipes and conduits.

Brutalism as an architectural philosophy was often associated with a socialist utopian ideology, which tended to be supported by its designers, especially by Alison and Peter Smithson, near the height of the style. Indeed, their work sought to emphasize functionality and to connect architecture with what they viewed as the realities of modern life. Among their early contributions were &quot;streets in the sky&quot; in which traffic and pedestrian circulation were rigorously separated, another theme popular in the 1960s. This style had a strong position in the architecture of European communist countries from the mid-1960s to the late 1980s (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, USSR, Yugoslavia). In Czechoslovakia, Brutalism was presented as an attempt to create a &quot;national&quot; but also &quot;modern socialist&quot; architectural style. Such prefabricated socialist era buildings are called panelaky.

A sub-genre of brutalism is &quot;brick brutalism&quot; or &quot;brickalism&quot;, where the dominant structural material is brick rather than concrete. Examples range from the Smithson&#x27;s house in Soho (1952) to Colin St John Wilson&#x27;s British Library (1982–98).

== Designers ==

In the United Kingdom, architects associated with the brutalist style include Ernő Goldfinger, wife-and-husband pairing Alison and Peter Smithson, some of the work of Sir Basil Spence, the London County Council/Greater London Council Architects Department, Owen Luder, John Bancroft, and, arguably perhaps, Sir Denys Lasdun, Sir Leslie Martin, Sir James Stirling and James Gowan with their early works. Some well-known examples of brutalist-influenced architecture in the British capital include the Barbican Centre (Chamberlin, Powell and Bon) and the National Theatre (Denys Lasdun).

In the United States, Paul Rudolph and Ralph Rapson were both noted brutalists. Evans Woollen III, a pacesetter among architects in the Midwest, is credited for introducing the Brutalist and Modernist architecture styles to Indianapolis, Indiana. Walter Netsch is known for his brutalist academic buildings. Marcel Breuer was known for his &quot;soft&quot; approach to the style, often using curves rather than corners. In Atlanta, Georgia, the architectural style was introduced to Buckhead&#x27;s affluent Peachtree Road with the Ted Levy-designed Plaza Towers and Park Place on Peachtree condominiums. Many of the stations of the Washington Metro, particularly older stations, were constructed in the brutalist style. Architectural historian William Jordy says that although Louis Kahn was &quot;[o]pposed to what he regarded as the muscular posturing of most Brutalism&quot;, some of his work &quot;was surely informed by some of the same ideas that came to momentary focus in the brutalist position.&quot;
In Australia, examples of the brutalist style are Robin Gibson&#x27;s Queensland Art Gallery, Ken Woolley&#x27;s Fisher Library at the University of Sydney (his State Office Block is another), the High Court of Australia and Warringah Civic Centre by Christopher Kringas, the MUSE building (also referred to as C7A MUSE) which was the original Library at Macquarie University before the new library replaced it, and WTC Wharf (World Trade Centre in Melbourne). John Andrews&#x27;s government and institutional structures in Australia also exhibit the style. One of the first brutalist buildings in Melbourne was the Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre in Malvern, designed by Daryl Jackson and Kevin Borland in 1967. It has been nominated for heritage protection.

Canada possesses numerous examples of brutalist architecture. In the years leading to the 100th anniversary of the Confederation in 1967, the Federal Government financed the construction of many public buildings. Major brutalist examples, not all built as part of the Canadian Centennial, include the Grand Théâtre de Québec, the Édifice Marie-Guyart (formerly Complex-G), Hôtel Le Concorde, and much of the Laval University campus in Quebec City; Habitat 67, Place Bonaventure, the Maison de Radio-Canada, and several metro stations on the Montreal Metro&#x27;s Green Line; the Confederation Centre of the Arts in Charlottetown; the National Arts Centre in Ottawa; the Hotel Dieu Hospital in Kingston; the Ontario Science Centre, Robarts Library, Rochdale College in Toronto; Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre and Canadian Grain Commission building in Winnipeg; and the church of the Westminster Abbey in British Columbia. Prominent Vancouver-based architect, Arthur Erickson was responsible for several notable brutalist developments including Simon Fraser University&#x27;s main campus building, the MacMillan Bloedel Building, Vancouver&#x27;s Evergreen Building, the Museum of Anthropology and Vancouver Law Courts.

In Serbia, Božidar Janković was a representative of the so-called &quot;Belgrade School of residence&quot;, identifiable by its functionalist relations on the basis of the flat and elaborated in detail the architecture. Known example, Western City Gate also known as the Genex Tower is a 36-storey skyscraper in Belgrade, Serbia, which was designed in 1977 by Mihajlo Mitrović. It is formed by two towers connected with a two-storey bridge and revolving restaurant at the top. It is tall (with restaurant ) and is the second-tallest high-rise in Belgrade after Ušće Tower. The building was designed in the brutalist style with some elements of structuralism and constructivism. It is considered a prime representative of the brutalist architecture in Serbia and one of the best of its style built in the 1960s and the 1970s in the world. The treatment of the form and details is slightly associating the building with postmodernism and is today one of the rare surviving representatives of this style&#x27;s early period in Serbia. The artistic expression of the gate marked an entire era in Serbian architecture.

In Vietnam, brutalist architecture is particularly popular among old public buildings and has been associated with the &quot;bao cấp&quot; era (lit: subsidizing), the period during which the country followed Soviet-type economic planning. Many Soviet architects, most notably Garol Isakovich, were sent to Vietnam during that time to help train new architects and played an influential role in shaping the country&#x27;s architectural styles for decades. Isakovich himself also designed some of the most notable brutalist buildings in Vietnam, including the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Palace of Culture and Labour (1985). In his later years, Isakovich, who was awarded the Hero of Labor by the Vietnamese government in 1976, is said to have deviated from the brutalist style and adopted Vietnamese traditional styles in his design, which has been referred to by some Vietnamese architects as &quot;Chủ nghĩa hiện đại địa phương&quot; (lit: local modernism) and &quot;hậu hiện đại&quot; (postmodernism). In the former South Vietnam, notable buildings that are said to carry brutalist elements include the Independence Palace (1966) designed by Ngô Viết Thụ, the first Asian architect to become an Honorary Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. However, whether South Vietnamese architecture prior to 1975 was brutalism or not remains a matter of dispute, with some architects argued it was actually modernism. In recent years, public sentiments in Vietnam towards brutalist architecture has shifted negatively, but the style is said to have made a comeback recently.

== On university campuses ==

Early examples of brutalist architecture in British universities include the &#x27;beehives&#x27; at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, (Michael Powers of the Architects&#x27; Co-Partnership; 1958–60) and the extension to the department of architecture at the University of Cambridge in 1959 under the influence of Leslie Martin, the head of the department, and designed by Colin St John Wilson and Alex Hardy, with participation by students at the university. This inspired further brutalist buildings in Cambridge, including the Grade II listed University Centre and the Grade II listed Churchill College. The Grade II* listed History Faculty Building (1964–67) is described in its listing as &quot;a distinctive example of a new approach to education buildings, from a period when the universities were at the forefront of architectural patronage&quot;. It was the second building in architect James Stirling&#x27;s &quot;Red Trilogy&quot;, which started with the University of Leicester Engineering Building (with James Gowan; 1959–63), designed to reflect the vernacular architecture of Leicester&#x27;s factories and sometimes regarded as the first post modern building in Britain, 
and concluded with the Florey Building at Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford (1966–71).
The building of new universities in the UK in the 1960s led to opportunities for brutalist architects. The first to be built was the University of Sussex, designed by Basil Spence, with the Grade I listed Falmer House (1960–62) as its centerpiece. The building has been described as a &quot;meeting of Arts and Crafts with modernism&quot;, with features such as hand-made bricks that contrast with the pre-fabricated construction of other 1960s campuses, and colonnades of bare, board-marked concrete arches on brick piers inspired by the Colosseum. It is also considered one of the &quot;key Brutalist buildings&quot; by the Royal Institute of British Architects. It has, in a reversal of the usual situation for brutalist architecture, received popular acclaim while being less liked by professional critics and is sometimes described as picturesque rather than brutalist.
Denys Lasdun&#x27;s work at the University of East Anglia, including six linked halls of residence in Norfolk Terrace and four linked halls of residence in Suffolk Terrace (commonly referred to as the &#x27;ziggurats&#x27;) and the library and &#x27;teaching wall&#x27; between them, is considered one of the finest examples of a 1960s brutalist university campus. The ziggurats were closed in 2023 as part of the reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete crisis, with no date set for their refurbishment . Another notable example is the Central Hall of the University of York (1966–68) with its surrounding colleges (1963–65) designed by Stirrat Johnson-Marshall and Andrew Derbyshire of Robert Matthew, Johnson-Marshall &amp; Partners. The reinforced concrete of the Central Hall gives a contrast to the colleges, which were the first university buildings built using the CLASP prefabricated system originally developed for school buildings. The same architectural practice would go on to build the universities of Bath, Stirling and Ulster. The Grade II listed lecture block at Brunel University (John Heywood of Richard Sheppard, Robson and Partners; 1965–68) was used as a location in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. The central campus complex of the University of Essex (1964) was designed by Kenneth Capon of the Architects&#x27; Co-Partnership, with complementary concrete extensions by Patel Taylor matching the brutalist aesthetic in 2015.
A notable pairing of brutalist campus buildings is found at Durham University, with Ove Arup&#x27;s Grade I-listed Kingsgate Bridge (1963), one of only six post-1961 buildings to have been listed as Grade I by 2017, and the Grade II-listed Dunelm House (Richard Raines of the Architects&#x27; Co-Partnership with Michael Powers as the partner-in-charge; 1964–66), described in its listing as &quot;the foremost students&#x27; union building of the post-war era in England&quot; but only saved from demolition in 2021 following a five-year campaign by the Twentieth Century Society. Dunelm House was designed to reflect the vernacular architecture of the city in the way its multiple levels cascade down the river bank, breaking up the bulk of the building. This lead Pevsner to describe it as &quot;Brutal by tradition but not brutal to the landscape&quot; and to it being praised as a brutalist building that works well in its setting even by opponents of the style.

One of the earliest brutalist buildings in the US was Paul Rudolph&#x27;s 1963 Art and Architecture Building at Yale University where, as department chair, he was both client and architect, giving him a unique freedom to explore new directions. Rudolph&#x27;s 1964 design for the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth is a rare example of an entire campus designed in the brutalist style, and was considered by him to be &quot;the most complete realisation of his experiments with urbanism and monumentality&quot;. Walter Netsch similarly designed the entire University of Illinois-Chicago Circle Campus (now the East Campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago) under a single, unified brutalist design. Netsch also designed the brutalist Joseph Regenstein Library for the University of Chicago and the Northwestern University Library. Crafton Hills College in California was designed by desert modern architect E. Stewart Williams in 1965 and built between 1966 and 1976. Williams&#x27; brutalist design contrasts with the steep terrain of the area and was chosen in part because it provided a firebreak from the surrounding environment.
One of the most famous brutalist buildings in the United States is Geisel Library at the University of California, San Diego. Designed by William Pereira and built 1969–70, it is said to &quot;occup[y] a fascinating nexus between brutalism and futurism&quot; but was originally intended as a modernist building in steel and glass before cost considerations meant the structural elements were redesigned in concrete and moved to the outside of the building. Evans Woollen III&#x27;s brutalist Clowes Memorial Hall, a performing arts facility that opened in 1963 on the campus of Butler University in Indianapolis, was praised for its bold and dramatic design. The University of Minnesota&#x27;s West Bank campus features the Rarig Center, a performing arts venue by Ralph Rapson from 1971 that has been called &quot;the best example in the Twin Cities of the style called Brutalism&quot;. Faner Hall at Southern Illinois University Carbondale has long been controversial for its use of brutalism and has been considered an eyesore on campus, deemed to have a &quot;facade only a mother could love&quot; by the university itself.

The Joseph Mark Lauinger Library, the main library of the Georgetown University Library System, was designed by John Carl Warnecke and opened in 1970. Originally conceived with a traditional design similar to other buildings at Georgetown University, the final design of the Lauinger Library embraces brutalism and was intended as a modern interpretation of the nearby Healy Hall, a Flemish Romanesque building. The building once received the Award of Merit by the American Institute of Architects in 1976 for distinguished accomplishment in library architecture. However, in recent years, as public attitudes towards brutalism have shifted, the library has been referred to as one of the &quot;ugliest&quot; buildings in Georgetown and Washington, D.C.
Examples of brutalist university campuses can be found in other countries as well. The Robarts Library at the University of Toronto was designed by Warner, Burns, Toan &amp; Lunde and built between 1968 and 1973. Although it has been called &quot;a crowning achievement of the brutalist movement&quot;, its opening in 1974 came after public sentiment had turned against brutalism, leading to it being condemned as &quot;a blunder on the grandest scale&quot;. Rand Afrikaans University in Johannesburg, South Africa (now Kingsway Campus Auckland Park, University of Johannesburg) is largely brutalist, designed as an expression of Afrikaans identity. Several universities in Southeast Asia also feature brutalist designs, including those at the Ho Chi Minh City Medicine and Pharmaceutical University, the Royal University of Phnom Penh, and the Industrial College of Hue. 

== Reception ==
A 2014 article in &quot;The Economist&quot; noted its unpopularity with the public, observing that a campaign to demolish a building will usually be directed against a brutalist one. According to Simon Jenkins, &quot;Few styles in history can have been met with so many pleas from its users to see it destroyed.&quot; In 2005, the British TV programme &quot;Demolition&quot; ran a public vote to select twelve buildings that ought to be demolished, and eight of those selected were brutalist buildings.

One argument is that this criticism exists in part because concrete façades do not age well in damp, cloudy maritime climates such as those of northwestern Europe and New England. In these climates, the concrete becomes streaked with water stains and sometimes with moss and lichen, and rust stains from the steel reinforcing bars.

Critics of the style find it unappealing due to its &quot;cold&quot; appearance, projecting an atmosphere of totalitarianism, as well as the association of the buildings with urban decay due to materials weathering poorly in certain climates and the surfaces being prone to vandalism by graffiti. Despite this, the style is appreciated by others, and preservation efforts are taking place in the United Kingdom.

== In the 21st century ==
Although the Brutalist movement was largely over by the late 1970s and early 1980s, having largely given way to Structural Expressionism and Deconstructivism, it has experienced a resurgence of interest since 2015 with the publication of a variety of guides and books, including &quot;Brutal London&quot; (Zupagrafika, 2015), &quot;Brutalist London Map&quot; (2015), &quot;This Brutal World&quot; (2016), &quot;SOS Brutalism: A Global Survey&quot; (2017), and the lavish &quot;Atlas of Brutalist Architecture&quot; (Phaidon, 2018).

Many of the defining aspects of the style have been softened in newer buildings, with concrete façades often being sandblasted to create a stone-like surface, covered in stucco, or composed of patterned, precast elements. These elements are also found in renovations of older Brutalist buildings, such as the redevelopment of Sheffield&#x27;s Park Hill. However, board-marked concrete in the brutalist tradition is still used in some developments, such as the neobrutalist Silberrad Student Centre and library extension at the University of Essex, designed to be sympathetic to the existing 1960s brutalist campus buildings and taking &quot;the opportunity to use in-situ brutalist concrete as a sensitive contextual material&quot;.
Villa Göth was listed as historically significant by the Uppsala county administrative board on 3 March 1995. Several brutalist buildings in the United Kingdom have been granted listed status as historic, and others, such as Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia&#x27;s St. Peter&#x27;s Seminary, named by &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine&#x27;s survey of architects as Scotland&#x27;s greatest post-war building, have been the subject of conservation campaigns. Similar buildings in the United States have been recognized, such as the Pirelli Tire Building in New Haven&#x27;s Long Wharf. The Twentieth Century Society has unsuccessfully campaigned against the demolition of British buildings such as the Tricorn Centre and Trinity Square multi-storey car park, made famous by its prominent role in the film &quot;Get Carter&quot;, but successfully in the case of Preston bus station garage, London&#x27;s Hayward Gallery, and others.

Notable buildings that have been demolished include the Smithsons&#x27; Robin Hood Gardens (2017) in East London, John Madin&#x27;s Birmingham Central Library (2016), Marcel Breuer&#x27;s American Press Institute Building in Reston, Virginia, Araldo Cossutta&#x27;s Third Church of Christ, Scientist in Washington, D.C. (2014), and the Welbeck Street car park in London (2019).

<doc id="424950" wikidata="Q1053717" url="?curid=424950" title="Awaji Province">
<text>was an old province of Japan covering Awaji Island, between Honshū and Shikoku. Today it is part of Hyōgo Prefecture. It is sometimes called . Awaji is divided into three municipal sections: Awaji is the northernmost section, Sumoto is the most urban and central section, and four southern towns make up the city of Minamiawaji.

It was founded in the 7th century as a part of Nankaidō. In Nankaidō, Awaji Province was between Kii Province and Awa Province. Awaji means literally &quot;Road to Awa&quot;, that is, the road to Awa Province from the central part of Japan. Awaji Province was divided into two districts: Tsuna no Kōri in the northern part and Mihara no Kōri in the southern part.

The provincial government was presumably in modern Minamiawaji, Hyōgo but its relics have not been found yet.

Awaji Province was a common destination for political exiles. Emperor Junnin was exiled in Awaji after his abdication until his death.

In the Edo period, Awaji Province was governed by the Hachisuka clan in Tokushima, Awa Province. When the han system were abolished and prefectures were organized, the inhabitants of Awaji Province preferred to belong to Hyōgo Prefecture, not to Tokushima Prefecture, because of political conflict between Tokushima and Awaji.

<doc id="424954" wikidata="Q726847" url="?curid=424954" title="Babylonian calendar">
<text>The Babylonian calendar was a lunisolar calendar used in Mesopotamia from around the 2nd millennium BC until the Seleucid Era (294 BC), and it was specifically used in Babylon from the Old Babylonian Period (1780s BC) until the Seleucid Era. 

In the Seleucid Era it was reformed as &quot;Greek time&quot;, Anno Graecorum was introduced and used in the Hellenistic and Jewish worlds of the Middle East and Egypt until the middle of the first millennium when Islam conquered Babylon and the First Council of Nicaea AD 325 defined the Church year based on the Roman early Julian calendar. As Anno Graecorum formed the basis for time references in the Bible and spread westward, it rather increased the Babylonian calendars importance. The Babylonian calendar is also partly reflected in calendars in South and East Asia and the Islamic calendar as well as Iranian calendars. The Julian calendar inherited the definitions of the 12 month system, week, hour etc. from the Babylonian calendar and the current Jewish calendar can be seen as a slightly modified Babylonian calendar that still exists today and is practised, but with Anno Mundi &quot;Livryat haOlam&quot; year calculation since the creation of the world. Today&#x27;s global time system UTC (Gregorian calendar) therefore has its main structure inherited from the Babylonian calendar.

The Julian calendars have their month definitions in tabular form while the Babylonian calendar, the Jewish calendar, and the Muslim calendar have their months defined by the appearance of the new moon and Iranian calendars by solstice.

The civil lunisolar calendar was used contemporaneously with an administrative calendar of 360 days, with the latter used only in fiscal or astronomical contexts. The lunisolar calendar descends from an older Sumerian calendar used in the 4th and 3rd millennium BC.

The civil lunisolar calendar had years consisting of 12 lunar months, each beginning when a new crescent moon was first sighted low on the western horizon at sunset, plus an intercalary month inserted as needed, at first by decree and then later systematically according to what is now known as the Metonic cycle.

Month names from the Babylonian calendar appear in the Hebrew calendar, Assyrian calendar, Syriac calendar, Old Persian calendar, and Turkish calendar.

== Civil calendar ==
The Babylonian civil calendar, also called the cultic calendar, was a lunisolar calendar descended from the Nippur calendar, which has evidence of use as early as 2600 BCE and descended from the even older Third Dynasty of Ur (Ur III) calendar. The original Sumerian names of the months are seen in the orthography for the next couple millennia, albeit in more and more shortened forms. When the calendar came into use in Babylon circa 1780 BCE, the spoken month names became a mix from the calendars of the local subjugated cities, which were Akkadian. Historians agree that it was probably Samsu-iluna who effected this change. During the sixth century BCE Babylonian captivity of the Jews, these month names were adopted into the Hebrew calendar.

The first month of the civil calendar during the Ur III and Old Babylonian periods was &quot;Šekinku&quot; (Akk. &quot;Addaru&quot;), or the month of barley harvesting, and it aligned with the vernal equinox. However, during the intervening Nippur period, it was the twelfth month instead.

Until the 5th century BCE, the calendar was fully observational, and the intercalary month was inserted approximately every two to three years, at first by guidelines which survive in the MUL.APIN tablet. Beginning in around 499 BCE, the intercalation began to be regulated by a predictable lunisolar cycle, so that 19 years comprised 235 months. Although this 19-year cycle is usually called the Metonic cycle after Meton of Athens (432 BCE), the Babylonians used this cycle before Meton, and it may be that Meton learned of the cycle from the Babylonians. After no more than three isolated exceptions, by 380 BCE the months of the calendar were regulated by the cycle without exception. In the cycle of 19 years, the month &quot;Addaru&quot; &quot;2&quot; was intercalated, except in the year that was number 17 in the cycle, when the month &quot;Ulūlu 2&quot; was inserted instead.

During this period, the first day of each month (beginning at sunset) continued to be the day when a new crescent moon was first sighted—the calendar never used a specified number of days in any month. However, as astronomical science grew in Babylon, the appearance of the new moon was predictable with some accuracy into the short-term future. Still, during the Neo-Assyrian period (c. 700 BCE) the calendar was sometimes retroactively &quot;shifted back&quot; a day to account for the fact that the king should have declared a new month, but only did so the following day because of obstructive weather.

== Accuracy ==
As a lunisolar calendar, the civil calendar aimed to keep calendar months in sync with the synodic month and calendar years in sync with the tropical year. Since new months of the civil calendar were declared by observing the crescent moon, the calendar months could not drift from the synodic month. On the other hand, since the length of a calendar year was handled by the Metonic cycle starting after 499 BCE, there is some inherent drift present in the formulaic computation of the new year when compared to the true new year. While on any given year the first day of the first month could be up to 20 days off from the vernal equinox, on average the length of a year was very well approximated by the Metonic cycle; the computed average length is within 30 minutes of the true solar year length.

== Administrative calendar ==

Since the civil calendar was not standardized and predictable for at least the first millennium of its use, a second calendar system thrived in Babylon during the same time spans, known today as the administrative or schematic calendar. The administrative year consisted of 12 months of exactly 30 days each. In the 4th and 3rd millennia BCE, extra months were occasionally intercalated (in which case the year is 390 days), but by the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE it did not make any intercalations or modifications to the 360-day year. This calendar saw use in areas requiring precision in dates or long-term planning; there is tablet evidence demonstrating it was used to date business transactions and astronomical observations, and that mathematics problems, wage calculations, and tax calculations all assumed the administrative calendar instead of the civil calendar.

Babylonian astronomers in particular made all astral calculations and predictions in terms of the administrative calendar. Discrepancies were accounted for in different ways according to the heavenly measurements being taken. When predicting the phase of the moon, it was treated as if each ideal month began with a new moon, even though this could not be true. In fact, this guideline appears in the MUL.APIN, which goes on further to specify that months that began &quot;too early&quot; (on the 30th of the previous month) were considered unlucky, and months that began &quot;on time&quot; (the day after the 30th of the previous month) were considered auspicious. When discussing the dates of equinoxes and solstices, the events were assigned fixed days of the administrative calendar, with shortening or lengthening of intervening days taking place to ensure that the celestial phenomena would fall on the &quot;correct&quot; day. Which fixed day each phenomenon was assigned varied throughout time, for one because which month was designated first varied throughout history. In general, they were assigned to the 15th day of four equally spaced months.

== Seven-day week and Sabbath ==
Counting from the new moon, the Babylonians celebrated every seventh day as a &quot;holy-day&quot;, also called an &quot;evil-day&quot; (meaning &quot;unsuitable&quot; for prohibited activities). On these days officials were prohibited from various activities and common men were forbidden to &quot;make a wish&quot;, and at least the 28th was known as a &quot;rest-day&quot;. On each of them, offerings were made to a different god and goddess, apparently at nightfall to avoid the prohibitions: Marduk and Ishtar on the 7th, Ninlil and Nergal on the 14th, Sin and Shamash on the 21st, and Enki and Mah on the 28th. Tablets from the sixth-century BC reigns of Cyrus the Great and Cambyses II indicate these dates were sometimes approximate. The lunation of 29 or 30 days basically contained three seven-day weeks, and a final week of eight or nine days inclusive, breaking the continuous seven-day cycle.

Among other theories of &quot;Shabbat&quot; origin, the &quot;Universal Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; of Isaac Landman advanced a theory of Assyriologists like Friedrich Delitzsch that &quot;Shabbat&quot; originally arose from the lunar cycle, containing four weeks ending in Sabbath, plus one or two additional unreckoned days per month. The difficulties of this theory include reconciling the differences between an unbroken week and a lunar week, and explaining the absence of texts naming the lunar week as &quot;Shabbat&quot; in any language.

The rarely attested &quot;Sapattum&quot; or &quot;Sabattum&quot; as the full moon is cognate or merged with Hebrew &quot;Shabbat&quot;, but is monthly rather than weekly; it is regarded as a form of Sumerian &quot;sa-bat&quot; (&quot;mid-rest&quot;), attested in Akkadian as &quot;um nuh libbi&quot; (&quot;day of mid-repose&quot;). According to Marcello Craveri, Sabbath &quot;was almost certainly derived from the Babylonian &quot;Shabattu&quot;, the festival of the full moon, but, all trace of any such origin having been lost, the Hebrews ascribed it to Biblical legend.&quot; This conclusion is a contextual restoration of the damaged &quot;Enûma Eliš&quot; creation account, which is read as: &quot;[Sa]bbath shalt thou then encounter, mid[month]ly.&quot;

== Impact ==
The Akkadian names for months surface in a number of calendars still used today. In Iraq and the Levant, the solar Gregorian calendar system is used, with Classical Arabic names replacing the Roman ones, and the month names in the Assyrian calendar descend directly from Aramaic, which descended from Akkadian. Similarly, while Turkey uses the Gregorian calendar in the present day, the names of Turkish months were inspired by the 1839 Rumi calendar of the Ottoman Empire, itself derived from the Ottoman fiscal calendar of 1677 based on the Julian calendar. This last calendar month names of both Syriac and Islamic origin, and in the modern calendar four of these names descend from the original Akkadian names.

<text>Perfume: The Story of a Murderer ( ) is a 1985 literary historical fantasy novel by German writer Patrick Süskind. The novel explores the sense of smell and its relationship with the emotional meanings that scents may have.

The story follows Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, an unloved orphan in 18th-century France who is born with an exceptional sense of smell, capable of distinguishing a vast range of scents in the world around him. Grenouille becomes a perfumer but later becomes involved in murder when he encounters a young girl with an unsurpassed wondrous scent.

With translations into 49 languages and more than 20 million copies sold worldwide to date, &quot;Perfume&quot; is one of the best-selling German novels of the 20th century. The title remained in bestseller lists for about nine years and received almost unanimously positive national and international critical acclaim. It was translated into English by John E. Woods and won both the World Fantasy Award and the PEN Translation Prize in 1987. Some editions of the novel, including the first, have as their cover image Antoine Watteau&#x27;s painting, &quot;Jupiter and Antiope&quot;, which depicts a sleeping woman.

==Plot==

=== Part One ===
A boy is born in Paris, France in the year 1738, and subsequently abandoned. His mother is tried almost immediately for previous infanticide and subsequently executed, leaving him an orphan. He is named &quot;Jean-Baptiste Grenouille&quot; (&quot;grenouille&quot; being the French word for &quot;frog&quot;) and is fostered but is a difficult, solitary child and is eventually apprenticed to a local tanner. Unknown to other people, Grenouille has a remarkable sense of smell, giving him an extraordinary ability to discern subtlest odors from complex mixtures of scent and across great distances.

One day, long after having memorized nearly all the smells of the city, Grenouille is surprised by a unique smell. He finds the source of the scent: a young virgin girl. Entranced by her scent and believing that he alone must possess it, he strangles her and stays with her body until the scent has left it. In his quest to learn more about the art of perfume-making, he becomes apprenticed to one of the city&#x27;s finest perfumers, Giuseppe Baldini, an aging, unskilled perfumer who has managed a successful business from two perfumes: one given to him by a relative and one that he bought from a traveling agent. Baldini eventually finds himself increasingly outperformed by rival perfumers and considers moving back to Italy with his wife. 

However, Grenouille proves himself a prodigy by copying and improving a rival&#x27;s perfume in Baldini&#x27;s laboratory, after which Baldini offers him an apprenticeship. Baldini teaches Grenouille the basic techniques of perfumery while selling Grenouille&#x27;s masterful new formulas as his own, restoring his flagging reputation. Baldini eventually reveals to Grenouille that there are techniques other than distillation that can be used to preserve a wider range of odours, which can only be learned in the heartland of the perfumer&#x27;s craft, in the region of Grasse in the French Riviera. Shortly after, Grenouille elects to leave Paris, and Baldini dies when his shop collapses into the river Seine.

=== Part Two ===
On his way to Grasse, Grenouille travels the countryside and is increasingly disgusted by the scent of humanity. Avoiding civilization, he comes instead to live in a cave inside the Plomb du Cantal, surviving off the mountain&#x27;s sparse vegetation and wildlife. However, his peace is ended when he realizes after seven years that he himself does not possess any scent: he cannot smell himself and neither, he finally understands, can other people. Traveling to Montpellier with a fabricated story about being kidnapped and kept in a cave for seven years to account for his haggard appearance, he creates a body odour for himself from everyday materials and finds that his new &quot;disguise&quot; tricks people into thinking that it is the scent of a human; he is now accepted by society instead of shunned. In Montpellier, he gains the patronage of the Marquis de La Taillade-Espinasse, who uses Grenouille to publicize his pseudoscientific theory about the influence of &quot;fluidal&quot; energies on human vitality. Grenouille manufactures perfumes which successfully distort the public perception of him from a wretched &quot;caveman&quot; into a clean and cultivated patrician, helping to win enormous popularity for the Marquis&#x27; theory. Seeing how easily humanity can be fooled by a simple scent, Grenouille&#x27;s hatred becomes contempt. He realizes that it is within his ability to develop scents described as &quot;superhuman&quot; and &quot;angelic&quot; that will affect in unprecedented ways how other people perceive him.

=== Part Three ===
In Grasse, Grenouille discovers a young woman named Laure whose scent has the same captivating quality of the girl he killed before. Determined to preserve it, Grenouille starts working as an apprentice at a workshop and starts learning how to preserve scents by enfleurage, determined to kill Laure and extract her scent in a year&#x27;s time. Meanwhile, he kills 24 other young women, to practice how to preserve human scents and to use them as a base for the perfume that he will make with Laure&#x27;s scent.
Laure&#x27;s father deduces that Laure will eventually be killed and tries to flee to save his daughter, but Grenouille tracks them and kills Laure as well.
Despite his careful attention to detail, the police trace Laure&#x27;s murder to him, and the hair and clothing of his previous victims are all discovered at his cabin near Grasse. He is caught soon afterwards and sentenced to death. However, on the way to his execution in the town square, Grenouille wears the new perfume he has created from his victims, and the scent immediately causes the crowd of spectators to fawn in awe and adoration of him, and although the evidence of his guilt is absolute, the townspeople become so fond of him, so convinced of the innocence he now exudes, that the magistrate reverses the court&#x27;s verdict and he is freed; even Laure&#x27;s father is enthralled by the new scent and asks if he would consider being adopted as his son. Soon the crowd is so overcome with lust and emotion that the entire town participates in a mass orgy of which no one speaks afterwards and which few can clearly remember. The magistrate reopens the investigation into the murders and they are eventually attributed to Grenouille&#x27;s employer Dominique Druot, who is tortured into making a false confession and later hanged without ceremony. Afterwards, life returns to normal in Grasse.

=== Part Four ===
The effect his scent has had now confirms to Grenouille how much he hates people, especially as he realizes that they worship him now and that even this degree of control does not give him satisfaction. He decides to return to Paris, intending to die there, and after a long journey ends up at the fish market where he was born. He pours the bottle of perfume he created on himself, and the people are so drawn to him that they are compelled to obtain parts of his body, eventually tearing him to pieces and eating him. The story ends with the crowd, now embarrassed by their actions, agreeing that they did it out of &quot;love&quot;.

==Characters==
In order of appearance:
* Grenouille&#x27;s mother – Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was her fifth baby. She had claimed her first four were stillbirths or &quot;semi-stillbirths&quot;. In her mid-twenties, with most of her teeth left, &quot;some hair on her head&quot;, and a touch of gout, syphilis, and consumption, she was still quite pretty.
* Jean-Baptiste Grenouille – The novel&#x27;s protagonist, born 17 July 1738 with an innate prodigious sense of smell (and also for unexplained reasons no personal scent of his own). His awareness of scent eventually causes him to conceive of capturing human scents, specifically those able to inspire love, which he lacks in his life. When he does succeed in this goal, he discovers it gives him no pleasure, and causes him only to despise others for being so easily fooled. Unable to find happiness, he is killed by a crowd after he pours his final perfume over himself. Grenouille&#x27;s motivation for killing is described in the novel as purely the result of his desire to possess those rare scents capable of inspiring love towards their possessor:

* Jeanne Bussie – One of Grenouille&#x27;s many wet-nurses. She is the first person to realise he does not have a scent and claims he is sucking all the life out of her.
* Father Terrier – A clergyman in charge of the church&#x27;s charities and the distribution of its money to the poor and needy. He first thinks Grenouille is a cute baby, but once Grenouille begins to sniff Terrier, the priest becomes worried and sends the baby to a boarding house.
* Madame Gaillard – She does not have a sense of smell, due to being hit across the face with a poker during her younger years, so she does not know that Grenouille is scentless. In charge of a boarding house, her goal in life is to save enough money to have a proper death and funeral. Madame&#x27;s poor sense of smell and ignorance about Grenouille&#x27;s gifts, coupled with his assistance in finding her hidden money through his olfactory ability, cause Madame to believe he is psychic. Believing that psychic people bring bad luck and death, Madame sells Grenouille to the tanner Grimal. She loses all her money in old age, dies a miserable death in the Hôtel Dieu, and is not even buried individually after her death, but rather thrown into a mass grave.
* Children at the Boarding House – They are repulsed by Grenouille and even try, in vain, to suffocate him with rags and blankets while Grenouille is asleep.
* Grimal – A tanner who lives near the river in the rue de la Mortellerie. Grenouille works for him from age eight into his early youth until Baldini pays for him to be released. Grimal wastes this immense new income on an alcoholic binge; his drunkenness causes him to fall into a river and drown.
* The Plum Girl – Her natural scent is that of sea breeze, water lilies, and apricot blossoms; it is a rich, perfectly balanced, and magical scent. She has red hair and wears a gray, sleeveless dress. She is halving plums when Grenouille kills her as his first victim. Unable to retain her scent, her death motivates his quest to learn how human scent may be preserved.
* Giuseppe Baldini – An old traditional perfumer who sees his once-great reputation now fading away. He yearns for the old days when tastes in perfume did not change so quickly, and is angry at what he feels are upstarts in the now fast-moving perfume trade. He knows secretly that he never had a particular gift for creating and analyzing new scents; rather he had obtained the recipes which made his reputation from other sources. Lacking natural talent, he merely knows the art and business of perfumery and maintains a strict mystique to conceal the truth. His shop, located in the middle of the bridge Pont-au-Change, is filled with a mixture of scents so intoxicating that it scares away most potential customers. Baldini reluctantly permits Grenouille to demonstrate the copying of a competitor&#x27;s perfume and is about to send Grenouille away when he realizes the copy is a faithful one; Grenouille then creates on the spot an exceptionally improved version of the original. Recognizing Grenouille&#x27;s genius, Baldini buys him from Grimal as his apprentice and starts to rebuild his declining business. He becomes rich and famous once again from the new perfumes that Grenouille creates for him, though does not credit Grenouille for his contributions. He eventually gives Grenouille his journeyman papers. The very same night that Grenouille leaves Paris, Baldini&#x27;s house and shop plunge into the river Seine when the bridge collapses, and the recipes for hundreds of Grenouille&#x27;s perfumes are lost.
* Chénier – Baldini&#x27;s assistant and apprentice for more than 30 years. He is somewhat younger than Baldini. He knows Baldini is talentless, but still boasts Baldini&#x27;s skills in the hope that one day he will inherit Baldini&#x27;s perfume shop.
* Pélissier – Baldini&#x27;s chief rival, considered the most innovative perfumer in Paris despite not having any formal training. He is only mentioned and never appears in the novel.
* Marquis de La Taillade-Espinasse – Liege lord of the town of Pierrefort and a member of parliament. He is an amateur scientist who develops indulgent and ridiculous theses (his &quot;fluidal theory&quot;), which he attempts to demonstrate on Grenouille — also feeding him, providing him with new clothes, and giving him the opportunity to create a perfume. The Marquis dies soon after Grenouille&#x27;s &quot;disappearance&quot;, while pursuing his fluidal theory by attempting to live alone on the Pic du Canigou, a secluded mountain.
* Madame Arnulfi – A lively, black-haired woman of about thirty years of age. She has been widowed for almost a year. She owns the perfume business of her dead husband and has a journeyman named Druot, who is also her paramour. She hires Grenouille as her second journeyman.
* Dominique Druot – Madame Arnulfi&#x27;s journeyman and paramour. He is the size of a Hun and is of average intelligence. Grenouille works for him as second journeyman. Druot is later hanged for Grenouille&#x27;s crimes.
* Antoine Richis – Second consul and the richest man in Grasse, and Laure&#x27;s father.
* Laure Richis – A beautiful red-headed girl, daughter of Antoine Richis, and the second girl whose scent is perceived as demanding capture by Grenouille. She is the inspiration for his lengthy killing spree as well as his final victim.

==Possible inspiration==
The real-life story of Spanish serial killer Manuel Blanco Romasanta (1809-1863), also known as the &quot;Tallow-Man&quot;, who killed several women and children, sold their clothes, and extracted their body-fat to make soap, resembles Grenouille&#x27;s methods in some ways.

The name of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille might be inspired by the French perfumer Paul Grenouille, who changed his name into Grenoville when he opened his luxury perfume house in 1879.

==Style==
The style of the novel can be characterized by the way it blends fantasy and fiction with factual information. That combination creates two distinguishable narrative lines - the fantastic one, which is conveyed in Grenouille&#x27;s supernatural sense of smell, his odorlessness, and fairy-tale tones in the story, as well as the realistic one, composed of the socio-historical circumstances of the plot and naturalistic descriptions of the environment, the perfume production and murders. The novel’s realism is also visible in thorough descriptions of historical perfumery practices. According to Rindisbacher, the work &quot;gathered together and phrased in popular terms the state of the art of olfactory and perfumistic knowledge and spun it into the realm of fantasy and imagination&quot;.

The diction of the novel evokes vivid sensory images. It links typically visual cognitive activities with the sense of smell, which is represented by the way Grenouille perceives the world. He understands more through olfaction, rather than vision, and that is reflected in the language of the novel, as the verbs in the literature normally associated with visual perception relate, in Grenouille’s case, to the process of smelling.

Another conspicuous stylistic feature of the work is an extensive use of intertextuality, which has been met with both positive and negative critical response. Literary allusions identified by the critics include references to works by Flaubert, Balzac, Baudelaire, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Thomas Mann, and Goethe. In the literature, for instance, there were observed some resemblances to the story of &quot;Faust&quot;. While &quot;Perfume&quot; received much praise for being original and imaginative, its citational structure has been either received enthusiastically for speaking to the literary acumen of the reader, or recognized as problematic, due to the overload of constant allusion and &quot;pastiche&quot;, or being considered a “parody” of other works.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
* &quot;&quot;, co-written and directed by Tom Tykwer (who also composed the score), premiered in Germany on 14 September 2006.
* &quot;The Perfumier&quot;, was released for streaming on Netflix on 21 September 2022.

===Television===
* The episode &quot;Sense Memory&quot; (2011) of the American television show &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; bears many similarities to the novel.
* A six-part 2018 German television series, &quot;Perfume&quot; (&quot;Parfum&quot;), inspired by the novel and the film but set in the present day, stars Friederike Becht, Juergen Maurer, Wotan Wilke Möhring, and Christian Friedel.
*The episodes &quot;The Gang Goes to Ireland and The Gang&#x27;s Still in Ireland&quot; (2021) of the American satire television show &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; allude to the novel as Dennis searches for an authentic redhaired woman to smell her hair, as they give off a &#x27;pleasant odor&#x27; he is then frustrated when the woman who&#x27;s hair he smells has no distinctive scent and insists she is a liar, this is then once more referenced in the following episode, explained by him experiencing psychosis brought on by a fever.

===Music===
* A Russian musical adaptation of the novel, &quot;Perfumer&quot;, premiered on 5 December 2010 in Moscow. Composer and singer Igor Demarin received Süskind&#x27;s approval after communicating with a representative of Süskind for two years.
* The song &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot; by the American grunge band Nirvana, from their 1993 album &quot;In Utero&quot;, was inspired by the novel &quot;Perfume&quot;. In an interview, lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain described the novel as one of his favourite books, which he re-read ten times and kept near him.
* The song &quot;Herr Spiegelmann&quot; from the Portuguese gothic-doom metal band Moonspell at Napalm records contains an excerpt from the book.
* The song &quot;Red Head Girl&quot; by French downtempo duo Air is inspired by &quot;Perfume&quot;.
* The song &quot;Du riechst so gut&quot; (German for &quot;You smell so good&quot;) by Rammstein was inspired by the novel, which is one of lead singer Till Lindemann&#x27;s favourite books.
* Marilyn Manson credits the novel as one of the inspirations behind the title of his second album, &quot;Smells Like Children&quot;.
* The song &quot;Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met)&quot; by Panic! at the Disco is inspired by &quot;Perfume&quot;.
* The song &quot;향 (Scentist)&quot; by K-pop boy group VIXX and its music video are based on the novel.
* Perfume Genius&#x27; stage name was inspired by Tom Tykwer&#x27;s film adaptation.

===Sport===
* Russian figure skater Anna Shcherbakova performed her 2019 season short program to excerpts from the film&#x27;s score while portraying the &#x27;leitmotiv&#x27; from the book: &quot;defenselessness, the doom of beauty in the face of senseless cruelty&quot;. Her routine was staged by choreographer Daniil Gleikhengauz.

<doc id="424957" wikidata="Q907457" url="?curid=424957" title="Awa Province (Tokushima)">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area that is today Tokushima Prefecture on the island of Shikoku. Awa was bordered by Tosa, Sanuki, and Iyo Provinces. Its abbreviated form name was . In terms of the Gokishichidō system, Awa was one of the provinces of the Nankaidō circuit. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Awa was ranked as one of the 35 &quot;superior countries&quot; (上国) in terms of importance, and one of the &quot;middle countries&quot; (中国) in terms of distance from the capital. The provincial capital was located in what is now the city of Tokushima. 

==History==
Awa has been settled since the Japanese Paleolithic and the remains of Yayoi and Kofun period settlements and burial mounds have been found especially in the fertile Yoshino River valley. Per the &quot;Kogo Shūi,&quot; the name of the province was originally written &quot;粟国&quot; and was associated with the production of millet. Per the &quot;Kujiki&quot;, the &quot;kuni no miyatsuko&quot; of Awa was a ninth generation descendant of Takamimusubi who had been appointed by Emperor Ōjin. The name of the province was changed to &quot;阿波&quot; in 713 by Empress Genmei as rules for provincial names had been standardized under the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; codes to consist of two &quot;kanji&quot;. During the Kamakura period, the Sasaki clan and the Ogasawara clan were &quot;shugo&quot; of the province. They were replaced by the Hosokawa clan during the Muromachi period; however, by the Sengoku period, the Hosokawa had been supplanted by the Miyoshi clan, who under Miyoshi Nagayoshi grew in power to rule over large portions of the Kinai region. When the Miyoshi clan became weakened by internal conflicts, the forces of Chōsokabe Motochika of Tosa Province invaded, and by 1585 was able to unify Shikoku under his rule. However, almost immediately, Hashiba Hideyoshi ordered his armies to invade. The Chōsokabe were defeated after two months and forced back to Tōsa. Awa Province was awarded to one of Hideyoshi&#x27;s generals, Hachisuka Masakatsu, but he turned the province over to his son Hachisuka Iemasa due to his advanced age. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the Hachisuka clan continued to rule Awa (and neighboring Awaji Province) from their stronghold at Tokushima Castle to the end of the Edo Period. Tokushima Domain had a nominal &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 257,000 &quot;koku&quot;, making it the 17th largest domain. Following the Meiji restoration and the abolition of the han system in 1871, Awa became &quot;Myōdō Prefecture&quot; (名東県), which was merged into Kagawa Prefecture. In 1875, the former Sanuki Province was separated out, and in 1876, former Awaji Province was assigned to Hyōgo Prefecture. The former Awa Province was merged with Kōchi Prefecture. In 1880, the former Awa Province was separated from Kōchi to become Tokushima Prefecture. Per the early Meiji period , an official government assessment of the nation’s resources, the province had 584 villages with a total &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 306,632 &quot;koku&quot;.

<doc id="424964" wikidata="Q194173" url="?curid=424964" title="Water clock">
<text>A water clock, or clepsydra (; ; ), is a timepiece by which time is measured by the regulated flow of liquid into (inflow type) or out from (outflow type) a vessel, and where the amount of liquid can then be measured.

Water clocks are some of the oldest time-measuring instruments. The simplest form of water clock, with a bowl-shaped outflow, existed in Babylon, Egypt, and Persia around the 16th century BC. Other regions of the world, including India and China, also provide early evidence of water clocks, but the earliest dates are less certain. Water clocks were used in ancient Greece and in ancient Rome, as described by technical writers such as Ctesibius (died 222 BC) and Vitruvius (died after 15 BC).
== Designs ==

A water clock uses the flow of water to measure time. If viscosity is neglected, the physical principle required to study such clocks is Torricelli&#x27;s law. Two types of water clock exist: inflow and outflow. In an outflow water clock, a container is filled with water, and the water is drained slowly and evenly out of the container. This container has markings that are used to show the passage of time. As the water leaves the container, an observer can see where the water is level with the lines and tell how much time has passed. An inflow water clock works in basically the same way, except instead of flowing out of the container, the water is filling up the marked container. As the container fills, the observer can see where the water meets the lines and tell how much time has passed.
Some modern timepieces are called &quot;water clocks&quot; but work differently from the ancient ones. Their timekeeping is governed by a pendulum, but they use water for other purposes, such as providing the power needed to drive the clock by using a water wheel or something similar, or by having water in their displays.

The Greeks and Romans advanced water clock design to include the inflow clepsydra with an early feedback system, gearing, and escapement mechanism, which were connected to fanciful automata and resulted in improved accuracy. Further advances were made in Byzantium, Syria, and Mesopotamia, where increasingly accurate water clocks incorporated complex segmental and epicyclic gearing, water wheels, and programmability, advances which eventually made their way to Europe. Independently, the Chinese developed their own advanced water clocks, incorporating gears, escapement mechanisms, and water wheels, passing their ideas on to Korea and Japan.

Some water clock designs were developed independently, and some knowledge was transferred through the spread of trade. These early water clocks were calibrated with a sundial. While never reaching a level of accuracy comparable to today&#x27;s standards of timekeeping, the water clock was a commonly used timekeeping device for millennia, until it was replaced by more accurate verge escapement mechanical clocks in Europe around 1300.

==Regional development==
===Egypt===
The oldest water clock of which there is physical evidence dates to c. 1417–1379 BC in the New Kingdom of Egypt, during the reign of the pharaoh Amenhotep III, where it was used in the Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak. The oldest documentation of the water clock is the tomb inscription of the 16th century BC Egyptian court official Amenemhet, which identifies him as its inventor. These simple water clocks, which were of the outflow type, were stone vessels with sloping sides that allowed water to drip at a nearly constant rate from a small hole near the bottom. There were twelve separate columns with consistently spaced markings on the inside to measure the passage of &quot;hours&quot; as the water level reached them. The columns were for each of the twelve months to allow for the variations of the seasonal hours. Priests used these clocks to determine the time at night so that the temple rites and sacrifices could be performed at the correct hour.

===Babylon===

In Babylon, water clocks were of the outflow type and were cylindrical in shape. Use of the water clock as an aid to astronomical calculations dates back to the Old Babylonian Empire (&quot;c.&quot; 2000 – &quot;c.&quot; 1600 BC). While there are no surviving water clocks from the Mesopotamian region, most evidence of their existence comes from writings on clay tablets. Two collections of tablets, for example, are the &quot;Enuma Anu Enlil&quot; (1600–1200 BC) and the &quot;MUL.APIN&quot; (7th century BC). In these tablets, water clocks are used for payment of the night and day watches (guards).

These clocks were unique, as they did not have an indicator such as hands (as are typically used today) or grooved notches (as were used in Egypt). Instead, these clocks measured time &quot;by the weight of water flowing from&quot; it. The volume was measured in capacity units called &quot;qa&quot;. The weight, &quot;mana&quot; or mina (the Greek unit for about one pound), is the weight of water in a water clock.

In Babylonian times, time was measured with temporal hours. So, as seasons changed, so did the length of a day. &quot;To define the length of a &#x27;night watch&#x27; at the summer solstice, one had to pour two mana of water into a cylindrical clepsydra; its emptying indicated the end of the watch. One-sixth of mana had to be added each succeeding half-month. At the equinox, three mana had to be emptied in order to correspond to one watch, and four mana was emptied for each watch of the winter solstitial night.&quot;

===India ===

N. Narahari Achar and Subhash Kak suggest that water clocks were used in ancient India as early as the 2nd millennium BC, based on their appearance in the &quot;Atharvaveda&#x27;.&quot;
According to N. Kameswara Rao, pots excavated from the Indus Valley Civilisation site of Mohenjo-daro may have been used as water clocks. They are tapered at the bottom, have a hole on the side, and are similar to the utensil used to perform &quot;abhiṣeka&quot; (ritual water pouring) on lingams.

The Jyotisha, one of the six Vedanga disciplines, describes water clocks called &quot;ghati&quot; or &quot;kapala&quot; that measure time in units of &quot;nadika&quot; (around 24 minutes). A clepsydra in the form of a floating and sinking copper vessel is mentioned in the &quot;Sürya Siddhānta&quot; (5th century AD). At Nalanda mahavihara, an ancient Buddhist university, four-hour intervals were measured by a water clock, which consisted of a similar copper bowl holding two large floats in a larger bowl filled with water. The bowl was filled with water from a small hole at its bottom; it sank when filled and was marked by the beating of a drum in the daytime. The amount of water added varied with the seasons, and students at the university operated the clock.

Descriptions of similar water clocks are also given in the &quot;Pañca Siddhāntikā&quot; by the polymath Varāhamihira in the 6th century, which adds further detail to the account given in the &quot;Sūrya Siddhānta&quot;. Further descriptions are recorded in the &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot; by the mathematician Brahmagupta in the 7th century. A detailed description with measurements is also recorded by the astronomer Lalla in the 8th century, who describes the &quot;ghati&quot; as a hemispherical copper vessel with a hole that is fully filled after one &quot;nadika&quot;.

===China===
In ancient China, as well as throughout East Asia, water clocks were very important in the study of astronomy and astrology. The oldest written reference dates the use of the water clock in China to the 6th century BC. From about 200 BC onwards, the outflow clepsydra was replaced almost everywhere in China by the inflow type with an indicator-rod borne on a float(called fou chien lou,浮箭漏). The Han dynasty philosopher and politician Huan Tan (40 BC – AD 30), a Secretary at the Court in charge of clepsydrae, wrote that he had to compare clepsydrae with sundials because of how temperature and humidity affected their accuracy, demonstrating that the effects of evaporation, as well as of temperature on the speed at which water flows, were known at this time. The liquid in water clocks was liable to freezing, and had to be kept warm with torches, a problem that was solved in 976 by the Chinese astronomer and engineer Zhang Sixun. His invention—a considerable improvement on Yi Xing&#x27;s clock—used mercury instead of water. Mercury is a liquid at room temperature, and freezes at , lower than any air temperature common outside polar regions. Again, instead of using water, the early Ming Dynasty engineer Zhan Xiyuan (c. 1360–1380) created a sand-driven wheel clock, improved upon by Zhou Shuxue (c. 1530–1558).

The use of clepsydrae to drive mechanisms illustrating astronomical phenomena began with the Han Dynasty polymath Zhang Heng (78–139) in 117, who also employed a waterwheel. Zhang Heng was the first in China to add an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel, which solved the problem of the falling pressure head in the reservoir tank. Zhang&#x27;s ingenuity led to the creation by the Tang dynasty mathematician and engineer Yi Xing (683–727) and Liang Lingzan in 725 of a clock driven by a waterwheel linkwork escapement mechanism. The same mechanism would be used by the Song dynasty polymath Su Song (1020–1101) in 1088 to power his astronomical clock tower, as well as a chain drive. Su Song&#x27;s clock tower, over tall, possessed a bronze power-driven armillary sphere for observations, an automatically rotating celestial globe, and five front panels with doors that permitted the viewing of changing mannequins which rang bells or gongs, and held tablets indicating the hour or other special times of the day. In the 2000s, in Beijing&#x27;s Drum Tower an outflow clepsydra is operational and displayed for tourists. It is connected to automata so that every quarter-hour a small brass statue of a man claps his cymbals.

===Persia===
The use of water clocks in Greater Iran, especially in the desert areas such as Yazd, Isfahan, Zibad, and Gonabad, dates back to 500 BC. Later, they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions such as Nowruz (March equinox), Mehregan (September equinox), Tirgan (summer solstice) and Yaldā Night (winter solstice) – the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years. The water clocks, called &quot;pengan&quot; (and later &quot;fenjan&quot;) used were one of the most practical ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar. The water clock was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation until more accurate current clocks replaced it.

Persian water clocks were a practical, useful, and necessary tool for the qanat&#x27;s shareholders to calculate the length of time they could divert water to their farms or gardens. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation in arid area so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock or &quot;mir āb&quot;, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of hours and announce the exact time of the days and nights from sunrise to sunset because shareholders usually divided between day and night owners.

The Persian water clock consisted of a large pot full of water and a bowl with a small hole in the center. When the bowl became full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again put it on the top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar. The place where the clock was situated and its managers were collectively known as the &quot;khane pengān&quot;. Usually this would be the top floor of a public house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of sunset and sunrise. The Zibad water clock was in use until 1965, when it was replaced by modern clocks.

===Greco-Roman world===
The word &quot;&quot; comes from the Greek meaning &quot;water thief&quot;. The Greeks considerably advanced the water clock by tackling the problem of the diminishing flow. They introduced several types of the inflow clepsydra, one of which included the earliest feedback control system. Ctesibius invented an indicator system typical for later clocks such as the dial and pointer. The Roman engineer Vitruvius described early alarm clocks, working with gongs or trumpets. A commonly used water clock was the simple outflow clepsydra. This small earthenware vessel had a hole in its side near the base. In both Greek and Roman times, this type of clepsydra was used in courts for allocating periods of time to speakers. In important cases, such as when a person&#x27;s life was at stake, it was filled completely, but for more minor cases, only partially. If proceedings were interrupted for any reason, such as to examine documents, the hole in the clepsydra was stopped with wax until the speaker was able to resume his pleading.

====Clepsydrae for keeping time====
Some scholars suspect that the clepsydra may have been used as a stop-watch for imposing a time limit on clients&#x27; visits in Athenian brothels. Slightly later, in the early 3rd century BC, the Hellenistic physician Herophilos employed a portable clepsydra on his house visits in Alexandria for measuring his patients&#x27; pulse-beats. By comparing the rate by age group with empirically obtained data sets, he was able to determine the intensity of the disorder.

Between 270 BC and AD 500, Hellenistic (Ctesibius, Hero of Alexandria, Archimedes) and Roman horologists and astronomers were developing more elaborate mechanized water clocks. The added complexity was aimed at regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks rang bells and gongs, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and dials. Some even displayed astrological models of the universe. The 3rd century BC engineer Philo of Byzantium referred in his works to water clocks already fitted with an escapement mechanism, the earliest known of its kind.

The biggest achievement of the invention of clepsydrae during this time, however, was by Ctesibius with his incorporation of gears and a dial indicator to automatically show the time as the lengths of the days changed throughout the year, because of the temporal timekeeping used during his day. Also, a Greek astronomer, Andronicus of Cyrrhus, supervised the construction of his Horologion, known today as the Tower of the Winds, in the Athens marketplace (or agora) in the first half of the 1st century BC. This octagonal clocktower showed scholars and shoppers both sundials and a windvane. Inside it was a mechanized clepsydra, although the type of display it used cannot be known for sure; some possibilities are: a rod that moved up and down to display the time, a water-powered automaton that struck a bell to mark the hours, or a moving star disk in the ceiling.

===Medieval Islamic world===
In the medieval Islamic world (632-1280), the use of water clocks has its roots from Archimedes during the rise of Alexandria in Egypt and continues on through Byzantium. The water clocks by the Arabic engineer Al-Jazari, however, are credited for going &quot;well beyond anything&quot; that had preceded them. In Al-Jazari&#x27;s 1206 treatise, he describes one of his water clocks, the elephant clock. The clock recorded the passage of temporal hours, which meant that the rate of flow had to be changed daily to match the uneven length of days throughout the year. To accomplish this, the clock had two tanks, the top tank was connected to the time indicating mechanisms and the bottom was connected to the flow control regulator. Basically, at daybreak, the tap was opened and water flowed from the top tank to the bottom tank via a float regulator that maintained a constant pressure in the receiving tank.

The most sophisticated water-powered astronomical clock was Al-Jazari&#x27;s castle clock, considered by some to be an early example of a programmable analog computer, in 1206. It was a complex device that was about high, and had multiple functions alongside timekeeping. It included a display of the zodiac and the solar and lunar orbits, and a pointer in the shape of the crescent moon which traveled across the top of a gateway, moved by a hidden cart and causing automatic doors to open, each revealing a mannequin, every hour. It was possible to re-program the length of day and night in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year, and it also featured five musician automata who automatically play music when moved by levers operated by a hidden camshaft attached to a water wheel. Other components of the castle clock included a main reservoir with a float, a float chamber and flow regulator, plate and valve trough, two pulleys, crescent disc displaying the zodiac, and two falcon automata dropping balls into vases.

The first water clocks to employ complex segmental and epicyclic gearing was invented earlier by the Arab engineer Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia c. 1000. His water clocks were driven by water wheels, as was also the case for several Chinese water clocks in the 11th century. Comparable water clocks were built in Damascus and Fez. The latter (Dar al-Magana) remains until today and its mechanism has been reconstructed. The first European clock to employ these complex gears was the astronomical clock created by Giovanni de Dondi in c. 1365. Like the Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed an escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. The escapement mechanism was in the form of a constant-head system, while heavy floats were used as weights.

===Korea===


In 718, Unified Silla established the system of clepsydra for the first time in Korean history, imitating the Tang Dynasty. In 1434, during Joseon rule, Jang Yeong-sil (), a palace guard and later chief court engineer, constructed the Borugak Jagyeongnu or self-striking water clock of Borugak Pavillion for Sejong the Great.

What made his water clock self-striking (or automatic) was using jack-work mechanisms: three wooden figures or &quot;jacks&quot; struck objects to signal the time. This innovation no longer required the reliance of human workers, known as &quot;rooster men&quot;, to constantly replenish it.

The uniqueness of the clock was its capability to announce dual-times automatically with visual and audible signals. Jang developed a signal conversion technique that made it possible to measure analog time and announce digital time simultaneously as well as to separate the water mechanisms from the ball-operated striking mechanisms. The conversion device was called &quot;pangmok&quot;, and was placed above the inflow vessel that measured the time, the first device of its kind in the world. Thus, the Borugak water clock is the first hydro-mechanically engineered dual-time clock in the history of horology.

=== Japan ===
Emperor Tenji made Japan&#x27;s first water clock called a . They were highly socially significant and run by 

==Temperature, water viscosity, and clock accuracy==
When viscosity can be neglected, the outflow rate of the water is governed by Torricelli&#x27;s law, or more generally, by Bernoulli&#x27;s principle. Viscosity will dominate the outflow rate if the water flows out through a nozzle that is sufficiently long and thin, as given by the Hagen–Poiseuille equation. Approximately, the flow rate is for such design inversely proportional to the viscosity, which depends on the temperature. Liquids generally become less viscous as the temperature increases. In the case of water, the viscosity varies by a factor of about seven between zero and 100 degrees Celsius. Thus, a water clock with such a nozzle would run about seven times faster at 100 °C than at 0 °C. Water is about 25 percent more viscous at 20 °C than at 30 °C, and a variation in temperature of one degree Celsius, in this &quot;room temperature&quot; range, produces a change of viscosity of about two percent. Therefore, a water clock with such a nozzle that keeps good time at some given temperature would gain or lose about half an hour per day if it were one degree Celsius warmer or cooler. To make it keep time within one minute per day would require its temperature to be controlled within °C (about °F). There is no evidence that this was done in antiquity, so ancient water clocks with sufficiently thin and long nozzles (unlike the modern pendulum-controlled one described above) cannot have been reliably accurate by modern standards. However, while modern timepieces may not be reset for long periods, water clocks were likely reset every day, when refilled, based on a sundial, so the cumulative error would not have been great.

<text>The Duchy of Bohemia, also later referred to in English as the Czech Duchy, (Old Czech: ) was a monarchy and a principality of the Holy Roman Empire in Central Europe during the Early and High Middle Ages. It was formed around 870 by Czechs as part of the Great Moravian realm. Bohemia separated from disintegrating Great Moravia after Duke Spytihněv swore fealty to the East Frankish king Arnulf in 895.

While the Bohemian dukes of the Přemyslid dynasty, at first ruling at Prague Castle and Levý Hradec, brought further estates under their control, the Christianization initiated by Saints Cyril and Methodius was continued by the Frankish bishops of Regensburg and Passau. In 973, the Diocese of Prague was founded through the joint efforts of Duke Boleslaus II and Emperor Otto I. Later Duke Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, killed by his younger brother Boleslaus in September 935, became the land&#x27;s patron saint.

While the lands were occupied by the Polish king Bolesław I and internal struggles shook the Přemyslid dynasty, Duke Vladivoj received Bohemia as a fief from the hands of the East Frankish king Henry II in 1002 and the duchy became an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire. The Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a hereditary Kingdom of Bohemia, when Duke Ottokar I ensured his elevation by the German king Philip of Swabia in 1198. The Přemyslids remained in power throughout the High Middle Ages, until the extinction of the male line with the death of King Wenceslaus III in 1306.

==History==
The lands encompassed by the Bohemian Forest, the Ore Mountains, the Sudetes and the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands were settled by Bohemian tribes about 550. In the 7th century the local Czech people were part of the union led by the Frankish merchant Samo (d. 658). &quot;Bohemia&quot; as a geographical term, probably derived from the Celtic (Gallic) Boii tribes, first appeared in 9th-century Frankish sources. In 805, Emperor Charlemagne prepared to conquer the lands, invading Bohemia in 805 and laying siege to the fortress of Canburg. However, the Czech forces shirked from open battle and retired into the deep forests to launch guerilla attacks. After forty days the emperor had to withdraw his forces for the lack of supplies. When the Frankish forces returned the next year burning and plundering the Bohemian lands, the local tribes finally had to submit and became dependent on the Carolingian Empire.

===Great Moravia===

While the Frankish realm disintegrated in the mid-9th century, Bohemia fell under the influence of the Great Moravian state which was established around 830. In 874, the Mojmir duke Svatopluk I reached an agreement with the East Frankish king Louis the German and confirmed his Bohemian dominion. With the fragmentation of Great Moravia under the pressure of the Magyar incursions around 900, Bohemia began to form as an independent principality. Already in 880, the Přemyslid prince Bořivoj from Levý Hradec, initially a deputy of Duke Svatopluk I who had been baptised by the Great Moravian archbishop Methodius of Salonica in 874, moved his residence to Prague Castle and started to subjugate the Vltava Basin.

Great Moravia briefly regained control over the emerging Bohemian principality upon Bořivoj&#x27;s death in 888/890 until, in 895, his son Spytihněv together with the Slavník prince Witizla swore allegiance to the East Frankish king Arnulf of Carinthia in Regensburg. He and his younger brother Vratislaus then ruled over Central Bohemia around Prague. They were able to protect their realm from the Magyar forces which crushed an East Frankish army in the 907 Battle of Pressburg during the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin. Cut off from Byzantium by the Hungarian presence, the Bohemian principality existed as independent state though still in the shadow of East Francia; the dukes paid tribute to the Bavarian dukes in exchange for the confirmation of the peace treaty. Vratislaus&#x27; son Wenceslaus, who ruled from 921, was already accepted as head of the Bohemian tribal union; however, he had to cope with the enmity of his neighbour Duke Arnulf of Bavaria and his mighty ally, the Saxon king Henry I of Germany. Wenceslaus maintained his ducal authority by submitting to King Henry in 929, whereafter he was murdered by his brother Boleslaus.
Assuming the Bohemian throne in 935, Duke Boleslaus conquered the adjacent lands of Moravia and Silesia, and expanded farther to Kraków in the east. He offered opposition to Henry&#x27;s successor King Otto I, stopped paying the tribute, attacked an ally of the Saxons in northwest Bohemia and in 936 moved into Thuringia. After a prolonged armed conflict, King Otto I besieged a castle owned by Boleslaus&#x27; son in 950 and Boleslaus finally signed a peace treaty whereby he recognized Otto&#x27;s suzerainty and promised to resume the payment of the tribute. As the king&#x27;s ally, his Bohemian troops, together with those of the Kingdom of Germany, fought in the 955 Battle of Lechfeld and after the defeat of the Magyars received the lands of Moravia in recognition of his services.

Overwhelming the marauding Hungarians had the same benefits for Germans and Czechs. Less obvious is what Boleslav I the Cruel wanted to gain by participating in the war against the Obotrite tribes in far north, when he crushed an uprising of two Slavic dukes (Stojgněv and Nakon) in the Saxon Billung March. Probably Boleslav wanted to ensure that his German neighbors did not interfere with his expansion of Bohemia to the east.

Significantly, the Bishopric of Prague, founded in 973 during the reign of Duke Boleslaus II, was subordinated to the Archbishopric of Mainz. Thus, at the same time that Přemyslid rulers used the German alliance to consolidate their rule against a perpetually rebellious regional nobility, they struggled to retain their autonomy in relation to the empire. The Bohemian principality was definitively consolidated in 995, when the Přemyslids defeated their Slavník rivals, unified the Czech tribes, and established a form of centralized rule, albeit shaken by internal dynastic struggles.

===Holy Roman Empire===

In 1002, Duke Vladivoj was enfeoffed with the Duchy of Bohemia from the hands of King Henry II of Germany. With this act, what had been a fully sovereign duchy became part of the Holy Roman Empire. After Vladivoj died the next year, the Polish duke Bolesław I the Brave invaded Bohemia and Moravia and ruled as Boleslaus IV. In 1004, after the Poles were expelled from Bohemia with help from Henry II, Duke Jaromír received the duchy in fief from the king.

Duke Bretislaus I of Bohemia re-acquired the Moravian lands in 1019 or 1029, which thenceforth were usually ruled by a younger son of the Bohemian duke/king. About 1031, Bretislaus invaded Hungary to prevent its future expansion and, in 1035, he helped the Emperor against the Lusatians. In 1039, he invaded Poland, captured Poznań and ravaged Gniezno; after that he conquered part of Silesia including Breslau. The destruction of Gniezno pushed the Polish rulers to move their capital to Kraków. In 1040, Bretislaus defeated the German King Henry&#x27;s invasion into Bohemia in the Battle at Brůdek. However, the next year Henry besieged Bretislaus in Prague and forced him to renounce all of his conquests except Moravia. In 1047, Henry negotiated a peace treaty between Bretislaus and the Poles.

The son of Bretislaus, Vratislaus II, supported Henry against the Pope, anti-kings, and rebellions in Saxony in his long reign. The Bohemian troops showed conspicuous bravery and, in 1083, he entered Rome with Henry and their armed forces. Henry gave Vratislaus a lifetime appointment as the first King of Bohemia in 1085 out of gratitude. For his successor Bretislaus II foreign policy was largely concerned with the Silesian conflict, when the Poles did not pay a fee for areas once resigned by Bretislaus I.

In 1147, the Bohemian duke, Vladislaus II, accompanied the German king, Conrad III, on the Second Crusade, but halted his march at Constantinople. Thanks to his military support against northern Italian cities (especially Milan) for the emperor Frederick Barbarossa, Vladislaus was elected king of Bohemia on 11 January 1158, becoming the second Bohemian king.

==Economy==
The Duchy earned a significant income from the Prague slave trade, trafficking Pagan Slavs, termed as saqaliba, to slavery in al-Andalus in the 10th and 11th centuries.

Mining of tin and silver began in the Ore mountains in the early 12th century.

==Kingdom of Bohemia==
During the German civil war between the Hohenstaufen king Philip of Swabia and his Welf rival Otto IV, Duke Ottokar I of Bohemia decided to support Philip, for which he was awarded with a royal coronation in 1198, this time as a hereditary title. In 1200, however, Ottokar abandoned his pact with Philip and declared for the Welf faction. Both Otto and Pope Innocent III subsequently accepted Ottokar as hereditary King of Bohemia. The Bohemian principality was then reborn into the Bohemian kingdom.

In 1212, Ottokar I, bearing the title &quot;king&quot; since 1198, extracted the Golden Bull of Sicily—a formal edict by the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II confirming the royal title for Ottokar and his descendants, whereby his duchy was formally raised to a kingdom. The Bohemian king would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. The imperial prerogative to ratify each Bohemian ruler and to appoint the Bishop of Prague was revoked. The country then reached its greatest territorial extent and is considered its Golden Age.

After the extinction of the Přemyslid dynasty, the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were ruled by the House of Luxembourg from 1310, until the death of Emperor Sigismund in 1437. After the Middle Ages, the Kingdom of Bohemia remained under the rule of the Austrian House of Habsburg from 1526 until the collapse of Austria-Hungary after the First World War.

<text>Although the Kingdom of Bohemia, both of the Lusatias, the Margraviate of Moravia, and Silesia were all under Habsburg rule, they followed different paths of development. Moravians and Silesians had accepted the hereditary right of the Austrian Habsburgs to rule and thus escaped the intense struggle between native estates and the Habsburg monarchy that was to characterize Bohemian history. In contrast, the Bohemian Kingdom had entrenched estates that were ready to defend what they considered their rights and liberties. The Habsburgs pursued a policy of centralization and conflict arose, which was further complicated by ethnic and religious issues.

==History of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1526–1648)==
===Initial clashes (16th century)===

Habsburg rule brought two centuries of conflict between the Bohemian estates and the monarchy. As a result of this struggle, the Czechs lost a major portion of their native aristocracy, their particular form of religion (Hussitism), and even the widespread use of the Czech language. The Habsburg policy of centralization began with its first ruler, King Ferdinand (1526–64). His efforts to eliminate the influence of the Bohemian estates were met with resistance. But the Bohemian estates were themselves divided, primarily on religious lines. By several adroit political maneuvers, Ferdinand was able to establish hereditary succession to the Bohemian crown for the Habsburgs. The estates&#x27; inability to establish the principle of electing or even confirming a monarch made their position considerably weaker. 

The conflict in Bohemia was complicated further by the Reformation and the subsequent wars of religion in Central Europe. Adherents of the Czech Reformed Church (Hussites) opposed the Roman Catholic Habsburgs, who were in turn supported by the Czech and German Catholics. The Lutheran Reformation of 1517 introduced an added dimension to the struggle: much of the German burgher population of Bohemia adopted one of the new Protestant creeds (both Lutheran and Calvinist); the Hussites split, and one faction allied with the German Protestants. In 1537, Ferdinand conceded to the Czechs, recognized the Compacts of Basel, and accepted moderate Utraquism. The reconciliation, however, was of brief duration. 

In 1546 German Protestants united in the Schmalkaldic League to wage war against the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V. Whereas Ferdinand wanted to aid his brother, the Hussite and pro-Protestant Czech nobility sympathized with the German Protestant princes. Armed conflict between Ferdinand and the Bohemian estates broke out in 1547. But the Bohemians were not unified; victory went to Ferdinand, and reprisals against the Czech rebels followed. The property of Czech Utraquist nobility was confiscated and their privileges abrogated. Four rebels (two lesser nobles and two burghers) were executed in the square before the royal palace. Members of the Unity of the Brethren, a Hussite church that had figured prominently in the rebellion, were bitterly persecuted. Their leader, Bishop Jan Augusta, was sentenced to sixteen years&#x27; imprisonment. Ferdinand, now Holy Roman Emperor (1556–64), attempted to extend the influence of Catholicism in Bohemia by forming the Jesuit Academy in Prague and by bringing Jesuit missionaries into Bohemia.

From 1599 to 1711, Moravia (a Land of the Bohemian Crown) was frequently subjected to raids by the Ottoman Empire and its vassals (especially the Tatars and Transylvania). Overall, hundreds of thousands were enslaved whilst tens of thousands were killed.

===Battle of White Mountain===
Discord between Habsburgs and Czechs and between Catholics and the followers of the reformed creeds erupted again into an open clash in the early seventeenth century. At that time, the Czechs were able to take advantage of the struggle between two contenders to the imperial throne, and in 1609 they extracted a Letter of Majesty from Emperor Rudolf II (1576–1612) that promised toleration of the Czech Reformed Church, gave control of Charles University to the Czech estates, and made other concessions. Rudolf&#x27;s successor, Matthias (1612–17), proved to be an ardent Catholic and quickly moved against the estates. Violation of promises contained in the Letter of Majesty regarding royal and church domains and Matthias&#x27;s reliance on a council composed of ardent Catholics further increased tensions. 

In 1618 two Catholic imperial councillors were thrown out of a window of Prague Castle (one of the so-called Defenestrations of Prague), signaling an open revolt by the Bohemian estates against the Habsburgs and started the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The Bohemian estates decided to levy an army, decreed the expulsion of the Jesuits, and proclaimed the Bohemian throne to be elective. They elected a Calvinist, Frederick of the Palatinate, to the Bohemian throne. Frederick then tried to muster further support for the Bohemian cause, even attempting to convince the Ottoman Empire to provide military support in exchange for tribute. On November 8, 1620, the Czech estates confronted the imperial forces in the Battle of White Mountain near Prague and were decisively defeated.

===Consequences of the defeat (1620–1648)===
The Czech defeat at the Battle of White Mountain was followed by measures that effectively secured Habsburg authority and the dominance of the Roman Catholic Church. Many Czech nobles were executed; most others were forced to flee the kingdom. An estimated five-sixths of the Czech nobility went into exile soon after the Battle of White Mountain, and their properties were confiscated. Large numbers of Czech and German Protestant burghers emigrated. In 1622, Charles University was merged with the Jesuit Academy, and the entire education system of the Bohemian Kingdom was placed under Jesuit control. In 1624 all non-Catholic priests were expelled by royal decree. 

The Revised Ordinance of the Land (1627) established a legal basis for Habsburg absolutism. All Czech lands were declared hereditary property of the Habsburg family. The German language was made equal to the Czech language. The legislative function of the diets of both Bohemia and Moravia was revoked; all subsequent legislation was to be by royal decree, receiving only formal approval from the diets. The highest officials of the kingdom, to be chosen from among the local nobility, would be strictly subordinate to the king. Thus, little remained of an autonomous and distinct Bohemian Kingdom. 

Habsburg rule was further buttressed by the large-scale immigration into Bohemia of Catholic Germans from south German territories. The Germans received most of the land confiscated from Czech owners and came to constitute the new Bohemian nobility. The remaining Czech Catholic nobles gradually abandoned Czech particularism and became loyal servants of the imperial system. German Catholic immigrants took over commerce and industry as well. 

The religious wars continued after the Czech defeat. The Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–48) of the German Protestant princes against the Holy Roman Emperor involved foreign powers and extended beyond German territory. Czechs fought on all sides: most of the rebellious Czech generals joined Protestant armies; Albrecht of Wallenstein was the most prominent Czech defector to the imperial cause. Bohemia served as a battlefield throughout the war. Prince Bethlen Gabor&#x27;s Hungarian forces, reinforced by Turkish mercenaries, fought against the emperor and periodically devastated Slovakia and Moravia. Protestant German armies and, later, Danish and Swedish armies, laid waste the Czech provinces. Cities, villages, and castle fortresses were destroyed. Lusatia was incorporated into Saxony in 1635. 

In 1648 the Treaty of Westphalia confirmed the incorporation of the Bohemian Kingdom into the Habsburg imperial system, which established its seat in Vienna. The Bohemian Kingdom &quot;de facto&quot; lost its independence (&quot;de jure&quot; only under Maria Theresa).

==Legacy==

Czechs call the following period, from 1620/1648 till the late 18th century, the &quot;Dark Age&quot;. It is characterized by devastation by foreign troops; Germanization; and economic and political decline. The struggle between the Bohemian estates and Habsburg absolutism resulted in the complete subordination of the Bohemian estates to Habsburg interests. In the aftermath of the defeat at White Mountain, the Czechs lost their native noble class, their reformed religion, and a vibrant Czech Protestant culture. The German language became more prominent in government and polite society. 

The Kingdom of Bohemia became little more than a province of the Habsburg realm.

After the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618 and 1648), from the original 2.6 million inhabitants of Bohemia and Moravia, there remained approximately 950,000 inhabitants in Bohemia and only 600,000 inhabitants in Moravia.

<text>The Czech lands, then also known as Lands of the Bohemian Crown, were largely subject to the Habsburgs from the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1648 until the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. There were invasions by the Turks early in the period, and by the Prussians in the next century. The Habsburgs consolidated their rule and under Maria Theresa (1740–1780) adopted enlightened absolutism, with distinct institutions of the Bohemian Kingdom absorbed into centralized structures. After the Napoleonic Wars and the establishment of the Austrian Empire, a Czech National Revival began as a scholarly trend among educated Czechs, led by figures such as František Palacký. Czech nationalism took a more politically active form during the 1848 revolution, and began to come into conflict not only with the Habsburgs but with emerging German nationalism.

== The Dark Age (1648–1740) ==
After the Thirty Years&#x27; War ended, the Czech lands definitively passed onto the Habsburgs who eradicated Protestant Hussitism in the 1620s and upheld the strict Counter-Reformation measures. Hence the name Dark Age for this period.

From 1599 to 1711, Moravia (a Land of the Bohemian Crown) was frequently subjected to raids by the Ottoman Empire and its vassals (especially the Tatars and Transylvania). Overall, hundreds of thousands were enslaved whilst tens of thousands were killed. In 1664 Habsburg armies under command of Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches attacked the Ottomans, conquered Nitra and Levice and freed some of the captive Moravians. When general Montecuccoli&#x27;s army won the Battle of Saint Gotthard, the Turks signed Peace of Vasvár, which would last 20 years.

In 1683, Leopold I (1656–1705) defeated the Turks and paved the way for the restoration of the Kingdom of Hungary to its previous territorial dimensions. The brief reign of Joseph I (1705–1711) was followed by that of Charles VI (1711–1740). Between 1720 and 1725, Charles concluded a series of treaties by which the various estates of the Habsburg lands recognized the unity of the territory under Habsburg rule and accepted hereditary Habsburg succession, including the female line.

== Enlightened absolutism (1740–1815) ==
The reigns of Maria Theresa (1740–1780) and her son Joseph II (1780–1790), Holy Roman Emperor and coregent from 1765, were characterized by enlightened rule. Influenced by the ideas of eighteenth-century Enlightenment philosophers, Maria-Theresa and Joseph worked toward rational and efficient administration of the Bohemian Kingdom. In this respect, they opposed regional privilege and the rights of the estates and preferred to rule through a centrally controlled imperial bureaucracy. At the same time, they instituted reforms to eliminate the repressive features of the Counter-Reformation and to permit secular social progress.

Maria-Theresa&#x27;s accession to the Habsburg lands was challenged by the territorial aspirations of the increasingly powerful Hohenzollern dynasty. The Prussian king, Frederick II, joined by the dukes of Bavaria and Saxony, invaded the Bohemian Kingdom in 1740 in the First Silesian War. The Duke of Bavaria, Charles Albert, was proclaimed king by the Czech nobility. Although Maria-Theresa regained most of the Bohemian Kingdom and was crowned queen in Prague in 1743, all of the highly industrialized territory of Silesia except for Tesin, Opava, and Krnov was ceded to Prussia in the 1742 Treaty of Breslau.

In attempting to make administration more rational, Maria-Theresa embarked on a policy of centralization and bureaucratization. What remained of the Bohemian Kingdom was now merged into the Austrian provinces of the Habsburg realm. The two separate chancelleries were abolished and replaced by a joint Austro-Bohemian chancellery. The Czech estates were stripped of the last remnants of their political power, and their functions were assumed by imperial civil servants appointed by the queen. The provinces of the Czech and Austrian territories were subdivided into administrative districts. German became the official language.

Great famine in 1770–1771 caused deaths of one tenth of the country&#x27;s population.

Further reforms introduced by Maria-Theresa and Joseph II reflected such Enlightenment principles as the dissolution of feudal social structures and the curtailment of power of the Catholic Church. Maria-Theresa nationalized and Germanized the education system, eliminated Jesuit control, and shifted educational emphasis from theology to the sciences. Serfdom was first modified by Maria-Theresa -- &quot;robota&quot; (forced labor on the lord&#x27;s land) was reduced, and serfs could marry and change domiciles without the lord&#x27;s consent—then abolished altogether by Joseph II. In 1781, Joseph&#x27;s Patent of Toleration extended freedom of worship to Lutherans and Calvinists.

The enlightened rule of Maria-Theresa and Joseph II played a leading role in the development of a modern Czech nation, but one that was full of contradictions. On the one hand, the policy of centralization whittled down further any vestiges of a separate Bohemian Kingdom and resulted in the Germanization of the imperial administration and nobility. On the other hand, by removing the worst features of the Counter-Reformation and by introducing social and education reforms, these rulers provided the basis for economic progress and the opportunity for social mobility. The consequences for Bohemia were manifold. Many of the nobles sublet their lands and invested their profits in industrial enterprise, such as the development of textile, coal, and glass manufacture. Czech peasants, now free to leave the land, moved to cities and manufacturing centers. Urban areas, formerly populated by Germans, became increasingly Czech in character. The sons of Czech peasants were sent to school; some attended the university, and a new Czech intellectual elite emerged. During this same period the population of Bohemia nearly quadrupled, and a similar increase occurred in Moravia.

But in response to pressures from the nobility, Joseph&#x27;s successor, Leopold II (1790–1792), abrogated many of Joseph&#x27;s edicts and restored certain feudal obligations. (Serfdom was not completely abolished until 1848.) Under Francis II (1792–1835), the aristocratic and clerical reaction gathered strength. The war against revolutionary France and the subsequent Napoleonic wars caused a temporary interruption of the reactionary movement. In 1804, Francis II transferred his imperial title to the Austrian domains (Austria, Bohemian Kingdom, Hungary, Galicia, and parts of Italy), and two years later the Holy Roman Empire was formally dissolved. The Austrian Empire came into existence and was to play a leading role in the newly established German Confederation. From 1815, after the conclusive defeat of Napoleon, the policy of reaction devised by Austria&#x27;s foreign minister, Prince Metternich, dominated European affairs.

Enlightened rule destroyed the few remaining vestiges of the Bohemian Kingdom. The dismantling of Bohemian institutions and the dominance of the German language seemed to threaten the very existence of the Czech nation. Yet, enlightened rule also provided new educational and economic opportunities for the Czech people. Inadvertently, the enlightened monarchs helped set the stage for a Czech national revival.

== Czech National Revival ==

The first half of the nineteenth century was a period of nationalistic awakening in Central Europe. German nationalism — sparked by confrontation with the armies of the French revolutionaries — and Napoleonic expansionism inspired corresponding efforts toward national revival among the subject Slavic peoples. The concept of the &quot;nation,&quot; defined as a people united by linguistic and cultural affinities, produced an intellectual revival that laid the foundation for a subsequent struggle for political autonomy.

In Bohemia, where the nobility was largely German or Germanized, the leaders of the Czech revival were members of the new intelligentsia, which had its origin in peasant stock. Only a small part of the nobility lent the revival support.

The earliest phase of the national movement was philological. Scholars attempted to record and codify native languages. A chair for Czech language and literature was established at Charles-Ferdinand University in 1791. The Czech language, however, had survived only as a regional language among the peasants. Officially German language still remained equal to the Czech language in Czech lands from 1627 until 1918. The tasks of molding the Czech language into a literary language and introducing the study of Czech in state schools were accomplished by Josef Dobrovský and Josef Jungmann. Their efforts were rewarded by an efflorescence of Czech literature and the growth of a Czech reading public. Prominent among the original Czech literary elite were poets Ján Kollár (a Slovak), František Čelakovský, Karel Jaromír Erben, and Karel Hynek Mácha; dramatists Václav Kliment Klicpera and Josef Kajetán Tyl; and journalist-politicians F.A. Brauner and Karel Havlíček Borovský.

The Czech revival acquired an institutional foundation with the establishment of the Museum of the Bohemian Kingdom (1818) as a center for Czech scholarship. In 1827 the museum began publication of a journal that became the first continuous voice of Czech nationalism. In 1830 the museum absorbed the &quot;Matice česká&quot;, a society of Czech intellectuals devoted to the publication of scholarly and popular books. The museum membership, composed of patriotic scholars and nobles, worked to establish contacts with other Slavic peoples and to make Prague the intellectual and scholarly capital of the Slavs.

The major figure of the Czech revival was František Palacký. Of Moravian Protestant descent and attracted by the nationalist spirit of the Hussite tradition, Palacký became the great historian of the Czech nation. His monumental, five-volume History of the Czech People focused on the struggle of the Czech nation for political freedom and became one of the pillars of modern Czech life and thought. Palacky — who fancied himself the heir and successor to the great educator and leader of the Unity of Czech Brethren, Jan Amos Komenský (Comenius) - became the political leader of the Czech nation during the revolutionary struggles of 1848. In the tradition of Komenský, Palacký developed a political platform based on cultural renaissance.

== The 1848 Revolution ==

The French Revolution of 1848 precipitated a succession of liberal and national revolts against autocratic governments. Revolutionary disturbances pervaded the territories of the Austrian Empire, and Emperor Ferdinand I (1835–1848) promised to reorganize the empire on a constitutional, parliamentary basis.

In the Bohemian Kingdom, a national committee was formed that included Germans and Czechs. But Bohemian Germans favored creating a Greater Germany out of various German-speaking territories. The Bohemian Germans soon withdrew from the committee, signaling the Czech-German conflict that would characterize subsequent history. Palacky proposed Austro-Slavism as the creed of the Czech national movement. He advocated the preservation of the Austrian Empire as a buffer against both German and Russian expansionism. He also proposed the federalization of the empire on an ethnographic basis to unite the Bohemian Germans with Austria in one province and Czechs and Slovaks in another. Palacky further suggested that the various Slavic peoples of the empire, together constituting a majority, should form a political unit to defend their common interests. In June 1848, the Czechs convened the first Slavic Congress to discuss the possibility of political consolidation of Austrian Slavs, including Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Ruthenians (Ukrainians), Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs.

National revival for the Czechs had been begun by small groups of intellectuals. At first, the national movements were confined to discussion of language, literature, and culture. But during the revolutions of 1848, the Czechs made bold political demands. The revolutions of 1848 also revealed that the German liberals, who were opposed to Habsburg absolutism, were equally hostile to Czech national aspirations. It had become clear that the Czech national movements had to contend not only with Habsburg absolutism but also with increasingly virulent German nationalism.

In the end, the 1848 Revolution was crushed by the Austrian imperial forces, aided by a Russian military intervention to restore the Habsburg monarchy on the Danube. The Empire had turned into a military dictatorship in order to preserve itself, and prevent any parts of it from seceding. 

== Austrian military dictatorship (1848–1867) ==

After the revolutions of 1848, Franz Joseph attempted to rule as an absolute monarch, keeping all the nationalities in check. The transformation to a military regime with large-scale occupation forces in formerly revolutionary areas came at a high price of massive debt, intern socioeconomic instability and external political and military weakening. The strenuous efforts to keep the post-crisis realm together limited its ability to project power abroad, such as during the Crimean War.

Next, the Habsburgs suffered a series of military defeats. In 1859, they were driven out of Italy after defeat at the Battle of Solferino, and in 1866, they were defeated by Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War and expelled from the German Confederation. To reinforce his position amid yet another major crisis, Franz Joseph was ready to improve his relations with the Hungarians. At first it seemed that some concessions would be made to Bohemia, and that the state would become a tripartite federal monarchy with a German Austrian, Czech and Slovak, and Hungarian division. But in the end the crown effected a compromise with the Hungarian gentry in 1867. Proposals to grant the Bohemian Crown similar far-reaching autonomy finally fell through when the Fundamental Articles of 1871 were rejected.

<text>Quasimodo (from Quasimodo Sunday) is one of the main characters of the French novel &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; (1831) by Victor Hugo. Born with numerous deformities, most notably a hunched back, Quasimodo serves as the bell-ringer for Notre Dame cathedral in fifteenth century Paris. Although his appearance causes others to treat him cruelly, he ultimately finds sanctuary in an unlikely love that is fulfilled only in death.

The role of Quasimodo has been played by many actors in film adaptations, including Lon Chaney (1923), Charles Laughton (1939), Anthony Quinn (1956), and Anthony Hopkins (1982). In addition, he was voiced by Tom Hulce in an Disney animated feature (1996); was parodied by Steve Lemme in the comedy &quot;Quasi&quot; (2023); and most recently was portrayed by Angelo Del Vecchio in a revival of the French-language musical &quot;Notre Dame de Paris&quot;.

In 2010, a British researcher found evidence suggesting there was a real-life hunchbacked stone carver who worked at Notre Dame during the same period Victor Hugo was writing the novel and they may have even known each other.

==In the novel==
The deformed Quasimodo is described as &quot;hideous&quot; and a &quot;creation of the devil&quot;. He was born with a severe hunchback, a bushy eyebrow covering his left eye while the right eye &quot;disappeared entirely&quot; behind a giant wart, and broken teeth, one of which protruded over his mouth. He was born to a tribe of Romani people (in the novel called &quot;égyptienne&quot; or &#x27;gypsies&#x27;), but due to his monstrous appearance he was switched during infancy with an able-bodied baby girl, Agnes. One character in the novel refers to him as animalistic and un-Christian, suggesting he may be the &quot;offspring of a Jew and a sow&quot;, and thus deserving of death. After being discovered, Quasimodo is exorcised by Agnes&#x27;s mother (who believed that the Romani people ate her child) and taken to Paris. He is found abandoned in Notre Dame (on the foundlings&#x27; bed, where orphans and unwanted children are left to public charity) on Quasimodo Sunday, the First Sunday after Easter, by Claude Frollo, the Archdeacon of Notre Dame, who adopts the baby, names him after the day the baby was found, and brings him up to be the bell-ringer of the cathedral. Due to the loud ringing of the bells, Quasimodo also becomes deaf causing Frollo to teach him sign language. Although he is hated for his deformity, it is revealed that he is kind at heart. Though Quasimodo commits acts of violence in the novel, these are only undertaken when he is instructed by others.
Looked upon by the general populace of Paris as a monster, he believes that Frollo is the only one who cares for him, and frequently accompanies him when the Archdeacon walks out of Notre Dame. Frollo lusts after a beautiful Romani girl named Esmeralda, and enlists Quasimodo in trying to kidnap her. (She is later revealed to be Agnes, the baby Quasimodo was switched with.) Captain Phoebus de Châteaupers arrives to stop the kidnapping and captures Quasimodo, unaware that Quasimodo was merely following Frollo&#x27;s orders. The deaf judge Florian Barbedienne sentences him to an hour of flogging and another hour of humiliation on the pillory. Phoebus ties Quasimodo up and has Pierre Torterue whip him in front of a jeering crowd. When Quasimodo calls to him for help, Frollo allows Quasimodo to be tortured as punishment for failing him. When Quasimodo calls for water, a child throws a wet rag at him. Seeing his thirst, Esmeralda approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him and she captures his heart.

Esmeralda is later entangled in an attempted murder – committed by Frollo, who had stabbed Phoebus in a jealous rage after spying on Esmeralda and Phoebus having a night of passion – and is sentenced to be hanged. As she is being forced to pray at the steps of Notre Dame just before being marched off to the gallows, Quasimodo, who has been watching the occasion from an upper balcony in Notre Dame, slides down with a rope, and rescues her by taking her up to the top of the cathedral, where he poignantly shouts &quot;Sanctuary!&quot; to the onlookers below.

Esmeralda is terrified of Quasimodo at first, but gradually recognizes his kind heart and becomes his friend. He watches over her and protects her, and at one point saves her from Frollo when the mad priest sexually assaults her in her room. In one instance Esmeralda also sees Phoebus from the cathedral balcony and pleadingly convinces Quasimodo to go down and look for him, but Phoebus is repulsed by Quasimodo&#x27;s appearance and refuses to visit Notre Dame to see her.

After an uneasy respite, a mob of Paris&#x27;s Truands led by Clopin Trouillefou storms Notre Dame, and although Quasimodo tries to fend them off by throwing stones and bricks down onto the mob and even pours deadly molten lead, the mob continues attacking until Phoebus and his soldiers arrive to fight and drive off the assailants. Unbeknownst to Quasimodo, Frollo lures Esmeralda outside, where he has her arrested and hanged. When Quasimodo sees Frollo smiling cruelly at Esmeralda&#x27;s execution, he turns on his master and throws him to his death from the balcony in rage.

Quasimodo cries in despair, lamenting &quot;There is all that I ever loved!&quot; He then leaves Notre Dame, never to return, and heads for the Gibbet of Montfaucon beyond the city walls, passing by the Convent of the Filles-Dieu, a home for 200 reformed prostitutes, and the leper colony of Saint-Lazare. After reaching the Gibbet, he lies next to Esmeralda&#x27;s corpse, where it had been unceremoniously thrown after the execution. He stays at Montfaucon, and eventually dies of starvation, clutching the body of the deceased Esmeralda. Years later, an excavation group exhumes both of their skeletons, which have become intertwined. When they try to separate them, Quasimodo&#x27;s bones crumble to dust.

=== Symbolism ===
In the novel, Quasimodo symbolically shows Esmeralda the difference between himself and the handsome yet self-centered Captain Phoebus, with whom the girl has become infatuated. He places two vases in her room: one is a beautiful crystal vase, yet broken and filled with dry, withered flowers; the other a humble pot, yet filled with beautiful, fragrant flowers. Esmeralda takes the withered flowers from the crystal vase and presses them passionately on her heart.

==Adaptations==

Among the actors who have played Quasimodo over the years in each adaptation of the novel are:
=== Disney version ===
==== In the first film ====
In Disney&#x27;s 1996 animated film adaptation of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, Quasimodo is a very different character than in the novel. He was voiced by Tom Hulce and animated by James Baxter. Unlike in the novel, Quasimodo has two eyes, with his left one only partially covered. He is not deaf, and is capable of fluent speech. He has three anthropomorphic gargoyle friends named Victor, Hugo, and Laverne. The changes begin with how he became a ward of Claude Frollo; while in the novel, he is abandoned on the steps of Notre Dame, in the film that is where his mother is killed while protecting him.

In the beginning of the film, a Romani mother tries to bring the hunchbacked infant into Notre Dame with her for sanctuary, but the antizigan Judge Claude Frollo (Tony Jay) chases and inadvertently kills her. Frollo attempts to drown the baby in a nearby well upon seeing his deformity, but the church&#x27;s Archdeacon stops him and demands that he atone for his crime by raising the child as his son. Fearing God&#x27;s wrath, Frollo reluctantly agrees, and adopts the child in the hope that he will be useful to him one day. Frollo cruelly names the child Quasimodo, which in the film is Latin for &quot;half-formed&quot;. Over the years he raises Quasimodo with cruelty, forbidding him to leave the tower and teaching him that the world is a wicked, sinful place, and that the Parisian people will reject him due to his deformity. He also lies to Quasimodo about his mother, telling him she abandoned him as a baby and that anybody else would have drowned him had Frollo not stepped in and adopted him. Quasimodo nevertheless grows up to be a kind-hearted young man who yearns to join the outside world.

Quasimodo sneaks out of the cathedral during the Festival of Fools, where he is crowned the &quot;King of Fools&quot;. While there, he meets Esmeralda, with whom he falls in love. Two of Frollo&#x27;s guards ruin the moment by throwing tomatoes at him and binding him to a wheel to torment him, rousing a crowd of onlookers to join in. Frollo refuses to help as punishment for his disobedience. Esmeralda takes pity on him and frees him after Phoebus fails to get Frollo to intervene. After Esmeralda escapes, Frollo confronts Quasimodo, who apologizes and returns to the bell tower. He later befriends Esmeralda when she claims sanctuary from Frollo in the cathedral, and he helps her flee from Frollo&#x27;s men in gratitude. Though saddened to see that Esmeralda has romantic love for Captain Phoebus rather than himself, Quasimodo cares for her enough to learn to respect her choice.

Frollo eventually locates Esmeralda and Phoebus at the Court of Miracles. He sentences Esmeralda to death, and has Quasimodo chained up in the bell tower. Quasimodo breaks free, however, and rescues Esmeralda from execution. Phoebus breaks free from his cage and rallies the citizens of Paris against Frollo&#x27;s tyranny. From the bell tower, Quasimodo and the gargoyles watch the citizens fighting Frollo&#x27;s army. They pour molten lead onto the streets, preventing Frollo and his soldiers from breaking in. However, Frollo successfully manages to enter the cathedral. He tries to kill Quasimodo, who is mourning Esmeralda, believing her to be dead. The two struggle briefly until Quasimodo throws Frollo to the floor and denounces him, finally seeing him for what he is. Esmeralda awakens and Quasimodo rushes her to safety. He then fights the wrathful Frollo, who reveals the truth about his mother to him. Both fall from the balcony, but Phoebus catches Quasimodo and pulls him to safety, while Frollo falls to his death. Quasimodo is finally accepted into society by the citizens of Paris as they celebrate the liberation of the city from Frollo.

==== In the second film ====
In Disney&#x27;s 2002 direct-to-video sequel, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame II&quot;, Quasimodo (again voiced by Hulce) reappears, once again as the protagonist. He remains a bell-ringer, still living in Notre Dame with the gargoyles. This time, he is able to move around Paris freely. He finds love in a beautiful circus performer named Madellaine (voiced by Jennifer Love Hewitt), who ultimately reveals that she is aware that the gargoyles are alive. His love for Madellaine is briefly strained when he learns she was actually working on behalf of a greedy magician named Sarousch who plans to steal a particularly valuable bell called La Fidele, from Notre Dame. Madellaine&#x27;s true feelings for Quasimodo overcome her reluctant loyalty to Sarousch, however, and she aids Quasimodo in bringing Sarousch to justice. Quasimodo forgives Madellaine and the two pledge their love to each other.

==== Later appearances ====
* Quasimodo also made some occasional appearances on the animated series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. At one point, Jiminy Cricket, when giving advice to the guests, consoles him by saying that some people find someone special and some people do not, poking fun at the fact that Quasimodo and Esmeralda did not fall in love at the end of the original film.
* Quasimodo is a very rare meetable character at the Disney Parks and Resorts, but can be seen as a figure inside Clopin&#x27;s Music Box in Fantasyland.
* A German musical stage show &quot;Der Glöckner von Notre Dame&quot; (1999) derived from the Disney movie, restores some of the darker elements of the original novel lost in the film: Esmeralda dies from smoke inhalation at the end, Frollo is revealed to have once been a priest in his past (akin to the novel, where he was an archdeacon), and Frollo dies because Quasimodo throws him from the roof rather than falling by accident.
* Quasimodo appears in the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot; voiced by Ari Rubin. He appears as a supporting character in a world based on the film called &quot;La Cité des Cloches&quot; and plays out more or less the same role as in the film.
* In 2014 at the La Jolla Playhouse, Disney premiered a new adaptation of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. Like the 1999 German Adaptation, the new adaptation was based on movie but it restored some of the themes, characters, and ending of Hugo&#x27;s original book. It later transferred to PaperMill Playhouse in 2015, but was denied to transfer to a theater on Broadway. The musical also establishes Quasimodo as Frollo&#x27;s nephew - Jehan runs off with a Gypsy girl, Florika, after being expelled from Notre Dame&#x27;s sanctuary. Years later, Frollo receives a letter from him and finds him on his deathbed. It is revealed Florika had died from pox and Jehan eventually dies from it as well, entrusting his brother with his son even though he is an established Gypsy child.
* Quasimodo appears in the video game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot; as a playable character to unlock for limited time.
* Quasimodo appears in the 2023 live-action/animated short &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot; with Tom Hulce returning to voice him.

==Real-life Quasimodo==
In August 2010, Adrian Glew, a Tate archivist, announced evidence for a real-life Quasimodo, a &quot;humpbacked [stone] carver&quot; who worked at Notre Dame during the 1820s. The evidence is contained in the memoirs of Henry Sibson, a 19th-century British sculptor who worked at Notre Dame at around the same time Hugo wrote the novel. Sibson describes a humpbacked stonemason working there: &quot;He was the carver under the Government sculptor whose name I forget as I had no intercourse with him, all that I know is that he was humpbacked and he did not like to mix with carvers.&quot; Because Victor Hugo had close links with the restoration of the cathedral, it is likely that he was aware of the unnamed &quot;humpbacked carver&quot; nicknamed &quot;Le Bossu&quot; (French for &quot;The Hunchback&quot;), who oversaw &quot;Monsieur Trajin&quot;. Adrian Glew also uncovered that both the hunchback and Hugo were living in the same town of Saint Germain-des-Prés in 1833, and in early drafts of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, Hugo named the main character &quot;Jean Trajin&quot; (the same name as the unnamed hunchbacked carver&#x27;s employee), but later changed it to &quot;Jean Valjean&quot;.

<text>The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 established the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary (also known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire).

== Overview of political dynamics 1867–1918 ==
The two parts of the empire were united by a common ruler, by a joint foreign policy, and, to some extent, by shared finances. Otherwise, Austria and Hungary were virtually independent states, each having its own parliament, government, administration, and judicial system.

Despite a series of crises, this dual system survived until 1918. It made permanent the dominant positions of the Hungarians in Hungary and of the Germans in the Austrian parts of the monarchy. Although both halves of the empire had parliamentary systems, in the Austrian half a series of franchise reforms, culminating in universal manhood suffrage in 1907, allowed the Czechs to play an increasingly active role in the political life of Austria. In the last decades before 1914 a succession of governments included a number of non-German ministers and even one Polish Minister-President, but Austria&#x27;s Germans dominated political power at the imperial level until the end of the state.

At the local level, the various nationalities gained a great deal of control over provincial and municipal affairs after a series of reforms in local government in the 1860s and 1870s. The monarchy&#x27;s inability or unwillingness to come to terms with its nationalities problems weakened the parliamentary system at a time of escalating international crises.

== Negotiations on Bohemian autonomy (1867–1877) ==

In Austria, German liberals held political power in parliament from 1867 to 1879. They were determined to maintain German dominance in the Austrian part of the empire. The Czech leaders, subsequently labeled Old Czechs, favored alliance with the conservative and largely Germanized Bohemian nobility and advocated the restoration of traditional Bohemian autonomy. In essence, they wanted a reconstituted Bohemian Kingdom (including Moravia and Silesia) with a constitutional arrangement similar to Hungary&#x27;s. In 1871 the Old Czechs seemed to have succeeded, because the government agreed to the Fundamental Articles, which would have reinstated the historic rights of the Bohemian Kingdom. Violent protests from both German and Hungarian liberals ensued, however, and the articles were never adopted.

== History of Bohemia during the Old Czech era (1878–1891) ==
Objecting to an increase of Slavs in the empire, the German liberals opposed the 1878 Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The emperor, stung by the rejection of his foreign policy, dismissed the liberal government and turned to Count Eduard Taaffe&#x27;s conservative &quot;Iron Ring&quot; cabinet (1879–1883). The Taaffe government took the Slavic element into greater account than the liberals had, and in turn was supported by the Old Czechs. Czech cooperation with Taaffe led to several important gains. A language decree promulgated in 1880 put Czech on an equal footing with German in the Bohemian &quot;outer service&quot; (the language government officials spoke to the public) and law. This law applied to all 216 judicial districts of Bohemia including 77 judicial districts without any significant presence of Czech-speakers. In 1882 Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague was divided into two separate institutions: one Czech and the other German. These concessions, however, seemed insufficient to a newly developing Czech commercial and industrial bourgeoisie. Intense conflict ensued as Czechs and Germans attempted to control local administration and education. German Bohemians held that in the closed German-speaking part of Bohemia, only German should be an official language, and objected to the language regulations as being motivated by the Czech &quot;state rights&quot; ideology. When some of the Old Czechs attempted to work out a compromise with the Bohemian Germans in 1890, they were denounced by a younger and more radical intelligentsia. The next year the Old Czechs were soundly defeated by the Young Czechs, ending a period of attempted compromises.

== History of Moravia (1867–1918) ==

While relations between Czechs and Germans worsened in Bohemia, they remained relatively tranquil in Moravia. Although the separate administrative status of Moravia had been abolished in the 18th century, the area was reconstituted as a separate crown land in 1849. In Moravia, unlike in Bohemia, a compromise was reached by Karel Emanuel v. Zierotin, in 1905, between the Czech majority and the German minority. Although the German language retained a slight predominance, the preservation of Czech language and culture was legally guaranteed. The compromise seemed to work reasonably well until the end of Habsburg rule in 1918.

== Young Czech and Czech Progressive Party era (1891–1914) ==
During the final decade of the empire, obstructionism by both Czechs and Germans rendered parliamentary politics ineffectual, and governments rose and fell with great frequency. The importance of the Young Czech Party waned as Czech politics changed orientation. Political parties advocating democracy and socialism emerged. In 1900 Tomáš Masaryk, a university professor and former Young Czech deputy who was to become president of the Czechoslovak Republic, founded the Czech Progressive Party. Basing its struggle for national autonomy on the principle of popular sovereignty, the Czech Progressive Party supported parliamentary politics, advocated universal suffrage, and rejected radicalism.

At the turn of the century, the idea of a &quot;Czechoslovak&quot; entity began to be advocated by some Czech and Slovak leaders.

== World War I ==
In the first months of World War I, the response of the Czech soldiers and civilians to the war and mobilisation were highly enthusiastic; however later it turned into apathy.
The cause of Czech self-government was greatly advanced by the war, during which, in 1917, the Manifesto of Czech writers, signed by over two hundred leading Czechs, was published. This favoured the concept of Czech autonomy.

<text>Hans Talhoffer (Dalhover, Talhouer, Thalhoffer, Talhofer; – after 1482) was a German fencing master. His martial lineage is unknown, but his writings make it clear that he had some connection to the tradition of Johannes Liechtenauer, the grand master of a well-known Medieval German school of fencing. Talhoffer was a well-educated man who took interest in astrology, mathematics, onomastics, and the auctoritas and the ratio. He authored at least five fencing manuals during the course of his career, and appears to have made his living teaching, including training people for trial by combat.

== Life ==
The first known reference to Talhoffer is in 1433, when he represented Johann II von Reisberg, archbishop of Salzburg, before the Vehmic court. Shortly thereafter in 1434, Talhoffer was arrested and questioned by order of Wilhelm von Villach (a footman to Albrecht III von Wittelsbach, duke of Bavaria) in connection to the trial of a Nuremberg aristocrat named Jacob Auer, accused of murdering of his brother. Auer&#x27;s trial was quite controversial and proved a major source of contention and regional strife for the subsequent two years. Talhoffer himself remained in the service of the archbishop for at least a few more years, and in 1437 is mentioned as serving as a bursary officer (&quot;Kastner&quot;) in Hohenburg.

The 1440s saw the start of Talhoffer&#x27;s career as a professional fencing master. His first fencing manuscript, the Ms. Chart.A.558, was a personal reference book created in ca. 1443. The fencing manual portion is largely text-less and it may have been designed as a visual aid for use in teaching; in addition to these illustrations, it also contains an astrological treatise and a version of Konrad Kyeser&#x27;s famous war book Bellifortis. Most significant among the noble clients that Talhoffer served in this period was the Königsegg family of southern Germany, and some time between 1446 and 1459 he produced the Ms. XIX.17-3 for this family. This work depicts a judicial duel being fought by Luithold von Königsegg as well as the training that Talhoffer gave him in preparation, but it seems that this duel never actually took place.
Talhoffer&#x27;s name appears again in the records of the city of Zürich in 1454, where he was chartered to teach fencing in some capacity and to adjudicate judicial duels. The account notes that a fight broke out among his students and had to be settled in front of the city council, resulting in various fines. He seems to have passed through Emerkingen later in the 1450s, where he was contracted to train the brothers David and Buppellin vom Stain; he also produced the Ms. 78.A.15 for them, a significantly expanded version of the Königsegg manuscript.

In 1459, Talhoffer commissioned the Ms. Thott.290.2º, a new personal fencing manual along the same lines as his 1443 work but expanded with additional content and captioned throughout. He appears to have continued instructing throughout the 1460s, and in 1467 he produced his final manuscript, the Cod. icon. 394a, for another of his noble clients, Eberhardt I von Württemberg. This would be his most comprehensive work, and the count paid 10 Guilder as well as quantities of rye and oats for the finished work.

While only a few facts are known about Talhoffer&#x27;s life, this has not stopped authors from conjecture. The presence of the Lion of St. Mark in Talhoffer&#x27;s 1459 coat of arms (right) has given rise to speculation that he may have been an early member or even a founder of the Frankfurt-am-Main-based Marxbrüder fencing guild, though there is no record of their existence prior to 1474. Additionally, much has been made of the fact that Talhoffer&#x27;s name doesn&#x27;t appear in Paulus Kal&#x27;s list of members of the Society of Liechtenauer. While some have speculated that this indicates rivalry or ill-will between the two contemporaries, Kal&#x27;s list seems to be a memorial to masters who were already deceased, so it is more likely that Talhoffer was simply still alive in ca. 1470 (just three years after writing his final treatise).

== Works ==
Talhoffer&#x27;s writings exist in well over a dozen manuscripts created in the fifteenth through nineteenth centuries; they have also been published a number of times beginning in 1893, including translations into English and French. His writings cover a wide assortment of weapons, including the arming sword, buckler, crossbow, dagger, flail, longknife, longshield, longsword, mace, poleaxe, spear, and unarmed grappling, often both armored and unarmored, on horse and on foot, and in scenarios including tournaments, formal duels, and unequal encounters implying urban self-defense. Despite the obvious care and detail that went into the artwork, the manuscripts generally have only a few words captioning each page (and in many cases none at all).

There are four known archetype copies of Talhoffer&#x27;s works:

* The Ms.Chart.A.558 was probably created in 1443. The original currently rests in the holdings of the Universitäts- und Forschungsbibliothek Erfurt/Gotha in Gotha, Germany. This is the earliest of the four known archetypes and Hils speculates that it was created as a personal reference book. Aside from Talhoffer&#x27;s own work, this manuscript also contains Johannes Hartlieb&#x27;s and Johannes Liechtenauer&#x27;s .
* The Ms.XIX.17-3 was created some time between 1446 and the creation of the Thott manuscript in 1459. The original currently rests in the private collection of the Königsegg-Aulendorf family in Königseggwald, Germany. This manuscript may possibly have been commissioned by the very Luithold von Königsegg who is featured in several of Talhoffer&#x27;s works.
* The Ms.Thott.290.2º was created in 1459; it was scribed by Michel Rotwyler and illustrated by Clauss Pflieger. The original currently rests in the holdings of Det Kongelige Bibliotek in Copenhagen, Denmark. This manuscript was likely a reference book created for Talhoffer&#x27;s personal use, and is much more lavish than the 1443. Aside from his own teachings, this manuscript also includes Liechtenauer&#x27;s and Konrad Kyeser&#x27;s (&quot;Battle Force&quot;). On the final ten folia, the text is inverted and opening the book from the back reveals a brief treatise on a variety of esoteric subjects by Jud Ebreesch.
* The Fechtbuch von 1467 (Cod.icon. 394a) -- the &quot;Fight Book&quot; or Combat Manual of 1467 -- was created in 1467 on the commission of Count Eberhardt I von Württemberg. The original currently rests in the holdings of Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich, Germany. This is Talhoffer&#x27;s final work, as well as the only one to treat the topic of unarmored longsword at length.

<doc id="424984" wikidata="Q414528" url="?curid=424984" title="Academician">
<text>An academician is a full member of an artistic, literary, engineering, or scientific academy. In many countries, it is an honorific title used to denote a full member of an academy that has a strong influence on national scientific life. 

Accordingly, within systems such as the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, the title grants privileges and administrative responsibilities for funding allocation and research priorities.

==History==
Historically, the meaning for the title of &quot;Academician&quot; follows the traditions of the two most successful early scientific societies: either the Royal Society, where it was an honorary recognition by an independent body of peer reviewers and was meant to distinguish a person, while giving relatively little formal power, or the model of the French Academy of Sciences, which was much closer integrated with the government, provided with more state funding as an organization, and where the title of &quot;Academician&quot; implied in a lot more rights when it came to decision making.

==China==
Being an academician in China is a top honor and title granted only to the nation&#x27;s top scientists and engineers. Academicians are elected through either the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering.

==United Kingdom==
The British honours &quot;Fellow of the Royal Society&quot; (FRS) or Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences can be considered rough equivalents. Fellowship of the Academy of Social Sciences was known as the Award of Academician until July 2014. Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering in the UK are recognized as academicians and members include Nobel Prize winners and the nation&#x27;s top engineers and scientists. Recently, Nobel Prize winner Frances Arnold was elected to the Royal Academy of Engineering.

==United States==
In the United States of America, academicians are elected members of the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering. Members include many Nobel Prize, Turing Awards, and Fields Medalists.

==Sweden==
Sweden does not use the Academician concept, but membership in learned societies are noted in the Swedish State Calendar. The Swedish Royal Academies are independent organizations, founded on Royal command, that act to promote the arts, culture, and science in Sweden. The Swedish Academy and Academy of Sciences who are responsible for the selection of Nobel Prize laureates in Literature, Physics, Chemistry, and the Prize in Economic Sciences. Also included in the Royal Academies are scientific societies that were granted Royal Charters. There are a few esteemed Swedish learned societies that has not sought Royal command, including the Society of Sciences in Lund.

==Eastern Europe==
Academician may also be a functional title and denote a full member of the National Academy of Sciences in those countries where the academy has a strong influence on national scientific life, particularly countries that were part of, or influenced by, the Soviet Union. In such countries, academician is used as an honorific title (like &quot;Doctor&quot;, &quot;Professor&quot;, etc.) when addressing or speaking about someone. Countries where the term &quot;academician&quot; is used in this way include the Russian Federation, China, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Mongolia, North Macedonia, Romania, Turkey, Serbia, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Belorussia, Uzbekistan, and Estonia. 

However, since the reforms of late USSR dismantled the de facto monopoly of the state on forming academies, the creation of voluntary academies has been allowed. While some of the newly created academies did improve the relatively rigid structure, the prestige and meaning of the title has been substantially undermined; as the title of &quot;academician&quot; could be awarded by associations of pseudoscientists or organizations that use the title for the sole purpose of gaining money. Therefore, it became customary and almost compulsory to list which academy gave the title to assert its meaningfulness.

==Europe==
In Europe, academicians are elected by Pan-European academies, such as the European Academy of Sciences and Arts and the Academia Europaea. 

==Canada==
In Canada, fellowship of the Royal Society of Canada is a comparable honour.

==Finland==
In Finland, &quot;Academician&quot; (, ) is an honorary title and the President of the Republic nominates the Academicians. There can be 12 Finnish Academicians representing science and scholarly pursuits and eight Academicians representing fine arts and literature at the same time. The Academy of Finland is the state funding agency of Finnish science and letters, but it has no organizational connection to Finnish Academicians. The scientists and scholars funded by the Academy of Finland are called Academy Professors (, ) and Academy Research Fellows (, ). In addition to Academy of Finland, Finland has four independent national academies. Finnish academies are less recognized globally due to its lack of international exposure and use of English language.

==Taiwan==
In Taiwan, elected members of &quot;Academia Sinica&quot; are considered academicians.

==Corresponding member==

A related option of membership also exists in some countries — a &quot;Corresponding Member&quot; is a person who is eminent in respect of scientific results but cannot or does not wish to become a full academy member. 

One of the reasons for this may be that they live far from the academy and it is inconvenient to often travel to its headquarters. It is, for example, the case when the person is not a resident in the country which the academy belongs to. For communication, such a scientist uses &quot;correspondence&quot;. 

Another possible reason is that the charter or traditions of the academy do not admit election of a person to a full membership, unless they have been a corresponding member for a certain period and has demonstrated additional achievements within this period. Because of this, in the Russian Academy of Sciences a corresponding membership is a seen as a lower level of membership as compared to the academicians.

<doc id="424986" wikidata="Q103447" url="?curid=424986" title="Flag of the Bahamas">
<text>The national flag of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas consists of a black triangle situated at the hoist with three horizontal bands: aquamarine, gold and aquamarine. Adopted in 1973 to replace the British Blue Ensign defaced with the emblem of the Crown Colony of the Bahama Islands, it has been the flag of the Bahamas since the country gained independence that year. The design of the present flag incorporated the elements of various submissions made in a national contest for a new flag prior to independence.

==History==
The Bahamas became a crown colony of the United Kingdom within its colonial empire in 1717. Under colonial rule, the Bahama Islands used the British Blue Ensign and defaced it with the emblem of the territory. This was inspired by the ousting of the pirates, and consisted of a scene depicting a British ship chasing two pirate ships out at the high seas encircled by the motto &quot;Expulsis piratis restituta commercia&quot; (&quot;Pirates expelled, commerce restored&quot;). The emblem was designed in around 1850, but did not receive official approval until 1964.

The Bahama Islands were granted internal autonomy in 1964. After the 1972 elections, the territory started negotiations on independence. A search for a national flag began soon after, with a contest being held to determine the new design. Instead of choosing a single winning design, it was decided that the new flag was to be an amalgamation of the elements from various submissions. It was first hoisted at midnight on 10 July 1973, the day the Bahamas became an independent country. The new country also changed its name from the Bahama Islands to the Bahamas upon independence.

==Design==
The colours of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The gold alludes the shining sun – as well as other key land-based natural resources – while the aquamarine epitomises the water surrounding the country. The black symbolises the &quot;strength&quot;, &quot;vigour, and force&quot; of the Bahamian people, while the directed triangle evokes their &quot;enterprising and determined&quot; nature to cultivate the abundant natural resources on the land and in the sea.

==Legal issues==
The Bahamian flag is often used as a flag of convenience by foreign-owned merchant vessels. Under the Law on Merchant Shipping Act 1976 (amended in 1982), any domestic or foreign vessel – regardless of country of origin or place of registration – can be registered in the Bahamas &quot;without difficulty&quot;. Furthermore, the ship&#x27;s crew is not restricted by nationality and &quot;ordinary crew members&quot; have &quot;virtually no requirements for qualification&quot;. This lack of regulation has led to ships flying flags of convenience – like the Bahamas&#x27; flag – having a reputation of possessing a &quot;poor safety record&quot;. This came to light in November 2002, when the Greek oil tanker MV Prestige flying the flag of the Bahamas split into two and sank in the Atlantic Ocean off the north-western Spanish coast. This produced an oil slick of 60,000 tons of petroleum.

<doc id="424987" wikidata="Q216658" url="?curid=424987" title="Bushel">
<text>A bushel (abbreviation: bsh. or bu.) is an imperial and US customary unit of volume, based upon an earlier measure of dry capacity. The old bushel was used mostly for agricultural products, such as wheat: in modern usage, the volume is nominal, with bushels denoting a mass defined differently for each commodity.

The name &quot;bushel&quot; is also used to translate similar units in other measurement systems.

==Name==
The word &quot;bushel&quot; as originally used for a container itself, and later a unit of measurement. The name comes from the Old French &#x27; and &#x27;, meaning &quot;little box&quot;. It may further derive from Old French &quot;&quot;, thus meaning &quot;little butt&quot;.
== History ==
The bushel is an intermediate value between the pound and ton or tun that was introduced to England following the Norman Conquest. Norman statutes made the London bushel part of the legal measure of English wine, ale, and grains. The Assize of Bread and Ale credited to Henry III, , defined this bushel in terms of the wine gallon, while the Assize of Weights and Measures usually credited to Edward I or II defined the London bushel in terms of the larger corn gallon. In either case, a London bushel was reckoned to contain 64 pounds, 12 ounces, 20 pennyweight, and 32 grains.

These measures were based on the relatively light tower pound and were rarely used in Scotland, Ireland, or Wales during the Middle Ages. When the Tower system was abolished in the 16th century, the bushel was redefined as 56 avoirdupois pounds.
The imperial bushel established by the Weights and Measures Act 1824 described the bushel as the volume of 80 avoirdupois pounds of distilled water in air at or 8 imperial gallons. This is the bushel in some use in the United Kingdom. Thus, there is no distinction between liquid and dry measure in the imperial system. 
The Winchester bushel is the volume of a cylinder in diameter and high, which gives an irrational number, of approximately 2150.4202 cubic inches. The modern American or US bushel is rounded to exactly 2150.42 cubic inches, a difference of less than one part per ten million.

In English use, a bushel was a round willow basket with fixed dimensions, and its inside measurements were as follows - base diameter 12 inches, top diameter 18 inches, height 12 inches - thus giving a volume of 8595.4 cubic inches. A basket filled level to the top was a bushel. A basket filled to the top but overfilled to a height where it overflowed was considered to be a bushel and a peck, a generous measure (a similar concept to a baker&#x27;s dozen). Hence, the old song &quot; I love you, a bushel and a peck...&quot; meant &quot;I am overflowing with love for you&quot;.

Sometimes the basket was made 13 inches high, but with a ring of &quot;waling&quot; (a special willow weaving technique) to mark the 12 inches height: these baskets had a volume of 9311.68 cubic inches.

==Volume==


==Weight==

Bushels are now most often used as units of mass or weight rather than of volume. The bushels in which grains are bought and sold on commodity markets or at local grain elevators, and for reports of grain production, are all units of weight. This is done by assigning a standard weight to each commodity that is to be measured in bushels. These bushels depend on the commodities being measured, and on the moisture content of the commodity. Some of the more common ones are:

* Oats:
** US: 32 lb ()
** Canada: 34 lb ()
** UK: 38 lb ()
* Barley: 48 lb ()
* Malted barley: 34 lb ()
* Shelled maize (corn) at 15.5% moisture by weight: 56 lb ()
* Wheat at 13.5% moisture by weight: 60 lb ()
* Soybeans at 13% moisture by weight: 60 lb ()

Other specific values are defined (and those definitions may vary within different jurisdictions, including from state to state in the United States) for other grains, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables, coal, hair and many other commodities.

Government policy in the United States is to phase out units such as the bushel and replace them with metric mass equivalents.

==Other units==

The German bushel is the &quot;. A Prussian scheffel was equal to 54.96 litres.
The Polish bushel (&#x27;) was used as measure of dry capacity. It is divided into 4 quarters (&#x27;) and in the early 19th century had a value of 128 litres in Warsaw and 501.116 litres in Kraków.
The Spanish bushel (&quot;) was used as a measure of dry capacity. It is roughly equal to 55.5 litres in Castille.

The Welsh hobbit was equivalent to two-and-a-half bushels when used for volume; when used for measuring weight the hobbit was dependent on the grain being weighed.

<doc id="424990" wikidata="Q7739677" url="?curid=424990" title="The Hill, St. Louis">
<text>The Hill is a neighborhood in St. Louis, Missouri, located on high ground south of Forest Park. The official boundaries of the neighborhood are Manchester Avenue (Route 100) on the north, Columbia and Southwest Avenues on the south, South Kingshighway Boulevard on the east, and Hampton Avenue on the west.

The Hill began with immigrants from Northern Italy, Germany, Ireland, and African-Americans who wanted to live near the railroad which connected the neighborhood to downtown. The vast numbers of northern Italians migrating to the area resulted in an Italian American majority population during the early part of the 20th century. Historically, it is a predominantly blue collar neighborhood.

Its name is due to its proximity to the highest point of the city, formerly named St. Louis Hill, which is outside the neighborhood&#x27;s boundaries, a few blocks south, at the intersection of Arsenal Street and Sublette Avenue. The intersection borders Sublette Park, the former site of the Social Evil Hospital, where Josephine Baker was born. Adjacent to the park is the former St. Louis County Insane Asylum, which opened in 1869 and is now the St. Louis Psychiatric Rehabilitation Center.

==History==
Various ethnic groups existed in the area in the mid-19th century. Italians, mainly from the north and especially from the northern Italian region of Lombardy, immigrated and settled in the area starting in the late 19th century, attracted by jobs in nearby plants established to exploit deposits of clay discovered by Irish immigrants in the 1830s.
Due to the increasing number of Italian speakers, the parish of St. Ambrose was founded by members of St. Aloysius Gonzaga Parish in what later came to be known as the Hill in 1903 to serve primarily the recent Lombard immigrants. After the first wooden church burned in 1924, a brick church was built in 1926. The structure, designed by architect Angelo Corrubia, was modeled after the Sant&#x27;Ambrogio Church in Milan, in a Lombard Romanesque Revival style of brick and terra cotta. Residents took pride in their parish and donated funds for the new church. It became a territorial parish of the Archdiocese of St Louis in 1955, after existing as a personal ethnic parish until that time.

Baseball greats Yogi Berra and Joe Garagiola grew up on the Hill; their boyhood homes are across the street from each other on Elizabeth Avenue. Four of the five St. Louisans on the US soccer team that defeated England in the 1950 FIFA World Cup came from The Hill, a story that is told in &quot;The Game of Their Lives&quot;, a book () and 2005 film of the same title (released on DVD as &quot;The Miracle Match&quot;).

According to Garagiola&#x27;s book &quot;Baseball Is a Funny Game&quot;, during his youth, the Hill was called &quot; Hill;&quot; the term &quot;dago&quot; was a disparaging and offensive term used to refer to a person of Italian descent. The Hill was also well known to African-Americans, for during the era of Prohibition and bootlegging, the area had an African-American enclave that produced a number of blues songs that referenced The Hill. Other talent from The Hill includes Toni Carroll who made a singing career in New York in the 1950s and 60s, appearing on Broadway and at the Copacabana. She appeared as a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; guest hosted by Garagiola and with special guest Yogi Berra. Hill native Ben Pucci played with the Cleveland Browns in the 1960s.

* In 1926, the blues singer Luella Miller recorded &quot;Dago Hill Blues&quot; about the area. 
* In 1929, the pseudonymous blues singer Freezone recorded &quot;Indian Squaw Blues&quot; in which he sang, &quot;I&#x27;m gonna buy me a mansion, I&#x27;m gonna live on Dago&#x27;s Hill / So I can get my whiskey, honey, right from the still.&quot; 
* In 1932, Tampa Red and Georgia Tom Dorsey sang of the Hill and its connection to illegal liquor in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Get That Stuff No More&quot; – &quot;stuff&quot; being a reference to alcohol.
* In 1934, Charlie Patton mentioned the Hill in his single &quot;Love My Stuff,&quot; a song in which &quot;stuff&quot; again means liquor. 
* In 1935, the North Carolina blues musician Blind Boy Fuller made reference to the Hill in his song &quot;Log Cabin Blues&quot;.

==Demographics and Crime==

In 2020 The Hill&#x27;s racial makeup was 90.4% White, 2.5% Black, 0.2% Native American, 1.1% Asian, 4.5% Two or More Races, and 1.2% Some Other Race. 3.3% of the people were of Hispanic or Latino origin. On June 13, 2020, Black Lives Matter protests overtook the Hill as the neighborhood has struggled with racism and bigotry against African Americans. Reports surfaced that African-Americans were routinely being denied residency which has caused demonstrations and protests during the 2020 BLM riots. In 2020, total crime in the neighborhood has seen a 27.69% rise as the neighborhood has seen more vandalism, property crimes, rapes, and assaults.

==Native-born Italians in St. Louis==
As of 2024, there are approximately 2,000 native-born Italians residing throughout the St. Louis metropolitan region, with almost none living in The Hill neighborhood. The Italian Community of St. Louis, an organization which promotes the Italian language and culture, has several popular events which include Carnevale which occurs in February and Ferragosto which occurs in August. The St. Louis Italian Language Program has its home on the Hill at Gateway Science Academy on Fyler Avenue. St Louis&#x27; Italian sister city is Bologna.

<doc id="425002" wikidata="Q1132324" url="?curid=425002" title="Gloss (annotation)">
<text>A gloss is a brief notation, especially a marginal or interlinear one, of the meaning of a word or wording in a text. It may be in the language of the text or in the reader&#x27;s language if that is different.

A collection of glosses is a &quot;glossary.&quot; A collection of medieval legal glosses, made by glossators, is called an &quot;apparatus&quot;. The compilation of glosses into glossaries was the beginning of lexicography, and the glossaries so compiled were in fact the first dictionaries. In modern times a glossary, as opposed to a dictionary, is typically found in a text as an appendix of specialized terms that the typical reader may find unfamiliar. Also, satirical explanations of words and events are called glosses. The German Romantic movement used the expression of gloss for poems commenting on a given other piece of poetry, often in the Spanish style.

Glosses were originally notes made in the margin or between the lines of a text in a classical language; the meaning of a word or passage is explained by the gloss. As such, glosses vary in thoroughness and complexity, from simple marginal notations of words one reader found difficult or obscure, to interlinear translations of a text with cross references to similar passages. Today parenthetical explanations in scientific writing and technical writing are also often called glosses. Hyperlinks to a glossary sometimes supersede them. In East Asian languages, ruby characters are glosses that indicate the pronunciation of logographic Chinese characters.

==Etymology==

Starting in the 14th century, a &quot;gloze&quot; in the English language was a marginal note or explanation, borrowed from French , which comes from medieval Latin , classical , meaning an obsolete or foreign word that needs explanation. Later, it came to mean the explanation itself. The Latin word comes from Greek &#x27;tongue, language, obsolete or foreign word&#x27;. In the 16th century, the spelling was refashioned as &quot;gloss&quot; to reflect the original Greek form more closely.

==In theology==

Glosses and other marginal notes were a primary format used in medieval Biblical theology and were studied and memorized for their own merit. Many Biblical passages came to be associated with a particular gloss, whose truth was taken to be scriptural. Indeed, in one case, it is generally reckoned that an early gloss explicating the doctrine of the Trinity made its way into the Scriptural text itself, in the passage known as the &quot;three heavenly witnesses&quot; or the &quot;Comma Johanneum&quot;, which is present in the Vulgate Latin and the third and later editions of the Greek Textus Receptus collated by Erasmus (the first two editions excluded it for lack of manuscript evidence), but is absent from all modern critical reconstructions of the New Testament text, such as Westcott and Hort, Tischendorf, and Nestle-Aland.

==In law==

In the medieval legal tradition, the glosses on Roman law and Canon law created standards of reference, so-called &quot;sedes materiae&quot; &#x27;seat of the matter&#x27;. In common law countries, the term &quot;judicial gloss&quot; refers to what is considered an authoritative or &quot;official&quot; interpretation of a statute or regulation by a judge. Judicial glosses are often very important in avoiding contradictions between statutes, and determining the constitutionality of various provisions of law.

==In literature==
A gloss, or &quot;glosa&quot;, is a verse in traditional Iberian literature and music which follows and comments on a refrain (the &quot;mote&quot;). See also villancico.

==In philology==

Glosses are of some importance in philology, especially if one language—usually, the language of the author of the gloss—has left few texts of its own. The Reichenau Glosses, for example, gloss the Latin Vulgate Bible in an early form of one of the Romance languages, and as such give insight into late Vulgar Latin at a time when that language was not often written down. A series of glosses in the Old English language to Latin Bibles give us a running translation of Biblical texts in that language; see &quot;Old English Bible translations&quot;. Glosses of Christian religious texts are also important for our knowledge of Old Irish. Glosses frequently shed valuable light on the vocabulary of otherwise little attested languages; they are less reliable for syntax, because many times the glosses follow the word order of the original text, and translate its idioms literally.

==In linguistics==

In linguistics, a simple gloss in running text may be marked by quotation marks and follow the transcription of a foreign word. Single quotes are a widely used convention. For example:

* A Cossack longboat is called a &quot;chaika&quot; .
* The moose gains its name from the Algonquian or ().

A longer or more complex transcription may rely upon an &quot;interlinear gloss&quot;. Such a gloss may be placed between a text and its translation when it is important to understand the structure of the language being glossed, and not just the overall meaning of the passage.

===Glossing sign languages===

Sign languages are typically transcribed word-for-word by means of a gloss written in the predominant oral language in all capitals; for example, American Sign Language and Auslan would be written in English. Prosody is often glossed as superscript words, with its scope indicated by brackets.

Pure fingerspelling is usually indicated by hyphenation. Fingerspelled words that have been lexicalized (that is, fingerspelling sequences that have entered the sign language as linguistic units and that often have slight modifications) are indicated with a hash. For example, &quot;W-I-K-I&quot; indicates a simple fingerspelled word, but &quot;#JOB&quot; indicates a lexicalized unit, produced like &quot;J-O-B&quot;, but faster, with a barely perceptible &quot;O&quot; and turning the &quot;B&quot; hand palm side in, unlike a regularly fingerspelled &quot;B&quot;.

<text>Porbandar is a city and the headquarters of Porbandar district in the Indian state of Gujarat. It is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi and Sudama. It was the former capital of the Porbandar princely state. Porbandar and Chhaya are the twin cities of each other and both cities are jointly governed by Porbandar–Chhaya Municipal Corporation.

== History ==
===Late Harappan settlement (1600-1400 BCE)===
Onshore explorations in and around Porbandar brought to light the remains of a Late Harappan settlement dating back to the 16th-14th centuries BCE. There is evidence to suggest that the Harappan legacy of maritime activity continued till the late Harappan period on the Saurashtra coast. The discovery of ancient jetties along the Porbandar creek signifies the importance of Porbandar as an active center of maritime activities in the past.

Indian theology views Porbandar as the birthplace of Sudama, a friend of Krishna. For this reason, it is also referred to as Sudaamapuri or Sudamapuri.

=== Princely Porbandar (1600 CE onwards) ===

Porbandar was the seat of the eponymous princely state in British India. Later the state belonged to the Jethwa clan of Rajputs and had been established in the area since at least the mid-16th century. The state was subordinate to the Mughal governor of Gujarat Subah until being overrun by the Marathas in the latter half of the 18th century. After, they came under the authority of the Gaekwad court at Baroda and eventually of the Peshwa.

===After Independence===
Upon the Independence of India in 1947, the state was annexed into the dominion of India. It was merged with the &#x27;United State of Kathiawar&#x27;, effective 15 February 1948 and eventually came to form part of the present-day state of Gujarat. The last King of Porbandar was Natwarsinhji Bhavsinhji Maharaj.

== Geography ==
Porbandar is located at . It has an average elevation of 1 metre (3 ft).

=== Climate ===
Like most of Gujarat, Porbandar has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;) with three distinct seasons: the “cool” from October to March, the “hot” in April, May and early June, and the monsoonal “wet” from mid-June to September.

Almost no rain falls outside the monsoon season, except for a very few late-season tropical cyclones. The most powerful one occurred on 22 October 1975 and produced a storm surge of . During the monsoon season, rainfall is exceedingly erratic: Annual rainfall has been as low as in 1918 and in 1939, but as high as in 1983—when a cyclone caused over to fall over four days—and in 1878.

With a coefficient of variation exceeding fifty percent and an expectation of only 41 percent of mean annual rainfall in the driest year in ten, the Porbandar region is among the most variable in the world—comparable to northern Australia, the Brazilian sertão and the Kiribatese Line Islands.

An illustration of Porbandar&#x27;s extremely variable rainfall can be seen from 1899 to 1905 when seven successive years produced annual falls of:
* in 1899
* in 1900
* in 1901
* in 1902
* in 1903
* in 1904 and
* in 1905

Porbandar, owing to its coastal location, is the least hot of all major cities in Gujarat: Average high temperatures do not reach in any month.
== Demographics ==

 India census, Porbandar (City and urban outgrowth) had a population of 152,760. Males constituted 51.4% of the population and females 48.6%. Porbandar has an average literacy rate of 86.46%, higher than the national average of 74.04%: male literacy is 91.69%, and female literacy is 80.92%. In Porbandar, 9.11% of the population is under 6 years of age.

According to the Census in 2011, the population of Porbander contracted 3.85% in 2011. i.e. the growth rate was negative. The sex ration of the city was 943 in 2011.

== Formation of Municipal Corporation ==
In 01 January 2025, the Gujarat state government elevated Porbandar–Chhaya from a municipality to a municipal corporation, enhancing its administrative capabilities and enabling more comprehensive urban planning and development. This transition is expected to improve infrastructure, public services, and governance for residents. The Porbandar–Chhaya Municipal Corporation now joins the ranks of Gujarat&#x27;s municipal corporations, reflecting the region&#x27;s growth and urbanization.
== Government and politics ==
Porbandar city is governed by a MunicipalCorporation. The Municipal Corporation is responsible for supply of water to the city using Narmada as the main source of water supply. The Municipal Corporation supplies around 14 MLD everyday to the city. As per records available from 2008, the city had a coverage of 39% in terms of water supply connections though the coverage of distribution system was reported as 80%. As per another assessment in the year 2016, Porbandar ranked the lowest in terms the volume of water supplied per capita at 59 lpcd (liters per capita per day) as compared to Gandhinagar which ranked the highest at 245 lpcd. Municipal Corporation is also responsible for waste management in the city and generates about 66 tonnes per day of waste.

<text>In music, letter notation is a system of representing a set of pitches, for example, the notes of a scale, by letters. For the complete Western diatonic scale, for example, these would be the letters A-G, possibly with a trailing symbol to indicate a half-step raise (&quot;sharp&quot;, ) or a half-step lowering (&quot;flat&quot;, ). This is the most common way of specifying a note in speech or in written text in English or German. In Germany, Scandinavia, and parts of Central and Eastern Europe, H is used instead of B, and B is used instead of B. In traditional Irish music, where almost all tunes are restricted to two octaves, notes in the lower octave are written in lower case while those in the upper octave are written in upper case.

If we consider the chromatic scale, new sounds are obtained by lowering or raising the seven diatonic notes by a semitone by means of flats (♭) and sharps (♯). Use of solfege or letter names depends on language. For a more complete table and explanation, see Musical note.

Western letter pitch notation has the virtue of identifying discrete pitches, but among its disadvantages are its occasional inability to represent pitches or inflections lying outside those theoretically derived, or (leaving aside chordal and tablature notations) representing the relationship between pitches—e.g., it does not indicate the difference between a whole step and a half step, knowledge of which was so critical to Medieval and Renaissance performers and theorists.

==History==
The earliest known letter notation in the Western musical tradition appear in the textbook on music &quot;De institutione musica&quot; by the 6th-century philosopher Boethius. A modified form is next found in the &quot;Dialogus de musica&quot; (ca. 1000) by Pseudo-Odo, in a discussion of the division of the monochord.

==Guitar chords==

Letter notation is the most common way of indicating chords for accompaniment, such as guitar chords, for example B7. The bass note may be specified after a /, for example C/G is a C major chord with a G bass.

Where a capo is indicated, there is little standardisation. For example, after &quot;capo 3&quot;, most music sheets will write A to indicate a C chord, that is, they give the chord &quot;shape&quot; rather than its pitch, but some specify it as C, others give two lines, either the C on top and the A on the bottom or vice versa. A few even use the /, writing C/A or A/C, but this notation is more commonly used for specifying a bass note and will confuse most guitarists.

==Choice of note names==

In the context of a piece of music, notes must be named for their diatonic functionality. For example, in the key of D major, it is not generally correct to specify G as a melodic note, although its pitch may be the same as F, as F is diatonic to D major, while G is not. (In many tuning systems other than twelve tone equal temperament, the pitch of G is &quot;not&quot; the same as that of F). This is normally only an issue in describing the notes corresponding to the black keys of the piano; there is little temptation to write C as B although both may be valid names of the same note. Each is correct in its context.

Note names are also used for specifying the natural scale of a transposing instrument such as a clarinet, trumpet, or saxophone. The note names used are conventional, for example a clarinet is said to be in B, E, or A (the three most common registers), never in A, and D, and B (double-flat), while an alto flute is in G.

==Octaves==

Note names can also be qualified to indicate the octave in which they are sounded. There are several schemes for this, the most common being scientific pitch notation.

Scientific pitch notation is often used to specify the range of an instrument. Where sharps or flats are necessary for this, these are related to the natural scale of the instrument if it has one, otherwise the choice is arbitrary.

==Other note naming schemes==

* In many languages (such as those in the Romance and Slavic families), notes are named by solmization syllables (&quot;do, re, mi...&quot;) instead of letters.
* Tonic sol-fa is a type of notation using the initial letters of solfege.
* Alpha is a chromatic extension of the letter notation proposed by the French musician Raphaël André.&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot; note-language=&quot;nederlands&quot;&gt;{

<text>Sun Li-jen (; December 8, 1900November 19, 1990) was a Chinese Nationalist (KMT) general, a graduate of Virginia Military Institute in the United States, best known for his leadership in the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War. His military achievements earned him the laudatory nickname &quot;[[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]] of the East&quot;. His New First Army was known as the &quot;Best Army under heaven&quot; and credited with effectively confronting Japanese troops in the 1937 Battle of Shanghai and in the Burma Campaign, 1943–1944.

Perhaps because of his foreign military training, he did not have the full confidence of Chiang Kai-shek. Sun was relieved of battle command in the Chinese Civil War in 1946, and although he was made Commander in Chief in 1950 after the retreat of the Nationalist central government to Taiwan, he was given only ceremonial roles. He was charged with conspiracy in 1955 and spent his last thirty years under virtual house arrest.

He was also known as Sun Chung-neng (; &quot;Chung-neng&quot; being his art name) and had the courtesy name Fu-min ().

==Biography==

===Early life===
Sun Li-jen was born in Jinnu, Lujiang, Chaohu, Anhui, with ancestry in Shucheng County. During the May Fourth Movement, he was part of the Scouts in the march at Tiananmen Square. In the same year (1919) he married Gong Xitao (龔夕濤) and was admitted in 1920 to Tsinghua University to study civil engineering. Sun played basketball at Tsinghua, becoming a star. He led the Chinese team to a gold medal at the 1921 Far Eastern Championship Games.
With a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship, he transferred to Purdue University in the United States to complete his senior year in 1923, where he graduated in 1924. He briefly interned at Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company in Chicago, Illinois. He worked briefly for Chicago Bridge and Iron Company in Chicago as an engineer. Patriotism motivated him to change career and pursue a military studies instead. China was in the middle of a nationalist drive to unite the divided country and to protect the nation against imperialists. Sun decided that he could better serve his divided nation as a soldier rather than an engineer.

He applied to the Virginia Military Institute. He graduated from VMI class of 1927. In 1927 Sun toured Europe and Japan to see the latest military organization and strategic thinking, then returned to China and became a corporal in the National Revolutionary Army and the Central Political Institute. He was then given command of the National Salt Gabelle Brigade, organized by Finance Minister T. V. Soong, which he made the KMT&#x27;s best trained and equipped troops. Four of the regiments later became the New 38th Division. His training center was located in Duyun, in Guizhou province.
===Second Sino-Japanese War===

Sun led his troops fighting the Japanese during the Battle of Shanghai in 1937 and was badly wounded by mine fragments. After recovering, Sun returned to lead his troops at the front. After two years training, Sun&#x27;s New 38th Division was sent by Chiang Kai-shek into Burma to protect the Burma Road under General Zhang Zhen, commander of the 66th Army, together with General Du Yuming (5th Army) and General Gan Lichu (6th Army) as part of the Chinese Expeditionary Force. Sun led the 113th Regiment as part of the 38th Division through difficult terrain to relieve 7,000 British forces trapped by the numerically superior Japanese in the Battle of Yenangyaung. His command included British artillery and 7th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom) tanks temporarily placed under his command by General Slim. For his gallantry at Yenangyaung, Sun was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by King George VI.

Although unable to stop the Japanese from cutting the Burma Road, Sun gained the respect of General William Slim, the commander of the British 14th Army. Sun and his division retreated into India, while those of Du, against Sun&#x27;s advice, retreated back into China and were badly mauled both by nature and by the Japanese.

Early in 1943, after the successful retreat into India, Sun&#x27;s division was incorporated in the New First Army, and became a part of &#x27;X Force&#x27;, the Chinese force under the command of Joseph Stilwell, the American commander of all American and Chinese troops in the &quot;China Burma India Theater&quot;. The battle discipline of Sun&#x27;s divisions reaffirmed Stilwell&#x27;s respect for the Chinese soldier. His troops spearheaded the Burma Campaign, Stilwell&#x27;s 1943 drive to reconquer North Burma and re-establish the land route to China by the Ledo Road. General Stilwell considered Sun the most capable Chinese field commander in the entire war. In 1945, at the invitation of American General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Sun toured the battlefields of Europe. He returned to China to lead the New First Army to Canton to accept the Japanese surrender.

===Chinese Civil War===
The end of the war with Japan did not bring peace to China. Sun&#x27;s New First Army was deployed to Manchuria, where the Soviet armies left the Communist forces in control of strategic areas and the Nationalists could find support only by enlisting local bandits and surrendered Japanese troops. On May 20, 1946, Sun&#x27;s troops defeated the People&#x27;s Liberation Army to take a key railroad junction in the Battle of Siping, but only after a month of fighting. General Lin Biao&#x27;s communist troops had this saying: &quot;As long as we don&#x27;t have to fight the New 1st Army, we are not afraid of the Central Government&#x27;s million troops.&quot; Sun said that the PLA opposing the Nationalist army was like &quot;flies attacking a tiger,&quot; but when the PLA had a growing series of local victories, Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s favorite Du Yuming repeatedly accused Sun of insubordination. Chiang sensed that Sun could not get the cooperation of Whampoa educated officers and replaced him with a general whom he considered more loyal. Sun was returned to a command post in Nanjing in July 1947, as the deputy commander-in-chief of the Army and commanding general of the Army Training Command. The American Consul General in Mukden at that time, O. Edmund Clubb, later recalled that because of his American education Sun was regarded as an outsider: &quot;personal loyalty was counted by the Nationalist regime as being more important than competence, and when you establish a standard like that you run into danger.&quot;

====Taiwan====
As the commander of the Army Training Command and deputy commander of the Republic of China Army in 1947, Sun moved one training facility to Taiwan, independent from the ongoing civil war. Sun trained new officers and troops for the Nationalist government, hoping to change the tide of the civil war. The effort was too little, too late in comparison with the massive numbers of troops defeated, but one of the divisions he trained (201 Division of the 80th Army) was sent to Quemoy to help crush off the communist invasion in 1949. It was the front line defense force.

In 1950, Sun was named Commander in Chief of the Republic of China Army, while also serving as commander of the Taiwan Defense Command and of the Army Training Command. Sun was well respected by the Americans, and rumors that the CIA sought a coup to replace Chiang Kai-shek with Sun made Chiang and his son Chiang Ching-kuo eager to remove him from power. 

First, Sun was reassigned as the ceremonial chief military adviser to Chiang Kai-shek in June 1954, preventing him from directly controlling any troops. In 1950, Chiang Ching-kuo became director of his father&#x27;s secret police, a position he held until 1965. Chiang Ching-kuo, educated in the Soviet Union, initiated Soviet style military structure, reorganizing and Sovietizing the officer corps while instituting surveillance. Sun Li-jen, who was educated at the American Virginia Military Institute, opposed this system. On May 25, one of General Sun&#x27;s subordinates, Lieutenant-Colonel Kuo Ting-liang, was arrested by Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s associate, internal security chief Mao Jen-feng, and tortured into admitting conspiracy with a communist agent. On August 20, 1955 Sun was officially relieved from his duties and put under house arrest. A nine-person committee under Vice-President Chen Cheng was set up to investigate General Sun&#x27;s involvement in the alleged spy case. The CIA also allegedly wanted to help Sun take control of Taiwan and declare its independence. Sun, in addition to being under suspicion of collaborating with the CIA, was also accused of negligence in allowing his subordinate to participate in an alleged revolt involving Communist agents. One source suggests that the &quot;plot&quot; may simply have been a plan to present a petition to Generalissimo Chiang to do away with the army system of political commissars.

More than 300 of Sun&#x27;s close subordinates were placed under arrest and many more were relieved of their duties. Sun remained under house arrest for more than three decades: his charge was not relieved until March 20, 1988, shortly after the death of Chiang Ching-kuo. Two years later he died of natural cause at home at the age of 89. His funeral was conducted with full military honors and with the presence of the Minister of National Defense and top generals.
In 2001, Sun&#x27;s reputation was cleared after a government investigation into the purported coup attempt. In January 2011, President Ma Ying-jeou formally apologized to Sun Li-jen&#x27;s family and Sun&#x27;s house in Taichung was opened as a memorial hall and museum.

==Family==
General Sun was survived by his two sons Sun Tien-ping (孫天平) and Sun An-ping (孫安平), two daughters Sun Chung-ping (孫中平) and Sun Tai-ping (孫太平), and sister Sun Pi-jen (孫璧人).

<text>The Agelenidae are a large family of spiders in the suborder Araneomorphae. Well-known examples include the common &quot;grass spiders&quot; of the genus &quot;Agelenopsis&quot;. Nearly all Agelenidae are harmless to humans, but the bite of the hobo spider (&quot;Eratigena agrestis&quot;) may be medically significant, and some evidence suggests it might cause necrotic lesions, but the matter remains subject to debate. The most widely accepted common name for members of the family is funnel weaver.

==Description==
The body length of the smallest Agelenidae spiders are about , excluding the legs, while the larger species grow to long. Some exceptionally large species, such as &quot;Eratigena atrica&quot;, may reach in total leg span.

Agelenids have eight eyes in two horizontal rows of four. Their cephalothoraces narrow somewhat towards the front where the eyes are. Their abdomens are more or less oval, usually patterned with two rows of lines and spots. Some species have longitudinal lines on the dorsal surface of the cephalothorax, whereas other species do not; for example, the hobo spider does not, which assists in informally distinguishing it from similar-looking species.

==Biology==

Most of the Agelenidae are very fast runners, especially on their webs. With speeds clocked at , the giant house spider held the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; title for top spider speed until 1987. A recent literature review found peer-reviewed accounts of several agelenid species achieving speeds in this range, though some other taxa have achieved higher speeds.

Agelenids build a flat sheet of nonsticky web with a funnel-shaped retreat to one side or occasionally in the middle, depending on the situation and species. Accordingly, &quot;funnel weaver&quot; is the most widely accepted common name for members of the family, but they should not be confused with the so-called &quot;funnel-web tarantulas&quot; or &quot;funnel-web spiders&quot; of mygalomorph families.

The typical hunting mode for most sheet-building Agelenidae is similar to that of most other families of spiders that build sheet webs in the open, typically on grass or in scrubland as opposed to under bark, rocks, and the like. They await the arrival of prey such as grasshoppers that fall onto the horizontal web. Although the web is not sticky, it is full of entangling filaments that the spider continually lays down when passing over. The filaments catch in the least projections on a prey insect&#x27;s body or limbs. The web also is springy, and whether perching on the sheet or awaiting prey in its retreat, the spider reacts immediately to vibrations, whether from a courting male, the threatening struggles of dangerous invaders, or the weaker struggles of potential meals. They attack promising prey by rushing out at high speed and dealing a paralysing venomous bite. The agatoxin in their venom has been studied extensively in &quot;Agelenopsis aperta.&quot; Once the prey has been disabled, the spider generally drags it back into the retreat and begins to feed. This method of attack is consistent with the high speeds at which the Agelenidae run. Other sheet-web hunters such as some Pisauridae also are very fast runners.

Like any fast-running spider, the Agelenidae possess good vision, and are generally photosensitive (i.e. react to changes in the light), so they can successfully retreat upon perceiving a larger threat&#x27;s shadow approaching. Some are also sensitive to wind blows, and can retreat before the prey even spots them. Males are less successful ambushers than females, so prefer to roam around and wander to new areas, rather than stay in one single web. In September, males of outdoors species (such as &quot;Agelenopsis&quot; and &quot;Agelena&quot;) can seek refuge within houses, usually nesting on or underneath outer windowsills, or also around the porch door. These spiders often are neither pest controllers nor pests themselves; they are very selective in their prey, and do not consume large quantities; also, they are immune to intimidation and come back to their webs even after being disturbed, unless they are completely destroyed.

===Parasocial species===
The type genus, &quot;Agelena&quot;, includes some parasocial spiders that live in complex communal webs in Africa. The best known of these is probably &quot;A. consociata&quot;. Social behaviour in these spiders comprises communal web-building, cooperative prey capture, and communal rearing of young. No trophallaxis occurs, though, nor does any true eusociality such as occurs in the social Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps); for example, the spiders have no castes such as sterile workers or soldiers, and all females are reproductive.

==Medical significance==
Only one species of agelenid has become prominent as a putative cause of a significant frequency of necrotic arachnidism; this is the hobo spider, &quot;Eratigena agrestis&quot;. This perception arose when the species was accidentally introduced to the United States in the mid-20th century and propagated rapidly in several regions. It is a fairly large, rapidly moving spider, so accordingly alarms many people. A few cases of bites have been reported in Southern California by the desert grass spider, &quot;Agelenopsis aperta,&quot; that resulted in symptoms, but determining whether these cases were confused with similar-looking spiders is difficult.

<text>Egg salad is a dish consisting of chopped hard-boiled or scrambled eggs, mustard, and mayonnaise, and vegetables often including other ingredients such as celery. 

It is made mixed with seasonings in the form of herbs, spices and other ingredients, bound with mayonnaise. It is similar to chicken salad, ham salad, macaroni salad, tuna salad, lobster salad, and crab salad. A typical egg salad is made of chopped hard-boiled eggs, mayonnaise, mustard, minced celery and onion, salt, black pepper and paprika. A common use is as a filling for egg sandwiches. It is also often used as a topping for a green salad.

==History==
One of the earliest known printed recipes for egg salad sandwiches was published in the 1896 edition of &quot;The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book&quot; written by Fannie Farmer.

==Variations ==
Egg salad can be made creatively with any number of other cold foods added. Bacon, bell pepper, capers, cheese, cucumber, onions, lettuce, pickle relish, pickles, and ketchup are common additional ingredients.

A closely related sandwich filler is egg mayonnaise, wherein chopped hard-boiled egg is mixed with mayonnaise and mustard.

A popular variant in Russia and the former Soviet states is salad Olivier.

In Jewish cuisine it is made with schmaltz, onions and sometimes gribenes. It can be served with challah as part of the first course of Shabbat dinner, or with matzo. Until the 1980s this dish was also called &quot;Jewish eggs&quot;.

<text>Guion Stewart Bluford Jr. (born November 22, 1942) is an American aerospace engineer, retired United States Air Force (USAF) officer and fighter pilot, and former NASA astronaut, in which capacity he became the first African American to go to space. While assigned to NASA, he remained a USAF officer rising to the rank of colonel. He participated in four Space Shuttle flights between 1983 and 1992. In 1983, as a member of the crew of the Orbiter &quot; Challenger&quot; on the mission STS-8, he became the first African American in space as well as the second black person in space, after Cuban cosmonaut Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez.

==Personal life==
Born in Philadelphia, Bluford graduated from Overbrook High School in 1960. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in aerospace engineering from Pennsylvania State University in 1964, a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) in 1974, a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Laser Physics, again from AFIT, in 1978, and a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Houston–Clear Lake in 1987. He has also attended the Wharton School of Business of the University of Pennsylvania.

His hobbies include reading, swimming, jogging, racquetball, handball, scuba diving and golf. He married Linda Tull in 1964 and has two sons.

==Air Force career==
Bluford attended pilot training at Williams Air Force Base, and received his pilot wings on January 19 for the Aeromechanics Division and as branch chief of the Laboratory&#x27;s Aerodynamics and Airframe Branch. He has written and presented several scientific papers in computational fluid dynamics.

He has logged over 5,200 hours of jet flight time in the T-33, T-37, T-38, F-4C, U-2/TR-1, and F-5A/B aircraft, including 1,300 hours as a T-38 instructor pilot. He also has an FAA commercial pilot license.

==NASA career==

Bluford was selected to become a NASA astronaut in January 1978 as a part of NASA astronaut group 8. He was one of several astronauts recruited by Nichelle Nichols as part of a NASA effort to increase the number of minority and female astronauts. They trained for a year and were officially designated as astronauts in August 1979. His technical assignments have included working with Space Station operations, the Remote Manipulator System (RMS), Spacelab systems and experiments, Space Shuttle systems, payload safety issues and verifying flight software in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) and in the Flight Systems Laboratory (FSL). Bluford was a mission specialist on STS-8, STS-61-A, STS-39, and STS-53.

Bluford&#x27;s first mission was STS-8, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 30, 1983. This was the third flight for the Orbiter &quot;Challenger&quot; and the first mission with a night launch and night landing. During the mission, the STS-8 crew deployed the Indian National Satellite (INSAT-1B); tested the Canadian-built robotic arm (the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) or Canadarm) with the Payload Flight Test Article (PFTA); operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) with live cell samples; conducted medical measurements to understand bio-physiological effects of space flight; and activated four &quot;Getaway Special&quot; canisters. STS-8 completed 98 orbits of the Earth in 145 hours before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 5, 1983.
Bluford then served on the crew of STS-61-A, the German D-1 Spacelab mission, which launched from Kennedy Space Center on October 30, 1985. This mission was the first to carry eight crew members, the largest crew to fly in space, and included three European payload specialists. This was the first dedicated Spacelab mission under the direction of the German Aerospace Research Establishment (DFVLR) and the first U.S. mission in which payload control was transferred to a foreign country (German Space Operations Center, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany). During the mission, the Global Low Orbiting Message Relay Satellite (GLOMR) was deployed from a &quot;Getaway Special&quot; (GAS) container, and 76 experiments were performed in Spacelab in such fields as fluid physics, materials processing, life sciences, and navigation. After completing 111 orbits of the Earth in 169 hours, &quot;Challenger&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base on November 6, 1985.

Bluford also served on the crew of STS-39, which launched from Kennedy Space Center on April 28, 1991, aboard the Orbiter &quot;Discovery&quot;. The crew gathered aurora, Earth-limb, celestial, and Shuttle environment data with the AFP-675 payload. This payload consisted of the Cryogenic Infrared Radiance Instrumentation for Shuttle (CIRRIS-1A) experiment, Far Ultraviolet Camera experiment (FAR UV), the Uniformly Redundant Array (URA), the Quadrupole Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (QINMS), and the Horizon Ultraviolet Program (HUP) experiment. The crew also deployed and retrieved the SPAS-II which carried the Infrared Background Signature Survey (IBSS) experiment. The crew also operated the Space Test Payload-1 (STP-1) and deployed a classified payload from the Multi-Purpose Experiment Canister (MPEC). After completing 134 orbits of the Earth and 199 hours in space, &quot;Discovery&quot; landed at the Kennedy Space Center on May 6, 1991.

Bluford&#x27;s last mission was STS-53, which launched from Kennedy Space Center on December 2, 1992. The crew of five deployed the classified Department of Defense payload DOD-1 and then performed several Military-Man-in-Space and NASA experiments. After completing 115 orbits of the Earth in 175 hours, &quot;Discovery&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base on December 9, 1992.

With the completion of his fourth flight, Bluford has logged over 688 hours in space.

Bluford, an Eagle Scout, was designated as the emissary to return the &quot;Challenger&quot; flag to Boy Scout Troop 514 of Monument, Colorado, in December 1986. On December 18 of that year, he presented the flag to the troop in a special ceremony at Falcon Air Force Base.

== Post-NASA career ==
Bluford left NASA and retired from the USAF in July 1993 to take the post of Vice President/General Manager, Engineering Division of NYMA, Greenbelt, Maryland. In May 1997, he became Vice President of the Aerospace Sector of Federal Data Corporation and in October 2000, he became the Vice President of Microgravity R&amp;D and Operations for the Northrop Grumman Corporation. He retired from Northrop Grumman in September 2002 to become the President of Aerospace Technology, an engineering consulting organization in Cleveland, Ohio.

Bluford was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1997, the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame in 2010, and the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2019.

In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Bluford on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans. In 2006, Bluford was recognized as a distinguished alumnus of Penn State by being selected as the Grand Marshal for his alma mater&#x27;s Homecoming celebration.

In 2020, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine awarded him the Ohio Distinguished Service Medal: Ohio&#x27;s highest non-combat decoration for service.

==Organizations==
Bluford is a member and a fellow of many organizations:

<text>Ranch dressing is a savory, creamy American salad dressing usually made from buttermilk, salt, garlic, onion, black pepper, and herbs (commonly chives, parsley and dill), mixed into a sauce based on mayonnaise or another oil emulsion. Sour cream and yogurt are sometimes used in addition to, or as a substitute for, buttermilk and mayonnaise.

Ranch has been the best-selling salad dressing in the United States since 1992, when it overtook Italian dressing. It is also popular in the United States and Canada as a dip, and as a flavoring for potato chips and other foods. In 2017, 40% of Americans named ranch as their favorite dressing, according to a study by the Association for Dressings and Sauces. Ranch dressing is most prominently used in the Midwest region.

==History==

=== Invention ===
Ranch dressing was invented in the early 1950s by Steven Henson (1918–2007), a Thayer, Nebraska native working as a plumbing contractor in the Anchorage, Alaska area, while cooking to feed his work crews. Henson retired from plumbing at age 35 and moved with his wife Gayle to Santa Barbara County, California, where in 1956 he purchased a guest ranch in San Marcos Pass and renamed it Hidden Valley Ranch.

Henson served the salad dressing he had created at his Hidden Valley Ranch steakhouse, which became popular, and guests bought jars to take home. The first commercial customer for ranch dressing was Henson&#x27;s friend, Audrey Ovington, who was the owner of Cold Spring Tavern. By 1957, Henson began selling packages of dressing mix in stores.

Henson began selling the dry ingredients in packages by mail for 75 cents a piece, and eventually devoted every room in his house to the operation. By the mid-1960s, the guest ranch had closed, but Henson&#x27;s &quot;ranch dressing&quot; mail-order business was thriving.

The Hensons incorporated Hidden Valley Ranch Food Products, Inc., and opened a factory to manufacture ranch dressing in larger volumes, which they first distributed to supermarkets in the Southwest, and eventually nationwide.

=== Commercialization ===
Manufacturing of the mix was later moved to San Jose, then to Colorado, and then to Sparks, Nevada, in 1972.

In October 1972, the Hidden Valley Ranch brand was bought by Clorox for $8 million, and Henson retired.

Kraft Foods and General Foods introduced similar dry seasoning packets labeled as &quot;ranch style&quot;. Clorox reformulated the Hidden Valley Ranch dressing several times to make it more convenient for consumers, including adding buttermilk flavoring to the seasoning, allowing the dressing to be made using much less expensive regular milk. In 1983, Clorox developed a non-refrigerated bottled formulation.

During the 1980s, ranch became a common snack food flavor, starting with Cool Ranch Doritos in 1987. Hidden Valley Ranch Wavy Lay&#x27;s potato chips were introduced in 1994.

In 1992, ranch surpassed Italian dressing to become the best-selling salad dressing in the United States.

During the 1990s, Hidden Valley had three child-oriented variations of ranch dressing: pizza, nacho cheese, and taco flavors.

In 1994, Domino’s first started offering ranch sauce as a condiment with its chicken wings and pizzas, a combination that quickly became popular with customers.

As of 2002, Clorox subsidiary Hidden Valley Manufacturing Company was producing ranch packets and bottled dressings at two large factories, in Reno, Nevada, and Wheeling, Illinois.

In 2017, Hidden Valley Ranch Products turned over $450 million.

==Production==
Ranch dressing is produced by many manufacturers, including Hidden Valley, Ken&#x27;s, Kraft, Litehouse, Marie&#x27;s, Newman&#x27;s Own, and Wish-Bone, as well as Heinz in the Middle East.

== Variations ==
In the Southwestern United States, there is a variant from New Mexican cuisine called &quot;green chile ranch&quot; which adds green New Mexico chile pepper as an ingredient. Regional restaurant chains like Dion&#x27;s produce and sell green chile ranch, as do others.

Other variations include avocado, roasted red pepper, and truffle.

==Trademark lawsuit==

One side effect of the adoption of the name &quot;ranch&quot; for Henson&#x27;s new salad dressing was that it resulted in a federal lawsuit over whether the phrase &quot;ranch style&quot; could be used to describe competing salad dressing products. Since the early 1930s, there had also been an existing product called “Ranch Style Beans”, which is still sold by Conagra Brands today.

In 1975, Waples-Platter, the Texas-based manufacturer of Ranch Style Beans, sued Kraft Foods and General Foods for trademark infringement for their &quot;ranch style&quot; products, even though Waples-Platter had declined to enter the salad dressing market itself over concerns about rapid spoilage.

The case was tried in 1976 before federal judge Eldon Brooks Mahon in Fort Worth, Texas. Mahon ruled in favor of Waples-Platter in a lengthy opinion, which described the various &quot;ranch style&quot; and &quot;ranch&quot; products then available in the 1970s in the United States, of which many had been created to compete against Hidden Valley Ranch. Mahon&#x27;s opinion cites evidence indicating lawyers had compelled Henson himself to sit for a deposition during the discovery process to testify about the history of Hidden Valley Ranch.

Mahon specifically noted that Hidden Valley Ranch and Waples-Platter had no dispute with each other, though he also said Hidden Valley Ranch was simultaneously suing General Foods in a separate federal case in California. The only issue before the Texas federal district court was that Waples-Platter was disputing the right of other American food manufacturers to compete against Hidden Valley Ranch by using the label &quot;ranch style&quot;.
