<text>Ground beetles are a large, cosmopolitan family of beetles, the Carabidae, with more than 40,000 species worldwide, around 2,000 of which are found in North America and 2,700 in Europe. As of 2015, it is one of the 10 most species-rich animal families. They belong to the Adephaga. Members of the family are primarily carnivorous, but some members are herbivorous or omnivorous.

==Description and ecology==
Although their body shapes and coloring vary somewhat, most are shiny black or metallic and have ridged wing covers (elytra). The elytra are fused in some species, particularly the large Carabinae, rendering the beetles unable to fly. The species &quot;Mormolyce phyllodes&quot; is known as violin beetle due to their peculiarly shaped elytra. All carabids except the quite primitive flanged bombardier beetles (Paussinae) have a groove on their fore leg tibiae bearing a comb of hairs used for cleaning their antennae.

===Defensive secretions===
Typical for the ancient beetle suborder Adephaga to which they belong, they have paired pygidial glands in the lower back of the abdomen. These are well developed in ground beetles, and produce noxious or even caustic secretions used to deter would-be predators. In some, commonly known as bombardier beetles, these secretions are mixed with volatile compounds and ejected by a small combustion, producing a loud popping sound and a cloud of hot and acrid gas that can injure small mammals, such as shrews, and is liable to kill invertebrate predators outright.

To humans, getting &quot;bombed&quot; by a bombardier beetle is a decidedly unpleasant experience. This ability has evolved independently twice, as it seems, in the flanged bombardier beetles (Paussinae), which are among the most ancient ground beetles, and in the typical bombardier beetles (Brachininae), which are part of a more &quot;modern&quot; lineage. The Anthiini, though, can mechanically squirt their defensive secretions for considerable distances and are able to aim with a startling degree of accuracy; in Afrikaans, they are known as &quot;&quot; (&quot;eye-pissers&quot;). In one of the very few known cases of a vertebrate mimicking an arthropod, juvenile &quot;Heliobolus lugubris&quot; lizards are similar in color to the aposematic &quot;oogpister&quot; beetles, and move in a way that makes them look surprisingly similar to the insects at a casual glance.

A folk story claims that Charles Darwin once found himself on the receiving end of a bombardier beetle&#x27;s attack, based on a passage in his autobiography. Darwin stated in a letter to Leonard Jenyns that a beetle had attacked him on that occasion, but he did not know what kind:

A &quot;Cychrus rostratus&quot; once squirted into my eye &amp; gave me extreme pain; &amp; I must tell you what happened to me on the banks of the Cam in my early entomological days; under a piece of bark I found two carabi (I forget which) &amp; caught one in each hand, when lo &amp; behold I saw a sacred &quot;Panagæus crux major&quot;; I could not bear to give up either of my Carabi, &amp; to lose &quot;Panagæus&quot; was out of the question, so that in despair I gently seized one of the carabi between my teeth, when to my unspeakable disgust &amp; pain the little inconsiderate beast squirted his acid down my throat &amp; I lost both Carabi &amp; &quot;Panagæus&quot;!
===Ecology===
Common habitats are under the bark of trees, under logs, or among rocks or sand by the edge of ponds and rivers. Most species are carnivorous and actively hunt for any invertebrate prey they can overpower. Some run swiftly to catch their prey; tiger beetles (Cicindelinae) can sustain speeds of – in relation to their body length they are among the fastest land animals on Earth. Unlike most Carabidae, which are nocturnal, the tiger beetles are active diurnal hunters and often brightly coloured; they have large eyes and hunt by sight. Ground beetles of the genus &quot;Promecognathus&quot; are specialised predators of the cyanide millipedes &quot;Harpaphe haydeniana&quot; and &quot;Xystocheir dissecta&quot;, countering the hydrogen cyanide that makes these millipedes poisonous to most carnivores.

==Relationship with humans==
As predators of invertebrates, including many pests, most ground beetles are considered beneficial organisms. The caterpillar hunters (&quot;Calosoma&quot;) are famous for their habit of devouring prey in quantity, eagerly feeding on tussock moth (Lymantriinae) caterpillars, processionary caterpillars (Thaumetopoeinae) and woolly worms (Arctiinae), which, due to their urticating hairs, are avoided by most insectivores. Large numbers of the forest caterpillar hunter (&quot;C. sycophanta&quot;), native to Europe, were shipped to New England for biological control of the gypsy moth (&quot;Lymantria dispar&quot;) as early as 1905.

A few species are nuisance pests. &quot;Zabrus&quot; is one of the few herbivorous ground beetle genera, and on rare occasions &quot;Zabrus tenebrioides&quot;, for example, occurs abundantly enough to cause some damage to grain crops. Large species, usually the Carabinae, can become a nuisance if present in large numbers, particularly during outdoor activities such as camping; they void their defensive secretions when threatened, and in hiding among provisions, their presence may spoil food. Since ground beetles are generally reluctant or even unable to fly, mechanically blocking their potential routes of entry is usually easy. The use of insecticides specifically for carabid intrusion may lead to unfortunate side effects, such as the release of their secretions, so it generally is not a good idea unless the same applications are intended to exclude ants, parasites or other crawling pests.

Especially in the 19th century and to a lesser extent today, their large size and conspicuous coloration, as well as the odd morphology of some (e.g. the Lebiini), made many ground beetles a popular object of collection and study for professional and amateur coleopterologists. High prices were paid for rare and exotic specimens, and in the early to mid-19th century, a veritable &quot;beetle craze&quot; occurred in England. As mentioned above, Charles Darwin was an ardent collector of beetles when he was about 20 years old, to the extent that he would rather scour the countryside for rare specimens with William Darwin Fox, John Stevens Henslow, and Henry Thompson than to study theology as his father wanted him to do. In his autobiography, he fondly recalled his experiences with &quot;Licinus&quot; and &quot;Panagaeus&quot;, and wrote:
No poet ever felt more delight at seeing his first poem published than I did at seeing in Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Illustrations of British Insects&quot; the magic words, &quot;captured by C. Darwin, Esq.&quot;

==Evolution and systematics==
The Adephaga are documented since the end of the Permian, about (Mya). Ground beetles evolved in the latter Triassic, having separated from their closest relatives by 200 Mya. The family diversified throughout the Jurassic, and the more advanced lineages, such as the Harpalinae, underwent a vigorous radiation starting in the Cretaceous. The closest living relatives of the ground beetles are the false ground beetles (Trachypachidae) and the tiger beetles (Cicindelidae). They are sometimes even included in the Carabidae as subfamilies or as tribes &quot;incertae sedis&quot;, but more preferably they are united with the ground beetles in the superfamily Caraboidea, or Geadephaga.

Much research has been done on elucidating the phylogeny of the ground beetles and adjusting systematics and taxonomy accordingly. While no completely firm consensus exists, a few points are generally accepted: The ground beetles seemingly consist of a number of more basal lineages and the extremely diverse Harpalinae, which contain over half the described species and into which several formerly independent families had to be subsumed.

===Subfamilies===

The taxonomy used here is primarily based on the Catalogue of Life and the Carabcat Database. Other classifications, while generally agreeing with the division into a basal radiation of more primitive lineages and the more advanced group informally called &quot;Carabidae Conjunctae&quot;, differ in details. For example, the system used by the Tree of Life Web Project makes little use of subfamilies, listing most tribes as &quot;incertae sedis&quot; as to subfamily. &quot;Fauna Europaea&quot;, though, splits rather than lumps the Harpalinae, restricting them to what in the system used here is the tribe Harpalini. The exclusion of Trachypachidae as a separate family is now amply supported, as is the inclusion of Rhysodidae as a subfamily, closely related to Paussinae and Siagoninae.

The exclusive Harpalinae is presented here, because the majority of authors presently use this system, following the &quot;Carabidae of the World&quot;, &quot;Catalogue of Palaearctic Coleoptera&quot;, or the &quot;Carabcat Database&quot; (which is reflected the &quot;Catalogue of Life&quot;).

Tiger Beetles have historically been treated as a subfamily of Carabidae under the name Cicindelinae, but several studies since 2020 indicated that they should be treated as a family, Cicindelidae, a sister group to Carabidae.

<text>Elm Farm Ollie (also known as &quot;Nellie Jay&quot;) became the first cow to fly in an airplane on February 18, 1930, as part of the International Aircraft Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri, United States.

== Flight ==

=== Background ===
The newly-built St. Louis Arena served as the location for the second International Aircraft Exposition. Organized by the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce, the expo aimed to reinvigorate the floundering aviation industry. The onset of the Great Depression in the United States greatly diminished the market for planes, while supply of aircraft remained high, as did the public&#x27;s concerns about the flight safety. Simultaneously, the industry grappled with internal struggles related to U.S. government air mail contracts which they felt threatened their financial stability. Famous aviators including Edward Stinson and Elinor Smith took part in the expo to help draw crowds. Charles Lindbergh, renowned pilot of the Spirit of St. Louis, was announced as an attendee. Event organizers promised public displays of planes and other aviation exhibits valued at over $2,500,000, an aviation-themed musical, and aerial demonstrations, including several world-record and world-first flights.

=== Record Flight ===
Up until the expo, no cow is known to have flown. In keeping with the motivations for the show, it was hoped that getting a cow airborne would generate buzz about planes, show the stability and safety of aircraft, and demonstrate the possibility of aviation as an effective means to transport livestock. Advertisements for the stunt also promised &quot;scientific data will be collected on her behavior.&quot; Elm Farm Ollie, a Guernsey cow, was flown in a Ford Trimotor piloted by Claude Sterling of Parks Air College from her home at Sunnymeade Farms in Bismarck, Missouri to St. Louis. She was reportedly chosen because of her high daily milk yield, requiring up to three daily milkings. She was milked by Elsworth Bunce, in the process also becoming the first cow milked in-flight. The yield was then put into containers attached to parachutes and tossed out of the aircraft as it flew over the onlookers in the city below. Some accounts state the milking occurred on the flight from Bismarck, while others indicate it took place during a second flight that originated in St. Louis. As Lindburgh was speculated to attend the exposition, some milk was reserved for him, though the speculation proved to be false and he never actually made it to St. Louis.

=== Legacy ===
The story of Elm Farm Ollie turned up several times in trivia books and newspaper articles over the decades, including a feature in the Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! comic strip. She has been enshrined in Wisconsin, the Dairy State, where Barry Levenson, a former state Assistant Attorney General and founder of the National Mustard Museum, made February 18 &quot;Elm Farm Ollie Day&quot; in connection to a festival in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, the museum&#x27;s former location. Levenson&#x27;s contributions to the Elm Farm Ollie corpus include a cantata titled &quot;Madamme Butterfat.&quot;

<text>Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst (or Chalkhurst), commonly known as the Biddenden Maids (1100–1134), were a pair of conjoined twins supposedly born in Biddenden, Kent, England, in the year 1100. They are said to have been joined at both the shoulder and the hip, and to have lived for 34 years. It is claimed that on their death they bequeathed five plots of land to the village, known as the Bread and Cheese Lands. The income from these lands was used to pay for an annual dole of food and drink to the poor every Easter. Since at least 1775, the dole has included Biddenden cakes, hard biscuits imprinted with an image of two conjoined women.

Although the annual distribution of food and drink is known to have taken place since at least 1605, no records exist of the story of the sisters prior to 1770. Records of that time say that the names of the sisters were not known, and early drawings of Biddenden cakes do not give names for the sisters; it is not until the early 19th century that the names &quot;Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst&quot; were first used.

Edward Hasted, the local historian of Kent, has dismissed the story of the Biddenden Maids as a folk myth, claiming that the image on the cake had originally represented two poor women and that the story of the conjoined twins was &quot;a vulgar tradition&quot; arising from a misinterpretation of the image, while influential historian Robert Chambers accepted that the legend could be true but believed it unlikely. Throughout most of the 19th century little research was carried out into the origins of the legend. Despite the doubts among historians, in the 19th century the legend became increasingly popular and the village of Biddenden was thronged with rowdy visitors every Easter. In the late 19th century historians investigated the origins of the legend. It was suggested that the twins had genuinely existed but had been joined at the hip only rather than at both the hip and shoulder, and that they had lived in the 16th rather than the 12th century.

In 1907, the Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing, and the resulting income allowed the annual dole to expand considerably, providing the widows and pensioners of Biddenden with cheese, bread and tea at Easter and with cash payments at Christmas. Biddenden cakes continue to be given to the poor of Biddenden each Easter, and are sold as souvenirs to visitors.

==Legend==
According to tradition Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst, or Chalkhurst, were born to relatively wealthy parents in Biddenden, Kent, in the year 1100. The pair were said to be conjoined at both the shoulder and the hip. They grew up conjoined, and are said to have &quot;had frequent quarrels, which sometimes terminated in blows&quot;. At the age of 34, Mary Chulkhurst died suddenly. Doctors proposed to separate the still-living Eliza from her sister&#x27;s body but she refused, saying &quot;as we came together we will also go together&quot;, and died six hours afterwards. In their wills, the sisters left five pieces of land in the Biddenden area comprising around in total to the local church, with the income from these lands (claimed to have been 6 guineas per annum at the time of their death) to provide an annual dole of bread, cheese and beer to the poor every Easter. Henceforward, the lands were to be known as the Bread and Cheese Lands.

==History==

The churchwardens of Biddenden continued to maintain the annual dole from the Bread and Cheese Lands. It is recorded that in 1605, the custom that &quot;on that day [Easter] our parson giveth unto the parishoners bread, cheese, cakes and divers barrels of beer, brought in there and drawn&quot; was suspended on account of a visit from Charles Fotherby, the Archdeacon of Canterbury, owing to previous ceremonies having caused &quot;much disorder by reason of some unruly ones, which at such time we cannot restrain with any ease&quot;. In 1645, rector William Horner claimed that the Bread and Cheese Lands were glebe (land intended for the use of the parish priest), and attempted to take control of the lands. The case of the Bread and Cheese Lands was brought before the Committee for Plundered Ministers, who eventually found in favour of the charity in 1649. Horner brought the case before the Court of the Exchequer in 1656 but again without success, and the charity continued to own the lands and to operate the annual Easter dole. Witness statements from these cases mention that the lands had been given by two women &quot;who grew together in their bodies&quot;, but do not give any name for the women.

In 1681, the &quot;disorder and indecency&quot; of the annual dole led to the threat of intervention by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The distribution of the dole ceased to be conducted inside the church; it was moved to the church porch.

By 1770, it is recorded that the annual dole took place immediately after the afternoon Easter service. The annual income from the Bread and Cheese Lands had risen to 20 guineas (about £ in 2025), and a huge quantity of food was distributed each year. By this time as well as the dole of bread, cheese and beer, hard bread rolls known as &quot;Biddenden cakes&quot;, moulded into an image of the sisters, were thrown to crowds from the church roof. The Biddenden cakes were flat, hard and made of flour and water, and were described as &quot;not by any means tempting&quot;; one writer in 1860 described one as &quot;a biscuit plaque&quot;.

===Origins of the Biddenden Maids legend===

Although it is known that the charity had been in operation as early as 1656, an anonymous article in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in August 1770 is the earliest recorded account of the legend of the Biddenden Maids. This account states that the twins were joined at the hip only, rather than at both the hip and the shoulder, and that they lived to a relatively old age. The article explicitly states that their names were not recorded, and that they were known only as the &quot;Maids of Biddenden&quot;. The anonymous author recounts the story of their bequest of the lands to the parish to support the annual dole, and goes on to say that despite the antiquity of the events described, he has no doubt as to their authenticity. As with all accounts of the tradition prior to 1790 the author does not mention their alleged birth in 1100, or the name of Chulkhurst; these details first appeared in a broadside published in 1790. &quot;The Antiquarian Repertory&quot; of 1775 says that the sisters had lived &quot;as tradition says, two hundred and fifty years ago&quot;. Drawings of Biddenden cakes from this period show that they featured an image of two women, possibly conjoined, but no names, dates or ages.

Historian Edward Hasted, in the third volume of &quot;The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent&quot; published in 1798, dismissed the legend of the Biddenden Maids. He claimed that the Bread and Cheese Lands were the gift of two women named Preston (although he elsewhere described the lands as having been &quot;given by persons unknown&quot;). Hasted stated that the Biddenden cakes had only begun to be moulded with the imprint of two women in the last 50 years (i.e. since 1748) and that the figures were intended to represent &quot;two poor widows, as the general objects of a charitable benefaction&quot;. While he mentioned a legend that the figures represent two conjoined twins who died in their 20s and bequeathed the Bread and Cheese Lands to the parish, he dismissed it as &quot;a vulgar tradition&quot;.

Hasted&#x27;s arguments were largely accepted by influential historian Robert Chambers, and the story was generally treated as a folk myth. A letter to the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in 1869 pointed out that surnames were not in use in Kent in the 12th century, and that in older styles of English handwriting the 1 and 5 characters could easily be confused, and suggested a correct birthdate of 1500. The Biddenden Maids were occasionally mentioned in pieces on conjoined twins, particularly after Chang and Eng Bunker proved that conjoined twins could live to an advanced age and lead relatively normal lives. &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; magazine called in 1866 for a close examination of Biddenden documents, the editors describing Hasted&#x27;s conclusions as &quot;very obscure and unsatisfactory&quot; and questioning why the names &quot;Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst&quot; should have been added to the design of cakes granted by a family named Preston, but no significant research into the tradition was carried out.
===Growth of the charity===

As the annual dole grew larger the Easter distribution became increasingly popular. In 1808 a broadside featuring a woodcut of the twins and a brief history of their alleged story was sold outside the church at Easter, the first recorded mention of the names &quot;Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst&quot;, and clay replicas of Biddenden cakes were sold as souvenirs.

In the 1820s, a new account of the Biddenden Maids was published, which claimed that a gravestone marked with a diagonal line near the rector&#x27;s pew in Biddenden church was the sisters&#x27; burial place. In 1830 it was noted that Biddenden was becoming thronged by visitors every Easter, &quot;attracted from the adjacent towns and villages by the usage, and the wonderful account of its origin, and the day is spent in rude festivity&quot;. The large crowds were increasingly disorderly, and churchwardens on occasion had to use their staffs to hold back the mob. As a result, the distribution of the dole was moved from the church to the workhouse, but the crowds continued to cause problems. In 1882 Biddenden&#x27;s rector applied for authority to abandon the ceremony; the Archbishop of Canterbury permitted the distribution of bread, cheese and Biddenden cakes to continue, but abolished the free beer in an effort to combat the problem of unruly crowds.

In 1900, antiquarian George Clinch investigated the Biddenden Maids in detail. Examining the costumes of the figures on the Biddenden cake moulds, he concluded that the style of dress depicted dated from the reign of Mary I (1553–1558), a date roughly consistent with the &quot;two hundred and fifty years ago&quot; reported in 1775, and concluded that the tradition had originated in the 16th century. He suggested that the &quot;1100&quot; date on Biddenden cakes had originally read &quot;1500&quot;, and explained the absence of names on prints of 18th century Biddenden cakes as an engraving error. It is likely that the cake moulds examined by Clinch were not the original moulds, as the designs Clinch examined are strikingly different to the earliest surviving drawings of Biddenden cakes, published in 1775. Writing in the early 1930s, William Coles Finch explains the confusion over the dates, saying &quot;the old-fashioned numeral five is so frequently taken as a one&quot;. He lamented the quality of the Biddenden cake then being produced, compared to that of former years. Coles Finch stated that the villagers considered the then-current cake to be unleavened bread.

==Belief and scepticism==
In almost all drawings and Biddenden cake designs, the twins are shown as conjoined at both the hip and the shoulder. Although such a fusion is theoretically possible, in that twins fused at one point may form a secondary fusion elsewhere, no case of a viable double fusion has ever been documented.

Clinch believed that the evidence pointed to the twins having existed but that they had lived in the 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed. They are not, however, mentioned in any journals or books from the period. This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617 – after 1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south-east England would have been widely noted.

In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne considered the case of the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other&#x27;s shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.

Jan Bondeson (1992 and 2006) proposed that, while the names &quot;Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst&quot; are not recorded in any early documents and are likely to have been a later addition, the existence of the twins and the claimed 1100 year of birth cannot be dismissed. Although mediaeval chronicles are unreliable, he noted multiple reports in the Chronicon Scotorum, the Annals of the Four Masters and the Annals of Clonmacnoise of a pair of conjoined sisters born in or around 1100, although all three are records of Irish history and none mention Kent as the location. He concluded that the case of Christine McCoy, who survived for eight hours following the death of her polypagus twin Millie, shows that the claimed six hours between the deaths of the Biddenden Maids is plausible, and agreed with Ballantyne&#x27;s proposal that the idea that the twins were joined at the shoulder is a later misinterpretation of the figures on the Biddenden cake. He also pointed out that although there is no recorded version of the legend prior to 1770, there would have been no possible motive for the villagers of the eighteenth century to fabricate the story.

==Today==

In 1907, the Chulkhurst Charity was amalgamated with other local charities with similar purposes, to form the Biddenden Consolidated Charity, still functioning as a registered charity. The Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing, expanding the charity significantly to provide Biddenden pensioners and widows with bread, cheese, and tea at Easter, a cash payment at Christmas, and distribute Biddenden cakes. (During the food rationing of the 1940s and early 1950s, the cheese was replaced by cocoa. Distribution of cheese resumed in 1951.) A wrought iron village sign showing the Biddenden Maids was erected on Biddenden village green in the 1920s.

The tradition of the dole continues to the present, and every Easter Monday tea, cheese and bread are given to local widows and pensioners through the windows of Biddenden&#x27;s former workhouse. All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden cake, and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors. The cakes are baked so hard as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs; they are baked in large batches every few years and kept until the stock runs out. Historically, the loaves used were of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden&#x27;s last bakery closed in the 1990s.

<text>Garfield Park is a urban park located in the East Garfield Park neighborhood on Chicago&#x27;s West Side. It was designed as a pleasure ground by William LeBaron Jenney in the 1870s and is the oldest of the three original parks developed by the West Side parks commission on the Chicago park and boulevard plan (Humboldt Park, Garfield, and Douglass Park). It is home to the Garfield Park Conservatory, one of the largest plant conservatories in the United States. It is also the park furthest west in the Chicago park and boulevard system.

== Park history ==

The first segment of Garfield Park was formally opened to the public in August 1874. Originally known as Central Park, it was conceived as the centerpiece of the West Park System.

Jenney, now best known as the father of skyscrapers, was influenced by the French parks and boulevards he had seen and studied while living in Paris. That influence is reflected in his design of these West side parks and the connecting boulevards. The park was renamed in 1881 in honor of slain President James A. Garfield.

In 1905, Jens Jensen, now known as the dean of Prairie-style landscape architecture, was appointed as the superintendent of the West Park System where he experimented with design ideas and improvements to the deteriorated and unfinished sections of Garfield Park. Some of the most notable areas are the existing lawns that became the setting for development of the Prairie style of landscape architecture. His most notable work in Garfield Park can be seen in the formal flower garden south of Madison Street, where he combined Prairie-style elements with traditional formal elements, and in the Conservatory.

Garfield Park was initially intended to be used for passive recreation such as strolling and picnicking. Jensen&#x27;s expertise as an engineer led him to design a large lagoon as a means of draining the park site while creating the requisite water features. The lagoon was used for boating in summer and ice skating in winter.

Jensen&#x27;s gardenesque approach to his parks endeared itself to those early park users as one of the first significant attempts at landscape art in Chicago. Throughout its history, Garfield Park has successfully responded to the changing demands placed on a highly used urban open space.

During the 1920s, a major addition was incorporated into Garfield Park: a grand, golden domed administration building for the West Park Commission designed by Michaelsen and Rognstad.

Following the 1934 consolidation of the separate Chicago parks commissions into the Chicago Park District, the &quot;Golden Dome&quot; became the park&#x27;s fieldhouse and center of recreational programs and activities.

Despite additions and modifications in both landscape and buildings in Garfield Park, essential character-defining features such as historic roads and paths, buildings, structures, landforms, water features, and some plant materials still exist. Garfield Park remains as one of the best examples of William LeBaron Jenney&#x27;s landscape architectural efforts in Chicago, and is a rich tapestry of the contributions of several nationally important designers, architects and artists.
Historic features of Garfield Park include architectural landscaping (flower gardens, water court, bridges, lagoons, and the Conservatory); notable architecture (the Golden Dome fieldhouse); the bandshell (or &quot;gazebo&quot; as it is locally known), designed in 1896 by J. L. Silsbee; and the golf shelter building, attributable to prairie school architect Hugh Gardner and built in 1907. There are also a number of historic sculptures and statues within the park.

Recreational features include baseball and soccer fields, tennis and basketball courts, a swimming pool, playgrounds and an ice skating rink. The Golden Dome houses an Olympic-sized gymnasium, gymnastic and fitness centers, boxing ring, and theater. Park patrons can participate in programs for everyone from senior citizens to pre-schoolers, including picnicking, outdoor concerts, and community festivals.

==Race track==

Located in the south of Garfield Park from 1896 to 1905 was a double-ring race track for horses and cyclists.

==Conservatory==

The Garfield Park Conservatory, designed by landscape architect Jens Jensen in 1906–07, is a greenhouse conservatory at the northwest corner of the park.

<text>Vilayanur Subramanian Ramachandran (born 10 August 1951) is an Indian-American neuroscientist. He is known for his wide-ranging experiments and theories in behavioral neurology, including the invention of the mirror box. Ramachandran is a distinguished professor in UCSD&#x27;s Department of Psychology, where he is the director of the Center for Brain and Cognition.

After earning a medical degree in India, Ramachandran studied experimental neuroscience at Cambridge, obtaining his PhD there in 1978. Most of his research has been in the fields of behavioral neurology and visual psychophysics. After early work on human vision, Ramachandran turned to work on wider aspects of neurology including phantom limbs and phantom pain. Ramachandran also performed the world&#x27;s first &quot;phantom limb amputation&quot; surgeries by inventing the mirror therapy, which is now widely used for reducing phantom pains (and eliminating phantom sensations altogether in long term), and also for helping to restore motor control in stroke victims with weakened limbs.

Ramachandran&#x27;s popular books &quot;Phantoms in the Brain&quot; (1998), &quot;The Tell-Tale Brain&quot; (2010), and others describe neurological and clinical studies of people with synesthesia, Capgras syndrome, and a wide range of other unusual conditions. Ramachandran has also described his work in many public lectures, including lectures for the BBC, and two official TED talks. Both his scientific research and his popularization of science have been recognized with multiple awards.

==Biography==

Ramachandran was born in 1951 in Tamil Nadu, India. His mother had a degree in mathematics. His grandfather was Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer, one of the framers of India&#x27;s constitution.

Ramachandran&#x27;s father, V. M. Subramanian, was an engineer who worked for the U.N. Industrial Development Organization and served as a diplomat in Bangkok, Thailand. Ramachandran attended schools in Madras, and British schools in Bangkok.

Ramachandran, whose father wanted him to become a physician rather than a researcher, obtained an M.B.B.S. from Stanley Medical College in Chennai, India.

In 1978, Ramachandran obtained a Ph.D. from Trinity College at the University of Cambridge. Later he moved to the US, where he spent two years at Caltech as a research fellow working with Jack Pettigrew before being appointed assistant professor of psychology at the University of California, San Diego in 1983. He became a full professor there in 1988. He currently holds the rank of distinguished professor in the UCSD Psychology Department, and is the director of its Center for Brain and Cognition, where he works with graduate students and researchers from UCSD and elsewhere on emerging theories in neuroscience. As of July 2019, Ramachandran is also a professor in the UCSD Medical School&#x27;s Neurosciences program. and an adjunct professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.

In 1987, Ramachandran married a fellow scientist who became his frequent co-author as Diane Rogers-Ramachandran. They have two sons, Chandramani and Jaya.

Ramachandran&#x27;s scientific work can be divided into two phases. From the early 1970s until the late 1980s, Ramachandran&#x27;s work focused almost exclusively on human visual processing, especially on stereopsis. Ramachandran began publishing research in this area beginning in 1972, with a paper in &quot;Nature&quot; while still a student at Stanley Medical College.

In 1991, Ramachandran was inspired by Tim Pons&#x27;s research on cortical plasticity. Pons demonstrated cortical reorganization in monkeys after the amputation of a finger. Ramachandran was one of the first researchers to recognize the potential of neuroimaging technology to demonstrate the plastic changes that take place in the human cortex after amputation. Ramachandran then began research on phantom limbs, but later moved on to study a wider range of neurological mysteries, including body integrity identity disorder and the Capgras delusion.

Ramachandran has encountered skepticism about some of his theories. Ramachandran has responded, &quot;I have—for better or worse—roamed the whole landscape of visual perception, stereopsis, phantom limbs, denial of paralysis, Capgras syndrome, synaesthesia, and many others.&quot;

Ramachandran has served as a consultant in areas such as forensic psychology and the neuroscience of weight reduction. In 2007, Ramachandran served as an expert witness on pseudocyesis (false pregnancy) at the trial of Lisa Marie Montgomery. Ramachandran has served as a consultant to the Modius company which is developing weight reduction technology that relies on electrically stimulating parts of the brain that control weight loss.

In his scientific work, Ramachandran often uses simple equipment, such as mirrors or old-fashioned stereoscopes, rather than complex brain imaging technologies such as fMRI. Ramachandran has been outspoken about his intuition-based approach to studying the brain. In an interview with &quot;Frontline&quot; magazine Ramachandran stated:Intuition is what gets you started; then you need empirical studies... brain-imaging technology often lulls you into a false sense of having understood what&#x27;s going on. So sometimes, not having technology - that&#x27;s my own approach and that of some of my colleagues, we use it only when it&#x27;s absolutely essential, just like medical diagnostics. We rely more on intuition in doing simple experiments, because if you rely on fancy medical imaging, you become less creative.

==Research and theory==

===Phantom limbs===

When an arm or leg is amputated, patients often continue to feel vividly the presence of the missing limb as a &quot;phantom limb&quot; (an average of 80%). Building on earlier work by Ronald Melzack (McGill University) and Timothy Pons (NIMH), Ramachandran theorized that there was a link between the phenomenon of phantom limbs and neural plasticity in the adult human brain. To test this theory, Ramachandran recruited amputees, so that he could learn more about if phantom limbs could &quot;feel&quot; a stimulus to other parts of the body.

In 1992, in collaboration with T.T. Yang, S. Gallen, and others at the Scripps Research Institute who were conducting MEG research, Ramachandran initiated a project to demonstrate that there had been measurable changes in the somatosensory cortex of a patient who had undergone an arm amputation.
Ramachandran theorized that there was a relationship between the cortical reorganization evident in the MEG image and the non-painful referred sensations he had observed in other subjects.

Later researchers found that non-painful phantom limbs correlated less with motor or somatosensory plasticity than painful phantom limbs. Recent research has also shown that the peripheral nervous system is involved in painful phantom limb phenomena.

Research continues into more precise mechanisms and explanations.

===Mirror visual feedback/mirror therapy===
Writing in 2009, John Colapinto (author of Ramachandran&#x27;s profile in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;) said that mirror box therapy for amputees was Ramachandran&#x27;s most noted achievement.

Ramachandran thought that phantom pain might be caused by the mismatch between different parts of an amputee&#x27;s nervous systems: the visual system says the limb is missing, but the somatosensory system (processing body sensations such as touch and limb position) says the limb is still there. The so-called mirror box was a simple apparatus that uses a mirror reflecting an amputee&#x27;s good arm so it appears to be the extension of the one missing:
They put their surviving arm through a hole in the side of a box with a mirror inside, so that, peering through the open top, they would see their arm and its mirror image, as if they had two arms. Ramachandran then asked them to move both their intact arm and, in their mind, their phantom arm—to pretend that they were conducting an orchestra, say. The patients had the sense that they had two arms again.

Ramachandran found that in some cases restoring movement to a paralyzed phantom limb reduced the pain experienced. In 1999 Ramachandran and Eric Altschuler expanded the mirror technique from amputees to improving the muscle control of stroke patients with weakened limbs. As Deconick et al. state in a 2014 review, the mechanism of improved motor control may differ from the mechanism of pain relief.

Despite the introduction of mirror therapy in the late 1990s, little research was published on it before 2009, and much of the research since then has been of contested quality. Out of 115 publications between 2012 and 2017 about using mirror therapy to treat phantom limb pain, a 2018 review, found only 15 studies whose scientific results should be considered. From these 15 studies, the reviewers concluded that &quot;MT seems to be effective in relieving PLP, reducing the intensity and duration of daily pain episodes. It is a valid, simple, and inexpensive treatment for PLP.&quot; Similarly, a 2017 review that studied a wider range of uses for mirror therapy, concluded, &quot;Mirror therapy has been used to treat phantom limb pain, complex regional pain syndrome, neuropathy and low back pain. The mechanism of action of mirror therapy remains uncertain, and the evidence for clinical efficacy of mirror therapy is encouraging, but not yet definitive.&quot;

===Mirror neurons===

Mirror neurons were first reported in a paper published in 1992 by a team of researchers led by Giacomo Rizzolatti at the University of Parma. According to Rizzolati, &quot;Mirror neurons are a specific type of visuomotor neuron that discharge both when a monkey executes a motor act and when it observes a similar motor act performed by another individual.&quot;

In 2000, Ramachandran made what he called some &quot;purely speculative conjectures&quot; that &quot;mirror neurons [in humans] will do for psychology what DNA did for biology: they will provide a unifying framework and help explain a host of mental abilities that have hitherto remained mysterious and inaccessible to experiments.&quot;

Ramachandran has suggested that research into the role of mirror neurons could help explain a variety of human mental capacities such as empathy, imitation learning, and the evolution of language. In a 2001 essay for &quot;Edge&quot;, Ramachandran speculated that I suggested that in addition to providing a neural substrate for figuring out another persons intentions...the emergence and subsequent sophistication of mirror neurons in hominids may have played a crucial role in many quintessentially human abilities such as empathy, learning through imitation (rather than trial and error), and the rapid transmission of what we call &quot;culture&quot;. (And the &quot;great leap forward&quot; — the rapid Lamarckian transmission of &quot;accidental&quot;) one-of-a kind inventions.

Ramchandran&#x27;s speculations about the connection of mirror neurons with empathy have been contested by some authors and supported by others.

===&quot;Broken Mirrors&quot; theory of autism===

In 1999, Ramachandran, in collaboration with then post-doctoral fellow Eric Altschuler and colleague Jaime Pineda, hypothesized that a dysfunction of mirror neuron activity might be responsible for some of the symptoms and signs of autism spectrum disorders. Between 2000 and 2006 Ramachandran and his colleagues at UC San Diego published a number of articles in support of this theory, which became known as the &quot;Broken Mirrors&quot; theory of autism. Ramachandran and his colleagues did not measure mirror neuron activity directly; rather they demonstrated that children with ASD showed abnormal EEG responses (known as Mu wave suppression) when they observed the activities of other people. In &quot;The Tell-Tale Brain&quot; (2010), Ramachandran states that the evidence for mirror-neuron dysfunction in autism is &quot;compelling but not conclusive.&quot;

The contention that mirror neurons play a role in autism has been extensively discussed and researched.

===Neural basis of synesthesia===
Ramachandran was one of the first scientists to theorize that grapheme-color synesthesia arises from a cross-activation between brain regions. Ramachandran and his graduate student, Ed Hubbard, conducted research with functional magnetic resonance imaging that found increased activity in the color recognition areas of the brain in synesthetes compared to non-synesthetes.
Ramachandran has speculated that conceptual metaphors may also have a neurological basis in cortical cross-activation. As of 2015, the neurological basis of synesthesia had not been established.

===Xenomelia (apotemnophilia)===

In 2008, Ramachandran, along with David Brang and Paul McGeoch, published the first paper to theorize that apotemnophilia is a neurological disorder caused by damage to the right parietal lobe of the brain. This rare disorder, in which a person desires the amputation of a limb, was first identified by John Money in 1977. Building on medical case studies that linked brain damage to syndromes such as somatoparaphrenia (lack of limb ownership), the authors speculated that the desire for amputation could be related to changes in the right parietal lobe. In 2011, McGeoch, Brang and Ramachandran reported a functional imaging experiment involving four subjects who desired lower limb amputations. MEG scans demonstrated that their right superior parietal lobules were significantly less active in response to tactile stimulation of a limb that the subjects wished to have amputated, as compared to age- and sex-matched controls. The authors introduced the word &quot;xenomelia&quot; to describe this syndrome, which is derived from the Greek for &quot;foreign&quot; and &quot;limb&quot;.

===&quot;Phantom sex&quot; theory of gender incongruence===

In 2008, Ramachandran, along with McGeoch, published the first paper to theorize that gender dysphoria is caused by &quot;a mis-match between the brain&#x27;s hardwired gender-specific body image and the external somatic gender&quot;. The authors surveyed a group of trans women about their experiences of phantom penile sensations following gender-affirming surgery, as well as a group of trans men. Responses showed that trans women experienced phantom penile sensations at significantly lower rates than cis men who have undergone a penectomy. Conversely, trans men experienced phantom penile sensations at equal rates to cis men. In 2017, Laura Case, Brang, Ramachandran, and some other authors, found that trans men experience altered brain activity in regions associated with xenomelia when their breasts are touched. They found alterations of white matter in these regions of the brain too.

==Popularization of science==

Ramachandran is the author of several popular books on neurology such as &quot;Phantoms in the Brain&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Tell-Tale Brain&quot; (2010). &quot;Phantoms in the Brain&quot; became the basis for a 2001 PBS Nova special.

In 2003, the BBC chose Ramachandran to deliver that year&#x27;s Reith Lectures, a series of radio lectures. Ramachandran&#x27;s five radio talks on the topic &quot;The Emerging Mind&quot; were afterward published as a book with the same title.

Ramachandran has also given many talks, including TED talks in 2007 and 2010.

In 1997, &quot;Newsweek&quot; included him on a list of one hundred &quot;personalities whose creativity or talent or brains or leadership will make a difference in the years ahead.&quot; In 2008, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; included Ramachandran as one of its &quot;World&#x27;s Top 100 Public Intellectuals.&quot; Similarly, in 2011, &quot;Time&quot; listed Ramachandran as one of &quot;the most influential people in the world&quot; on the &quot;Time 100 list&quot;. Both the &quot;Time&quot; and the &quot;Prospect&quot; selections were decided by public voting on a longer list of names proposed by the organization.

==Awards and honors==
Ramachandran has received many academic and other honors. For example, from his biography at Edge.org:
In 2005 he was awarded the Henry Dale Medal and elected to an honorary life membership by the Royal Institution of Great Britain, where he also gave a Friday evening discourse (joining the ranks of Michael Faraday, Thomas Huxley, Humphry Davy and others.) His other honours and awards include fellowships from All Souls College, Oxford, and from Stanford University (Hilgard Visiting Professor); the Presidential Lecture Award from the American Academy of Neurology, two honorary doctorates, the annual Ramon y Cajal award from the International Neuropsychiatry Society, and the Ariens Kappers medal from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences.

In 2007, the president of India conferred on him the third highest civilian award and honorific title in India, the Padma Bhushan.

In 2014, the ARCS Foundation (Achievement Rewards for College Scientists) named Ramachandran its &quot;Scientist of the Year.&quot;

<text>Anesthesiology, anaesthesiology or anaesthesia is the medical specialty concerned with the total perioperative care of patients before, during and after surgery. It encompasses anesthesia, intensive care medicine, critical emergency medicine, and pain medicine. A physician specialized in anesthesiology is called an anesthesiologist, anaesthesiologist, or anaesthetist, depending on the country. In some countries, the terms are synonymous, while in other countries, they refer to different positions and &quot;anesthetist&quot; is only used for non-physicians, such as nurse anesthetists.

The core element of the specialty is the prevention and mitigation of pain and distress using various anesthetic agents, as well as the monitoring and maintenance of a patient&#x27;s vital functions throughout the perioperative period. Since the 19th century, anesthesiology has developed from an experimental area with non-specialist practitioners using novel, untested drugs and techniques into what is now a highly refined, safe and effective field of medicine. In some countries anesthesiologists comprise the largest single cohort of doctors in hospitals, and their role can extend far beyond the traditional role of anesthesia care in the operating room, including fields such as providing pre-hospital emergency medicine, running intensive care units, transporting critically ill patients between facilities, management of hospice and palliative care units, and prehabilitation programs to optimize patients for surgery.

==Scope==
As a specialty, the core element of anesthesiology is the practice of anesthesia. This comprises the use of various injected and inhaled medications to produce a loss of sensation in patients, making it possible to carry out procedures that would otherwise cause intolerable pain or be technically unfeasible. Safe anesthesia requires in-depth knowledge of various invasive and non-invasive organ support techniques that are used to control patients&#x27; vital functions while under the effects of anaesthetic drugs; these include advanced airway management, invasive and non-invasive hemodynamic monitors, and diagnostic techniques like ultrasonography and echocardiography. Anesthesiologists are expected to have expert knowledge of human physiology, medical physics, and pharmacology as well as a broad general knowledge of all areas of medicine and surgery in all ages of patients, with a particular focus on those aspects which may impact on a surgical procedure. In recent decades, the role of anesthesiologists has broadened to focus not just on administering anesthetics during the surgical procedure itself, but also beforehand in order to identify high-risk patients and optimize their fitness, during the procedure to maintain situational awareness of the surgery itself so as to improve safety, and afterwards to promote and enhance recovery. This has been termed &quot;perioperative medicine&quot;.

The concept of intensive care medicine arose in the 1950s and 1960s, with anesthesiologists taking organ support techniques that had traditionally been used only for short periods during surgical procedures (such as positive pressure ventilation) and applying these therapies to patients with organ failure, who might require vital function support for extended periods until the effects of the illness could be reversed. The first intensive care unit was opened by Bjørn Aage Ibsen in Copenhagen in 1953, prompted by a polio epidemic during which many patients required prolonged artificial ventilation. In many countries, intensive care medicine is considered to be a subspecialty of anesthesiology, and anesthesiologists often rotate between duties in the operating room and the intensive care unit. This allows continuity of care when patients are admitted to the ICU after their surgery, and it also means that anesthesiologists can maintain their expertise at invasive procedures and vital function support in the controlled setting of the operating room, while then applying those skills in the more dangerous setting of the critically ill patient. In other countries, intensive care medicine has evolved further to become a separate medical specialty in its own right, or has become a &quot;supra-specialty&quot; which may be practiced by doctors from various base specialties such as anesthesiology, emergency medicine, general medicine, surgery or neurology.

Anesthesiologists have key roles in major trauma, resuscitation, airway management, and caring for other patients outside the operating theatre who have critical emergencies that pose an immediate threat to life, again reflecting transferable skills from the operating room, and allowing continuity of care when patients are brought for surgery or intensive care. This branch of anesthesiology is collectively termed critical emergency medicine, and includes provision of pre-hospital emergency medicine as part of air ambulance or emergency medical services, as well as safe transfer of critically ill patients from one part of a hospital to another, or between healthcare facilities. Anesthesiologists commonly form part of cardiac arrest teams and rapid response teams composed of senior clinicians that are immediately summoned when a patient&#x27;s heart stops beating, or when they deteriorate acutely while in hospital. Different models for emergency medicine exist internationally: in the Anglo-American model, the patient is rapidly transported by non-physician providers to definitive care such as an emergency department in a hospital. Conversely, the Franco-German approach has a physician, often an anesthesiologist, come to the patient and provide stabilizing care in the field. The patient is then triaged directly to the appropriate department of a hospital.

The role of anesthesiologists in ensuring adequate pain relief for patients in the immediate postoperative period as well as their expertise in regional anesthesia and nerve blocks has led to the development of pain medicine as a subspecialty in its own right. The field comprises individualized strategies for all forms of analgesia, including pain management during childbirth, neuromodulatory technological methods such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation or implanted spinal cord stimulators, and specialized pharmacological regimens.

Anesthesiologists often perform interhospital transfers of critically ill patients, both on short range helicopter or ground based missions, as well as longer range national transports to specialized centra or international missions to retrieve citizens injured abroad. Ambulance services employ units staffed by anesthesiologists that can be called out to provide advanced airway management, blood transfusion, thoracotomy, ECMO, and ultrasound capabilities outside the hospital. Anesthesiologists often (along with general surgeons and orthopedic surgeons) make up part of military medical teams to provide anesthesia and intensive care to trauma victims during armed conflicts.

==Terminology==
Various names and spellings are used to describe this specialty and the individuals who practice it in different parts of the world. In North America, the specialty is referred to as &quot;anesthesiology&quot; (omitting the &quot;ae&quot; diphthong), and a physician of that specialty is therefore called an &quot;anesthesiologist&quot;. In these countries, the term &quot;anesthestist&quot; is used to refer to non-physician providers of anesthesia services such as certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) and anesthesiologist assistants (AAs). In other countries – such as United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa – the medical specialty is referred to as &quot;anaesthesia&quot; or &quot;anaesthetics&quot;, with the &quot;ae&quot; diphthong. Contrary to the terminology in North America, &quot;anaesthetist&quot; is used only to refer to a physician practicing in the field; non-physicians use other titles such as &quot;physician assistant&quot;. At this time, the spelling &quot;anaesthesiology&quot; is most commonly used in written English, and a physician practicing in the field is termed an anaesthesiologist. This is the spelling adopted by the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists and the European Society of Anaesthesiology, as well as the majority of their member societies. It is the also the most commonly used spelling found in the titles of medical journals. In fact, many countries, such as Ireland and Hong Kong, which formerly used &quot;anaesthesia&quot; and &quot;anaesthetist&quot; have now transitioned to &quot;anaesthesiology&quot; and &quot;anaesthesiologist&quot;.

==History==

Throughout human history, efforts have been made by almost every civilization to mitigate pain associated with surgical procedures, ranging from techniques such as acupuncture or phlebotomy to administration of substances such as mandrake, opium, or alcohol. However, by the mid-nineteenth century the study and administration of anesthesia had become far more complex as physicians began experimenting with compounds such as chloroform and nitrous oxide, albeit with mixed results. On October 16, 1846, a day that would thereafter be referred to as &quot;Ether Day&quot;, in the Bullfinch Auditorium at Massachusetts General Hospital, which would later be nicknamed the &quot;Ether Dome&quot;, New England Dentist William Morton successfully demonstrated the use of diethyl ether using an inhaler of his own design to induce general anesthesia for a patient undergoing removal of a neck tumor. Reportedly, following the quick procedure, operating surgeon John Warren affirmed to the audience that had gathered to watch the exhibition, &quot;Gentlemen, this is no humbug!&quot;, although this report has been disputed.
The term &quot;Anaesthesia&quot; was first used by the Greek philosopher Dioscorides, derived from the Ancient Greek roots &quot;&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;sensation&quot; to describe the insensibility that accompanied the narcotic-like effect produced by the mandrake plant. However, following Morton&#x27;s successful exhibition, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. sent a letter to Morton in which he first to suggested &quot;anesthesia&quot; to denote the medically induced state of amnesia, insensibility, and stupor that enabled physicians to operate with minimal pain or trauma to the patient. The original term had simply been &quot;etherization&quot; because at the time this was the only agent discovered that was capable of inducing such a state.

Over the next one hundred-plus years the specialty of anesthesiology developed rapidly as further scientific advancements meant that physicians&#x27; means of controlling peri-operative pain and monitoring patients&#x27; vital functions grew more sophisticated. With the isolation of cocaine in the mid-nineteenth century there began to be drugs available for local anesthesia. By the end of the nineteenth century, the number of pharmacological options had increased and had begun to be applied both peripherally and neuraxially. Then in the twentieth century neuromuscular blockade allowed the anesthesiologist to completely paralyze the patient pharmacologically and breathe for him or her via mechanical ventilation. With these new tools, the anesthetist could intensively manage the patient&#x27;s physiology, bringing about critical care medicine, which, in many countries, is intimately connected to anesthesiology.

Historically anesthesia providers were almost solely utilized during surgery to administer general anesthesia in which a person is placed in a pharmacologic coma. This is performed to permit surgery without the individual responding to pain (analgesia) during surgery or remembering (amnesia) the surgery.

==Investigations==
Effective practice of anesthesiology requires several areas of knowledge by the practitioner, some of which are:
* Pharmacology of commonly used drugs including inhalational anaesthetics, topical anesthetics, and vasopressors as well as numerous other drugs used in association with anesthetics (e.g., ondansetron, glycopyrrolate)
* Monitors: electrocardiography, electroencephalography, electromyography, entropy monitoring, neuromuscular monitoring, cortical stimulation mapping, and neuromorphology
* Mechanical ventilation
* Anatomical knowledge of the nervous system for nerve blocks, etc.
* Other areas of medicine (e.g., cardiology, pulmonology, obstetrics) to assess the risk of anesthesia to adequately have informed consent, and knowledge of anesthesia regarding how it affects certain age groups (neonates, pediatrics, geriatrics)

==Treatments==

Many procedures or diagnostic tests do not require &quot;general anesthesia&quot; and can be performed using various forms of sedation or regional anesthesia, which can be performed to induce analgesia in a region of the body. For example, epidural administration of a local anesthetic is commonly performed on the mother during childbirth to reduce labor pain while permitting the mother to be awake and active in labor and delivery.

In the United States, anesthesiologists may also perform non-surgical pain management (termed pain medicine) and provide care for patients in intensive care units (termed critical care medicine).

==Training==
International standards for the safe practice of anesthesia, jointly endorsed by the World Health Organization and the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists, define &quot;anesthesiologist&quot; as a graduate of a medical school who has completed a nationally recognized specialist anesthesia training program. The length and format of anesthesiology training programs varies from country to country, as noted below. A candidate must first have completed medical school training to be awarded a medical degree, before embarking on a program of postgraduate specialist training or residency which can range from four to nine years. Anesthesiologists in training spend this time gaining experience in various different subspecialties of anesthesiology and undertake various advanced postgraduate examinations and skill assessments. These lead to the award of a specialist qualification at the end of their training indicating that they are an expert in the field and may be licensed to practice independently.

===Argentina===
In Argentina, specialized training in the field of anesthesiology is overseen by the Argentine Federation of Associations of Anaesthesia, Analgesia and Reanimation (in Spanish, or FAAAAR). Residency programs are four to five years long.

===Australia and New Zealand===
In Australia and New Zealand, the medical specialty is referred to as &quot;anaesthesia&quot; or &quot;anaesthetics&quot;; note the extra &quot;a&quot; (or diphthong). Specialist training is supervised by the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA), while anaesthetists are represented by the Australian Society of Anaesthetists and the New Zealand Society of Anaesthetists. The ANZCA-approved training course encompasses an initial two-year long Pre-vocational Medical Education and Training (PMET), which may include up to 12 months training in anaesthesia or ICU medicine, plus at least five years of supervised clinical training at approved training sites. Trainees must pass both the primary and final examinations which consist of both written (multiple choice questions and short-answer questions) and, if successful in the written exams, oral examinations (&quot;viva voce&quot;).

In the final written examination, there are many questions of clinical scenarios (including interpretation of radiological exams, EKGs and other special investigations). There are also two cases of real patients with complex medical conditions – for clinical examination and a following discussion. The course has a program of 12 modules such as obstetric anaesthesia, pediatric anaesthesia, cardiothoracic and vascular anaesthesia, neurosurgical anaesthesia and pain management. Trainees also have to complete an advanced project, such as a research publication or paper. They also undergo an EMAC (Effective Management of Anaesthetic Crises) or EMST (Early Management of Severe Trauma) course. On completion of training, the trainees are awarded the Diploma of Fellowship and are entitled to use the qualification of FANZCA – Fellow of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, anesthesiology training is overseen by the National Commission for Medical Residency (CNRM) and the Brazilian Society of Anesthesiology (SBA). Approximately 650 physicians are admitted yearly to a three-year specialization program with a duty hour limit of 60 hours per week. The residency programs can take place at training centers in university hospitals. These training centers are accredited by the Brazilian Society of Anesthesiology (SBA), or other referral hospitals accredited by the Ministry of Health. Most of the residents are trained in different areas, including ICU, pain management, and anesthesiology sub-specialties, including transplants and pediatrics. Residents may elect to pursue further specialization via a fellowship post-residency, but this is optional and only offered at few training centers. In order to be a certified anesthesiologist in Brazil, the residents must undergo exams (conducted by the SBA) throughout the residency program and at the end of the program. In order to be an instructor of a residency program certified by the SBA, the anesthesiologists must have the superior title in anaesthesia, in which the specialist undergoes a multiple choice test followed by an oral examination conducted by a board assigned by the national society.

===Canada===
In Canada, training is supervised by 17 universities approved by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. Residency programs are typically five years long, consisting of 1.5 years of general medicine training followed by 3.5 years of anesthesia specific training. Canada, like the United States, uses a competency-based curriculum along with an evaluation method called &quot;Entrustable Professional Activities&quot; or &quot;EPA&quot; in which a resident is assessed based on their ability to perform certain tasks that are specific to the field of anesthesiology. Upon completion of a residency program, the candidate is required to pass a comprehensive objective examination consisting of a written component (two three-hour papers: one featuring &#x27;multiple choice&#x27; questions, and the other featuring &#x27;short-answer&#x27; questions) and an oral component (a two-hour session relating to topics on the clinical aspects of anesthesiology). The examination of a patient is not required. Upon completion of training, the anaesthesia graduate is then entitled to become a &quot;Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Canada&quot; and to use the post-nominal letters &quot;FRCPC&quot;.

===Germany===
In Germany, after earning the right to practice medicine (), German physicians who want to become anaesthesiologists must undergo five years of additional training as outlined by the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Anästhesiologie und Intensivmedizin, or DGAI). This specialist training consists of anaesthesiology, emergency medicine, intensive care and pain medicine, and also palliative care medicine. Similar to many other countries, the training includes rotations serving in the operation theatres to perform anaesthesia on a variety of patients being treated by various surgical subspecialties (e.g. general surgery, neurosurgery, invasive urological and gynecological procedures), followed by a rotation through various intensive-care units. Many German anaesthesiologists choose to complete an additional curriculum in emergency medicine, which once completed, enables them to be referred to as , an emergency physician working pre-clinically with the emergency medical service. In pre-clinical settings the emergency physician is assisted by paramedics.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, anaesthesiologists must complete medical school training, which takes six years. After successfully completing medical school training, they start a five-year residency training in anaesthesiology. In their fifth year they can choose to spend the year doing research, or to specialize in a certain area, including general anaesthesiology, critical care medicine, pain and palliative medicine, paediatric anaesthesiology, cardiothoracic anaesthesiology, neuroanaesthesiology or obstetric anaesthesiology.

===Guatemala===

In Guatemala, a student with a medical degree must complete a residency of six years. This consists of five years in residency and one year of practice with an expert anaesthetist.

After residency, students take a board examination conducted by the college of medicine of Guatemala, the &quot;Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala&quot; (Medicine Faculty Examination Board), and a chief physician who represents the health care ministry of the government of Guatemala. The examination includes a written section, an oral section, and a special examination of skills and knowledge relating to anaesthetic instruments, emergency treatment, pre-operative care, post-operative care, intensive care units, and pain medicine. After passing the examination, the college of medicine of Guatemala, Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala and the health care ministry of the government of Guatemala grants the candidate a special license to practice anaesthesia as well as a diploma issued by the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala granting the degree of physician with specialization in anaesthesia. Anaesthetists in Guatemala are also subject to yearly examinations and mandatory participation in yearly seminars on the latest developments in anaesthetic practice.

===Hong Kong===
To be qualified as an anesthesiologist in Hong Kong, medical practitioners must undergo a minimum of six years of postgraduate training and pass three professional examinations. Upon completion of training, the Fellowship of Hong Kong College of Anesthesiologists and subsequently the Fellowship of Hong Kong Academy of Medicine is awarded. Practicing anesthesiologists are required to register in the Specialist register of the Medical Council of Hong Kong and hence are under the regulation of the Medical Council.

===Italy===
In Italy, a medical school graduate must complete an accredited five-year residency in anesthesiology. Anesthesia training is overseen by the Italian Society of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI).

===The Nordic countries===
In Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, anesthesiologists&#x27; training is supervised by the respective national societies of anesthesiology as well as the Scandinavian Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine. In the Nordic countries, anesthesiology is the medical specialty that is engaged in the fields of anesthesia, intensive care medicine, pain control medicine, pre-hospital and in-hospital emergency medicine. Medical school graduates must complete a twelve-month internship, followed by a five-year residency program. SSAI currently hosts six training programs for anesthesiologists in the Nordics. These are Intensive care, Pediatric anesthesiology and intensive care, Advanced pain medicine, Critical care medicine, Critical emergency medicine, and Advanced obstetric anesthesiology.

====Sweden====
In Sweden one speciality entails both anesthesiology and intensive care, i.e. one cannot become and anesthetist without also becoming an intensivist and vice versa. The Swedish Board of Health and Welfare regulates specialization for medical doctors in the country and defines the speciality of anesthesiology and intensive care as being:

A medical doctor can enter training as a resident in anesthesiology and intensive care after obtaining a license to practice medicine, following an 18–24 month internship. The residency program then lasts at least five years, not including the internship. See also Residency (medicine), Sweden.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, training is supervised by the Royal College of Anaesthetists. Following the completion of medical school training, doctors enter a two-year foundation program that consists of at least six, four-month rotations in various medical specialties. It is mandatory for all physicians to complete a minimum of three months of general medicine and general surgery training during this time. Following the foundation program, physicians compete for specialist training.

The training program in the United Kingdom currently consists of three years of core training and four years of higher training. Before the end of core training, all trainees must have passed the primary examination for the diploma of Fellowship of the Royal College of Anaesthetists (FRCA). Trainees wishing to hold dual accreditation in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine may enter anaesthesia training via the Acute Care Common Stem (ACCS) program which lasts four years and consists of experience in anaesthesia, emergency medicine, acute medicine and intensive care. Trainees in anaesthesia are called Specialty Registrars (StR) or Specialist Registrars (SpR).

The Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT) in anaesthesia is divided into three levels: Basic, intermediate and advanced. During this time, physicians learn anaesthesia as applicable to all surgical specialties. The curriculum focuses on a modular format, with trainees primarily working in one special area during one module, for example: cardiac anaesthesia, neuroanaesthesia, ENT, maxillofacial, pain medicine, intensive care, and trauma. Traditionally (before the advent of the foundation program), trainees entered anaesthesia from other specialties, such as medicine or accidents and emergencies. Specialist training takes at least seven years. On completion of specialist training, physicians are awarded CCT and are eligible for entry on the GMC Specialist register and are also able to work as consultant anaesthetist. A new consultant in anaesthetics must have completed a minimum of 14 years of training (including: five to six years of medical school training, two years of foundation training, and seven years of anaesthesia training).

Those wishing for dual accreditation (in Intensive care and anaesthesia) are required to undergo approximately an additional year of training and also complete the fellowship of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine (FFICM). Pain specialists give the Fellowship of the Faculty of Pain Medicine of the Royal College of Anaesthetists (FFPMRCA) examination.

===United States===

Following medical school training, anesthesiology residency programs in the United States require successful completion of an intern year plus three years of advanced residency training at an ACGME approved program (for a total of four years) for board certification eligibility in the specialty of anesthesiology. Anesthesiology residents face multiple examinations during their residency, including exams encompassing physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, and other medical sciences addressed in medical school, along with multiple anesthesia knowledge tests which assess progress during residency. Successful completion of both a written and oral board exam after completion of residency is required for board certification.

Residency training in the U.S. encompasses the full scope of perioperative medicine, including pre-operative medical evaluation, management of pre-existing disease in the surgical patient, intraoperative life support, intraoperative pain control, intraoperative ventilation, post-operative recovery, intensive care medicine, and chronic and acute pain management. After residency, many anesthesiologists complete an additional fellowship year of sub-specialty training in areas such as pain management, sleep medicine, cardiothoracic anesthesiology, pediatric anesthesiology, neuroanesthesiology, regional anesthesiology/ambulatory anesthesiology, obstetric anesthesiology, or critical care medicine.

The majority of anesthesiologists in the United States are board-certified, either by the American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) or the American Osteopathic Board of Anesthesiology (AOBA). Osteopathic physician anesthesiologists can be certified by the ABA. The ABA is a member of the American Board of Medical Specialties, while the AOBA falls under the American Osteopathic Association. Both Boards are recognized by the major insurance underwriters in the U.S. as well as by all branches of the U.S. Uniformed Services. Board certification by the ABA involves both a written and an oral examination. AOBA certification requires the same exams, in addition to a practical examination with examining physicians observing the applicant actually administering anesthetics in the operating room.

There are several non-physician anesthesia providers practicing in the United States. These include certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), anesthesiologist assistants (AAs), and dental anesthesiologists. CRNAs are the only type of non-physician anesthesia provider that have successfully lobbied for the ability to provide all types of anesthesia for any surgery or procedure independently in some states. AAs must work under the supervision of an anesthesiologist, and dental anesthesiologists are limited to dental cases.

<doc id="417073" wikidata="Q4392694" url="?curid=417073" title="Time Stalkers">
<text>Time Stalkers, also known as in Japan, is a role-playing video game for the Dreamcast featuring appearances of worlds (and playable characters) from several of Climax Entertainment&#x27;s earlier games in crossover fashion. The player initially takes the role of Sword, a character caught in a world made of many worlds. As he goes along, similar heroes show up for the player to control. The player may do things such as enter dungeons, take special assignments, and upgrade/buy/sell items.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Time Stalkers&quot; is a role-playing video game with party members consisting of &quot;Climax&quot; characters as well as in-game enemies that can be collected and trained. The battle system combines RTS and turned based out of phase situational combat. The enemies appear on screen and transition to individual arrangements for RTS style combat. The game takes between 30–60 hours to complete and features multiple endings.

== Plot ==
While going to investigate a clock tower that is said to be the source of a curse, Sword is attacked by an armored figure. He manages to fight it off, and it flees into the clock tower. Sword gives chase, and while searching for the armored figure, finds a strange book. When he opens it, a bright light flashes, and Sword loses consciousness. When he awakens, he finds the Clock Tower has changed, and after exiting, he finds himself in a world that seems to be made up of various disparate locations mashed together.

He meets an old man who simply says to call him &quot;Master.&quot; He tells Sword that the world is threatened by a terrible darkness, and he must protect it. As Sword tries to figure out a way out of the world, the world expands, with more and more pieces added to it, such as a prehistoric mountain, old ruins, a modern-day city, and many more. Sword also meets and teams up with other heroes, such as Nigel from Landstalker.

They eventually discover that &quot;Master&quot; is the one responsible for the creation of the world, and is basically using all the people he has brought into the world as characters in a living story of his own creation. Sword furiously refuses to play any longer, even going so far as to distract Master from watching his precious story unfold. Master retaliates by punishing everyone with unending hunger and thirst.

Sword finally challenges Master to a showdown, with the stakes that if they lose, they&#x27;ll remain in Master&#x27;s story, but if they win, Master lets them go. Master accepts the challenge and creates a final dungeon for their showdown. Sword and his party are victorious, and Master reveals the book that is the source of the world. Sword (or one of the other heroes) closes the book, and all the people of the different worlds who had begun to intermingle with each other return to their respective homes, which are then returned to their worlds.

The ending that follows varies depending on which hero is used to close the book.

==Reception==
&quot;Time Stalkers&quot; received mixed reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Pete Bartholow of &quot;GameSpot&quot; gave the Japanese import a mixed review, criticizing its &quot;traditional&quot; story, randomized dungeon layouts, ugly graphics, and most particularly the resetting of experience points at the beginning of each dungeon. He concluded by advising gamers to instead get the &quot;vastly superior&quot; &quot;&quot; (the Dreamcast&#x27;s only other RPG at that time). Anoop Gantayat of &quot;IGN&quot; praised the unique overworld and the monster capture mechanic. However, like &quot;GameSpot&quot;, he took issue with the resetting of experience points and also complained of the game&#x27;s concise dialogue and short length. &quot;PlanetDreamcast&quot; gave it a negative review, over a month and a half before its U.S. release date. Jeff Lundrigan of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the game, &quot;It ain&#x27;t bad, but the Dreamcast RPG audience needs more than this generic fix.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 27 out of 40. &quot;GamePro&quot; summed up the review of the game by saying, &quot;RPG aficionados looking for that great adventure for the Dreamcast will have to wait—&quot;Time Stalkers&quot; isn&#x27;t it. While it&#x27;ll probably satisfy dungeon crawlers, it will barely get a real adventurer&#x27;s attention.&quot;

<text>Salesforce Tower (formerly known as Bank One Tower, then Chase Tower, and originally conceived as American Fletcher Tower) is the tallest building in the U.S. state of Indiana. Opening in 1990, it surpassed the AUL Tower (now OneAmerica Tower) in Indianapolis for the distinction. The building&#x27;s twin spires&#x27; are tall, while the 48 floors of office and retail space and 2 building equipment floors above that peak at the roof. It is the regional headquarters of Salesforce, which moved into the tower in the late-2010s and currently occupies a large amount of space in the building. While the tower has two spires of equal height, only one of them is functional as a transmission antenna. The other mast is merely an architectural decoration. The building was designed by KlingStubbins, and built by Indianapolis-based Huber Hunt &amp; Nichols.

The tower&#x27;s step pyramidal cap reflects the design of the Indiana War Memorial, three blocks due north. The War Memorial, in turn, reflects the descriptions of the original Mausoleum. Because of the height of this building, its roof was specifically designed to house communications relay equipment, in order to provide additional revenue to the building&#x27;s owners. Over the past several years, two large banners have occasionally been placed outside the north and south communication bullpen areas of the roof in support of two of the city&#x27;s professional sports franchises. These &quot;Go Pacers&quot; and &quot;Go Colts&quot; signs are highly visible being on the tallest structure in the city.

==Observation deck==
The tower has no official observation deck. However, views of Monument Circle and the immediate downtown area can be seen from floors 2 and 7 in the common areas on the Circle side of the complex. In 2017, electronic turnstiles were implemented in the tower as a security measure. In turn, the elevators are no longer accessible by the public. However, Visitors Passes can be attained from the Security Desk in both the Circle and Tower-side lobbies. The tower can be seen from various spots around greater Indianapolis.

==Background and history==
The tower was originally conceived in the late 1970s by Frank E. McKinney, Jr., chairman of American Fletcher Corporation, the holding company for American Fletcher National Bank and Trust Company (AFNB), which at the time was Indiana&#x27;s largest financial institution, to allow for consolidation and expansion of his company&#x27;s headquarters. Land was slowly being assembled for the building, with several predecessor structures along Ohio Street and Pennsylvania Street being demolished in those years and the early 1980s to clear the way for what McKinney hoped would soon be Indiana&#x27;s tallest office tower.

Before construction of the building began, American Fletcher became the first major Indianapolis bank holding company to be sold to an out-of-state financial institution, agreeing in the spring of 1986 to merge with Ohio&#x27;s rapidly growing Banc One Corporation. Upon consummation of that merger, Mr. McKinney became chairman of Bank One&#x27;s Indiana operations and tower planning picked up momentum. Ground was broken and construction began in June 1987 on the newly designated Bank One Center Tower which was to be integrated with AFNB&#x27;s existing headquarters complex on Monument Circle and adjacent Market Street.

This was done mainly to secure the prestigious Monument Circle address for the new tower, which rises between Ohio Street and Wabash Street (the east-west alley between Market and Ohio). Thus, the Ohio Street entrance to the tower is the complex&#x27;s back door with a concourse-style passageway on the second level running over Scioto Street (the north-south alley between Pennsylvania and Meridian) to connect the skyscraper (and its attached parking garage along Pennsylvania Street) to the main entrance in the original 1960 American National Bank Building at 111 Monument Circle.

A separate skywalk across Scioto once connected the Circle Building to the adjacent Fletcher Trust Building at 10 E. Market Street, but that was later removed after the bank moved all operations formerly located in that structure into the new tower. The Fletcher Trust Building itself was subsequently sold and has since been renovated into a Hilton Garden Inn hotel. Banc One Corporation (later renamed Bank One Corporation) went through several additional major acquisitions before it was itself bought by J.P. Morgan Chase in the early 2000s. Upon consummation of that merger, the Indianapolis structure was renamed to become known as the Chase Tower, but Chase was not allowed to attach its name and logo to the top of the building until 2013 after the building changed owners.

On May 6, 2016, Salesforce announced plans to lease hundreds of thousands of square feet in the building and start moving employees there in early 2017. The building has since been rebranded as Salesforce Tower Indianapolis.

<text>Erich Karl Warsitz (18 October 1906 – 12 July 1983) was a German test pilot of the 1930s. He held the rank of Flight-Captain in the Luftwaffe and was selected by the Reich Air Ministry as chief test pilot at Peenemünde West. He is remembered as the first person to fly an aircraft under liquid-fueled rocket power, the Heinkel He 176, on June 20, 1939 and also the first to fly an aircraft under turbojet power, the Heinkel He 178, on August 27 the same year.

==Biography==

===Aviation career===
Warsitz was born at Hattingen.

Together with his practical tuition and technical studies, Erich Warsitz’ aeronautical training as a sport flier for the A-2 licence began at the Academic Aviation Group Bonn/Hangelar (1929-1930). In stages subsequently came the B-1 and B-2 training at various aerodromes of the contemporary sports associations, and further training at DVS (German Commercial Pilot School) at Stettin for the C-2 (land aircraft and commercial carriage of persons) and all licences for flights over the sea. Meanwhile, he was awarded the major K-2 aerobatics licence, passed the blind-flying training and obtained the navigation certificate for short distances. After he had been to DVS and obtained all flying licences there, he took employment as a sporting aircraft instructor and was later transferred to the Reichsbahnstrecke (i.e. the Railway section, a cover name for long-distance flying experience, a unit concealed within the 100,000-man Weimar standing army) as flight instructor, senior flight instructor and then training leader. In 1934 orders arrived drafting him to Rechlin, the Luftwaffe’s test centre. At that time the German aviation industry was operating at full blast, and at Rechlin Erich Warsitz was soon flying everything the aircraft factories could produce. This was the starting point of an activity which, only a little while later, would bring him into intimate contact with developments in aviation which were of tremendous historical importance.

====Heinkel He 111 and 112====

Late in 1936 Erich Warsitz was seconded by the RLM to Wernher von Braun and Ernst Heinkel, because he had been recognized as one of the most experienced test-pilots of the time, and because he also had an extraordinary fund of technical knowledge. In 1937, working closely with Wernher von Braun, Erich Warsitz undertook the initial flight testing of the Heinkel He 112 fitted with von Braun&#x27;s rocket engine. Despite the wheels-up landing and having the fuselage on fire, it proved to official circles that an aircraft could be flown satisfactorily with a back-thrust system through the rear.
In parallel the RLM had suddenly acquired an interest in so-called rocket boosters fitted for the sake of simplicity below the wings of a heavily loaded bomber to cut down the length of runway needed for take-off from small aerodromes and airfields. Once in the air the spent booster casings would be dropped by parachute for re-use. The firm of Hellmuth Walter at Kiel handled this development. The first standing trials and tests flights of their boosters were also held at Neuhardenberg using a Heinkel He 111E placed at disposal by Heinkel. 

Walter had also been commissioned by the RLM to build a rocket engine for the He 112, so there were two different new rocket motor designs at Neuhardenberg: whereas the von Braun&#x27;s engines were powered by alcohol and liquid oxygen, Walter engines had hydrogen peroxide and calcium permanganate as a catalyst. Von Braun&#x27;s engine used direct combustion and created fire, the Walter devices hot vapours from a chemical reaction, but both created thrust and provided high speed. The subsequent flights with the He 112 used the Walter-rocket instead of von Braun&#x27;s; it was more reliable, simpler to operate and the dangers to pilot and machine were less. All those test flights at Neuhardenberg were made by Erich Warsitz.

====Heinkel He 176====

During the development programme at Neuhardenberg the term &quot;interceptor&quot; had been coined, and the Heinkel He 176 was seen as the research machine for the project. The RLM was really thinking along the lines of a new kind of fighter aircraft. With a fantastic rate of climb it would take off almost vertically to intercept enemy bomber formations at 6000 – 7000 metres, make a swift attack from below at high speed, emptying the MGs or cannons into the enemy machines and then land once the fuel tanks were dry. The Messerschmitt Me 163, which was developed and tested independently of the He 176, came later, during the Second World War, as an operational interceptor.
Because the He 176 development was classified top secret, Heinkel set up a special department in his Rostock-Marienehe works. A wooden barrack hut was erected first for the initial testing. Only very few employees were allowed access. This &quot;shed&quot; was soon converted into a permanent building. The development then progressed very quickly. Ground work began at Peenemünde-West with rolling tests to establish the characteristics on the runway.
There came a moment when Erich Warsitz felt that a series of brief hops in the He 176 had made him familiar with its characteristics and nasty tricks, and he suddenly made up his mind to carry out the first real flight on June 20, 1939.

====Heinkel He 178====

The He 176 rocket aircraft had been developed in close collaboration with the RLM, but in spite of its success, Heinkel did not receive the support he had hoped for. In fact, there were many important individuals at the Air Ministry who showed an interest, but the Second World War was imminent, and other concerns took centre stage. The He 178 design was pushed through without the knowledge of the RLM, and it was this small aircraft which was later to usher in the Jet Age.
On August 27, 1939 Erich Warsitz undertook the world first jet flight with the Heinkel He 178 fitted with Hans von Ohain’s jet engine, the He S 3 turbine.

After the second circuit Erich Warsitz set the He 178 up for the landing. The turbine responded to the throttle lever very obediently. Just above the ground he corrected the machine’s attitude, pulled off a perfect landing and came to a halt just short of the waters of the Warnow.

====World War II====
After the Führer-Directive, ordering all developments not ready for mass-production within a year to be suspended with immediate effect, Erich Warsitz dedicated himself fully to his work as chief test pilot at Peenemünde-West. In 1941 also as an instructor in Nantes and Eindhoven training the bomber squadrons the correct use of the rocket boosters (Heinkel He 111 and Junkers Ju 88). 

In 1942, during a test flight with a Messerschmitt Bf 109, he had an accident – caused by a faulty fuel lead – which put him out of flying for a year. Thus he took over the management of his father’s precision mechanical firm and also founded the ‘Warsitz Werke’ in Amsterdam making various high-precision materials.

===Post-war===

After the end of the war, Warsitz was living in an apartment in the American sector of Berlin, but at 3 a.m. on the night of 5 / December 6, 1945 he was abducted by four Soviet officers. Numerous interrogations followed, concentrating on his former work on the development of rocket and jet aircraft in the OKH and RLM, at Peenemünde and the Heinkel factory. He was required to sign a contract which obliged him to co-operate with the Soviets for a period of five years on the development of related technology, but he refused. As a result, he was condemned to twenty-five years forced labour. Shortly after this he was transported to Siberia, to the penal colony 7525/13.

After his return in 1950, thanks to Chancellor of West Germany Konrad Adenauer, he founded his precision mechanical firm “Maschinenfabrik Hilden”, until, in 1965, he retired.

==Death==
In April 1983, Warsitz suffered a stroke and as a result died at the age of 76 on July 12, 1983, at Lugano, Switzerland.

==Commemoration==
For his flying achievements, Erich Warsitz’ memory was honoured with a special stamp issue by the German Post Office on October 4, 2007.

<text>Charles Herbert Allen (April 15, 1848 – April 20, 1934) was an American politician and businessman. After serving in state and federal elected positions, he was appointed as the first United States-appointed civilian governor of Puerto Rico when the U.S. acquired it after the Spanish–American War. He previously had served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President William McKinley.

After returning to the U.S. from Puerto Rico, Allen headed for Wall Street and became a vice president of Morton Trust Company and its successor, the Guaranty Trust Company of New York. He formed the American Sugar Refining Company—a sugar syndicate which, by 1907, was the largest in the world. It owned or controlled 98% of the sugar processing capacity in the U.S. and was known as the Sugar Trust. Allen was treasurer of American Sugar Refining in 1910, its president in 1913, and in 1915 he joined its board of directors. In the early 21st century, the company is known as Domino Sugar.

==Early life==
Allen was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, on April 15, 1848, to Otis and Louisa (Bixby) Allen. He attended public and private schools. He did his undergraduate work at Amherst College, where he graduated in 1869. He worked with his father in their company, Otis Allen and Son, a lumber business that manufactured wooden boxes and sold railroad ties, housing frames, and road building materials.

==Political career==
Allen joined the Republican Party and was elected to two terms in the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1881 and 1882; and one term in the Massachusetts Senate in 1883. He was elected as a Republican to the Forty-ninth and Fiftieth Congresses, serving March 4, 1885 to March 3, 1889. In 1890, Allen was nominated for governor of Massachusetts by the Republicans, but was defeated by William E. Russell.

In 1884, he received the title &quot;Colonel,&quot; when Governor George Dexter Robinson appointed him to his personal staff. He also was appointed as the Massachusetts Prison Commissioner from 1897 to 1898.

In 1898 President William McKinley named Allen as Assistant Secretary of the Navy when Theodore Roosevelt resigned the post to enter the Spanish–American War. He held this position from 1898 to 1900.

==Governor of Puerto Rico==

When the war ended, President McKinley appointed Allen as the first civilian governor of Puerto Rico, and he served from 1900 to 1901. Though Allen had a business background, his financial administration of Puerto Rico has been criticized by historians Thomas Aitken Jr. and Manuel Maldonado-Denis. The revenue for the island&#x27;s government was raised internally, mostly from tariffs, sales taxes and property taxes. During Allen&#x27;s tenure this annual budget equaled the 4.4 million pesos the Spanish had spent in 1897, but without expenses for a five-thousand man garrison or the former contributions to the Catholic church.

Due to this reduced overhead, the island should have had a substantial budget surplus, but Allen&#x27;s administration did not provide many benefits for the people. He ignored the appropriation requests of the Puerto Rican House of Delegates, and refused to make any municipal, agricultural or small business loans. He built roads at double the old costs. 85% of the school-age population did not have schools. Instead of making needed infrastructure and education investments, Allen re-directed the insular budget to no-bid contracts for U.S. businessmen, railroad subsidies for U.S.-owned sugar plantations, and high salaries for U.S. bureaucrats in the island government.

Allen was also listed as one of the &quot;Politicians in the Lumber and Timber Business in Puerto Rico.&quot;

By the time Allen left in 1901, nearly all of the governor&#x27;s 11-member Executive Council were U.S. expatriates. Half the appointive offices in the government of Puerto Rico had been given to visiting Americans, 626 of them at top salaries.

==Life after politics==
After resigning as governor in 1901, Allen headed to Wall Street and joined the House of Morgan as vice-president of both the Morgan Trust Company and the Guaranty Trust Company of New York. Through these connections, he built a sugar syndicate in Puerto Rico. By 1907 this syndicate, the American Sugar Refining Company, owned or controlled 98% of the sugar processing capacity in the United States and was known as the Sugar Trust.

By 1910 Allen was treasurer of the American Sugar Refining Company, by 1913 he was its president, and by 1915 he sat on its board of directors. While Allen built the largest sugar syndicate in the world, his political appointees in Puerto Rico provided him with land grants, tax subsidies, water rights, railroad easements, foreclosure sales and favorable tariffs. Today, the Allen sugar syndicate is known as Domino Sugar.

==Private life==
Allen had married Harriet C. Dean of Manchester, New Hampshire, in 1870, and they lived in Lowell on Rolfe Street, at their home called &quot;The Terraces&quot;, today part of UMass Lowell. They raised two daughters, Bertha and Louise.

While Allen and his family were living in Puerto Rico when he was governor, his daughter Bertha Allen married naval officer George W. Logan in 1900. Their wedding was at the Palace, the governor&#x27;s residence. The second daughter, Louise Allen (1875–1953), became a sculptor and a member of many artistic societies. Her son, Allen Hobbs, was a hydrographer in the US Navy. He was appointed as the 32nd Governor of American Samoa when it was a military position.

Allen pursued a variety of leisure interests. He was an avid painter, and completed twenty-seven landscape and marine paintings. These are held in the Allen Collection of the Whistler House Museum of Art in Lowell.

Interested in gardens, he ensured that the grounds of his home, &quot;The Terraces,&quot; were planted with gardens, fountains, a pergola, and a large gazebo. The latter can be seen in photographs of the Allen House Collection, University of Massachusetts Center for Lowell History. It was donated by Walter E. Hayes, his groundskeeper.

Charles Herbert Allen died in Lowell and is buried in Lowell Cemetery. A memorial was created to honor his name.

==Legacy and honors==
* The Terraces, is now called Allen House and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is within the boundaries of the South Campus of the University of Massachusetts Lowell.

<doc id="417090" wikidata="Q682154" url="?curid=417090" title="Drama Desk Award">
<text>The Drama Desk Award is an annual prize recognizing excellence in New York theatre. First bestowed in 1955 as the Vernon Rice Award, the prize initially honored Off-Broadway productions, as well as Off-off-Broadway, and those in the vicinity. Following the 1964 renaming as the Drama Desk Awards, Broadway productions were included beginning with the 1968–69 award season. The awards are considered a significant American theater distinction.

==History==
The Drama Desk organization was formed in 1949 by a group of New York theater critics, editors, reporters and publishers, in order to make the public aware of the vital issues concerning the theatrical industry. They debuted the presentations of the &quot;Vernon Rice Awards&quot;. The name honors the &quot;New York Post&quot; critic Vernon Rice, who had pioneered Off-Broadway coverage in the New York press. The name was changed for the 1963–1964 awards season to the &quot;Drama Desk Awards&quot;.

In 1974, the Drama Desk became incorporated as a not-for-profit organization. In 1975, the Drama Desk announcement of winners included the nominees as well.

The Drama Desk has more than 100 members, including theatre critics, reporters and editors who cover New York theater and vote on the awards. Membership consists of two categories: active (voting) membership and participating membership.

All of the Drama Desk officers and nominating committee members perform their various services for the organization on a voluntary basis. The nominating committee generally meets twice a month to discuss the many eligible shows members are responsible for seeing. They then nominate the productions on which the entire membership will vote. What sets the organization apart is that the awards are voted on &quot;by media people only without any vested interests in the results&quot;, according to the organization.

Previous winners include Bernadette Peters, Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, among many others.

The Drama Desk Awards have contributed to the ongoing success of major stars, playwrights and designers, while also identifying newcomers. The Drama Desk was the first New York theater organization to give awards to talents such as Edward Albee, Wendy Wasserstein, and George C. Scott. Plays like &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;, &quot;Other People&#x27;s Money&quot;, &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;, and &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot; built momentum with the help of Drama Desk wins.

In keeping with its original mission, the organization sponsors guest panel luncheons with theater professionals. Panels address topics of current interest: covering the season on Broadway, Off-Broadway, and Off-Off-Broadway, with the aim of prompting informative and stimulating discussion.

<doc id="417092" wikidata="Q705022" url="?curid=417092" title="John Gregory Dunne">
<text>John Gregory Dunne (May 25, 1932 – December 30, 2003) was an American writer. He began his career as a journalist for &quot;Time&quot; magazine before expanding into writing criticism, essays, novels, and screenplays. He often collaborated with his wife, Joan Didion.

==Early life==
Dunne was born in Hartford, Connecticut and was a younger brother of author Dominick Dunne. He was the son of Dorothy Frances (née Burns) and Richard Edwin Dunne (1894–1946), a hospital chief of staff and heart surgeon. John was the fifth of six children in the family. John&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Dominick Francis Burns (1857–1940), founded the Park Street Trust Company.

John Dunne developed a severe stutter as a child and took up writing to express himself. He learned to manage it by observing others. He attended the Portsmouth Abbey School and graduated from Princeton University in 1954, where he was a member of Tiger Inn.

== Career ==
Dunne started working as a journalist in New York City for &quot;Time&quot; magazine. He credited the political essayist Noel Parmentel as a mentor in many ways.

In the late 1950s, he met Joan Didion in New York City, where she was an editor at &quot;Vogue&quot;. In a 2005 interview, Didion recalled, &quot;We amused each other and I thought he was smart. He knew a lot of stuff that I didn&#x27;t know, like politics and history. I had managed to go through school without learning much except a lot of poems.&quot; He invited her to travel to Connecticut one weekend in 1963 to visit his family, New England Irish Catholic, with six children. Didion said she &quot;liked the set-up, liked being there, and liked him.&quot;

After they married in 1964, the couple moved to a remote house on the California coast; Didion worked on a novel to follow her debut &quot;Run, River&quot;, and Dunne on a book about the California grape pickers&#x27; strike. They wrote a jointly bylined column for the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; magazine for years.

Dunne and Didion gradually picked up writing work from book publishers and magazines, traveled together on journalism assignments, and established a working pattern that served for the next 40 years. They had a constant advising, consulting, and editing collaboration. Critically acclaimed bestselling books followed for each, including Dunne&#x27;s &quot;The Studio&quot;, his nonfiction account of 20th Century Fox.

They also collaborated on a series of screenplays, including &quot;The Panic in Needle Park&quot; (1971), &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1976), and &quot;True Confessions&quot; (1981), an adaptation of Dunne&#x27;s novel of the same name. He wrote a nonfiction book about Hollywood, &quot;.&quot;

As a literary critic and essayist, Dunne was a frequent contributor to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. His essays were collected in two books, &quot;Quintana &amp; Friends&quot; (1980) and &quot;Crooning&quot; (1990). He wrote several novels, among them &quot;True Confessions&quot;, based loosely on the Black Dahlia murder, and &quot;Dutch Shea, Jr.&quot; He was the writer and narrator of the 1990 PBS documentary &quot;L.A. is It with John Gregory Dunne&quot;, in which he guided viewers through Los Angeles&#x27;s cultural landscape.

Dunne and Didion later moved to Manhattan. He died there of a heart attack on December 30, 2003. His final novel, &quot;Nothing Lost&quot;, which was in galleys at the time of his death, was published in 2004.

== Personal life ==
Dunne married Didion on January 30, 1964, at Mission San Juan Bautista in California. He was 31 and she 29. They contemplated filing for divorce in 1969, as Didion famously wrote in one of her essays. Unable to have children, in 1966 they adopted a baby at birth and named her Quintana Roo, after the Mexican state. Quintana died in 2005 after a series of illnesses.

Dunne was uncle to actors Griffin Dunne (who co-starred in &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;) and Dominique Dunne (who co-starred in &quot;Poltergeist&quot;).

Didion wrote and published &quot;The Year of Magical Thinking&quot; (2005), a memoir of the year following his death, during which their daughter was seriously ill. It won critical acclaim and the National Book Award.

<doc id="417101" wikidata="Q7758837" url="?curid=417101" title="The Putney School">
<text>The Putney School is an independent high school in Putney, Vermont. The school was founded in 1935 by Carmelita Hinton on the principles of the Progressive Education movement and the teachings of its principal exponent, John Dewey. It is a co-educational, college-preparatory boarding school, with a day-student component, outside Brattleboro, Vermont. Danny O&#x27;Brien became head of school in 2022. The school enrolls approximately 225 students on a hilltop campus with classrooms, dormitories, and a dairy farm on which its students work before graduating.

Based on its founder&#x27;s principles, the school continues to emphasize academics, a work program, the arts, and physical activity. Its curriculum is intended to teach the value of labor, art, community, ethics, and scholarship for individual growth.

==Campus==

The original buildings on Putney&#x27;s campus were overhauled or constructed by Putney work camp attendees, students, and faculty in 1935. The Currier Center is a departure from Putney&#x27;s customary white, colonial-style architecture, instead using stone and concrete walls in an angular design. It is used for dance, music, movie-making and visual-art presentations. The Field House, which opened in October 2009, was designed as a &quot;net zero-energy building&quot;.

There are ten active dormitories on campus: Huseby, New Boys, Leonard&#x27;s Keep (Keep), Noyes, White Cottage, John Rogers (JR), Hepper, Gund, Gray House, and Heights. A few faculty members live in each.

==Academic program==

In 1995, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; described Putney as combining &quot;a New England work ethic and a strong academic program.&quot; It is a member of the Independent Curriculum Group and in 2009 received a 10-year accreditation review by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.

== Tuition ==
Tuition for the 2023-24 academic year is $74,500 for boarding students and $45,400 for day students.

<doc id="417111" wikidata="Q621261" url="?curid=417111" title="Pain management">
<text>Pain management is an aspect of medicine and health care involving relief of pain (pain relief, analgesia, pain control) in various dimensions, from acute and simple to chronic and challenging. Most physicians and other health professionals provide some pain control in the normal course of their practice, and for the more complex instances of pain, they also call on additional help from a specific medical specialty devoted to pain, which is called pain medicine.

Pain management often uses a multidisciplinary approach for easing the suffering and improving the quality of life of anyone experiencing pain, whether acute pain or chronic pain. Relief of pain in general (analgesia) is often an acute affair, whereas managing chronic pain requires additional dimensions.

A typical multidisciplinary pain management team may include: medical practitioners, pharmacists, clinical psychologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, recreational therapists, physician assistants, nurses, and dentists. The team may also include other mental health specialists and massage therapists. Pain sometimes resolves quickly once the underlying trauma or pathology has healed, and is treated by one practitioner, with drugs such as pain relievers (analgesics) and occasionally also anxiolytics.

Effective management of chronic (long-term) pain, however, frequently requires the coordinated efforts of the pain management team. Effective pain management does not always mean total eradication of all pain. Rather, it often means achieving adequate quality of life in the presence of pain, through any combination of lessening the pain and/or better understanding it and being able to live happily despite it. Medicine treats injuries and diseases to support and speed healing. It treats distressing symptoms such as pain and discomfort to reduce any suffering during treatment, healing, and dying.

The task of medicine is to relieve suffering under three circumstances. The first is when a painful injury or pathology is resistant to treatment and persists. The second is when pain persists after the injury or pathology has healed. Finally, the third circumstance is when medical science cannot identify the cause of pain. Treatment approaches to chronic pain include pharmacological measures, such as analgesics (pain killer drugs), antidepressants, and anticonvulsants; interventional procedures, physical therapy, physical exercise, application of ice or heat; and psychological measures, such as biofeedback and cognitive behavioral therapy. 

==Defining pain==
In the nursing profession, one common definition of pain is any problem that is &quot;whatever the experiencing person says it is, existing whenever the experiencing person says it does&quot;.

Pain management includes patient and communication about the pain problem. To define the pain problem, a health care provider will likely ask questions such as:
* How intense is the pain?
* How does the pain feel?
* Where is the pain?
* What, if anything, makes the pain lessen?
* What, if anything, makes the pain increase?
* When did the pain start?
After asking such questions, the health care provider will have a description of the pain. Pain management will then be used to address that pain.

==Adverse effects==
There are many types of pain management. Each have their own benefits, drawbacks, and limits.

A common challenge in pain management is communication between the health care provider and the person experiencing pain. People experiencing pain may have difficulty recognizing or describing what they feel and how intense it is. Health care providers and patients may have difficulty communicating with each other about how pain responds to treatments. There is a risk in many types of pain management for the patient to take treatment that is less effective than needed or which causes other difficulties and side effects. Some treatments for pain can be harmful if overused. A goal of pain management for the patient and their health care provider is to identify the amount of treatment needed to address the pain without going beyond that limit.

Another problem with pain management is that pain is the body&#x27;s natural way of communicating a problem. Pain is supposed to resolve as the body heals itself with time and pain management. Sometimes pain management covers a problem, and the patient might be less aware that they need treatment for a deeper problem.

== Physical approach ==

=== Physical medicine and rehabilitation ===
Physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&amp;R), a medical specialty, uses a range of physical techniques, such as heat and electrotherapy, as well as therapeutic exercises and behavioral therapy in the management of pain. PM&amp;R techniques are usually part of an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary program that might also include pharmaceuticals. Spa therapy has showed positive effects in reducing pain among patients with chronic low back pain, but its evidence base is limited. Studies have shown that kinesiotape can be used to reduce chronic low back pain. The US Centers for Disease Control recommended that physical therapy and exercise be prescribed as first-line treatments (rather than opioids) for multiple causes of chronic pain in 2016 guidelines. Applicable disorders include chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis of the hip and knee, and fibromyalgia. Exercise alone or with other rehabilitation disciplines (including psychotherapeutic approaches) can have a positive effects on pain. Besides improving the experience of pain itself, exercise can also improve individuals&#x27; well-being and general health.

Manipulative and mobilization therapies are considered safe interventions for low back pain, with manipulation potentially offering a larger therapeutic effect.

Specifically in chronic low back pain, education about the way the brain processes pain in conjunction with routine physiotherapy interventions may provide short-term relief of disability and pain.

=== Exercise interventions ===

Physical activity interventions, such as tai chi, yoga, and Pilates, promote harmony of the mind and body through total body awareness. These practices incorporate breathing techniques, meditation, and a wide variety of movements while training the body to perform functionally by increasing strength, flexibility, and range of motion. Physical activity can also benefit chronic sufferers by reducing inflammation and sensitivity and boosting overall energy. Physical activity and exercise may improve chronic pain (pain lasting more than 12 weeks), and overall quality of life, while minimizing the need for pain medications. More specifically, walking has been effective in improving pain management in chronic low back pain.

=== TENS ===

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a self-operated portable device intended to help regulate and control chronic pain via electrical impulses. Limited research has explored the effectiveness of TENS in relation to pain management of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic autoimmune neurological disorder, which consists of the demyelination of the nerve axons and the disruption of nerve conduction velocity and efficiency. In one study, electrodes were placed over the lumbar spine, and participants received treatment twice a day and at any time when they experienced a painful episode. This study found that TENS would benefit MS patients with localized or limited symptoms in one limb. The research is mixed with whether or not TENS helps manage pain in MS patients.

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is ineffective for lower back pain. However, it might help with diabetic neuropathy as well as other illnesses. 

==== tDCS ====
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive technique of brain stimulation that can modulate activity in specific brain cortex regions, and it involves the application of low-intensity (up to 2 mA) constant direct current to the scalp through electrodes in order to modulate the excitability of large cortical areas. tDCS may have a role in pain assessment by contributing to efforts in distinguishing between somatic and affective aspects of pain experience. Zaghi and colleagues (2011) found that the motor cortex, when stimulated with tDCS, increases the threshold for both the perception of non-painful and painful stimuli. Although there is a greater need for research examining the mechanism of electrical stimulation in pain treatment, one theory suggests that the changes in thalamic activity may be due to the influence of motor cortex stimulation on the decrease in pain sensations.

Concerning MS, a study found that daily tDCS sessions resulted in an individual&#x27;s subjective report of pain decreased when compared to a sham condition. In addition, the study found a similar improvement at 1 to 3 days before and after each tDCS session.

Fibromyalgia is a disorder in which an individual experiences dysfunctional brain activity, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness in localized areas. Research examining tDCS for pain treatment in fibromyalgia has found initial evidence for pain decreases. Specifically, the stimulation of the primary motor cortex resulted in significantly greater pain improvement in comparison to the control group (e.g., sham stimulation, stimulation of the DLPFC). However, this effect decreased after treatment ended, but remained significant for three weeks following the extinction of treatment.

=== Acupuncture ===
Acupuncture involves the insertion and manipulation of needles into specific points on the body to relieve pain or for therapeutic purposes. An analysis of the 13 highest quality studies of pain treatment with acupuncture, published in January 2009 in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, was unable to quantify the difference in the effect on pain of real, sham and no acupuncture. A systematic review in 2019 reported that acupuncture injection therapy was an effective treatment for patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain, and is widely used in Southeast Asian countries.

=== Light therapy ===
Research has found evidence that light therapy such as low level laser therapy is an effective therapy for relieving low back pain. Instead of thermal therapy, where reactant energy is originated through heat, Low-Level Light Therapy (LLLT) utilizes photochemical reactions requiring light to function. Photochemical reactions need light in order to function. Photons, the energy created from light, from these photochemical reactions provide the reactants with energy to embed in muscles, thus managing pain. One study conducted by Stausholm et al. showed that at certain wavelengths, LLLT reduced pain in participants with knee osteoarthritis. LLLT stimulates a variety of cell types, which in turn can help treat tendonitis, arthritis, and pain relating to muscles.

=== Sound therapy ===

Audioanalgesia and music therapy are both examples of using auditory stimuli to manage pain or other distress. They are generally viewed as insufficient when used alone but also as helpful adjuncts to other forms of therapy.

=== Interventional procedures ===

Interventional radiology procedures for pain control, typically used for chronic back pain, include epidural steroid injections, facet joint injections, neurolytic blocks, spinal cord stimulators and intrathecal drug delivery system implants.

Pulsed radiofrequency, neuromodulation, direct introduction of medication and nerve ablation may be used to target either the tissue structures and organ/systems responsible for persistent nociception or the nociceptors from the structures implicated as the source of chronic pain. Radiofrequency treatment has been seen to improve pain in patients with facet joint low back pain. However, continuous radiofrequency is more effective in managing pain than pulsed radiofrequency.

An intrathecal pump is sometimes used to deliver very small quantities of medications directly to the spinal fluid. This is similar to epidural infusions used in labour and postoperatively. The major differences are that it is much more common for the drug to be delivered into the spinal fluid (intrathecal) rather than epidurally, and the pump can be fully implanted under the skin. 

A spinal cord stimulator is an implantable medical device that creates electric impulses and applies them near the dorsal surface of the spinal cord, providing a paresthesia (&quot;tingling&quot;) sensation that alters the perception of pain by the patient.

=== Intra-articular ozone therapy ===
Intra-articular ozone therapy has been seen to alleviate chronic pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis efficiently.

== Psychological approach ==

=== Acceptance and commitment therapy ===
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy that focuses on behavior change rather than symptom change, includes methods designed to alter the context around psychological experiences rather than to alter the makeup of the experiences, and emphasizes the use of experiential behavior change methods. The central process in ACT revolves around psychological flexibility, which in turn includes processes of acceptance, awareness, a present-oriented quality in interacting with experiences, an ability to persist or change behavior, and an ability to be guided by one&#x27;s values. ACT has an increased evidence base for range of health and behavior problems, including chronic pain. ACT influences patients to adopt a tandem process to acceptance and change, which allows for a greater flexibility in the focus of treatment.

Recent research has applied ACT successfully to chronic pain in older adults due to in part of its direction from individual values and being highly customizable to any stage of life. In line with the therapeutic model of ACT, significant increases in process variables, pain acceptance, and mindfulness were also observed in a study applying ACT to chronic pain in older adults. In addition, these primary results suggested that an ACT based treatment may significantly improve levels of physical disability, psychosocial disability, and depression post-treatment and at a three-month follow-up for older adults with chronic pain.

===Cognitive behavioral therapy===
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps patients with pain to understand the relationship between their pain, thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. A main goal in treatment is cognitive (thinking, reasoning or remembering) restructuring to encourage helpful thought patterns. This will target healthy activities such as regular exercise and pacing. Lifestyle changes are also trained to improve sleep patterns and to develop better coping skills for pain and other stressors using various techniques (e.g., relaxation, diaphragmatic breathing, and even biofeedback).

Studies have demonstrated the usefulness of cognitive behavioral therapy in the management of chronic low back pain, producing significant decreases in physical and psychosocial disability. CBT is significantly more effective than standard care in treatment of people with body-wide pain, like fibromyalgia. Evidence for the usefulness of CBT in the management of adult chronic pain is generally poorly understood, due partly to the proliferation of techniques of doubtful quality, and the poor quality of reporting in clinical trials. The crucial content of individual interventions has not been isolated and the important contextual elements, such as therapist training and development of treatment manuals, have not been determined. The widely varying nature of the resulting data makes useful systematic review and meta-analysis within the field very difficult.

In 2020, a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the clinical effectiveness of psychological therapies for the management of adult chronic pain (excluding headaches). There is no evidence that behaviour therapy (BT) is effective for reducing this type of pain, however BT may be useful for improving a person&#x27;s mood immediately after treatment. This improvement appears to be small, and is short term in duration. CBT may have a small positive short-term effect on pain immediately following treatment. CBT may also have a small effect on reducing disability and potential catastrophizing that may be associated with adult chronic pain. These benefits do not appear to last very long following the therapy. CBT may contribute towards improving the mood of an adult who experiences chronic pain, which could possibility be maintained for longer periods of time.

For children and adolescents, a review of RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of psychological therapy for the management of chronic and recurrent pain found that psychological treatments are effective in reducing pain when people under 18 years old have headaches. This beneficial effect may be maintained for at least three months following the therapy. Psychological treatments may also improve pain control for children or adolescents who experience pain not related to headaches. It is not known if psychological therapy improves a child or adolescents mood and the potential for disability related to their chronic pain.

=== Hypnosis ===
A 2007 review of 13 studies found evidence for the efficacy of hypnosis in the reduction of pain in some conditions. However the studies had some limitations like small study sizes, bringing up issues of power to detect group differences, and lacking credible controls for placebo or expectation. The authors concluded that &quot;although the findings provide support for the general applicability of hypnosis in the treatment of chronic pain, considerably more research will be needed to fully determine the effects of hypnosis for different chronic-pain conditions.&quot;

Hypnosis has reduced the pain of some harmful medical procedures in children and adolescents. In clinical trials addressing other patient groups, it has significantly reduced pain compared to no treatment or some other non-hypnotic interventions. The effects of self hypnosis on chronic pain are roughly comparable to those of progressive muscle relaxation.

A 2019 systematic review of 85 studies showed it to be significantly effective at reducing pain for people with high and medium levels of suggestibility, but of minimal effectiveness for people with low suggestibility. However, high quality clinical data is needed to generalize to the whole chronic pain population.

=== Mindfulness meditation ===
A 2013 meta-analysis of studies that used techniques centered around the concept of mindfulness, concluded, &quot;that MBIs [mindfulness-based interventions] decrease the intensity of pain for chronic pain patients.&quot; A 2019 review of studies of brief mindfulness-based interventions (BMBI) concluded that BMBI are not recommended as a first-line treatment and could not confirm their efficacy in managing chronic or acute pain.

=== Mindfulness-based pain management ===
Mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM) is a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) providing specific applications for people living with chronic pain and illness. Adapting the core concepts and practices of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), MBPM includes a distinctive emphasis on the practice of &#x27;loving-kindness&#x27;, and has been seen as sensitive to concerns about removing mindfulness teaching from its original ethical framework within Buddhism. It was developed by Vidyamala Burch and is delivered through the programs of Breathworks. It has been subject to a range of clinical studies demonstrating its effectiveness.

== Medications ==
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a &quot;pain ladder&quot; for managing pain relief with pharmaceutical medicine. It was first described for use in cancer pain. However it can be used by medical professionals as a general principle when managing any type of pain. In the treatment of chronic pain, the three-step WHO Analgesic Ladder provides guidelines for selecting the appropriate medicine. The exact medications recommended will vary by country and the individual treatment center, but the following gives an example of the WHO approach to treating chronic pain with medications. If, at any point, treatment fails to provide adequate pain relief, then the doctor and patient move onto the next step.

=== Mild pain ===
Paracetamol (acetaminophen), or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen will relieve mild pain.

=== Mild to moderate pain ===
Paracetamol, an NSAID or paracetamol in a combination product with a weak opioid such as tramadol, may provide greater relief than their separate use. A combination of opioid with acetaminophen can be frequently used such as Percocet, Vicodin, or Norco. 

=== Moderate to severe pain ===
When treating moderate to severe pain, the type of the pain, acute or chronic, needs to be considered. The type of pain can result in different medications being prescribed. Certain medications may work better for acute pain, others for chronic pain, and some may work equally well on both. Acute pain medication is for rapid onset of pain such as from an inflicted trauma or to treat post-operative pain. Chronic pain medication is for alleviating long-lasting, ongoing pain.

Morphine is the gold standard to which all narcotics are compared. Semi-synthetic derivatives of morphine such as hydromorphone (Dilaudid), oxymorphone (Numorphan, Opana), nicomorphine (Vilan), hydromorphinol and others vary in such ways as duration of action, side effect profile and milligramme potency. Fentanyl has the benefit of less histamine release and thus fewer side effects. It can also be administered via transdermal patch which is convenient for chronic pain management. In addition to the intrathecal patch and injectable fentanyl formulations, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has approved various immediate release fentanyl products for breakthrough cancer pain (Actiq/OTFC/Fentora/Onsolis/Subsys/Lazanda/Abstral). Oxycodone is used across the Americas and Europe for relief of serious chronic pain. Its main slow-release formula is known as OxyContin. Short-acting tablets, capsules, syrups and ampules which contain oxycodone are available making it suitable for acute intractable pain or breakthrough pain. Diamorphine, and methadone are used less frequently. Clinical studies have shown that transdermal buprenorphine is effective at reducing chronic pain. Pethidine, known in North America as meperidine, is not recommended for pain management due to its low potency, short duration of action, and toxicity associated with repeated use. Pentazocine, dextromoramide and dipipanone are also not recommended in new patients except for acute pain where other analgesics are not tolerated or are inappropriate, for pharmacological and misuse-related reasons. In some countries potent synthetics such as piritramide and ketobemidone are used for severe pain. Tapentadol is a newer agent introduced in the last decade.

For moderate pain, tramadol, codeine, dihydrocodeine, and hydrocodone are used, with nicocodeine, ethylmorphine and propoxyphene or dextropropoxyphene (less commonly).

Drugs of other types can be used to help opioids combat certain types of pain. Amitriptyline is prescribed for chronic muscular pain in the arms, legs, neck and lower back with an opiate, or sometimes without it or with an NSAID.

While opiates are often used in the management of chronic pain, high doses are associated with an increased risk of opioid overdose.

=== Opioids ===

In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration stated: &quot;According to the National Institutes of Health, studies have shown that properly managed medical use of opioid analgesic compounds (taken exactly as prescribed) is safe, can manage pain effectively, and rarely causes addiction.&quot; In 2013, the FDA stated that &quot;abuse and misuse of these products have created a serious and growing public health problem&quot;.

Opioid medications can provide short, intermediate or long acting analgesia depending upon the specific properties of the medication and whether it is formulated as an extended release drug. Opioid medications may be administered orally, by injection, via nasal mucosa or oral mucosa, rectally, transdermally, intravenously, epidurally and intrathecally. In chronic pain conditions that are opioid responsive, a combination of a long-acting (OxyContin, MS Contin, Opana ER, Exalgo and Methadone) or extended release medication is often prescribed along with a shorter-acting medication (oxycodone, morphine or hydromorphone) for breakthrough pain, or exacerbations.

Most opioid treatment used by patients outside of healthcare settings is oral (tablet, capsule or liquid), but suppositories and skin patches can be prescribed. An opioid injection is rarely needed for patients with chronic pain.

Although opioids are strong analgesics, they do not provide complete analgesia regardless of whether the pain is acute or chronic in origin. Opioids are effective analgesics in chronic malignant pain and modestly effective in nonmalignant pain management. However, there are associated adverse effects, especially during the commencement or change in dose. When opioids are used for prolonged periods drug tolerance will occur. Other risks can include chemical dependency, diversion and addiction.

Clinical guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain have been issued by the American Pain Society and the American Academy of Pain Medicine. Included in these guidelines is the importance of assessing the patient for the risk of substance abuse, misuse, or addiction. Factors correlated with an elevated risk of opioid misuse include a history of substance use disorder, younger age, major depression, and the use of psychotropic medications. Physicians who prescribe opioids should integrate this treatment with any psychotherapeutic intervention the patient may be receiving. The guidelines also recommend monitoring not only the pain but also the level of functioning and the achievement of therapeutic goals. The prescribing physician should be suspicious of abuse when a patient reports a reduction in pain but has no accompanying improvement in function or progress in achieving identified goals.

The list below consists of commonly used opioid analgesics which have long-acting formulations. Common brand names for the extended release formulation are in parentheses.
* Oxycodone (OxyContin)
* Hydromorphone (Exalgo, Hydromorph Contin)
* Morphine (M-Eslon, MS Contin)
* Oxymorphone (Opana ER)
* Fentanyl, transdermal (Duragesic)
* Buprenorphine*, transdermal (Butrans)
* Tramadol (Ultram ER)
* Tapentadol (Nucynta ER)
* Methadone* (Metadol, Methadose)
* Hydrocodone bitartrate (Hysingla ER) and bicarbonate (Zohydro ER)
*Methadone and buprenorphine are each used both for the treatment of opioid addiction and as analgesics

=== Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ===
The other major group of analgesics are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). They work by inhibiting the release of prostaglandins, which cause inflammatory pain. Acetaminophen/paracetamol is not always included in this class of medications. However, acetaminophen may be administered as a single medication or in combination with other analgesics (both NSAIDs and opioids). The alternatively prescribed NSAIDs such as ketoprofen and piroxicam have limited benefit in chronic pain disorders and with long-term use are associated with significant adverse effects. The use of selective NSAIDs designated as selective COX-2 inhibitors have significant cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risks which have limited their utilization. Common NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. There are many NSAIDs such as parecoxib (selective COX-2 inhibitor) with proven effectiveness after different surgical procedures. Wide use of non-opioid analgesics can reduce opioid-induced side-effects.

=== Antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs ===
Some antidepressant and antiepileptic drugs are used in chronic pain management and act primarily within the pain pathways of the central nervous system, though peripheral mechanisms have been attributed as well. They are generally used to treat nerve brain that results from injury to the nervous system. Neuropathy can be due to chronic high blood sugar levels (diabetic neuropathy). These drugs also reduce pain from viruses such as shingles, phantom limb pain and post-stroke pain. These mechanisms vary and in general are more effective in neuropathic pain disorders as well as complex regional pain syndrome. A common anti-epileptic drug is gabapentin, and an example of an antidepressant would be amitriptyline.

=== Cannabinoids ===

Evidence of medical marijuana&#x27;s effect on reducing pain is generally conclusive. Detailed in a 1999 report by the Institute of Medicine, &quot;the available evidence from animal and human studies indicates that cannabinoids can have a substantial analgesic effect&quot;. In a 2013 review study published in &quot;Fundamental &amp; Clinical Pharmacology&quot;, various studies were cited in demonstrating that cannabinoids exhibit comparable effectiveness to opioids in models of acute pain and even greater effectiveness in models of chronic pain. It is mainly the THC strain of medical marijuana that provide analgesic benefits, as opposed to the CBD strain.

=== Ketamine ===
Low-dose ketamine is sometimes used as an alternative to opioids for the treatment of acute pain in hospital emergency departments. Ketamine probably? reduces pain more than opioids and with less nausea and vomiting.

=== Other analgesics ===
Other drugs which can potentiate conventional analgesics or have analgesic properties in certain circumstances are called analgesic adjuvant medications. Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant, can reduce neuropathic pain itself and can also potentiate opiates. Drugs with anticholinergic activity, such as orphenadrine and cyclobenzaprine, are given in conjunction with opioids for neuropathic pain. Orphenadrine and cyclobenzaprine are also muscle relaxants, and are useful in painful musculoskeletal conditions. Clonidine, an alpha-2 receptor agonist, is another drug that has found use as an analgesic adjuvant. In 2021, researchers described a novel type of pain therapy a CRISPR-dCas9 epigenome editing method for repressing Nav1.7 gene expression which showed therapeutic potential in three mouse models of chronic pain.

== Self-management ==
Self-management of chronic pain has been described as the individual&#x27;s ability to manage various aspects of their chronic pain. Self-management can include building self-efficacy, monitoring one&#x27;s own symptoms, goal setting and action planning. It also includes patient-physician shared decision-making, among others. The benefits of self-management vary depending on self-management techniques used. They only have marginal benefits in management of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Some research has shown that self-management of pain can use different approaches. Those approaches can range from different therapies such as yoga, acupuncture, exercise and other relaxation techniques. Patients could also take a more natural approach by taking different minerals, vitamins or herbs. However, research has shown there is a difference between rural patients and non-rural patients having more access to different self-management approaches. Physicians in these areas may be readily prescribing more pain medication in these rural cities due to being less experienced with pain management. Simply put, it is sometimes easier for rural patients to get a prescription that insurance pays for instead of natural approaches that cost more money than they can afford to spend on their pain management. Self-management may be a more expensive alternative.

==Society and culture==
The medical treatment of pain as practiced in Greece and Turkey is called algology (from the Greek άλγος, algos, &quot;pain&quot;). The Hellenic Society of Algology and the Turkish Algology-Pain Society are the relevant local bodies affiliated to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP).

=== Undertreatment ===

Undertreatment of pain is the absence of pain management therapy for a person in pain when treatment is indicated.

Consensus in evidence-based medicine and the recommendations of medical specialty organizations establish guidelines to determine the treatment for pain which health care providers ought to offer. For various social reasons, persons in pain may not seek or may not be able to access treatment for their pain. Health care providers may not provide the treatment which authorities recommend. Some studies about gender biases have concluded that female pain recipients are often overlooked when it comes to the perception of their pain. Whether they appeared to be in high levels of pain didn&#x27;t make a difference for their observers. The women participants in the studies were still &quot;perceived&quot; to be in less pain than they actually were. Men participants on the other hand were offered pain relief while their self reporting indicated that their pain levels didn&#x27;t necessarily warrant treatment. Biases exist when it comes to gender. Prescribers have been seen over and under prescribing treatment to individuals based on them being male or female .There are other prevalent reasons that undertreatment of pain occurs. Gender is a factor as well as race. When it comes to prescribers treating patients racial disparities has become a real factor. Research has shown that non-white individuals pain perception has affected their pain treatment. The African-American community has been shown to suffer significantly when it comes to trusting the medical community to treat them. Oftentimes medication although available to be prescribed is dispensed in less quantities due to their pain being perceived on a smaller scale. The black community could be undermined by physicians thinking they are not in as much pain as they are reporting. Another occurrence may be physicians simply making the choice not to treat the patient accordingly in spite of the self-reported pain level. Racial disparity is definitely a real issue in the world of pain management.

===In children===

Acute pain is common in children and adolescents as a result of injury, illness, or necessary medical procedures. Chronic pain is present in approximately 15–25% of children and adolescents. It may be caused by an underlying disease, such as sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis. Cancer or functional disorders such as migraines, fibromyalgia, and complex regional pain could also cause chronic pain in children.
Pain assessment in children is often challenging due to limitations in developmental level, cognitive ability, or their previous pain experiences. Clinicians must observe physiological and behavioral cues exhibited by the child to make an assessment. Self-report, if possible, is the most accurate measure of pain. Self-report pain scales involve younger kids matching their pain intensity to photographs of other children&#x27;s faces, such as the Oucher Scale, pointing to schematics of faces showing different pain levels, or pointing out the location of pain on a body outline. Questionnaires for older children and adolescents include the Varni-Thompson Pediatric Pain Questionnaire (PPQ) and the Children&#x27;s Comprehensive Pain Questionnaire. They are often utilized for individuals with chronic or persistent pain.

Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and opioid analgesics are commonly used to treat acute or chronic pain symptoms in children and adolescents. However a pediatrician should be consulted before administering any medication.

Caregivers may provide nonpharmacological treatment for children and adolescents because it carries minimal risk and is cost effective compared to pharmacological treatment. Nonpharmacologic interventions vary by age and developmental factors. Physical interventions to ease pain in infants include swaddling, rocking, or sucrose via a pacifier. For children and adolescents physical interventions include hot or cold application, massage, or acupuncture. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) aims to reduce the emotional distress and improve the daily functioning of school-aged children and adolescents with pain by changing the relationship between their thoughts and emotions. In addition this therapy teaches them adaptive coping strategies. Integrated interventions in CBT include relaxation technique, mindfulness, biofeedback, and acceptance (in the case of chronic pain). Many therapists will hold sessions for caregivers to provide them with effective management strategies.

In red-haired individuals

In recent studies, it has been noted that people who have red-hair through the MC1R receptor gene may react to opioids and perceive pain differently than the rest of the population. The studies on this developing topic have only become notable in the past few years with researchers looking into how red-haired individuals may experience a different threshold in pain and react to pain management differently than others. Most studies find that redheads with this gene have a higher pain tolerance and can also react more sensitively to opiates but require more anesthesia. 

===Professional certification===
Pain management practitioners come from all fields of medicine. In addition to medical practitioners, a pain management team may often benefit from the input of pharmacists, physiotherapists, clinical psychologists and occupational therapists, among others. Together the multidisciplinary team can help create a package of care suitable to the patient.

==== Pain medicine in the United States ====
Pain physicians are often fellowship-trained board-certified anesthesiologists, neurologists, physiatrists, emergency physicians, or psychiatrists. Palliative care doctors are also specialists in pain management. The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, the American Board of Anesthesiology, the American Osteopathic Board of Anesthesiology (recognized by the AOABOS), the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, the American Board of Emergency Medicine and the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology each provide certification for a subspecialty in pain management following fellowship training. The fellowship training is recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) or the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists (AOABOS). As the field of pain medicine has grown rapidly, many practitioners have entered the field, some non-ACGME board-certified.

<text>Hindustan Motors is an Indian automotive manufacturer based in Kolkata. It is a part of the Birla Technical Services conglomerate. Hindustan Motors was the largest car manufacturer in India before the rise of Maruti Udyog. Hindustan Motors manufactured the Ambassador and Landmaster motorcars (based on 1956 Morris Oxford Series III), both immensely popular Indian automobiles from 1957 to 2014.

One of the original three car manufacturers in India, founded in 1942 by Mr. B.M. Birla, it was a leader in car sales until the 1980s, when the industry was opened up from protection. Manoj Jha was the managing director who stepped down from the post on 21 February 2012.

On 11 February 2017, Hindustan Motors executed an agreement with Peugeot SA for the sale of the Ambassador brand, including the trademarks, for a consideration of ₹80 crore. The tie-up entails two joint venture agreements between the companies of the two groups. The new Ambassador model was likely to be rolled out in December 2024.

== History ==

Hindustan Motors Limited (HML) was India&#x27;s pioneering automobile manufacturing company. It was established just before the Indian Independence Act 1947, in 1942 by B. M. Birla of the industrialist Birla family in collaboration with Lord Nuffield of Morris Motors, who were already selling their cars in India. Commencing operations in a small assembly plant in Port Okha near Gujarat, the manufacturing facilities later moved to Uttarpara, West Bengal in 1948, where it began the production of the Morris-designed Hindustan Ambassador. The HM-Mitsubishi Motors Plant is in Tiruvallur near Chennai in Tamil Nadu.

In 1948, after independence, vehicle production was shifted to a new greenfield plant spread over a large area in Uttarpara, West Bengal. The first car to roll out from the Uttarpara plant was the Hindustan 10, based on the Morris 10. Later the Hindustan 14, based on the Morris Oxford MO, and baby Hindustan, based on the Morris minor, were produced. In 1954 Hindustan launched the Morris Oxford Series II-derived Hindustan Landmaster, and in 1957 the Hindustan Ambassador, based on the Morris Oxford Series III, was launched. This first model, later known as Mark-1, whose basic design remained unchanged was manufactured until 2014 with various model changes on facelifts, engines and later with power steering, disc brakes, etc.

=== General Motors joint venture ===
Hindustan and General Motors have had several tie-ups in the post independence era to produce Bedford Trucks, Vauxhall Motors (1980 to 1990), Allison Transmissions and off-road equipment. In 1994, GM and Hindustan (C K Birla) formed a 50-50 joint venture, General Motors India to manufacture Opel Astra cars in the newly created mid-segment category. The production of the Astra was phased out and later replaced by the then successful Opel Corsa family of vehicles. In early 1999 General Motors India bought out the Halol, Gujarat, plant from Hindustan Motors thus ending a long partnership.

On 21 February 2012, Mr. Manoj Jha, the managing director stepped down from his post. The decision was unanimously accepted by the board of directors.

=== Earthmoving Equipment Division (HMEED) ===
Hindustan motors used to make earthmovers, initially in collaboration with Terex (US) and Fermac (UK); and beginning in 1984 with Caterpillar Inc. at the HMEED plants in Thiruvallur, near Chennai and Puducherry. The operation was sold to Caterpillar in 2000 and HM quit the earthmover business. HML continue to be a joint venture partner with Caterpillar in Hindustan Power Plus, which manufactures diesel engines and generator sets.

=== Hindustan Tractors ===
The company began in 1959 as Tractors and Bulldozers Private Ltd and imported tractors. Manufacturing of tractors began in 1963, in collaboration Motokov-Praha (Zetor) of Czechoslovakia, and was known as Hindustan Tractors &amp; Bulldozers Ltd. In 1967, it became Hindustan Tractors Ltd. The tractors were based on the Zetor tractor design and sold under the Hindustan brand. In 1978, the Gujarat, Indian government formed Gujarat Tractors from the ailing company. In 1999, Mahindra Tractors purchased 60% of the company, and in 2001, completed purchasing the rest of the company, renaming it Mahindra Gujarat Tractors Ltd.

=== Isuzu joint venture ===
In 1982 Hindustan formed a collaboration with Isuzu to assemble and sell the Isuzu F series - JCS trucks in India. These trucks came from the factory with a fully built modern metal cabin which was not common with Tata and Ashok Leyland trucks at the time. They were well known for their reliability and fuel consumption, but were discontinued mainly due to falling sales, poor service facilities, and HML not being able to sell them for an affordable price.

Hindustan Motors also entered into a technical collaboration to manufacture engines and transmissions for the Contessa in the late 1980s at a newly constructed state of the art engine plant at Pithampur near Indore, Madhya Pradesh. The petrol engine commonly known as Isuzu 1.8 Petrol would later serve in the Hindustan Ambassador with Multi Point Fuel Injection until 2015. Initially the joint venture produced 4-cylinder G180Z 1.8L petrol engines and 5-speed transmissions. Later, an 2.0L Isuzu diesel engine was added to the production line to power the Contessa and the Ambassador. The technical collaboration lasted from 1983 to 1993. The Indore plant has since expanded to manufacture engines for a number of other manufacturers like Opel, Ford and Mahindra.

=== Mitsubishi joint venture ===
Hindustan has a joint venture with Mitsubishi that began in 1998. The plant is located in Thiruvallur, Tamil Nadu. In India, Mitsubishi offered the Pajero, Lancer and Outlander with mild refreshes until early 2010s, but as time went by, their sales trended down. 
Mitsubishi launched Pajero Sport in 2012 with a 2.5l DI-D Variable Geometrical Turbo Diesel engine mated to a 5-speed AT (in 2WD only) or MT (in 4X4 only). Montero was also offered for a brief duration. Mitsubishi also launched the latest generation Outlander in 2018. The Lancer Evolution X was launched in India in 2013 as a CBU import, but it did not sell well in India due to the high price of ₹50 lakh.

<text>Pokémon Red Version and Pokémon Blue Version are 1996 role-playing video games (RPGs) developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy. They are the first installments of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video game series, and were first released in Japan as and followed by the special edition later that year. The games were released internationally in 1998 and 1999 as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Blue&quot;, while an enhanced version named was released in Japan in 1998 and in other regions in 1999 and 2000.

The player controls the protagonist from an overhead perspective and navigates the fictional region of Kanto in a quest to master Pokémon battling. The goal is to become the champion of the Indigo League by defeating the eight Gym Leaders and the top Pokémon trainers in the land, the Elite Four. Another objective is to complete the Pokédex, an in-game encyclopedia, by obtaining all 151 Pokémon. &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; use the Game Link Cable, which connects two Game Boy systems and allows Pokémon to be traded or battled between games. Both versions feature the same plot, and while they can be played separately, players must trade between both games to obtain all of the original 151 Pokémon.

&quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; were well-received, with critics praising the multiplayer options, especially the concept of trading. They received an aggregated score of 89% on GameRankings and are considered among the greatest games ever made, perennially ranked on top game lists including at least four years on &quot;IGN&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;. The games marked the beginning of a multibillion-dollar franchise, jointly selling over 400 million copies worldwide. The &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; versions were remade for Game Boy Advance as &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; (2004) while &quot;Yellow&quot; was remade for Nintendo Switch as &quot;Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu!&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot; (2018). The originals were rereleased on the Virtual Console service for Nintendo 3DS in 2016 to commemorate their twentieth anniversaries.

== Gameplay ==


&quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; are played in a third-person view, overhead perspective and consist of three basic screens: an overworld, in which the player navigates the main character; a side-view battle screen; and a menu interface, in which the player may configure their Pokémon, items, or gameplay settings.

The player can use their Pokémon to battle other Pokémon. When the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the two engaged Pokémon. During a battle, the player may choose to fight using one of four moves, use an item, switch the active Pokémon, or attempt to flee; however, fleeing is not possible in trainer battles. Pokémon have hit points (HP); when a Pokémon&#x27;s HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pokémon faints, the player&#x27;s Pokémon that were involved in the battle receive a certain number of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon will level up. A Pokémon&#x27;s level controls its physical properties, such as the battle statistics acquired, and the moves it has learned. Some Pokémon may also evolve at certain levels. These evolutions affect the statistics and the levels at which new moves are learned. Pokémon at higher stages of evolution gain more statistics each time they level up, although they may not learn new moves as early, if at all, compared with the lower stages of evolution.

Catching Pokémon is another essential element. While battling with a wild Pokémon, the player may throw a Poké Ball at it. If the Pokémon is successfully caught, it will come under the player&#x27;s ownership. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon, whether it is under a status effect, and the type of Poké Ball used: the lower the target&#x27;s HP, and the stronger the status effect and type of Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture. The ultimate goal is to complete the entries in the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 151 creatures.

&quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; allow players to trade Pokémon between two cartridges via a Game Link Cable. This method of trading must be done to fully complete the Pokédex since certain Pokémon will only evolve upon being traded and each of the two games have version-exclusive Pokémon. The Link Cable also makes it possible to battle another player&#x27;s Pokémon team. When playing &quot;Red&quot; or &quot;Blue&quot; on a Game Boy Advance or SP, the standard GBA/SP link cable will not work; players must use the Nintendo Universal Game Link Cable instead. Moreover, the English versions are incompatible with their Japanese counterparts, and such trades will corrupt the save files, as the games use different languages and therefore character sets.

As well as trading with each other and &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; can trade Pokémon with the second generation of Pokémon games: &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot;, &quot;Silver&quot;, and &quot;Crystal&quot;. However, there are limitations: the games cannot link if one player&#x27;s party contains Pokémon or moves introduced in the second generation games. Also, using the Transfer Pak for the Nintendo 64, data such as Pokémon and items from &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; can be used in the Nintendo 64 games &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot;. &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; are incompatible with the &quot;Pokémon&quot; games of the later &quot;Advanced Generation&quot; for the Game Boy Advance and GameCube.

=== Bugs and glitches ===

&quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; are notable for a large quantity of glitches, possibly due to their scope in comparison to Game Freak&#x27;s development experience at the time. One of the most popular glitches in &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; involves encountering MissingNo. (short for &quot;Missing Number&quot;), a glitch Pokémon with multiple forms that arise when different glitches are performed. Additionally, several other Pokémon can be encountered using glitches, such as the otherwise-unobtainable Mythical Pokémon Mew. Another glitch, dubbed the &quot;EXP underflow glitch&quot;, allows players to manipulate unsigned integers in the game&#x27;s code for Pokémon in the &quot;medium slow&quot; experience group in order to max out the level of any such Pokémon.

== Plot ==
=== Story ===
The player begins in their hometown of Pallet Town in the Kanto region. After venturing alone into the tall grass, the player is stopped by Professor Samuel Oak, a famous Pokémon Researcher. Professor Oak explains to the player that wild Pokémon may be living there and encountering them alone can be very dangerous. He takes the player to his laboratory where the player meets Oak&#x27;s grandson, a rival aspiring Pokémon Trainer. The player and the rival are both instructed to select a starter Pokémon for their travels out of Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Charmander. Oak&#x27;s grandson will always choose the Pokémon which is stronger against the player&#x27;s starting Pokémon. He will then challenge the player to a Pokémon battle with their newly obtained Pokémon and will continue to battle the player at certain points.

While visiting the region&#x27;s cities, the player will encounter special establishments called Gyms. Inside these buildings are Gym Leaders, each of whom the player must defeat in a Pokémon battle to obtain a total of eight Gym Badges. Once the badges are acquired, the player is given permission to enter the Kanto League in the Indigo Plateau, which consists of the best Pokémon Trainers in the region. There the player will battle the Elite Four and finally the new Kanto League Champion: the player&#x27;s rival. Throughout, the player battles Team Rocket, a criminal organization that uses the Pokémon for various crimes. They devise numerous plans for stealing rare Pokémon, which the player must foil.

=== Setting ===
&quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; take place in the region of Kanto, which is based on the real-life Kantō region in Japan. This is one distinct region, as shown in later games, with different geographical habitats for the 151 existing Pokémon species, along with human-populated towns and cities and Routes connecting locations with one another. Some areas are only accessible once the player learns a special ability or gains a special item. Kanto has multiple settlements: Pallet Town, Viridian City, Pewter City, Cerulean City, Vermillion City, Lavender Town, Celadon City, Fuchsia City, Saffron City, Cinnabar Island, and the Indigo Plateau. All of these other than Pallet Town, Lavender Town, and Indigo Plateau have a gym with a leader who serves as a boss, and the battles against the Elite Four and final rival battle occur at Indigo Plateau. Areas in which the player can catch Pokémon range from caves (such as Mt. Moon, Rock Tunnel, Seafoam Islands, and Cerulean Cave) to the sea, where the kinds of Pokémon available to catch varies. For example, Tentacool can only be caught either through fishing or when the player is in a body of water, while Zubat can only be caught in a cave.

== Development ==
The game developer, Satoshi Tajiri, pitched the concept of Pokémon to Nintendo&#x27;s staff in 1990 and was met with skepticism. They believed his ideas were too ambitious and found it difficult to see the appeal. However, Shigeru Miyamoto saw great potential in the idea and convinced the company to go ahead with the project.

The initial concept for &quot;Pokémon&quot; stemmed from the hobby of insect collecting, a popular pastime which Tajiri enjoyed as a child. While growing up, however, he observed more urbanization taking place in the town where he lived and as a result, the insect population declined. Tajiri noticed that kids now played in their homes instead of outside and he came up with the idea of a video game, containing creatures that resembled insects, called Pokémon. He thought kids could relate with the Pokémon by individually naming them, and then controlling them to represent fear or anger as a good way of relieving stress. However, Pokémon never bleed nor die in battle, only faint – this was a very touchy subject to Tajiri, as he did not want to further fill the gaming world with &quot;pointless violence&quot;.

The concept of trading Pokémon was inspired by a frustrating experience Tajiri had while playing &quot;Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line&quot;. Tajiri was attempting to obtain an item that could only be obtained by a rare drop from an enemy, but he was not able to acquire it. Ken Sugimori was also playing &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; at the time and was able to acquire two of the rare item. Wishing to obtain Sugimori&#x27;s extra copy, Tajiri attempted to figure out if it was possible to trade items between games, but realized this was not possible on the Famicom. When the Game Boy was released, Tajiri thought the system was perfect for his idea, especially because of the link cable, which he envisioned would allow players to trade Pokémon with each other. This concept of trading information was new to the video game industry because previously connection cables were only being used for competition. &quot;I imagined a chunk of information being transferred by connecting two Game Boys with special cables, and I went wow, that&#x27;s really going to be something!&quot; said Tajiri. Upon hearing of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; concept, Shigeru Miyamoto suggested creating multiple cartridges with different Pokémon in each, noting it would assist the trading aspect. Tajiri was also influenced by Square&#x27;s Game Boy game &quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot;, which he said gave him the idea that more than just action games could be developed for Game Boy.

The main characters were named after Tajiri himself as Satoshi, who is described as Tajiri in his youth, and his long-time friend, role model, mentor, and fellow Nintendo developer, Shigeru Miyamoto, as Shigeru. Ken Sugimori, an artist and longtime friend of Tajiri, headed the development of drawings and designs of the Pokémon, working with a team of fewer than ten people who conceived the various designs for all 151 Pokémon. Atsuko Nishida created the designs for Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, and many others. Sugimori, in turn, finalized each design, drawing the Pokémon from various angles in order to assist Game Freak&#x27;s graphics department in properly rendering the creature.

Originally called &quot;Capsule Monsters&quot;, the title went through several transitions due to trademark problems, becoming &quot;CapuMon&quot; and &quot;KapuMon&quot; before eventually settling upon &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot;. Tajiri always thought that Nintendo would reject his game, as the company did not really understand the concept at first. However, the games turned out to be a success, something Tajiri and Nintendo never expected, especially because of the declining popularity of the Game Boy.

Tajiri said that the Poké Ball concept was inspired by Ultraseven&#x27;s Capsule Monsters from the tokusatsu superhero television series &quot;Ultraseven&quot; (1967–1968). Nintendo spent $13 million marketing Pokémon Red and Blue in the United States.

=== Music ===
The game&#x27;s music was composed by Junichi Masuda, who used the four sound channels of the Game Boy to create both the melodies and the sound effects and Pokémon &quot;cries&quot; heard upon encountering them. He composed the opening theme, &quot;Monster&quot;, with battle scenes in mind, using white noise to sound like marching music and imitate a snare drum. Masuda wrote the music at his home on a Commodore Amiga computer, which only features PCM sample playback and converted to the Game Boy with a program he had written.

== Release ==
In Japan, &quot;Pocket Monsters Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; were the first versions released. Development was completed by October 1995 and release was originally planned for December 21, 1995, but was delayed until February 27, 1996 because the derivative products were not yet ready for sale. After a slow start they continued to sell well. Several months later, &quot;Pocket Monsters Blue&quot; was released in Japan as a mail-order-only special edition to subscribers of &quot;CoroCoro Comic&quot; on October 15, 1996. It was later released to general retail on October 10, 1999. It features updated in-game artwork and new dialogue. Using Blastoise as its mascot, the code, script, and artwork for &quot;Blue&quot; were used for the international releases of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;, which were renamed to &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. The Japanese &quot;Blue&quot; edition features all but a handful of Pokémon available in &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;, making certain Pokémon exclusive to the original editions.

To create more interest, Tajiri revealed an extra Pokémon called Mew hidden within them, which he believed &quot;created a lot of rumors and myths about the game&quot; and &quot;kept the interest alive&quot;. The creature was originally added by Shigeki Morimoto as an internal prank and was not intended to be exposed to consumers. It was not until later that Nintendo decided to distribute Mew through a Nintendo promotional event. However, in 2003 a glitch was discovered which allowed players to obtain Mew without relying on official Nintendo events.

During the North American localization of &quot;Pokémon&quot;, a small team led by Hiro Nakamura went through the individual Pokémon, renaming them for western audiences based on their appearance and characteristics after approval from Nintendo. In addition, during this process, Nintendo trademarked the 151 Pokémon names in order to ensure they would be unique to the franchise. During the translation process, it became apparent that simply altering the text from Japanese to English was impossible; the games had to be entirely reprogrammed from scratch due to the fragile state of their source code, a side effect of the unusually lengthy development time. Therefore, the games were based on the more modern Japanese version of &quot;Blue&quot;; modeling its programming and artwork after &quot;Blue&quot;, but keeping the same distribution of Pokémon found in the Japanese &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; cartridges.

As the finished &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; versions were being prepared for release, Nintendo allegedly spent over 50 million dollars on promotion, fearing the series would not be appealing to American children. The western localization team warned that the &quot;cute monsters&quot; may not be accepted by American audiences, and instead recommended they be redesigned and &quot;beefed-up&quot;. Then-president of Nintendo Hiroshi Yamauchi refused and instead viewed the games&#x27; possible reception in America as a challenge to face. Despite these setbacks, the reprogrammed &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; versions with their original creature designs were eventually released in North America on September 28, 1998, over two and a half years after &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; debuted in Japan. The games were received extremely well by the foreign audiences and &quot;Pokémon&quot; went on to become a lucrative franchise in America. The same versions were later released in Australia sometime later in 1998 and in Europe on October 5, 1999 being the second-to-last video game released for the original Game Boy in Europe with &quot;Pokemon Yellow Version: Special Pikachu Edition&quot; being the last.

=== &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; ===
Two years after &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;, Nintendo released Pokémon Yellow, an enhanced version of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, in Japan in 1998, and in North America and Europe in 1999 and 2000. The game was designed to resemble the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime series, with the player receiving a Pikachu as their starter Pokémon and their rival starting with an Eevee. Some non-player characters resemble those from the anime, including Team Rocket&#x27;s Jessie and James.

&quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; changes and enhances several aspects of the original games. Pikachu is provided as the player&#x27;s only starter Pokémon and has a voice and a personality unique from other Pokémon. It follows the player on the overworld, and the player can speak to it. Pikachu can grow to love or hate the player based on their actions; leveling up will keep Pikachu happy, while fainting frequently will make it unhappy. This feature was used again in &quot;Pokémon HeartGold&quot; and &quot;SoulSilver&quot;, the remakes of &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu!&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot;, the remakes of &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot;. &quot;Yellow&quot; includes a &quot;Pikachu&#x27;s Beach&quot; minigame that is only accessible to players who either won a Nintendo contest or complete a challenge in another game, &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot;, and exchange data between the games using the Transfer Pak. &quot;Yellow&quot; has slightly improved graphics and can print Pokédex entries onto stickers using the Game Boy Printer.

&quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; was developed by Game Freak and entered development after the completion of the Japanese version of &quot;Pokémon Blue&quot;. Nintendo may have been considering a &quot;Pokémon Pink&quot; version of &quot;Yellow&quot;, based on source code leaked from Nintendo.

&quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot;″s release coincided with the release of &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot; and was first announced as in Japan. Future Nintendo president Satoru Iwata later said that people likely felt &quot;Yellow&quot; would be unnecessary due to the release of &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; later that year. It was released in Japan on September 12, 1998, in Australia on September 3, 1999, in North America on October 19, 1999, and in Europe on June 16, 2000. A Pikachu-themed Game Boy Color bundle was released in North America in October 1999. To promote the release of &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot;, Volkswagen and Nintendo created a yellow Volkswagen New Beetle with features inspired by Pikachu. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; listed &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; as one of the notable handheld releases in 1999.

=== Re-releases ===
On the 20th anniversary of the first generation &quot;Pokémon&quot; games&#x27; Japanese release, in February 2016, Nintendo re-released &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow&quot; for their Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console service. The games include a first for the Virtual Console: simulated Link Cable functionality to allow trading and battling between games. As was the case with its original release, &quot;Green&quot; is exclusive to Japanese consumers. These versions can transfer Pokémon to &quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot; via the &quot;Pokémon Bank&quot; application.

A special Nintendo 2DS bundle was released in Japan, Europe, and Australia on February 27, 2016, with each console matching the corresponding color of the game version. North America received a special New Nintendo 3DS bundle with cover plates styled after &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;″s box art. By March 31, 2016, combined sales of the re-releases reached 1.5 million copies, with more than half sold in North America.

== Reception ==
The games received mostly positive reviews, holding an aggregate score of 88% on GameRankings. Special praise was given to its multiplayer features: the ability to trade and battle Pokémon with one another. Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; gave the games a &quot;masterful&quot; 10 out of 10, noting that: &quot;Even if you finish the quest, you still might not have all the Pokémon in the game. The challenge to catch &#x27;em all is truly the game&#x27;s biggest draw.&quot; He also commented on the popularity, especially among children, describing it as a &quot;craze&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Peter Bartholow, who gave the games a &quot;great&quot; 8.8 out of 10, cited the graphics and audio as somewhat primitive but stated that these were the only drawbacks. He praised the replay value due to their customization and variety and commented upon their universal appeal: &quot;Under its cuddly exterior, &quot;Pokémon&quot; is a serious and unique RPG with lots of depth and excellent multiplayer extensions. As an RPG, the game is accessible enough for newcomers to the genre to enjoy, but it will entertain hard-core fans as well. It&#x27;s easily one of the best Game Boy games to date&quot;.

The success of these games has been attributed to their innovative gaming experience rather than audiovisual effects. Papers published until 1999 by the Columbia Business School indicate both American and Japanese children prefer the actual gameplay of a game over special audio or visual effects. In &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, the lack of these artificial effects has actually been said to promote the child&#x27;s imagination and creativity. &quot;With all the talk of game engines and texture mapping and so on, there is something refreshing about this superlative gameplay which makes you ignore the cutesy 8-bit graphics&quot; commented &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

During the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Pokémon Red and Blue&quot; won the award for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Character or Story Development&quot;, along with receiving nominations for &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Console Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Interactive Design&quot;.

=== &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; ===
&quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; has been well received by critics, holding an aggregate score of 85% from GameRankings as their fifth highest-rated Game Boy game of all time. The &quot;Sarasota Herald-Tribune&quot; recommended &quot;Yellow&quot; as a good game for children. RPGFan called it &quot;so revoltingly addictive that any player of it has no choice but to &#x27;catch &#x27;em all&#x27;&quot;. They also called &quot;Yellow&quot; &quot;insulting&quot; in how limited the additions from &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; were. Giving the game a perfect score, &quot;IGN&quot;″s Craig Harris praised the mechanics, commenting that &quot;Yellow&quot; was the best game of the three to start with.

&quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Cameron Davis called it a &quot;stopgap&quot; to appease players until the release of &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, commenting that &quot;the new challenges are enough to fill the hole – but only just&quot;. &quot;GameDaily&quot;″s Chris Buffa listed it as one of the best &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, commenting that while it was a rehash, there was enough that was new to warrant playing. &quot;Allgame&quot;″s Brad Cook commented that for those who did not play &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot; was good; but otherwise, he advised that they wait until &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s Steve Boxer commented that while it had good gameplay mechanics, it was held back by the lack of features. He described Nintendo&#x27;s actions as avaricious, commenting that &quot;Yellow&quot; &quot;marks the point where Pokémon ceases to become a game and becomes a marketing exercise/obsession-satisfier&quot;.

&quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; received two nominations, &quot;Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot;, during the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

=== Sales ===
&quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; set the precedent for what has become a blockbuster, multibillion-dollar franchise. In Japan &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, and &quot;Blue&quot; sold 1.04 million units combined during 1996, and another 3.65 million in 1997. The latter performance made &quot;Pokémon&quot;, collectively, the country&#x27;s best-selling game of the year, surpassing &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. By 1997, about units had been sold in Japan. In 1998, &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Green&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; sold 1,739,391 units in Japan.

The video games were accompanied by the Pokémon Trading Card Game; both the video games and card game grossed combined sales revenue of more than in Japan, .

In the United States, it became the fastest-selling Game Boy game, having sold 200,000 copies within two weeks and units by the end of 1998. It went on to become the best-selling video game of 1999 in the United States, where copies were sold that year. By 2007, it had total combined sales of 9.85 million in the United States. In Europe, the games had grossed € or in 1999. In France, over copies were sold within a year. In Germany, they became the first video games to receive two Special Prize awards from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) for sales above copies by early 2001. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; received two Platinum awards for sales above 600,000 copies.

Worldwide sales reached over 31 million copies sold. It was &quot;the most successful computer game of all time&quot; according to Joseph Tobin in 2004. In 2009, &quot;IGN&quot; referred to &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; as the &quot;Best-selling RPG on the Game Boy&quot; and &quot;Best-selling RPG of all time&quot;, while in 2017, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; declared the games the &quot;Best-selling videogame (excluding bundle sales).&quot;

==== &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; ====
In Japan, the game sold 1,549,000 units in 1998, making it the third-best-selling video game of 1998 in Japan.

Before its release in North America, Nintendo anticipated that it would make them $75 million in the 1999 holiday season. The &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; Game Boy Color bundle was predicted to be the second-most popular toy of the holiday season. In North America the game received roughly 150,000 pre-orders. The bundle debuted at #2 in video game sales and claimed the #1 spot a week later. The standard cartridge sold over 600,000 units in its first week and one million copies within ten days, becoming the fastest-selling handheld game of all time when it was released. &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot;, a film released around the same time as &quot;Yellow&quot;, was expected to give it a sales boost. A Nintendo spokesman attributed the high demand for the Game Boy Color during the Christmas season of 1999 to &quot;Yellow&quot;. For the month of December, &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; led &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; and &quot;Gran Turismo 2&quot; on the monthly chart.

Gwenn Friss of the &quot;Cape Cod Times&quot; called it one of the hottest items of the 1999 Christmas season, comparing it to popular Christmas toys from previous years such as Furby and Tickle me Elmo. Thomas Content of &quot;USA Today&quot; reiterated the comparison, commenting that it was &quot;poised to stomp&quot; them. He added that it, along with &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, were responsible for the boost of Game Boy sales from 3.5 million in 1998 to 8 million in 1999. &quot;The Idaho Statesman&quot; called it the &quot;hottest new title for the Game Boy Color&quot;. &quot;Yellow&quot; was the third best-selling video game in North America in 1999, with the other four top spots occupied by other &quot;Pokémon&quot; games. The demand for &quot;Yellow&quot; resulted in Target to issue an apology for not being able to meet the &quot;unprecedented demand&quot;. CNET-surveyed stores sold out of &quot;Yellow&quot;. A spokesperson for FuncoLand attributed a drop in sales to shortages of both the Game Boy Color and &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot;.

For its European launch, units were shipped across the continent during June 2000, including 500,000 in the United Kingdom. &quot;Yellow&quot; became the fastest-selling &quot;Pokémon&quot; games in the United Kingdom, where it received a Double Platinum award from ELSPA for more than 600,000 sales and grossed more than or . In Germany, &quot;Yellow&quot; received a Double Platinum award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) for sales above 400,000 copies by early 2001.

== Legacy ==

The video game website &quot;1UP.com&quot; composed a list of the &quot;Top 5 &#x27;Late to the Party&#x27; Games&quot; showing selected games that &quot;prove a gaming platform&#x27;s untapped potential&quot; and were one of the last games released for their respective console. &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; were ranked first and called Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;secret weapon&quot; when they were released for the Game Boy in the late 1990s. The success revitalized the Game Boy in the late 1990s. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; listed the &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; versions together as the third best video game for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color, stating that something kept them playing until they caught every Pokémon. &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Ben Reeves called them (along with &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot;, &quot;Gold&quot;, &quot;Silver&quot;, and &quot;Crystal&quot;) the second best Game Boy games and stated that it had more depth than it appeared. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; named them one of the best Nintendo games of all time, placing 52nd on their list of the top 100 games. &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; made number 72 on &quot;IGN&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; in 2003, in which the reviewers noted that the pair of games &quot;started a revolution&quot; and praised the deep game design and complex strategy, as well the option to trade between other games. Two years later, it climbed to number 70 in the updated list, with the games&#x27; legacy again noted to have inspired multiple video game sequels, movies, television shows, and other merchandise, strongly rooting it in popular culture. In 2019, PC Magazine included the games on their &quot;The 10 Best Game Boy Games&quot;. In 2023, Time Extension included the game on their &quot;Best JRPGs of All Time&quot; list. In 2007, &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; were ranked at number 37 on the list, and the reviewers remarked on their longevity:

The games are widely credited with starting and helping pave the way for the successful multibillion-dollar series. Five years after &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;&#x27;s initial release, Nintendo celebrated its &quot;Pokémonniversary&quot;. George Harrison, the senior vice president of marketing and corporate communications of Nintendo of America, stated that &quot;those precious gems [&quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;] have evolved into &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. The release of &quot;Pokémon Pinball&quot; kicks off a line of great new Pokémon adventures that will be introduced in the coming months&quot;. The series has since sold over 300 million games, all accredited to the enormous success of the original &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; versions.

On February 12, 2014, an anonymous Australian programmer launched Twitch Plays &quot;Pokémon&quot;, a &quot;social experiment&quot; on the video streaming website Twitch. The project was a crowdsourced attempt to play a modified version of &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; by typing commands into the channel&#x27;s chat log, with an average of 50,000 viewers participating at the same time. The result was compared to &quot;watching a car crash in slow motion&quot;. The game was completed on March 1, 2014, boasting 390 hours of multi-user controlled non-stop gameplay.

In 2017, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;Pokémon Red and Green&quot; to its World Video Game Hall of Fame. In October 2021, the Japan Sumo Association formed a partnership with The Pokémon Company to celebrate the 25th anniversary of &quot;Pokémon Red and Blue&quot; and (professional sumo referee) were seen wearing Poké Ball-themed kimono during the January 2022 tournament.

=== Remakes ===
 and are enhanced remakes of &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. The new games were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance and have compatibility with the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter, which originally came bundled with the games. However, due to the new variables added to &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; (such as changing the single, &quot;Special&quot; stat into two separate &quot;Special Attack&quot; and &quot;Special Defense&quot; stats), these games are not compatible with older versions outside of the third generation of Pokémon. &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; were first released in Japan on January 29, 2004, and released in North America and Europe on September 9 and October 1, 2004 respectively. Nearly two years after their original release, Nintendo re-marketed them as &quot;Player&#x27;s Choice&quot; games.

The games received critical acclaim, obtaining an aggregate score of 81 percent on Metacritic. Most critics praised the fact that they introduced new features while still maintaining the traditional gameplay of the series. Reception of the graphics and audio was more mixed, with some reviewers complaining that they were too simplistic and not much of an improvement over the previous games, &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; were commercial successes, selling a total of around 12 million copies worldwide.

 and are enhanced remakes of &quot;Pokémon Yellow Version&quot;, released in November 2018 for the Nintendo Switch. They were aimed at newcomers to the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series, and incorporate mechanics from &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;. The games take place in the Kanto region and include only the original 151 Pokémon from the first generation of &quot;Pokémon&quot;. The ability for Pokémon to accompany the protagonist in the overworld returns, a feature last seen in &quot;Pokémon HeartGold&quot; and &quot;SoulSilver&quot; on the Nintendo DS. However, whereas only one Pokémon could be chosen to follow the protagonist previously, they will additionally be accompanied by the starter Pikachu or Eevee in &quot;Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu!&quot; or &quot;Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot;, respectively.

They have combined global sales of over 13 million copies.

<text>The Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs is an international organization that brings together scholars and public figures to work toward reducing the danger of armed conflict and to seek solutions to global security threats. It was founded in 1957 by Joseph Rotblat and Bertrand Russell in Pugwash, Nova Scotia, Canada, following the release of the Russell–Einstein Manifesto in 1955.

Rotblat and the Pugwash Conference jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995 for their efforts on nuclear disarmament. International Student/Young Pugwash groups have existed since founder Cyrus Eaton&#x27;s death in 1979.

==Origin of the Pugwash Conferences==

The Russell–Einstein Manifesto, released July 9, 1955, called for a conference for scientists to assess the dangers of weapons of mass destruction (then only considered to be nuclear weapons). Cyrus Eaton, an industrialist and philanthropist, offered on July 13 to finance and host the conference in the town of his birth, Pugwash, Nova Scotia. This was not taken up at the time because a meeting was planned for India, at the invitation of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. With the outbreak of the Suez Crisis the Indian conference was postponed. Aristotle Onassis offered to finance a meeting in Monaco instead, but this was rejected. Eaton&#x27;s former invitation was taken up.

The first conference was held at what became known as Thinkers&#x27; Lodge in July 1957 in Pugwash, Nova Scotia. Twenty-two scientists attended the first conference:
* seven from the United States: David F. Cavers, Paul M. Doty, Hermann J. Muller, Eugene Rabinowitch, Walter Selove, Leó Szilárd, Victor Frederick Weisskopf
* three from the Soviet Union: Alexander M. Kuzin (Александр М. Кузин), Dmitri Skobeltsyn, Alexander V. Topchiev (Александр В. Топчиев)
* three from Japan: Iwao Ogawa, Shinichiro Tomonaga, Hideki Yukawa
* two from the UK: Cecil F. Powell, Joseph Rotblat
* two from Canada: Brock Chisholm, John S. Foster
* one each from Australia (Mark Oliphant), Austria (Hans Thirring), China (Zhou Peiyuan), France (Antoine M. B. Lacassagne), and Poland (Marian Danysz).
Cyrus Eaton, Eric Burhop, Ruth Adams, Anne Kinder Jones, and Vladimir Pavlichenko also were present. Many others were unable to attend, including co-founder Bertrand Russell, for health reasons. From the Soviet Union, Mikhail Ilyich Bruk (; 1923 Moscow – 2009 Jurmala) attended as an English-Russian technical translator. Later, Armand Hammer stated, &quot;Mike&#x27;s KGB.&quot;

==Organizational structure==
Pugwash&#x27;s &quot;main objective is the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical and biological) and of war as a social institution to settle international disputes. To that extent, peaceful resolution of conflicts through dialogue and mutual understanding is an essential part of Pugwash activities, that is particularly relevant when and where nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction are deployed or could be used.&quot;

&quot;The various Pugwash activities (general conferences, workshops, study groups, consultations and special projects) provide a channel of communication between scientists, scholars, and individuals experienced in government, diplomacy, and the military for in-depth discussion and analysis of the problems and opportunities at the intersection of science and world affairs. To ensure a free and frank exchange of views, conducive to the emergence of original ideas and an effective communication between different or antagonistic governments, countries and groups, Pugwash meetings as a rule are held in private. This is the main modus operandi of Pugwash. In addition to influencing governments by the transmission of the results of these discussions and meetings, Pugwash also may seek to make an impact on the scientific community and on public opinion through the holding of special types of meetings and through its publications.&quot;

Officers include the president and secretary-general. Formal governance is provided by the Pugwash Council, which serves for five years. There is also an executive committee that assists the secretary-general. Jayantha Dhanapala is the current president. Paolo Cotta-Ramusino is the current Secretary General.

The four Pugwash offices, in Rome (international secretariat), London, Geneva, and Washington D.C., provide support for Pugwash activities and serve as liaisons to the United Nations and other international organizations.

There are approximately fifty national Pugwash groups, organized as independent entities and often supported or administered by national academies of science.

The International Student/Young Pugwash groups works with, but are independent from, the international Pugwash group.

==Contributions to international security==
Pugwash&#x27;s first fifteen years coincided with the Berlin Crisis, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, and the Vietnam War. Pugwash played a useful role in opening communication channels during a time of otherwise-strained official and unofficial relations. It provided background work to the Partial Test Ban Treaty (1963), the Non-Proliferation Treaty (1968), the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (1972), the Biological Weapons Convention (1972), and the Chemical Weapons Convention (1993). Former US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara has credited a backchannel Pugwash initiative (code named PENNSYLVANIA) with laying the groundwork for the negotiations that ended the Vietnam War. Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the influence of the organisation on him when he was leader of the Soviet Union. In addition, Pugwash has been credited with being a groundbreaking and innovative &quot;transnational&quot; organization and a leading example of the effectiveness of Track II diplomacy.

During the Cold War, it was claimed that the Pugwash Conference became a front conference for the Soviet Union, whose agents often managed to weaken Pugwash critique of USSR and instead concentrate on blaming the United States and the West. In 1980, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence received a report that the Pugwash Conference was used by Soviet delegates to promote Soviet propaganda. Joseph Rotblat said in his 1998 Bertrand Russell Peace Lecture that there were a few participants in the conferences from the Soviet Union &quot;who were obviously sent to push the party line, but the majority were genuine scientists and behaved as such&quot;.

Following the end of the Cold War, the traditional Pugwash focus on decreasing the salience of nuclear weapons and promoting a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction addresses the following issue areas:

*Nuclear stability, nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation: 1. Traditional Nuclear Disarmament, US-Russia nuclear disarmament, nuclear weapons in Europe; 2. Nuclear weapons and nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, Israeli nuclear weapons, Iranian nuclear program, proposal for a Middle Eastern zone free of weapons of mass destruction, Arab attitudes towards nuclear weapons and nuclear proliferation; 3. India and Pakistan nuclear relations, the effects of US India nuclear deal; 4. North Korea.
*Regional security in regions where nuclear weapons exist or risks of nuclear proliferation are significant: 1. Middle East—general issues, the impact of the Palestinian problem and its relevance in the Arab world, the consequences of the so-called Arab spring and the growth of the Islamic movements and parties, Arab-Iranian, Arab-Israeli and Iran-Israeli relations; 2. South-Central Asia—traditional antagonism between India and Pakistan, the role of terrorist attacks in the worsening of such antagonism, US-Pakistani relations in general. The role of radical movements in Pakistan, reconciliation and peace in Afghanistan, talking to the Taliban (is it possible and how should be done?), Pakistani-Afghan relations.

The Pugwash movement has also been concerned with environmental issues and as a result of its 1988 meeting in Dagomys it issued the Dagomys Declaration on Environmental Degradation ().

==Nobel Peace Prize==
In 1995, fifty years after the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and forty years after the signing of the Russell–Einstein Manifesto, the Pugwash Conferences and Joseph Rotblat were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly &quot;for their efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international politics and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms.&quot; The Norwegian Nobel committee hoped that awarding the prize to Rotblat and Pugwash would &quot;encourage world leaders to intensify their efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons.&quot; In his acceptance speech, Rotblat quoted a key phrase from the Manifesto: &quot;Remember your humanity.&quot;

==International Foundation for Science==
From the 1965 Pugwash conference came a recommendation to establish the International Foundation for Science &quot;in order to address the stultifying conditions under which younger faculty members in the universities of developing countries were attempting to do research&quot;. The organization gives grants to early-career scientists in low-income countries for work on local water resources and biology.

==Pugwash Presidents==
As of 2024, 14 individuals have served as Presidents of the Pugwash Conferences.
*Earl (Bertrand) Russell, 1950 Nobel Prize in Literature, a founder of the movement, was its natural head in its initial years. The formal office of the presidency was established at the Quinquennial Conference in Ronneby, in 1967. The president&#x27;s role was to &quot;preside over the Annual Pugwash Conferences and, in addition, between Conferences, to offer his counsel and advice to the members of the Continuing Committee and the Secretary-General, and thereby assist them in the execution of the activities of the Movement.&quot;
*Sir John Cockcroft, joint recipient of the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics for pioneering work on the transmutation of atomic nuclei by artificially accelerated atomic particles, was elected as the first president in 1967, though he died suddenly ten days later.
*Lord Florey, who shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for extraction of penicillin, was then invited to become president, though he also died within weeks. At that point the Continuing Committee decided to have a rotating presidency for a term of one year, to have that office held by a distinguished person in the country where the annual conference would be held each year.
*Francis Perrin (1968), had worked with Frederic Joliot&#x27;s team to establish in 1939 the possibility of nuclear chain reactions and nuclear energy production.
*Mikhail Millionshchikov (1969), an eminent physicist who later became Speaker of the Russian Parliament.
*Eugene Rabinowitch (1970), American biophysicist who worked on the Manhattan Project and was co-author with Leo Szilard of the Franck Report and co-founder in 1945 of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. In September 1970, the Continuing Committee switched back to the initial idea of a permanent office of president, with a five-year term.
*Hannes Alfvén (1970–1975), recipient of the 1970 Nobel in Physics for work on his theory of magnetohydrodynamics.
*Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin (1976–1988), recipient of the 1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her determinations by X-ray techniques of the structures of important biochemical substances.
*Sir Joseph Rotblat (1988–1997), physicist, one of the founders of the Pugwash Movement, co-recipient of the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize.
*Sir Michael Atiyah (1997–2002), a mathematician, was awarded the 1966 Fields Medal, for his work in developing K-theory.
*Prof. M.S. Swaminathan (2002–2007), agricultural scientist, one of the pioneers of the Green Revolution and recipient of the World Food Prize and the UNESCO Gandhi Prize.
*Amb. Jayantha Dhanapla (2007–2017), former Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs at the United Nations (1998–2003), and former Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the US (1995–1997) and to the UN Office in Geneva (1984–1987)
*Amb. Sergio Duarte (2017–2024), former UN Undersecretary for Disarmament Affairs and a retired career diplomat from Brazil
*Dr. Hussain al-Shahristani (2024- ), is an Iragi scientists and politician.

==Pugwashites==
The Pugwash Conference itself does not have formal membership (although national organisations do). All participants take part in their individual capacities and not as representatives of any organization, institution or government. Anyone who has attended a meeting is considered a &quot;Pugwashite&quot;. There are more than 3,500 &quot;Pugwashites&quot; worldwide.

<text>The Penn Museum is an archaeology and anthropology museum at the University of Pennsylvania. It is located on Penn&#x27;s campus in the University City neighborhood of Philadelphia, at the intersection of 33rd and South Streets. Housing over 1.3 million artifacts, the museum features one of the most comprehensive collections of Middle and Near-Eastern art in the world.

==History==
The Penn Museum, originally called the &quot;University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology&quot;, was founded in 1887 following a successful archaeological expedition to the ancient site of Nippur in modern-day Iraq (then part of the Ottoman Empire). Provost William Pepper persuaded the trustees of the University of Pennsylvania to erect a fireproof building to house artifacts from the excavation. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, North American and European museums regularly sponsored such excavations throughout the Mediterranean and Near East, sharing the ownership of their discoveries with the host country. Penn Museum followed this practice in acquiring the vast majority of its collections, and, as a result, most of the museum&#x27;s objects have a known archaeological context, increasing their value for archaeological and anthropological research and presentation. Since its beginning, the Penn Museum&#x27;s scientists have conducted more than 300 archaeological and anthropological expeditions around the world. 

Today the museum&#x27;s three floors of gallery space feature materials from the ancient Mediterranean World, Egypt, the Near East, Mesopotamia, East Asia, and Mesoamerica, as well as artifacts from the indigenous peoples of Africa and Native America. Since 1958, the Penn Museum has published Expedition magazine. () The excavations and collections of the museum provide resources for student research and the museum hosts the Graduate Group in the Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World.

===2009 restructuring===
On November 19, 2008, the Penn Museum&#x27;s administration terminated eighteen Research Specialist positions in archaeological and anthropological research in the Mediterranean world, the Middle East, and Americas sections, effective May 31, 2009. The scientific research center MASCA (Museum Applied Science Center for Archaeology) was also closed, although the MASCA scientists moved to other Sections within the museum. The decision elicited local and world-wide criticism among concerned scholars, who felt that it departed from the Penn Museum&#x27;s historic mission as a research institution. Museum administrators attributed this measure to the 2008 financial crisis and the deep budget cuts that had resulted at the University of Pennsylvania. The museum&#x27;s director at the time, Dr. Richard Hodges later offered positions as &quot;Associate Curators&quot; or &quot;Research Project Managers&quot; to eleven of the eighteen individuals affected. The museum affirmed its commitment to research, citing more than fifty active research projects spanning five continents that were engaging nearly 200 Museum-affiliated scholars—more than at any other archaeological and anthropological institute or museum in North America could claim at the time.

===Museum building===

The museum is housed in an Arts and Crafts and Eclectic style building that is one of the landmarks of the University of Pennsylvania campus. The existing original building (onto which have been grafted several later additions) is actually only approximately one-third of an ambitious design that would have created one of the largest museum buildings in the United States. Features of the extant building include a dramatic rotunda, multiple courtyards and gardens, a fountain, reflecting pool, glass mosaics, iron gates, and stone statuary. The Penn Museum was designed by a team of Philadelphia architects, all of whom taught on the faculty of the university: Wilson Eyre, Cope &amp; Stewardson and Frank Miles Day. The first phase was completed in 1899 and housed the discoveries from an expedition sponsored by the university to the ancient site of Nippur. The rotunda, which houses the Harrison Auditorium, was completed in 1915. Charles Klauder designed the Coxe Memorial Wing, which opened in 1926 to house the museum&#x27;s Egyptian collection. The Sharpe Wing was completed in 1929.

The Coxe Memorial Egyptian Wing was added to the museum in 1924 through a bequest by former museum board president Eckley Coxe. The administrative wing was added in 1929. The Academic Wing, which provided laboratories for the Anthropology department and classrooms was opened in 1971. The most recent major addition was made in 2002, with the addition of the Mainwaring (Collections Storage) Wing.

==Museum Library==
The Museum Library was established in 1900 when the personal library of University of Pennsylvania professor of American archaeology and linguistics Daniel Garrison Brinton was acquired. This library contained an estimated 4,098 volumes of which the ethnology and linguistics of the American Indigenous peoples were the primary disciplines. This library also consists of a manuscript collection of nearly two hundred volumes relevant to the study of autochthonous Central American languages; most of which are either severely endangered or have completely disappeared. The original location of the library holdings was the Furness Building until they were transferred to the museum building in 1898. They were relocated to the Elkins Library up until 1971 upon when they were moved to their final home in the university extension of the museum.

Prior to its move in 1971 the collection was built upon the support of museum curators contributing their personal monographs, negotiations with affiliate institutions here and abroad as well as endowments by philanthropic individuals.

The library collection was maintained by a staff comprising a single part-time librarian until 1942 when Cynthia Griffin became the first full-time librarian. It was under Griffin that the collection and library witnessed many developments. Prior to her arrival use of the library had been limited to employees of the museum and university professor; however, Griffin extended the accessibility to include students. She also augmented communication networks between the library and libraries worldwide. Within twenty years the library&#x27;s collection more than doubled its capacity from nearly 20,000 volumes in 1945 to over 46,000 volumes in 1965, and by 1971 the breadth of the collection was well over 50,000 volumes increasing by 14,000 volumes annually.

The range of disciplines featured in the collection is specific to the museum itself and incorporates all divisions of anthropology and archaeology. There is a special emphasis on works published within the field of Mesoamerican archaeology as well as works which relate to the current research of the university&#x27;s professors. As of 2008 there are approximately 115,000 volumes in the library&#x27;s collection, 14,000 of these volumes have been circulated on an annual basis. The library also has subscriptions to an estimated 549 scholarly journals. Computing services within the library include desktop and laptop computers. Other services encompass a range of printing and scanning utilities as well as accommodating seating for 154 individuals. The library supports two quiet rooms for patron study, a space to examine photographs, a room designed specifically for microform research, and a collection of audio and video materials.

==Collections==

Penn Museum&#x27;s extensive collections fall into three main divisions: archaeology, the artifacts recovered from the past by excavation, ethnology, the objects and ideas collected from living peoples, and physical anthropology, the physical remains of humans and nonhuman primates. For curation and display, the items in the archaeology and ethnology collections are organized by geographic regions. As of 2023, there are eleven permanent galleries: Africa, Asia, Egypt, Sphinx, Middle East, Eastern Mediterranean, Etruscan, Greece, Rome, Native American Voices and Mexico and Central America. The collections are organized along similar lines, but with larger geographic groupings for some regions. Collection areas include Africa, America (North, Central and South), Asia, Egypt, Europe (Etruscan, Greece and Rome), Mediterranean, Near East and Oceania. Many items within these collections are not on display in the permanent galleries, but may be used for research and temporary exhibits. None of the items in the physical anthropology collections are on display, but they are used for research. 

=== Ethnology and Archaeology Collections ===

==== Africa ====
The Penn Museum has one of the largest collections of African ethnographic and archaeological objects in the country. Mostly obtained from 1891 to 1937, the collection contains objects from all regions of Africa, but with a concentration from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Angola, Morocco, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Madagascar.

The Penn Museum has one of the most extensive Sherbro Island collections in the world. During a museum sponsored expedition in 1936–1937, Curator of General Ethnology, Henry Usher Hall spent seven months conducting ethnographic research among the Sherbro people of Sierra Leone. The collection consists of textiles, sculpture, artifacts related to subsistence and household items, secret society and examples of medicine bundles. Hall&#x27;s papers include field notes, bibliographies, and textual commentaries that provide ethnographic information about the way of life of the Sherbro people and others—including the Mende, Krim, and Temne peoples—who lived among them.

The Central African collection includes approximately 3000 artifacts from the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly the Belgian Congo). The majority of these artifacts were collected by the German ethnographer Leo Viktor Frobenius on his expedition to the Kasai district of the Congo in 1906. His collection illustrates the diverse sculptural forms found among the different cultural groups in the Central African region. Some of the cultures represented in the collection are the Kuba, Kongo, Luba, Suku, Yaka, Pende, Teke, Chokwe, and Luluwa. One of the lesser known collection within the African Section is the Moroccan collection. Dr. and Mrs. Talcott Williams travelled to Morocco in 1898 and returned with approximately 600 objects to document the cultures in Morocco. The collection consists of clothing, shoes, rugs, blankets, weapons, jewelry, pottery, baskets, cooking pots. This thorough collection of objects representing daily life was well documented by Dr. Williams who also collected on behalf of the Smithsonian.

On November 16, 2019, the Penn Museum debuted a newly renovated African gallery alongside many other new galleries and rooms. Penn professor of Sociology and Africana Studies, Dr. Tufuku Zuberi, was appointed as the head curator for the new Africa exhibit, and approached his former student Breanna Moore about designing a new dress for the gallery. Moore enlisted the help of her friend and Philadelphia artist, Emerson Ruffin, to create the dress titled “Wearable Literature”, now a popular item in the Penn Museum&#x27;s African galleries.

==== North America ====
The North American archaeological collections contain heritage items from twenty thousand years old to a few hundred years old. In the 1960s, these were arranged chronologically. Some of these items were excavated in the late 19th century and early 20th century, while others were purchased or donated by reputable collectors. In 1896, Frank Hamilton Cushing excavated wolf, deer and human masquettes that he found in the waters off of Key Marco, Florida. The masquettes were unfortunately distorted upon removal from the water, but they and the numerous tools and practical items had an unusually high level of preservation due to their underwater location. In the interwar years, Edgar B. Howard excavated some of the oldest items in the collection from the American Southwest. His excavations in 1932 and 1933 near Clovis, New Mexico, are significant in identifying the Clovis Point, and in proving the co-existence of humans and extinct animals such as the bison and mammoth.

The North American ethnographic holdings number approximately 40,000 heritage items attributed to approximately 200 Indigenous nations and organized within eleven geographic regions (Arctic, Sub-Arctic, Northwest Coast, Plateau, California, Great Basin, Southwest, Great Plains, Southeast and Northeast). The strongest collections are those systematically created via ethnographic collecting expeditions in Alaska, the Northwest Coast, Southwest, Southeast, and Sub-arctic regions. Many of the Northwest Coast materials were collected in the early 20th century by Louis Shotridge, the son of an influential Tlingit chiefly family. Penn Museum director George Byron Gordon hired Shotridge as a curator. He worked for the museum in various capacities between 1912 and 1932, including multiple field expeditions sponsored by John Wanamaker. Prominent ethnographers of the time also contributed to the North American collections. As a professor and chair of the anthropology department at the University of Pennsylvania, Frank Gouldsmith Speck was one of the most prolific donors to the museum&#x27;s Sub-Arctic ethnology collections. In addition, Speck was an early adopter of audio recording technology with which he gathered examples of Creek and Yuchi songs. Individual donations significantly contribute to the collections in many areas.

==== Mexico and Central America ====

Penn Museum&#x27;s Mesoamerican collections include objects from Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and Costa Rica. The American Section&#x27;s ethnographic collections from Mesoamerica include strong collections of masks, ceramics, and textiles from Guatemala, and very small collections from Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. In Guatemala, Robert Burkitt acquired ethnographic ceramics, textiles, tools, hammocks, fans and gourds from the Alta Verapaz the early twentieth century.

The museum houses the outstanding Lilly de Jongh Osborne collection of 19th and early 20th century Guatemalan textiles, exceptional because of its complete outfits for men, women and children acquired systematically across different Guatemalan villages. This collection includes raw material and other objects and tools related to weaving. Ruben Reina studied the production of ceramics in Guatemala in the 1960s and 1970s, and collected ceramics and textiles from the region. The Section houses a large collection of Guatemalan masks amassed by James Moore in the 1960s.

The Penn Museum conducted an excavation of the Mayan city of Tikal, Guatemala from 1956 to 1970. Many important artifacts from this excavation are on view in the museum, along with several stelae from the contemporary cities of Caracol and Piedras Negras. The gallery also displays many Aztecan, Oaxacan, and Teotihuacano artifacts.

On November 16, 2019, the Penn Museum launched a new exhibit entitled &quot;The Mexico and Central America Gallery.&quot; This gallery features art and artifacts from eight Central American countries, including Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. Specifically, one object of importance that is on display is Stela 14, a limestone rock with intricate carvings that stands at ten feet tall. Tatiana Proskouriakoff excavated this object in Piedras Negras, and at the time of its discovery, archaeologists could not decipher the Mayan hieroglyphics engraved in it. Proskouriakoff cross-referenced the glyphs on the Stela to historical events, eventually decoding the hieroglyphic language. Proskouriakoff&#x27;s discovery transformed the field of Maya Studies.

==== South America ====
The museum&#x27;s South American collections are as varied as the regions from which they come – the arid coast of Peru, the Andean Highlands, and the tropical lowlands of the Amazon Basin. The collections include anthropological materials from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela.

The American Section&#x27;s ethnographic holdings from South America are strongest in materials from Bolivia, Brazil, Guyana, and Peru. The Aymara, Quechua, and Yuracaré of Bolivia are represented in early collections acquired by Max Uhle and William Curtis Farabee. More than thirty indigenous tribes from Brazil are represented in ethnographic collections acquired by Farabee and Vincenzo M. Petrullo in the 1920s and 1930s respectfully. Twelve different indigenous groups are represented in the collections acquired in Guyana by Farabee in the 1920s. More than twenty-five native groups from Peru are represented as well. Smaller collections represent some of the indigenous peoples of Argentina (Yahgan), Chile (Alacaluf, Mapuche), Colombia (Arhuaco, Chocó, Goajira, and Kogi), and Ecuador (Jívaro, Tumaco, Saparo).

==== Asia ====

The Penn Museum&#x27;s Asian collection is composed of close to 3,000 objects of art and artifacts from China, Tibet, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia, India and other Asian countries. Through the concerted efforts of Dr. George Byron Gordon, the majority of this collection focuses on China. From 1914-1918 and again in 1923-1924, Penn Museum archaeologists attempted archaeological expeditions in China that ended in failure. Consequently, the vast majority of the Chinese collection was purchased or donated through dealers in North America. Nevertheless, it includes a significant number of high quality works of antiquity, such as the over 290 porcelain vases and sculptures collected by banking magistrate, J.P. Morgan. The Penn Museum acquired another important Asian collection from amateur collectors William and Isabel Ingram Mayer who made a collecting expedition across Mongolia and northern China in 1930-1931. The Mayer Collection consists of 464 small bronze daggers, harnesses, plaques, and a variety of ornaments that represent the &quot;Ordos&quot; style made by the Scythians and related nomadic peoples between the 12th century BCE and 3rd century CE, as well as some metalworks of more recent origin. Maxwell Sommerville (1829-1904), one of the first curators at the Penn Museum, contributed many items from Japan and India including a set of Kalighat paintings from India that represent almost the entire Hindu pantheon.

The Asian Gallery is mounted in Harrison Rotunda, which measures ninety feet across and ninety feet from the floor. Since its completion in 1915, this gallery has showcased the Chinese collection. One of the central figures is a ceramic statue of a Luohan, reputed to be one of a group of eight or ten statues from a cave in Yizhou that date between 947 and 1234 CE. Other rare Chinese works of art on display are two of the six horse panels from Emperor Taizong&#x27;s Mausoleum in Shaanxi Province. Each of these horses had names and poems commemorating their service in the fight to unify China during the Tang dynasty. The secular focus and historic realism of these reliefs marked a new direction in Chinese art. Four of the panels are at the Beilin Museum in Xi&#x27;an, while the only two to have left China were donated to the Penn Museum by Eldridge R. Johnson, the founder of the Victor Talking Machine Company. Johnson also donated the perfectly spherical crystal ball that sits in the center of the gallery, which is supposed to have belonged to Empress Cixi (1835–1908). Along with an Egyptian statue of Osiris, the Chinese crystal ball was stolen in 1988. Shortly afterwards, a student found its elegant silver stand, a stylized ocean wave, in a culvert not far from the museum. The items were recovered in 1991 after a museum volunteer saw the statue in an antique shop across the Schuylkill River in New Jersey. The FBI then traced the crystal ball to a home in New Jersey and returned it to the museum without a clue that would reveal who the original thieves were or how they committed the crime.

==== Egypt ====

The museum&#x27;s collection of Egyptian artifacts is considered one of the finest in the world. The museum&#x27;s Egyptian galleries house an extensive collection of statuary, mummies, and reliefs. Most notably, the museum houses a set of architectural elements, including large columns and a 13-ton granite Sphinx of Ramesses II, circa 1200 B.C., from the palace of the Pharaoh Merenptah. These were excavated by a museum expedition to Egypt in 1915. In the late 1970s Karl-Theodor Zauzich (attendant of the Egyptian section) discovered 3 missing fragments of the Insinger Papyrus in the museum&#x27;s collections.

===Iraq===
The museum&#x27;s most important collection is arguably that of the Royal Tombs of Ur, which The University of Pennsylvania co–excavated with the British Museum in Iraq. Ur was an important and wealthy city-state in ancient Sumer, and the artifacts from its royal tombs showcase the city&#x27;s wealth. The collections consists of a variety of crowns, figures, and musical instruments, many of which have been inlaid with gold and precious stones. The often traveling collection includes a well known Bull-headed lyre. The museum&#x27;s Babylonian section houses a collection of almost 30,000 clay tablets inscribed in Sumerian and Akkadian cuneiform, making it one of the ten largest collections in the world. The collection contains the largest number of Sumerian school tablets and literary compositions of any of the world&#x27;s museums, as well as important administrative archives ranging from 2900 to 500 BCE.

=== Physical Anthropology Collections ===

==== Morton Collection ====
The Penn Museum holds approximately 1,300 skulls collected by 19th century physician Samuel George Morton. The museum acquired the collection from the Academy of Natural Sciences in 1966. Morton has long been criticized for promoting white supremacist views, leveraging science to uphold racism, poor research quality, and unethically collecting human remains without consent. Despite this, the museum claims the collection is an important historic and research resource. The museum has actively conducted research using the collection in recent years. More than a dozen crania, along with mid-19th century measuring devices, were on public display at the museum from 2012 to 2013 in an exhibit named &quot;Year of Proof: Making and Unmaking Race&quot;. In 2018, students in the Penn and Slavery project discovered the collection includes 55 crania of enslaved people, with 53 of these crania from Havana and two from the United States. In July 2020 the museum announced it would move the collection from a private classroom into storage after criticism from students and the local community. The museum is also planning to repatriate or rebury skulls of enslaved individuals. In 2024, the museum buried the remains of 19 African-American residents of Philadelphia that it held in its collection in Eden Cemetery, that has been used by the African-American community. The interment sparked criticism from prominent members and groups representing the African-American community in Philadelphia, who said that they had not been consulted on the matter.

==== MOVE Bombing Victim Remains ====
In April 2021, following critical news coverage, the Penn Museum and the University of Pennsylvania apologized to the Africa &quot;family&quot; and the community in general for allowing human remains from the 1985 MOVE bombing to be used in research and training. In 1986, an official from the Philadelphia City Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office gave burned human remains found at the MOVE house to the museum for verification that the bones were those of 14 year old Katricia Dotson (a.k.a. Katricia or Tree Africa) and 12 year old Delisha Orr (a.k.a. Delisha Africa), although after the death certificates for both of those children were written, and after Dotson&#x27;s family believed they were given Dotson&#x27;s remains for burial in 1985. These remains were kept in a cardboard box in storage for decades and used for teaching by Alan Mann, a professor at Penn, and Janet Monge, Mann&#x27;s graduate student and later curator of physical anthropology at the Penn Museum. Without the family&#x27;s permission, in 2019 the bones were used as a case study in an online forensic course by Janet Monge. They were also used as the subject of a Penn senior thesis in anthropology which Monge supervised. Although the bones used by Monge in the online case study were given to MOVE members in 2021, accounts differ regarding how many remains were at the Penn Museum and whether all bones which were given to Mann and Monge in 1986 were returned in 2021. A legal team hired by the University of Pennsylvania stated that the bones of Delisha Orr were never at the Penn Museum. However, an investigation by the City of Philadelphia disagreed, and stated that there was evidence that remains of Delisha Orr were at the Penn Museum. Nine forensic anthropologists certified by the American Board of Forensic Anthropology disagreed with the claims published by Penn&#x27;s legal team and agreed with those of the City of Philadelphia. The City of Philadelphia also questioned whether all the remains of Katricia Dotson which were at the Penn Museum were given to MOVE in 2021.

<doc id="417140" wikidata="Q3776292" url="?curid=417140" title="Greed (game show)">
<text>Greed is an American television game show that aired on Fox for one season. Chuck Woolery was the show&#x27;s host while Mark Thompson was its announcer. The series format consisted of a team of contestants who answered a set of up to eight multiple-choice questions (the first set of four containing one right answer and the second set of four containing four right answers) for a potential prize of up to $2,000,000 ().

Dick Clark and Bob Boden of Dick Clark Productions created the series in response to the success of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;. Production was rushed in an effort to launch the show before &quot;Millionaire&quot;″s new season, and the show premiered less than two months after it was initially pitched. A pilot episode was omitted, and Fox aired its first episode of &quot;Greed&quot; on November 4, 1999.

While its Nielsen ratings were not quite as successful as &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Greed&quot; still improved on Fox&#x27;s performance year-to-year in its timeslots. The show&#x27;s critical reception was mixed; some critics saw it as a rip-off of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, while others believed &quot;Greed&quot; was the more intriguing and dramatic of the two programs. Its final episode aired July 14, 2000, and &quot;Greed&quot; was abruptly canceled following the conclusion of its first season as Fox&#x27;s leadership shifted the network&#x27;s focus to scripted programming. The top prize was never awarded; only one contestant advanced to the eighth and final question, failing to win the prize.

==Gameplay==

===Qualifying round===
Six contestants are asked a question with a numerical answer. After all six submit a number, the answer is revealed and the contestant whose numerical guess is farthest from the exact answer is eliminated. The remaining contestants are stationed at podiums based upon the proximity of their guess to the correct answer, and the contestant who had the closest guess becomes the team&#x27;s captain. If two or more contestants give the same guess or guesses that are of equal distance from the correct answer, the one who locks in their answer before the other(s) receives the higher ranking.

===Question round===
The team attempts to answer a series of eight questions worth successively higher amounts, from $25,000 up to $2,000,000. Each of the first four questions has one correct answer to be chosen from several options (four for questions one and two, five for questions three and four). The host reads the question and possible answers to one contestant, who has unlimited time to select one of them. The captain can either accept that answer or replace it with a different one. If the final choice is correct, the team&#x27;s winnings are increased to the value of that question; the captain can then choose to either quit the game or risk the money on the next question. If the captain quits after any of these four questions, the money is split evenly among all five team members. Giving or accepting a wrong answer ends the game and forfeits all winnings. The team member in the lowest position (farthest from the correct answer when a qualifying question was played) gives the answer to the first question, and each question after that is answered by the member in the next higher position.

The remaining four questions each have four correct answers to be chosen from several options, starting with six for question five and increasing by one for each question after that. The host reveals the category of the upcoming fifth question to the captain and offers a chance to end the game, with the prize money being divided among the remaining players according to their shares. If the captain chooses to continue, a &quot;Terminator&quot; round is played prior to the question being asked. The captain is given a single &quot;Freebie&quot; lifeline prior to question five and can use it once to eliminate a wrong answer from a question.

For questions five through seven, answers are given one at a time by the remaining contestants with the captain answering last, then (if necessary) choosing to either give enough additional answers to make four or delegate the choices to other members. Once all the answers are in, the captain may either approve the choices as they stand or change one of them if desired. Answers are revealed individually as correct or incorrect; if three correct answers are found, the host offers a buyout to quit the game. Ten percent of the question value is offered on questions five and six ($20,000 and $50,000 respectively), to be split evenly among the remaining players, and the team&#x27;s decision is entirely up to the captain. On question seven, each team member can choose to take an individual buyout consisting of a luxury automobile and $25,000 cash (approximately $100,000 total value).

If the captain (at questions five and six) or at least one team member (at question seven) chooses to continue with the game, the fourth answer is revealed. If it is correct, the team splits the cash award for the question at that level. If an incorrect answer is revealed at any point, the game ends and the team leaves with nothing.

===Terminator===
A Terminator challenge is played before each question starting at question five. One contestant is chosen at random and given the option to challenge a teammate (including the team captain) to a one-question showdown for their share of the team&#x27;s collective winnings. If the selected contestant issues a challenge, they are given a guaranteed $10,000 in cash to keep regardless of the outcome of the Terminator or the overall game. If the selected contestant does not wish to issue a challenge, the team remains as it was and the host proceeds to the next question.

The two contestants face each other across podiums at center stage, and the host reads a toss-up question with a single answer. The first contestant to buzz in and answer correctly eliminates the other contestant from the game and claims their share of the collective winnings. If a contestant buzzes in and provides an incorrect response or does not immediately respond, their opponent wins by default. If the team captain is eliminated, the contestant who wins the challenge becomes the new captain.

===$2,000,000 question===
Before the $2,000,000 question, each team member can decide to quit with their share of the team&#x27;s collective winnings or continue playing. If any team members choose to continue, a question with nine possible answers is presented, of which four are correct. Contestants who reach this level are given 30 seconds to select four answers. If they fail to do so within the time limit, the game ends and they leave with nothing. Following the selection of answers, correct responses are revealed individually. None of the answers can be changed and no buyout is offered following the reveal of the third correct answer. If all four chosen answers are correct, the contestant (or team) wins $2,000,000.

Only one contestant played the final question throughout the show&#x27;s run. On the episode that aired on November 18, 1999, Daniel Avila chose to risk his $200,000 individual winnings to play for the top prize (which had been increased to $2,200,000 as it was during &quot;Greed&quot;″s progressive jackpot shows). However, Avila missed the question based on a Yale University study about the four smells most recognizable to the human nose (peanut butter, coffee, Vicks VapoRub, and chocolate). Avila correctly guessed peanut butter, coffee, and Vicks VapoRub but incorrectly guessed tuna instead of chocolate, and left with nothing.

===Rule changes===

====Top prize====
For the first six episodes of &quot;Greed&quot;″s run, aired November 4, 1999, until December 2, 1999, the top prize started at $2,000,000 and increased by $50,000 after every game in which it went unclaimed. As no team had reached the jackpot question and provided the necessary correct answers, the jackpot reached $2,550,000 in the first month. When the program was picked up as a regular series in Fox&#x27;s weekly lineup, the top prize was changed to a flat $2,000,000.

====&quot;Greed&quot;: Million Dollar Moment====
In February 2000, eight previous &quot;Greed&quot; contestants were brought back for a &quot;Million Dollar Moment&quot; at the end of each of four episodes. The contestants were all players who had gotten close to the $2,000,000 jackpot question. Two contestants faced off with a Terminator-style sudden-death question, and the winner was given a $1,000,000 question with eight possible choices. The contestant had up to 30 seconds to study the question, then 10 seconds to lock in the four correct answers to win the money. Correct answers were revealed one at a time (as on the jackpot question, no buyout was offered after the third correct answer), and if all four were correct, the contestant won an additional $1,000,000.

Curtis Warren became &quot;Greed&quot;″s only Million Dollar Moment winner when he successfully answered a question about movies based on television shows on the episode that aired on February 11, 2000. Warren was the program&#x27;s biggest winner with $1,410,000 and briefly held the title of biggest U.S. game show winner in history; combined with an earlier six-figure winning streak on &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; in 1986 and an appearance on &quot;Win Ben Stein&#x27;s Money&quot;, his total game show winnings stood at $1,546,988. Warren&#x27;s record was broken shortly thereafter by David Legler, who won $1,765,000 on &quot;Twenty-One&quot;. He has since been surpassed by others, including &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; champions Ken Jennings, Brad Rutter, and James Holzhauer.

====&quot;Super Greed&quot;====
From April 28 to May 19, 2000, the show was known as &quot;Super Greed&quot;. The qualifying question was eliminated, and the values for the top three questions were doubled, making the eighth question worth a potential $4,000,000. The cash buyout on the sixth question ($1,000,000) was increased to $100,000, and any team that got this question right and continued past it was guaranteed a separate $200,000 regardless of the outcome of the game. During this period, Phyllis Harris served as captain of a team that answered seven questions correctly and shared a $2,000,000 prize, though she and her teammates elected to leave the game before attempting the final $4,000,000 question.

==Production==

&quot;Greed&quot; was created by Dick Clark and Bob Boden of Dick Clark Productions. An hour-long program, it was considered by television critics and network producers to be Fox&#x27;s response to ABC&#x27;s &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, while Fox executive Mike Darnell later confirmed that Fox was &quot;inspired by the success of &quot;Millionaire&quot;.&quot; Boden had initially pitched a similar format that he called &quot;All for One&quot; to NBC, but the network passed on the idea as they already had a revival of &quot;Twenty-One&quot; in development. Clark, meanwhile, wanted a more &quot;provocative&quot; title; when Boden told Clark &quot;the core of the show is greed,&quot; Clark responded, &quot;Let&#x27;s just call it &quot;Greed&quot;.&quot;

Clark and Boden pitched the show to Fox in September, and six episodes were ordered, which began taping less than three weeks later. The series was only given about a month of preparation before it was set to premiere in November 1999. Fox had set the target premiere date of November 4, because it was three days before &quot;Millionaire&quot; was set to return to ABC, and by mid-October, one Fox executive was concerned the network might not have the show ready in time.

Producers considered many potential hosts in the selection process, including veteran game show hosts Chuck Woolery and Bob Eubanks, as well as Keith Olbermann and Gordon Elliott. On October 13, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;″s Gail Shister reported that Olbermann was close to being named host, while also noting Phil Donahue was Fox&#x27;s first choice, though he proved to be too expensive for the network. Woolery was ultimately selected as the show&#x27;s host due to his game show experience. The production team omitted taping a pilot, allowing the series to be ready in time for its premiere on November 4. Mark Thompson served as the announcer, Bob Levy and Chris Donovan directed the program, and Edgar Struble composed the soundtrack. It was initially subtitled &quot;Greed: The Multi-Million Dollar Challenge&quot;. The tagline for the series was &quot;the Richest, Most Dangerous Game in America.&quot; In January 2000, Fox brought &quot;Greed&quot; back to its schedule by airing it three nights in a row before it began airing weekly on Fridays, in order to avoid competing head-to-head with &quot;Millionaire&quot; on Thursdays.

The majority of &quot;Greed&quot;″s contestants during its first couple of months were hand-picked and recruited by the show&#x27;s producers after a multiple-choice qualification test. Many of them had already appeared on other trivia-based game shows, including Avila and Warren, who were previously winning contestants on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Win Ben Stein&#x27;s Money&quot; respectively. The window between Avila&#x27;s test and when his episode taped was only three days, as he took the test on a Saturday and taped the show the following Tuesday. Once the show became a regular series, Fox began a more nationwide search for contestants, and any legal resident of the U.S. was invited to call or mail in an entry for a chance to audition. Some travel and accommodations were provided by Priceline.com.

Like &quot;Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Greed&quot;″s basic set was atypical of the traditional game show, giving the show a more dramatic feel. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Julia Chaplin compared the set to a video game, saying it was &quot;painted to look like stone blocks, reminiscent of the torch-lighted medieval castles in games like &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Soul Calibur&quot;.&quot; &quot;Greed&quot;″s set designer, Jimmy Cuomo, noted the inspiration from science fiction in his set, specifically from &quot;Star Trek&quot; and various castle settings in video games.

Fox abruptly canceled the program on July 14, 2000. By 2001, Fox executives Sandy Grushow and Gail Berman had led a shift in the network&#x27;s focus through a greater emphasis on scripted programming. In December 2000, Clark stated that he was working on a revised version of &quot;Greed&quot; that he would initially pitch to Fox and then propose to other networks. While this proposed revival was never launched, &quot;Greed&quot;″s original 44-episode run was acquired by Game Show Network (GSN) for reruns in January 2002.and in Australia on FOX8 in 2006.

===International versions===
Following &quot;Greed&quot;″s success in the United States, the show was adapted and recreated in several other countries as a worldwide franchise. American talk show host Jerry Springer hosted a British adaptation of the series on Channel 5 in 2001. Other versions of &quot;Greed&quot; have existed in Argentina, Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Lebanon, Poland, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, and Venezuela. Additionally, the original American series aired in Canada on Global.

==Reception==
&quot;Greed&quot; received mixed critiques. At the beginning of the show&#x27;s run, some critics saw &quot;Greed&quot; as little more than a bad attempt to capitalize on ABC&#x27;s success with &quot;Millionaire&quot;. Scott D. Pierce of &quot;Deseret News&quot; called the series &quot;a rip-off&quot; of &quot;Millionaire&quot;, adding &quot;just how liberally Fox and Dick Clark Productions stole from the ABC hit is a bit of a shocker&quot;. Dana Gee of &quot;The Province&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Greed&quot; fails to entertain&quot; while also criticizing the difficulty of the questions. Joyce Millman of &quot;Salon&quot; added, &quot;a stench of desperation surrounds the show&quot; and referred to it as &quot;Fox&#x27;s last hope&quot; for a primetime hit that television season. &quot;Millionaire&quot; host Regis Philbin was unsurprised Fox launched a competing show, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s so Fox, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; In comparing &quot;Greed&quot; to &quot;Millionaire&quot;, New York &quot;Daily News&quot;&#x27;s David Bianculli wrote that the former &quot;doesn&#x27;t have heart&quot; as it allowed contestants to duel with each other, while also arguing Woolery lacked &quot;warmth and empathy&quot; as host compared to Philbin on &quot;Millionaire&quot;. Joanne Weintraub of the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; called &quot;Greed&quot; &quot;a glum affair&quot; and added that the show seemed &quot;more tedious than tense.&quot; Alan Pergament of &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; shared the sentiment that &quot;Greed&quot; was little more than a &quot;Millionaire&quot; rip-off, though he conceded its Nielsen ratings &quot;were good by Fox standards.&quot;

Others were more favorable of &quot;Greed&quot;, particularly due to its elements of drama. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; two weeks after the show&#x27;s debut, Caryn James believed &quot;Greed&quot; was a more dramatic show than &quot;Millionaire&quot;, comparing it to &quot;blood sport&quot; and saying it &quot;evokes uglier sentiments and brings in less conventional contestants&quot;. &quot;Time&quot;″s James Poniewozik gave the series a more positive review, arguing that &quot;&quot;Greed&quot; Trumps &quot;Millionaire&quot;&quot; based on its lack of lifelines and ability to pit teammates against each other. In December, United Media columnist Kevin McDonough stated that he also preferred &quot;Greed&quot; over the ABC game show, while Bill Carter (also of &quot;The New York Times&quot;) wrote that the series &quot;has fared passably well&quot;. 

&quot;Jeopardy!&quot; champion Bob Harris, who won $200,000 on an episode of &quot;Super Greed&quot;, compared the two trivia-based game shows in his 2006 book &quot;Prisoner of Trebekistan&quot;, saying, &quot;If &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; was a relationship, &quot;Greed&quot; was a tawdry affair: quick, flashy, loud, and kind of confusing.&quot; Harris also recalled a conversation with Woolery years later where the &quot;Greed&quot; host himself admitted that the show&#x27;s rules were &quot;complicated.&quot; In 2019, &quot;Forbes&quot;″s Marc Berman wrote an article titled &quot;20 Years Later: I Still Feel The Need For &quot;Greed&quot;&quot;, arguing that the show could eventually be rebooted due to the &quot;current era of [game show] revivals&quot;.

===Ratings===
&quot;Greed&quot; premiered with a 4.0 rating in adults 18–49 and a total of 9.9 million viewers, improving on Fox&#x27;s Thursday night performance from its other shows that season. The rating gave Fox an improvement of more than 100 percent in that time slot over the previous week, marking the network&#x27;s best Thursday ratings in more than six months. By mid-January 2000, &quot;Greed&quot; brought in around 12 million viewers, which marked Fox&#x27;s best performance in the time slot since the debut of &quot;Millennium&quot;, although the number totaled less than half of &quot;Millionaire&quot;″s audience of more than 28 million. Alan Johnson of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;Greed&quot;″s producers would occasionally have to displace the show and change its schedule to avoid going head-to-head against &quot;Millionaire&quot;. The July 14, 2000, episode (which would ultimately be the series finale) earned 6.7 million viewers.

<text>Exotique was a specialized fetish magazine published by Leonard Burtman under his Burmel Publishing Company imprint in New York City between 1955 and 1959. The magazine&#x27;s femdom theme, photos, and artwork mark it as a direct descendant of the first major fetish magazine &quot;Bizarre&quot; (1946–1959), produced by John Willie.

&quot;Exotique&quot; was entirely devoted to fetish fashions and female-dominant bondage fantasies. The 36 issues featured photos and illustrations of dominatrix-inspired vamps (including wife Tana Louise and iconic model Bettie Page) wearing exotic leather and rubber ensembles, corsets, stockings/garters, boots, and high heels. The articles, many written by Burtman using an alias, covered various aspects of sadomasochism and transvestism, with men depicted as slaves to imperious, all-powerful women. 

Fetish artists Eric Stanton and Gene Bilbrew, also known by his pseudonym &quot;ENEG&quot;, were frequent contributors to this magazine and others produced by Burtman.

&quot;Exotique&quot; had no nudity. Nevertheless, much like fellow publisher Irving Klaw (a major influence on Burton) in 1957, Burtman would be targeted as a pornographer. He was relentlessly pursued by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (acting as a censorship agency then) and local law enforcement (who functioned in coordination with Postal Inspectors and the Catholic Church). Eventually, he was arrested, his magazines and materials confiscated, and he was brought to trial. This led to the demise of the magazine in 1959. 

However, starting in 1960, Burtman (under the Selbee Associates imprint) went on to publish many more fetish magazines that were nearly identical to &quot;Exotique&quot; such as &quot;New Exotique&quot;, &quot;Masque&quot;, &quot;Connoisseur&quot;, &quot;Bizarre Life&quot;, &quot;High Heels&quot;, &quot;Unique World&quot;, &quot;Corporal&quot; (a pioneering spanking-fetish magazine), and others well into the 1970s.

<text>The Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures, West Asia &amp; North Africa (ISAC; formerly the Oriental Institute), established in 1919, is the University of Chicago&#x27;s interdisciplinary research center for ancient Near Eastern studies and archaeology museum. It was founded for the university by Egyptology and ancient history professor James Henry Breasted with funds donated by John D. Rockefeller Jr. It conducts research on ancient civilizations throughout the Near East, including at its facility, Chicago House, in Luxor, Egypt. The institute also publicly exhibits an extensive collection of artifacts related to ancient civilizations and archaeological discoveries at its on-campus building in Hyde Park, Chicago. According to anthropologist William Parkinson of the Field Museum, the ISAC&#x27;s highly focused &quot;near Eastern, or southwest Asian and Egyptian&quot; collection is one of the finest in the world.

==History==

In the early 20th century, James Henry Breasted built up the collection of the university&#x27;s Haskell Oriental Museum, which he oversaw along with his field work, and teaching duties. He dreamed, however, of establishing a research institute, &quot;a laboratory for the study of the rise and development of civilization,&quot; that would trace Western civilization to its roots in the ancient Middle East.

As World War I came toward a close, Breasted sensed an opportunity to use his influence in the new political climate to create opportunities for access to archaeology sites and their study. He wrote to John D. Rockefeller Jr., and proposed the foundation of what would become the Oriental Institute. Fundamental to the implementation of his plan was a research trip through the Middle East, which Breasted had optimistically suggested was ready to receive scholars again after the disturbances of the war. Breasted received a reply from Rockefeller pledging $50,000 over five years for the Oriental Institute. Rockefeller also assured University of Chicago president Harry Pratt Judson that he would pledge another $50,000 to the cause. The University of Chicago contributed additional support, and in May 1919 the Oriental Institute was founded.

The institute is housed in an unusual Art-Deco/Gothic building at the corner of 58th Street and University Avenue, which was designed by the architectural firm Mayers Murray &amp; Phillip.

Construction was completed in 1930, and the building was dedicated in 1931. German American sculptor Ulric Ellerhusen designed the tympanum, titled &quot;East Meets West&quot;. Figures from the East include a lion, Zoser, Hammurabi, Thutmose III, Ashurbanipal, Darius the Great and Chosroes; the West is portrayed by a bison and Herodotus, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, a crusader, an excavator, and an archeologist.

In the 1990s, Tony Wilkinson, founded the &#x27;Center for Ancient Middle Eastern Landscapes&#x27; based at the institute. Its role is to investigate the Middle East through landscape archaeology and the analysis of spatial data, including images from many decades of Middle Eastern aerial photography, and survey maps, as well as, modern satellite imagery.

===Name change===
In the 2010s, multiple organizations within the U.S. began reconsidering the use of the word &quot;Oriental,&quot; as some scholars felt the word was alienating and that it had changed in popular meaning. In March 2023, University of Chicago administrators announced they would be changing the name of the Oriental Institute. Interim director Theo van den Hout said, &quot;[The Oriental Institute] name has caused confusion, often contributing to the perception that our work is focused on East Asia, rather than West Asia and North Africa. Additionally, the word &quot;oriental&quot; has developed a pejorative connotation in modern English.&quot; In April 2023, the organization&#x27;s name changed to the Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures, West Asia &amp; North Africa, abbreviated as ISAC. The institute&#x27;s new logo features a lotus flower, which is found in ancient Assyrian, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian art, as well as being a decorative motif on the ISAC building.

==Research and collection==

The ISAC Museum has artifacts from digs in Egypt, Israel, Syria, Turkey, Iraq, and Iran. Notable works in the collection include the famous Megiddo Ivories; various treasures from Persepolis, the old Persian capital; a collection of Luristan Bronzes; a colossal 40-ton &quot;Lamassu&quot; from Khorsabad, the capital of Sargon II; and a monumental statue of King Tutankhamun. The museum has free admission, although visitors are encouraged to donate.

The Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures, West Asia &amp; North Africa is a center of active research on the ancient Near East. The building&#x27;s upper floors contain a library, classrooms and faculty offices, and its gift shop, the Suq, also sells textbooks for the university&#x27;s classes on Near Eastern studies. In addition to carrying out many digs in the Fertile Crescent, institute scholars have made contributions to the understanding of the origins of human civilization. The term &quot;Fertile Crescent&quot; was coined by J. H. Breasted, who popularized the connection of the rise of civilization in the Near East with the development of European culture.

In 2011, among other projects institute scholars completed publication of the 21-volume &quot;Chicago Assyrian Dictionary&quot;, a basic cultural reference work. The effort was begun in 1921 by J. H. Breasted, and continued by Edward Chiera and Ignace Gelb, with the first volume published in 1956. Erica Reiner as editor-in-charge led the research teams for 44 years. She was succeeded by Martha T. Roth, dean of humanities at the university. Similar dictionaries are under way, including the &quot;Chicago Hittite Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Demotic Dictionary&quot;.

===Chicago House===
The Institute oversees the work of Chicago House in Luxor, Egypt. The Egyptian facility, established in 1924, performs the Epigraphic Survey, which documents and researches the historical sites in Luxor. It also manages conservation at various sites.

==Persian tablets lawsuit==

In 2006, the Oriental Institute was the center of a controversy when a U.S. federal court lawsuit sought to seize and auction a valuable collection of ancient Persian tablets held by the museum. The proceeds were to compensate the victims of a 1997 bombing in Ben Yehuda Street, Jerusalem, an attack which the United States claimed was funded by Iran. The ruling threatened sale of an invaluable collection of ancient clay tablets, held by the Oriental Institute since the 1930s, but owned by Iran. The Achaemenid (or Persepolis) clay tablets were loaned for study to the University of Chicago in 1937. They were uncovered in Persepolis, Iran by American archaeologists from the university in 1933 and are legally the property of the National Museum of Iran and Iran&#x27;s Ministry of Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts. The artifacts were loaned for study based on the understanding that they would be returned to Iran, which the OI had done in batches over the years. The tablets, from Persepolis, the capital of the Achaemenid Empire, date to about 500 BCE.

The tablets give a view of daily life, itemizing such elements as the daily rations of barley given to workers in nearby regions of the empire. The tablets were sent to the capital to provide a record of what they were paying workers. Gil Stein, former director of the Oriental Institute, said that details largely concern food for people on diplomatic or military missions. Each tablet is about half the size of a deck of playing cards and has characters of a dialect of Elamite, an extinct language understood by perhaps a dozen scholars in the world.

Stein described the tablets as providing &quot;the first chance to hear the Persians speaking of their own empire&quot;. Charles Jones, Research Associate and Librarian at the Oriental Institute and tablet expert, compared them to &quot;credit card receipts&quot;. Most current knowledge about the ancient Persian empire comes from the accounts of others, most famously the Greek storyteller Herodotus. Stein added: &quot;It&#x27;s valuable because it&#x27;s a group of tablets, thousands of them from the same archive. It&#x27;s like the same filing cabinet. They&#x27;re very, very valuable scientifically.&quot; The Oriental Institute had been returning them to Iran in small batches. Since the 1930s, the institute had returned several hundred tablets and fragments to Iran and were preparing another shipment when the legal action began. An appeals court later overturned the order of seizure, and in 2018, the United States Supreme Court affirmed the subsequent ruling that the collection cannot be taken from the Institute to satisfy the judgment.

<text>Unreal Engine (UE) is a 3D computer graphics game engine developed by Epic Games, first showcased in the 1998 first-person shooter video game &quot;Unreal&quot;. Initially developed for PC first-person shooters, it has since been used in a variety of genres of games and has been adopted by other industries, most notably the film and television industry. Unreal Engine is written in C++ and features a high degree of portability, supporting a wide range of desktop, mobiles, console, and virtual reality platforms.

The latest generation, Unreal Engine 5, was launched in April 2022. Its source code is available on GitHub, and commercial use is granted based on a royalty model, with Epic charging 5% of revenues over US $1 million, which is waived for games published exclusively on the Epic Games Store. Epic has incorporated features in the engine from acquired companies such as Quixel, which is seen as benefiting from &quot;Fortnite&quot;&#x27;s revenue.

In 2014, Unreal Engine was named the world&#x27;s &quot;most successful videogame engine&quot; by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

==History==
===First generation===

Unreal Engine 1 was initially developed in 1995 by Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney for &quot;Unreal&quot; and used software rendering. It supported Windows, Linux, Mac and Unix. Epic later began to license the Engine to other game studios.

=== Unreal Engine 2 ===

Unreal Engine 2 transitioned the engine from software rendering to hardware rendering and brought support for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube consoles. The first game using UE2 was released in 2002 and its last update was shipped in 2005.

===Unreal Engine 3===

Unreal Engine 3 was one of the first game engines to support multithreading. It used DirectX 9 as its baseline graphics API, simplifying its rendering code. The first games using UE3 were released at the end of 2006.

===Unreal Engine 4===

Unreal Engine 4 brought support for physically based materials and the &quot;Blueprints&quot; visual scripting system. The first game using UE4 was released in April 2014. It was the first version of Unreal to be free to download with royalty payments on game revenue.

===Unreal Engine 5===

Unreal Engine 5 features Nanite, a virtualized geometry system that allows game developers to use arbitrarily high quality meshes with automatically generated Level of Detail, and Lumen, a dynamic global illumination and reflections system that uses software and hardware ray tracing. It was revealed in May 2020 and officially released in April 2022.

==Scripting==
===UnrealScript===
UnrealScript (often abbreviated to UScript) was Unreal Engine&#x27;s native scripting language used for authoring game code and gameplay events before the release of Unreal Engine 4. The language was designed for simple, high-level game programming. UnrealScript was programmed by Tim Sweeney, who also created an earlier game scripting language, ZZT-OOP. &quot;Deus Ex&quot; lead programmer Chris Norden described it as &quot;super flexible&quot; but noted its low execution speed.

Similar to Java, UnrealScript was object-oriented without multiple inheritance (classes all inherit from a common Object class), and classes were defined in individual files named for the class they define. Unlike Java, UnrealScript did not have object wrappers for primitive types. Interfaces were only supported in Unreal Engine generation 3 and a few Unreal Engine 2 games. UnrealScript supported operator overloading, but not method overloading, except for optional parameters.

At the 2012 Game Developers Conference, Epic announced that UnrealScript was being removed from Unreal Engine 4 in favor of C++. Visual scripting would be supported by the Blueprints Visual Scripting system, a replacement for the earlier Kismet visual scripting system.
===Verse===
Verse is the new scripting language for Unreal Engine, first implemented in &quot;Fortnite&quot;. Simon Peyton Jones, known for his contributions to the Haskell programming language, joined Epic Games in December 2021 as Engineering Fellow to work on Verse with his long-time colleague Lennart Augustsson and others. Conceived by Sweeney, it was officially presented at Haskell eXchange in December 2022 as an open source functional-logic language for the metaverse. A research paper, titled &quot;The Verse Calculus: a Core Calculus for Functional Logic Programming&quot;, was also published.

The language was eventually launched in March 2023 as part of the release of the Unreal Editor for &quot;Fortnite&quot; (UEFN) at the Game Developers Conference, with plans to be available to all Unreal Engine users by 2025.

== Marketplace ==
With Unreal Engine 4, Epic opened the Unreal Engine Marketplace in September 2014. The Marketplace is a digital storefront that allows content creators and developers to provide art assets, models, sounds, environments, code snippets, and other features that others could purchase, along with tutorials and other guides. Some content is provided for free by Epic, including previously offered Unreal assets and tutorials. Prior to July 2018, Epic took a 30% share of the sales but due to the success of Unreal and &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot;, Epic retroactively reduced its take to 12%.

==Usage==
===Video games===
Unreal Engine was originally designed to be used as the underlying technology for video games. The engine is used in a number of high-profile game titles with high graphics capabilities, including &quot;Hogwarts Legacy&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;, &quot;Valorant&quot; and &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Crafted World,&quot; in addition to games developed by Epic, including &quot;Gears of War&quot; and &quot;Fortnite&quot;. Polish game developer CD Projekt is also planning to use the engine after retiring their in-house REDengine; their first game to use Unreal will be a remake of &quot;The Witcher&quot;.

===Film and television===
Unreal Engine has found use in film making to create virtual sets that can track with a camera&#x27;s motion around actors and objects and be rendered in real time to large LED screens and atmospheric lighting systems. This allows for real-time composition of shots, immediate editing of the virtual sets as needed, and the ability to shoot multiple scenes within a short period by just changing the virtual world behind the actors. The overall appearance was recognized to appear more natural than typical chromakey effects.
Among the productions to use these technologies were the live action television series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, &quot;Westworld&quot; and &quot;Fallout&quot;, and the animated series &quot;Zafari&quot; and &quot;Super Giant Robot Brothers&quot;. Jon Favreau and Lucasfilm&#x27;s Industrial Light &amp; Magic division worked with Epic in developing their StageCraft technology for &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, based on a similar approach Favreau had used in &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Favreau then shared this technology approach with Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the producers for &quot;Westworld&quot;. The show had already looked at the use of virtual sets before and had some technology established, but integrated the use of Unreal Engine as with StageCraft for its third season.

Orca Studios, a Spanish-based company, has been working with Epic to establish multiple studios for virtual filming similar to the StageCraft approach with Unreal Engine providing the virtual sets, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which restricted travel.

In January 2021, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; announced that Epic was using part of its Epic MegaGrants to back for the first time an animated feature film, &quot;Gilgamesh&quot;, to be produced fully in Unreal Engine by animation studios Hook Up, DuermeVela and FilmSharks. As part of an extension of its MegaGrants, Epic also funded 45 additional projects since around 2020 for making movies and short films in the Unreal Engine. By October 2022, Epic was working with several different groups at over 300 virtual sets across the world. Unreal Engine was used for motion capture in Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile.

===Other uses===
Unreal Engine has also been used by non-creative fields due to its availability and feature sets. It has been used as a basis for a virtual reality tool to explore pharmaceutical drug molecules in collaboration with other researchers, as a virtual environment to explore and design new buildings and automobiles, and used for cable news networks to support real-time graphics.
In March 2012, Epic Games announced a partnership with Virtual Heroes of Applied Research Associates to launch &quot;Unreal Government Network&quot;, a program that handles Unreal Engine licenses for government agencies. Several projects originated with this support agreement, including an anaesthesiology training software for U.S. Army physicians, a multiplayer crime scene simulation developed by the FBI Academy, and various applications for the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity with the aim to help intelligence analysts recognize and mitigate cognitive biases that might affect their work. Similarly, the DHS Science and Technology Directorate and the U.S. Army&#x27;s Training and Doctrine Command and Research Laboratory employed the engine to develop a platform to train first responders titled &quot;Enhanced Dynamic Geo-Social Environment&quot; (EDGE).

== Awards ==
The engine has received numerous awards:

*Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) for &quot;3D Engine Software for the Production of Animation&quot; in 2018
*Primetime Engineering Emmy Award from the Television Academy for exceptional developments in broadcast technology in 2020
*Annie Award from ASIFA-Hollywood for technical advancement in animation in 2021
* &quot;Game Developer Magazine&quot; Front Line Award for Best Game Engine for 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012
* Develop Industry Excellence Award for Best Engine for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018
* &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for most successful video game engine

==Legal aspects==

The state of the Unreal Engine came up in Epic&#x27;s 2020 legal action against Apple Inc. claiming anticompetitive behavior in Apple&#x27;s iOS App Store. Epic had uploaded a version of &quot;Fortnite&quot; that violated Apple&#x27;s App Store allowances. Apple, in response, removed the &quot;Fortnite&quot; app and later threatened to terminate Epic&#x27;s developer accounts which would have prevented Epic from updating the Unreal Engine for iOS and macOS. The court agreed to grant Epic a permanent injunction against Apple to prevent Apple from taking this step, since the court agreed that would impact numerous third-party developers that rely on the Unreal Engine.

<doc id="417154" wikidata="Q577160" url="?curid=417154" title="Albert Gore Sr.">
<text>Albert Arnold Gore Sr. (December 26, 1907 – December 5, 1998) was an American politician who served as a United States senator from Tennessee from 1953 to 1971. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as a U.S. representative from the state&#x27;s 4th congressional district from 1939 to 1953. He was the father of Al Gore, who served as the 45th vice president of the United States from 1993 until 2001, and held Tennessee&#x27;s other U.S. Senate seat from 1985 to 1993. A native of Granville, Tennessee, Gore graduated from Middle Tennessee State Teachers College and taught school. From 1932 to 1936 he was superintendent of schools for Smith County. He attended the Nashville Y.M.C.A. Night Law School, now the Nashville School of Law, from which he graduated in 1936.

He was admitted to the bar later that year, and also accepted appointment as Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Labor, a position he held until 1937. In 1938, Gore was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Tennessee&#x27;s 4th congressional district. He was twice re-elected, and served from 1939 until resigning in December 1944. During World War II, Gore briefly served in the United States Army as part of a program that enabled members of Congress to join the military incognito to obtain firsthand information on training, readiness, and treatment of service members. He served from December 1944 to March 1945, when he was discharged and took the House seat to which he had been elected again in November 1944. He was thereafter re-elected in 1946, 1948, and 1950, and served from 1945 until 1953. In 1952, Gore was a successful candidate for the U.S. Senate. He was reelected in 1958 and 1964, and served from January 1953 to January 1971. Gore was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1970.

In the Senate, Gore championed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. In 1956, he also opposed the segregationist Southern Manifesto, but he voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Gore reversed course a year later and supported the Voting Rights Act of 1965. During the presidency of Lyndon Johnson, Gore backed most of Johnson&#x27;s Great Society programs. Gore&#x27;s 1970 defeat was blamed in part on his opposition to continuing U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. After leaving the Senate, Gore practiced and taught law at Vanderbilt University. He later served as a vice president of the Occidental Petroleum Company and was a member of its board of directors. Gore also served on the boards of directors of several other companies and operated a farm on which he bred Angus cattle. Gore died in Carthage, Tennessee on December 5, 1998, and was buried at Carthage&#x27;s Smith County Memorial Gardens.

==Early years==

Gore was born in Granville, Tennessee in 1907, the third of five children of Margie Bettie ( Denny) and Allen Arnold Gore. Gore&#x27;s ancestors included Anglo-Irish immigrants who first settled in Virginia in the mid-18th century and moved to Tennessee after the American Revolutionary War. As teenagers, Allen Gore and Cordell Hull were friends.

Gore studied at Middle Tennessee State Teachers College, and taught school in Overton and Smith Counties from 1926 to 1930. He first sought elective public office at age 23, when he ran unsuccessfully for superintendent of schools in Smith County. A year later, he was appointed to the position following the death of the incumbent. Gore graduated from the Nashville Y.M.C.A. Night Law School, now the Nashville School of Law, in 1936 and attained admission to the bar.

==Congressional career==

After serving as Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Labor from 1936 to 1937, Gore was elected as a Democrat to the 76th Congress in 1938, re-elected to the two succeeding Congresses, and served from January 3, 1939, until he resigned on December 4, 1944, to enter the U.S. Army.

===Military service===
Gore was one of several members of Congress who joined the military incognito for short tours, in order to observe training and combat and provide first-hand reports to the U.S. House and Senate. He completed basic training at Fort Meade, Maryland, after which he was assigned to the Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories in Germany as a prosecutor in one of the military government courts. Gore served as a private and was discharged in March 1945 so he could take the seat in the U.S. House to which he had been reelected in November 1944.

Gore was re-elected to the 79th and to the three succeeding Congresses (January 3, 1945, to January 3, 1953). In 1951, Gore proposed in Congress that &quot;something cataclysmic&quot; be done by U.S. forces to end the Korean War: a radiation belt (created by nuclear weapons) dividing the Korean peninsula permanently into two.

===U.S. Senate===
In 1952, Gore was not a candidate for House re-election but was elected to the U.S. Senate. In his 1952 election, he defeated six-term incumbent Kenneth McKellar in the Democratic primary. Gore&#x27;s victory is widely regarded as a major turning point in Tennessee political history, largely marking the end of statewide influence for E. H. Crump, the Memphis political boss. During his first term, Gore was instrumental in sponsoring and enacting the legislation creating the Interstate Highway System. Gore was re-elected in 1958 and again in 1964, but lost reelection in 1970.

Gore was one of only three Democratic senators from the former Confederate states who did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto opposing integration, the others being Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas (who was not asked to sign), and Tennessee&#x27;s other Senator, Estes Kefauver. South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond tried to get Gore to sign the Manifesto, but Gore refused. Gore voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1960 and 1968, as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court. Gore voted in favor of the initial Senate resolution on the Civil Rights Act of 1957 on August 7, 1957, but did not vote on House amendment to bill on August 29, 1957. Gore also did not vote on the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and Gore voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Gore easily won renomination in 1958 over former governor Prentice Cooper. At the time, the Democratic nomination was still considered tantamount to election in Tennessee, since the Republican Party was largely nonexistent in many parts of the state. In 1964, he faced an energetic general election challenge from Dan Kuykendall, chairman of the Shelby County Republican Party, who ran a surprisingly strong race against him. While Gore won, Kuykendall held him to only 53 percent of the vote, in spite of President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s landslide victory in the concurrent presidential election.

===1970 campaign and defeat===

By 1970, Gore was considered to be fairly vulnerable for a three-term incumbent Senator, as a result of his liberal positions on many issues such as the Vietnam War (which he opposed) and civil rights. This was especially risky, electorally, as at the time the Republican Party was becoming more competitive in Tennessee. He faced a spirited primary challenge, predominantly from former Nashville news anchor Hudley Crockett, who used his broadcasting skills to considerable advantage and generally attempted to run to Gore&#x27;s right. Gore fended off this primary challenge, but he was ultimately unseated in the 1970 general election by Republican Congressman Bill Brock. Gore was one of the key targets in the Nixon/Agnew &quot;Southern strategy.&quot; He had earned Nixon&#x27;s ire the year before when he criticized the administration&#x27;s &quot;do-nothing&quot; policy toward inflation. In a memo to senior advisor Bryce Harlow, Nixon aide Alexander Butterfield relayed the President&#x27;s desire that Gore be &quot;blistered&quot; for his comment. Spiro T. Agnew traveled to Tennessee in 1970 to mock Gore as the &quot;Southern regional chairman of the Eastern Liberal Establishment&quot;. Other prominent issues in the race included Gore&#x27;s vote against Everett Dirksen&#x27;s amendment on prayer in public schools, and his opposition to appointing Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell to the U.S. Supreme Court. Brock won the election by a 51% to 47% margin.

===Political legacy===
In 1956, he gained national attention after his disapproval of the Southern Manifesto. Gore voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in fact filibustering against it, although he supported the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Gore was a vocal champion of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, which secured creation of interstate highways. Later, he backed the Great Society array of programs initiated by President Johnson&#x27;s administration, and introduced a bill with a Medicare blueprint. In international politics, he moved from proposing in the House to employ nuclear weapons for establishing a radioactive demilitarized zone during the Korean War, to voting for the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and speaking against the Vietnam War, pivots that likely contributed to the loss of his Senate seat in 1970.

==Personal life==
On May 15, 1937, in Tompkinsville, Kentucky, Gore married lawyer Pauline LaFon (1912–2004), the daughter of Maude (née Gatlin) and Walter L. LaFon. Together, they had two children: Nancy LaFon Gore (1938–1984) and Albert Gore Jr. (born 1948), who followed in his father&#x27;s political footsteps by representing Tennessee as a U.S. Representative and as a Senator, and later served as Vice President of the United States under Bill Clinton.

After leaving Congress, Gore Sr. resumed the practice of law and also taught law at Vanderbilt University. He continued to represent Occidental Petroleum, where he became vice president and member of the board of directors. Gore became chairman of Island Creek Coal Co., Lexington, Kentucky, an Occidental subsidiary, in 1972, and in his last years operated Gore Antique Mall, an antiques store in Carthage. He lived to see his son Albert Gore Jr. become Vice President of the United States. Gore Sr. died on December 5, 1998, at the age of 90 and is buried in Smith County Memorial Gardens in Carthage. The Interstate Highway System in Tennessee is designated the &quot;Senator Albert Gore Sr. Memorial Interstate System&quot; in his honor.

<text>The Honda Fit (Japanese: ホンダ・フィット, Hepburn: &quot;Honda Fitto&quot;) or Honda Jazz is a small car manufactured and marketed by Honda since 2001 over four generations. It has a five-door hatchback body style and is considered a supermini in the United Kingdom, a subcompact car in the United States, and a light car in Australia. Marketed worldwide and manufactured at ten plants in eight countries, sales reached almost 5 million by mid-2013. Honda uses the &quot;Jazz&quot; nameplate in Europe, Oceania, the Middle East, Africa, Hong Kong, Macau, Southeast Asia and India; and &quot;Fit&quot; in Japan, Sri Lanka, China, Taiwan and the Americas.

Sharing Honda&#x27;s global small car platform with the City, Airwave, first-generation Mobilio, Freed and HR-V/Vezel, the Fit is noted for its one-box or monospace design; forward-located fuel tank; configurable seats that fold in several ways to accommodate cargo in varying shapes and sizes— and cargo volume competitive to larger vehicles.

Honda released hybrid petrol-electric versions of the Fit in Japan in October 2010 and in Europe in early 2011. In 2012, Honda released the Fit EV, a limited-production all-electric version based on the second-generation model in the United States and Japan, and was widely regarded as a compliance car.

The fourth-generation model released in 2019 is currently sold in Japan, Europe, China, Taiwan, South Africa, Brunei and Singapore. Starting from 2020, the model was phased out in most Southeast Asian and Latin American countries to be replaced by the larger City Hatchback, while it was withdrawn entirely from the North American market due to falling demand within the subcompact segment.


== First generation (GD/GE; 2001) ==
The first-generation Fit debuted in June 2001 in Japan and subsequently was introduced in Europe (early 2002), Australia (late 2002), South America (early 2003), South Africa and Southeast Asia (2003), China (September 2004), and Mexico (late 2005). Confusingly, in Europe this Jazz is typically referred to as Mark II Jazz, especially by automotive part suppliers, the Mark I Jazz being the 1981-86 Honda City, named &#x27;Jazz&#x27; in Europe at the time, as Opel already had rights to use the City name after having used it on a hatchback version of the Kadett C.

A production model for the United States and Canada debuted in January 2006 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The car was released in Canada and the U.S. in April 2006 as a 2007 model year.

The first-generation Fit uses Honda&#x27;s Global Small Car platform, which is also used by Fit Aria/City (a sedan version of the Fit), the Airwave (a station wagon version of Fit Aria/City), the Mobilio, and Mobilio Spike. Depending on the region, the Fit is available with a 1.2-, 1.3- (in Europe referred as 1.4 L model), 1.5-liter i-DSI engine, or 1.5-liter VTEC engine. All four engines are based on Honda&#x27;s L-series engine family.

== Second generation (GE/GG; 2007) ==
The second-generation Fit/Jazz debuted on 17 October 2007 at the 40th Tokyo Motor Show. At its introduction in 2007, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award for the second time. The vehicle offered a longer wheelbase than its predecessor and is wider and longer overall.

Two engines were offered in the second-generation Fit. A 1.3-litre i-VTEC produces at 6,000 rpm and at 4,800 rpm. A 1.5-litre i-VTEC engine was also offered and produces a maximum output of at 6,600 rpm and at 4,800 rpm. The hybrid version was launched October 2010 in Japan. The Fit Hybrid featured a 1.3-litre engine and electric motor, with an estimated fuel economy of measured in accordance with Japanese 10–15 cycle.

Honda also showed a concept electric vehicle based on the second generation Fit in 2010. It was mass-produced as the Fit EV in 2013–2015. The 2013 model year production Fit EV was unveiled at the November 2011 Los Angeles Auto Show.

For the first time, it was also available in a station wagon body style called the Fit Shuttle. The variant was only available in Japan&#x27;s domestic market.

== Third generation (GK/GH/GP; 2013) ==

The third-generation Fit/Jazz retains the overall design concept of previous generations, notably the center-located fuel tank and multi-configuration interior concept, marketed as &quot;Magic Seat&quot;. The model also debuted Honda&#x27;s updated design language dubbed &quot;Exciting H Design&quot;.

Honda&#x27;s all-new Global Small Car Platform employs ultra-high strength 780 MPa yield steel for 27 percent of the bodywork and has a shorter overall length by , a longer wheelbase, increased rear legroom by and passenger volume increased by compared to the previous generation.

Body panels are both welded and bolted to the frame in a hybrid monocoque and spaceframe fusion — and rear torsion beam suspension is more compact, no longer using an anti-sway bar to maximize interior and cargo space. The second-generation HR-V shares its platform with the third-generation Fit/Jazz.

=== Hybrid ===
The Fit/Jazz Hybrid was only marketed in Japan and Malaysia for the third-generation model. It is the first model to be equipped with the &quot;Sport Hybrid&quot; Intelligent Dual Clutch Drive (i-DCD) system, Honda&#x27;s lightweight and compact one-motor hybrid technology for small vehicles that replaces the previous Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system.

The system uses an Earth Dreams 1.5-liter Atkinson cycle DOHC i-VTEC direct injection engine rated at and paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and an internal high-output motor, IPU (Intelligent Power Unit) with lithium-ion battery, electric servo braking system with variable servo ratio control. The electric motor, a Honda H1 motor, is rated at and . The system is shared with the first-generation Vezel and Grace Hybrid.

Compared to the outgoing IMA hybrid, the new hybrid can now run fully on electric while driving, making it on par with Toyota Prius. Japanese cycle fuel consumption is rated for the initial model, a 35 percent improvement over the predecessor model, while its cargo capacity is 470 liters.

The Canadian trim levels included the DX, LX, EX, and EX-L with Navigation. For the first time, leather seating was introduced to the North American Fit through the EX-L trim. The facelift in 2018 also added the Sport trim which sits between the LX and EX trims, with underbody spoiler, exhaust finisher, and orange stitching to cloth seats. All Fit trim levels included a multi-angle rear-view backup camera; higher trims include dynamic guidelines. Honda&#x27;s LaneWatch passenger side-view mirror camera was also optional.

== Fourth generation (GR/GS; 2020) ==

The fourth-generation Fit/Jazz was unveiled simultaneously on 23 October 2019 in Japan at the 46th Tokyo Motor Show and Amsterdam, Netherlands at the &#x27;Electric Vision&#x27; event.

This generation model has been developed with electrification in mind, with the model being marketed as a hybrid-only model in Europe, and the hybrid variant being positioned as a volume car in Japan. The hybrid powertrain is marketed as the e:HEV which utilizes Honda&#x27;s new dual-motor i-MMD (Intelligent Multi-Mode Drive) hybrid system, replacing the previous Intelligent Dual Clutch Drive (i-DCD) setup.

The fourth-generation Fit retains the large windshield which offers optimal forward visibility, though it has a redesigned front pillar with a cross-sectional structure that differs from the previous generation. Honda stated that it improves impact absorption into the body in the event of a collision. Combined with the use of a flat dashboard and a visor-less instrument display, it provides the driver with a better view of their surroundings. The windscreen wipers have also been hidden below the top of the bonnet line.

The model is not being sold in the North American market due to the declining sales of its predecessor; the HR-V has seen its production being ramped up to compensate for the discontinuation of the Fit. The model is also not being sold in Australia where it had been known as the Jazz. The cost was deemed too high for import, and the small car market has shrunk due to the popularity of small SUVs. In most countries in South America and Southeast Asia, the Fit/Jazz is replaced by the City Hatchback.

==== Taiwan ====

=== Powertrain ===
The fourth-generation Fit is offered with a new hybrid powertrain option marketed as the e:HEV, the system uses Honda&#x27;s dual-motor i-MMD (Intelligent Multi-Mode Drive) hybrid system. The system combines a 1.5-litre DOHC i-VTEC four-cylinder petrol engine that on its own makes from 5,600 to 6,400 rpm and from 4,500 to 5,000 rpm with two electric motors, with one of them acting as a generator to recharge the lithium-ion battery while the other is an electric propulsion motor capable of spinning at 13,300 rpm to handle low-speed acceleration. The engine sends power to the front wheels through a single fixed-gear ratio and a lock-up clutch, which is claimed to provide a smoother transfer of torque during acceleration. The setup is claimed to be more compact and refined compared to a planetary eCVT typically found in other hybrid vehicles. The system is rated at and of torque.

The conventional petrol engine for the Japanese market is 1.3-litre naturally-aspirated i-VTEC four-cylinder, making 98 PS at 6,000 rpm and 118 Nm of torque at 5,000 rpm. It is mated to a CVT and a choice of either front or all-wheel drive.


==Sales==
Japanese sales of the first-generation Fit greatly exceeded the original monthly sales target of 8,000 units on debut. By December 2001, it had outsold the Toyota Corolla, and ranked first in sales for nine out of twelve months in 2002. With a total sales of 250,790 for the year of 2002, it became the best-selling vehicle in Japan, which is a first for a Honda model. By September 2003, a little more than two years after the car was first sold, Fit reached 500,000 sales in Japanese market.

After a minor model change that went on sale on June 11, 2004, Honda announced that, in about two weeks&#x27; period after its introduction, the company received orders from customers totaled around 13,000 units. By November 2007, in less than six months after minor model change, cumulative sales of Fit reached one million units in Japan.

The second generation has been the top selling car in Japan since its official launch in November 2007. By September 2010, cumulative sales in Japan reached 1.5 million units.

By December 2004, cumulative global sales of Fit/Jazz reached 1 million units. On July 17, 2007, Honda announced that as of the end of June more than 2 million Fit/Jazz units had been sold worldwide since its introduction. Japan accounts for the largest percentage of sales, with 962,000 units sold in the home market. Europe is next with 417,000 units. The United States accounts for 77,000 cars since introduction in 2006. Honda expected to sell 33,000 vehicles in the U.S. for the 2007 model year, but exceeded these expectations, and sold 40,000. Honda plans to put 70,000 Fit units on American roads for the 2008 model year.

In the first half of 2008, Honda and other manufacturers were surprised by the rapid shift towards smaller cars in the United States. Sales of the Fit during the first five months of the year jumped 64% compared with that of 2007. Production of 2009 Fit for the U.S. market was to increase from 60,000 to 80,000 cars. Further increase in supply for the U.S. market is limited by Honda&#x27;s production capacity of 500,000 a year for all markets.

Honda announced that by the end of July 2009, worldwide sales of Fit/Jazz reached 3 million. One year later, global cumulative sales reached 3.5 million units in July 2010.

===Marketing===
Honda planned to use the name &quot;Fitta&quot;, and it was planned to be released in Japan under that name in 2001. Because &quot;Fitta&quot; in Scandinavian languages is vulgar slang for vagina, Honda instead used &quot;Jazz&quot; in most markets and &quot;Fit&quot; in the Americas.

In April 2006, Honda Australia promoted Honda Jazz with Village Green, an animated television commercial, in 30 second and 60 second versions, inspired by Thomas the Tank Engine. In the same month, American Honda launched the Fit with six five-second and two 30-second TV ads, with the slogan &#x27;The Fit Is Go&#x27;.

Subsequent ad campaigns included &quot;Mecha-Mosquitoes,&quot; (broke 9/21) &quot;Defense Mechanism&quot; (breaks 10/2) and &quot;Bats&quot; (breaks 9/28), produced by Digital Domain. As part of the campaign, the vehicle also appeared in &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, &quot;90210&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot; and &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;. Print ads &quot;Gas Hogs&quot; and &quot;Cavernous&quot; were featured in popular magazines. A dedicated marketing site was built to communicate top product features through games and interactive experiences. The campaign continued the slogan &#x27;The Fit Is Go&#x27;.

<text>The S5G reactor was a prototype naval reactor designed for the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on submarines. The S5G designation stands for:

* S = Submarine platform
* 5 = Fifth generation core designed by the contractor
* G = General Electric was the contracted designer

== Design ==
The S5G was a pressurized water reactor plant with two coolant loops and two steam generators. It had to be designed with the reactor vessel situated low in the boat and the steam generators high in order for natural circulation of the primary coolant to be developed and maintained.

Reactor primary coolant pumps are one of the primary sources of noise from submarines, and the elimination of coolant pumps and associated equipment would also reduce mechanical complexity and the space required by propulsion equipment.

The S5G had primary coolant pumps, but they were only needed for very high speeds. And since the reactor core was designed with very smooth paths for the coolant, the coolant pumps were smaller and quieter than the ones used by the competing S5W core. They were also fewer in number. In most cases the submarine could be operated without using coolant pumps at all. The quiet design resulted in a larger hull diameter but required larger primary coolant piping than the competing S5W reactor. Due to the larger size, the S5G was not used in subsequent attack submarines, but was a precursor to the S8G reactor design used in the larger s.

To further reduce engine plant noise, the normal propulsion setup of two steam turbines driving the screw through a reduction gear unit was changed instead to one large propulsion turbine with no reduction gears. This eliminated the noise from the main reduction gears, but the cost was to have a huge main propulsion turbine. The turbine was cylindrical, about 12 feet in diameter, and about 30 feet long. This massive size was necessary to allow it to turn slowly enough to directly drive the screw and be fairly efficient in doing so. The same propulsion setup was used on both USS &quot;Narwhal&quot; and the land-based prototype.

The concept of a natural circulation plant was relatively new when the Navy requested this design. The prototype plant in Idaho was therefore given quite a rigorous performance shakedown to determine if such a design would work for the US Navy. It was largely a success, although the design never became the basis for any more fast-attack submarines besides the &quot;Narwhal&quot;. The prototype testing included the simulation of essentially the entire engine room of an attack submarine. Floating the plant in a large pool of water allowed the prototype to be rotated along its long axis to simulate a hard turn, accomplished by torquing large gyroscopes mounted forward of the reactor compartment. This was necessary to determine whether natural circulation would continue even during hard turns, since natural circulation is dependent on gravity whereas submarines are known to maneuver at various angles.

== History ==
This nuclear reactor was installed both at a land-based prototype—initially used for testing the concept and, later, for training thousands of Navy operators—at the Naval Reactor Facility, Idaho National Laboratory near Arco, Idaho, and in the USS &quot;Narwhal&quot; (SSN-671); both have been decommissioned. It was intended to test the potential contribution of natural circulation technology to submarine quieting.

Built in the early 1960s, the S5G prototype was permanently shut down in May 1995.

<text>USS &quot;Narwhal&quot; (SSN-671), a unique submarine, was the third vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the narwhal, a gray and white arctic whale with a unicorn-like, ivory tusk.

Her keel was laid down on 17 January 1966 by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation, in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 9 September 1967 sponsored by Vice admiral Glynn R. Donaho (ret.), and commissioned on 12 July 1969.

== Design ==
A unique design under project SCB 245, &quot;Narwhal&quot; was her own class. Forward of the reactor compartment she was broadly similar to the contemporary submarines, but with a slightly larger diameter and the relocation of the auxiliary diesel generator from the bow compartment to the auxiliary machine room in the operations compartment. Her reactor compartment and engine room were unlike those of previous classes due to her unique natural circulation S5G reactor and direct-drive turbine propulsion plant. Access to the engine room was provided by two separate reactor tunnels, each with their own watertight doors.

&quot;Narwhal&quot;″s design featured several innovative quieting features, including:

*a natural circulation S5G reactor plant;
*less powerful main coolant pumps which had two speeds: On and Off;
*scoop seawater injection for the main condensers, allowing the main seawater pumps to be shut off at speed
*the ability to cross-connect main and auxiliary seawater systems;
*a large, direct-drive propulsion turbine which operated at a low shaft speed (300 RPM) and did not require reduction gears;
*ship service turbine generators which operated at a lower RPM (1,200 RPM vs. 3,600 RPM of previous classes);
*elimination of the waist ballast tanks which eliminated vibration noise caused by the thin outer hull.

The result was the quietest submarine of her era. Although successful, her propulsion plant had several issues. The propulsion turbine had to be very large to operate at such a low shaft speed, and required a complex warm-up and cooldown procedure. Her turbine generators experienced blade failures in tests due to their low rotational speed, and improvements in noise reduction techniques allowed the turbine generators of subsequent classes to operate at high speed (3,600 RPM) while remaining as quiet as those on &quot;Narwhal&quot;. Her seawater injection piping required large hull penetrations and long piping runs under full submergence pressure. Because this system was not compatible with SUBSAFE regulations, it was not repeated on subsequent classes. Other quieting features would be incorporated on subsequent submarine designs, and &quot;Narwhal&quot;″s S5G reactor would be scaled up and doubled in power to become the S8G reactor that propels the .

&quot;Narwhal&quot; was fitted with a &quot;turtleback&quot; structure just forward of her rudder that may have been used for remote-controlled underwater vehicles, or for housing an experimental towed sonar array.

== Career ==
Little information about &quot;Narwhal&quot;″s career is available, but it was eventful and included a very heavy deployment rate interrupted only by three overhauls (two involving reactor refueling). &quot;Narwhal&quot; had few difficulties in Arctic waters, easily shadowing Soviet vessels. Those deployments earned &quot;Narwhal&quot; a Navy Unit Commendation for a 1972 deployment, and Meritorious Unit Commendations for operations in 1971, 1977, 1979, 1994, and 1998. She also earned the Battle Efficiency E (five awards), the Engineering E (four awards), and the Anti-Submarine Warfare A, the Communications C, and the Supply E. She may have also been used for special operations duty.

&quot;Narwhal&quot; sustained minor damage on 22 September 1989 when Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, South Carolina. She was moored with nine double wires and two three-inch ship&#x27;s lines in preparation for the storm. All but one of the lines parted during the first half of the storm, and she drifted into the Cooper River. Tugboats and &quot;Narwhal&quot;″s crew tried unsuccessfully to move the submarine back to the pier before the second half of the storm. As the storm resumed, &quot;Narwhal&quot; submerged in the river and rode out the remainder of the hurricane with only part of her sail exposed.

In 1993, Navigator Harley O&#x27;Neill organized a reunion with the original 167 &quot;Narwhal&quot; crew from WWII. While there were three generations of &quot;Narwhal&quot; Submarines, (67, 167 and 671), over a single weekend, O&#x27;Neill managed to host and entertain both the 2nd generation as well as the third generation &quot;Narwhal&quot; crew on board as the special guests to his Capt. Lincoln and his command.

&quot;Narwhal&quot; was deactivated, while still in commission, on 16 January 1999 in Norfolk, Virginia. She was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1999, and entered the Navy&#x27;s Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program (NPSSRP) in Bremerton, Washington on 1 October 2001. Over the next five years, efforts were made to make &quot;Narwhal&quot; the centerpiece of a planned National Submarine Science Discovery Center (NSSDC) in Newport, Kentucky. Legislation signed on 30 September 2003 authorized the Secretary of the Navy to transfer &quot;Narwhal&quot; to the NSSDC. The nuclear reactor and propulsion equipment would be removed and replaced with a plug of the proper dimensions and shape, containing a theater and classroom. However, on 26 April 2006, Peter Kay, board chair of the NSSDC, announced the cancellation of the exhibit, as fundraising had only raised $0.5 million of the $2 million needed. The boat was subsequently dismantled by October 2020 per the Navy&#x27;s Ship-Submarine Recycling Program.

<text>The Extended-range Twin-engine Operations Performance Standards (ETOPS) () are safety standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for twin-engine commercial passenger aircraft operations. They are a safety measure intended to ensure that in the event of a single engine failure, an aircraft will still be able to reach a diversion airport using the remaining operational engine. This may be at a reduced speed and/or height, and usually applies to flights over water or remote lands, typically routes previously restricted to three- and four-engine aircraft.

== History ==

In 1936, the predecessor to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the U.S. Bureau of Air Commerce, restricted commercial operations within United States airspace to within of an adequate airport. For many aircraft of that era this meant about 60 minutes with one engine inoperative.

In 1953, with piston engine reliability and aircraft performance improved, U.S. authorities introduced a &quot;60-minute rule&quot;, restricting twin-engine aircraft to a 60-minute diversion area (at single-engine cruise speed). There was some additional flexibility beyond this limit with special approval. Meanwhile, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recommended a 90-minute diversion time for all aircraft, which was adopted by many regulatory authorities and airlines outside the US.

During the 1950s, Pan Am twin-engine Convair 240s flew across the Caribbean from Barranquilla, Colombia to Kingston, Jamaica, Avensa Convair 340s flew from Maracaibo, Venezuela to Montego Bay, Jamaica, KLM Douglas DC-3s flew Curacao to Ciudad Trujillo while KLM Convairs flew Aruba to Kingston with Delta Air Lines operating Convair 340 flights nonstop between New Orleans and Havana as well as nonstop between Havana and Montego Bay and also on a routing of Havana – Port au Prince – Ciudad Trujillo – San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1948–52 New Zealand National Airways Corporation scheduled a DC-3 to fly from Apia (Western Samoa) to Aitutaki, a -hour flight covering 685 airportless nautical miles between Tafuna (Pago Pago) and Aitutaki. In 1963 Polynesian Airlines started flying a Percival Prince Apia to Aitutaki; in 1964 the flight was a DC-3 from Faleolo (Upolu) to Aitutaki, a distance of . More recently, the January 1979 OAG showed a weekly Polynesian Airlines HS748 from Niue to Rarotonga, with no airport.

In 2017 ICAO issued Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS) for ETOPS, and ETOPS were extended to four-engine aircraft like the Boeing 747-8 and the terminology updated to EDTO (Extended Diversion Time Operations).

=== Early jet airliners ===
While the earliest jet engines were sometimes unreliable, widespread use of later engines such as the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D (e.g. McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and Boeing 737) led to major advances in reliability and safety. As jet engines started to deliver more power than piston engines while increasing reliability, aircraft whose size previously required four piston engines could now be built using only two jet engines.

By the late 1960s, most large civil airliners were jet-powered, relegating the piston engine to roles such as cargo flights. With the JT8D reliably powering the three-engine Boeing 727, the 60-minute rule was waived in 1964 for three-engine aircraft, which in turn opened the way for the development of wide-body, intercontinental trijets such as the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar and McDonnell Douglas DC-10. By then, only twin-engine jets were restricted by the 60-minute rule. Trijets and quadjets dominated international long-haul flights until the late 1980s.

=== Early ETOPS ===

Airbus A300 twinjets, the first twin-engine wide-body aircraft, had been flying across the North Atlantic, the Bay of Bengal, and the Indian Ocean under a 90-minute ICAO rule since 1976.

When the FAA director J. Lynn Helms in 1980 was approached about the possibility of an exemption, his response was &quot;It&#x27;ll be a cold day in hell before I let twins fly long haul, overwater routes.&quot; The Boeing 767-200ER entered service in 1984.

In 1985, the FAA increased the ETOPS to 120 minutes at the single-engine cruise speed. Trans World Airlines operated the first 120-minute ETOPS (ETOPS-120) service on February 1, 1985, with a Boeing 767-200 from Boston to Paris. The 767 burned less fuel per hour than a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar on the same route, prompting TWA to spend $2.6 million on each 767 they owned to retrofit them to ETOPS-120 specs.
It was followed by Singapore Airlines in June with an Airbus A310.
In April 1986, Pan Am inaugurated transatlantic revenue service using A310s, and within five years Airbus ETOPS operators numbered more than 20.

=== ETOPS 180 ===

In 1988, the FAA amended the ETOPS regulation to allow the extension to a 180-minute diversion period, subject to stringent technical and operational qualifications. ETOPS-180 and ETOPS-207 cover about 95% of the Earth. The first such flight was conducted in 1989. This set of regulations was subsequently adopted by the JAA, ICAO, and other regulatory bodies.

=== ETOPS 180 at introduction ===
The original 1985 regulations allowed an airliner to have ETOPS-120 rating on entry into service. ETOPS-180 was only possible after one year of trouble-free 120-minute ETOPS experience. In 1990 Boeing convinced the FAA that it could deliver an airliner with ETOPS-180 on its entry into service. This process was called Early ETOPS. The Boeing 777 was the first aircraft to be introduced with an ETOPS rating of 180 minutes.

In the 1990s, the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) demurred, and the Boeing 777 was rated ETOPS-120 on its entry into service in Europe. European airlines operating the 777 had to demonstrate one year of trouble-free 120-minute ETOPS experience before obtaining 180-minute ETOPS for the 777.

=== Beyond ETOPS-180 ===

Effective February 15, 2007, the FAA ruled that US-registered twin-engine airplane operators can fly more than 180-minute ETOPS to the design limit of the aircraft. In November 2009, the Airbus A330 became the first aircraft to receive ETOPS-240 approval, which has since been offered by Airbus as an option.

ETOPS-240 and beyond are now permitted on a case-by-case basis, with regulatory bodies in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand adopting said regulatory extension. Authority is only granted to operators of two-engine airplanes between specific city pairs. The certificate holder must have been operating at 180-minute or greater ETOPS authority for at least 24 consecutive months, of which at least 12 consecutive months must be at 240-minute ETOPS authority with the airplane-engine combination in the application.

On December 12, 2011, Boeing received type-design approval from the FAA for up to 330-minute extended operations for its Boeing 777 series, all equipped with GE engines, and with Rolls-Royce and Pratt &amp; Whitney engines expected to follow. The first ETOPS-330 flight took place on December 1, 2015, with Air New Zealand connecting Auckland to Buenos Aires on a 777-200ER. On May 28, 2014, the Boeing 787 received its ETOPS-330 certificate from the FAA, enabling LAN Airlines (now known as LATAM Airlines) to switch to the 787 from the A340 on their Santiago–Auckland–Sydney service a year later.
Until the rule change in North America and Oceania, several commercial airline routes were still economically off-limits to twinjets because of ETOPS regulations, unless the route was specifically conducted as indivertible. There were routes traversing the Southern hemisphere, e.g., South Pacific (e.g., Sydney–Santiago, one of the longest over-the-sea distances flown by a commercial airline), South Atlantic (e.g., Johannesburg–São Paulo), Southern Indian Ocean (e.g., Perth–Johannesburg), and Antarctica.

Before the introduction of the Airbus A350XWB in 2014, regulations in North America and Europe permitted up to 180-minute ETOPS at entry. The A350 XWB was first to receive an ETOPS-370 prior to entry into service by European authorities. The A350 XWB&#x27;s current ETOPS certification covers 99.7% of the Earth&#x27;s entire surface, allowing point-to-point travel anywhere in the world except directly over the South Pole.

Meanwhile, the first time that ETOPS-330 approval was given to a four-engine aircraft was in February 2015, to the Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental. It is the only ETOPS-compliant aircraft allowed to run non-stop overflights over Antarctica with proper alternates, alongside the Airbus A340 and A380.

==Usage==

The North Atlantic Tracks are the most heavily used oceanic routes in the world, and are largely covered by ETOPS 120-minute rules, thereby removing the necessity of using 180-minute rules. However, North Atlantic diversion airports are subject to adverse weather conditions that affect their availability for use. As a result, the JAA and FAA have given 15% extension to the 120-minute rules to deal with such contingencies, resulting to ETOPS-138 (i.e. 138 minutes) to allow ETOPS flights with such airports closed. By the mid-2010s, virtually all North Atlantic plane routes were dominated by twin-engine aircraft.

During the Cold War, routes between Europe and East Asia were prohibited from flying over Soviet Union or China since both airspaces were previously heavily military-controlled. Virtually all flights between Europe and East Asia flew over the United States, often with a tank stop in Anchorage, Alaska. They flew near the North Pole with a very large distance to usable airports, for which only three- and four-engine wide-body aircraft were permitted for safety reasons by international aviation authorities. Some flights between Europe and Oceania still largely pass through stopovers in Asia (either in the Middle East or Southeast Asia) or North America (either in Canada or the U.S.) given the current aircraft range restrictions and, in the case of the early and mid-2020s, the reinstatement of selected routes by airlines between the Western Hemisphere and Eastern Hemisphere bypassing Russia due to its ongoing war with Ukraine.

For decades, narrow-body aircraft like the Airbus A320 series, and the Boeing 737 series and 757 have continuously operated flights as approved for ETOPS operation, alongside earlier wide-body aircraft such as the A300 and A310, and Boeing 767. The success of ETOPS aircraft like A300 and Boeing 767 made the intercontinental trijets obsolete for passenger use, production of which was largely ended by the late 2000s with Boeing cancelling the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 program in the same period.

The rules have also allowed American legacy carriers (United Airlines and Delta Air Lines in particular) to use the Boeing 757 on &quot;long and thin&quot; transatlantic routes between their major hubs and secondary European cities that cannot generate the passenger demand to justify the use of a widebody airliner. The practice has been controversial, because although the 757 has adequate range to cross the Atlantic Ocean comfortably, strong headwinds caused by the jetstream over the winter months can result in westbound flights being declared &quot;minimum fuel&quot;, forcing a refuelling stop at Gander, Newfoundland, in order to safely complete their journey.

Aloha Airlines operated 180-minute ETOPS–approved Boeing 737-700 aircraft on nonstop routes between the Hawaiian Islands and the western U.S. and also Vancouver, Canada. The use of the smaller 737-700 enabled Aloha to serve routes that could not support larger jet aircraft with an example being the Honolulu – Burbank nonstop route. Prior to the 737-700 operation, Aloha Airlines had operated 737-200 aircraft to various Pacific islands utilizing 120 minute ETOPS.

Other new-generation ETOPS aircraft include the Airbus A220 series, the Embraer E-Jets series and the ATR 72. By the mid-2010s, the widespread successes of ETOPS-reliant narrow-body aircraft have diminished the global market share of double-deck wide-body jets. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the early 2020s, Boeing and Airbus have since ended all production of the 747 and A380, respectively (and both being the two largest commercial aircraft in the world). At the same time, the increasing prominence of new-generation ultra-long-range wide-body twinjets like the Boeing 777 and 787, and Airbus A330 and A350 over the last decade has shifted the favor from quadjets to twinjets for international long-haul travel.

== Approval process ==
The cornerstone of the ETOPS approach is the statistics showing that the turbine assembly of a modern jet engine is an inherently reliable component. Engine ancillaries, by contrast, have a lower reliability rating. Therefore, an ETOPS-certified engine may be built with duplicate sets of certain ancillaries in order to receive the required reliability rating.

ETOPS approval is a two-step process. First, the airframe and engine combination must satisfy the basic ETOPS requirements during its type certification. This is called &quot;ETOPS type approval&quot;. Such tests may include shutting down an engine and flying the remaining engine during the complete diversion time. Often such tests are performed in the middle of the ocean. It must be demonstrated that, during the diversion flight, the flight crew is not unduly burdened by extra workload due to the lost engine and that the probability of the remaining engine failing is extremely remote. For example, if an aircraft is rated for ETOPS-180, it means that it is able to fly with full load and just one engine for three hours.

Second, an operator who conducts ETOPS flights must satisfy their own country&#x27;s aviation regulators about their ability to conduct ETOPS flights. This is called &quot;ETOPS operational certification&quot; and involves compliance with additional special engineering and flight crew procedures in addition to the normal engineering and flight procedures. Pilots and engineering staff must be qualified and trained for ETOPS. An airline with extensive experience operating long-distance flights may be awarded ETOPS operational approval immediately, while others may need to demonstrate ability through a series of ETOPS proving flights.

Regulators closely watch the ETOPS performance of both type certificate holders and their affiliated airlines. Any technical incidents during an ETOPS flight must be recorded. From the data collected, the reliability of the particular airframe-engine combination is measured and statistics published. The figures must be within limits of type certifications. Of course, the figures required for ETOPS-180 will always be more stringent than ETOPS-120. Unsatisfactory figures would lead to a downgrade or, worse, suspension of ETOPS capabilities either for the type certificate holder or the airline.

Engines must have an in-flight shutdown (IFSD) rate better than 1 per 20,000 hours for ETOPS-120, 1 per 50,000 hours for ETOPS-180, and 
1 per 100,000 hours for beyond ETOPS-180.

Private jets are exempted from ETOPS by the FAA, but are subject to the ETOPS 120-minute rule in EASA&#x27;s jurisdiction.

Government-owned aircraft (including military) do not have to adhere to ETOPS regulations.

== Ratings ==

There are different levels of ETOPS certification, each allowing aircraft to fly on routes that are a certain amount of single-engine flying time away from the nearest suitable airport. For example, if an aircraft is certified for 180 minutes, it is permitted to fly any route not more than 180 minutes&#x27; single-engine flying time to the nearest suitable airport.

The following ratings are awarded under current regulations according to the capability of the airliner:
* ETOPS-75
* ETOPS-90
* ETOPS-120/138
* ETOPS-180/207
* ETOPS-240
* ETOPS-270
* ETOPS-330
* ETOPS-370

However, ratings for ETOPS type approval are fewer. They are:
* ETOPS-90
* ETOPS-120/138
* ETOPS-180/207, which covers 95% of the Earth&#x27;s surface.
* ETOPS-&gt;180 to design limit

==Designation==

Until the mid-1980s, the term EROPS (extended range operations) was used before being superseded by ETOPS usage. In 1997, when Boeing proposed to extend ETOPS authority for twins to beyond 180 minutes, Airbus proposed to replace ETOPS by a newer system, referred to as Long Range Operational Performance Standards (LROPS), which would affect all civil airliners, not just those with a twin-engine configuration with more than 180 minutes ETOPS.

===US FAA ===

The FAA stated in the Federal Register in 2007:
This final rule applies to air carrier (part 121), commuter, and on-demand (part 135) turbine powered multi-engine airplanes used in extended-range operations. However, all-cargo operations in airplanes with more than two engines of both part 121 and part 135 are exempted from the majority of this rule. Today&#x27;s rule [January 16, 2007] establishes regulations governing the design, operation and maintenance of certain airplanes operated on flights that fly long distances from an adequate airport. This final rule codifies current FAA policy, industry best practices and recommendations, as well as international standards designed to ensure long-range flights will continue to operate safely.&quot; and Several commenters … recommended use of the acronym &quot;LROPS&quot;—meaning &#x27;Long Range Operations&#x27;—for three- and four-engine ETOPS, to avoid confusion, particularly for those operations beyond 180 minutes&#x27; diversion time. The FAA has decided to use the single term, &#x27;extended operations,&#x27; or ETOPS, for all affected operations regardless of the number of engines on the airplane.&quot;

Prior to 2007, the FAA used the term for &quot;Extended Range Operation with Two-Engine Airplanes&quot; but the meaning was changed when regulations were broadened to include aircraft with more than two engines.
===EDTO – Extended Diversion Time Operations===
In 2017 ICAO amendment 36 to Part I of Annex 6 of the Chicago Convention replaced the term ETOPS with the new term EDTO (Extended Diversion Time Operations). The main reason of this change in the terminology was to better reflect the scope and applicability of these new standards.

===Backronym===

A colloquial aviation backronym is &quot;Engines Turn Or Passengers Swim&quot;, referring to the inevitable emergency water landing of a twin engine aircraft after a double engine failure over water outside gliding range of land.

<text>USS &quot;Corvina&quot; (SS-226), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the corvina.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Corvina&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut, on 21 September 1942. She was launched on 9 May 1943, sponsored by Mrs. LaRene P. Christie, wife of Rear Admiral Ralph. W. Christie, commander of submarine operations in Fremantle, Australia, and commissioned on 6 August 1943.

==Service record==

Clearing New London, Connecticut, on 18 September 1943, &quot;Corvina &quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 14 October. She put out from Pearl Harbor on her maiden war patrol 4 November, topped up her fuel tanks at Johnston Island two days later, and was never heard from again. Her commanding officer was Roderick S. Rooney.

Her assignment had been a dangerous one: to patrol as closely as possible to the heavily guarded stronghold of Truk and to intercept any Japanese sortie endangering the forthcoming American invasion of the Gilbert Islands. Japanese records report that Japanese submarine &quot;I-176&quot; launched three torpedoes at an enemy submarine south of Truk on 16 November, claiming two hits which resulted in the explosion of the target. Her loss with her crew of 82 was announced 14 March 1944, making &quot;Corvina&quot; the only American submarine to have been sunk by a Japanese submarine in the entire war.

==In popular culture==

The 1951 John Wayne film &quot;Operation Pacific&quot; makes reference to the loss of &quot;Corvina&quot;. In the film, the fictitious &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine USS &quot;Thunderfish&quot; makes an impromptu rendezvous with &quot;Corvina&quot; after &quot;Corvina&quot; reported problems with her Number 4 diesel engine. The submarines exchange engine parts and the commanding officers also exchange films, Lieutenant Commander Duke E. Gifford (played by Wayne) offering &quot;George Washington Slept Here&quot; and &quot;Corvina&quot;′s captain offering &quot;a submarine picture,&quot; later revealed to be the 1943 film &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot;. Later, while the crew of &quot;Thunderfish&quot; is watching &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot;, Gifford tries to figure out the source of torpedo explosions reported by &quot;Thunderfish&quot;′s sonar operator. The following day, &quot;Thunderfish&quot; comes across wreckage, and discovers the case containing &quot;George Washington Slept Here&quot;, revealing that &quot;Corvina&quot; had been sunk. &quot;Thunderfish&quot;′s radar then reports a single contact, and the submarine submerges. Gifford discovers &quot;one I-type Jap submarine&quot; while looking through the periscope. &quot;Thunderfish&quot; then engages, torpedoes, and sinks the Japanese submarine, avenging the loss of &quot;Corvina&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Lancetfish&quot; (SS-296), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the lancetfish (&quot;Alepisaurus ferox&quot;), a large voracious, deep sea fish having long lancetlike teeth and a high long dorsal fin.

Her keel was laid down on 30 September 1942 by Cramp Shipbuilding Company of Philadelphia. She was launched on 15 August 1943 sponsored by Miss Beatrice P. Barker, towed to Boston Navy Yard 19 May 1944 for completion, and commissioned 12 February 1945.

While tied up alongside Pier 8, &quot;Lancetfish&quot; flooded through an aft torpedo tube and sank 15 March 1945. She was raised eight days later and decommissioned 24 March. Assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet in uncompleted condition, she was transferred to the First Naval District 27 February 1947 and was assigned to the New London Group 9 December 1952. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 9 June 1958 and sold for scrap for $57,189 on 20 August 1959 having never gone to sea on patrol, to Yale Waste Company, Boston, Massachusetts.

Although &quot;Lancetfish&quot; was commissioned at the time of her sinking, she never saw active service, and she is not counted among the 52 American submarines lost during World War II.

<text>USS &quot;Ulua&quot; (SS-428), a , was the only ship of the United States Navy named for the ulua, an important food fish of the tropical Pacific Ocean. She was never completed.

&quot;Ulua&quot;″s keel was laid down on 13 November 1943 at Philadelphia by the Cramp Shipbuilding Company, but the curtailment of U.S. Navy construction programs in the closing days of World War II resulted in the suspension of further construction on 12 August 1945.

The partly completed submarine was launched on 23 April 1946 and towed to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, for maintenance prior to beginning her career as a test hull. Towed to Norfolk, Virginia, in 1951, she participated in tests to gather research data on new weapon and submarine design. &quot;Ulua&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register list on 12 June 1958. Her hulk was sold for scrap on 30 September 1958 to the Portsmouth Salvage Company, Inc.

<text>USS &quot;Runner&quot; (SS/AGSS-476), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the runner, an amberfish inhabiting subtropical waters.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Runner&quot;′ s keel was laid down on 10 July 1944 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 17 October 1944, sponsored by Mrs. R. H. Bass, the wife of the prospective commanding officer, and commissioned on 6 February 1945.

==Service history==
===World War II===

After shakedown and preliminary training off the United States East Coast, &quot;Runner&quot; departed New London, Connecticut, on 5 April 1945, conducted intensive training at Key West, Florida, and Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 21 May 1945. Her first war patrol of World War II was off the east coast of Honshū, Japan, where her primary mission was to scout for the presence of defensive minefields guarding the Japanese Home Islands. On 10 July 1945, while on patrol in the Sea of Japan, she intercepted two worthwhile Japanese targets, a tanker and a minesweeper. The tanker and her two escorts escaped the spread of torpedoes &quot;Runner&quot; fired at them, but three of &quot;Runner&quot;&#x27;s torpedoes splintered the minesweeper &quot;W-27&quot;. Before departing station, &quot;Runner&quot; took aboard 16 downed aviators from the submarines and for transfer to Guam, where &quot;Runner&quot; concluded her patrol with her arrival on 24 July 1945.

&quot;Runner&quot;′s second war patrol began a week prior to the Japanese capitulation on 15 August 1945, and by the time she arrived on station off the east coast of Honshū, peace had come. &quot;Runner&quot;, with ten other U.S. Navy submarines, entered Tokyo Bay on 31 August 1945 and represented the U.S. Navy submarine service at the formal surrender ceremonies on 2 September 1945.

===Post-World War II===
&quot;Runner&quot; and the other submarines in Tokyo Bay departed Japan on 3 September 1945, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 12 September. She continued east until reaching New London on 6 October 1945 . A few weeks later, in company with other vessels of Submarine Squadron 6, &quot;Runner&quot; proceeded south, arriving for duty at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on 14 February 1946. For the next three years, she was based at the Panama Canal Zone and participated in annual fleet exercises in the Caribbean Sea.

In June 1949, &quot;Runner&quot; was reassigned to Norfolk, Virginia, her base for the next seven years. In the autumn of 1957, she participated in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) exercises in the North Atlantic Ocean, visiting ports in France and England. Home-ported in San Juan, Puerto Rico, from July 1958 to July 1959, she operated in the Caribbean Sea as a Regulus missile guidance submarine.
Returning to Norfolk in July 1959, &quot;Runner&quot; operated with the fleet along the U.S. East Coast for the next three years. She deployed to the Mediterranean Sea from January to early May 1962, operating with United States and NATO units. She spent the remainder of 1962 on local antisubmarine warfare exercises and overhaul.

Throughout 1963 and 1964, &quot;Runner&quot; engaged in various antisubmarine warfare exercises in the western Atlantic. She spent the summer of 1964 in the Great Lakes, training United States Naval Reserve personnel. After operating with the fleet in the spring of 1965, she entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia, for overhaul. In 1966, her operations included services for antisubmarine warfare exercises, type training, and participation in Exercise Springboard in the early spring. &quot;Runner&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea with the United States Sixth Fleet from 8 July to 28 October 1966. She spent most of 1967 on school services for future submariners.

&quot;Runner&quot; began 1968 by providing services for the Underwater Demolition Team school at Little Creek, Virginia, and antisubmarine warfare training off the U.S. East Coast. On 4 April 1968, she departed on her last Mediterranean Sea deployment. She returned to Norfolk on 31 July 1968 having visited ports in Spain and Portugal, and participating in the NATO exercise Dawn Patrol.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
On 25 January 1969, &quot;Runner&quot; was decommissioned at the Boston Naval Shipyard in Boston, Massachusetts, and towed to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station in Lake County, Illinois, where she was reclassified as an &quot;auxiliary submarine,&quot; redesignated AGSS-476, and served as a Naval Reserve Training vessel until stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 December 1971. She was sold for scrap on 19 June 1973.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Runner&quot; received one battle star for World War II service.

<doc id="417170" wikidata="Q1138595" url="?curid=417170" title="Cush (Bible)">
<text>Cush or Kush ( &quot;Kūš&quot;; ), according to the Hebrew Bible, was the oldest son of Ham and a grandson of Noah. He was the brother of Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan. Cush was the father of Nimrod.

Cush is traditionally considered the ancestor of the &quot;Land of Cush&quot;, an ancient territory believed to have been located near the Red Sea. Cush is identified in the Bible with the Kingdom of Kush or ancient Aethiopia. The Cushitic languages are named after Cush.

==Identification==
Cush is a Hebrew name that is possibly derived from &quot;Kash&quot;, the Egyptian name of Upper Nubia and later of the Nubian kingdom at Napata, known as the Kingdom of Kush. Alternatively the biblical name may be a mistranslation of the Mesopotamian city of Kish.

The form &quot;Kush&quot; appears in Egyptian records as early as the reign of Mentuhotep II (21st century BC), in an inscription detailing his campaigns against the Nubian region. At the time of the compilation of the Hebrew Bible, and throughout classical antiquity, the Nubian kingdom was centered at Meroë in the modern-day nation of Sudan.

Biblical scholar Kevin Burrell argues that Cush in the Table of Nations should be identified with Meluhha, a placename originally referring to a region east of Mesopotamia but which starting from the mid-2nd millennium BC onwards became equated with the territory of Kush in Nubia. According to Burrell, this explains both Cush&#x27;s Mesopotamian connections in the biblical narrative through his son Nimrod and the fact that his name derives from a Nubian kingdom.

==References in Bible==
Cush&#x27;s sons were Nimrod, Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtechah.

==Traditional identifications==
Josephus gives an account of the nation of Cush, son of Ham and grandson of Noah: &quot;For of the four sons of Ham, time has not at all hurt the name of Cush; for the Ethiopians, over whom he reigned, are even at this day, both by themselves and by all men in Asia, called Cushites&quot; (&quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; 1.6).

The Book of Numbers 12:1 calls a wife of Moses &quot;a Cushite woman&quot;, whereas Moses&#x27;s wife Zipporah is usually described as hailing from Midian. Ezekiel the Tragedian&#x27;s &quot;Exagoge&quot; 60-65 (fragments reproduced in Eusebius) has Zipporah describe herself as a stranger in Midian, and proceeds to describe the inhabitants of her ancestral lands in North Africa:
&quot;Stranger, this land is called Libya. It is inhabited by tribes of various peoples, Ethiopians, dark men. One man is the ruler of the land: he is both king and general. He rules the state, judges the people, and is priest. This man is my father and theirs.&quot;

During the 5th century AD, Arameann and Assyrian Christian writers sometimes described the Himyarites of South Arabia as &quot;Cushaeans&quot; and &quot;Ethiopians&quot;.

Gregory of Tours claimed that Cush was the same person as the Persian Zoroaster and that he was the inventor of magic and idolatry.

The Persian historian al-Tabari (c. 915) recounts a tradition that the wife of Cush was named Qarnabil, daughter of Batawil, son of Tiras, and that she bore him the &quot;Abyssinians, Sindis and Indians&quot;.

Explorer James Bruce, who visited the Ethiopian Highlands c. 1770, wrote of &quot;a tradition among the Abyssinians, which they say they have had since time immemorial&quot;, that in the days after the Deluge, Cush, the son of Ham, traveled with his family up the Nile until they reached the Atbara plain, then still uninhabited, from where they could see the Ethiopian table-land. There they ascended and built Axum, and sometime later returned to the lowland, building Meroë. He also states that European scholars of his own day had summarily rejected this account on grounds of their established theory, that Cush must have arrived in Africa via Arabia and the Bab-el-Mandeb, a strait located between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula, and Djibouti and Eritrea on the Horn of Africa. Further, the great obelisk of Axum was said to have been erected by Cush in order to mark his allotted territory, and his son Ityopp&#x27;is was said to have been buried there, according to the &quot;Book of Aksum&quot;, which Bruce asserts was revered throughout Abyssinia equally with the &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot;.

Scholars like Johann Michaelis and Rosenmuller have pointed out that the name &quot;Cush&quot; was applied to tracts of country on both sides of the Red Sea, in the Arabian Peninsula (Yemen) and Northeast Africa.

Professor Francis Brown suggested that the Cushites referred to both African and Asiatic peoples, with the latter being identified as the Kassites. Brown believes that the Cushites in the Book of Genesis, such as Nimrod, were Asiatics based on contextual information. The Asiatic theory has been supported by archaeologists such as Juris Zarins.

<text>USS &quot;O-1&quot; (SS-62) was the lead ship of her class of submarines built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==
The O-class submarines were designed to meet a Navy requirement for coastal defense boats. The submarines had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced on the surface and submerged. The O-class submarines had a crew of 29 officers and enlisted men. They had a diving depth of .

For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the O class had a range of at .

The boats were armed with four 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes in the bow. They carried four reloads, for a total of eight torpedoes. The O-class submarines were also armed with a single 3&quot;/50 caliber deck gun.

==Construction and career==

&quot;O-1&quot; was laid down on 26 March 1917 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 9 July 1918, and commissioned on 5 November 1918 with Lieutenant Commander Norman L. Kirk in command. Commissioned just before the Armistice with Germany, &quot;O-1&quot; operated in the Atlantic coastal waters from Cape Cod to Key West, Florida, after World War I. Reclassified a second-line submarine on 25 July 1924, and first-line on 6 June 1928, &quot;O-1&quot; was converted to an experimental vessel on 28 December 1930, and operated in this capacity out of the submarine base at New London, Connecticut, until decommissioning on 11 June 1931. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 18 May 1938 and sold for scrap.

<doc id="417173" wikidata="Q5237182" url="?curid=417173" title="USS Greenling (SSN-614)">
<text>USS &quot;Greenling&quot; (SSN-614) was a . She was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the greenling, an elongated, fine-scaled fish found from Kamchatka to California. Her keel was laid down on 15 August 1961 by General Dynamics Electric Boat of Groton, Connecticut.

On 10 April 1963, &quot;Thresher&quot;, the lead ship of &quot;Greenling&quot;&#x27;s class, was lost due to severe design flaws in her non-nuclear piping systems. Because she was still early in the construction process, &quot;Greenling&quot; was one of three selected &quot;Thresher&quot;-class submarines selected for conversion to the &quot;improved &quot;Thresher&quot; class.&quot; (The other two were SSN-613 &quot;Flasher&quot; and SSN-615 &quot;Gato&quot;.) She was launched on 4 April 1964 sponsored by Mrs. H.C. Bruton. On 29 April, she was towed to Quincy, Massachusetts, for lengthening and submarine safety program (SUBSAFE) modifications. Modifications included increased buoyancy and adding 13 feet 9 inches of length to the hull, providing improved living and working conditions for the crew and space for additional equipment. Before construction of &quot;Greenling&quot; was completed, she and her sister ships were redesignated the &quot;Permit&quot; class, after the eldest surviving member of the class. &quot;Greenling&quot; was commissioned on 3 November 1967.

==Service history==
On 27 May 1968, &quot;Greenling&quot;″s fleet training exercise was interrupted by the search and rescue operation for missing submarine . Her commanding officer was designated the Commander of the SAR Task Element, which included of three nuclear and four diesel submarines. That assignment continued until 12 June 1968.

&quot;Greenling&quot; spent most of her career assigned to Submarine Squadron 10 (SUBRON 10) and was homeported in Groton, Connecticut.

On 27 March 1973, &quot;Greenling&quot; accidentally dived &quot;well below its test depth&quot; during a training dive off the coast of Bermuda due to a faulty depth gauge. A different gauge revealed the error and the submarine returned to the surface safely. Various reports placed &quot;Greenling&quot; between 150 and 200 feet from crush depth at her deepest point. After returning to port, she was sent to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine for examination, and was returned to service soon after.

In the spring of 1983, &quot;Greenling&quot; was participating in a &quot;Tactical Readiness Exam (TRE)&quot; in the Caribbean, when, during a drill to evade an enemy surface ship, a full down-angle with a flank bell was ordered. The flank bell necessitates the reactor&#x27;s main coolant pumps switching from slow to fast speed. However, the slow-speed windings did not open before the fast-speed windings, resulting in a fireball that went through the entire vital switchgear in auxiliary machinery space upper level. All propulsion was lost, which is necessary to &quot;drive&quot; the boat back to the surface. A normal ballast tank blow had no effect, while a subsequent emergency blow of the ballast tanks slowly stopped the descent and ultimately brought the boat and crew to the surface. In rough seas, the crew back aft in engineering were unable to utilize the aft escape hatch to bring fresh air and cooling into the spaces. The engineering crew ultimately spent approximately 6 hours back aft with no AC, before finally making it forward, taking turns on the superstructure planes to cool off. The &quot;Greenling&quot; and crew spent approximately 2 weeks in Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico making repairs to allow the boat to make it back to New London on the surface. The event has been lovingly referred to as &quot;The BBQ of 83&quot;.

&quot;Greenling&quot; was decommissioned on 18 April 1994 and was subsequently disposed through the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 30 September 1994. Equipment from &quot;Greenling&quot;″s control room was salvaged and used to construct a simulation of a submarine control room as an exhibit at the Naval Undersea Museum in Keyport, Washington.

<text>Dewey is the first cloned deer and was born on May 23, 2003. Specifically, he is a White-tailed Deer, or &quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;, and was cloned from a dead buck by the Texas A&amp;M University College of Veterinary Medicine. At last report, Dewey was living a peaceful, uneventful life in College Station, TX.

Dewey was born on May 23, 2003. A DNA analysis proved that he was genetically identical to the donor, a buck that scored a 232 on the Boone and Crockett scale. He was cloned from tissue harvested from the skin cells of the hunted deer. Researchers at Texas A&amp;M are studying his antler growth as well as following his offspring to measure their antler growth.

<text>Ashur ( &quot;ʾAššūr&quot;) was the second son of Shem, the son of Noah. Ashur&#x27;s brothers were Elam, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.

Prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, there was contention in academic circles regarding whether Ashur or Nimrod built the Assyrian cities of Nineveh, Resen, Rehoboth-Ir and Calah, since the name &quot;Ashur&quot; can refer to both the person and the country (compare AV and ESV). Sir Walter Raleigh devoted several pages in his &quot;History of the World&quot; () to reciting past scholarship regarding the question of whether it had been Nimrod or Ashur who built the cities in Assyria. Both the JPS Tanakh 1917 and the 1611 King James Bible clarify the language of the Septuagint and Vulgate translations of Genesis 10:11-12, by explicitly crediting Ashur as the founder of the cities of Nineveh, Rehoboth, Calah, and Resen.

The Ge&#x27;ez version of the Book of Jubilees, affirmed by the 15 Jubilees scrolls found amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls, affirms that the contested lands in Genesis 10:8–12 were apportioned to Ashur. Jubilees 9:3 states, &quot;And for Ashur came forth the second Portion, all the land of Ashur and Nineveh and Shinar and to the border of India, and it ascends and skirts the river.&quot; The 1st century Judaeo-Roman historian Flavius Josephus also gives the following statement: &quot;Ashur lived at the city of Nineveh; and named his subjects Assyrians, who became the most fortunate nation, beyond others&quot; (Antiquities, i, vi, 4).

Ashur had three sons called Phares, Mirus and Mokil.

<text>Hoensbroek () is a Dutch town in the municipality of Heerlen. It is situated in the southeast of Limburg, a province in the southeast of the Netherlands. Until 1982, Hoensbroek was a separate municipality.

Hoensbroek is known for its medieval castle, Kasteel Hoensbroek, named after Knight Hoen, a member of the Hoen Family. It dates from around 1250.

Hoensbroek is also known for the fair on Ascension Day (Hemelvaartsdag). The fair brings as many as 100,000 people to the town, every year.

In medieval times, the town was known under the name of Gebrook, meaning as much as &quot;Swampy Landscape&quot;, and belonged to the Family Hoen. Their family name eventually mingled with the original one, resulting in the name &quot;Hoensbroeck&quot; for the location and Van Hoensbroeck as the family name. The spoken dialect, Gerbrooker Plat, refers to the ancient name of Gebrook.

==Recent history==
Coal mining
The town remained modest until the early 20th century, when several mines were opened (including the Emma), caused a substantial increase in population. This necessitated the construction of new residential areas, with the result that Heerlen &amp; Hoensbroek grew closer to each other.

Today
Hoensbroek &amp; Heerlen now form a contiguous and built-up area. Only the tip, the former Oranje Nassau III mine, currently designed as a park, represents a kind of barrier between the towns. The mines in the area are now all closed, but many of the workers before landscaped areas still exist.

==Transport==
Railway station: Hoensbroek. The town can also be reached from Heerlen railway station and Sittard railway station.

Bus: The town can be reached by bus, in this city there are public buses from Veolia Transport(Limburg)

<doc id="417192" wikidata="Q16240937" url="?curid=417192" title="Caguax">
<text>Caguax was a Taíno cacique who lived on the island of Borinquén (the Taíno name for Puerto Rico) before and during the Spanish colonization of the Americas. The name of his yucayeque, or Taino village, was Turabo; it comprised the Caguas Valley and surrounding mountains. This area today comprises the modern municipalities of Caguas, Aguas Buenas, Gurabo, and portions of San Lorenzo, Juncos and Las Piedras in east-central Puerto Rico. Guaybanex Caguax was an early convert to the Catholic faith; he adopted the Spanish name Francisco at the time of his baptism. His high rank in Taino society allowed him to also retain his Taino names, Guaybanex, and his surname, Caguax. Francisco Guaybanex Caguax sought to avoid conflict with the Spanish; as a powerful chief in the northern slopes and plains of the island he understood the heavy toll his people would suffer if they were to oppose the Spanish rule, and he sought peaceful ways to deal with the situation. As early as 1508, Caguax cooperated with the colonists’ requests for labor and a food supply. In 1511, he was one of only two chiefs who accepted the peace terms that the Spanish had offered a few months after the Taino Revolt started. In 1512, he was taken captive and transported to Hacienda del Toa. There he was humiliated before his nitainos by being forced to become the governor&#x27;s personal servant. Caguax died in captivity in 1518 or early 1519. He was succeeded by his daughter, Maria Bagaaname. 
Late in 1508 Juan Ponce de León, commissioned by Nicolás de Ovando to colonize the island of San Juan Bautista, arrived in the territory of cacique Agüeybaná I in southwest Puerto Rico. There, both leaders performed the Guaytiao ceremony, in which they exchanged names as a promise not to hurt each other. This sort of peace treaty allowed Ponce de León to settle the island and to receive cooperation from Agüeybaná I&#x27;s cacique allies in order to grow the yuca that was needed to feed the Spanish settlers.

Caguax was among those allies of the Spanish who were willing to use their authority to organize their nitainos (or &quot;captains&quot;, as the Spanish called them), to direct the labor of naborias under them for these purposes. Products such as yuca and peppers were grown in Caguax&#x27;s domain for colonists Francisco Robledo and Juan de Castellanos. In 1510, this production had a value of 255 gold pesos. Robledo and Castellanos not only had rights over the food production process but also over the Taino, the indigenous people, who provided the labor in the fields, and were known in the Taino language as &quot;conucos&quot;. When gold was discovered in the Turabo River, this same Taino power structure was also used to force the Taino people to work in the mines and rivers in search of gold. 

By 1511, the growing tensions between the Spanish and the Taino exploded in revolts around the island that lasted into 1518. After Ponce de León won the first battles early in 1511, peace was offered to the island caciques. Only two accepted: Caguax and Otoao. During this time of great distress, Ponce de León was replaced as island governor by Juan Cerón, and Nicolás de Ovando was replaced in Santo Domingo by Diego Colón. Up until this time, Caguax, his family, nitainos and naborias, had lived in their own yucayeque in the Caguas Valley near the Caguitas River. Archaeologist Carlos A. Pérez Merced, excavating in the area, found ceramic and pottery from three different indigenous periods: Igneri, pre-Taino and Taino. This indicates the existence of an ancient indigenous settlement at the site. 

Early in 1512, Cerón redistributed Ponce de León&#x27;s caciques among his friends and banished Caguax, along with his relatives and entourage, to Hacienda del Toa in the northern coastal plain, west of Caparra, the first Spanish settlement on the island. His mother, siblings, wives and children have been identified by records that were sent to la Real Hacienda to account for the distribution of clothes and other goods, called the &quot;cacona&quot;, which were given to the indigenous people in captivity once a year between 1513 and 1519. Historians Raquel Rosario Rivera and Jalil Sued Badillo, among others, have concluded that Cacica Yayo was Caguax’s mother, which means that she was the ranking cacica whose descendants would inherit the rank of Turabo chiefs. Her daughter Catalina, Caguax&#x27;s sister, should have borne the next cacique or cacica to reign after Caguax, but at the time of her death in captivity she had no living heirs; the same was true of her sister Maria. Their brother, Juan Comerio, could not inherit the rank of chief as he was not in the line of succession. Cacica Catalina died soon after being taken to el Toa. Caguax died later, sometime between late 1518 and early 1519. With no living heirs in the line of succession, María Bagaaname, Caguax&#x27;s eldest daughter, was ceded the right to bear the successor. Caguax had two other children, Comerio and Isabel. He also had two wives, María and Leonor, and it is unclear which of his three children were borne by which of them. Around 1524, Maria Bagaaname married Diego Muriel, an overseer in Hacienda del Toa&#x27;s. This marriage was approved by the authorities, and the couple bore descendants. As for the nitainos who had been forced to move with Caguax to oversee the work in Hacienda del Toa, records show that Aguayayex, Guayex, Caguas, Juanico Comerio, Juan Acayaguana, Diego Barrionuevo, Esteban directed agricultural tasks and that Pedro was in charge of the mines. They oversaw 230 naborias from Caguax&#x27;s yukayeque who had been taken there to work in the conucos and the mines. Cerón forced Caguax to be his personal servant, as his nitainos and naborias were forced to work the conucos and gold mines. 

The city and municipality of Caguas, Puerto Rico derives its name from him, and a neighborhood there is named after him.

<text>B-427 was a Project 641 () diesel-electric attack submarine of the Soviet Navy. The &quot;B&quot; (actually &quot;Б&quot;) in her designation stands for большая (&quot;bolshaya&quot;, &quot;large&quot;). Commissioned in 1971, the submarine operated with the Russian Pacific Fleet until decommissioning in 1994.

The boat was sold to a group of Australian businessmen, who converted her into a museum vessel, which was placed on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum (under the name Foxtrot-540) from 1995 until 1998, then at Long Beach, California (under the name Podvodnaya Lodka B-427 &quot;Scorpion&quot;) in 1998.

The submarine fell into disrepair, and has been closed to the public since 2015.

==Decommissioning and preservation==
The submarine was decommissioned by the Russian Navy in December 1994. She was one of the last three Foxtrot-class submarines to serve in the Russian Pacific Fleet. The boat was acquired by a group of Australian businessmen on a three-year lease purchase contract, and was towed from Vladivostok on 25 July 1995. En route to Sydney, the tow company claimed that the deal for the Russian Navy to cover the cost of the tow was invalid, and claimed that A$150,000 in towing expenses was required. The submarine arrived in Sydney on 31 August, and after some modifications, was loaned to the Australian National Maritime Museum for display as a museum vessel under the designation &quot;Foxtrot-540&quot; (the submarine&#x27;s last pennant number while in service). As the submarine was still the property of the Russian Navy for the duration of the lease, an Australian ex-submariner was commissioned into the Russian Navy to command and look after Foxtrot-540, with the boat&#x27;s former engineering officer assisting. The submarine was in near-operational condition; the diesel generators and electrical storage system, ballast tanks, and hotel load equipment were functional, and Russian personnel travelled to Australia to teach museum staff about maintenance and operation of the boat. Foxtrot-540 spent three years berthed at the museum, attracting over 700,000 visitors during this period (including intelligence analysts from multiple nations during the first weeks on display).

In May 1998, the submarine was loaded onto a heavy lift ship and relocated to Long Beach, California. On arrival, she was berthed next to , and opened to the public on 14 July under the designation &quot;Podvodnaya Lodka B-427 &quot;Scorpion&quot;&quot;. On 19 April 2011, the company operating &quot;Queen Mary&quot; (Delaware North) announced that they had acquired &quot;Scorpion&quot;, and were planning to increase attendance at both attractions through combined ticketing and joint marketing campaigns. Urban Commons took over the lease of the Queen Mary and the Scorpion in April 2016. The Scorpion Submarine is owned by NEWCO Pty Ltd and is on a long-term lease to Urban Commons.

==Museum closure==
In November 2012, the vessel was discovered to have flooding and as a result was listing 24 degrees to the starboard side. It was closed to the public in 2015, by which time the pressure hull had ruptured and raccoons had taken up residence on board. By 2021, when control of the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; returned to Long Beach, the city was attempting to have the submarine removed.

<doc id="417201" wikidata="Q928863" url="?curid=417201" title="Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814">
<text>Janet Jackson&#x27;s Rhythm Nation 1814 (also simply known as Rhythm Nation 1814orRhythm Nation) is the fourth studio album by American singer Janet Jackson, released on September 19, 1989, by A&amp;M Records. Although label executives wanted material similar to her previous album, &quot;Control&quot; (1986), Jackson insisted on creating a concept album addressing social issues. Collaborating with songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, she drew inspiration from various tragedies reported through news media, exploring racism, poverty, and substance abuse, in addition to themes of romance. Although its primary concept of a sociopolitical utopia was met with mixed reactions, its composition received critical acclaim. Jackson came to be considered a role model for youth because of her socially conscious lyrics.

As with &quot;Control&quot;, recording for &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; took place at Lewis and Jam&#x27;s Flyte Tyme Studios in Minneapolis, Minnesota where they worked in seclusion with Jackson to complete the album. Noted for its use of sampling and utilizing heavily swung synthesized percussion throughout its production, the record encompasses a variety of musical styles, such as new jack swing, hard rock, pop, dance and industrial music. Songs range from mechanized dance rhythms to soft balladry, giving it appeal across multiple radio formats. It is the only album in the history of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart to have seven commercial singles peak within the top five positions. It is also the first album to produce number one hits on the chart in three separate calendar years, beginning with &quot;Miss You Much&quot; in 1989, &quot;Escapade&quot; and &quot;Black Cat&quot; in 1990, and culminating with &quot;Love Will Never Do (Without You)&quot; in 1991.

&quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; became Jackson&#x27;s second consecutive album to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified 6× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It became the best-selling album of 1990 in the United States and has sold an estimated 12 million copies worldwide. Due to its innovative production and lyrical exploration, critics have come to regard it as the pinnacle of Jackson&#x27;s artistic achievement. Music scholars note the record garnered her a level of cross-cultural appeal unmatched by industry peers. Considered a &quot;landmark&quot; album, it has also been cited as an influence in the works of numerous music artists, setting stylistic trends in the years following its release.

Visuals in music videos and live performances further elevated Jackson&#x27;s superstardom. The 30-minute &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; film, a film depicting two aspiring musicians whose lives are disrupted by substance abuse, aired on MTV to promote the album. Jackson&#x27;s Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 became the most successful debut concert tour by a recording artist at the time. She was regarded as a fashion icon, with various attire from the album&#x27;s promotional tour and music videos being emulated by youth. Jackson received nine Grammy Award nominations, becoming the first woman to be nominated for Producer of the Year and winning Best Long Form Music Video for &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot;. Jackson received the MTV Video Vanguard Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her significant contributions to popular culture. Her handwritten lyrics to the album&#x27;s title track &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; as well as her militaristic uniform for its music video have been preserved by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2021, the Library of Congress announced it selected the album for preservation in the National Recording Registry as part of the class of 2020, deeming it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

== Background ==
Following the critical and commercial breakthrough of her third studio album &quot;Control&quot; (1986), Jackson was motivated to take a larger role in her album&#x27;s creative process. According to &quot;Billboard&#x27;s Hottest Hot 100 Hits&quot; (2002), A&amp;M Records requested she record an album similar to &quot;Control&quot;. It was rumored that label executives suggested a concept album titled &quot;Scandal&quot;, which would have centered on her personal and family life. However, Jam later denied the claim that &quot;Scandal&quot; was ever suggested, although he confirmed there was encouragement to produce a &quot;Control II&quot;. Jackson opposed the idea of a direct sequel to &quot;Control&quot;, stating &quot;that&#x27;s what I didn&#x27;t want to do. I wanted to do something that I really believed in and that I really felt strong about.&quot; She was initially criticized for choosing to dedicate the album&#x27;s theme to social consciousness, but remained committed. Jam stated that her inspiration came primarily from watching CNN and other news sources. In particular, her reaction to the Stockton playground murders led to recording &quot;Livin&#x27; in a World (They Didn&#x27;t Make)&quot;, &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; and &quot;State of the World&quot;.

While discussing the origin of the title &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot;, Jackson stated she first uttered the phrase during a conversation with her producers. &quot;I thought it would be great if we could create our own nation&quot; adding that it would be &quot;one that would have a positive message and that everyone would be free to join.&quot; She based the idea on the prevalence of various youth groups and organizations that are formed as a means of creating a common identity. The usage of the number &quot;1814&quot; represents the year the national anthem &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; was written. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; emphasized the core concept is further explored in the album&#x27;s opening pledge (the first track of the recording), which states: &quot;We are a nation with no geographic boundaries, bound together through our beliefs. We are like-minded individuals, sharing a common vision, pushing toward a world rid of color-lines.&quot; Several critics noted that &quot;R&quot; (Rhythm) and &quot;N&quot; (Nation) are the eighteenth and fourteenth letters of the alphabet, though Jackson said this was coincidental.

Jackson&#x27;s primary goal for the record was to reach a younger audience who may have been unaware of what it means to be socially conscious individuals. She expressed: &quot;I wanted to capture their attention through my music.&quot; She was influenced by other musical acts such as Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Tracy Chapman, and U2, although she felt their music appealed primarily to adults who were already invested in social change. She also stated, &quot;I&#x27;m not naive—I know an album or a song can&#x27;t change the world. I just want my music and my dance to catch the audience&#x27;s attention&quot; hoping it would motivate people to &quot;make some sort of difference&quot;.

== Composition and production ==
&quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; was recorded over a period of seven months. Its production took place at Flyte Tyme studios in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with majority of the album being recorded in the winter of 1988. According to Jam, he, Lewis and Jackson chose to isolate themselves to compose the record. No one from A&amp;M Records was invited to the studio to observe and label executives complied with their request. The trio co-authored six of the album&#x27;s songs: &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot;, &quot;State of the World&quot;, &quot;Alright&quot;, &quot;Escapade&quot;, &quot;Come Back to Me&quot; and &quot;Someday Is Tonight&quot;. Five of the six remaining songs for the record, &quot;The Knowledge&quot;, &quot;Miss You Much&quot;, &quot;Love Will Never Do (Without You)&quot;, &quot;Livin&#x27; in a World (They Didn&#x27;t Make)&quot; and &quot;Lonely&quot; were penned by Jam and Lewis, while &quot;Black Cat&quot; was written solely by Jackson. She co-produced the album with Jam and Lewis, while John McClain served as executive producer; the song &quot;Black Cat&quot; was produced by Jellybean Johnson.

The LP was produced primarily through use of synthesizers and drum machines. Prior its recording, Jam and Lewis had begun to update their equipment for Flyte Tyme studios, experimenting with different types of drum machines and keyboards. While &quot;Control&quot; had been recorded primarily using the LinnDrum machine, songs for &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; were mostly recorded using the E-mu SP-1200, which was more commonplace for hip hop music at the time. The Oberheim OB-8 analog synthesizer, as well as those made by Sequential Circuits, were also used for mixing and recording. The only equipment utilized for the recording of &quot;Control&quot; that was also used for producing &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; was the Ensoniq Mirage keyboard. The instrumental tracks for &quot;Miss You Much&quot;, &quot;Love Will Never Do (Without You)&quot; and &quot;Escapade&quot; were among the first to be recorded, considered to be follow-ups to the &quot;beat-heavy, catchy songs&quot; that Jackson, Jam and Lewis crafted on &quot;Control&quot; which &quot;defined the punch and power of 1980s dance and pop music.&quot;

Jam noted it was commonplace for Jackson to sing her vocals with the base track first and then have the rest of the song built around it in order to make her voice the center of the piece. &quot;Janet did all of her background vocals and not just the lead vocals. The idea with her has always been that she does all of her own vocals, so that it&#x27;s totally a Janet record.&quot; On the title track &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot;, her vocals range from B3 to A5, climaxing within its middle eight. Musicologist Richard J. Ripani observed the album and title track showcased the variety of contemporary R&amp;B styles, making &quot;use of elements across the R&amp;B spectrum, including use of a sample loop (&quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; samples &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot; by Sly and the Family Stone), triplet swing, rapped vocal parts and blues notes (D naturals and G naturals).&quot; This style of music, known as new jack swing, was immensely popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Though officially credited to the production techniques of Teddy Riley, Ripani theorized Riley was influenced by Jackson&#x27;s 1986 single &quot;Nasty&quot;, which also features a distinctive triplet swing. Jon Pareles observed the album&#x27;s diversity catered to a wide variety of radio formats, including pop, quiet storm, Adult contemporary and mainstream rock. &quot;Black Cat&quot; was a stand-out for the record, not only for being composed exclusively by Jackson, but for its stark departure from her general style of music, delving into hard rock. While Jellybean Johnson was elected to produce it, Dave Berry was recruited to play guitar for the song. It was recorded using a mixture of Rockman and Marshall amplifier to give the song a heavy metal sound.

The sequencing of the record&#x27;s track list was done strategically, starting with songs that lyrically depict societal injustices and ending with those that explore love, relationships and sexuality. This decision also factored into the album&#x27;s artwork and marketing, giving it an overt black and white militant imagery. Jam explained that &quot;[t]he idea of putting &#x27;Rhythm Nation&#x27;, &#x27;State of the World&#x27; and &#x27;The Knowledge&#x27; as the first three songs on the record really set the tone as to what the record was. Then to have the segue after that where she says, &#x27;Get the point? Good. Let&#x27;s dance ...&#x27; and then go into &#x27;Miss You Much&#x27;, that was purposely done.&quot; He also stated that the safer marketing strategy for the project would have been &quot;a beautiful colored picture of Janet on the cover&quot; with &quot;Escapade&quot; as its title, starting the track listing with &quot;Miss You Much&quot;, &quot;Love Will Never Do (Without You)&quot; and &quot;Escapade&quot;, and ending it with &quot;Livin&#x27; in a World (They Didn&#x27;t Make)&quot;, &quot;The Knowledge&quot; and &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; but noted that despite being the same collection of songs, the alternate sequencing and imagery would not have had the same impact. Of its lyrical themes, Kate Kelly stated the album &quot;reveals a social conscience speaking of getting an education, avoiding drugs, and feeding the homeless. All this might seem a little heavy for dance music or pop radio, but Jackson fuses her concepts with driving dance energy that hits the hearts of those hitting the dance-floor.&quot; Andrew Barker of &quot;Variety&quot; described it as &quot;a quasi-concept album whose opening three songs directly addressed crime, the crack epidemic, racism, homelessness and youth illiteracy — not exactly a recipe for a party. And yet the record was somehow even more successful than &quot;Control&quot;, generating a then-record seven top-five singles.&quot;

== Promotion and videography ==
Upon the release of the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Miss You Much&quot;, A&amp;M Records issued a press release for the record, announcing social themes to &quot;run throughout much of the material&quot;. Jackson performed &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; on several television shows internationally, including &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and a &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot;. She also performed a controversial rendition of &quot;Black Cat&quot; at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards in which she tore open her snapped blouse; although this was routine for performances of the song in concert, it was considered to have &quot;ushered in a new age of sexual spontaneity&quot; for the singer and viewed as the first &quot;shocking&quot; performance of her career.

A thirty-minute short film, &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot;, was produced as a visual companion for the album. Referred to as a &quot;telemusical&quot;, the storyline incorporates three separate music videos: &quot;Miss You Much&quot;, &quot;The Knowledge&quot;, and &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot;. Jackson and director Dominic Sena developed the screenplay, which centers around two boys whose dreams of pursuing music careers are destroyed through substance abuse and drug trafficking. Sena referred to the film as the &quot;1814 Project&quot;, attempting to keep the public unaware that Jackson was filming on the streets of Los Angeles. The project had a budget of $1.6 million, and was aired on MTV prior to the album&#x27;s release. A&amp;M co-founder Jerry Moss stated that the decision to film the composite videos all at once for &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; regardless of budget was &quot;a brilliant way to go&quot; allotting Jackson more time to focus her attention elsewhere.

&quot;Parallel Lines: Media Representations of Dance&quot; (1993) observed that in &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot;, Jackson represents a &quot;modern good fairy&quot; attempting to guide troubled youth to a more positive way of life. Each of the three segments serve a different purpose, beginning with affinity and companionship in &quot;Miss You Much&quot;, followed by anger and frustration in her rooftop solo and ending with &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot;, in which Jackson and her dancers &quot;have become a uniformed, formidable army, whose controlled energetic moves and shouts project a disciplined resolution to inspire others through dance and music.&quot; Their group dynamic visually depicts a gender neutral equality, with Jackson &quot;performing asexually and anonymously in front of, but as one of the members of the group.&quot; It is also noted that the success of the film is not only the final product, but in the commercial and social implications of its development. In selecting an unknown street dancer, Anthony Thomas, to develop her choreography, &quot;Janet Jackson secures a threefold achievement: she satisfies the dictates of the commercial pop music industry by creating a dance image which is significantly different from her earlier work; she demonstrates that, despite fame, she is still in touch with contemporary youth pop culture and its fashions; and finally, she [utilizes], not the dance traditions of Hollywood musical ... but the work of a young black man whose training is outside the institutions of Western theatre and clearly an Afro-American cultural expression of the late 1980s.&quot; The film received positive reception. Jefferson Graham in &quot;USA Today&quot; commented that &quot;she dances up a storm in the moody black-and-white video&#x27;s three songs ... and plays the role of a mystical figure to young kids.&quot; Jon Pareles remarked that &quot;[it] juxtaposes her dance routines with grim urban imagery and a plot line about drugs versus dreams.&quot; It was also released on VHS and LaserDisc. Jackson received two MTV Music Video Award nominations for &quot;Best Dance Video&quot; and &quot;Best Choreography&quot; for &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards, winning the latter.

Five other music videos were produced to promote the album&#x27;s singles. While the video for &quot;Black Cat&quot; was taken from live footage of Jackson&#x27;s concerts, those for &quot;Escapade&quot; and &quot;Alright&quot; utilized a Broadway-influenced production. The video for &quot;Alright&quot; was an homage to choreographer Michael Kidd, who was asked to participate in the project and also featured appearances by the flash dancing Nicholas Brothers, actress Cyd Charisse and bandleader Cab Calloway. An extended version of the video also features rapper Heavy D. The somber video for &quot;Come Back To Me&quot; was filmed near the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. Similarly, &quot;Love Will Never Do (Without You)&quot; was a notable departure from the typically elaborate choreography associated with Jackson&#x27;s other videos, focusing on her as an individual rather than as a part of a dancing troupe. Featuring appearances by Antonio Sabàto Jr. and Djimon Hounsou, the sandy beach setting exemplifies director Herb Ritts &quot;signature style through use of graceful movements, bold contrasts, and wide-open spaces.&quot; The music video is also regarded as the origin of what would later become Jackson&#x27;s sexually overt persona, freely displaying her legs, torso and cleavage, as well as touching her own bare skin and Sabàto Jr.&#x27;s in a sensual manner. In &quot;Present Tense: Rock &amp; Roll and Culture&quot; (1992), Anthony DeCurtis states that &quot;[t]he video celebrates hedonism and voyeurism; there are languorous displays of Jackson&#x27;s body in ripped jeans and brief top, and of several muscular male bodies, black and white, with bare arms, and chests.&quot; She received the MTV Video Vanguard Award in 1990, regarded as MTV&#x27;s highest honor for artists whose videography has significantly impacted pop culture.

A video compilation, titled &quot;The Rhythm Nation Compilation&quot;, was released on VHS and LaserDisc on November 29, 1990, and has been certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 200,000 units. Excluding &quot;State of the World&quot;, it includes the music videos for all the album&#x27;s singles, including the extended cut for &quot;Alright&quot;, as well as a prologue and epilogue.

== Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 ==
The Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 was Jackson&#x27;s debut concert tour. Described as &quot;an elaborately choreographed spectacle&quot;, it aimed to recreate the award-winning, innovative music videos of &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; and those of its predecessor, &quot;Control&quot;. Anthony Thomas served as the tour&#x27;s main choreographer, while Chuckii Booker became its musical director and opening act. She was assisted by a team of eleven musicians, five back-up singers, and six dancers. Jackson&#x27;s total production and staging reportedly cost $2 million. In addition to Jackson&#x27;s choreography, the tour was reported to portray &quot;dazzling lighting effects and pyrotechnics&quot;, as well as illusionary magic, in which Jackson was transformed into a leopard on stage.

Writing for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Jay Cocks observed the show to integrate &quot;sleek high tech and smooth dance rhythm into an evening of snazzy soul with a social conscience.&quot; Chris Willman of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; remarked that Jackson&#x27;s choreography &quot;represents the pinnacle of what can be done in the popping &#x27;n&#x27; locking style—a rapid-fire mixture of rigidly jerky and gracefully fluid movements.&quot; Several critics noted Jackson lip synced portions of the show, in a similar fashion to her contemporaries. Jon Pareles commented, &quot;most lip-synched shows are done by video-era pop performers whose audiences are young and television trained. They fill arenas to enjoy a spectacle like what they saw on television—the dancing ... the stage effects and incidentally the songs.&quot; Michael MacCambridge considered it a &quot;moot point&quot; stating, &quot;Jackson was frequently singing along with her own pre-recorded vocals, to achieve a sound closer to radio versions of singles.&quot;

The tour became the most successful debut concert tour in history, with an attendance of over two million. It also set a record for the fastest sell-out of Japan&#x27;s Tokyo Dome, selling out within seven minutes. Jackson became the only female artist other than Madonna to fill arenas at the time. It was ranked the fifth most successful tour of 1990, making her the only female artist to place within the top ten. It also solidified her reputation as a fashion icon, as fans imitated her &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; outfit and regalia. &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine reported &quot;hoards of teen girls were imitating her distinctive look—black quasi-military long jackets, black tight-tight pants, and big white shirts.&quot; Joel Selvin of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote &quot;the 23-year-old has been making smash hit records for four years, becoming a fixture on MTV and a major role model to teenage girls across the country.&quot; Over $450,000.00 in proceeds from the tour&#x27;s Madison Square Garden show were used to establish the Rhythm Nation scholarship program. The annual scholarship awards $5,000.00 to students majoring in performing arts and communications at United Negro College Fund member colleges and universities. William Allen, then-executive vice president of the UNCF, remarked: &quot;Jackson is a role model for all young people to emulate and the message she has gotten to the young people of this country through the lyrics of &#x27;Rhythm Nation 1814&#x27; is having positive effects.&quot;

== Singles ==

&quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; produced a record-setting seven top five hit singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. With lead single &quot;Miss You Much&quot;, along with &quot;Escapade&quot;, &quot;Black Cat&quot; and the album&#x27;s final single &quot;Love Will Never Do (Without You)&quot;, it also yielded four number one hits. &quot;Miss You Much&quot; topped the chart for four weeks. It also topped the Hot Dance Club Songs and Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. The single was certified platinum by the RIAA. It also reached number two in Canada and New Zealand, one in Japanese airplay and South Africa, twelve in Australia, the top fifteen in Belgium and the Netherlands, the top twenty in Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland, and twenty-two on the United Kingdom singles chart, as well as charting in Brazil. According to &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;, &quot;Miss You Much&quot; was the biggest airplay hit of the year. It sold over four million copies worldwide, and became the year&#x27;s second-best selling single behind Phil Collins&#x27;s &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot;.

&quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; peaked at number two, behind &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot;. It peaked atop Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Dance Club Songs. The single was certified gold by the RIAA. It reached number six in Canada, two in Japanese airplay and South Africa, eleven in the Netherlands, fifteen in Belgium, the top twenty of New Zealand and Sweden, and the top twenty-five of Switzerland, Poland, and the United Kingdom. &quot;Escapade&quot; topped the Hot 100, as well as the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Dance Club Songs. It was certified gold in May 1990. It reached number one in Canada and Japanese airplay, four in South Africa, ten in Sweden and Belgium, thirteen in the Netherlands, seventeen in the United Kingdom, and twenty-three in Germany. The single version of &quot;Alright&quot; featuring additional vocals from rapper Heavy D peaked at number four on the Hot 100 and Hot Dance Club Songs, while reaching number two on Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. It was certified gold in June 1990. It reached number six in Canada, three in South Africa, and one in Japanese airplay. &quot;Come Back to Me&quot; peaked at number two on the Hot 100. It reached number three in Canada, as well as number one in Japanese airplay and South Africa, and the top twenty in Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

&quot;Black Cat&quot; topped the Hot 100 and received gold certification. It reached number four in Canada and three in Japanese airplay, five in Norway, six in Australia, the top ten in Sweden, France, and Switzerland, the top fifteen in the United Kingdom, the top twenty in Belgium, and twenty-one in the Netherlands. &quot;Love Will Never Do (Without You)&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s seventh and final commercial single. It reached number one on January 19, 1991, topping the chart for one week. It reached number one in Canada and Japanese airplay, and two in South Africa. The single was certified gold by the RIAA. Lastly, &quot;State of the World&quot; was issued solely for radio airplay, making it ineligible to chart. It reached number five on the Hot 100 Airplay (Radio Songs) chart. &quot;Billboard&quot; noted it likely would have been the album&#x27;s eighth top five hit if a commercial product had been distributed.

== Critical reception ==
The album received generally positive reviews, with a mixed reaction to Jackson&#x27;s social and political themes. Dennis Hunt of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;intriguing&quot; and diverse, ranging from &quot;social commentary to lusty, sensual tunes, from dance music to songs laced with jazz and Brazilian textures.&quot; Vince Aletti of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; likened Jackson&#x27;s themes to a politician, &quot;abandoning the narrow &#x27;I&#x27; for the universal &#x27;we&#x27; and inviting us to do the same.&quot; Aletti complimented Jackson&#x27;s balance of &quot;despair with optimism, anger with hope&quot;, incorporated within its theme of social progress. Andy Ellis-Widders of &quot;Keyboard&quot; considered it &quot;a powerful statement on racial integration, social accountability, and personal integrity.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Steve Morse compared its success to that of Aerosmith and Billy Joel, declaring it &quot;a dance record with a ruthlessly frank social conscience that addresses drugs, homelessness, illiteracy and teen runaways. She&#x27;s reached far beyond dance music&#x27;s fluffy image to unite even serious rockers and rappers who usually look the other way.&quot; Michael Snyder of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; considered it a worthy successor to Jackson&#x27;s previous album &quot;Control&quot;, adding &quot;a little sociopolitical substance&quot; as she &quot;bounces between the two extremes of romance and generalized, politically correct topicality.&quot;

Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jon Pareles viewed &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; as having been &quot;thoroughly calculated&quot; for massive commercial success, noting that, as with Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973) and Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; (1987), consumers might find that &quot;[b]uying the album can mean endorsing an attitude ... the album becomes a cause without a rebellion.&quot; Pareles commended its musicality and vocals, stating &quot;[t]he tone of the music is airless, sealing out imprecision and reveling in crisp, machine-generated rhythms; Ms. Jackson&#x27;s piping voice, layered upon itself in punchy unisons or lavish harmonies, never cracks or falters.&quot; Robert Christgau wrote in his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;Her voice is as unequal to her vaguely admonitory politics as it was to her declaration of sexual availability, but the music is the message.&quot;

In 1990, the album earned Grammy Award nominations for &quot;Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance&quot; and &quot;Best Rhythm &amp; Blues Song&quot; for &quot;Miss You Much&quot;, and &quot;Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist&quot; and &quot;Best Long Form Music Video&quot; for &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot;, winning the latter award at the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards. Jackson was also nominated for &quot;Producer of the Year, Non-Classical&quot;, becoming the first woman to be nominated for the award. The following year, Jackson received nominations for &quot;Best Female Rock Vocal Performance&quot; for &quot;Black Cat&quot;, in addition to &quot;Best Rhythm &amp; Blues Song&quot; and &quot;Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance, Female&quot; for &quot;Alright&quot; at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards.

Retrospective reviews continue to assess the album favorably. Eric Henderson of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; declared the album a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Henderson also praised its diversity, stating: &quot;She was more credibly feminine, more crucially masculine, more viably adult, more believably childlike. This was, of course, critical to a project in which Janet assumed the role of mouthpiece for a nationless, multicultural utopia.&quot; Though referring to Jackson&#x27;s voice as &quot;wafer-thin&quot;, Alex Henderson of AllMusic applauded Jackson&#x27;s spirit and enthusiasm, praising the album&#x27;s numerous &quot;gems&quot;. Henderson regarded it &quot;an even higher artistic plateau&quot; than her prior album, adding: &quot;For those purchasing their first Janet Jackson release, &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; would be an even wiser investment than &quot;Control&quot;—and that&#x27;s saying a lot.&quot; Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the album as a more &quot;grandiose&quot; counterpart to &quot;Control&quot;, &quot;tough, funky and driving – the second of a perfect pair.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
== Commercial performance ==
The album debuted at number twenty-eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and eighty-seven on Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, eventually reaching the number one position on both charts. It topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for four consecutive weeks, selling three million copies within the first four months of its release. It sold an additional 1.10 million through BMG Music Club. In November 1989, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album gold. It was certified double platinum by the end of the year and ultimately certified sixfold platinum by the RIAA. It emerged as the best selling album of 1990 in the territory. As of September, 2014, the album has sold over 7 million copies in the US.

Internationally, the album reached number one in Australia, where it was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and South Africa. In Canada, it entered the top five and was certified platinum. The album peaked at number four on the United Kingdom albums chart, receiving a platinum certification. It also entered the top ten of Japan and New Zealand, where it was certified double platinum and gold. It reached the top twenty-five of Sweden, as well as the top thirty in the Netherlands and Germany. It also received gold certifications in Switzerland and Hong Kong. It has sold an estimated 12 million copies worldwide. The &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; video compilation and its reissue were each certified double platinum in United States.

== Legacy ==
The commercial success of &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; was an unexpected achievement for mainstream pop music. Although Jackson was told focusing her album&#x27;s theme on social consciousness would negatively impact sales, it was &quot;a prediction soon proved wrong when the album was certified multi-platinum&quot; and subsequently topped the pop, R&amp;B and dance music charts. In &quot;She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul&quot; (2003), Lucy O&#x27;Brien wrote that contrary to A&amp;M&#x27;s fear that the album would underperform, its multi-platinum sales pushed Jackson to a level of superstardom rivaling her brother Michael, calling it a &quot;personal manifesto&quot; and regarding it as a female counterpart to Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; (1971). Timothy E. Scheurer, author of &quot;Born in the USA: The Myth of America in Popular Music from Colonial Times to the Present&quot; (2007), wrote that the album &quot;may remind some of Sly Stone prior to &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Going On&quot; and other African-American artists of the 1970s in its tacit assumption that the world imagined by Dr. King is still possible, that the American Dream is a dream for all people.&quot; It made history as the only album to generate seven top-five hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, surpassing Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; (1982) and Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; (1984), which each have seven top ten hits. It is also the first album to achieve number one hits in three separate calendar years, with &quot;Miss You Much&quot; in 1989, &quot;Escapade&quot; and &quot;Black Cat&quot; in 1990, and &quot;Love Will Never Do (Without You)&quot; in 1991. This feat would subsequently be matched by The Weeknd&#x27;s &quot;After Hours&quot; in 2021. Additionally, it is one of only ten albums—alongside Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot; (1987), &quot;Saturday Night Fever: The Original Movie Sound Track&quot; (1977), Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;Whitney&quot; (1987), George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Faith&quot; (1987), Paula Abdul&#x27;s &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot; (1989), Mariah Carey&#x27;s self-titled debut (1990), Usher&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot; (2004),
Katy Perry&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Dream&quot; (2010) and Taylor Swift&#x27;s 1989—to produce a minimum of four number ones.
Aside from its commercial performance, the album&#x27;s composition has continued to receive acclaim for its sonic innovation. Upon its 25th anniversary, music critic and scholar Joseph Vogel observed that when viewed &quot;as a complete artistic statement, &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; was a stunning achievement. It married the pleasures of pop with the street energy and edge of hip-hop.&quot; Kyle Anderson of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; asserted the record &quot;has barely aged—it sounds as rich and vital as it did when it was first released, and stylistically as contemporary as anything on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.&quot; Anderson also underscores that it pioneered several musical trends, citing records by pop and R&amp;B artists including Rihanna, Pink, Beyoncé, Frank Ocean, Gwen Stefani, The Weeknd, Lady Gaga, Jhené Aiko, Miguel, Christina Aguilera, FKA Twigs, and Tinashe that have exhibited similarities to the &quot;landmark&quot; album. Its single for &quot;Alright&quot; featuring Heavy D made Jackson the first pop artist to team with a rapper, &quot;setting the trend for future pop and hip-hop collaborations.&quot; Additionally, &quot;Black Cat&quot; set a precedent for female pop stars segueing into glam metal. The album notably influenced Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous&quot; (1991) and &quot;&quot; (1995), the latter of which features the sibling&#x27;s duet &quot;Scream&quot;, produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Its impact also extends to indie and alternative rock music, with School of Seven Bells, A Sunny Day in Glasgow, and Alexis Krauss of Sleigh Bells citing the album as an influence in their work. MTV&#x27;s Brenna Ehrlich remarked: &quot;From Beyoncé ... to Britney Spears to Robyn to Sleigh Bells, the influence of Jackson&#x27;s game-changer of a record is still rippling through the radio waves (or SoundCloud waves) today.&quot;

Jackson&#x27;s handwritten lyrics to &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; have been preserved by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;Women Who Rock&quot; exhibit, which Kathryn Metz describes as &quot;the perfect platform to talk about song structure&quot; for the museum&#x27;s &quot;Women Who Rock: Songwriting and Point of View&quot; course, in which students analyze music written by female songwriters. The Hall has also preserved her military styled &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; uniform. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; observed the song&#x27;s music video &quot;set the template for hundreds of videos to come in the Nineties and aughts.&quot; Mike Weaver remarked the &quot;innovative, one-of-a-kind, funk-and-groove choreography was unlike anything seen in the history of pop music.&quot; Although music historian Ted Gioia considered the song to be an &quot;awkward chant&quot; he commented that &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; became &quot;one of the most riveting videos of the era, a kind of sensual steampunk for MTV viewers.&quot; In 1990, Jackson received MTV&#x27;s Video Vanguard Award for her contributions to the art form. That same year, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in recognition of her impact on the recording industry and philanthropic endeavors, including her Rhythm Nation Scholarship fund. With her contractual obligations to A&amp;M fulfilled in 1991, she signed with Virgin Records for an unprecedented multimillion-dollar deal, becoming the world&#x27;s highest paid musician at the time.

Sal Cinquemani noted her popularity had eclipsed Michael Jackson&#x27;s, &quot;as she would continue to do for more than a decade&quot;. Music scholars John Shepherd and David Horn wrote that as a crossover artist on the pop and R&amp;B charts, she emerged &quot;the most dominant female performer of the 1980s&quot; behind Whitney Houston. Dan Rubey observed that she presented herself as a role model for black women and as a creative intellect whose work advocated the advancement of black people. Joseph Vogel stated that her rising popularity towards the end of the decade was important for several reasons, &quot;not the least of which was how it coincided with (and spoke to) the rise of black feminism&quot;. At a time when radio airplay and MTV primarily catered to white rock musicians, her album and its predecessor garnered widespread critical acclaim alongside other &quot;unprecedented breakthroughs&quot; by black women—including Alice Walker&#x27;s &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (1982), Toni Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Beloved&quot; (1987) and Patricia Hill Collins&#x27;s &quot;Black Feminist Thought&quot; (1990)—musically capturing the spirit of the movement and presenting an alternate model on both womanhood and feminism to that of Madonna. Regarding her diverse appeal among youth, he also stated: &quot;Janet didn&#x27;t have the vocal prowess of Whitney Houston, or the poetic subtlety of Kate Bush; she didn&#x27;t have Annie Lennox&#x27;s penchant for the avant-garde or Madonna&#x27;s predilection for shock. But none of these artists achieved the cross-racial impact (particularly on youth culture) of Janet. And none of them had an album like &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot;.&quot;

Jackson herself would comment on the album&#x27;s legacy on her 2015 album &quot;Unbreakable&quot;. In the song &quot;Shoulda Known Better&quot;, she reflects on her optimistic wish that &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; could have profoundly changed the world, noting that there are many, deeper issues to fix and that broad strokes aren&#x27;t enough. The chorus includes the line, &quot;Cause I don&#x27;t want my face to be / That poster child for being naive&quot;; and &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot;″s title is referred to as &quot;an epiphany&quot;, with Jackson mentioning that &quot;next time, I&#x27;ll know better&quot;. Album co-producer Jimmy Jam told the BBC: &quot;When you&#x27;re young, you feel like: &#x27;I can change the world! I&#x27;m going to lead the revolution!&#x27; And then you look 25 years later and you go: &#x27;OK, I should have known better. The same problems still exist but there&#x27;s a different way to go about tackling it. It still involves mobilising people, but I can&#x27;t do it by myself.&#x27; It&#x27;s just a wiser, more mature look at the reality of trying to make a positive change, a social change.&quot; In 2021, the Library of Congress announced it had selected &quot;Janet Jackson&#x27;s Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; for preservation and inducted it into the National Recording Registry. The album is one of 25 recordings inducted into the registry&#x27;s class of 2020 that are considered to be &quot;audio treasures worthy of preservation for all time based on their cultural, historical or aesthetic importance in the nation&#x27;s recorded sound heritage.&quot;

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives,  represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels, eight powered and coupled driving wheels and two trailing wheels. This type of steam locomotive is commonly known as the Mountain type, though the New York Central Railroad used the name [[New York Central Mohawk|Mohawk]] for their 4-8-2s.

==Overview==
The Colony of Natal in South Africa and New Zealand were innovators of the Mountain wheel arrangement. The Natal Government Railways (NGR) placed in service the first tank engines with the 4-8-2 arrangement, and the NGR was also first to modify tender locomotives to use a 4-8-2 wheel arrangement. The New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) introduced the first tender locomotives designed and built as 4-8-2.
In 1888, the Natal Government Railways placed the first five of its eventual one hundred Class D tank locomotives in service. The locomotive was designed by William Milne, the locomotive superintendent of the NGR from 1877 to 1896, and was built by Dübs &amp; Company. This was the first known use of the wheel arrangement.
In 1906, six NGR Class B Mastodon locomotives, designed by D.A. Hendrie, NGR Locomotive Superintendent from 1903 to 1910, were modified to a wheel arrangement by having trailing bissel trucks added below their cabs to improve their stability when hauling fast passenger trains. These altered Class B locomotives were the first tender locomotives in the world.

The first locomotive to be designed and built as a tender locomotive was New Zealand&#x27;s X class, designed by Alfred Beattie and built by NZR&#x27;s Addington Workshops in 1908. It was designed to haul heavy freight trains on the mountainous central section of the North Island Main Trunk. Some believed this was the source of the &quot;Mountain&quot; name of the type, although it is also possible that the name was originated by the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway in the United States, who named the type after the Allegheny Mountains. The X class was, however, not a typical Mountain type, since its trailing truck served to spread the axle load rather than to allow a larger and wider firebox. The trailing wheels were positioned well behind a narrow firebox, which itself sat above the coupled wheels, necessitating the same design compromise between coupled wheel diameter and grate size as on a  Consolidation or Mastodon. A more common design was a progression of the classic 4-6-2 Pacific layout, which featured a wide firebox positioned above the trailing truck and behind the coupled wheels, allowing for a wide and deep firebox as well as large coupled wheels.

The NGR in 1909 placed in service the first example of the more common Mountain design, when it commissioned five Class Hendrie D tender locomotives. It was designed by Hendrie to handle coal traffic on the upper Natal mainline and, while it was based on the Class Hendrie B , it had the firebox positioned to the rear of the coupled wheels to make a larger grate and ashpan possible. To accomplish this, the plate frame was equipped with a cast bridle at the rear to accommodate the improved firebox design, and the load also necessitated the addition of a trailing truck. Five locomotives were built by the North British Locomotive Company and delivered in 1909. The type went on to become the most widely used steam locomotive wheel arrangement in South Africa, with altogether thirty classes of both tank and tender versions eventually seeing service on the South African Railways.

==Usage==
===Angola===

In 1951, six locomotives were built by North British Locomotive Company to the design of the South African Class 19D for the Angolan Caminho de Ferro de Benguela (CFB or Benguela railway) as their 11th Class.

===Australia===
Unlike some other countries which utilised the design for heavy passenger duties, the Australian was more typically used as a heavy goods locomotive with small coupled wheels and a very large firebox.

The first in Australia was the gauge Q class of the Tasmanian Government Railways. Nineteen were built in batches between 1922 and 1945 by Perry Engineering in South Australia, Walkers Limited of Maryborough, Queensland and Clyde Engineering of New South Wales. Until 1950, the class handled the majority of mainline goods trains around the state.

Armstrong Whitworth built ten 500 class 4-8-2 locomotives for the South Australian Railways in 1926. They were the most powerful locomotives in Australia at the time and the heaviest non-articulated locomotives yet built in the United Kingdom. In 1929, they were modified to 500B class 4-8-4 Northern locomotives.
The three-cylinder D57 class locomotive of the New South Wales Government Railways (NSWGR) was one of the largest and most powerful locomotives ever built in Australia. Twenty-five were built by Clyde Engineering from 1929. With their large grates and tractive effort, they were put to good use on the steep, 1 in 33 (3%) and 1 in 40 (2½%) gradients leading out of Sydney on the New South Wales mainlines.

The D57 design was developed further in 1950 with the smaller cylindered D58 class, of which thirteen were built at the Eveleigh and Cardiff Locomotive Workshops of the NSWGR. This class proved to be less successful, suffering from reliability problems attributed to the rack and pinion valve gear that was used for the third cylinder instead of the Gresley-Holcroft valve gear that was used on the D57 class.
The Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) introduced two classes of 4-8-2 locomotives for freight haulage on the state&#x27;s network. The first was the S class, of which ten were built at the WAGR Midland Railway Workshops from 1943, with the locomotives named after West Australian mountains. The second was the W class, of which 64 were built by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company in 1951 and 1952. The 4-8-2 layout allowed for the weight of these relatively powerful locomotives to be spread over a number of axles, resulting in the W class having a maximum axle load of less than 10 tons. It also enabled the incorporation of a wide firebox for burning poor-quality coal.

In 1951, the Tasmanian Government Railways purchased a modern 4-8-2 locomotive, the H class. Eight locomotives were built by Vulcan Foundry for freight train working.

===Bulgaria===
In 1941, the Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ) placed an order with Henschel &amp; Son in Germany for fifty BDZ class 03 express passenger locomotives. They were of the type (2-4-1 axle arrangement, simple steam expansion, superheating, three-cylinder, fast train service) and were designed to be capable of hauling heavy passenger trains over the often severe profiles of the Bulgarian mainlines, with gradients of up to 2.8%.

The first two locomotives were delivered by the end of 1941. During trials, it proved that the specifications of the BDZ designing engineers were correct and that they had successfully overcome the shortcomings of insufficient power and some construction problems that had been experienced with the BDZ Mikado class 01 and class 02 locomotives. Mass production began the following year, but was interrupted by war restrictions introduced by the German authorities and delivery was halted before the full order was filled. Only ten more locomotives were built and delivered at the end of 1942 and early 1943, and the total number of the BDZ class 03 remained at twelve locomotives, numbered 03. to 03..

After 1958, these locomotives were gradually converted to mixed fuel oil and coal firing, which resulted in improved steaming ability and better performance, particularly on mountainous lines. During their 35 years of service, they exhibited excellent performance with only minor problems such as oval wear on the leading axle&#x27;s inside crank. After factory repair, one of these locomotives, no. 03., was preserved in the depot at Gorna Oryahovitsa and returned to operation for tourist trains. 

===Canada===
The Angus Shops of Canadian Pacific (CP) built a pair of locomotives in 1914. While they were not replicated, CP kept them in service for thirty years. CP reverted to 4-6-2 Pacific locomotives before moving on to the 4-6-4 Hudson.

Canadian National operated eighty U-1 class locomotives in passenger service, built by Montreal Locomotive Works in 1944. The last twenty, designated the U-1-f class, were delivered with semi-streamlined conical smokebox covers that earned them the nickname of &quot;Bullet Nose Bettys&quot;.

===Czechoslovakia===
The Czechoslovak State Railways (ČSD) introduced the 498.0 class express passenger locomotive in 1938 following successful trials in the Tatra Mountains comparing it to an alternative 2-8-4 Berkshire prototype. In 1954, the design was developed further into the 498.1 class. These technically sophisticated locomotives were reputedly capable of 11% thermal efficiency.

The ČSD also built a lighter and more numerous 475 class locomotive.

===France===
In France, the Mountain, known as the 241 type based on its axle arrangement, began to be used on the more undulating routes as increasingly heavy loads, brought about by the introduction of all-steel passenger cars after 1918, began to overtax the hill-climbing capabilities of the existing Pacific and the speed capabilities of Mikado locomotives. Altogether 275 locomotives were built for French service.
* The Chemins de fer de l&#x27;Est (Est) took delivery of a prototype four-cylinder compound locomotive from its own Épernay shops in 1925. This was the first Mountain type to be built for commercial service within France. The Est subsequently ordered forty production locomotives in 1930, based on the prototype design but with improvements. Delivery took place over the following three years. One of these, 241.004, ended up in Germany during World War II and served in the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn until 1955 as , the only Mountain in German service.
* Between 1930 and 1932, the Chemins de Fer de l&#x27;État (État) obtained 49 locomotives built to the design of the Est. Under SNCF management after 1938, these locomotives were transferred to the Est region and served there for the rest of their service lives.
* The Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée (PLM) introduced 145 bullet-nosed Class 241A compound Mountain types in 1925 to increase train speeds over the Seuil de Bourgogne incline. This four-cylinder compound locomotive was unusual in having short connecting rods for the outside high-pressure cylinders that connected to the first driving axle rather than the second, as was typical of most six- or eight-coupled locomotives. Possibly as a result of this, the locomotive did not run smoothly at speeds faster than . In addition, to limit the weight the built-up locomotive frames were lightly constructed, which allowed torsion and flexing that caused the wheel bearings to overheat. This problem was never solved on the PLM engines. However, despite these shortcomings and true to the Mountain type, they were still able to haul heavy passenger trains over gradients at speed and could take an 800 tonne load over a 1 in 200 gradient at .

* Based on the Class 241A, the unique PLM Class 241C1, built in 1930, had connecting rods linking the second and third driving axles. This locomotive served as the prototype for development of the post-war standard SNCF Class 241P.
* The PLM also experimented with a high-pressure watertube boiler on the unique PLM 241B1 prototype, constructed with a German Schmidt-Henschel boiler in 1930. Soon it was learned, however, that this locomotive was a failure; it was retired and broken up by the mid-1930s.
* The État also built a prototype three-cylinder simple expansion locomotive in 1932, the 241.101, which was an embarrassing failure for the company but which was later converted by André Chapelon into the legendary SNCF Class 242A1 4-8-4 Northern locomotive.
* The SNCF, with design input from André Chapelon, developed the earlier PLM 241C1 into the 35-strong Class 241P in 1948. These locomotives, although prone to axle box problems caused by a frame that was not rigid enough for the output of the cylinders, were nevertheless very effective and some were still running in the early 1970s.

===Mozambique===
In March and July 1973, twelve reboilered South African Railways Class 15BR locomotives, built by Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) in Canada between 1918 and 1922, were sold to Caminhos de Ferro de Moçambique (CFM), the Mozambique Railways, where they were mainly used for shunting at Lourenco Marques and occasionally on freight service to Swaziland.

===New Zealand===

The first of eighteen X class De Glehn compound locomotives, designed by Alfred Beattie, the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) between 1900 and 1913, was built by the NZR&#x27;s Addington Workshops in Christchurch in 1908. The first locomotive in the world to be designed and built as a tender locomotive, it was designed to haul heavy freight trains on the newly completed mountainous central section of the North Island Main Trunk. One member of the pioneering X class survives and is currently located at the depot of the Feilding and District Steam Rail Society.

Between 1940 and 1956, 91 J and JA class locomotives entered service. Of these, 56 were built by North British Locomotive Company and 35 by the Hillside Railway Workshops in Dunedin.
These locomotives survived in service until 1971 and were the last in-service steam locomotives on the NZR. Ten have been preserved.

===Philippines===
The Manila Railroad, now the Philippine National Railways, operated two classes before and after World War II. The first class was the pre-war 170 class. Ten locomotives were built in 1921 by Alco. Three units were refurbished after being damaged by the war. In 1948, another ten locomotives, numbered the 100-class, were ordered from the Pennsylvania-based Vulcan Iron Works. Another 10 were built in 1948. Both the rebuilt 170 class and the new 100 class were decommissioned starting in 1956, when MRR ordered the replacement of all its steam locomotives with diesel locomotives such as the GE UM12C. None of these locomotives were preserved like all of MRR&#x27;s steam locomotives.

===Poland===

In 1931 three Pu29 mountains were delivered to PKP. They were used predominantly to pull heavy trains between East Prussia exclave and main territory of Germany, transiting through the Polish Pomerania, also known as the Polish Corridor.

===Rhodesia===

====Northern Rhodesia====
Two locomotives were built in 1952 by Henschel &amp; Son to the design of the South African Class 19D, for the Nkana copper mines in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). They were numbered 337 and 338 in the Rhodesia Railways 19th class number range.

====Southern Rhodesia====

A lighter version of the South African Class 4A 4-8-2 was built for the Rhodesia Railways (RR) by North British Locomotive Company (NBL) in 1921. It was designated the RR 10th Class and was used on the long section south of Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) through Bechuanaland Protectorate (now Botswana) to Mafeking in the Cape Province. Like the South African Class 4A, the RR 10th Class had a combustion chamber, the only RR locomotive class with this feature.

Between 1951 and 1953, 21 locomotives were built for RR by Henschel &amp; Son to the design of the South African Class 19D, as their 19th class and 19C class. Their tenders were similar to the South African version&#x27;s &quot;Torpedo&quot;, but with plate frame instead of Buckeye bogies. One of these, the sole RR 19C class, was built as a condensing locomotive.

In 1955, four more, without superheating and numbered from 1 to 4, were built to the design of the South African Class 19D by NBL for the Wankie Colliery in Southern Rhodesia.

===South Africa===
;Tank locomotives
Of the thirty classes of locomotives to see service on the South African Railways (SAR), four were tank locomotives.
* The first locomotive in the world to be designed with this wheel arrangement was the Class D tank of the Natal Government Railways (NGR), the brain-child of Locomotive Superintendent William Milne and built by Dübs &amp; Company. Altogether 100 of these locomotives were delivered in ten batches between 1888 and 1899. In 1912, they came into SAR stock and were designated Class A.
* When the 4-10-2T Reid Tenwheelers of the NGR, designed by Locomotive Superintendent G.W. Reid, began to be withdrawn from mainline service for branch line and shunting duties c. 1909, they were gradually converted to a wheel arrangement by removing the fifth set of coupled wheels. In 1912, five such converted locomotives, originally built by Dübs between 1901 and 1903, were designated Class H2 on the SAR. The SAR converted many more Reid Ten-wheelers to , but reclassified only the first three of these to Class H2, while the rest retained their Class H classification even after modification.
* In 1902, the Imperial Military Railways placed 35 tank locomotives in service, built by Dübs and Neilson, Reid and Company to the specifications of the Reid Tenwheeler of the NGR. They became the Class E on the Central South African Railways, who converted six of them to tank locomotives. In 1912, the five survivors were designated Class H1 on the SAR.
* In 1904, the NGR placed 25 Class E tank locomotives in service. It was the first locomotive to be designed for the NGR by locomotive superintendent D.A. Hendrie and was built by North British Locomotive Company (NBL). In 1912, these locomotives were designated Class G by the SAR.

;Tender locomotives
Between 1909 and 1953, when the Class 25 and Class 25NC 4-8-4 Northern locomotives arrived on the scene, Mountain tender locomotives became the most popular goods locomotives on South African rails. Between 1906 and 1938 altogether 26 different classes of locomotives were acquired for mainline and branch line service.

In 1906, the NGR modified six of its Class B Mastodon locomotives, built by NBL in 1904, to Class Altered B locomotives to improve their stability on passenger trains. This made them the first tender locomotives in the world with a wheel arrangement. In 1912, they were classified as Class 1B by the SAR.

The SAR Class 3 originated on the NGR. Three variants were introduced between 1909 and 1912.

* In 1909, the NGR commissioned the first of thirty Class B (1909) tender locomotives, also known as the Hendrie D. Designed by D.A. Hendrie to handle coal traffic on the upper Natal mainline and based on his altered Class B Mountain of 1906, the firebox was positioned to the rear of the coupled wheels to make an improved grate and ashpan possible. Although not the first tender locomotives designed and built as 4-8-2, they were the first examples of the most common 4-8-2 design. They were built by NBL in 1909 and 1910. In 1912, they were designated  on the SAR.
* In 1910, the NGR placed a single experimental Class B &quot;American D&quot; locomotive in service, built by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO). The locomotive was similar to the Class B Hendrie D and was nicknamed &quot;Maude Allan&quot; by the enginemen. In 1912, it became the sole Class 3A on the SAR.
* In 1912, the SAR took delivery of ten Class 3B Mountain locomotives that had been ordered by the NGR the year before. Designed by Hendrie and built by NBL, these locomotives had plate frames, Walschaerts valve gear and Belpaire fireboxes and were the first of Hendrie&#x27;s designs to have superheaters and piston valves instead of slide valves.

The Class 4 originated on the Cape Government Railways (CGR). Two variants were introduced in 1911 and 1913.

* In 1911, the CGR placed two Mountain locomotives in service. Designed by chief locomotive superintendent H.M. Beatty as a heavy mixed traffic locomotive with Stephenson valve gear and that used saturated steam, they were built by NBL. They were not classified on the CGR but a year later, when they were taken onto the SAR roster, they were designated Class 4.
* In 1913 and 1914, ten Class 4A locomotives were placed in service by the SAR. Built by NBL, it was an improved version of the predecessor Class 4, with a superheater and Walschaerts valve gear. Like their two forerunners, they were excellent steamers and, with the improvements, gave a much better performance.

Three Class 12 variants were introduced by the SAR between 1912 and 1920.

* Between 1912 and 1922, the SAR placed 46 Class 12 locomotives in service. Designed by SAR chief mechanical engineer (CME) D.A. Hendrie for use in coal traffic on the line from Witbank to Germiston, they were the largest non-articulated locomotives in South Africa at the time. The first 26 were built by NBL between 1912 and 1915 and the remainder by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company (BP) in 1922.
* Between 1919 and 1929, 67 Class 12A locomotives entered service. It was the final locomotive design by Hendrie and one of his finest. An improved and larger version of his Class 12, with larger diameter cylinders and a redesigned boiler that included a combustion chamber, it was superheated and had Walschaerts valve gear and a Belpaire firebox. Forty-eight were built by NBL between 1919 and 1929 and 19 by Henschel &amp; Son in Germany in 1928 and 1929.
* In 1920, the SAR placed thirty Class 12B locomotives in service, built to the Class 12 design by Baldwin Locomotive Works in the United States. They were very similar to the second and subsequent orders of the Class 12 but were classified separately as Class 12B, possibly merely because they were American-built while the Class 12 was British-built.

Four Class 14 variants were introduced by the SAR between 1913 and 1918.
* Between 1913 and 1915, the SAR placed 45 Class 14 locomotives in service. Designed by Hendrie as a development of the Class 12, it was built by Robert Stephenson &amp; Company. With coupled wheels, it was evolved as intermediate locomotive between the Class 3B with its coupled wheels and the Class 12 with its coupled wheels.
* In 1914 and 1915, 41 Class 14A locomotives entered service. Also designed by Hendrie, it was a lighter locomotive for use on coastal lines and was built by NBL. Like the Class 14, it also had Walschaerts valve gear, a Belpaire firebox and was superheated, but it had a smaller boiler and smaller cylinders to reduce the axle loading.
* In 1915, fifteen Class 14B locomotives entered service. Built by BP, its intended use was on the lower section of the Natal mainline where speeds were low with frequent stops, and Hendrie therefore designed them without superheaters. In service, the omission of superheating soon became controversial; by 1927 all of them were converted to superheating and reclassified to Class 14. Of all the locomotives introduced by Hendrie, the Class 14B was the only one to fall short of expectations.

* Between 1918 and 1922, 73 Class 14C locomotives were ordered from the Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW), in Canada, as a result of wartime disruption in Europe. While built to Hendrie&#x27;s specifications, they were designed by MLW, resulting in a locomotive with some typical North American characteristics and with American-style high running boards. The locomotives were delivered in four batches, all four with different engine weights and maximum axle loads. Through re-boilerings and re-balancings during its service life, this single class eventually ended up as six different locomotive classes.

SAR introduced seven Class 15 variants between 1914 and 1938.
* In 1914, ten Class 15 locomotives entered service, built by NBL and designed by Hendrie as large mixed traffic locomotives with larger coupled wheels for use in the Orange Free State, where grades and curvature were less severe than on the coastal sections. To reduce the weight on the trailing wheels, steel fireboxes were used, a feature that became standard on large locomotives, but necessitated the introduction of water treatment plants in some parts of the country to prevent corrosion.

* Between 1914 and 1925, the SAR placed 119 Class 15A locomotives in service, delivered in ten batches from three manufacturers. Of the whole Hendrie-designed Mountain family, this class proved to be his most useful and most numerous group of locomotives. Being wartime, initial production and delivery occurred sporadically. NBL delivered 68 between 1914 and 1921, BP delivered thirty in 1920 and 1921, and J.A. Maffei delivered the last 21 in 1925.
* Between 1918 and 1922, thirty Class 15B locomotives entered service. As a result of wartime disruption in Europe, they were ordered from MLW in Canada. They were built to the general specifications of the Class 15, but with bar frames and some typical North American features, and they were equipped with Belpaire fireboxes with combustion chambers.
* In 1925 and 1926, the SAR placed twelve Class 15C locomotives in service, built by Baldwin Locomotive Works and conforming to SAR requirements as far as practicable, but also incorporating the latest American railway engineering practices. They introduced several new features to the SAR, such as top feeds to the boiler, self-cleaning smokeboxes, Sellar&#x27;s drifting valves and grease lubrication. Their fireboxes were equipped with siphon tubes to support the brick arch and to improve water circulation. The locomotive&#x27;s size quickly earned it the nickname &quot;Big Bill&quot;.
* Between 1926 and 1930, 84 Class 15CA locomotives entered service. It was a redesigned version of the Class 15C, with the frames widened under the firebox using a bridle casting. Twenty-three were built by ALCO in 1926, four by Baldwin in 1929, ten by &quot;Società Italiana Ernesto Breda&quot; of Milan in Italy in 1929 and 47 by NBL between 1928 and 1930.

* Between 1935 and 1937, the SAR placed 44 Class 15E locomotives in service. It was a refinement of the Class 15C and Class 15CA and was designed by CME A.G. Watson, incorporating many of his improvements including a vastly enlarged Watson Standard boiler and a Watson cab with a sloping front. Twenty were built by Robert Stephenson &amp; Hawthorns (RSH) in 1935, sixteen by Henschel in 1936, and eight by Berliner Maschinenbau in 1937. The locomotives had poppet valve gear and were fast, although some trouble was initially experienced with the gear in the reverse position.
* Between 1938 and 1946, 255 Class 15F locomotives were placed in service, making it the most numerous steam locomotive class in SAR service. It was similar to the Class 15E with a Watson Standard No. 3B boiler and a Watson cab, but with Walschaerts valve gear. It was designed by CME W.A.J Day and built in four batches in the eight years spanning World War II. In 1938, seven were built by Berliner, fourteen by Henschel and 44 by North British Locomotive Company. Locomotive-building was interrupted by the war, but because of a critical motive power shortage manufacturing was resumed even before hostilities had ceased. In 1944, production started with thirty locomotives by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company, followed by sixty by NBL in 1945. The final batch of 100 was built by NBL in 1946 and 1947. The pre-war Class 15Fs were hand-stoked and were delivered without smoke deflectors, while the post-war locomotives were built with mechanical stokers, smoke deflectors and vacuum brakes on the coupled wheels as well as on the tenders.

Five Class 19 variants were introduced by the SAR between 1928 and 1937.
* In 1928, the SAR placed four Class 19 locomotives in service. It was a lighter branch-line version of the classes 15C and 15CA mainline locomotives, built to the basic design of test engineer M.M. Loubser as requested by CME Colonel F.R. Collins DSO. Built on bar frames by Berliner in Germany, they were superheated and used Walschaerts valve gear.

* In 1929, 36 Class 19A locomotives entered service. It was a later model of the Class 19, but redesigned by Collins to achieve a lighter axle loading by reducing the coupled wheel diameter from , reducing the cylinder diameter from and by using a smaller boiler. They were built by Swiss Locomotive &amp; Machine Works (SLM).
* In 1930, fourteen Class 19B locomotives entered service. Built in Germany by Berliner, it was virtually identical to the Class 19 apart from the wheelbase of the front bogie, which had been increased from to to improve the clearance between the cylinders and the bogie wheels.
* Fifty Class 19C locomotives entered service in 1935, built by NBL to the design of the Class 19B, but with rotary cam poppet valve gear and Watson Standard No. 1A boilers. It had a larger superheater than the Class 19B and was equipped with a Watson cab with a sloping front that, like the Watson Standard boiler, was to become standard on later SAR steam locomotive classes. In a break with prior custom, the ash pan and running boards were affixed to the locomotive frame instead of to the boiler to facilitate easier removal of the boiler for repairs.
* Between 1937 and 1949, 235 Class 19D locomotives entered service, with the final development of the Class 19 series of locomotives having been done in 1937 by CME W.A.J. Day. The Class 19D, nicknamed &quot;Dolly&quot;, was very similar to its predecessor Class 19C, but with piston valves and Walschaerts valve gear instead of RC poppet gear. The locomotives were built in batches by several locomotive manufacturers. In 1937 and 1938, sixty were built by Friedrich Krupp AG and another sixty by the Borsig Lokomotiv Werke. In 1938, Škoda Works in Czechoslovakia built fifteen before locomotive-building was interrupted by the Second World War. In 1947, fifty were built by Robert Stephenson &amp; Hawthorns, and the final batch of fifty was delivered by NBL in 1949. The NBL locomotives were delivered with Type MX &quot;Torpedo&quot; tenders with cylindrical water tanks that ran on three-axle Buckeye bogies.
In 1938 and 1939, the SAR placed 136 Class 23 locomotives in service, its last and largest Mountain locomotive. Designed by Day, they were intended as a general utility locomotive capable of operating on rail. They were built in two batches by Berliner Maschinenbau and Henschel &amp; Son in Germany. The original order in 1938 was for twenty locomotives, of which Berliner built seven and Henschel thirteen. However, the urgency brought about by the rapidly deteriorating political climate in Europe at the time led to an additional 116 locomotives being ordered even before the first batch could be delivered and tested. Of these, Henschel built 85 and Berliner 31. The last locomotive of this second order was delivered in August 1939, just one month before the outbreak of the Second World War. Since they were intended for working in the arid Karoo, their very large tenders with a high water capacity rode on six-wheeled bogies.

===Spain===
Spain had more than 200 Mountain locomotives, known as the 241 type, in five classes.

The first type to be introduced, although earlier by only a few weeks, was the NORTE 4000 class, 4001–4047 in 1925 and 4049–4066 later. This was a huge four-cylinder compound machine with a working order weight and coupled wheels, a diameter that was believed to be ideal for passenger locomotives in the mountainous Peninsula. It performed very well on heavy express trains from Madrid to the French border in Irun. Although built in Spain, the type was of German design.

&quot;Compañía de los Ferrocarriles de Madrid a Zaragoza y Alicante&quot; (MZA) commissioned the 1700 type (1701–1795), built by &quot;La Maquinista Terrestre y Marítima&quot; (MTM) in Barcelona. It was a rude two-cylinder simple expansion locomotive, also with coupled wheels and slightly lighter than its NORTE counterpart, with the first ones of 1925 at 159.5 tonnes and the last ones of 1930 at 163.44 tonnes.

A controversy arose in Spain between the defenders of these two types. The 4000 was slightly more powerful, but the simplicity and reliability of the Spanish-designed 1700 was preferred.

The MZA commissioned an enhanced 1700 type, designed with a streamlined casing &quot;á la mode&quot; and designated the 1800 type. The Spanish Civil War interrupted construction and the ten machines were only completed after the war ended in 1939. Although well-designed and good performers in theory, they lacked the advantages of streamlined casing and especially suffered from problems associated with the high-pressure boiler, which needed specially-designed lubricators that were not available in impoverished post-war Spain.

The NORTE launched the 4648 just before RENFE was established in 1941. It was an enhanced 4600 type with new designed cylinders after the proposals of André Chapelon. The locomotive was slightly more powerful than her sisters and RENFE commissioned 28 more to be built between 1946 and 1948. The increased capacity of the new machines never reached its full potential, however, due to the lack of maintenance typical of post-war Spain.

In 1944, RENFE commissioned the 2700 type to run on former MZA lines. The type used the high-capacity boiler designed for the 2-10-2 Santa Fe type of 1942. They were very powerful machines with weights exceeding 204 tonnes and with coupled wheels. They performed well and were appreciated by the crews who called them &quot;Bonitas&quot; (prettys). A coal-fired and stoker-equipped design, they were converted to oil-firing in the 1950s. Construction ceased in 1952, with 57 locomotives having been built. The last one was retired in 1973. One is preserved (241-2238F) in Móra la Nova (Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain) for the APPFI enthusiast association that intends to restore it to running order.

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom&#x27;s entire population of Mountain locomotives consists of &quot;Hercules&quot; and &quot;Samson&quot;, the two gauge locomotives of the Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Railway in Kent, England. The locomotives were built by Davey Paxman in 1927.

The Southern Railway considered using 4-8-2s for express trains before changing to the 2-8-2 and eventually 4-6-2 design, leading to the Bulleid pacifics. The London and North Eastern Railway had designs for 4-8-2s, but during WWII the British government forbid the development of express passenger locomotives, so the plans were dropped. Following the LNER chief mechanical engineer Sir Nigel Gresley’s death from illness in 1941, neither Edward Thompson nor Arthur Peppercorn resumed the 4-8-2 project, and after the United Kingdom nationalized private railway companies into British Railways in 1948, only 4-6-2s were pursued as express locomotives with the BR Standard Class 6 and 7 (though they were classified as mixed-traffic), as well as rebuilt versions of the aforementioned 4-6-2s of Bulleid’s design, which would last until dieselization.

===United States===

The was most popular on the North American continent. When the 4-6-2 Pacific fleets were becoming overburdened as passenger trains grew in length and weight, the first North American locomotives were built by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) in 1911. It is possible that the &quot;Mountain&quot; name was originated by C&amp;O, after the Allegheny Mountains where their first locomotives were built to work. ALCO combined the traction of the eight-coupled 2-8-2 Mikado with the excellent tracking qualities of the Pacific&#x27;s four-wheel leading truck. Although C&amp;O intended their new Mountains for passenger service, the type also proved ideal for the new, faster freight services that railroads in the United States were introducing. Many locomotives were therefore built for dual service.

About 2,200 Mountain type locomotives were built for 41 American railroads. With 600 locomotives, the largest user in the United States was the New York Central Railroad (NYC). The &quot;Water Level Route&quot; eschewed the hilly moniker in favor of Mohawk type.

Other large users in the United States were the Pennsylvania Railroad with 301 Class M1, Class M1a and Class M1b locomotives that were used mostly for fast freight service, the Florida East Coast with ninety passenger locomotives, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad with seventy, and the Southern Railway with fifty-eight.

The heaviest s in the world were twenty-three St. Louis–San Francisco Railway 4400 class locomotives, built by the railroad between 1939 and 1945, using boilers from older 2-10-2 locomotives, riding cast frames, and weighing over . These were a follow-up to the road&#x27;s 4300 class, similarly rebuilt at the road&#x27;s Springfield, Missouri shops with some parts from 2-10-2s and new cast frames, but with new 250 psi boilers.

The most powerful 4-8-2s in the world were twenty 2600 class locomotives (Nos. 2600-2619) owned by the Illinois Central Railroad; they were equipped with boilers, and they were able to produce a tractive effort of . The 2600&#x27;s were constructed in the early 1940s at the Illinois Central&#x27;s own locomotive shops in Paducah, Kentucky, and they were among 146 4-8-2 locomotives the railroad rostered.

The Southern Pacific Railroad ordered seventy-five MT-class 4-8-2s from ALCO for both freight and passenger service.

One notable example is SLSF 1522, one of thirty T-54 class Mountains built by Baldwin in 1926. It became the only North American 4-8-2 to have pulled multiple mainline excursion trains. It pulled excursions from 1988 to 2002, but rising insurance rates and a flue sheet cracked beyond repair forced it back into retirement. No. 1522 is now on display at the National Museum of Transportation in St Louis.

<text>Jason Douglas Elam (; born March 8, 1970) is an American former professional football player who was a placekicker in the National Football League (NFL), primarily with the Denver Broncos. He was selected by Denver in the third round of the 1993 NFL draft and played 15 seasons with the Broncos and two with the Atlanta Falcons.

A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Elam won two Super Bowl rings with the Broncos and was tied with Tom Dempsey, Sebastian Janikowski, and David Akers for the longest field goal in NFL history at 63 yards. That record was broken by another Bronco, Matt Prater, in 2013 with a 64-yard field goal, which was then broken by Justin Tucker in 2021 with a 66-yard field goal.

==Early life==
Elam attended Brookwood High School in Snellville, Georgia, and lettered in football, swimming and track. In football, he was a first-team all-county honoree and second-team all-state.

==College career==
In four years (1988–1992) as the placekicker for the University of Hawaii at Mānoa football team, Elam scored the third-most points in NCAA history (397) and tied for the second-most field goals kicked (79). He held the record for all-time leading scorer in the Western Athletic Conference until 2010 and was a three-time All-WAC selection. He is Hawaii&#x27;s career leader in field goals made and field goal percentage. Elam majored in communications at the University of Hawaii.

==Professional career==

===Denver Broncos===
Elam was drafted by the Broncos in the third round (70th pick overall) of the 1993 NFL draft.

Elam holds NFL records for best extra point conversion percentage (.995), most consecutive seasons with at least 100 points (15), fastest to 300 successful field goals, and fastest to 1,600 and 1,700 points. Elam was also the first player in NFL history to score at least 200 points against three or more teams: the San Diego Chargers (222), Oakland Raiders (215), and Kansas City Chiefs (203). Elam is tied with Steve Christie, Jason Hanson, and Jim Breech for the most overtime field goals with nine. Elam was named to the Denver Broncos 50th Anniversary Team in 2009.

====1994====
Elam scored 119 points throughout his rookie season, placing him fourth in the AFC (seventh in NFL) for points scored, while his 26 field goals tied for the fourth-highest total in team history. Elam was successful on four of six field goal attempts longer than 50 yards. His 54-yarder against San Diego Chargers was the fourth-longest in team history.

====1995====
In 1995, he finished tied for third in the NFL in scoring with 132 points and tied for second in field goals made with 31 as he was voted to his first Pro Bowl. On the season, he was 31 for 38 (.816) on field-goal attempts and 39 for 39 on extra-point attempts. His breakthrough season also included second-team All-Pro honors from both Associated Press and All-AFC honors from Pro Football Weekly. He set the tone for his stellar season in the opener vs. Buffalo Bills, tying a Broncos single-game record with five successful field goals in six attempts (22, 52, 20, 38 and 37 yards). His 56-yarder at Houston was the longest of his career and the second longest in franchise history behind Steinfort 57-yarder vs. Washington in 1980. Elam made a franchise-record 13 consecutive field goals during the middle of the season, beginning with a 30-yarder at Seattle Seahawks and ending with a 35-yarder vs. the Chargers. On December 24 vs. the Oakland Raiders, Elam scored 11 points, including the game-winning 37-yard field goal with 48 seconds remaining, in Denver&#x27;s 31–28 victory. It was the second time in 1995 that Elam had kicked a game-winning field goal in the final minute.

====1996====
In 1996, he converted 21 of 28 field goal attempts with a .750 percentage and all 46 extra-point attempts to lead the Broncos with 109 points. He also tied the team record for most extra points in a game with six against the Baltimore Ravens in a 45–34 Broncos win. He connected on his only 50-yard-plus field goal of the 1996 season at San Diego in the regular-season finale.

====1997====
In the 1997 season, he converted 26 of 36 field-goal attempts (.722) and tied his own franchise record for extra points in a season by going a perfect 46 of 46. His 124 total points on the season ranked second in the AFC (fourth in the NFL), and his 46 extra points led the AFC and were second in the NFL. During the postseason, he was perfect, converting all 15 extra-point attempts and both field goal attempts of 43 and 51 yards. His 51-yard field goal in Super Bowl XXXII against the Green Bay Packers was the second longest in Super Bowl history since Steve Christie&#x27;s 54-yarder for the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVIII as well as the longest in Broncos postseason history. He passed the 500-point plateau with his final extra-point attempt at Seattle, becoming only the third Bronco in history to do so and the fastest in terms of games played (66). He also kicked the game-winning 33-yard field goal in overtime at Buffalo, the second time in his career that Elam had won a game for the Broncos in overtime. He tied his own franchise record with five field goals at Kansas City Chiefs, matching the standard achieved previously by himself.

====1998====
In 1998, Elam was selected to his second Pro Bowl and was named second-team All-NFL by the Associated Press and All-AFC by Pro Football Weekly and Football News. He enjoyed his finest season statistically in 1998, converting 23 of 27 field goal attempts for a career-best and franchise-record percentage of .852. He also made all 58 extra-point attempts for 127 total points.

On October 25, 1998, Elam kicked a 63-yard field goal to end the first half against the Jacksonville Jaguars, tying Tom Dempsey&#x27;s 28-year-old record for the longest field goal in NFL history. His cleats from the game are currently on display in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Elam also scored the 20,000th televised point on &quot;ABC Monday Night Football&quot;. He tied for third in the AFC (tied for fifth in the NFL) in scoring by kickers, and his 58 extra-point conversions ranked second in the NFL while also representing a team record for a single season. He also made six of eight field goal attempts and all 11 extra-point attempts for a team-leading 29 points in three postseason contests to move into second place in all-time postseason scoring by a Bronco. Elam converted two of four field goal attempts in Super Bowl XXXIII versus Atlanta Falcons and all four extra points for 10 points in the Broncos 34–19 win, earning his second Super Bowl Ring in his career. Against the Dallas Cowboys, he tied a franchise record that he already shared with four other players by converting six extra-point attempts. He set a franchise record for consecutive field goals made at Kansas City on Monday Night Football, converting his 14th in a row to top Rich Karlis&#x27; previous standard of 13 (1984–85), and he ran his streak to 19 consecutive before having a 37-yard attempt blocked vs. the Chiefs.

====1999====
In 1999, he converted all 29 extra-point attempts and was 29 of 36 (.806) on field-goal attempts to account for 116 points on the season, tied for fifth in the AFC and tied for sixth in the league. He was 5–7 on field-goal attempts between 50 and 59 yards in 1999 to improve his career percentage from that range to 63.7 percent (21–33). He was successful from 50 yards at Kansas City, 51 yards against the New York Jets, 55 yards at San Diego, 53 yards against Oakland and 50 against San Diego again. The 55-yarder at San Diego was the third longest of his career, the effort earned Elam AFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors for Week 9 as he made four field goals and scored 15 points in the game, his highest single-game totals for both categories since setting career highs with five field goals and 16 points at Kansas on November 16, 1997. Elam matched the four field goal effort vs. Oakland on Monday Night Football with one of the most pressure-filled conversions of his career from 53 yards with seven seconds remaining to tie the score at 21 and send the game to overtime. It proved to be the eighth game-winning or game-saving field goal of his career as the Broncos went on to win 27–21.

====2000====
In 2000, Elam was 18 of 24 (.750) on field-goal attempts and 49 of 49 on extra-point attempts to account for 103 points on the season, 10th most in the AFC. With his three PAT attempts at the New York Jets, he passed Jim Turner for most PAT attempts in Denver history and became the first Bronco to make 200 field goals in a career with his successful boot from 26 yards vs. San Diego. His five extra points at New Orleans gave him an NFL record for consecutive extra points, breaking Norm Johnson&#x27;s standard of 301 (Elam finished the season having made 313 consecutive PATs).

====2001====
In 2001, he was voted to his third Pro Bowl was also named the NFL 2001 Special Teams Player of the Year by the NFL Alumni and voted second-team All-NFL. He led the NFL in field goals with a franchise record-tying 31 while also tying for third in the league with 124 points. The AFC Special Teams Player of the Month for November, Elam converted a franchise-record 86.1 percent of his field goals (31 of 36) and all 31 extra-point attempts to extend his NFL record for consecutive extra points to 344. Elam enjoyed a record-setting night at Oakland, hitting two field goals, including a 39-yarder that gave him his 1,000th career point to make him the 30th NFL player to reach that plateau as well as extend his franchise scoring record. He scored 14 points against San Diego with a season-high four field goals, hitting from 25, 29, 26 and 33 yards, as well as two PATs.

For the second time in three games, he scored a season-high 14 points at Dallas, hitting four field goals (24, 50, 46 and 28 yds.) and both extra-point opportunities. He was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Month for November when he led all NFL kickers with 38 points and 11 field goals. He converted 11 of 12 field-goal attempts (.917) during the month, including two from beyond 45 yards, tied his career single-season high with his 31st field goal of the year in the season finale vs. the Indianapolis Colts, matching his mark from 1995.

====2002====
In the 2002 season, he converted 26 of 36 field-goal attempts (.722) and 42 of 43 (.977) extra-point attempts to account for a team-leading 120 points, marking his 10th consecutive season with 100 or more points. Also in 2002, he tied his career-high with five field goals (on five attempts) vs. the Miami Dolphins, including a 55-yard kick. He also tied a career-high by scoring 16 points in the contest, he made all three field-goal attempts at Kansas City, including the game-winner from 25 yards in overtime. It was his 11th career game-winning or game-saving field goal and his third in an overtime situation, Elam, who at the time owned the NFL record for consecutive extra points (371, later broken by Matt Stover), saw the streak end against Indianapolis Colts.

====2003====
In 2003, he played all 16 regular-season games and converted 27 of 31 field goal attempts (.871) and all 39 extra point attempts to account for 120 points, third most in the AFC (fourth in NFL) among kickers. In the season opener at the Cincinnati Bengals, he made all three field goal attempts (51, 27, 39) and totaled 12 points to eclipse the 1,200-point plateau (1,205), doing so in fewer games than any player in NFL history (157 games). Against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Elam made his first game-winning field goal of the season when he connected on a 47-yarder as time expired. With the field goal, he surpassed Jim Breech and moved into 19th place on the NFL&#x27;s all-time scoring list with 1,249 points. He added three field goals, including a 51-yarder, against the Cleveland Browns and became the fastest player in NFL history to reach 1,300 points in 170 games and the first player in NFL history to score more than 100 points in each of his first 11 seasons. He earned AFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors. It marked the first time in Elam&#x27;s career that he made field goals to send a game to overtime and then win the game in overtime. The overtime field goal was his sixth career “walk-off” field goal (four OT, two at the end of regulation).

====2004====
In 2004, Elam connected on 29 of 34 field-goal attempts (.853) with a long of 52 yards for the Broncos. He accounted for 129 of Denver 381 points in 2004 (87 points on field goals, 42 on PATs) for his 12th consecutive 100-point season. Also in 2004, he notched in 300th career field goal against the Carolina Panthers, becoming the fastest kicker in NFL history to reach that mark and one of only 16 kickers with 300 or more field goals. He helped Denver overcome a stingy defense vs. the Tampa Bay Buccaneers by hitting all three field goals that day to earn AFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors for the fourth time in his career. In addition to making a 50-yard field goal against the Buccaneers in the second quarter, he added a clutch fourth-quarter 23-yarder to secure a win that marked his 16th career game-winning or game-tying field goal. Elam took over sole possession of second place on the NFL all-time consecutive scoring streak list (187 games with at least one point) vs. the Tennessee Titans, making three of four field goals and all four PATs against the Titans while passing Matt Bahr for 15th place on the NFL all-time scoring list.

In 2005, he connected on 24 of 32 field goals for a .750 percentage and 43 of 44 PATs to total 115 points that ranked fifth in the AFC and ninth in the NFL among kickers. He also surpassed the 1,500-point plateau faster than any player in league history, doing so in just 197 games. With his performance versus the New England Patriots in an AFC Divisional Playoff Game, he became the Broncos postseason leader in field goals (15) and points (84). He converted both extra-point attempts and connected on field goals of 41 and 45 yards in the home opener against San Diego. The 41-yarder came with five seconds remaining in regulation and gave the Broncos a 20–17 win, marking the 18th game-winning field goal of his career. He set career highs in PAT attempts and conversions in a game by connecting on all seven extra-point attempts vs. the Philadelphia Eagles. He also reached the 1,500-point plateau faster than any player in league history as he eclipsed the milestone with an extra point in the second quarter against the Oakland Raiders in his 197th career game. On Thanksgiving Day against the Dallas Cowboys, Elam connected on his only field-goal attempt of 24 yards in overtime as well as all three PATs. The overtime field goal was the 19th game-winning field goal of his career.

In 2006, his 14th season with the Broncos, Elam moved into seventh place on the league&#x27;s all-time field goals made list (368) and ninth on the league all-time points scored list (1,672) as he connected on 27 of 29 field goal attempts (.931), setting a Denver single-season record for accuracy, along with all 34 PATs. His 115 points ranked ninth in the NFL, and he became the first kicker in league history to post at least 100 points in each of his first 14 seasons. Elam scored at least once in every game to extend his scoring streak to 220 games, in every game of his career, marking the second-longest such streak in league history. He accounted for all of the Broncos points as he connected on three of four field goals, including a 39-yarder in overtime, in the home opener versus Kansas City. He tied Eddie Murray for eighth on the league all-time points scored list with 352 successful field goals as he hit his lone attempt against Indianapolis and became the fastest player in NFL history to reach the 1,600-point mark in 211 games. Against the Arizona Cardinals, he moved into a tie with Fred Cox (455) for twelfth in league history in field goal attempts and passed Nick Lowery (562) to move into seventh place in league history in extra points made by making three field goals.

====2007====
In his last season as a Denver Bronco, he scored in all 16 games, connecting on 27 of 31 field goal tries and all 33 extra point attempts for 114 points. Against the San Diego Chargers, he surpassed the record of 233 games played as a Bronco by John Elway. He hit three game-winning field goals on the last play of those games as well as hitting one as time expired to send a game into overtime. He nailed the game-winning 42-yard field goal as time expired for the 21st game-winning or game-saving kick of his career in the season opener against the Buffalo Bills. He earned AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance in the home opener as he connected on field goals of 23, 20 and 23 yards and both extra points vs. Oakland, then made the winning field goal in OT. He reached the 1,700-point plateau faster than any player (224 games) as he tallied eight points (two FG and two PAT) at the Indianapolis Colts and connected on field goals from 21 and 39 yards as well as all four extra point attempts on Monday Night Football vs. the Tennessee Titans and moved into sixth all-time in points scored in the NFL with 1,746. He hit both field goal attempts of 43 and 30 yards, including the overtime winner in the season finale vs. the Minnesota Vikings.

While with the Broncos, Elam reached seventh place on the NFL&#x27;s all-time points scored list. He reached that position with a game-winning 48-yard field goal on October 21, 2007, giving him 1,712 career points, converted four extra points and a 49-yard field goal on Sunday Night Football vs. Pittsburgh. He connected on attempts from 45 and 21 yards as well as an extra point on Monday Night Football against the Green Bay Packers. His 21-yard field goal against the Packers was his 24th either game-winning or game-saving field goal as it tied the score at 13 as regulation time expired. He booted an extra point and missed a 48-yard field goal against the Detroit Lions. The overtime kick against the Vikings was also the 12th walk-off kick of his career. His two successful field goals extended his streak of successful kicks to 15, the third-longest streak in team history. He also moved into sole possession of seventh place in field goal attempts (490) and became just the sixth player in league history to make 600 extra points. Elam also kicked four game-winning field goals, becoming the first player to do so since at least 1990.

===Atlanta Falcons===

====2008====
On March 21, 2008, the Atlanta Falcons signed Elam to a four-year, $9 million contract with $3.3 million guaranteed. Against the Detroit Lions, he split the uprights on both attempts, his first two in a Falcons uniform. Elam extended his streak of consecutive field goals to 17 and also notched his 38th field goal of 50-plus yards. Against Tampa Bay he made three field goals, all of Atlanta&#x27;s points in the game.

In week 6 against the Chicago Bears, Elam made five of six field goal attempts from 29, 48, 32, 41, and 48 yards. Chicago came off a miscue with a 77-yard touchdown drive to take a 20–19 lead with 11 seconds to play. Coming off a 26-yard strike from rookie quarterback Matt Ryan to Michael Jenkins, Elam&#x27;s kick of 48 yards was converted with one second left in the game to clinch a Falcons victory. Along with adding one PAT, Elam accounted for 16 points. His two kicks of 48 yards tied for the second-longest that season. Elam missed a kick from 33 yards in the fourth quarter, which ended a streak of 29 consecutive field goals dating back to the 2007 season. His five field goals made, six field goals attempted and 16 points all tied career-highs.

====2009====

In 2009, Elam was only eight for 15 in field goals over 30 yards. He was waived on December 1, 2009.

===Retirement===
On March 30, 2010, Elam signed a one-day ceremonial contract with Denver so he could retire as a Bronco.

==Career regular season statistics==
&quot;Career high/best bolded&quot;
;Franchise Records
&#x27;s NFL off-season, Jason Elam held at least 8 Broncos franchise records, including:
* Extra Points: career (601), game (5 on 2000-10-15 CLE; with Connor Barth), playoffs (39), playoff season (15 in 1997), playoff game (5 on 1999-01-09 MIA)
* Field Goals: career (395), season (31 in 1995, 2001), playoffs (15)

==Personal life==
Elam has a wife, Tammy (a former Broncos cheerleader), four sons (Jason Jr., Joshua Matthew Jackson Asher, and Jude Dawson) and two daughters (Jordan Noel and Julianna Grace).

===Books===
Elam published his first book in January 2008, titled &quot;Monday Night Jihad&quot;. He co-wrote it with Steve Yohn, currently pastor at Strasburg Community Church in Strasburg, CO. The book is an action-adventure tale about football and an attempt to stop a terrorist plot.

In a statement issued by his publisher, Elam said, &quot;The genesis of &quot;Monday Night Jihad&quot; goes back almost 10 years...My brother kept a journal of all the crazy football stories I&#x27;d told him over the years. About a year-and-a-half ago, I began to think what if I was able combine all those quirky stories with a terrorist element to create an action-adventure story. Through this story, I want to bring out why people of strong conviction do what they do.&quot;

In December 2008, Elam and Yohn released &quot;Blown Coverage&quot;, the second book in the Riley Covington Thriller series. In December 2009 &quot;Blackout&quot;, the third book was released, and the series was completed with &quot;Inside Threat&quot;, released June 2011.

===Other media===
Jason and his wife were featured in a 2012 episode of &quot;Buying Alaska&quot; where they purchased an island home in Sitka, Alaska, to live in with their family.

<text>Mizraim (; cf. ) is the Hebrew and Aramaic name for the land of Egypt and its people.
==Linguistic analysis==
&quot;&quot; is the Hebrew cognate of a common Semitic source word for the land now known as Egypt. It is similar to &quot;&quot; in modern Arabic, &quot;&quot; in the 14th century B.C. Akkadian Amarna tablets, &quot;&quot; in Ugaritic, &quot;Mizraim&quot; in Neo-Babylonian texts, and &quot;Mu-ṣur&quot; in neo-Assyrian Akkadian (as seen on the Rassam cylinder). To this root is appended the dual suffix &quot;-āyim&quot;, perhaps referring to the &quot;two Egypts&quot;: Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt. This word is similar in pronunciation and spelling to the Hebrew words &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, meaning literally &quot;siege&quot; and &quot;strait, distress&quot; respectively, and may carry those connotations to Hebrew speakers.

==Biblical accounts==
According to Genesis 10, Mizraim, son of Ham was the younger brother of Cush and elder brother of Phut whose families together made up the Hamite branch of Noah&#x27;s descendants. Mizraim&#x27;s sons were Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, Pathrusim, Casluhim, and Caphtorim. 19th-century scholar Henry Welsford identifies this Mizraim of Egypt in the Book of Genesis as Minos.

In the Book of Exodus, it is considered the &quot;house of bondage&quot;. Regarding Passover, Moses says to the Israelites, &quot;And Moses said to the people, &#x27;Remember this day, on which you went free from Egypt, the house of bondage, how יהוה freed you from it with a mighty hand: no leavened bread shall be eaten.&#x27;&quot;

The book of Deuteronomy forbids the children of Israel from abhorring a &quot;Mizri&quot;, an Egyptian, &quot;because you were a stranger in his land.&quot;

==Greco-Roman sources==
According to Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot;, Manetho had suggested that the great age of antiquity of which the later Egyptians boasted had preceded the Great Flood and that they were descended from Mizraim, who settled there anew. According to Byzantine chronicler George Syncellus, the &quot;Book of Sothis&quot;, attributed to Manetho, identified Mizraim with the legendary first pharaoh, Menes, who is said to have unified the Old Kingdom of Egypt and built Memphis. Mizraim also seems to correspond to Misor, who is said in Phoenician mythology to have been the father of Taautus, who was given Egypt, and later scholars noticed that it also recalls Menes, whose son or successor was said to be Athothis.

==Islamic sources==
According to medieval Islamic historians, such as Sibt ibn al-Jawzi, the Egyptian ibn &#x27;Abd al-Hakam, and the Persians al-Tabari and Muhammad Khwandamir, the pyramids, etc. had been built by the wicked races before the Deluge but that Noah&#x27;s descendant Mizraim (Masar or Mesr) was later entrusted with reoccupying the region. The Islamic accounts also make Masar the son of a Bansar or Beisar and grandson of Ham, rather than a direct son of Ham, and add that he lived to the age of 700.

<text>USS &quot;Scorpion&quot; was a schooner of the United States Navy during the War of 1812. She was the second USN ship to be named for the scorpion. The British captured her on 6 September 1814 and took her into service as HMS &quot;Confiance&quot;. She was placed in Ordinary in 1817 and broken up in 1831.

==Career==
&quot;Scorpion&quot; was launched in the spring of 1813 at Presque Isle (now Erie, Pennsylvania), probably by Noah Brown of New York, for service on the upper Great Lakes during the War of 1812.

&quot;Scorpion&quot;, commanded by Sailing Master Stephen Champlin, first cousin to Oliver Hazard Perry, operated with Commodore Perry&#x27;s squadron on Lake Erie during the summer and fall of 1813.

On 10 September 1813, she participated in the battle off Put-in-Bay, Lake Erie, which resulted in the defeat and capture of a British squadron (see Battle of Lake Erie). &quot;Scorpion&quot; had the distinction of firing the first and last shot in the battle in which she lost two men. At the close of the action, she and pursued and captured the fleeing British schooners and .

After Perry&#x27;s victory, &quot;Scorpion&quot; assisted General William Henry Harrison&#x27;s forces operating in the Thames River area, by transporting troops as well as stores and ammunition captured from the enemy.

During the winter of 1813 and 1814, she was laid up at Erie, Pennsylvania. From May 1814 to September 1814, &quot;Scorpion&quot; cruised on Lake Erie and Lake Huron, cooperating with the army in the Detroit area by transporting troops, staking out the flats through the St. Clair River, and blockading the enemy at the Nottawasaga River and Lake Simcoe.

==Capture and fate==

On 6 September 1814, while on blockade duty on Lake Huron, &quot;Scorpion&quot;, under command of Daniel Turner, was surprised and captured by the former American schooner, , which also had been taken by the British a few days earlier. Both vessels and prisoners were taken to Fort Mackinac.

&quot;Scorpion&quot; was subsequently taken into the Royal Navy as the four-gun schooner &quot;Confiance&quot;, which along with &quot;Tigress&quot;, according to local legend, was later sunk in Georgian Bay, Lake Huron, off Penetanguishene, Ontario. In fact both vessels were laid up and dismantled at Colborne Basin, Ontario.

<text>USS &quot;Scorpion&quot; (SSN-589) was a &quot;Skipjack&quot;-class nuclear-powered submarine that served in the United States Navy, the sixth vessel and second submarine to carry that name.

&quot;Scorpion&quot; sank on 27 May 1968. She is one of two nuclear submarines that the U.S. Navy has lost, the other being . She was one of the four submarine disappearances in 1968, the others being the Israeli submarine , the , and the .

The wreckage of the &quot;Scorpion&quot; remains in the North Atlantic Ocean with all its armaments and nuclear reactor.

== Service ==

&quot;Scorpion&quot;″s keel was laid down 20 August 1958 by General Dynamics Electric Boat in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched 19 December 1959, sponsored by Elizabeth S. Morrison, the daughter of the last commander of the World War II-era , Lt. Cdr. Maximilian Gmelich Schmidt (that ship was also lost with all hands, in 1944). &quot;Scorpion&quot; was commissioned 29 July 1960, with Commander Norman B. Bessac in command. 

=== Service: 1960–1967 ===
Assigned to Submarine Squadron 6, Division 62, &quot;Scorpion&quot; departed New London, Connecticut, on 24 August for a two-month European deployment. During that time, she participated in exercises with 6th Fleet units and NATO-member navies. After returning to New England in late October, she trained along the Eastern Seaboard until May 1961. On 9 August 1961, she returned to New London, moving to Norfolk, Virginia, a month later. In 1962, she earned a Navy Unit Commendation.

Norfolk was &quot;Scorpion&quot;″s homeport for the remainder of her career, and she specialized in developing nuclear submarine warfare tactics. Varying roles from hunter to hunted, she participated in exercises along the Atlantic Coast, and in Bermuda and Puerto Rico operating areas. From June 1963 to May 1964, she underwent an overhaul at Charleston. She resumed duty in late spring, but regular duties were again interrupted from 4 August to 8 October for a transatlantic patrol. In the spring of 1965, she conducted a similar patrol in European waters.

In 1966, she deployed for special operations. After completing those assignments, her commanding officer received a Navy Commendation Medal for outstanding leadership, foresight, and professional skill. Other &quot;Scorpion&quot; officers and crewmen were also cited for meritorious achievement. &quot;Scorpion&quot; is reputed to have entered an inland Russian sea during a &quot;Northern Run&quot; in 1966, where the crew filmed a Soviet missile launch through her periscope before fleeing from Soviet Navy ships.

=== Overhaul: 1967 ===
On 1 February 1967, &quot;Scorpion&quot; entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for a refueling overhaul. Instead of a much-needed complete overhaul, though, she received only emergency repairs to get quickly back on duty. The preferred SUBSAFE program required increased submarine overhaul times, from 9 to 36 months. SUBSAFE required intensive vetting of submarine component quality, coupled with various improvements and intensified structural inspections – particularly of hull welding, using ultrasonic testing.

Cold War pressures had prompted U.S. Submarine Force Atlantic (SUBLANT) officers to cut corners. The last overhaul of the &quot;Scorpion&quot; cost one-seventh of those performed on other nuclear submarines at the same time. This was the result of concerns about the &quot;high percentage of time offline&quot; for nuclear attack submarines, estimated at 40% of total available duty time.

&quot;Scorpion&quot;″s original &quot;full overhaul&quot; was reduced in scope. Long-overdue SUBSAFE work, such as a new central valve control system, was not performed. Crucially, her emergency system was not corrected for the same problems that destroyed &quot;Thresher&quot;. While Charleston Naval Shipyard claimed the emergency main ballast tank blow (EMBT) system worked as-is, SUBLANT claimed it did not, and their EMBT was &quot;tagged out&quot; (listed as unusable). Perceived problems with overhaul duration led to a delay on all SUBSAFE work in 1967.

Chief of Naval Operations Admiral David Lamar McDonald approved &quot;Scorpion&quot;″s reduced overhaul on 17 June 1966. On 20 July, McDonald deferred SUBSAFE extensions, otherwise deemed essential since 1963.
=== Service: 1967–1968 ===
In late October 1967, &quot;Scorpion&quot; started refresher training and weapons-system acceptance tests, and was given a new commanding officer, Francis Slattery. Following type training out of Norfolk, Virginia, she got underway on 15 February 1968 for a Mediterranean Sea deployment. She operated with the 6th Fleet into May and then headed west for home.

&quot;Scorpion&quot; suffered several mechanical malfunctions, including a chronic problem with freon leakage from refrigeration systems. An electrical fire occurred in an escape trunk when a water leak shorted out a shore power connection. No evidence was found that &quot;Scorpion&quot;″s speed was restricted in May 1968, although it was conservatively observing a depth limitation of , due to the incomplete implementation of planned post-&quot;Thresher&quot; safety checks and modifications.

After departing the Mediterranean on 16 May, &quot;Scorpion&quot; dropped two men at Naval Station Rota in Spain, one for a family emergency and one for health reasons. Some U.S. ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) operated from the U.S. Naval base Rota; USS &quot;Scorpion&quot; is thought to have provided noise cover for when they both departed to the Atlantic. Along with Soviet intelligence trawlers, Soviet fast nuclear attack submarines were attempting to detect and follow the U.S. submarines going out of Rota, in this case, two fast 32-knot Soviet hunter-killer subs.

&quot;Scorpion&quot; was then detailed to observe Soviet naval activities in the Atlantic in the vicinity of the Azores. An &quot;Echo II&quot;-class submarine was operating with this Soviet task force, as well as a Russian guided-missile destroyer. Having observed and listened to the Soviet units, &quot;Scorpion&quot; prepared to head back to Naval Station Norfolk.

== Disappearance: May 1968 ==
&quot;Scorpion&quot; attempted to send radio traffic to Naval Station Rota for an unusually long period beginning shortly before midnight on 20 May and ending after midnight on 21 May, but was only able to reach a Navy communications station in Nea Makri, Greece, which forwarded the messages to COMSUBLANT. Lt. John Roberts was handed Commander Slattery&#x27;s last message that he was closing on the Soviet submarine and research group, running at a steady at a depth of &quot;to begin surveillance of the Soviets.&quot; &quot;Scorpion &quot;was expected to arrive at her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, on 27 May at 1300 local time. After she was overdue for several hours, the Atlantic fleet launched a sea and air search during the peak search period from 28 to 30 May involving as many as 55 ships and 35 search aircraft. A brief radio message including &quot;Scorpion&#x27;s&quot; codename &quot;Brandywine&quot; was received by several search parties on the evening of 29 May. The source could not be identified in the search area derived from the bearings of the radio message.

=== Search: 1968 ===
The Navy suspected possible failure and launched a search, but &quot;Scorpion&quot; and her crew were declared &quot;presumed lost&quot; on 5 June. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 June. The search continued with a team of mathematical consultants led by John Piña Craven, the chief scientist of the Navy&#x27;s Special Projects Division. They employed the methods of Bayesian search theory, initially developed during the search for a hydrogen bomb lost off the coast of Palomares, Spain, in January 1966 in the Palomares B-52 crash.

Some reports indicate that a large and secret search was launched three days before &quot;Scorpion&quot; was expected back from patrol. This and other declassified information led to speculation that the Navy knew of &quot;Scorpion&quot;″s destruction before the public search was launched.

At the end of October 1968, the Navy&#x27;s oceanographic research ship located sections of the hull of &quot;Scorpion&quot; on the seabed, about southwest of the Azores under more than of water. This was after the Navy had released sound tapes from its underwater SOSUS listening system, which contained the sounds of the destruction of &quot;Scorpion&quot;. The court of inquiry was subsequently reconvened, and other vessels, including the bathyscaphe &quot;Trieste II&quot;, were dispatched to the scene to collect pictures and other data.

Craven received much credit for locating the wreckage of &quot;Scorpion&quot;, although Gordon Hamilton was instrumental in defining a compact &quot;search box&quot; wherein the wreck was ultimately found. He was an acoustics expert who pioneered the use of hydroacoustics to pinpoint Polaris missile splashdown locations, and he had established a listening station in the Canary Islands, which obtained a clear signal of the vessel&#x27;s pressure hull imploding as it passed crush depth. Naval Research Laboratory scientist Chester Buchanan used a towed camera sled of his own design aboard &quot;Mizar&quot; and finally located &quot;Scorpion&quot;.

=== Observed damage ===
The bow of &quot;Scorpion&quot; appears to have skidded upon impact with the globigerina ooze on the sea floor, digging a sizable trench. The sail had been dislodged, as the hull of the operations compartment upon which it perched disintegrated, and was lying on its port side. One of &quot;Scorpion&quot;″s running lights was in the open position, as if it had been on the surface at the time of the mishap, although it may have been left in the open position during the vessel&#x27;s recent nighttime stop at Rota. One &quot;Trieste II&quot; pilot who dived on &quot;Scorpion&quot; said that the shock of the implosion might have knocked the light into the open position.

The secondary Navy investigation – using extensive photographic, video, and eyewitness inspections of the wreckage in 1969 – suggested that &quot;Scorpion&quot;″s hull was crushed by implosion forces as it sank below crush depth. The Structural Analysis Group, which included Naval Ship Systems Command&#x27;s Submarine Structures director Peter Palermo, plainly saw that the torpedo room was intact, though it had been pinched by excessive sea pressure. The operations compartment collapsed at frame 33, this being the king frame of the hull, reaching its structural limit first. The conical/cylindrical transition piece at frame 67 followed instantly. The boat was broken in two by massive hydrostatic pressure at an estimated depth of . The operations compartment was largely obliterated by sea pressure, and the engine room had telescoped forward into the hull due to collapse pressure, when the cone-to-cylinder transition junction failed between the auxiliary machine space and the engine room.

The only damage to the torpedo room compartment appeared to be a hatch missing from the forward escape trunk. Palermo pointed out that this would have occurred when water pressure entered the torpedo room at the moment of implosion.

The sail was ripped off, as the hull beneath it folded inward. The propulsion shaft came out of the boat; the engineering section had collapsed inward in a telescoping fashion. The broken boat fell another to the ocean floor.

Photos taken in 1986 by &quot;Alvin,&quot; released by the Navy in 2012, show the broken inboard end of the propulsion shaft.


== Navy investigations ==

=== Court of inquiry report: 1968 ===
Shortly after her sinking, the Navy assembled a court of inquiry to investigate the incident and to publish a report regarding the likely causes for its loss. The court was presided over by Vice Admiral Bernard L. Austin, who had presided over the inquiry into the loss of . The report&#x27;s findings were first made public on 31 January 1969. While ruling out sabotage, the report said: &quot;The certain cause of the loss of the &quot;Scorpion&quot; cannot be ascertained from evidence now available.&quot;

In 1984, the &quot;Norfolk Virginian-Pilot&quot; and &quot;The Ledger-Star&quot; obtained documents related to the inquiry, and reported that the likely cause of the disaster was the detonation of a torpedo while the &quot;Scorpion&quot;″s own crew attempted to disarm it. The U.S. Navy declassified many of the inquiry&#x27;s documents in 1993.

=== Naval Ordnance Laboratory report: 1970 ===
An extensive, year-long analysis of Gordon Hamilton&#x27;s hydroacoustic signals of the submarine&#x27;s demise was conducted by Robert Price, Ermine Christian, and Peter Sherman of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory (NOL). All three physicists were experts on undersea explosions, their sound signatures, and their destructive effects. Price was also an open critic of Craven. Their opinion, presented to the Navy as part of the phase II investigation, was that the death noises likely occurred at when the hull failed. Fragments then continued in a free fall for another . This appears to differ from conclusions drawn by Craven and Hamilton, who pursued an independent set of experiments as part of the same phase II probe, demonstrating that alternate interpretations of the hydroacoustic signals were possibly based on the submarine&#x27;s depth at the time it was stricken and other operational conditions.

The Structural Analysis Group (SAG) concluded that an explosive event was unlikely and was highly dismissive of Craven and Hamilton&#x27;s tests. The SAG physicists argued that the absence of a bubble pulse, which invariably occurs in an underwater explosion, is absolute evidence that no torpedo explosion occurred outside or inside the hull. Craven had attempted to prove that &quot;Scorpion&quot;″s hull could &quot;swallow&quot; the bubble pulse of a torpedo detonation by having Gordon Hamilton detonate small charges next to air-filled steel containers.

The 1970 Naval Ordnance Laboratory &quot;Letter&quot;, the acoustics study of &quot;Scorpion&quot; destruction sounds by Price and Christian, was a supporting study within the SAG report. In its conclusions and recommendations section, the NOL acoustic study states: &quot;The first SCORPION acoustic event was not caused by a large explosion, either internal or external to the hull. The probable depth of occurrence  ... and the spectral characteristics of the signal support this. In fact, it is very unlikely that any of the &quot;Scorpion&quot; acoustic events were caused by explosions.&quot;

The NOL based many of its findings on an extensive acoustic analysis of the torpedoing and sinking of the decommissioned submarine in the Pacific in early 1969, seeking to compare its acoustic signals to those generated by &quot;Scorpion&quot;. Price found the Navy&#x27;s scheduled sinking of &quot;Sterlet&quot; fortunate. Nonetheless, &quot;Sterlet&quot; was a small World War II-era diesel-electric submarine of a vastly different design and construction from &quot;Scorpion&quot; with regard to its pressure hull and other characteristics. Its sinking resulted in three identifiable acoustic signals, as compared to &quot;Scorpion&quot;″s 15.

The NOL acoustics study provided a highly debated explanation as to how &quot;Scorpion&quot; may have reached its crush depth by anecdotally referring to the near-loss incident of the diesel submarine in January 1969, when a power problem caused her to sink almost to crush depth, before surfacing.

In the same May 2003 N77 letter excerpted above (see 1. with regard to the Navy&#x27;s view of a forward explosion), however, the following statement appears to dismiss the NOL theory, and again unequivocally point the finger toward an explosion forward:

=== Wreck site ===

The remains of the &quot;Scorpion&quot; are reportedly resting on a sandy seabed at in the North Atlantic Ocean. The wreck lies at a depth of about southwest of the Azores on the eastern edge of the Sargasso Sea.

The U.S. Navy periodically revisits the site to determine whether wreckage has been disturbed and to test for the release of any fissile materials from the submarine&#x27;s nuclear reactor or two nuclear weapons. Except for a few photographs taken by deep-water submersibles in 1968 and 1985, the U.S. Navy has never made public any physical surveys it has conducted on the wreck. The last photos were taken by Robert Ballard and a team of oceanographers from Woods Hole using the submersible Alvin in 1985. The U.S. Navy secretly lent Ballard the submersible to visit the wreck sites of the &quot;Thresher&quot; and &quot;Scorpion&quot;. In exchange for his work, the U.S. Navy then allowed Ballard, a USNR officer, to use the same submersible to search for .

Due to the radioactive nature of the &quot;Scorpion&quot; wreck site, the U.S. Navy has had to publish what specific environmental sampling it has done of the sediment, water, and marine life around the sunken submarine to establish what impact it has had on the deep-ocean environment. The information is contained within an annual public report on the U.S. Navy&#x27;s environmental monitoring for all U.S. nuclear-powered ships and boats. The reports explain the methodology for conducting deep-sea monitoring from both surface vessels and submersibles. These reports say the lack of radioactivity outside the wreck shows the nuclear fuel aboard the submarine remains intact and no uranium in excess of levels expected from the fallout from past atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons has been detected during naval inspections. Likewise, the two nuclear-tipped Mark 45 torpedoes that were lost when the &quot;Scorpion&quot; sank show no signs of instability. The plutonium and uranium cores of these weapons likely corroded to a heavy, insoluble material soon after the sinking. The materials remain at or close to their original location inside the boat&#x27;s torpedo room. If the corroded materials were released outside the submarine, their density and insolubility would cause them to settle into the sediment.

=== Call for inquiry: 2012 ===
In November 2012, the U.S. Submarine Veterans, an organization with over 13,800 members, asked the U.S. Navy to reopen the investigation on the sinking of USS &quot;Scorpion&quot;. The Navy rejected the request. A private group including family members of the lost submariners stated they would investigate the wreckage on their own, since it was located in international waters.

== Theories about the loss ==
=== Hydrogen explosion during battery charge ===
Retired acoustics expert Bruce Rule, a long-time analyst for the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS), wrote that a hydrogen explosion sank &quot;Scorpion.&quot;

Dave Oliver, a retired rear admiral who served in both diesel boats and nuclear submarines, wrote in his book &quot;Against the Tide&quot; that &quot;Scorpion&quot; was lost as a result of hydrogen build-up due to changes in the ventilation lineup while proceeding to periscope depth. After analysis of the ship&#x27;s battery cells, this is the leading theory for the loss of &quot;Scorpion.&quot; This is consistent with two small explosions aboard the submarine, a half-second apart, that were picked up by hydrophones.

=== Accidental activation of torpedo ===
The classified version of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s court of inquiry&#x27;s report, released in 1993, listed accidents involving the Mark 37 torpedo as three of the most probable causes for the loss of submarine, including a hot-running torpedo, an accidentally or deliberately launched weapon, or the inadvertent activation of a torpedo by stray voltage. The acoustic homing torpedo, in a fully ready condition and lacking a propeller guard, is theorized by some to have started running within the tube. Released from the tube, the torpedo then somehow became fully armed and engaged its nearest target: &quot;Scorpion&quot; herself.

=== Explosion of torpedo inside sub ===
A later theory was that a fire in the torpedo room had caused a torpedo to explode in the tube. The book &quot;Blind Man&#x27;s Bluff&quot; documents findings and investigation by John Craven, who was the chief scientist of the Navy&#x27;s Special Projects Office, which had management responsibility for the design, development, construction, operational test and evaluation, and maintenance of the UGM-27 Polaris fleet missile system. Craven surmised that a faulty battery had overheated. The Mark 46 silver–zinc battery used in the Mark 37 torpedo had a tendency to overheat, and in extreme cases could cause a fire that was strong enough to cause a low-order detonation of the warhead. If such a detonation had occurred, it might have opened the boat&#x27;s large torpedo-loading hatch and caused &quot;Scorpion&quot; to flood and sink. However, while Mark 46 batteries have been known to generate so much heat that the torpedo casings blistered, none are known to have damaged a boat or caused an explosion.

Craven mentions that he did not work on the Mark 37 torpedo&#x27;s propulsion system and became aware of the possibility of a battery explosion only 20 years after the loss of &quot;Scorpion&quot;. In his book &quot;The Silent War&quot;, he recounts a simulation run by former &quot;Scorpion&quot; executive officer Lieutenant Commander Robert Fountain Jr. Fountain was told he was headed home at 18 knots (33 km/h) at a depth of his choice, then there was an alarm of &quot;hot-running torpedo&quot;. Fountain responded with &quot;right full rudder&quot;, a quick turn that would activate a safety device and keep the torpedo from arming. Then, an explosion in the torpedo room was introduced. Fountain ordered emergency procedures to surface the boat, Craven wrote, &quot;but instead, she continued to plummet, reaching collapse depth and imploding in 90 seconds – one second shy of the acoustic record of the actual event.&quot;

Craven had long believed &quot;Scorpion&quot; was struck by her own torpedo, but revised his views during the mid-1990s, when he learned that engineers testing Mark 46 batteries at Keyport, Washington, just before the &quot;Scorpion&#x27;s&quot; loss, said the batteries leaked electrolyte and sometimes burned while outside their casings during lifetime shock, heat, and cold testing. Although the battery manufacturer was accused of building bad batteries, it was later able to successfully prove its batteries were no more prone to failure than those made by other manufacturers.

=== Intentional firing of defective torpedo ===
Twenty years later, Craven learned that the boat could have been destroyed by a &quot;hot-running torpedo.&quot; Other subs in the fleet had replaced their defective torpedo batteries, but the Navy wanted &quot;Scorpion&quot; to complete its mission first. If &quot;Scorpion&quot; had fired a defective torpedo, it could have sought out a target and turned back to strike the sub that launched it.

=== Structural damage ===
Photographs of the &quot;Scorpion&quot; wreck show the submarine&#x27;s detached shaft and propeller, missing a rotor blade. Some experienced U.S. submariners attribute the loss of the submarine to flooding caused by the detached shaft. Given that antisubmarine torpedoes were designed to seek the sound of the cavitation of the target submarine&#x27;s propeller, this could be damage caused by such a weapon.

=== Malfunction of trash disposal unit ===
During the 1968 inquiry, Vice Admiral Arnold F. Shade testified that he believed that a malfunction of the trash disposal unit (TDU) caused the disaster. Shade theorized that the boat was flooded when the TDU was operated at periscope depth and that other subsequent failures of material or personnel while dealing with the TDU-induced flooding led to the submarine&#x27;s demise.

=== Soviet attack ===
The book &quot;All Hands Down&quot; by Kenneth Sewell and Jerome Preisler (Simon and Schuster, 2008) concludes that &quot;Scorpion&quot; was destroyed while en route to gather intelligence on a Soviet naval group conducting operations in the Atlantic.

Ed Offley&#x27;s book &quot;Scorpion Down&quot; promotes a hypothesis suggesting that &quot;Scorpion&quot; was sunk by a Soviet submarine during a standoff that started days before 22 May. Offley also cites that it occurred roughly at the time of the submarine&#x27;s intelligence-gathering mission, for which she was redirected from her original heading for home. According to Offley, the Soviet flotilla had just been harassed by , another U.S. submarine. 

Both &quot;All Hands Down&quot; and &quot;Scorpion Down&quot; point toward involvement by the KGB spy ring led by John Anthony Walker Jr. in the heart of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s communications, stating that it could have known that &quot;Scorpion&quot; was coming to investigate the Soviet flotilla. According to this theory, both navies agreed to hide the truth about both USS &quot;Scorpion&quot; and K-129 incidents. Several USN and RN submarines collided with Soviet &quot;Echo&quot;-class subs in Russian and British waters in this period, showing greatly enhanced aggression in Soviet Navy sub operations in 1968. The navy Minister in the British Labour government noted 11 such deliberate collisions. Commander Roger Lane Nott, Royal Navy commander of during the 1982 Falklands War, stated that a Soviet submarine entered the Firth of Clyde channel in Scotland in 1972, and &quot;Conqueror&quot; was given the order to &quot;chase it out&quot;. The Soviets realized that they were being followed, and &quot;a very aggressive Soviet captain turned his submarine and drove her straight at HMS &quot;Conqueror&quot;. It had been an extremely close call.&quot;

According to a translated article from &quot;Pravda&quot;, Moscow never issued a &quot;fire&quot; command during the Cold War. This is disputed by Royal Navy officers: &quot;there had been other occasions when harassed Russians had fired torpedoes to scare off trails&quot;.

=== U.S. Navy conclusions ===
The results of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s various investigations into the loss of &quot;Scorpion&quot; are inconclusive. While the court of inquiry never endorsed Craven&#x27;s torpedo theory regarding the loss of &quot;Scorpion&quot;, its &quot;findings of facts&quot; released in 1993 carried Craven&#x27;s torpedo theory at the head of a list of possible causes of &quot;Scorpion&quot;″s loss.

=== &quot;Blind Man&#x27;s Bluff&quot; ===
In 1998, two &quot;New York Times&quot; reporters published &quot;Blind Man&#x27;s Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage&quot; discussing espionage during the Cold War. One lengthy chapter deals extensively with &quot;Scorpion&quot; and her loss. The authors report that concerns were raised in 1967 and 1968 about the Mk 37 torpedo carried aboard &quot;Scorpion&quot;—before &quot;Scorpion&quot; left Norfolk for her last mission. The concerns focused on the battery that powered the torpedoes. The battery had a thin metal-foil barrier separating two types of volatile chemicals. The chemicals generated heat and electricity when mixed slowly and in controlled conditions, powering the motor that pushed the torpedo through the water; but vibrations normally experienced on a nuclear submarine were found to cause the thin foil barrier to break down, allowing the chemicals to interact intensely. This interaction generated excessive heat, which could have caused an inadvertent torpedo explosion. The authors highlight information discovered during the investigation which contradicts the investigation&#x27;s findings. They cite a hot-running torpedo incident on the USS &quot;Sargo&quot; (SSN-583) prior to the loss of &quot;Scorpion&quot;, although &quot;Sargo&quot; was moored at the time and not lost.

=== &quot;Red Star Rogue&quot; ===
In 2005, the book &quot;Red Star Rogue: The Untold Story of a Soviet Submarine&#x27;s Nuclear Strike Attempt on the U.S.&quot;, by former American submariner Kenneth Sewell in collaboration with journalist Clint Richmond, claimed that Soviet submarine was sunk northwest of Oahu on 7 March 1968 while attempting to launch her three ballistic missiles, in a rogue attempt to destroy Pearl Harbor.

Sewell claims that the sinking of &quot;Scorpion&quot; was caused by a retaliatory strike for the sinking of &quot;K-129&quot;, which the Soviets had attributed to a collision with .

In 1995, when Peter Huchthausen began work on a book about the Soviet underwater fleet, he interviewed former Soviet Admiral Victor Dygalo, who stated that the true history of &quot;K-129&quot; has not been revealed because of the informal agreement between the two countries&#x27; senior naval commands. The purpose of that secrecy, he alleged, is to stop any further research into the losses of either &quot;Scorpion&quot; or &quot;K-129&quot;. Huchthausen states that Dygalo told him to &quot;forget about ever resolving these sad issues for the surviving families.&quot;

=== &quot;All Hands Down&quot; ===
&quot;All Hands Down&quot; was written by Kenneth R. Sewell, a nuclear engineer and a U.S. Navy veteran who spent five years aboard , a fast attack submarine. It attempts to link the sinking of &quot;Scorpion&quot; with the &quot;Pueblo&quot; incident, the John Anthony Walker spy ring, and Cold War Soviet aggression. The thesis of this book is that action off the Canary Islands was the direct cause of the sinking. The author purports that this is supported by motives in the Soviet Navy following the sinking of &quot;K-129&quot;, which caused the Russian Navy to trap a U.S. submarine. The bait for this trap would be strange military operations and furtive naval manoeuvres in the Atlantic, accompanied by countermeasures that would seemingly be defeated only by the deployment of a nuclear submarine. With information from spying by Walker, the position and arrival time of &quot;Scorpion&quot; was known by the Russians, and its sinking followed the springing of the trap. The book claims &quot;Scorpion&quot; was sunk by a Ka-25 helicopter equipped with antisubmarine torpedoes, which took off from one ship and landed on a different one. This was so that no one, other than the aircrew of the helicopter, would notice one torpedo missing.

The book then purports a cover-up by American and Soviet officials, to avoid public outrage and an increase in Cold War tension.

=== &quot;Scorpion Down&quot; ===
Ed Offley, a reporter on military affairs, has closely followed developments in information concerning the sinking of the &quot;Scorpion&quot;. His most recent article on the subject is &quot;Buried at Sea&quot; published in the Winter 2008 issue of the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Military History&quot;. This article summarizes the facts in the case as presented in his 2007 book &quot;Scorpion Down: Sunk by the Soviets, Buried by the Pentagon: The Untold Story of the USS Scorpion&quot;. In the book, Offley, gathering decades of his own research, hypothesizes that &quot;Scorpion&quot; was sunk by the Soviets, possibly in retaliation for the loss of &quot;K-129&quot; earlier that year. The book paints a picture of increasing Soviet anger at U.S. Navy provocations — specifically, close-in monitoring of Soviet naval operations by almost every U.S. nuclear submarine. Around the same time, the Soviet intelligence community scored a huge boon in receiving the mechanical cryptologic devices (TSAC/KW- 7) from . These machines, combined with daily crypto keys from the Walker spy ring, likely allowed the Soviets to monitor U.S. Navy ship dispositions and communications.

Offley contends that the &quot;Scorpion&quot; was tracked by several Soviet Navy assets from the Mediterranean to its final operational area south of the Azores, where it was then sunk by a Soviet torpedo. He claims the U.S. Navy was aware of the loss of the &quot;Scorpion&quot; on 21 May 1968, and by the night of 22 May 68, deep concern had arisen over the &quot;Scorpion&quot; after not receiving the required 24-hr, four-word communication check required on operational duty, in the SUBCOMLANT communication center at Norfolk on the evidence of two 2nd-class radiomen on the deck that night, among junior USN officers, and the unit supervisor, Warrant Officer J. Walker, confirmed to interested staff that no check transmission from &quot;Scorpion&quot; was received that night, and by the morning of 23 May 1968, the SUBCOMLANT center was full of admirals and a Marine general, and no doubt interested about the loss of &quot;Scorpion&quot;, and the US government and Navy were engaged in a massive cover-up, within days destroying much of the sound and communication data at SOSUS ground stations in the U.S. and Europe, and delaying any public indication of the loss until the ship&#x27;s scheduled arrival at Norfolk, Virginia, five days later, partly to disguise the fact that U.S. nuclear subs were in constant or frequent communication with U.S. naval communication bases and that the subsequent search for the &quot;Scorpion&quot; was a five-month-long deception to pretend they had no idea of the hull&#x27;s location.

The oral testimony Offley relied upon are recollections of surviving SOSUS recordings documenting torpedo sounds, evasion sounds, an explosion, and eventually the sounds of implosions as &quot;Scorpion&quot; plunged past crush depth.

=== &quot;Against the Tide: Rickover&#x27;s Leadership Principles and the Rise of the Nuclear Navy&quot; ===
In a section from this 2014 book titled &quot;The Danger of Culture&quot;, retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Dave Oliver offers the theory based on his own experiences that a hydrogen explosion, either during or immediately following a battery charge, possibly destroyed USS &quot;Scorpion&quot; and killed her crew. The proximate cause in that scenario would have been the procedural carryover from diesel-boat days wherein the boat was effectively rigged for collision—with subsequent changes in ventilation flow and watertight condition—before proceeding to periscope depth by way of setting &quot;Condition Baker&quot;. Oliver had personally witnessed dangerously high hydrogen level spikes under such conditions aboard a nuclear submarine, specifically while going to periscope depth and setting Condition Baker during a battery charge. Diesel boats, in contrast, were not capable of doing a battery charge while deeply submerged, but were instead dealing with the risk of collision while on antisurface-ship operations when proceeding to periscope depth while in or near shipping lanes. In regard to NAVSEA responsibility, he further states: &quot;I always felt that the investigators closed their eyes to the most likely cause because they did not want to acknowledge their own involvement in this tragedy. I had forwarded my letter about Condition Baker via some of the same people responsible for the &quot;Scorpion&quot; investigation.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
Phil Ochs released a song on his album &quot;Rehearsals for Retirement&quot; (1969) titled &quot;The Scorpion Departs but Never Returns&quot;.

Before its destruction, USS Scorpion was also featured in the 1957 apocalyptic novel On the Beach as one of the last surviving US Navy submarines after a global thermonuclear war.

<text>USS &quot;Scorpion&quot; (SS-278) – a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine – was the fifth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the scorpion.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Scorpion&quot;′s keel was laid down at the Portsmouth Navy Yard at Kittery, Maine, on 20 March 1942. She was launched on 20 July 1942, sponsored by Ms. Elizabeth T. Monagle, and commissioned on 1 October 1942.

==Service history==
Following further yard work and fitting out, &quot;Scorpion&quot; conducted shakedown operations off the southern New England coast in January 1943 and sailed for Panama in late February. In mid-March she transited the Panama Canal and headed toward Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. On an unrecorded date while she was on the surface at about the midpoint of her voyage from the Panama Canal Zone to Pearl Harbor, she encountered an Allied merchant ship which mistook her for a Japanese submarine and opened gunfire on her despite her efforts to identify herself. The merchant ship&#x27;s shells landed wide of &quot;Scorpion&quot;, and she proceeded with no damage or casualties. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 24 March 1943. There she underwent modifications which included the installation of a bathythermograph, a then-new oceanographic instrument to enable her to locate and hide in thermal layers that minimized the effectiveness of sonar equipment.

On 5 April, &quot;Scorpion&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for her first war patrol, a hunting and mining mission off the east coast of Honshū. On 19 April, she reached the mining area near Nakaminato. During the afternoon she reconnoitered the coast and in the evening she laid her naval mines, then retired to deep water. On 20 April, she sank her first enemy ship – a converted gunboat, &quot;Meiji Maru&quot; No.1. On 21 April, prior to 01:00, she fired on and destroyed her first sampan in surface action, then moved up the coast to observe the fishing grounds, shipping lanes, and coastline of the Shioya Saki area. On the night of 22 April, she destroyed three more sampans with gunfire and continued north toward Kinkasan To.

With the absence of shipping along the coastal lanes, she moved seaward and on 27 April sighted a convoy of four freighters escorted by a destroyer. At 04:59, she launched four torpedoes at the first and largest merchantman; two at the second; then dived and rigged for depth charging. At 05:05, the destroyer dropped her first depth charges. A half-hour later, the Japanese warship broke off her search for &quot;Scorpion&quot; to aid the stricken passenger-cargo ship. While &quot;Scorpion&quot; escaped with slight damage, the merchant vessel &quot;Yuzan Maru&quot; sank.

On 28 April, &quot;Scorpion&quot; received orders home. &quot;En route&quot; on 29 April, she sighted and engaged a patrol vessel, which she left burning to the waterline. On the morning of 30 April she stalked, fired on, and finally torpedoed and sank a patrol ship &quot;Ebisu Maru&quot; No.5. During the 105-minute fight, however, &quot;Scorpion&quot; received her first casualty. Lt. Cdr. R. M. Raymond – on board as prospective commanding officer – was hit and killed by gunfire.

Soon after the patrol vessel went down, an enemy plane appeared. &quot;Scorpion&quot; submerged, survived the plane&#x27;s depth charges and continued toward Midway Atoll and Pearl Harbor, arriving on 8 May.

With a /50 gun in place of her /50 gun, &quot;Scorpion&quot; set out on her second war patrol on 29 May. On 2 June, she refueled at Midway, and on 21 June she arrived off Takara Jima in the Tokara Gunto. For the next week, she searched for targets in that archipelago in an effort to disrupt shipping on the Formosa-Nagasaki routes. On 28 June, she shifted her hunt to the Yellow Sea and, by 30 June, was off the Shantung Peninsula. On 3 July, she sighted a five-freighter convoy with one escort making its way through the eastern waters of that sea. By 09:55, she had sent torpedoes toward the convoy and dived. As the depth charging began, she struck bottom at . Two charges exploded close by. Between 10:02 and 10:06, five more shook her hull. Fearing that she was stirring up a mud trail, the commander ordered her screws stopped and she settled on the bottom at . At 10:08, a chain or cable was dragged over her hull. Four minutes later, her hull was scraped a second time. Immediately underway again, she began evasive course changes and escaped further exploding charges. The hunt continued for over an hour; and at 11:49, &quot;Scorpion&quot; came to periscope depth; spied the destroyer off; and cleared the area. Postwar examination of Japanese records show that &quot;Scorpion&quot; scored five hits, and sank a freighter – the &quot;Anzan Maru&quot; – and a passenger-cargo ship – the &quot;Kokuryu Maru&quot;.

Because of damage received during the depth charging, &quot;Scorpion&quot; retraced her route through Tokara Gunto; underwent a bomber attack east of Akuseki Jima; and continued on to Midway. On 26 July, she arrived back at Pearl Harbor, underwent repairs, conducted training exercises, and, on 13 October, departed Pearl Harbor for her third war patrol. After touching at Midway on 17 October, she headed for the Mariana Islands, where she reconnoitered Pagan Island and Agrihan Island on 25–26 October, and Farallon de Pajoras on 1–2 November. On the last date, she struck an uncharted pinnacle; but suffering no apparent damage, continued her patrol. On 3 November, she was off Maug; and, two days later, she sighted her first target, a &quot;Mogami&quot;-class heavy cruiser. Squalls interfered, however, and she abandoned the target after a four-hour chase. On 7 November, she was back off Agrihan; and on 8 November, she closed with a freighter, which turned and gave chase. The freighter was a Q-ship, a warship disguised as a merchantman. Unable to regain the advantage, &quot;Scorpion&quot; retired.

Poor weather continued to plague the submarine&#x27;s hunting until, on 13 November, she sighted a freighter and a tanker escorted by three warships. Firing her torpedoes, she scored on the oiler, which went dead in the water; the &quot;Shiretoko&quot; was damaged. One of the escorts dropped depth charges, then rejoined the formation. On 14 November, &quot;Scorpion&quot; patrolled near Rota; and, on 15 November, she watched for targets off Saipan.

For the next week, the submarine continued to work the shipping lanes of the Marianas without success. Heavy seas and squalls continued to shelter enemy traffic. On 22 November, she sighted a transport accompanied by two destroyers and a corvette. She stalked the formation for 16 hours but was unable to fire. A few hours later, low on fuel, she headed home.

Departing Pearl Harbor on 29 December, &quot;Scorpion&quot; stopped at Midway to top off with fuel, and left that place on 3 January 1944 to conduct her fourth war patrol. Her assigned area was in the northern East China Sea and Yellow Sea. Her last commander was Lt. Cdr. Maximilian Gmelich Schmidt.

On the morning of 5 January, &quot;Scorpion&quot; reported that one of her crew members sustained a fractured foot via dropping a crate of oranges on it during the restocking of inventories in high seas. The &quot;Scorpion&quot; requested a rendezvous with which was returning from patrol and was near her. The rendezvous was accomplished on that afternoon. &quot;&quot;Scorpion&quot; reports case under control.&quot; &quot;Scorpion&quot; was never seen or heard from again after her departure from that rendezvous and reported &quot;sunk and lost at sea&quot;. On 16 February, and &quot;Scorpion&quot; were warned that they were close together, and that an enemy submarine was in the vicinity.

No Japanese information indicates that the loss of &quot;Scorpion&quot; was the result of an enemy anti-submarine attack. There were, however, several mine lines across the entrance to the Yellow Sea. The presence of these mine lines and the &quot;restricted area&quot; bounding them was discovered from captured Japanese Notices to Mariners at a much later date. In the meantime, several submarines had made patrols in this area, crossing and recrossing the mine lines without incident, and coming safely home. It is probable that these mine lines were very thin, offering only about a 10% threat to submarines at maximum, and steadily decreasing in effectiveness with the passage of time. &quot;Scorpion&quot; was lost soon after these mines were laid, at a time when they were the greatest threat. She could have been an operational casualty, but her area consisted of water shallow enough so that it might be expected that some men would have survived. Since there are no known survivors, the most reasonable assumption is that she hit a mine.

<text>Yettel Hungary (formerly &quot;Telenor&quot;, &quot;Pannon&quot; and &quot;Pannon GSM&quot;) is the second largest mobile phone operator in Hungary. Yettel Hungary Ltd. was founded as &quot;Pannon GSM Telecommunications Ltd.&quot; in 1994.

==History==

In November, 1993 Pannon GSM Telecommunications Ltd. signed a concession agreement and in March of the following year started to operate on the 900 MHz frequency. In 1999 the company won a tender for the 1800 MHz frequency. In November, 2000 it started to operate on the 1800 MHz frequency in Budapest, and in March 2001, the whole country.

The network covers 99% of Hungary. The company has 13 switching centres, more than 1500 base stations and employs 1,060 people. The company&#x27;s revenue in 2001 was HUF 132.8 billion and profits before taxes were HUF 18.7 billion.

On January 31, 2003 the company had 2,627,000 subscribers representing 40% of the Hungarian mobile market, which was then shared by 3 companies.
On February 14, 2006 the company changed its main brand to Pannon and refreshed its visual image, in line with the new corporate identity of its parent, Telenor. On May 18, 2010 the company changed its name to Telenor.

In 2009, the fairness of Pannon&#x27;s consumer contract terms was challenged in the Hungarian courts. A reference was made to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling concerning the role of EU member states&#x27; national courts in dealing with such challenges, which reinforced the ruling that the courts must examine potentially unfair terms and not apply them if they were found to be unfair, except where the consumer is opposed to that non-application. Whether the terms were actually unfair was referred back to the Hungarian court for resolution.

In January 2018, the company&#x27;s management confirmed media reports that there is interest in sale of Telenor&#x27;s business in southeastern Europe, including Telenor Hungary. In March 2018, Telenor sold its business in southeastern Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, Montenegro and Serbia) to the investment fund PPF, for a sum of 2.8 billion euros. 

In January 2022, Telenor announced they would change their name to Yettel on March 1, 2022.

<text>USS &quot;Seadragon&quot; (SS-194), a &quot;Sargo&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the leafy seadragon.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Seadragon&quot;′s keel was laid on 18 April 1938 by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut. She was christened and launched on 21 April 1939, sponsored by Mrs. May F. Richardson, wife of Admiral James O. Richardson, Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, and commissioned on 23 October 1939.

==Operational history==
Following a shakedown cruise off the United States East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea, &quot;Seadragon&quot; returned to New England and, on 23 May 1940, departed New London, Connecticut, for the Philippine Islands. With Commander, Submarine Division 17 (ComSubDiv 17) embarked, she arrived at Cavite on 30 November and commenced training operations as a unit of the Asiatic Fleet. A year later, she prepared for overhaul; and, by 8 December 1941 (7 December east of the International Date Line), she had started her yard period at the Cavite Navy Yard.

Two days later, on 10 December, she and sister ship , moored together, were caught in an enemy air raid against Cavite. &quot;Sealion&quot; took a direct hit which demolished her and damaged &quot;Seadragon&quot;. The force of the explosion ripped off part of the latter&#x27;s bridge. Fragments and splinters punctured her ballast tanks and conning tower, killing one and wounding five. The heat of the explosion scorched her hull and blistered her black paint.

Fires and explosions raged along the wharf. A nearby torpedo shop went up and flames reached toward a lighter, loaded with torpedoes, lying alongside &quot;Seadragon&quot;. Submarine Rescue Vessel , however, disregarded the danger and moved in to tow &quot;Seadragon&quot; into the channel; she continued into Manila Bay under her own power.

Temporary repairs were accomplished by tender and &quot;Pigeon&quot;; and, on the night of 15 December, &quot;Seadragon&quot; embarked members of the Asiatic Fleet staff. At 00:00, 16 December, she headed out of Manila Bay.

Escorted by destroyer , &quot;Seadragon&quot; moved south, &quot;via&quot; Surigao and Makassar Straits to Soerabaja, where she disembarked her passengers; received further repairs, exclusive of a paint job; and prepared for her first war patrol.

=== First patrol, December 1941 – February 1942 ===

On 30 December, the submarine departed the Dutch naval base and set a course for the South China Sea to intercept Japanese shipping off the coast of Indochina. On 8 January, she was in the sea lanes to Cam Ranh Bay. Two days later, she sighted a destroyer, launched two torpedoes which missed, then watched as the destroyer continued on its course without attempting to attack the submarine. &quot;Seadragon&quot; remained in the area. Shortly after noon, a convoy was heard. One-half-hour later, it was sighted, and the submarine began closing the last ship in the column. Shortly after 13:00, she fired; missed; and again tried to close to firing position. Within an hour, however, the convoy was safely into Cam Ranh Bay. &quot;Seadragon&quot; retired eastward. After dark while on the surface, recharging, she sighted a destroyer and attempted to slip away undetected. The destroyer spotlighted her. &quot;Seadragon&quot; went deep and worked her way eastward through two depth charge attacks.

She spent the morning of 12 January evading Japanese patrol planes. In the afternoon, she closed a six-ship convoy; but, as she came to periscope depth for a final check, she was spotted from the air. Three salvos of bombs dropped close aboard, but &quot;Seadragon&quot; went deep and again made her way eastward—this time to investigate the cause of the plane sightings. She surfaced after 18:00. No oil or air leaks were spotted, but her black paint was coming off the entire hull. Red lead undercoating showed from the waterline to the side plating, and, &quot;in spots&quot;, on the bow planes and propeller guards. In shallow tropical waters, her original black paint was easily spotted against a light colored background. With red showing, she stood out regardless of the color of the seabed. From then on, &quot;Seadragon&quot; ran at between periscope exposures except in areas known to be patrolled by air, when she went to .

On 14 January, she patrolled in the Cape Varella area. On 15 January, she shifted southward, and, on 16 January, she stood off Hon Lon to wait for a convoy. At 11:15, after a periscope observation, she was again spotted and bombed from the air. She returned to Cape Varella where the depth of the water permitted a closer patrol to the shore line.

During the next six days, she sighted several targets but had no luck with her torpedoes. Early on 23 January, she sighted a four-ship convoy which she stalked until daylight, then attacked. At 08:06, she fired at the lead ship and scored with a hit on the port quarter. She then fired two at the ship and missed. The third and fourth ships ran off to the southeast and west respectively. The second ship moved in toward the first; then, listing to port and down by the stern accompanied it as it ran for the beach. &quot;Seadragon&quot; surfaced and went after the third ship, but the appearance of an enemy plane forced her to break off the attack.

The submarine remained off the Indochina coast for another four days, then set a course back to Luzon. On 29 January, she began patrolling along the coast from Subic Bay to Lingayen Gulf. On 1 February, she took up station off San Fernando and, early on the morning of 2 February, conducted a night submerged attack on a five-ship convoy. &quot;Tamagawa Maru&quot; (a 6,441-ton transport), the fourth ship in line, went down, depriving the Japanese occupation force of a number of the reinforcement troops and the equipment she carried.

After the sinking, &quot;Seadragon&quot; patrolled southward. On 4 February, she arrived off Luzon Point; and, that night, she moved into Manila Bay. Mooring at 22:03, she completed loading torpedoes, radio equipment, and submarine spare parts at 03:00 on 5 February. Shortly thereafter, she moved out; rested on the bottom until after dark, then surfaced to take on twenty-five passengers at Corregidor. Among them were seventeen members of the crew at  (cryptanalysts and traffic analysts), including the commanding officer, Lieutenant Rudolph Fabian. At 19:46, &quot;Seadragon&quot; got underway for the Netherlands East Indies.

=== Second patrol, March – April 1942 ===

She arrived at Soerabaja on 13 February. On 21 February, she left for Tjilatjap, whence she was ordered on to Australia. She reached Fremantle on 4 March and two weeks later, again headed for the Indochina coast for her second war patrol. At the end of the month, she was diverted to Cebu to take on fuel and food for Corregidor. She unloaded ten torpedoes and 250 rounds of ammunition, and took on thirty tons of food. At 20:53 on 8 April, she moored alongside &quot;Pigeon&quot;, to which she transferred fuel; offloaded seven tons of food (of the thirty she had taken aboard just for the besieged defenders); took on 23 passengers (including the last seventeen members of the crew at , among them &quot;Honest John&quot; Leitweiler and Rufus Taylor, who as a Japanese language specialist was worth his weight in gold); and, at 21:29, got underway to resume her patrol.

She remained in the waters off southwestern Luzon and recommenced her patrol off the entrance to Subic Bay. On 11 April, she sighted several targets but was able to attack only one, a patrolling destroyer. At 17:20, she launched three torpedoes. Twenty-nine seconds later the first torpedo exploded halfway to the target. The second broached and circled abeam of the target. The destroyer avoided the third. &quot;Seadragon&quot; changed course and went to to avoid the circular and the expected depth charging. None of the depth charges were close, but a second destroyer soon joined the first, spotted the submarine as she came up for a periscope observation, and turned on her. &quot;Seadragon&quot; again went deep, then cleared the area.

On 12 April, the submarine started south. On 20 April, she cleared Lombok Strait; and, on 26 April, she returned to Fremantle.

=== Third patrol, June – August 1942 ===

On her third patrol, 11 June to 2 August 1942, &quot;Seadragon&quot; returned to the South China Sea. Arriving in her assigned area on 27 June, she patrolled along the Singapore-Hong Kong routes to the end of the month; then shifted to the Cape Varella area. On the morning of 4 July, she launched a torpedo at the leader of a three ship formation. The torpedo missed ahead, all three ships changed course toward &quot;Seadragon&quot; with the leader proceeding down the torpedo track firing her bow gun. Depth charges were dropped indiscriminately. Ten minutes later, the three had turned toward shore. &quot;Seadragon&quot; then shifted southward to intercept enemy traffic off Hon Lon Light.

A few hours later, she sighted two freighters and fired tubes 1 and 2 at the lead ship. Her No. 1 tube did not fire, and her No. 2 torpedo missed astern. Two more torpedoes were fired at the ships, but both missed. Enemy planes arrived on the scene soon afterward and for over two hours aerial depth charges in salvos of two and three were dropped. Despite water depth of , submarines were visible at any depth against the light colored bottom.

&quot;Seadragon&quot; survived the close bombing and continued her patrol. During the next week, she attempted to close several ships, but was unable to attain attack positions. On the night of 11 July, her losing streak ended. Just prior to midnight, she sighted smoke and opened out to the westward to overtake the target. At 01:56 on 12 July, she began her approach; and, 14 minutes later, she launched three torpedoes. Two hit, but the third missed astern. A merchantman, &quot;Hiyama Maru&quot;, began settling. By 02:19, she had been abandoned. &quot;Seadragon&quot; submerged and resumed her patrol eight miles (14.8 km) northeast of Cape Varella.

On the morning of 13 July, &quot;Seadragon&quot; torpedoed and sank her second victim of the patrol. &quot;Shinyo Maru&quot; was hit approximately abaft the beam and settled immediately. &quot;Seadragon&quot; moved out of the area and hunted along the Haina Varella routes for a few days. On 16 July, she was back off Cape Varella; and, soon after 10:30, she fired on a four-ship convoy. Five minutes later, the torpedoes exploded on the beach. The four ships turned toward &quot;Seadragon&quot; and commenced firing their guns. &quot;Seadragon&quot; fired two more torpedoes and went deep. A few minutes later, she came to periscope depth. Only three ships remained on the surface. &quot;Hakodate Maru&quot; had been sunk.

On 20 July, &quot;Seadragon&quot; departed the South China Sea and made her way south to Australia. On 4 August, she damaged the 6,816 ton at .

=== Fourth patrol, August – October 1942 ===

On 26 August, she departed her Australian base for her fourth war patrol and again set a course for the coast of Indochina. On 10 September, she moved through Apo East Pass. On 11 September, her progress into the South China Sea was delayed by an emergency appendectomy performed successfully on Seaman Darrell Rector by Pharmacist&#x27;s Mate Wheeler B. Lipes, the first such performed on a submarine. This incident was the subject of a Pulitzer Prize-winning account by &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; reporter George Weller. In 2005, retired Lt. Cmdr. Lipes was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal for saving a fellow crewman&#x27;s life.

On 12 September, &quot;Seadragon&quot; arrived on station and commenced patrolling the steamer lanes west of Macclesfield Bank. At dusk on 16 September, she headed for Cape Varella.

Not until 22 September, however, while off Cam Ranh Bay was she able to gain a firing position on a suitable target. On that morning, she launched four torpedoes at a cruiser escorted by two destroyers. No explosions were heard, but her torpedoes were seen, and the enemy ships turned on &quot;Seadragon&quot; and delivered a &quot;well executed depth charge attack.&quot;

A week later, on the night of 29 September, the submarine tracked a five-ship convoy; and, at 0122 on 30 September conducted a surface torpedo attack which damaged one ship. She then ran eastward to attain a position ahead of the convoy but was spotlighted by an escort which had shifted stations. &quot;Seadragon&quot; went deep; the escort dropped six depth charges and then rejoined the convoy. The submarine surfaced and attempted to make up for lost time. Three hours later, she had overheated her main motor cables and was forced to give up the chase.

On the evening of 3 October, &quot;Seadragon&quot; departed the South China Sea and, five days later, commenced patrolling the approaches to Balikpapan. On 10 October, she attained a position for a stern tube shot on &quot;Shigure Maru&quot;. The cargoman disappeared 47 seconds after the first explosion. On 11 October, the submarine patrolled off Cape William and Cape Mandar. On 12 October, she was off Makassar City. On 14 October, she transited Lombok Strait; and, on 20 October, she returned to Fremantle.

=== Fifth patrol, November 1942 – January 1943 ===

Refit was started by submarine tender at Fremantle and completed by tenders and at Brisbane. On 23 November, she departed the latter and headed for the Bismarck Archipelago for her fifth war patrol. On 29 November, she entered her area and commenced patrolling the Rabaul-Shortland routes. On 1 December, she closed the New Britain coast to intercept traffic to the Japanese beachhead at Buna, and, during the next ten days, conducted several unsuccessful approaches on enemy formations. On the morning of 11 December, she sighted a freighter with one escort rounding Cape St. George and launched two torpedoes at the merchantman. One hit under the main mast, damaging but not sinking the target. The escort delivered a depth charge attack then took the damaged vessel under tow for Rabaul. Enemy planes prohibited &quot;Seadragon&quot; from delivering the &quot;coup de grace&quot;.

On 21 December, &quot;Seadragon&quot; sighted an enemy submarine near Cape St. George, made her approach, and launched three torpedoes at the target. The first missed ahead. The second exploded about 18 seconds after firing. The third torpedo hit the target. sank with her bow vertical and with all hands lost. The second torpedo explosion, however, had damaged &quot;Seadragon&quot;. The force of the explosion had knocked down the personnel in the forward torpedo room, and the final bow torpedo in No. 1 tube, the outer door of which was open, was forced against the tail buffer. The countermining effect forced the torpedo forward shearing off the guide stud and tripping the starting lever. The outer door could not be closed. Depth control was lost. The final bow torpedo was fired. Control was regained as the torpedo exploded on &quot;Seadragon&quot;&#x27;s port quarter at an estimated 200 yards.

On 25 December, &quot;Seadragon&quot; damaged another cargoman, and, on 26 December, departed the area for Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 7 January 1943.

From Pearl Harbor, &quot;Seadragon&quot; continued on to the West Coast, where skipper &quot;Pete&quot; Ferrall was detached to the Bureau of Ships. Between 16 January and 8 April, she underwent overhaul at Mare Island, receiving new batteries and radar and changing the position of her three-inch mount from aft to a forward position. In mid-April, she sailed west again; and, on 9 May, she departed Pearl Harbor for her sixth war patrol.

=== Sixth patrol, May – June 1943 ===

On 15 May, &quot;Seadragon&quot; (now under Royal L. Rutter, Class of &#x27;30) crossed the 180th meridian and moved toward Micronesia. On 19 May, she commenced patrolling in the Caroline Islands. On 20 May, she surprised and was in turn surprised by sighting a surfaced submarine on a parallel course. The other submarine submerged immediately. On 22 May, she took up station off the Truk Islands and for the next 11 days patrolled the sea lanes to the major enemy anchorage enclosed by Dublon, Fefan, and Uman islands. On 4 June, she departed Truk and moved eastward to reconnoiter Ponape, thence proceeded into the Marshall Islands to patrol the sealanes converging on Kwajalein. There, the enemy&#x27;s omnipresent surface and aerial escorts inhibited hunting, but, on 13 June, &quot;Seadragon&quot; was able to damage a freighter. Four days later, she cleared the area, and, on 21 June, she arrived at Midway Island, whence she returned to Pearl Harbor for repairs to her steering gear.

=== Seventh–ninth patrols, July 1943 – February 1944 ===

From 18 July to 30 August, &quot;Seadragon&quot; conducted her seventh war patrol. Of the 44 days, 31 were spent on station near Wake and in the Marshall Islands where increased enemy air activity again hindered hunting and limited &quot;Seadragon&quot;&#x27;s score to five freighters damaged. In mid-August, she reconnoitered Wotje; and, at the end of the month, she returned to Pearl Harbor.

On her eighth war patrol, 24 September to 5 November, &quot;Seadragon&quot; again returned to the Marshall Islands and spent 31 days hunting in the sea lanes to Kwajalein. Again Japanese antisubmarine measures hindered hunting; and, of the five ship contacts made, only two could be developed and only one attack was made. On 13 October, she damaged an enemy transport.

&quot;Seadragon&quot;&#x27;s ninth war patrol, 14 December 1943 to 5 February 1944, took her back to the Caroline Islands where she hunted enemy shipping on the Truk-Saipan route and damaged two, possibly three, cargomen.

=== Tenth patrol, April – May 1944 ===

Refit brought the replacement of &quot;Seadragon&quot;&#x27;s three-inch deck gun with a four-inch gun, and, on 1 April, she cleared Pearl Harbor for the Japanese home islands for her tenth war patrol, with James H. Ashley, Jr. (Class of &#x27;34), at the helm. On 5 April, she crossed the International Date Line. On 15 April, she entered Japanese waters. On 16 April, she moved past O Shima, and, that night, commenced patrolling off the Bungo Strait and Kii Channel entrances to the Inland Sea. On the morning of 23 April, she sighted four freighters, escorted by three patrol boats, moving toward Shiono Misaki. She closed the convoy; fired on the third ship, the heaviest laden; then went deep and rigged for depth charging. The patrol boats moved toward &quot;Seadragon&quot; as &quot;Daiju Maru&quot; sank and, during the next two hours, delivered a 40 depth charge attack. Later that day, the submarine conducted an unsuccessful attack on a naval auxiliary; and, on 26 April, she moved out into the Tokyo-Manila shipping lanes where she damaged a freighter on 27 April.

On 28 April, she commenced patrolling the Nagoya-Saipan route. In May, she took station off the entrance to Sugura Wan and, on 3 May, shifted to the Tokyo-Guam-Saipan-Truk sea lanes. Two days later, she hunted enemy traffic at the entrance to Sagami Wan. On 13 May, she headed for Midway Island. On 17 May, she caught an armed trawler in a surface attack; set it afire with four-inch gun salvos, then closed the target to take off the uniformed enemy crew. The surviving crew members refused to surrender, and &quot;Seadragon&quot; continued eastward. On 21 May, she crossed the 180th meridian and stopped at Midway, then got underway for Pearl Harbor, arriving on 25 May.

=== Eleventh patrol, September – November 1944 ===

Re-engined at Mare Island during the summer, &quot;Seadragon&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 7 September and departed on her 11th war patrol, a coordinated patrol (&quot;wolfpack&quot;) with submarines and , on 23 September. She arrived at Saipan to top off on 3 October. On 4 October, &quot;Shark&quot; and &quot;Blackfish&quot; continued on to the wolfpack&#x27;s assigned area in the northern China Sea. &quot;Seadragon&quot;, delayed by the need for repairs, did not depart until 5 October. On 9 October, she arrived off Batan Island, established contact with &quot;Shark&quot; and &quot;Blackfish&quot;, and took position in a scouting line in the pack&#x27;s assigned area.

On the night of 21 October and the morning of 22 October, the group went after an enemy warship formation led by an aircraft carrier. At 06:15 on 24 October, &quot;Shark&quot; reported a contact, and &quot;Seadragon&quot; headed for the scene. At 07:30, the contact was sighted through the high periscope, but it proved too distant. At 09:20, &quot;Seadragon&quot; sighted three enemy merchantmen in a loose column with a torpedo boat destroyer and an airplane as escorts. At 10:55, she launched four torpedoes at the lead freighter.

The first torpedo broached and ran erratic, alerting the escort which started for &quot;Seadragon&quot;. &quot;Seadragon&quot; rigged for depth charging. Soon thereafter, two torpedo explosions were heard, and, at 11:01, the first of eight depth charges was dropped. At 11:54, &quot;Seadragon&quot; went to periscope depth. The escort was milling around picking up survivors four miles (6 km) astern. The remaining merchant ships were ahead of the submarine and making only two or three knots. As &quot;Seadragon&quot; prepared to fire again, the destroyer rejoined the formation. At 11:14, &quot;Seadragon&quot; fired four more torpedoes. Three hits were observed. The submarine&#x27;s second target of the day sank in less than two minutes.

&quot;Seadragon&quot; went deep. Fifteen depth charges followed. At 13:10, the submarine returned to periscope depth. The deck of the sole remaining freighter was crowded. The freighter was smoking heavily and moving slowly. The escort circled the freighter. At 14:04, &quot;Seadragon&quot; fired. The first torpedo tore off the freighter&#x27;s bow. The rest of the ship went under quickly. At 14:05, the first of 25 depth charges was dropped.

Postwar examination of Japanese records identified the sunken ships as the cargo ship, &quot;Eiko Maru&quot;, and the passenger-cargomen &quot;Taiten Maru&quot; and &quot;Kokuryu Maru&quot;.

At 18:58, &quot;Seadragon&quot; tried unsuccessfully to raise &quot;Shark&quot;. She had been sunk after attacking the contact of her 06:15 transmission.

On 26 October, &quot;Seadragon&quot; headed toward Luzon. On 27 and 28 October, she searched for downed aviators; and, on 29 October, she was ordered to return to Midway.

=== Twelfth patrol, December 1944 – January 1945 ===

Arriving at her destination on 8 November, she commenced refit; and, on 3 December, she headed west for her 12th war patrol. The patrol took her back into Japanese waters where she hunted enemy shipping and searched for downed aviators into January 1945. On 10 January, she moved into the Bonin Islands, where she continued those two roles. On 19 January, she set a southerly course; and, on 22 January, she arrived at Guam to complete her last war patrol.

The next day, &quot;Seadragon&quot; continued on to Pearl Harbor, and, after refit, returned to California to provide training services to naval air units. In May, she was transferred back to the Atlantic Fleet and for the final months of the war, provided training services at Guantanamo Bay and Key West, Florida. In September, she moved north to New London, Connecticut, thence to Boston, Massachusetts, where she was decommissioned on 15 November 1945. Less than four months later, on 8 February 1946, she was recommissioned to assist in the inactivation and preservation of submarines, including U-boats, at Hingham, Massachusetts. On 29 October 1946, she was again decommissioned and berthed as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet where she remained until stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 April 1948. &quot;Seadragon&quot; was sold for scrap in early July 1948.
