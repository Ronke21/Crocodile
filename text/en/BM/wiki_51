<text>A screen magnifier is software that interfaces with a computer&#x27;s graphical output to present enlarged screen content. By enlarging part (or all) of a screen, people with visual impairments can better see words and images. This type of assistive technology is useful for people with some functional vision; people with visual impairments and little or no functional vision usually use a screen reader.

==Use==
The simplest form of magnification presents an enlarged portion of the original screen content, the &#x27;focus&#x27;, so that it covers some or all of the full screen. This enlarged portion should include the content of interest to the user and the pointer or cursor, also suitably enlarged. As the user moves the pointer or cursor the screen magnifier should track with it and show the new enlarged portion. If this tracking is jerky or flickers it is likely to disturb the user. Also, the pointer or cursor may not be the content of interest: for example, if the user presses a keyboard shortcuts that opens a menu, the magnified portion should jump to that menu. Pop-up windows and changes in system status can also trigger this rapid shifting.

Screen magnifiers can be especially helpful for people with low vision, including elderly users. However, in a 2001 paper, Vicki Hanson noted that people with low vision often also have additional disabilities such as tremors.

==Features==
Ranges of 1- to 16-times magnification are common. The greater the magnification the smaller the proportion of the original screen content that can be viewed, so users will tend to use the lowest magnification they can manage.

Screen magnifiers commonly provide several other features for people with particular sight difficulties:
* Color inversion. Many people with visual impairments prefer to invert the colors, typically turning text from black-on-white to white-on-black. This can reduce screen glare and is useful for elderly people with age-related macular degeneration.
* Smoothing. Text can become blocky and harder to recognise when enlarged. Some screen magnifiers use interpolation to smooth the text to compensate.
* Cursor customisation. The mouse and text cursors can often be modified in several ways, such as circling it to help the user locate it on the screen.
* Different magnification modes. Screen magnifiers can alter how they present the enlarged portion: covering the full screen, providing a lens that is moved around the un-magnified screen, or using a fixed magnified portion.
* Crosshairs. Even with magnification, some users can find the mouse pointer hard to see. Crosshairs – especially when their size, color and opacity are customizable – can make the use of a pointing device easier.
* Screen reader. Some magnifiers come packaged with a basic screen reader, allowing whatever the user is pointing at to be read out.

==Screen magnifiers bundled with an operating system==
* Haiku includes an application called Magnify
* Linux-based operating systems:
** Compiz-Fusion window manager has a highly configurable plugin named &quot;Enhanced Zoom Desktop&quot;
** GNOME has gnome-mag, which forms part of GNOME Shell
** KDE has KMagnifier (KMag)
* The Microsoft Windows operating system has included the &quot;Magnifier&quot; application since Windows 98 (released in 1998). It can integrate with a mouse-button toggle.
* In OS X, the built-in screen magnification feature can be used at any time by using keyboard shortcuts or by scrolling with a mouse or trackpad. Screen magnification is built into iOS devices as well.

<text>Kankaanpää () is a town and municipality of Finland. Kankaanpää was founded in 1865, became a township in 1967 and finally a town in 1972. It is located in the crossroads of Hämeenkangas and Pohjankangas ridges. It belongs to the region of Satakunta. Kankaanpää has a population of about inhabitants, which make it the third largest municipality in the Satakunta region in terms of population, after the city of Pori and the town of Rauma. Pori is located southwest of Kankaanpää.

The coat of arms of Kankaanpää has its theme from the early days of the municipality&#x27;s settlement, the origin of which is depicted with a golden pine tree in the middle of forest areas. The coat of arms was designed by Carolus Lindberg and was confirmed on 12 October 1951.

Honkajoki municipality was merged with Kankaanpää on 1 January 2021.

==History==
First signs of humanity in the area are from the stone age and during the 16th century people started to settle in Kankaanpää area. Oldest houses that area found from the documents of Swedish Finland are from the 1560 decade. There were three houses in Kankaanpää then: Honko, Oukari and Päivike.

The oldest passage in the province was from Hämeenkyrö through the ridges to Kauhajoki. In the 17th century it was the most important road between southern Finland and Ostrobothnia. The king of Sweden visited Kankaanpää twice. Gustavus Adolphus travelled from Ilmajoki to Hämeenlinna through Kankaanpää in 1614 and Adolf Fredrik had a rest in Kuninkaanlähde spring to water his horses and to eat in 1752. The spring was named after this event.

== Climate ==
Based on the village of Niinisalo about 5.7 km northeast of the site the climate is a continental subarctic frontier (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;) considering that the warmest fourth month is around 9 °C, which puts Kankaanpää in a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) being closer to Helsinki than Oulu, it also means that summer is more consistent and warm but winters are still cold. The municipality is considered one of the rainiest of Finland with 571 mm only during a growing season in 1995. Growing season starts in early May and lasts until October 10.

<doc id="418550" wikidata="Q426099" url="?curid=418550" title="Siege of Antwerp (1914)">
<text>The siege of Antwerp (, , ) was an engagement between the German and the Belgian, British and French armies around the fortified city of Antwerp during the First World War. German troops besieged a garrison of Belgian fortress troops, the Belgian field army and the British Royal Naval Division in the Antwerp area, after the German invasion of Belgium in August 1914. The city, which was ringed by forts known as the National Redoubt, was besieged to the south and east by German forces.

The Belgian forces in Antwerp conducted three sorties in late September and early October, which interrupted German plans to send troops to France, where reinforcements were needed to counter the French armies and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). A German bombardment of the Belgian fortifications with heavy and super-heavy artillery began on 28 September. The Belgian garrison had no hope of victory without relief; despite the arrival of the Royal Naval Division beginning on 3 October, the Germans penetrated the outer ring of forts. When the German advance began to compress a corridor from the west of the city along the Dutch border to the coast, through which the Belgians at Antwerp had maintained contact with the rest of unoccupied Belgium, the Belgian Field Army commenced a withdrawal westwards towards the coast.

On 9 October, the remaining garrison surrendered, the Germans occupied the city and some British and Belgian troops escaped to the Netherlands further north to be interned for the duration of the war. Belgian troops from Antwerp withdrew to the Yser river, close to the French border and dug in, to begin the defence of the last unoccupied part of Belgium and fought the Battle of the Yser against the German 4th Army in October and November 1914. The Belgian Army held the area until late in 1918, when it participated in the Allied liberation of Belgium.

==Background==

===Strategic context===

The city of Antwerp (military governor general, Victor Deguise) was defended by numerous forts and other defensive positions and was considered to be impregnable. Since the 1880s, Belgian defence planning had been based on holding barrier forts on the Meuse (Maas) at Liège and at the confluence of the Meuse and the Sambre rivers at Namur, to prevent French or German armies from crossing the river, with the option of a retreat to the national redoubt at Antwerp, as a last resort, until the European powers guaranteeing Belgian neutrality could intervene. The national redoubt consisted of a dozen older forts around outside to the city, completed in the 1860s, with an &quot;enceinte&quot; around the town abutting the Scheldt estuary at either end, with wet ditches around the &quot;enceinte&quot; and forts. The principal line of resistance comprised a ring of outside the city, which had been built after 1882. A group of two forts and three coastal batteries defended the Scheldt and there were a small number of prepared inundations. Forts built at Liège and Namur on the Meuse were of similar construction and intended to be &quot;barrier forts and bridgeheads&quot;, a first line of defence in the event of an invasion from the east or south-east.

===German invasion===

On 2 August 1914, the Belgian government refused the passage of German troops through Belgium to France and on the night of the Belgian General Staff ordered the 3rd Division to Liège to obstruct a German advance. The German army invaded Belgium on the morning of 4 August. Covered by the 3rd Division, the Liège fortress garrison, a screen of the Cavalry Division and detachments from Liège and Namur, the rest of the Belgian Field Army closed up to the river Gete and by 4 August, the 1st Division had assembled at Tienen, the 5th Division at Perwez, the 2nd Division at Leuven and the 6th Division at Wavre, covering central and western Belgium and the communications towards Antwerp. German cavalry appeared at Visé early on 4 August and found the bridge down and Belgian troops on the west bank. The Germans found a ford, crossed the river and forced the Belgians to retire towards Liège. By the evening it was clear to the Belgian High Command that the 3rd Division and the Liège garrison were in the path of a very large invasion force.
On 5 August the Battle of Liège began, when the Germans tried to capture the fortified city of Liège by a and then attempted a night attack, which collapsed in confusion until General Erich Ludendorff rallied the infantry. Ludendorff attacked again around noon on 6 August and found no opposition in the city, the Belgian 3rd Division having been withdrawn to the Gete. The Germans began a siege of the fortress, which fell on 16 August. On 10 August German cavalry reached the Gete and &quot;Jägers&quot; began to move northwards to Diest and Hasselt. On 12 August German cavalry and attacked at the Battle of Halen and were driven off after a ten-hour battle. By 17 August, a huge number of German troops had crossed into Belgium between the Meuse, Demer and Gete, despite the demolitions carried out by the Belgian Army and paramilitary . The Belgian position on the right (southern) flank of the Gete, was threatened by a flanking manoeuvre through Huy. On 18 August the Germans attacked again, captured Halen, entered Tienen and attacked the 1st Division frontally and on the northern flank, which the 1st Division repulsed only with great difficulty.

With information that five German corps and six reserve corps were in Belgium and with no support from the French Army and British Expeditionary Force (BEF) ready, the Belgian Field Army was ordered to withdraw towards Antwerp on the evening of 18 August. It arrived on 20 August, with little interference from German advanced parties, except for an engagement between the 1st Division and the German IX Corps near Tienen, in which the Belgians had Brussels, the Belgian capital, was captured on 20 August, as the Belgian Field Army arrived at Antwerp. Namur fell on 24 August, at the same time that the field army made a sortie from Antwerp towards Brussels. The Belgian government of Charles de Broqueville left Brussels and moved to Antwerp to avoid capture by the Germans, who detached the III Reserve Corps from the First Army to mask the city from positions either side of the Dyle Canal. A brigade of the IV Reserve Corps was sent to occupy Brussels. The IX Reserve Corps was ordered to move to Antwerp on 22 August.

==Prelude==

===German plan of attack===
As part of the war planning conducted by Schlieffen and then Moltke between 1898 and 1914, a plan had been made to isolate Antwerp, to counter the possibility that Belgian forces reinforced by British troops, would threaten the northern flank of the German armies involved in the invasion of France. The plan anticipated operations by eleven divisions from seven reserve corps on the east of the National Redoubt, where inundations were impossible. In 1914 the siege was conducted by only six divisions, one of which was needed to guard the Liège–Brussels railway between Tienen and Brussels and the ground between Brussels and Antwerp. Beseler abandoned the pre-war plan and substituted an attack from south of Antwerp, towards forts Walem, Sint-Katelijne-Waver and then an exploitation northwards in the area of forts Koningshooikt, Lier, Kessel, four intermediate works, the river Nete and an inundation wide. The 6th and 5th reserve, marine and 4th &quot;Ersatz&quot; divisions forced Belgian outposts back on 28 September and formed a covering line from the Nete to the Scheldt at Mechelen. Behind the covering line, German siege artillery was installed to the east and south of Mechelen, ready to commence a bombardment on Forts Sint-Katelijne-Waver and Walem as the Dorpveld and Bosbeek redoubts, to the north-east of Sint-Katelijne-Waver were engaged by mortars and the field defences between the forts, the Nete bridges and Antwerp waterworks north of Walem were bombarded by other heavy guns.

===Belgian defensive preparations===
Work by Belgian engineers to construct field defences around Antwerp had gone on since the beginning of the war, building positions in the intervals between the forts, inundations formed and the foreground cleared of obstructions. The clearances proved unwise, since they made the forts visible, trenches could only be dug deep, because of the high water-table and had no overhead cover. During the German advance to Mechelen, most of the Belgian Army occupied the 4th Sector between the 3rd Sector and the Scheldt, only light forces held the 3rd Sector and the 4th Division held the sector around Dendermonde. The 1st and 2nd divisions were sent to the 3rd Sector and the 5th Division took up reserve positions behind them.

==Siege==

===First sortie, 24–26 August===
The Belgian Army made a first sortie from Antwerp to help French and British troops engaged in fighting at the Sambre and at the Mons Canal. The operation was intended to distract the III Reserve and IX Reserve corps observing Antwerp and to cut German communications through Leuven and Brussels. After reconnaissance on 24 August, four divisions advanced southwards from Mechelen the next day, leaving one division of infantry and the Cavalry Division in reserve. The sortie was halted on 26 August, after receiving news of the withdrawal of the French and British and that Joseph Joffre, commander of the French army, did not intend to attack immediately and the Belgian forces returned to Antwerp.

On the night of the city was bombed by a German Zeppelin airship. Ten Belgian civilians were killed but the bombing failed to undermine the morale of the garrison. By 27 August reports to OHL led Moltke to believe that the Belgian army had lost its offensive capacity and ordered the brigade of the IV Reserve Corps at Brussels, to move south to rejoin the corps at Péronne. On 2 September German intelligence sources in Brussels reported that troops had landed at Ostend, occupied the coast westwards to Boulogne and reinforced the Belgian Army in Antwerp. Beseler attacked on 4 September, with three divisions on either side of the Scheldt towards Termonde, which captured the fortress and blew the bridges to the north.

===Second sortie, 9–13 September===
After the end of the first sortie, the Belgian field army joined the fortress troops in improving the defences between the forts, while the German besiegers consolidated their positions on an east–west line, about north of Brussels and away from the outer forts. On 31 August Beseler was made responsible for the security of the German forces around Antwerp from relief attempts from the west. battalions were transferred from the appointed to administer occupied Belgium, Field Marshal Von der Goltz and a division of the Marinekorps was ordered to the area.

On 1 September, the Belgians received information that the Germans were preparing to advance towards the Belgian western flank, on the Scheldt at Dendermonde. The Belgian commanders had received reports that the IX Reserve Corps and the 6th Division of the III Reserve Corps, were being relieved by the Marine Division and troops. The Germans had received agent reports of an imminent sortie from Antwerp, troops concentrations in western Belgium and northern France and the arrival of more British troops at Ostend. With the concentration of more troops and at Brussels underway, the reports caused no alarm.

The Belgian Army Command considered that the German attack on 4 September was a feint and began to plan another sortie, to induce the Germans to recall the troops being transferred to France and to disrupt German communications in central Belgium. German troop withdrawals were observed from A frontal attack was considered to be impossible given the extent of the German trenches but an attack on the eastern flank was considered possible. Two divisions were to remain inside the Antwerp defences, while three divisions and cavalry were to attack towards Aarschot. Important crossings over the Demer and Dyle rivers were quickly taken, Aarschot was captured and by 10 September, the cavalry reached the city of Leuven. The German 6th Reserve Division and IX Reserve Corps were recalled to the region, joining the 30th Division of XV Corps from Alsace, which conducted operations against the sortie between around Brussels. The Belgian advance was stopped and the army retired to Antwerp on 13 September.

===Third sortie, 26–27 September===

At Antwerp, the German concentration of troops on the south-eastern side of the line had left a gap to the north from the Dender to the Dutch frontier. The gap spanned about at the confluence of the Dender and the Scheldt rivers at Dendermonde, through which the defenders of Antwerp retained contact with western Belgium and the Allied forces operating on the coast and in northern France. After the Siege of Maubeuge in France, German super-heavy artillery was moved towards Antwerp which like Liège and Namur, would be untenable unless it could be incorporated into the main Allied front line, like the fortified regions of Verdun and Belfort in France. On 25 September the French General Staff (GQG) requested another sortie from Antwerp.

The Belgian General Staff began to plan another operation. Signs of German preparations for a general attack on Antwerp, led to the forces intended for the sortie being reduced. The 5th Division, elements of the 4th Division and the Cavalry Division, which held the defences on the west side of the National Redoubt at Dendermonde and the Waasland, attacked German troops moving westward from Aalst. Although they succeeded in making a small advance, a counter-attack by Brigade 37, supported by heavy artillery, led to the cancelling of the assault. On 28 September, the German bombardment of the Antwerp fortresses began.

==Battle==

===Bombardment===
The German bombardment began on 28 September, with German siege guns directed by observation balloons on gun emplacements, flanking positions and magazines, which were the most vital parts of the forts, had by on 29 September with &quot;extraordinary&quot; accuracy, made Fort Sint-Katelijne-Waver untenable and extensively damaged Fort Walem. Preparations to evacuate the Belgian Army to Ostend were begun by the Belgian Army Headquarters on 29 September and wounded, recruits, untrained men, prisoners of war, transport, equipment, ammunition and industrial machinery were gradually moved from Antwerp. The route out of the city crossed the Scheldt on two narrow pontoon bridges at the city centre and at Burcht. Trains had to run south along the right bank, cross the Rupel near German infantry positions only from the siege guns at Mechelen and then cross the railway bridge at Temse away. From trains with lights extinguished, ran each night unopposed. The 4th Division assembled at Dendermonde, where a German attack was expected and the Cavalry Division guarded the river line, to protect the escape route between the Dender and the coast. Early on 29 September, the Belgian Prime Minister, Charles de Broqueville, informed the British that if all the outer forts were lost, the government and field army of would withdraw to Ostend and leave the troops to hold Antwerp for as long as possible. The next day, de Broqueville formally appealed to the British and French governments for help.

===German attack===

On 1 October the German attack began on Forts Sint-Katelijne-Waver, Walem and the Bosbeek and Dorpveld redoubts by the 5th Reserve and Marine divisions. By Fort Walem was severely damaged, Fort Lier had been hit by a shell, Fort Koningshooikt and the Tallabert and Bosbeek redoubts were mostly intact and the intervening ground between Fort Sint-Katelijne-Waver and Dorpveld redoubt had been captured. A counter-attack had failed and the 4th Division had been reduced to The Belgian commanders ordered the left flank of the army to withdraw to another line of defence north of the Nete, which covered the gap in the outer defences and kept the city out of range of German super-heavy artillery. Proclamations warning the inhabitants that King Albert I and his Government would leave Antwerp, were put up during the day.

Fort Sint-Katelijne-Waver and Dorpveld redoubt were taken during the night of but Walem and the Bosbeek redoubt were not captured until the afternoon of 2 October, after every available German gun was used to bombard them. German bombardment of gun emplacements, destruction of magazines and the exhaustion of Belgian ammunition led to Forts Walem and Koningshooikt falling to the Germans and the evacuation or surrender of the remaining defences in the 3rd Sector except for the Duffel redoubt. The Belgian 2nd Division at the east side of the 3rd Sector, began to retire across the Nete at noon and an hour later the 1st Division began to withdraw to an unfinished intermediate position, from Rumst north-west of Fort Walem to Duffel and Lisp, above Lier, which had bridgeheads at Duffel, Anderstad and Lier. The 2nd Division was relieved by the 5th Division and went into reserve. No attempt was made by the Germans to pursue during the retirements, despite the inundations on the south bank of the Nete being only deep and patrols reported that no attempt had been made to cut the line of retreat from Antwerp.

The Duffel redoubt was evacuated on 3 October after the garrison ran out of ammunition and German artillery-fire was switched to Fort Kessel on the flank of the break-in. Next day German super-heavy guns began to bombard the fort, which forced the garrison to abandon the fort and German preparations for an attack on the line of the Nete were made, opposite Lier at the junction of the Grote and Kleine Nete and Duffel. The Royal Marine Brigade arrived opposite Lier in requisitioned London buses on 4 October and occupied a position around the northern fringe of Lier, which turned out to be sections of a shallow trench between hedgerows, with one strand of wire in front. Some skirmishing took place in the town and the position was bombarded by German artillery, against which the British had no reply except from an armoured train. German attacks between the Grote and Kleine Nete forced back the defenders and crossed the Dender; attempts were made to cross the Scheldt at Schoonaarde and Dendermonde.
At dawn on 5 October, two German battalions of Reserve Infantry Regiment 26 crossed the Nete at Anderstad farm, below Lier, under cover of enfilade fire from the outskirts of Lier, using a trestle bridge built in a creek nearby. The crossing-point was screened from view by vegetation and the two battalions were able to hold the river bank until dark when two more battalions crossed the river. Attacks at Lier had taken the town up to the line of the Kleine Nete and on the flank had reached the line of the inundations. German artillery commenced a bombardment of Fort Broechem to the north, which was devastated and evacuated on 6 October. The Belgian commanders decided to continue the defence of Antwerp, since the German advance had not brought the inner forts and the city within range of the German heavy artillery. Orders for a counter-attack against the German battalions on the north bank were not issued until on 6 October and did not arrive in time to all of the Belgian and British units in the area. Attacks made at local initiative by some Belgian units which recaptured some ground before being repulsed. The defenders withdrew to another unfinished position midway between the Nete and the inner forts, from Vremde south-east of the centre of Antwerp, to the Lier–Antwerp road and then south-west around Kontich during the day. The Marine Brigade moved to trenches north of the Lier–Antwerp road, under command of the Belgian 2nd Division.
On the western flank at Dendermonde on the Scheldt, south of Antwerp, Landwehr Brigade 37 was reinforced by Reserve Ersatz Brigade 1 and attempted to cross the river from at Schoonaarde, Dendermonde and Baasrode, downstream but were repulsed. By the afternoon of 6 October the 3rd and 6th divisions still held ground in front of the outer forts, between Fort Walem and the Scheldt to the south-west of Antwerp and around to the west but in the south and south-east the German attack had reached a line within of the city, which would be in range of the German guns as soon as they were brought across the Nete. The 6th Division was moved through Temse to reinforce the 4th Division and the Cavalry Division, which was guarding the escape corridor to the west. Two British naval brigades had arrived early on 6 October to reinforce the Marine Brigade but were diverted to of the inner ring, where the trenches were again found to be shallow and the ground cleared for in front which made them easily visible to German artillery observers.

In northern France, German troops engaged in mutual outflanking attempts, from the Aisne northwards since September, had reached Arras. Lens was captured by I Bavarian Reserve Corps on 5 October. Three German cavalry corps had attempted another flanking manoeuvre to the north and IV Cavalry Corps had reached Zwartberg and Mont des Cats near Ypres. The advance of the German army threatened to block the western retreat route of the Belgian army out of Antwerp. On 6 October discussions between the British and Belgians, led to a decision to withdraw the field army to the west bank of the Scheldt, where it could maintain contact with a relieving force and avoid the danger of being trapped on the east bank. On the night of the 1st, 3rd and 5th divisions crossed the river and joined the Cavalry, 4th and 6th divisions, as the eight forts of the inner ring were taken over by fortress troops. Intervening trenches between were occupied by the two British naval brigades and the 4th and 7th Fortress regiments, with the Belgian 2nd Division and British Marine Brigade in reserve. The British forces under the command of Major-General Archibald Paris, were ordered by First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, to continue the defence for as long as possible and to be ready to cross to the west bank rather than participate in a surrender.
Early on 7 October, two battalions of Regiment 37 were able to cross the Scheldt at Schoonaerde by boat, during a thick fog. The Belgian 6th Division made several counter-attacks which were repulsed and a bridge was built by the evening over which the rest of the Landwehr crossed. The width of the escape route from Antwerp had been reduced to fewer than , which led to the Belgian commanders ordering the field army to retreat behind the Terneuzen Canal, which ran from Ghent northwards to the Dutch border. The 1st and 5th divisions, which had lost most casualties and a brigade each of the 3rd and 6th divisions moved first and the remaining troops less the 2nd Division in Antwerp, formed a flank guard on the Scheldt and the Durme. The Belgian army headquarters moved to Zelzate further west. A Belgian improvised brigade was at Ghent and British troops in the area were requested to move to Ghent, after a German cavalry division was reported to be near Kruishoutem to the south-west. Later in the day German troops entered fort Broechem and the Massenhoven redoubt to the north unopposed, which widened the gap in the Antwerp defence perimeter to and began to move German super-heavy artillery over the Nete, which took until 8 October. At on 7 October German howitzers began to bombard the city.

By the night of 7 October the Belgian 2nd Division, the Royal Naval Division and the fortress garrison held the line of the inner forts at Antwerp, the Belgian field army was moving west between Ghent and the coast, a French naval brigade was en route to Ghent and the British 7th Division had concentrated at Bruges. Further west in a gap wide to the south-west of Ghent, Allied cavalry covered the ground between Lens and Hazebrouck, against three German cavalry divisions probing westwards. On 8 October at Antwerp, Brigade 37 was reinforced by Bavarian Brigade 1 and Brigade 9 from the 4th Division, which was being relieved by the Marine Division. The German attack pushed forward , which was close to Lokeren and also from the Dutch border. German air reconnaissance had reported that roads west of Antwerp were clear and many people were moving north towards the frontier, which was assumed to mean that the Belgian army was not trying to escape to the west. The Belgian command had expected to withdraw the 1st and 5th divisions by rail but a lack of rolling stock led to most troops moving by road, while the 2nd Division remained in Antwerp, the 3rd Division was at Lokeren, the 4th, 6th divisions were on either flank and the Cavalry Division was to the west, covering the railway to Ghent.

===Belgian withdrawal===

The 4th and 6th divisions began to retire during the day, although delayed by the German advance to Lokeren and during the night of most of the field army moved west of the Ghent–Zelzate Canal, with rearguards from Loochristy northwards; the 4th Brigade moved to Ghent, where French arrived in the morning. The British 7th Division moved from Bruges to Ostend, to cover the landing of the 3rd Cavalry Division, parts of which arrived on 8 October. By the night of the Belgian field army had escaped from Antwerp and had assembled north-west of Ghent, which was garrisoned by three Allied brigades; at Ostend from Ghent, were the British 7th Division and the 3rd Cavalry Division. At Lokeren, the German attack on Antwerp had begun to close the escape route and at Antwerp, German heavy artillery had been moved across the Nete to bombard of the inner ring and the city.

Fires could not be put out after the waterworks had been hit; rampart gates on the (main defensive wall) where the wet ditches were bridged were also bombarded. The shelling of caused little damage but facing east, were attacked by Brigade 26 to outflank which faced south to cut off the garrisons. Erroneous reports to the Belgian and British commanders before dawn on 8 October that had fallen, led to a decision that if they were not recaptured, the inner line would be abandoned at dusk and the defenders withdrawn to the city ramparts. The ramparts were earth parapets with shelters underneath and had (passages) protruding on the flanks, with moats wide and deep in front.
The Belgian and British commanders decided to continue the defence of Antwerp with the garrison troops and move the Belgian 2nd Division and the British troops across the Scheldt, when the erroneous report was corrected and it was decided that if were lost, the Royal Naval Division would withdraw at dusk. News arrived that the forts had fallen at and orders were sent to the Belgian 2nd Division and the British to retire. The Belgian division withdrew in stages between and and crossed the Scheldt by The British began to retire at but the orders failed to reach all of the 1st Naval Brigade, only one battalion of which withdrew. At the mistake was realised as the rest of the division began to cross the river from and moved west parallel to the Dutch frontier. The 1st Naval Brigade reached the Scheldt at midnight, only to find that the bridges were being demolished and under a German shrapnel bombardment. The troops crossed using barges and boats and set out for a rendezvous at Zwijndrecht, which was reached at on 9 October. The British moved on to Sint-Gillis-Waas, where information arrived that the Germans had cut the railway at Moerbeke. The British commander Commodore Henderson, decided to head for the Dutch border to the north and at half the original complement were interned and about forty stragglers managed to sneak along the border and escape.
The British forces in Belgium were instructed on 8 October to cover the retirement of the Belgians and British from Antwerp to Ghent, Zelzate, Ostend, Torhout and Diksmuide and then join the left flank of the BEF, as it advanced into Flanders. On 9 October most of the 7th Division moved to join the French and Belgian forces at Ghent, as the 3rd Cavalry Division and the rest of the 7th Division assembled at Bruges; the French 87th Territorial Division was ordered to stop its move to Antwerp at Poperinghe. The British forces came under the command of the BEF as IV Corps, with the 8th Division once it arrived from England (11 November). The BEF II Corps was assembling at Abbeville and Rawlinson, the commander of the new IV Corps, was instructed to hold on at Ghent for as long as possible. The retirement from Antwerp proceeded satisfactorily and no German troops were seen west of Aalst, south-east of Ghent. A German force encountered at Melle from Ghent on the night of was driven off with many casualties by the French marines.

A conference between the Belgians, French and British at Ostend on 10 October, decided to hold Ghent as the Belgian field army continued its retirement. By nightfall the 1st, 3rd and 4th divisions were at Ostend, the 5th and 6th divisions were at Torhout and Diksmuide and the Antwerp garrison troops were in an area north-west of Ghent. The German besiegers had not discovered the retirement and the 4th Ersatz Division and Landwehr troops at Lokeren and Moerbeke, turned east towards the city before the withdrawal was discovered. The III Reserve Corps and the 4th Ersatz Division were then ordered to turn west and advance on Kortrijk. The move was to prolong the main German front, before being sent towards Ghent and Bruges, with orders to reach Blankenberge and Ostend on the coast. On 11 October, German troops were detected advancing on Ghent but by then the Belgian fortress troops had joined the field army and a staged withdrawal from Ghent from had begun, after which German troops entered the city. Several bridges were demolished during the retirement, although crowds of civilians on the main road and rail bridges led to those not being destroyed.

===Capitulation===

Early on 9 October German troops found some of the forts of the inner ring empty; Beseler had the bombardment stopped and summoned the Military Governor, General Deguise to surrender. As German made their way to Antwerp, four civilian representatives, including the Mayor of Antwerp, Jan De Vos, reached Beseler at Kontich, to request an end to the bombardment of the city. During the afternoon, under threat of a resumption of the bombardment, the civilian representatives signed a capitulation of the city and such fortresses which continued to hold out. On the morning of 10 October, when the Chief of Staff of the Military Governor appeared with authority to discuss surrender, he was presented with a and had to agree to the terms already accepted.

The last of the Antwerp garrison surrendered and the city was occupied by German troops until November 1918. of the Antwerp garrison fled north to the Netherlands, where they were interned for the rest of the war, as far as possible from the Belgian border, for fear of compromising Dutch neutrality. The British troops were interned at Groningen and the Belgians were accommodated at Zeist, Gaasterland, Amersfoort, and Oldebroek. The internees were employed in various industries. Germans who crossed the frontier were interned at Bergen. About one million civilian refugees left in 1914 for Great Britain, the Netherlands and France; most returned after the siege but a sizeable number of the refugees in the Netherlands remained after 1918. Several Belgian military refugees are nowadays buried or commemorated at the Belgian Military Field of Honour 1914–1918 in Harderwijk.

== Aftermath ==

===Analysis===
In the &quot;History of the Great War&quot; (1915–1948), the official British account of World War I, James Edmonds wrote that although the operations to save Antwerp had failed, the resistance of the defenders (after the outer forts were destroyed) detained German troops, when they were needed for operations against Ypres and the coast. Ostend and Zeebrugge were captured unopposed, while further west Nieuwpoort (Nieuport) and Dunkirk were held by the Allies, which thwarted the final German attempt to turn the Allied northern flank. The troops from Antwerp were also needed to cover the approach of four German corps towards Ypres, which caused delays to all the German manoeuvres in the north.

Edmonds wrote that it had been a mistake to assume that second line troops were sufficient to hold fortifications and that the effect on recruits and over-aged reservists of being subjected to heavy artillery-fire, which destroyed &quot;impregnable&quot; defences as the field forces retreated to safety, had a deleterious effect on morale, which could only be resisted by first-class troops. A large amount of ammunition and many of the at Antwerp were captured intact by the Germans. The men of the Belgian field army escaped westwards, with most of the Royal Naval Division. The British lost and prisoner.

===Subsequent operations===
The Belgian forces which had escaped from Antwerp had been in action for two months and the King planned to withdraw west of a line from St Omer–Calais to rest the army, incorporate recruits and train replacements but was persuaded to assemble the army on a line from Dixmude, north to the port of Nieuport and Furnes to the south-west of the port to maintain occupation of Belgian territory. The Belgian Army continued its retirement on covered by the original Cavalry Division and a second one formed from divisional cavalry, along with cyclists and motor machine-gun sections. On 14 October the Belgian army began to dig in along the Yser, the 6th and 5th Divisions to the north of French territorial divisions from Boesinghe, along the Yser canal to Dixmude, where the Fusiliers Marins had formed a bridgehead, covered by the artillery of the Belgian 3rd Division, with the rest of the division in reserve at Lampernisse to the west. The 4th, 1st and 2nd Divisions prolonged the line north with advanced posts at Beerst, Keyem, Schoore and Mannekensvere, about forward on the east bank. A bridgehead was also held near the coast around Lombartzyde and Westende to cover Nieuport, with the 2nd Cavalry Division in reserve. On 18 October the German III Reserve Corps from Antwerp, began operations against Belgian outposts on the east bank from Dixmude to the sea, in the Battle of the Yser 

The Allied forces around Ghent withdrew on the approach of German forces on 11 October. The British 7th Division moved to Aeltre to the west, made rendezvous with British detachments, which had moved inland from Bruges and began to march to Ypres. The southern flank was covered by the 3rd Cavalry Division, which had moved from Thourout to Roulers and the French Fusiliers Marins brigade moved on to Dixmude. At Thielt on the night of General Capper, the 7th Division commander was informed that German cavalry near Hazebrouck had retired on the approach of the British II Corps, leaving the country west of the 7th Division clear of German forces. The division reached Roulers on met BEF cavalry near Kemmel and linked with the French 87th Territorial Division around Ypres. The German IV Cavalry Corps had moved south four days previously, except for several who were disturbed by a party arranging billets and captured by the 10th Hussars.

By 18 October the Belgian, British and French troops in northern France and Belgium had formed a line with the BEF II Corps in position with the 5th Division from La Bassée Canal north to Beau Puits, the 3rd Division from Illies to Aubers and three divisions of the French Cavalry Corps of General Conneau in position from Fromelles to Le Maisnil, the BEF III Corps with the 6th Division from Radinghem to Epinette and the 4th Division from Epinette to Pont Rouge, the BEF Cavalry Corps with the 1st and 2nd Cavalry divisions, from Deulemont to Tenbrielen, the BEF IV Corps with the 7th Division and 3rd Cavalry Division from Zandvoorde to Oostnieuwkirke, the French and the de Mitry Cavalry Corps from Roulers to Cortemarck, the French 87th and 89th Territorial Divisions from Passchendaele to Boesinghe and then the Belgian Field Army and fortress troops from Boesinghe to Nieuport (including the Fusilier Marin brigade at Dixmude). The Battle of the Yser began on 16 October.

<text>Prestwood is a village in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located in the Chiltern Hills, about two miles west of Great Missenden and six miles north of High Wycombe.

==History==

===Early history and creation of parish===
The village name is Anglo-Saxon in origin, and means &quot;Priest-wood&quot;. There is evidence of settlement in Prestwood from the Middle Ages, when the village was mainly covered in oak, beech and ash trees. &quot;Hatches Farm&quot; is one of the buildings that dates from the medieval period.

By 1849, more of the woodland had been cleared to make way for agriculture and common land, around which approximately 100 houses now existed. Many villagers worked in cottage industries such as lace making, and a wheelwright was also present in the village. Many of the villagers made use of the common land to graze animals; there were about 70 watering ponds. In addition, gorse was harvested for fuel. Beech trees made up the bulk of the woodland, and were used in the local furniture industry. The small village population was served by five separate public houses.

Prestwood came into being as an ecclesiastical parish in 1852, following consecration of the new Holy Trinity Church in 1849. The new parish combined portions of the parishes of Missenden, Hughenden and Hampden. The first vicar of Holy Trinity planted a set of ornamental trees behind the church; this now forms Prestwood Park.

In the Victorian era, Prestwood and nearby Great Missenden lay on the road between London and Birmingham. The two villages became important resting points for travellers; several rest inns came into being. Prestwood&#x27;s pubs – now numbering twelve – owe part of their legacy to this fact; the name of the &quot;Travellers&#x27; Rest&quot; pub being a notable example.

===Early 20th century===

Following 1850, much of the common land was sold off for agricultural development. By 1900, only a small amount of common land remained; today, Prestwood Common on Nairdwood Lane is one of the only pieces of common land still present in the village. Some of the watering holes remained, in addition to wells which were used for drinking water until the pipe network reached Prestwood in the 1930s.

As well as the Holy Trinity church, a Methodist church was constructed on the High Street and another on Bryrants Bottom. In addition, a Baptist chapel was founded on Kiln Lane (now called Kiln Road). The main industry in Prestwood continued to be agriculture; orchards were created and much of the fruit was sold to traders in London.

Prestwood continued to grow in area and population throughout the early part of the 20th century. Prestwood Infant School opened in Moat Lane in 1908, replacing the church school. The village hall was opened in 1928 by Rosamund Parker, Countess of Macclesfield. The arrival of the railway in Great Missenden improved access to central London, leading to Prestwood becoming a commuter village. However, the expansion of the village was not without its setbacks; houses were built in Perks Lane, destroying the orchids that grew there. After a long absence, orchids have recently been spotted in Cadsden near Princes Risborough.

Many agricultural businesses flourished in Prestwood. &quot;Wren Davis Dairy&quot; opened on Wycombe Road, winning award nationally for the quality of its milk. Today the dairy owns several acres of fields in the north and west of Prestwood, on which its cows still graze. Cornelius Stevens established a farmhouse, gardens, slaughterhouse and butcher&#x27;s shop (named &quot;C. Stevens and Sons&quot;) on land then known as Square Farm, in the centre of the village. His four eldest sons took over the business upon his death in 1932; when it closed down in the 1980s, the steel blood bins were buried on land now belonging to Prestwood Junior School. &quot;Gaybird Ltd&quot; supplied pheasant chicks and eggs to shoots throughout the country, raising the birds in fields stretching from Prestwood as far away as Dunsmore, near Wendover. Their produce was regularly exhibited at the annual national Game Fair. Finally, a pie factory was constructed, called &quot;Farmer Giles&quot;; the site is now used for an elderly residential home called &quot;Giles Gate&quot;.

Prestwood was home to former British Prime Minister Earl Attlee from 1950. He later moved to Martinsend Lane in Great Missenden. The house was also occupied by the late musician and broadcaster, Steve Race.

World War II

In the Second World War, a prisoner of war camp was established at Peterley Wood, whilst Prestwood Park House was used as a hospital. Two bombers collided over Prestwood with much of the wreckage falling close to Nanfans (or Nafans) Farm on Honor End Lane. Only one member of the two crews survived the collision. A plaque commemorating the tragedy can be found outside the Limes Tea House at the local garden centre, Hildreths of Prestwood.

===Late 20th century===

By the 1960s, the last brickworks in the village had closed and many of the orchards had been concreted over; however, the former orchid site at Perks Lane was reclaimed by the local council and turned into a nature reserve and picnic site. Despite the continued growth of the village population, four pubs closed down – the &quot;George&quot;, the &quot;Weathercock&quot;, the &quot;Golden Ball&quot; and the &quot;White Horse&quot;.

In the 1960s and 70s many large houses were constructed in Prestwood, helping to attract families to the village. This was reflected in the building of two new schools – Prestwood Junior School and Prestwood Lodge School.

Despite the loss of the London Underground steam service to the nearby Great Missenden railway station, an overground service has and still does continue, run by Chiltern Railways. These benefits are one reason for the district in which Prestwood lies (Chiltern) being the most expensive rural district in the entire United Kingdom.

===Present day===

In January 2000 a further elderly home consisting of 30 flats was opened, called &quot;Cherry Orchard&quot;, leading to an increase in the number of retired people living in the village. In the early hours of Saturday 9 December 2006, a large fire swept through the Cherry Orchard residential home, killing one elderly woman and forcing 12 others to be rescued. Most of the ground floor was gutted in the fire, which started when a resident left clothes on top of a faulty electric radiator; all of the residents were moved out until rebuilding work could be completed.

In 2001, the old Prestwood Leisure Centre was demolished. After a much-delayed rebuilding programme over the following two years, the Sprinters Fitness Centre opened in its place in 2003. It included three newly built tennis courts and two fitness studios. The opening helped to revitalise Prestwood&#x27;s economy and continues to attract people from the surrounding area.

The land on which Prestwood&#x27;s only petrol station existed was bought by &quot;Beeks Homes Ltd&quot; in 2002. The petrol station was demolished on the premise that, whilst new homes would be built on the site, a smaller petrol station would also be included in the plans. When Beeks turned back on these plans, two years of legal wranglings ensued between the company and the parish council; eventually, the council relented and solely homes were constructed.

In July 2007 a new park was built on Prestwood common and was opened by Cherie Blair.

In March 2016 the public house formerly known as &quot;The Chequers&quot; relaunched as &quot;The Chequers Tree&quot; after locals objected to it being renamed as &quot;The Prestwood&quot; by owners Greene King.

*During the 19th century Prestwood was famous for its cherry orchards and parties of Londoners would travel out to the area during the spring to view the blossoms.
*Chequers, the country residence of the Prime Minister, is a few miles north of the village. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair often brought his family to the Great Missenden Catholic church in Great Missenden at the weekends.

<text>Radclive is a village on the River Great Ouse just over west of Buckingham in Buckinghamshire, England. It is in the civil parish of [[Radclive-cum-Chackmore]] in Aylesbury Vale district. The parish includes the hamlet of Chackmore about north of Buckingham.

Radclive&#x27;s toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;red cliff&quot;, referring to the colour of the local soil and a cliff overlooking the river. The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village as &quot;Radeclive&quot;.

Parts of the Church of England parish church of Saint John the Evangelist date from 1200 but the tower is believed to be 100 years later. There are some rare early English pews decorated with poppy heads, and a Jacobean communion rail with openwork balustrading. The nave window contains some examples of 14th century stained glass that survived the English Reformation and the English Civil War.

The Manor House was built in about 1620 and is the remaining part of a much larger mansion. The house contains an original oak staircase which has an open balustrade with finial topped ovals and lozenges, very similar in design to the staircase at Princes Risborough Manor House.

That portion of Radclive south of the River Ouse once formed the &quot;lost&quot; Domesday manor of Hasley, formerly thought erroneously to have formed part of Thornton.

<text>Stephen Johnson Turre (born September 12, 1948, in Omaha, Nebraska) is an American jazz trombonist and a pioneer of using seashells as instruments, a composer, arranger, and educator at the collegiate-conservatory level. For years, Turre has been active in jazz, rock, and Latin jazz – in live venues, recording studios, television, and cinema production.

He has recorded over 20 albums as a bandleader, and appeared on many more as a contributor or sideman. As a studio musician, Turre is among the most prolific living jazz trombonists in the world. He has been a member of the Saturday Night Live Band since 1985.

== Early life ==
Turre is one of five children born to James Boles Turre (1921–1997) and Carmen Marie &quot;(née&quot; Johnson). His father was of Northern Italian ancestry and his mother was of Mexican ancestry. His grandfather Ernest Turre was a founder of the San Francisco 49ers with Tony Morabito. His four siblings are Michael James Turre (b. 1946), Suzanne Turre (born 1952), Michele Anita Turre (born 1953), and Peter Joseph Turre (born 1957). Michael and Peter were musicians – saxophone-woodwinds and drums, respectively.

Turre was raised in Lafayette, California (San Francisco Bay area). He began playing trombone at age ten, during his fourth grade in school. In his early teens, he played in a band with his elder brother, Michael. Although he entered California State University, Sacramento, on a football scholarship, he studied music theory there for two years before transferring to the University of North Texas College of Music, where he studied from 1968 to 1969 and played in a band led by trumpeter Hannibal Peterson.

Turre has been a resident of Montclair, New Jersey.

== Personal life ==
Turre has been married three times. His first wife was Susan J. Beard, whom he married in 1970 in Dallas, Texas, and divorced in 1972 in San Francisco. His second wife was cellist Akua Dixon (born 1948) from 1978 to 2012, with whom he had two children, Andromeda Turre, a jazz vocalist and composer and Orion Turre a jazz drummer.
His present wife is Pamela Turre whom he married on September 24, 2017.

== Career highlights ==

In 1968, Turre played with Rahsaan Roland Kirk. In 1970 he recorded with Carlos Santana, and in 1972 he toured with Ray Charles. He has been trombonist for the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; band since 1985 and has taught jazz trombone at the Manhattan School of Music since 1988.

For years (since 1970), Turre has been an exponent of seashells – conch in particular – as serious musical instruments. According to Turre, encouragement came from Kirk who was known for using a vast array of saxophones, flutes and other instruments. Turre has a collection of shells of various sizes, most of them picked up during his travels in the Caribbean and elsewhere. The shells have their mouthpieces carefully cut and are tuned to specific pitches. When playing them as a soloist, he frequently switches between shells, as each is limited in its register (the smallest shells, for example, have a practical register of only a fifth). His largest shell, from the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, has a range between the D and E below middle C, and was painted by a Cuban artist. He also leads &quot;Sanctified Shells,&quot; which is a &quot;shell choir&quot; made up of brass players who double on seashell (using shells from Turre&#x27;s collection, which he loans out for rehearsals and performances). The group released its first, eponymous album in 1993. Turre has had a long experience with Latin jazz and is a skilled player of the cowbell and Venezuelan maracas.
Turre has been a member of the Juilliard School faculty for years – since 2008, and previously from 2001 to 2003.

Turre earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst through the University Without Walls in 1980 with a focus in Afro-American Music and Jazz.

<doc id="418568" wikidata="Q709509" url="?curid=418568" title="Arthur Godfrey">
<text>Arthur Morton Godfrey (August 31, 1903 – March 16, 1983) was an American radio and television broadcaster and entertainer. At the peak of his success, in the early to mid-1950s, Godfrey was heard on radio and seen on television up to six days a week, at times for as many as nine separate broadcasts for CBS. His programs included &quot;Arthur Godfrey Time&quot; (Monday-Friday mornings on radio and television), &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot; (Monday evenings on radio and television), &quot;Arthur Godfrey and His Friends&quot; (Wednesday evenings on television), &quot;The Arthur Godfrey Digest&quot; (Friday evenings on radio) and &quot;King Arthur Godfrey and His Round Table&quot; (Sunday afternoons on radio).

The infamous on-air firing of cast member Julius La Rosa in 1953 tainted Godfrey&#x27;s down-to-earth, family-man image and resulted in a marked decline in his popularity which he was never able to overcome. Over the following two years, Godfrey fired over twenty additional cast and crew members, under similar circumstances, for which he was heavily attacked by the press and public alike. A self-made man, Godfrey was fiercely competitive; some of his employees were fired for merely speaking with those he considered to be competitors, like Ed Sullivan, or for signing with an agent. By the late 1950s, his presence had been reduced to hosting his daily CBS radio show, which ended in 1972, and the occasional television special.

Sometimes introduced by his nickname “The Old Redhead”, Godfrey was strongly identified with many of his commercial sponsors, especially Chesterfield cigarettes and Lipton Tea. He advertised Chesterfield for many years, during which time he devised the slogan &quot;Buy &#x27;em by the carton&quot;; he terminated his relationship with the company after he quit smoking, five years before he was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1959. He later became a prominent spokesman for the anti-tobacco movement.

== Early life ==
Godfrey was born in Manhattan in 1903 to Arthur Hanbury Godfrey and Kathryn Morton Godfrey. His mother was from a well-to-do Oswego, New York, family, which disapproved of her marriage. An older Englishman, the senior Godfrey was a sportswriter and considered an expert on surrey and hackney horses, but the advent of the automobile devastated the family&#x27;s finances. By 1915, when Arthur was 12, the family had moved to Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. Godfrey dropped out after a single year at Hasbrouck Heights High School. The eldest of five children, he worked before and after school at an early age, and left home at 14 to ease the financial burden on his family. A year later he was a civilian typist at Camp Merritt, New Jersey, and enlisted in the United States Navy at 17, lying about his age.
Godfrey&#x27;s father was something of a &quot;free thinker&quot; by the standards of the era. He did not disdain organized religion but insisted that his children explore all faiths before deciding for themselves which to embrace. Their childhood included friends of Catholic, Jewish and various Protestant faiths. The senior Godfrey was friends with the Vanderbilts, but was democratic in his associations and enjoyed talking about issues of the day to total strangers. In the book &quot;Genius in the Family&quot; (G.P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons, New York, 1962), written about their mother by Godfrey&#x27;s youngest sister, Dorothy Gene (who preferred to be called &quot;Jean&quot;), with the help of their sister, Kathy, it was reported that the angriest they ever saw their father was when a man on the ferry declared the Ku Klux Klan a civic organization vital to the good of the community. They rode the ferry back and forth three times, with their father arguing with the man that the Klan was a bunch of &quot;Blasted, bigoted fools, led &#x27;round by the nose!&quot;

Godfrey&#x27;s mother, Kathryn, was a gifted artist and composer whose aspirations to fame were laid aside to take care of her family after her husband, whom she called &quot;Darl&#x27;&quot;, died. Her creativity enabled the family to get through some very hard times. She played the piano to accompany silent films, made jams and jellies, crocheted bedspreads, and even cut off and sold her long hair, as it was extremely difficult for a woman of her social class to find work without violating social mores of the time. The one household item that was never sold was the piano, and she believed at least some of her children would succeed in show business. In her later years some of her compositions were performed by symphony orchestras in Canada, which earned her a mention in &quot;Time&quot;. In 1958, at the age of 78, her sauciness made her a big hit with the audience when she appeared on Groucho Marx&#x27;s quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;. She died of cancer in 1968 at a nursing home in a suburb north of Chicago.

Godfrey served in the Navy from 1920 to 1924 as a radio operator on naval destroyers, then returned home to care for the family after his father&#x27;s death. Additional radio training came during Godfrey&#x27;s service in the Coast Guard from 1927 to 1930. He passed a stringent qualifying examination and was admitted to the prestigious Radio Materiel School at the Naval Research Laboratory, graduating in 1929. During a Coast Guard stint in Baltimore he appeared in a local talent show broadcast on October 5 of that year and became popular enough to land his own brief weekly program.

== Radio ==
On leaving the Coast Guard, Godfrey became a radio announcer for Baltimore station WFBR (now WJZ (AM)), then moved to Washington, D.C., to become a staff announcer for NBC-owned station WRC the same year. He remained there until 1934.

Recovering from a near-fatal automobile accident en route to a flying lesson in 1931 (he was already an avid flyer), he decided to listen closely to the radio and realized that the stiff, formal style then used by announcers could not connect with the average radio listener. The announcers spoke in stentorian tones, as if giving a formal speech to a crowd and not communicating on a personal level. Godfrey vowed that when he returned to the airwaves, he would affect a relaxed, informal style as if he were talking to just one person. He also used that style to do his own commercials and became a regional star. Over time, he added wisecracks to his commercials and would kid the sponsors, a risky move that offended advertising agency executives whose staff worked on the commercial scripts. Nonetheless, Godfrey&#x27;s antics quickly gained acceptance when his sponsors discovered their sales actually increased after Godfrey&#x27;s added jokes. At times, he would read an ad agency script on television as he mockingly rolled his eyes, used a sarcastic tone of voice or added his own wisecracks. Since the sponsors approved, given their added sales, the agencies were powerless to stop him.

In addition to announcing, Godfrey sang and played the ukulele. In 1934 he became a freelance entertainer, but eventually based himself on a daily show titled &quot;Sundial&quot; on CBS-owned station WJSV (later WTOP and now WFED) in Washington. Godfrey was the station&#x27;s morning disc jockey, playing records, delivering commercials (often with tongue in cheek; a classic example had him referring to Bayer Aspirin as &quot;bare ass prin&quot;), interviewing guests, and even reading news reports during his three-hour shift. Godfrey loved to sing, and would frequently sing random verses during the &quot;talk&quot; portions of his program. In 1937, he was a host on &quot;Professor Quiz&quot;, radio&#x27;s first successful quiz program. One surviving broadcast from 1939 has Godfrey unexpectedly turning on his microphone to harmonize with the Foursome&#x27;s recording of &quot;There&#x27;ll Be Some Changes Made&quot;.

Godfrey was eager to remain connected with the Navy, but found his hip injuries rendered him unsuitable for military service. He knew President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who listened to his Washington program, and through Roosevelt&#x27;s intercession, he received a commission in the U.S. Naval Reserve before World War II. He would participate in exercises around the Washington area. Godfrey eventually moved his base to the CBS station in New York City, then known as WABC (later WCBS, now WHSQ), and was heard on both WJSV and WABC for a time. In the autumn of 1942, he also became the announcer for Fred Allen&#x27;s &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; show on the CBS network, but a personality conflict between Allen and Godfrey led to his early release from the show after only six weeks.

Godfrey became nationally known in April 1945 when, as CBS&#x27;s morning-radio man in Washington, he took the microphone for a live, firsthand account of President Roosevelt&#x27;s funeral procession. The entire CBS network picked up the broadcast, later preserved in the Edward R. Murrow and Fred W. Friendly record series, &quot;I Can Hear it Now&quot;. Unlike the tight-lipped news reporters and commentators of the day, who delivered news in an earnest, businesslike manner, Godfrey&#x27;s tone was sympathetic and neighborly, lending immediacy and intimacy to his words. When identifying new President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s car in the procession, Godfrey fervently said, in a choked voice, &quot;God bless him, President Truman.&quot; Godfrey broke down in tears and cued the listeners back to the studio. The entire nation was moved by his emotional outburst.

CBS gave Arthur Godfrey his own morning time slot on the nationwide network. &quot;Arthur Godfrey Time&quot; was a Monday–Friday show that featured his monologues, interviews with various stars, music from his own in-house combo, and regular vocalists. Godfrey&#x27;s monologues and discussions were usually unscripted, and went wherever he chose. &quot;Arthur Godfrey Time&quot; remained a late morning staple on the CBS Radio Network schedule until 1972.

Two radio monologues proved to be audience favorites and were rebroadcast on several occasions by popular demand, and later on his television show. They were &quot;What is a Boy?&quot; and a follow-up, &quot;What is a Girl?&quot; With the skilled addition of sentimental music, both monologues captured the essence of what made parents love their children, fondly describing the highly varied personality traits of each child as the monologue progressed. Each monologue struck a chord with everyone who heard it. &quot;What is a Boy?&quot; in particular proved to be so popular that it was released as one of Godfrey&#x27;s records, which he issued on Columbia Records (Record no. 39487) in the summer of 1951, with &quot;What is a Girl?&quot; on the B-side of the record. It reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in August 1951, one of several successful records Godfrey released between 1947 and 1952.

Godfrey was also known for sparking impromptu jam sessions on the air with the band, all of them first-rate musicians who could improvise on the fly. He would sometimes begin singing along with his ukulele, the band falling in behind him. At other times, he would jump into a number sung by one of the &quot;Little Godfreys&quot; and continue it, encouraging solos from various band members. It was further proof of his insistence on spontaneity on the air. He began to play a baritone ukulele. Over time, tutored by the band&#x27;s guitarist Remo Palmier, Godfrey&#x27;s playing took a decidedly jazzy quality. Palmier, a top Manhattan studio guitarist, was also a respected jazz guitarist and the only one of Godfrey&#x27;s musicians to remain with the show from its 1945 debut until the final 1972 broadcast.

In 1947, Godfrey had a surprise hit record with the novelty &quot;Too Fat Polka (She&#x27;s Too Fat For Me)&quot; written by Ross MacLean and Arthur Richardson. The song reached number two in the US charts and its popularity led to the Andrews Sisters recording a version adapted to the women&#x27;s point-of-view. In general, Godfrey despised most of his novelty recordings, including &quot;Too Fat Polka&quot;, which was his biggest-selling record with over one million copies sold.

Godfrey&#x27;s morning show was supplemented by a prime time variety show, &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;, broadcasting from the CBS Studio Building at 49 East 52nd Street, where he had his main office. This variety show, a showcase for rising young performers, was a slight variation of CBS&#x27;s successful &quot;Original Amateur Hour&quot;. Some of the performers had made public appearances in their home towns and were recommended to Godfrey by friends or colleagues. These &quot;sponsors&quot; would accompany the performers to the broadcast and introduce them to Godfrey on the air. Two acts from the same 1948 broadcast were Wally Cox and the Chordettes. Both were big hits that night, and both were signed to recording contracts. Godfrey took special interest in the Chordettes, who sang his kind of barbershop-quartet harmony, and he soon made them part of his broadcasting and recording &quot;family&quot;. Godfrey was also known for extemporizing music on the show, grabbing his ukulele and launching into songs the band may not have rehearsed. He had insisted on employing musicians in his small orchestra who would be able to accompany him quickly and &quot;follow&quot; him as he sang. This resulted in impromptu jam sessions on some broadcasts, rarely heard on mainstream variety programs.

Performers who appeared on &quot;Talent Scouts&quot; included Lenny Bruce, Don Adams, Tony Bennett, Patsy Cline, Lu Ann Simms, Pat Boone, opera singer Marilyn Horne, Roy Clark, and Irish vocalist Carmel Quinn. Later, he promoted &quot;Little Godfrey&quot; Janette Davis to a management position as the show&#x27;s talent coordinator. Three notable acts rejected for the show were Buddy Holly, the Four Freshmen, and Elvis Presley. Following his appearances on the &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;, Presley traveled to New York for an unsuccessful &quot;Talent Scouts&quot; audition in April 1955. After the &quot;Talent Scouts&quot; staff rejected the Orioles, they went on to have a hit record with their version of &quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot; (a cover of the song by Darrell Glenn, written by his father, Artie, and a subsequent hit for Presley as well). That success kicked off the &quot;bird group&quot; trend of early rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.

Godfrey was also an avid amateur radio operator, with the station call sign K4LIB. He was a member of the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in the radio division.

Beginning in January 1950, another Godfrey program on CBS Radio, &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Digest&quot;, was a transcribed compilation of highlights from morning shows of the preceding week. The 30-minute show was broadcast on Saturdays at 9:30 p.m. Eastern Time, sponsored by Chesterfield cigarettes.

== Theatre ==
In 1946, Arthur appeared in the Broadway revue &quot;Three to Make Ready,&quot; &quot;offering monologues and serving as a kind of master of ceremonies.&quot; In 1965, he appeared as Harry Lambert in &quot;Never Too Late&quot; at the Playhouse Theatre, with Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan.

== Television ==

In 1948, &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot; began to be simultaneously broadcast on radio and television, and by 1952, &quot;Arthur Godfrey Time&quot; also appeared on both media. The radio version ran an hour and a half; the TV version an hour, later expanded to an hour and a half. The Friday shows were heard on radio only, because at the end of the week, Godfrey traditionally broadcast his portion from a studio at his Virginia farm outside of Washington, D.C., and TV cameras were unable to transmit live pictures of him and his New York cast at the same time. Godfrey&#x27;s skills as a commercial pitchman brought him a large number of loyal sponsors, including Lipton Tea, Frigidaire, Pillsbury cake mixes and Liggett &amp; Myers&#x27;s Chesterfield cigarettes. By 1959, total advertising billings from Godfrey&#x27;s TV shows were estimated at an industry-high $150 million, almost double those of second-place Ed Sullivan. 

Godfrey found that one way to enhance his pitches was to extemporize his commercials, poking fun at the sponsors (while never showing disrespect for the products themselves), the sponsors&#x27; company executives, and advertising agency types who wrote the scripted commercials that he regularly ignored. (If he read them at all, he ridiculed them or even threw aside the scripts in front of the cameras.) To the surprise of the advertising agencies and sponsors, Godfrey&#x27;s flippancy during the commercials frequently enhanced the sales of the sponsor&#x27;s products. His popularity and ability to sell brought a windfall to CBS, accounting for a significant percentage of their corporate profits. While his willingness to mock the scripted commercials provided to him by sponsors&#x27; ad agencies angered those agencies, the sponsors, concerned only with improving their sales, were happy to let Godfrey tear apart those scripts (even physically on occasion).

In 1949, &quot;Arthur Godfrey and His Friends&quot;, a weekly informal variety show, began on CBS-TV in prime time. His affable personality combined warmth, heart, and occasional bits of &quot;double entendre&quot; repartee, such as his remark when the show went on location: &quot;Well, here we are in Miami Bitch. Hehheh.&quot; Godfrey received adulation from fans who felt that despite his considerable wealth, he was really &quot;one of them&quot;, his personality that of a friendly next-door-neighbor. His ability to sell products, insisting he would not promote any in which he did not personally believe, gave him a level of trust from his audience, a belief that &quot;if Godfrey said it, it must be so.&quot; When he quit smoking after his 1953 hip surgery, he began speaking out on the air against smoking, to the displeasure of longtime sponsor Chesterfield. When he stood his ground, the company withdrew as a sponsor in early 1954. Godfrey shrugged off their departure since he knew other sponsors would easily fill the vacancy.

Eventually Godfrey added a weekend &quot;best of&quot; program culled from the week&#x27;s &quot;Arthur Godfrey Time&quot;, known as &quot;Arthur Godfrey Digest&quot;. He began to veer away from interviewing stars in favor of a small group of regular performers that became known as the &quot;Little Godfreys&quot;. Many of these artists were relatively obscure, but were given colossal national exposure, some of them former &quot;Talent Scouts&quot; winners, including Hawaiian vocalist Haleloke, veteran Irish tenor Frank Parker, Marion Marlowe and Julius La Rosa, who was in the Navy when Godfrey, doing his annual Naval reserve duty, discovered the young singer. He subsequently invited him on the show as a guest, offering him a job upon his discharge. La Rosa joined the cast in 1951 and became a favorite with Godfrey&#x27;s immense audience, who also saw him on the prime-time weekly show &quot;Arthur Godfrey and his Friends&quot;. Godfrey also had a regular announcer-foil on the show, Tony Marvin. Godfrey preferred his performers not to use personal managers or agents, but often had his staff represent the artists if they were doing personal appearances, which allowed him considerable control over their careers and incomes. In 1953, after La Rosa hired an agent, Godfrey was so angry that he fired him on the air.

Godfrey was one of the busiest men in the entertainment industry, often presiding over several daytime and evening radio and TV shows simultaneously. (Even busier was Robert Q. Lewis, who hosted &quot;Arthur Godfrey Time&quot; whenever Godfrey was absent, adding to his own tight schedule.) Both Godfrey and Lewis made commercial recordings for Columbia Records, often featuring the &quot;Little Godfreys&quot; in various combinations. In addition to the &quot;Too Fat Polka&quot;, these included &quot;Candy and Cake&quot;; &quot;Dance Me Loose&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover&quot;; &quot;Slap &#x27;Er Down Again, Paw&quot;; &quot;Slow Poke&quot;; and &quot;The Thing&quot;. In 1951 Godfrey also narrated a nostalgic movie documentary, &quot;Fifty Years Before Your Eyes&quot;, produced for Warner Brothers by silent-film anthologist Robert Youngson.

Godfrey had been in pain since the 1931 car crash that damaged his hip. In 1953, he underwent pioneering hip replacement surgery in Boston using an early plastic artificial hip joint. The operation was successful and he returned to the show to the delight of his vast audience. During his recovery, CBS was so concerned about losing Godfrey&#x27;s audience that they encouraged him to broadcast live from his Beacon Hill estate (near Leesburg, Virginia), with the signal carried by microwave towers built on the property.

Godfrey&#x27;s immense popularity and the trust placed in him by audiences was noticed not only by advertisers but also by his friend, President Dwight Eisenhower, who asked him to record a number of public service announcements to be played on American television in the case of nuclear war. It was thought that viewers would be reassured by Godfrey&#x27;s grandfatherly tone and folksy manner. The existence of the PSA recordings was confirmed in 2004 by former CBS president Dr. Frank Stanton in an exchange with a writer with the web site Conelrad.

== Racehorse owner ==
Arthur Godfrey was a fan of Thoroughbred horseracing which led to him becoming an owner of several racehorses. His best known was Lord Willin’ as a result of the horse having an important part in a nationally televised movie titled &quot;Post Time: U.S.A.&quot; 

== Aviation ==
Godfrey learned to fly in 1929 while working in broadcast radio in the Washington, D.C., area, starting with gliders, then learning to fly airplanes. He was badly injured on his way to a flying lesson one afternoon in 1931 when an oncoming truck lost its left front wheel and hit him head on. Godfrey spent months recuperating, and the injury kept him from flying on active duty during World War II. He served in a public affairs role during the war as a reserve officer in the United States Navy.

Godfrey used his pervasive fame to advocate a strong anti-Communist stance and to pitch for enhanced strategic air power in the Cold War atmosphere. In addition to his advocacy for civil rights, he became a strong promoter of his middle-class fans&#x27; vacationing in Hawaii and Miami Beach, Florida, formerly enclaves for the wealthy. In Hawaii, he helped raise funds for the &quot;Coronation&quot; carillon installed at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in 1956.

He made a television movie in 1953, taking the controls of an Eastern Air Lines Lockheed Constellation airliner and flying to Miami, thus showing how safe airline travel had become. As a reserve officer, he used his public position to cajole the Navy into qualifying him as a Naval Aviator, and played that against the United States Air Force, who later successfully recruited him into the Air Force Reserve.

His continued unpaid promotion of Eastern Air Lines earned him the undying gratitude of good friend Eddie Rickenbacker, the World War I flying ace who was the president of the airline. He was such a good friend of the airline that Rickenbacker took a retiring Douglas DC-3, fitted it out with an executive interior and DC-4 engines, and presented it to Godfrey, who then used it to commute to the studios in New York City from his huge Leesburg, Virginia, farm every Sunday night.

===Aviation incidents===
In January 1954, Godfrey buzzed the control tower of Teterboro Airport in his DC-3. His certificate was suspended for six months. He claimed the windy conditions that day required him to turn immediately after takeoff, but in fact he was upset because the tower would not give him the runway he requested. He later recorded a satirical song about the incident called &quot;Teterboro Tower&quot;, roughly to the tune of &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot;. A similar event occurred while he flew near Chicago in 1956, though no sanctions were imposed.

===Leesburg airport===
The original Leesburg airport, which Godfrey owned and referred to affectionately on his show as &quot;The Old Cow Pasture&quot;, was less than a mile from the center of town, and local residents had come to expect rattling windows and crashing dishes every Sunday evening and Friday afternoon.

In 1960, Godfrey proposed building a new airport by selling the old field and donating a portion of the sale to a local group. Since Godfrey funded the majority of the airport, it is now known as Leesburg Executive Airport at Godfrey Field. He was also known for flying a North American/Ryan Navion, a smaller single-engined airplane, a Lockheed Jetstar, and in later years a Beech Baron and a Beech Duke, registration number N1M. In 1964, he became one of the founding members of the board of directors of Executive Jet Aviation Corporation.

== Behind the scenes ==


When the Godfrey show began appearing on television, some Southern CBS affiliates objected to the Mariners barbershop quartet. This group of four US Coast Guard veterans included two whites and two blacks. Godfrey resisted criticism from network affiliates in Southern states and struck back. He noted that black and white troops were serving together in the Korean War, and he attacked critics including Democratic Georgia Governor Herman Talmadge. Godfrey&#x27;s opposition to racial discrimination was longstanding, alluded to on his broadcasts.

According to several people who worked either for or closely with Godfrey, behind his on-air warmth and benevolent image was a volatile, egomaniacal and controlling personality. He insisted that his &quot;Little Godfreys&quot; all attend dance and singing classes, believing they should be versatile performers regardless of whether they possessed the aptitude for those disciplines. In meetings with his staff and cast, he could be abusive, sarcastic and intimidating. CBS historian Robert Metz, in &quot;CBS: Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye&quot;, quoted Godfrey as having once told cast and staffers, &quot;Remember that many of you are here over the bodies I have personally slain. I have done it before and I can do it again.&quot; Julius La Rosa claimed in an interview with writer Gene Lees it occurred during what were referred to as Wednesday night “prayer meetings” held after that night’s show to start preparing for the next week’s. Godfrey also demanded, though there was no contractual requirement, that his cast members refrain from hiring personal managers or booking agents. He insisted his staff could handle all of that. Given the rise of the &quot;Little Godfreys&quot; from total obscurity due to their exposure on Godfrey&#x27;s popular programs, no one felt inclined to challenge him. Despite his ability to bring in huge profits to the network, most CBS executives who respected Godfrey professionally disliked him personally, since he often baited them on and off the air, occasionally by name, even including CBS chairman William S. Paley.

Godfrey&#x27;s attitude was controlling before his hiatus for hip surgery, but upon his return, he added more air time to his morning shows and became critical of a number of aspects of the broadcasts. One night, he substituted a shortened, hastily arranged version of his Wednesday night variety show in place of the scheduled &quot;Talent Scouts&quot; segment, feeling that none of the talent that evening was up to his standards. He also began casting a critical eye on others in his cast, particularly La Rosa, whose popularity continued to grow.

===La Rosa incident===


Like many men of his generation, Julius La Rosa, as well as other male Godfrey cast members, thought dance lessons to be somewhat effeminate and bristled when Godfrey ordered them for his entire performing crew. CBS historian Robert Metz suggested that Godfrey had instituted the practice because his own physical limitations made him sensitive to the need for physical coordination on camera. &quot;Godfrey&quot;, Metz wrote, &quot;was concerned about his cast in his paternalistic way&quot;.

Godfrey and La Rosa had a dispute in the fall of 1953, when La Rosa, the most popular of the &quot;Little Godfreys&quot;, missed a dance lesson due to a &quot;family emergency&quot;. He said he had advised Godfrey, but was nonetheless barred, via a notice placed on a cast bulletin board, from appearing on the show for a day in retaliation. La Rosa went to Godfrey&#x27;s hotel and attempted to discuss the incident, but after being rebuffed by Godfrey&#x27;s assistants, he waited in the lobby. When Godfrey came into the lobby, he reportedly walked past La Rosa as if he wasn&#x27;t there and refused to talk with him. At that point, La Rosa, whose success on records had brought interest from top show business managers and agents, retained manager Tommy Rockwell to renegotiate his contract with Godfrey or, failing that, to receive an outright release; however, such talks had yet to occur.
La Rosa was also signed to Cadence Records, founded by Godfrey&#x27;s musical director Archie Bleyer, who produced &quot;Eh, Cumpari!&quot;, the best-selling record of La Rosa&#x27;s musical career. La Rosa later admitted the record&#x27;s success had made him a little cocky. Godfrey discovered La Rosa had hired Rockwell in the wake of the dance lesson reprimand, when he received a letter from Rockwell dictating that all future dealings with La Rosa would be handled through General Artists Corporation, Rockwell&#x27;s agency. At that point, Godfrey immediately consulted CBS President Dr. Frank Stanton, who noted Godfrey had hired La Rosa on the air and suggested firing him the same way. Whether Stanton intended this to occur after Godfrey spoke with La Rosa and his manager about the singer&#x27;s future on the program, or whether Stanton suggested Godfrey actually fire La Rosa on air without warning, is unknown. Soon after the firings, Stanton conceded &quot;maybe this was a mistake&quot;.

On October 19, 1953, near the end of his morning radio show – deliberately waiting until &quot;after&quot; the television portion had ended – after lavishing praise on La Rosa in introducing the singer&#x27;s performance of &quot;Manhattan&quot;, Godfrey thanked him and then announced that this was La Rosa&#x27;s &quot;swan song&quot; with the show, adding, &quot;He goes now, out on his own – as his own star – soon to be seen on his own programs, and I know you&#x27;ll wish him godspeed as much as I do&quot;. Godfrey then signed off for the day, saying, &quot;This is the CBS Radio Network&quot;. La Rosa, who did not know what the phrase &quot;swan song&quot; meant, was incredulous when told he had just been fired, since he had not been informed beforehand of his termination, and contract renegotiations had not yet taken place. Radio historian Gerald Nachman, claims in &quot;Raised on Radio&quot; that what truly angered Godfrey about his now-former protegé was that La Rosa&#x27;s fan mail had come to exceed Godfrey&#x27;s. It is probable that a combination of these factors led to Godfrey&#x27;s decision to discharge La Rosa. Godfrey very likely did not expect the public backlash that followed, a result of the incident running directly counter to Godfrey&#x27;s solicitous, paternal image.

The La Rosa incident was the beginning of an era of controversy that enveloped Godfrey, gradually destroyed his folksy image, and diminished his popularity. La Rosa&#x27;s was not, however, the only firing that day. Godfrey also fired Archie Bleyer. In 1952, Bleyer had formed his own record label, Cadence Records, which had a contract with La Rosa; Bleyer also married Janet Ertel of The Chordettes. The focus of Godfrey&#x27;s anger was the fact that Bleyer, while on hiatus from the show, had produced a spoken-word record by Godfrey&#x27;s Chicago counterpart Don McNeill to be issued by Cadence. McNeill hosted &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, which had been Godfrey&#x27;s direct competition on the NBC Blue Network (later ABC) since Godfrey&#x27;s days at WJSV. Despite the far more modest following of the McNeill show, Godfrey still felt Breyer had been disloyal. According to Godfrey, a meeting between Bleyer and Godfrey immediately following La Rosa&#x27;s dismissal revealed Bleyer was unconcerned about the matter. He claimed Bleyer simply shrugged off the dismissal and focused on developing Cadence, which found significant success with hit records by the Everly Brothers and Andy Williams. Bleyer himself never commented publicly on the rift with Godfrey.

La Rosa’s firing did not sit well with his fans. LaRosa went on the offensive by holding a press conference with his agent. On October 21, with public animosity towards Godfrey steadily rising, Godfrey announced the firings of La Rosa and Bleyer had been due to their &quot;outside activities&quot;. While praising La Rosa, Godfrey added he felt that La Rosa had lost his &quot;humility&quot;. Almost instantly, Godfrey and the phrase &quot;no humility&quot; became the butt of many comedians&#x27; jokes.

In November 1953 singer-songwriter Ruth Wallis, renowned for her &quot;double-entendre&quot; &quot;party records&quot;, wrote and recorded a topical novelty song, &quot;Dear Mr. Godfrey&quot;, with the pointed lyric &quot;hire me and fire me and make a star of me.&quot; The record, self-published by Wallis, was an immediate sensation, selling more than 100,000 copies during its first 10 days of release, and launching Wallis on a whirlwind nightclub tour later that same month.

Godfrey later said he had given La Rosa a release from his contract that the singer had personally requested. Godfrey, however, provided no evidence to support that contention.

===The firings continue===


After his 1953 hospitalization broke his smoking habit, he had concluded that smoking was not beneficial and very likely harmful, a total reverse from his earlier commercials. His once-friendly rapport with the Liggett &amp; Myers tobacco company ended as he spoke out on the air against smoking. The Teterboro Airport incident in January 1954 kept Godfrey&#x27;s image negative in the media. 

Godfrey subsequently fired other producers, writers, and cast members including Marion Marlowe, Lu Ann Simms, Haleloke, and The Mariners. The integrated quartet (two members of the foursome were African-American) believed Godfrey had acceded to continued criticism from CBS affiliates in the South over the group&#x27;s presence on the show. Pat Boone and Carmel Quinn joined the cast for a time. But any thoughts of Godfrey curtailing the fired cast members&#x27; network-television exposure backfired somewhat when they continued to perform for Godfrey&#x27;s substitute host, Robert Q. Lewis, who at that point had his own afternoon show on CBS.

Occasionally, Godfrey snapped at cast members on the air, including Tony Marvin. Other performers, most notably Pat Boone and, briefly, Patsy Cline, stepped in as &quot;Little Godfreys&quot;. Cline, who had won top honors for her appearance on &quot;Talent Scouts&quot;, declined to become a regular, confining her appearances to a few guest spots. Eventually, Godfrey did away with any regular cast except Marvin, bringing in performers for a stipulated period of time and, if they did well with his audiences, bringing them back at various times.

Godfrey&#x27;s problems with the media and public feuds with newspaper columnists, such as Jack O&#x27;Brian and newspaperman turned CBS variety show host Ed Sullivan, were duly documented by the media, which began running critical exposé articles linking Godfrey to affairs with several female &quot;Little Godfreys&quot;. Godfrey&#x27;s anger at Sullivan stemmed from the variety show impresario&#x27;s featuring fired &quot;Little Godfreys&quot; on his Sunday night program, including La Rosa. Godfrey later dismissed long-time vocalist Frank Parker, an Italian-American known for his Irish tenor. Godfrey had been told Parker made jokes about him during a Las Vegas appearance.

===Allegations of anti-Semitism===


Accusations of anti-Semitism shadowed Godfrey during the height of his career and continue to persist. Eddie Fisher, in his autobiography, &quot;Been There, Done That&quot;, discusses the rumor:

Arthur J. Singer, author of &quot;Arthur Godfrey: The Adventures of an American Broadcaster&quot; (2000), rejects this accusation, citing Godfrey&#x27;s good personal relations with a number of Jews in the entertainment industry, including his longtime announcer Tony Marvin. As for Godfrey&#x27;s association with the Kenilworth, the hotel did establish a &quot;No Jews&quot; policy in the 1920s, but abandoned it when Godfrey acquired a stake in the hotel in the early 1950s. In the eyes of the public, the increasingly negative, and largely self-inflicted publicity Godfrey, despite his ongoing popularity, had generated since 1953 no doubt added credence to the accusations. In fact Godfrey was only a part-owner of the hotel and insisted that when he took that stake, he &quot;ended&quot; any discriminatory policies that existed. Further undermining Fisher&#x27;s account, he appeared on &quot;Talent Scouts&quot; years before Godfrey purchased a part interest in the Kenilworth.

Dick Cavett, in an opinion piece for the &quot;New York Times&quot; (July 16, 2010), calls the accusations of anti-Semitism &quot;...purest nonsense&quot;.

== Later life ==

Godfrey was an avid hunter who teamed with professional guides to hunt big-game animals on safari in Africa.

In 1959, Godfrey began suffering chest pains. Examination by physicians revealed a mass in his chest that could have been lung cancer. Surgeons discovered cancer in one lung that spread to his aorta. One lung was removed. Yet, despite the disease&#x27;s discouragingly high mortality rate, it became clear after radiation treatments that Godfrey had beaten the substantial odds against him. He returned to the air on a prime-time TV special but resumed the daily morning show on radio only, reverting to a format featuring guest stars such as ragtime pianist Max Morath and Irish vocalist Carmel Quinn, maintaining a live combo of first-rate Manhattan musicians (under the direction of Sy Mann) as he had done since the beginning. Godfrey also became a persuasive spokesman advocating regular medical checkups to detect cancer early, noting his cancer was cured only because it was discovered when still treatable.

Godfrey&#x27;s initial return to television occurred in a TV special centered on his gratitude to have survived what was by 1959 standards, an almost-certain death sentence. He sang, danced, did commercials and announced that he&#x27;d make greater use of the new videotape technology for the future. Despite appearing healthy on the broadcast, Godfrey, fearing the after-effects of his illness would adversely affect his appearance, announced that he would resume the Monday–Friday &quot;Arthur Godfrey Time&quot; on radio only, ending the daily TV broadcasts.

Long-time announcer Tony Marvin, with Godfrey since the late 1940s, did not make the transition to the new program. Marvin was one of Godfrey&#x27;s few associates who left on amicable terms, and went on to a career as a radio news anchor on the Mutual Broadcasting System. The Godfrey show was the last daily long-form entertainment program on American network radio when Godfrey and CBS agreed to end it in April 1972, when his 20-year contract with the network expired. Godfrey by then was a colonel in the United States Air Force Reserve and still an active pilot.

He appeared in the films &quot;4 for Texas&quot; (1963), &quot;The Glass Bottom Boat&quot; (1966), and &quot;Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows&quot; (1968). He briefly co-hosted the 1960–61 debut season of &quot;Candid Camera&quot; with creator Allen Funt, but that relationship, like so many others, ended abruptly and acrimoniously; Godfrey hosted at least one broadcast &quot;without&quot; Funt. Godfrey also made various guest appearances, and he and Lucille Ball co-hosted the CBS special &quot;50 Years of Television&quot; (1978). He also made a cameo appearance in the 1979 B-movie &quot;Angels Revenge&quot;.

===Post-retirement===

In retirement, Godfrey wanted to find ways back onto a regular TV schedule. He appeared on rock band Moby Grape&#x27;s song &quot;Just Like Gene Autry: A Foxtrot&quot;, a 1920s-pop-style piece from their album &quot;Wow&quot;. 

Godfrey&#x27;s political outlook was complex, and to some, contradictory; his lifelong admiration for Franklin Roosevelt combined with a powerful libertarian streak in his views and his open support for Dwight D. Eisenhower as president. 

During his later years he became a powerful voice for the environmentalist movement who identified with the youth culture that irreverently opposed the &quot;establishment&quot;, as he felt that he had done during his peak years. He renounced a lucrative endorsement deal with Colgate-Palmolive when it became clear to him that it clashed with his environmental principles. He had made commercials for Colgate toothpaste and the detergent Axion, only to repudiate the latter product when he found out that Axion contained phosphates, implicated in water pollution. He did far fewer commercials after that incident.

While Godfrey was a great fan of technology, including aviation and aerospace developments, he also found time for pursuits of an earlier era. He was a dedicated horseman and master at dressage and made charity appearances at horse shows.

He also found in later years that his enthusiasm for high-tech had its limits when he concluded that some technological developments posed the potential to threaten the environment. During one appearance on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, Godfrey commented that the United States needed the supersonic transport (SST) &quot;about as much as we need another bag of those clunkers from the moon.&quot; The concern that the SST contributed to noise pollution, an issue Godfrey was instrumental in raising in the United States, is considered to have effectively ended SST interest in the U.S., leaving it to Britain and France. (Cavett claims that Godfrey&#x27;s statement also earned tax audits from the Richard Nixon-era Internal Revenue Service for the show&#x27;s entire production staff.)

Although Godfrey&#x27;s desire to remain in the public eye never faltered, his presence ebbed considerably over the next ten years, despite an HBO special and an appearance on a PBS salute to the 1950s. A 1981 attempt to reconcile him with La Rosa for a Godfrey show reunion record album, bringing together Godfrey and a number of the &quot;Little Godfreys&quot;, collapsed. Godfrey had initially resisted the idea, floated by his agent, but finally relented. At an initially amicable meeting, Godfrey reasserted that La Rosa wanted out of his contract and asked why he had not explained that instead of insisting he was fired without warning. When La Rosa began reminding him of the dance lesson controversy, Godfrey, then in his late seventies, exploded and the meeting ended in shambles.

===The Arthur Godfrey Collection===
Toward the end of his life, Godfrey became a major supporter of public broadcasting, and left his large personal archive of papers and programs to public station WNET/Thirteen in New York. Godfrey biographer Arthur Singer helped to arrange a permanent home for the Godfrey material at the Broadcasting Archives at the University of Maryland in early 1998. The collection contains hundreds of kinescopes of Godfrey television programs, more than 4,000 audiotapes and wire recordings of his various radio shows, videotapes, and transcription discs. The collection also contains Godfrey&#x27;s voluminous personal papers and business records, which cover his spectacular rise and precipitous fall in the industry over a period of more than 50 years.

== Personal life ==
Godfrey was married twice. He and his first wife, Catherine, had one child. He was next married to the former Mary Bourke from February 24, 1938, until their divorce in 1982, a year before his death. They had two children.

==Death==
Godfrey began to suffer from emphysema, thought to have been caused by decades of smoking and the radiation treatments for his lung cancer, in the early 1980s. He died from it at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan on March 16, 1983, at the age of 79, and was buried at Union Cemetery in Leesburg, Virginia, not far from his farm.

<doc id="418570" wikidata="Q3414212" url="?curid=418570" title="Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation">
<text>The Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation is given each year for theatrical films, television episodes, or other dramatized works related to science fiction or fantasy released in the previous calendar year. Originally the award covered both works of film and of television but since 2003, it has been split into two categories: Best Dramatic Presentation (Long Form) and Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form). The Dramatic Presentation Awards are part of the broader Hugo Awards, which are given every year by the World Science Fiction Society for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year. The awards are named after Hugo Gernsback, the founder of the first science fiction magazine, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, and was once officially known as the Science Fiction Achievement Award. The award has been described as &quot;a fine showcase for speculative fiction&quot;.

==History==

The award was first presented in 1958, and with the exceptions of 1964 and 1966 was given annually through 2002 when it was retired in favor of the newly created Dramatic Presentation (Long Form) and Dramatic Presentation (Short Form) categories, which divided the category depending on whether the work was longer or shorter than 90 minutes. In the 1964 and 1966 awards there were insufficient nominations made to support the category. Prior to 1971, the category was defined as including works from &quot;radio, television, stage or screen&quot;, and thereafter was expanded to &quot;any medium of dramatized science fiction or fantasy&quot;, resulting in the nomination of recorded songs and other works. In addition to the regular Hugo awards, since 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given. To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954; the 1946 and 1951 awards were for the Best Dramatic Presentation category while the 1939, 1945, and 1954 awards were for the Short Form category. There were insufficient nominations to support an award in the Long Form category for those years. The 1941 and 1944 awards were for both Long and Short Form.

Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. The 1958 awards did not include any recognition of runner-up magazines, but since 1959 all six candidates were recorded. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year&#x27;s Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations, and no more than two works per series allowed on the final ballot. Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year. Members are permitted to vote &quot;no award&quot;, if they feel that none of the nominees is deserving of the award that year, and in the case that &quot;no award&quot; takes the majority the Hugo is not given in that category. This has happened in the Dramatic Presentation category four times, in 1959, 1963, 1971, and 1977.

The award is typically for television and film presentations, but occasionally rewards works in other formats: in 1970 it was awarded to news coverage of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, while in 1971 a concept album and a comedy album were nominated. Another comedy album was nominated the following year, and a slideshow was nominated in 1976. A radio play was nominated in 1979, and all of the 1939 Retro Hugo awards were for radio plays. In 2004, an acceptance speech from the 2003 MTV Movie Awards won the award, while in 2006, a skit from the opening of the previous year&#x27;s award ceremony (pretending to be for the &quot;&quot;Victor&quot; Hugo Award&quot;) was nominated. An audiobook was nominated in 2009, another acceptance speech was nominated in 2012, a concept album was nominated in 2017, and a song was nominated in 2018.

During the 74 nomination years, 43 awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, 23 awards each for Short Form and Long Form, and 11 Retro Hugo awards have been given. The individual franchises with the most awards are the revived 2000s-era &quot;Doctor Who&quot; with 6 Short Form awards out of 37 nominations, &quot;Star Wars&quot; with 3 Best Dramatic Presentation awards out of 3 nominations as well as 4 Long Form and 5 Short Form nominations, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; with 3 Best Dramatic Presentation awards out of 4 nominations, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; with 3 wins out of a Long Form and 5 Short Form nominations, &quot;The Good Place&quot; with 4 wins out of 6 Short Form nominations. Other shows or series with multiple awards or nominations include the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series with 2 wins out of 8 nominations, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; with 2 wins out of 3 nominations, &quot;The Expanse&quot; with 3 wins out of 6 Short Form nominations, and &quot;Babylon 5&quot; with 2 wins out of 4 nominations. Less successful were the Marvel Cinematic Universe with 1 win out of 15 Long Form and 3 Short Form nominations, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; with 1 out of 6, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (2004) with 1 of 5, and &quot;Harry Potter&quot; with no awards after 7 nominations. The members of the hip hop group Clipping are the only musical artists to have earned two nominations for their works, first for their 2016 album &quot;Splendor &amp; Misery&quot; and then for their 2017 song &quot;The Deep&quot;.

== Winners and nominees ==

In the following tables, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the work was first published. Entries with a yellow background and an asterisk (*) next to the work&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list. Entries with a gray background and a plus sign (+) mark a year when &quot;no award&quot; was selected as the winner. In the case of television presentations, the award is generally for a particular episode rather than for a program as a whole; however, sometimes, as in the case of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, it was given for the series&#x27; body of work that year rather than for any particular episode.

=== 1958–2002 ===

  *   Winner(s)
  +   No winner selected

=== 2003–present ===
Starting with the 2003 awards, the Dramatic Presentation award was split into two categories: Best Dramatic Presentation (Long Form) and Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form). The Long Form award is for &quot;a dramatized production in any medium, including film, television, radio, live theater, computer games or music. The work must last 90 minutes or longer (excluding commercials).&quot; The Short Form award is for &quot;a dramatized production in any medium, including film, television, radio, live theater, computer games or music. The work must last less than 90 minutes (excluding commercials).&quot; An individual work such as a television show can be nominated for a season in the Long Form category or for individual episodes in the Short Form, though not for both in the same year. As of 2017, a single show is limited to two nominations in the Short Form category per year.

==== Long Form ====
==== Short Form ====
=== Retro Hugos ===
Beginning with the 1996 Worldcon, the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for 50, 75, or 100 years prior. Retro Hugos may only be awarded for years in which a Worldcon was hosted, but no awards were originally given. The 1939, 1941, and 1943—1945 awards were given 75 years later; the other three awards were given 50 years later. In 1946 and 1951, an award was given for Best Dramatic Presentation, as the category had not yet been split, while in 1939, 1943, 1945, and 1954 an award was given for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. The Long Form category did not receive enough nominations for an award to be given in those years. The 1941 and 1944 Retro Hugos awarded both Long and Short Forms.

<doc id="418571" wikidata="Q3007274" url="?curid=418571" title="Culture of Equatorial Guinea">
<text>While lying on the enriched continent of Africa, Equatorial Guinea has proved to be entrenched in ancient rituals and songs. This is especially true for the Fang, a people whose territories begin at the southern edge of Cameroon south of Kribi, Djoum, and in the South Province and continue south across the border, including all of Río Muni in Equatorial Guinea, and from there south into Gabon and Congo. The capital island of Bioko has largely been influenced by Spanish customs and traditions during the colonial period, when education and health services were developed in the country.

==Traditions==
Many Bubi farmers still hold to their ancient customs. One of the country&#x27;s most famous celebrations is the &quot;abira&quot;, which is believed to cleanse the community of evil. The &quot;balélé&quot; dance is performed along the coast throughout the year and on Bioko around Christmas.

==Religion, race, and language==
Most people in the country are nominally Christian, but practice a combination of Roman Catholicism and traditional pagan customs.

Spanish, French, and Portuguese are the official languages of the country.

Despite a veneer of Spanish culture and of Roman Catholic religion that is thicker in Bioko than on the mainland, Equatorial Guineans live largely according to ancient customs, which have undergone a revival since independence. Among the Fang of the mainland, witchcraft, traditional music (in which the Fang harp, the xylophone, the great drums, and the wooden trumpet are used), and storytelling survive. Spanish aid is much oriented to educational and health services. Among the Bubi farmers of Bioko, some ancient customs are still followed.

==Music==
The Fang is known for the mvet, an instrument that looks like a cross between a zither and a harp, and can have up to fifteen strings. The semi-spherical part of this instrument is made of bamboo, and the strings are attached to the center by fibers. Music for the mvet is written in the form of musical notation that can only be learned by the initiates of the bebom-mvet society. Music is typically call and response with a chorus and drums alternating.

==Cinema==
Juan Pablo Ebang Esono is one of the top filmmakers in the country. In 2010, Esono directed &quot;Teresa&quot;, the first medium-length film to be produced in Equatorial Guinea.

Calls to an overloaded function will run a specific implementation of that function appropriate to the context of the call, allowing one function call to perform different tasks depending on context.

For example, and are overloaded functions. To call the latter, an object must be passed as a parameter, whereas the former does not require a parameter, and is called with an empty parameter field. A common error would be to assign a default value to the object in the second function, which would result in an &quot;ambiguous call&quot; error, as the compiler wouldn&#x27;t know which of the two methods to use.

Another example is a function that executes different actions based on whether it&#x27;s printing text or photos. The two different functions may be overloaded as If we write the overloaded print functions for all objects our program will &quot;print&quot;, we never have to worry about the type of the object, and the correct function call again, the call is always: .

==Languages supporting overloading==

Languages which support function overloading include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:

* Ada
* Apex
* C++
* C#
* Clojure
* D
* Swift
* Fortran
* Kotlin
* Java
* Julia
* PostgreSQL and PL/SQL
* Scala
* TypeScript
* Visual Basic (.NET)
* Wolfram Language
* Elixir
* Nim
* Crystal
* Delphi
* Python

Languages which does not support function overloading include C, Rust and Zig.

==Rules in function overloading==
* The same function name is used for more than one function definition in a particular module, class or namespace
* The functions must have different type signatures, i.e. differ in the number or the types of their formal parameters (as in C++) or additionally in their return type (as in Ada).

Function overloading is usually associated with statically-typed programming languages that enforce type checking in function calls. An overloaded function is a set of different functions that are callable with the same name. For any particular call, the compiler determines which overloaded function to use and resolves this at compile time. This is true for programming languages such as Java.

Function overloading differs from forms of polymorphism where the choice is made at runtime, e.g. through virtual functions, instead of statically.

Example: Function overloading in C++

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int Volume(int s) { // Volume of a cube.
 return s * s * s;

double Volume(double r, int h) { // Volume of a cylinder.
 return 3.1415926 * r * r * static_cast&lt;double&gt;(h);

long Volume(long l, int b, int h) { // Volume of a cuboid.
 return l * b * h;

int main() {
 std::cout « Volume(10);
 std::cout « Volume(2.5, 8);
 std::cout « Volume(100l, 75, 15);


In the above example, the volume of each component is calculated using one of the three functions named &quot;volume&quot;, with selection based on the differing number and type of actual parameters.

==Constructor overloading==
Constructors, used to create instances of an object, may also be overloaded in some object-oriented programming languages. Because in many languages the constructor&#x27;s name is predetermined by the name of the class, it would seem that there can be only one constructor. Whenever multiple constructors are needed, they are to be implemented as overloaded functions. In C++, default constructors take no parameters, instantiating the object members with their appropriate default values, &quot;which is normally zero for numeral fields and empty string for string fields&quot;. For example, a default constructor for a restaurant bill object written in C++ might set the tip to 15%:
Bill()
 : tip(0.15), // percentage
 total(0.0)


The drawback to this is that it takes two steps to change the value of the created Bill object. The following shows creation and changing the values within the main program:
Bill cafe;
cafe.tip = 0.10;
cafe.total = 4.00;
By overloading the constructor, one could pass the tip and total as parameters at creation. This shows the overloaded constructor with two parameters. This overloaded constructor is placed in the class as well as the original constructor we used before. Which one gets used depends on the number of parameters provided when the new Bill object is created (none, or two):
Bill(double tip, double total)
 : tip(tip),
 total(total)


Now a function that creates a new Bill object could pass two values into the constructor and set the data members in one step. The following shows creation and setting the values:
Bill cafe(0.10, 4.00);
This can be useful in increasing program efficiency and reducing code length.

Another reason for constructor overloading can be to enforce mandatory data members. In this case the default constructor is declared private or protected (or preferably deleted since C++11) to make it inaccessible from outside. For the Bill above total might be the only constructor parameter since a Bill has no sensible default for total whereas tip defaults to 0.15.

==Complications==
Two issues interact with and complicate function overloading: Name masking (due to scope) and implicit type conversion.

If a function is declared in one scope, and then another function with the same name is declared in an inner scope, there are two natural possible overloading behaviors: the inner declaration masks the outer declaration (regardless of signature), or both the inner declaration and the outer declaration are included in the overload, with the inner declaration masking the outer declaration only if the signature matches. The first is taken in C++: &quot;in C++, there is no overloading across scopes.&quot; As a result, to obtain an overload set with functions declared in different scopes, one needs to explicitly import the functions from the outer scope into the inner scope, with the keyword.

Implicit type conversion complicates function overloading because if the types of parameters do not exactly match the signature of one of the overloaded functions, but can match after type conversion, resolution depends on which type conversion is chosen.

These can combine in confusing ways: An inexact match declared in an inner scope can mask an exact match declared in an outer scope, for instance.

For example, to have a derived class with an overloaded function taking a or an , using the function taking an from the base class, in C++, one would write:
class B {
 public:
 void F(int i);

class D : public B {
 public:
 using B::F;
 void F(double d);


Failing to include the results in an parameter passed to in the derived class being converted to a double and matching the function in the derived class, rather than in the base class; Including results in an overload in the derived class and thus matching the function in the base class.

==Caveats==
If a method is designed with an excessive number of overloads, it may be difficult for developers to discern which overload is being called simply by reading the code. This is particularly true if some of the overloaded parameters are of types that are inherited types of other possible parameters (for example &quot;object&quot;). An IDE can perform the overload resolution and display (or navigate to) the correct overload.

Type-based overloading can also hamper code maintenance, where code updates can accidentally change which method overload is chosen by the compiler.

<text>Näsinneula (; ) is an observation tower in Tampere, Finland, overseeing Lake Näsijärvi. It was built in 1970–1971 and was designed by Pekka Ilveskoski. It is the tallest free-standing structure in Finland and at present the tallest observation tower in the Nordic countries at a height of . The tower opened in 1971 and is located in the Särkänniemi amusement park. There is a revolving restaurant in the tower above the ground; one revolution takes 45 minutes. The design of Näsinneula was inspired by the Space Needle in Seattle. The idea of a revolving restaurant was taken from the Puijo Tower, which is located in Kuopio, the city of North Savonia.

The base of the tower is at about of elevation from lake Näsijärvi. There are two elevators, which were changed to new Kone elevators in 2020. Before the update the elevators were manufactured by Valmet-Schliren. The elevators go up to a height of , to the Pilvilinna (&quot;Cloud Castle&quot;) café. The restaurant (called Näsinneula) is one story higher.

The elevator ride to the top takes 27 seconds with a maximum speed of and the elevators carry a maximum of 16 people. The elevators are still the fastest public elevators in Finland. In the event of a blackout, the tower&#x27;s own diesel emergency generator will start. In an emergency, people can be evacuated with stairs that have 700 steps.

Beacon lights at the top of the tower display a weather forecast:

<text>Särkänniemi (; &#x27;Cape of Sandbank&#x27;) is an amusement park in Tampere, Finland, located in the district by the same name. The park features an aquarium, a planetarium, Doghill Fairytale Farm, an art museum and an observation tower Näsinneula (Näsi Needle). Särkänniemi is the second most popular amusement park in Finland with Linnanmäki in Helsinki being the most popular one. Särkänniemi has four rollercoasters: the inverted coaster Tornado, the family motorcycle launch coaster MotoGee and Hype, a launched steel Sky Rocket II coaster, and family coaster Vauhtimato (&quot;Speedy Worm&quot;). The half-pipe coaster called Half Pipe was recently removed due to multiple reasons. Särkänniemi is owned by the city of Tampere and attracts over 600 000 visitors annually.

Särkänniemi is the biggest rival for Linnanmäki as the lead amusement park in Finland. Both are about the same size.
The park gave up the dolphinarium in 2016 and the dolphins were safely transported to Attica Zoological Park in Greece. The park has more than 30 rides and attractions. There are also two water rides in the park, a log flume called Tukkijoki and a river rapids called Koskiseikkailu. The roller coaster Trombi will be removed in autumn 2024.

In the future, a hotel and spa with restaurants and water experiences are planned around the amusement park, as well as new apartments. It is also possible to travel to the area by tram as part of the Tampere light rail network.

==History==
This multi-purpose park is owned by the city of Tampere and boasts a variety of rides as well as both Aquarium and Planetarium was opened in 1969, a children&#x27;s zoo that opened in 1970, a 168m tall Observation Tower that opened in 1971, The Sara Hilden Art Museum opened in 1979, and the Dolphinarium opened in 1985.

The amusement park aspect of Särkänniemi started in 1973 with the opening of Neulan Huvipuisto (Neula Amusement Park); in the beginning the park offered only a handful of children&#x27;s rides. In 1975 the city of Tampere took over the operations of the fun park and integrated it into other attractions on the peninsula.

The park is located on a peninsula, about a kilometre from the city centre of Tampere, that juts out into the Black Gulf. The area used to house three different breweries in the 18th century onward and in the 20th century a huge warehouse serving the log industry was built on the peninsula of Särkänniemi. These buildings were demolished in the 1960s.

The park is easily accessible by bus line 2 and tramway line 3.

<text>Leontopodium nivale, commonly called edelweiss ( ; or ), is a mountain flower belonging to the daisy or sunflower family Asteraceae. The plant prefers rocky limestone places at about altitude. It is a non-toxic plant. Its leaves and flowers are covered with dense hairs, which appear to protect the plant from cold, aridity, and ultraviolet radiation. It is a scarce, short-lived flower found in remote mountain areas and has been used as a symbol for alpinism, for rugged beauty and purity associated with the Alps and Carpathians. It is a national symbol of several countries, specifically Bulgaria, Austria, Slovenia, Switzerland, and Italy. In Romania it was declared a &quot;monument of nature&quot; in 1931. The Edelweiss day is celebrated on 5 March. According to folk tradition, giving this flower to a loved one is a promise of dedication.

==Names==
The flower&#x27;s common name is German (and or in Alemannic German), and is a compound of &quot;noble&quot; and &quot;white&quot;. The Slovene name is , meaning mountain girl. In Romanian, it is known as , which means &quot;cliff flower&quot;. The flower is referred to as in the Italian-speaking Alps and in the French Alps, meaning &quot;star of the Alps&quot;.

 was one of several regional names for the plant and achieved wide usage during the first half of the 19th century in the context of early Alpine tourism. Alternative names include (&quot;cat&#x27;s paws&quot;) and the older (&quot;wool flower,&quot; attested in Early New High German in the 16th century).

The scientific name &quot;Leontopodium&quot; is a latinisation of the Ancient Greek (), &quot;lion&#x27;s paw&quot; (Modern Greek borrows the German word). The Latin specific epithet &quot;&quot; means &quot;snow&quot; or &quot;snowy&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
Since 1822, &quot;Leontopodium&quot; has no longer been considered part of the genus &quot;Gnaphalium&quot;, but classified alongside it as a distinct genus within the tribe Gnaphalieae. In 2003, &quot;Leontopodium alpinum&quot; was re-classified as a subspecies of &quot;Leontopodium nivale&quot;. Thus, the alpine edelweiss is currently recognized as being divided into two subspecies, &quot;Leontopodium nivale&quot; subsp. &quot;alpinum&quot; and &quot;Leontopodium nivale&quot; subsp. &quot;nivale&quot;.

==Description==
The plant&#x27;s leaves and flowers are covered with white hairs, and appear woolly (tomentose). Flowering stalks of edelweiss can grow to a size of in the wild, or, up to in cultivation. Each bloom consists of five to six small yellow clustered spikelet-florets () surrounded by fuzzy white &quot;petals&quot; (technically, bracts) in a double-star formation. The flowers bloom between July and September.

==Habitat and distribution==

&quot;Leontopodium nivale&quot; prefers rocky limestone locations in the Alps, Pyrenees Mountains, and the Italian Apennines at about altitude.

==Conservation==

&quot;Leontopodium nivale&quot; is considered a least concern species by the IUCN. The population of this species declined due to overcollection, but is now protected by laws, ex situ conservation and occurrence in national parks.

==Cultivation==

&quot;Leontopodium nivale&quot; is grown in gardens for its interesting inflorescence and silver foliage. It grows in the end of May The plants are short lived and can be grown from seed.

==Chemical constituents==
Compounds of different classes, such as terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, fatty acids and polyacetylenes are reported in various parts of edelweiss plants. Leoligin was reported as the major lignan constituent.

The edelweiss has been used in traditional folk medicine in the Alps for centuries. Extracts from different parts of plants have been used to treat abdominal pain, respiratory diseases, heart disease, and against diarrhea. That is why it was also known as the bellyache flower for a long time. It was also used by the mountain people as a durable flower (&quot;eternal flower&quot;) in dry bouquets. The cosmetics industry became aware of the plant and its extracts a few years ago.

==Symbolic uses==
In the 19th century, the edelweiss became a symbol of the rugged purity of the Alpine region and of its native inhabitants.

The passion for edelweiss, which had previously been neglected, began in the middle of the 19th century. The focus is on an incident from 1856, when the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I went on a mountain hike to the Pasterzen Glacier on the Großglockner with his wife Sisi. There the emperor picked his wife an edelweiss from the steep rock with the words &quot;The first in my life that I picked myself&quot;. The affection for edelweiss was a common feature of the famous couple and this well-known story raised people&#x27;s attention to this alpine plant.

The plant became known as a symbol of the Austrian Empress Elisabeth. A portrait by the painter Franz Xaver Winterhalter painted in 1865 shows Empress Elisabeth with nine artificial edelweiss stars braided in her hair. The jewelry made of precious metal and diamonds was designed in the years after 1850 by the then court and chamber jeweler Alexander Emanuel Köchert.

With the rise of mountain tourism at the end of the 19th century, the edelweiss became the badge and symbol of alpinists and mountaineers. In order to prevent the extinction of the often picked symbolic species, it was placed under nature protection early on. The edelweiss was soon adopted as a symbol in the logo of numerous alpine clubs and associations. In the Austro-Hungarian Army in particular, the symbolic relationship between defiant, frugal and resilient alpine plants, and the required perseverance, agility and cutting edge of the alpine troops was recognized, emphasized, and often promoted by badges and designations. The Alpen-Edelweiss was assigned as a badge by Emperor Franz Joseph to troops (three regiments of &quot;Kaiserschützen&quot;) of the Austro-Hungarian Army intended for use in the mountains. It was worn on the collar of the uniform skirt.

In Berthold Auerbach&#x27;s novel &quot;Edelweiss&quot; (1861), the difficulty for an alpinist to acquire an edelweiss flower was exaggerated to the point of claiming: &quot;the possession of one is a proof of unusual daring.&quot; This idea at the time was becoming part of the popular mythology of early alpinism. Auerbach&#x27;s novel appeared in English translation in 1869, prefaced with a quote attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson:
Together with the alpine gentian, the edelweiss is also a symbol of lonely peaks and pure air in the Alps today. These plants are celebrated with songs and many souvenirs related to them are sold.

===Before 1914===

* The edelweiss was established in 1907 as the sign of the Imperial-Royal Mountain Troops by Emperor Franz Joseph I. These original three Regiments wore their edelweiss on the collar of their uniform. Before 1918 there were also innumerable edelweiss badges in the Habsburg army. These include, for example, the military mountain guide award (ice ax with edelweiss and winding mountain rope), edelweiss emblems on the collar and cap or badges from alpine patrol companies. Many alpine units, commandos and soldiers proudly wore unofficial edelweiss badges. 
* The edelweiss also played a role in the troop designation, which also reflected the special relationship with the mountains. In addition to the &quot;Edelweiss Corps&quot; (k.u.k. XIV. Corps) of Archduke Joseph Ferdinand, an &quot;Edelweiss Division&quot; was formed in the course of the First World War. It essentially consisted of Kaiserjäger of the 3rd and 4th regiments, the Salzburg infantry regiment &quot;Archduke Rainer&quot; No. 59 and the Upper Austrian infantry regiment &quot;Grand Duke of Hesse and the Rhine&quot; No. 14. In 1915, World War I, the edelweiss was granted to the German alpine troops for their bravery. Today, it is still the insignia of the Austrian, French, Slovenian, Polish, Romanian, and German alpine troops.
* In the Swiss Army, the highest ranks (brigadier general and higher) have badges in the form of edelweiss flowers, where other military branch badges would have stars.

<text>St. Albans School (STA) is an independent college preparatory day and boarding school for boys in grades 4–12, located in Washington, D.C. The school is named after Saint Alban, traditionally regarded as the first British martyr. Within the St. Albans community, the school is commonly referred to as &quot;S-T-A.&quot; 

The school enrolls approximately 590 day students in grades 4–12, and 30 additional boarding students in grades 9–12. It is affiliated with the National Cathedral School and the co-ed Beauvoir, the National Cathedral Elementary School, all of which are located on the grounds of the Washington National Cathedral. All the affiliated schools named are members of the Protestant Episcopal Cathedral Foundation.

==History==

The school was founded in 1909, with $300,000 ($7.2 million in 2015 dollars) in funding bequeathed by Harriet Lane Johnston, niece of President James Buchanan. Initially, it was a school for boy choristers to the Washington National Cathedral, a program that the school continues today.

The school opened its new Upper School building, Marriott Hall, in 2009–2010. The firm Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill designed the building, which received considerable media attention.

<text>Näsijärvi () is a lake above sea level, in the Pirkanmaa region of southern Finland. Näsijärvi is the biggest lake in the Tampere area at in size. The city of Tampere was built along the Tammerkoski rapids, through which the lake drains into Pyhäjärvi. The water quality of the lake has improved as forest industry has decreased the amount of waste water.

The lake is divided into three fjards: Näsinselkä, Koljonselkä and Vankavesi. Näsinselkä starts in the south from Tampere, where it expands to the west as Lielahti and to the east as Aitolahti. At the end of Aitolahti, it expands into a small Niihamanselkä, from which Olkahistenlahti diverges to the southeast and Merjanlahti and Laalahti to the northeast. To the north of Lielahti and Lentävänniemi is Siivikkalanlahti and behind it Ryydynpohja. Näsinselkä changes to Koljonselkä in the north after the Iso-Otava Island. In the case of the islands, a wide headland protrudes from the east towards the lake, the southern tip of which is called Paavolanniemi. To the northeast, there is the five-kilometer-long Tervalahti with its bay Uskalinlahti. On the opposite shore of Näsinselkä is Laakonselkä, a bay that is more than four kilometers long and tapering. Between Koljonselkä and Vankavesi is an archipelago, to the south of which the lake is crossed by the terminal moraine of the Inner Finland.

There are boat cruising services on Näsijärvi. In 1929, the steamer SS Kuru suffered the most severe Finnish inland shipping disaster on Näsijärvi.

During the winter, usually during February and March, the lake is frozen in its entirety. Näsijärvi is then used for Nordic walking, cross-country skiing, and everyday pleasure walking. There is a small, rocky island upon which a lighthouse, called , is located; it is the most popular walking destination on the lake.

In the north Näsijärvi has a wide catchment area that includes among others the lakes Ruovesi, Kuorevesi, Keurusselkä, Tarjanne, Pihlajavesi, Toisvesi and Ähtärinjärvi.

<text>William Maclure (27 October 176323 March 1840) was an Americanized Scottish geologist, cartographer and philanthropist. He is known as the &#x27;father of American geology&#x27;. As a social experimenter on new types of community life, he collaborated with British social reformer Robert Owen, (1771–1854), in Indiana, United States.

Maclure had a highly successful mercantile career, making a fortune that allowed him to retire in 1797 at the early age of 34 to pursue his scientific, geological and other interests. In 1809 he made the earliest attempt at a geological map of the United States of America.

==Biography==

===Early life, business, and education===
Maclure was born in 1763 in Ayr, Scotland.

After a brief visit to New York City in 1782, he began work with the merchants Miller, Hart &amp; Co, who traded and shipped goods to and from America. Maclure was based in the London office but regularly travelled to France and Ireland on business. In 1796 business affairs took him to Virginia, which he thereafter made his home. 
In 1803 he visited France as one of the commissioners appointed to settle the claims of American citizens on the French government; and during the few years then spent in Europe he applied himself with enthusiasm to the study of geology.
While residing in Switzerland, he became impressed with what is now called the Pestalozzi School System, from Swiss pedagogist Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746–1827).

===Geological map===
Maclure visit to Spain in 1808; this visit ended abruptly by the outbreak of the Peninsular War. After his return home in 1808 he commenced the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States. Almost every state in the Union was traversed and mapped by him, the Allegheny Mountains being crossed and recrossed some 50 times. The results of his unaided labours were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled &quot;Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map&quot;, and published in the Society&#x27;s Transactions, together with the first geological map of that country, Maclure&#x27;s 1809 Geological Map. This antedates William Smith&#x27;s geological map of England and Wales (with part of Scotland) by six years, although it was constructed using a different classification of rocks.
In 1812, while in France, Maclure became a member of the newly founded Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP). In 1817 Maclure became president of the ANSP, a post he held for the next 22 years.

In 1817, while residing in Europe, Maclure brought before the same society a revised edition of his map, and his great geological memoir, which he had issued separately, with some additional matter, under the title &quot;Observations on the Geology of the United States of America&quot;. Subsequent surveys have corroborated the general accuracy of Maclure&#x27;s observations.

===Later years===
In 1820 he visited Spain, because since the restoration of the Constitution in July 1820, Spain was the only liberal country in Europe. He attempted to establish an agricultural college near the city of Alicante, but en 1823 the invasion of the French army, the Hundred Thousand Sons of Sait Louis, imposed absolutism again and in May 2, 1824, he abandoned Alicante. Returning to America in 1824, he settled for some years at New Harmony, Indiana, seeking to develop his vision of the agricultural college. Failing health ultimately required him to relinquish the attempt and to seek (in 1827) a more congenial climate in Mexico. There, in 1840, at San Ángel, he died aged 77. His will provided for a trust fund consisting of most of his property. Under the terms of the Trust, 160 workingmen&#x27;s libraries were established. The treatment of Maclure&#x27;s burial site in Mexico was bereft of the honors due the respected humanitarian and geologist:

*Summary of the second phase of Maclure&#x27;s life (after Moore 1947) 

==New Harmony==
The New Harmony commune in Indiana produced a number of geologists, naturalists, and botanists which were influenced by Maclure, such as the siblings Robert Dale Owen (1801–1877), social reformer; David Dale Owen (1807–1860), geologist, artist; Jane Dale Owen Fauntleroy (1806–1861), educator; and Richard Dale Owen (1810–1890) geologist, first president of Purdue University, Lafayette, Indiana. They interacted there with a formidable crop of contemporary geologists, social reformers, botanists, paleobotanists, ethnologists, civil engineers, etc.

<doc id="418589" wikidata="Q549884" url="?curid=418589" title="Hugo Award for Best Novella">
<text>The Hugo Award for Best Novella is one of the Hugo Awards given each year for science fiction or fantasy stories published or translated into English during the previous calendar year. The novella award is available for works of fiction of between 17,500 and 40,000 words; awards are also given out in the short story, novelette and novel categories. The Hugo Awards have been described as &quot;a fine showcase for speculative fiction&quot; and &quot;the best known literary award for science fiction writing&quot;.

The Hugo Award for Best Novella has been awarded annually since 1968. In addition to the regular Hugo Awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given. Retro Hugos may only be awarded for years after 1939 in which no awards were originally given. To date, Retro Hugo awards have been given for novellas for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954.

During the 65 nomination years, 189 authors have had works nominated; 47 of these have won, including coauthors and Retro Hugos. One translator has been noted along with the author of a novella written in a language other than English: Alex Woodend, in 2024, for translations of two works from Chinese. Connie Willis has received the most Hugos for Best Novella at four out of eight nominations. Willis and Charles Stross at three out of four nominations, and Robert A. Heinlein at three out of six nominations for Retro Hugos, are the only authors to have won more than twice. Seanan McGuire has earned nine nominations, the most of any author; Robert Silverberg has earned eight, Nancy Kress seven, and Heinlein, George R. R. Martin, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Lucius Shepard six, the only authors besides Willis to get more than five. Robinson has the highest number of nominations without winning.

==Selection==
Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by the supporting and attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. These novellas on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of stories that can be nominated. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year&#x27;s Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations. Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year. Members are permitted to vote &quot;no award&quot;, if they feel that none of the nominees is deserving of the award that year, and in the case that &quot;no award&quot; takes the majority the Hugo is not given in that category. This happened in the Best Novella category in 2015.

== Winners and nominees ==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novella was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot;. Entries with a yellow background have won the award; those with a grey background are the nominees on the short-list. If the novella was originally published in a book with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine, the book title is included after the publisher&#x27;s name.

=== Retro Hugos ===
Beginning with the 1996 Worldcon, the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years before the current year, if no awards were originally given that year. Retro Hugos have been awarded eight times, for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954.

<doc id="418591" wikidata="Q373097" url="?curid=418591" title="John Michell">
<text>John Michell (; 25 December 1724 – 21 April 1793) was an English natural philosopher and clergyman who provided pioneering insights into a wide range of scientific fields including astronomy, geology, optics, and gravitation. Considered &quot;one of the greatest unsung scientists of all time&quot;, he is the first person known to have proposed the existence of stellar bodies comparable to black holes, and the first to have suggested that earthquakes travelled in (seismic) waves. Recognizing that double stars were a product of mutual gravitation, he was the first to apply statistics to the study of the cosmos. He invented an apparatus to measure the mass of the Earth, and explained how to manufacture an artificial magnet. He has been called the father both of seismology and of magnetometry.

According to one science journalist, &quot;a few specifics of Michell&#x27;s work really do sound like they are ripped from the pages of a twentieth century astronomy textbook.&quot; The American Physical Society (APS) described Michell as being &quot;so far ahead of his scientific contemporaries that his ideas languished in obscurity, until they were re-invented more than a century later&quot;. The Society stated that while &quot;he was one of the most brilliant and original scientists of his time, Michell remains virtually unknown today, in part because he did little to develop and promote his own path-breaking ideas&quot;.

==Early life, education and professional positions==
John Michell was born in 1724 in Eakring, in Nottinghamshire, the son of Gilbert Michell, a priest, and Obedience Gerrard. Gilbert was the son of William Michell and Mary Taylor of Kenwyn, Cornwall; Obedience was the daughter of Ralph and Hannah Gerrard of London. He was educated at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, and later became a Fellow of Queens&#x27;. The family was of Cornish origins. He obtained his M.A. degree in 1752, and his B.D. degree in 1761. He was Tutor of the college from 1751 to 1763; Praelector in Arithmetic in 1751; Censor in Theology in 1752; Praelector in Geometry in 1753; Praelector in Greek in 1755 and 1759; Senior Bursar in 1756; Praelector in Hebrew in 1759 and 1762; Censor in Philosophy and Examiner in 1760. &quot;He was nominated Rector of St Botolph&#x27;s, Cambridge, on 28 March 1760, and held this living until June 1763.&quot; From 1762 to 1764, he held the Woodwardian Chair of Geology until he was obliged to relinquish it on his marriage.

There is no surviving portrait of Michell; he is said to have been &quot;a little short Man, of a black Complexion, and fat but having no Acquaintance with him, can say little of him. I think he had the care of St. Botolph&#x27;s Church Cambridge, while he continued Fellow of Queens’ College, where he was esteemed a very ingenious Man, and an excellent Philosopher. He has published some things in that way, on the Magnet and Electricity.&quot;

In 1910, Sir Edmund Whittaker observed that during the century after Isaac Newton&#x27;s death, &quot;the only natural philosopher of distinction who lived and taught at Cambridge was Michell&quot;, although his &quot;researches seem to have attracted little or no attention among his collegiate contemporaries and successors, who silently acquiesced when his discoveries were attributed to others, and allowed his name to perish entirely from Cambridge tradition&quot;. Michell proceeded to take up clerical positions in Compton and then Havant, both in Hampshire. During this period he unsuccessfully sought positions at Cambridge, and as Astronomer Royal.

In 1767, he was appointed rector of St. Michael&#x27;s Church of Thornhill, near Leeds, Yorkshire, England, a post he held for the rest of his life. He did most of his important scientific work in Thornhill, where he died on 21 April 1793, aged 68. He is buried there. After local pressure, a blue plaque went up on the church wall to commemorate him.

==Scientific work==
In 1750, Michell published at Cambridge a work of some eighty pages entitled &quot;A Treatise of Artificial Magnets&quot;, in which he presented an easy and expeditious method of producing magnets that are superior to the best natural magnets. Besides the description of the method of magnetization which still bears his name, this work contains a variety of accurate observations about magnetism, and features a lucid exposition of the nature of magnetic induction.

At one point, Michell attempted to measure the radiation pressure of light by focusing sunlight onto one side of a compass needle. The experiment was not a success: the needle melted.

===Geology and seismology===
Until the late 20th century Michell was considered important primarily because of his work on geology. His most important geological essay, written after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, was entitled &quot;Conjectures concerning the Cause and Observations upon the Phaenomena of Earthquakes&quot; (&quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, li. 1760). In this paper he introduced the idea that earthquakes spread out as waves through the Earth, and that they involve the offsets in geological strata now known as faults. He was able to estimate both the epicentre and the focus of the Lisbon earthquake, and may also have been the first to suggest that a tsunami is caused by a submarine earthquake.

Michell&#x27;s essay not only provided insights on earthquakes but also, more broadly, represented an advance in the understanding of the geology of the Earth&#x27;s crust. He recognized that the Earth is composed &quot;of regular and uniform strata&quot;, some of which have been interrupted by upheavals. &quot;The most important part of Michell&#x27;s Earthquake paper&quot;, in the view of one commentator, &quot;is the account which it contains of what is now known as &#x27;the crust of the Earth.&#x27;&quot; Exhibiting a remarkable knowledge of the geological strata in various parts of England and abroad, he drew on his own observations to advance the understanding of sedimentary stratigraphy and was the first to define the Mesozoic stratigraphy in the U.K.

In 1760, as a result of this work, he was elected a member of the Royal Society.

A 1788 letter to Henry Cavendish indicated that Michell continued to be interested in geology several decades after his paper on earthquakes.

===Magnetism===
Michell studied magnetism and discovered that the magnetic force exerted by each pole of a magnet decreases according to an inverse-square law, i.e. in proportion to the square of the distance between them. His 1750 paper &quot;Treatise of Artificial Magnets&quot;, which was written for seamen and instrument makers and intended as a practical manual on how to make magnets, included a list of the &quot;Properties of Magnetical Bodies&quot; that represented a major contribution to the understanding of magnetism.

===Gravity===

Michell devised a torsion balance for measuring the mass of the Earth, but died before he could use it. His instrument passed into the hands of his lifelong friend Henry Cavendish, who first performed in 1798 the experiment now known as the Cavendish Experiment. Placing two 1-kg lead balls at the ends of a six-foot rod, he suspended the rod horizontally by a fibre attached to its centre. Then he placed a massive lead ball beside each of the small ones, causing a gravitational attraction that led the rod to turn clockwise. By measuring the rod&#x27;s movement, Cavendish was able to calculate the force exerted by each of the large balls on the 1-kg balls. From these calculations, he was able to provide an accurate estimate of the gravitational constant and of the mass and average density of the Earth. Cavendish gave Michell full credit for his accomplishment.

In 1987, gravity researcher A. H. Cook wrote:

The most important advance in experiments on gravitation and other delicate measurements was the introduction of the torsion balance by Michell and its use by Cavendish. It has been the basis of all the most significant experiments on gravitation ever since.

===Double stars===
Michell was the first person to apply the new mathematics of statistics to the study of the stars, and demonstrated in a 1767 paper that many more stars occur in pairs or groups than a perfectly random distribution could account for. He focused his investigation on the Pleiades cluster, and calculated that the likelihood of finding such a close grouping of stars was about one in half a million. He concluded that the stars in these double or multiple star systems might be drawn to one another by gravitational pull, thus providing the first evidence for the existence of binary stars and star clusters. His work on double stars may have influenced his friend William Herschel&#x27;s research on the same topic.

===Black holes===
In a paper for the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London&quot;, read on 27 November 1783, Michell was the first to propose the existence of celestial bodies similar to black holes. Having accepted Newton&#x27;s corpuscular theory of light, which posited that light consists of minuscule particles, he reasoned that such particles, when emanated by a star, would be slowed down by its gravitational pull, and that it might therefore be possible to determine the star&#x27;s mass based on the reduction in speed. This insight led in turn to the recognition that a star&#x27;s gravitational pull might be so strong that the escape velocity would exceed the speed of light. Michell calculated that this would be the case with a star more than 500 times the size of the Sun. Since light would not be able to escape such a star, it would be invisible. In his own words:

Michell suggested that there might be many such objects in the universe, and today astronomers believe that black holes do indeed exist at the centers of most galaxies. Similarly, Michell proposed that astronomers could detect them by looking for star systems which behaved gravitationally like two stars, but where only one star could be seen. Michell argued that this would show the presence of a star from which light was not escaping. It was an extraordinarily accurate prediction. All of the dozen candidate stellar black holes in our galaxy (the Milky Way) are in X-ray compact binary systems.

Michell&#x27;s ideas about gravity and light interested William Herschel, who tried to test them with his powerful telescopes. A few years after Michell came up with the concept of invisible, light-trapping stars, the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace suggested essentially the same idea in his 1796 book, &quot;Exposition du Système du Monde&quot;.

It has been written that Michell was so far ahead of his time in regard to black holes that the idea &quot;made little impression&quot; on his contemporaries. &quot;He died in quiet obscurity&quot;, states the American Physical Society, &quot;and his notion of a &#x27;dark star&#x27; was forgotten until his writings re-surfaced in the 1970s.&quot;

===Telescopes===
Michell constructed telescopes for his own use. One of them, a reflecting telescope with a 10-foot focal length and a 30-inch aperture, was bought by the distinguished astronomer William Herschel after Michell&#x27;s death. The two men had many interests in common, and exchanged letters at least twice, but only one record suggests that they ever met. Herschel recorded having visited and seen Michell&#x27;s telescope while in the area in 1792; Michell was already frail, and his telescope was in disrepair. Herschel bought the telescope the following year, for £30.

==Other professional activities==

Michell also wrote a paper on surveying that his biographer has described as &quot;elegant&quot; in theory. 
Michell was elected a member of the Royal Society. He was first invited to meetings of the Royal Society in 1751 as a guest of Sir George Savile, who would become his patron. He later attended meetings &quot;one to four times a year&quot;, while at Cambridge. His paper on the cause of earthquakes was read before the Society beginning on 28 February 1760, leading to a recommendation by Savile and another member that Michell be invited to join the Society. He was elected a member on 12 June 1760.

Michell followed his work in seismology with work in astronomy, and after publishing his findings in 1767 he served on an astronomical committee of the Royal Society.

More recently, Michell has become known for his letter to Cavendish, published in 1784, on the effect of gravity on light. This paper was rediscovered in the 1970s and is now recognised as anticipating several astronomical ideas that had been considered to be 20th century innovations. Michell is now credited with being the first to study the case of a heavenly object massive enough to prevent light from escaping (the concept of escape velocity was well known at the time). Such an object, often referred to as a dark star, would not be directly visible, but could be identified by the motions of a companion star if it was part of a binary system. The classical minimum radius for escape assuming light behaved like particles of matter is numerically equal to the Schwarzschild Radius in general relativity. Michell also suggested using a prism to measure what is now known as gravitational redshift, the gravitational weakening of starlight due to the surface gravity of the source. Michell acknowledged that some of these ideas were not technically practical at the time, but wrote that he hoped they would be useful to future generations. By the time that Michell&#x27;s paper was rediscovered nearly two centuries later, these ideas had been reinvented by others.

==Personal life==
Michell was a man of &quot;wide latitude in religious belief&quot;. He was described by a contemporary as &quot;a little short man, of black complexion, and fat&quot;, and was &quot;esteemed a very ingenious Man, and an excellent Philosopher.&quot; During his years at Thornhill, he welcomed visitors including Benjamin Franklin, Joseph Priestley, Jan Ingenhousz, and Henry Cavendish (the discoverer of hydrogen). Michell wrote to Franklin in 1767 describing his first visit to Thornhill, &quot;the place I told you I was going to remove to&quot;.

Priestley lived in nearby Birstall for a time. It was at Michell&#x27;s rectory opposite the church that Priestley and Ingenhousz met for the first time. At the same meeting John Smeaton was introduced to Benjamin Franklin and together they viewed the canal that Smeaton had just finished constructing nearby. Michell also helped Smeaton revise his book on the Eddystone Lighthouse.

Michell&#x27;s first wife was Sarah Williamson (1727–1765), daughter of Luke Williamson and Sutton Holmes, &quot;a young lady of considerable fortune&quot;, whom he married in 1764 and who unfortunately died only a year later, in 1765. On 13 February 1773, in Newark, Nottinghamshire, he married Ann Brecknock (1736-1805), daughter of Matthew and Ann Brecknock of Nottinghamshire. They had one child, Mary, who married Sir Thomas Turton of Leeds, son of William Turton Esq. of Kingston Lisle, Berkshire, and Jane Clarke of Hertford, Hertfordshire.

Michell&#x27;s younger brother Gilbert was a merchant in London who later lived with Michell in Thornhill, where the two brothers were active in local real estate, purchasing many properties in the West Riding of Yorkshire.

<text>The red-fronted serin or fire-fronted serin (Serinus pusillus) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It prefers high mountain regions and is long.

This bird breeds in the Caucasus and the higher mountains of Turkey and Iran, with vagrants occasionally reaching the Greek Eastern Aegean Islands in winter. This bird is also found in Ladakh and other parts of the Indian Himalayas. Outside the breeding season, it occurs in small flocks, typically seen searching through thistle patches. It is a popular cagebird, and escapees from captivity are occasionally found throughout Europe.

The bird is variable in plumage, with adults resembling very dark redpolls. The foreparts are sooty and the forehead is red; juveniles have buff-brown heads. The call is a rapid, shrill &quot;titihihihihihi&quot;, resembling that of a Linnet.

The bird will breed in captivity and thrives on a diet of canary grass seed, millet, and other small seeds. They bathe daily if water is accessible.

<doc id="418594" wikidata="Q1470373" url="?curid=418594" title="Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles (video game)">
<text>is an action role-playing video game developed by The Game Designers Studio and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. It was released in 2003 in Japan and 2004 in North America, Europe and Australia. A remastered version for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Android, and iOS was released in August 2020. A spin-off of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series and beginning of the series of the same name, &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; was the first title in the franchise to be released for a Nintendo home console since &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; in 1994.

Players take on the role of adventurers who travel in a caravan gathering mystical fuel for crystals which protect the world&#x27;s settlements from the destructive &quot;Miasma&quot;. The single-player campaign has the player escort the vessel carrying the crystal&#x27;s energy, defending it from enemies and solving puzzles to progress. Multiplayer, which uses Game Boy Advance units connected using the console&#x27;s link cable, has up to four players protecting the vessel.

Deciding to partner with Nintendo for game development following severe financial problems created by the failure of &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;, franchise creator Square formed the Game Designers Studio as a shell company to develop for Nintendo hardware without impacting games for Sony platforms. The development team wanted to create an accessible gameplay experience focusing on multiplayer. The music, written by Kumi Tanioka, made extensive use of medieval and Renaissance musical instruments.

Upon release, the title was positively received by journalists, and was nominated for multiple awards. Reaching high sales positions in Japan and the West, it went on to sell over one million copies worldwide. The remastered version saw generally mixed reviews, with many faulting the change to online-only multiplayer, and by-then dated gameplay mechanics. Subsequent entries in the &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; series have released for Nintendo consoles, beginning with &quot;Ring of Fates&quot; for the Nintendo DS.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&quot; is an action role-playing game where players take control of a group of adventurers who travel the world searching for rare trees which produce &quot;myrrh&quot;, used to fuel crystals protecting the world&#x27;s settlements from the poisonous Miasma. Players are guided through a repeating series of events which dictate their progress through the game and its story. The adventurers set out from their village, travelling to the trees guarding the vessel which gathers the myrrh, exploring dungeons in which the trees reside, then returning home to renew their village&#x27;s protective crystal.

Players choose their avatar character from one of four races; they can be male or female, each with four pre-set body types. Each race has specific strengths, such as the human-like Clavats having high defence and magic statistics and the nomadic Selkies being able to use special abilities with less cooldown time. Each character&#x27;s attributes are further customised by choosing the profession of their family, which gives the character access to unique facilities and items each time they return to their home town. Players navigate the world map with their Caravan, and enter town and dungeon environments discovered during the journey. In towns, the player can freely explore and use the available facilities to create and upgrade both items and equipment using materials and blueprints gathered during their journey. The player can also encounter other caravans and travellers, triggering story events. Items used to support the player are both bought in shops and received as gifts from the player character&#x27;s family.

While exploring dungeons, players are confined to a safe zone created by the vessel, fighting enemies in a style similar to hack and slash games with actions assigned to command buttons; actions can be chained together into short combination attacks using equipped weapons to increase damage and charge up magic abilities. Magic can be used to damage enemies or trigger status ailments, with multiple spells able to fuse and create new effects in battle. The elemental affinity of the player&#x27;s attacks can be changed using crystals found in dungeons. Certain elemental affinities are necessary for crossing into new zones otherwise blocked by streams of Miasma. Instead of an experience point system, character attributes and statistics are increased by completing challenges in each dungeon session which award skill points, and Artifacts found in dungeons which can be equipped to a character.

In single-player, the player controls one character guarding the Moogle-held vessel from monster attacks while navigating dungeons. The game&#x27;s multiplayer allows up to four players to join in a local gameplay session; multiplayer relies on the GameCube console linking with the Game Boy Advance (GBA) link cable. All players are displayed on the screen, while their GBAs both control their characters and allow functions such as shopping in towns and performing battle functions. Character attributes are increased in the same way, except that the necessary points are given to the best player during that session. In battle, players can raise attack meters using standard attacks in succession, and combine individual spells to create more powerful versions for higher damage. The link cable can also be used in single player, allowing the GBA to be used both as a controller and a second screen displaying radar information. The type of radar and what it shows is determined by the color the player&#x27;s Moogle—one of a recurring &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; race—is painted during stays in towns and visits to the adventurers&#x27; hometown.

==Plot==
&quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; takes place in an unnamed fantasy world inhabited by four races. The player takes control of a caravan hailing from the village of Tipa, in which members of the world&#x27;s four races come together to help its mission. 1000 years before the game&#x27;s events, the world&#x27;s sustaining Great Crystal was shattered by a meteorite carrying an alien lifeform called the Meteor Parasite. The Parasite generated a poisonous vapour called the Miasma, which kills anyone it touches. Fragments of the Great Crystal ward off the Miasma from surviving settlements, but require renewal using myrrh, an energy harvested from magical trees using magical vessels protected by dedicated caravans. The Tipa caravanners go on missions across the world to gather myrrh, learning the world&#x27;s history from travellers and characters found in other settlements.

The caravanners eventually reach the home of the Carbuncles, an ancient race who guided the world&#x27;s races to the Great Crystal fragments before going into hiding. After hearing of their adventures, the Carbuncles direct the caravanners to the source of the Miasma, asking them to destroy the Meteor Parasite. The caravanners fight the Meteor Parasite, but before they can kill it are transported to an unknown realm. There they meet Mio and her evil counterpart Raem, metaphysical beings born following the Great Crystal&#x27;s destruction. Raem attacks the caravanners, merging with Mio to increase his power, before being finally destroyed. Mio and Raem separate and fade away, then the caravanners are sent back to Mount Vellenge to destroy the wounded Meteor Parasite. The world is freed from the Miasma—allowing the four tribes to begin rebuilding civilisation—and the caravanners return home.

==Development==
&quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; was the first original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; title to be developed for a Nintendo console since the release of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; in 1994. &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; developer Square had broken with Nintendo in 1996 to develop &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and future mainline entries in the series for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation platforms, resulting in a long-standing enmity between Square and Nintendo. In 2001, following the financial failure of the feature film &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;, Sony purchased a stake in the company amounting to 19% of shares. After considering their still-poor financial situation and wishing to keep their staff from leaving, Square decided to begin developing titles for Nintendo consoles once again. Sony, whose rivalry with Nintendo had softened with the appearance of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox on the console market, agreed to the partnership on the condition that it would not impact development of titles for the PlayStation 2. This resulted in the creation of &quot;The Game Designers Studio&quot;, a shell company for Square&#x27;s Product Development Division 2 co-owned by Square and Akitoshi Kawazu, a staff member famous for his work on the &quot;SaGa&quot; series.

Development of the new project began in late 2001. The title was developed with the aid of Q Fund, a fund set up by Nintendo&#x27;s Hiroshi Yamauchi to help first-time developers for the GameCube and GBA consoles. Kawazu acted as the game&#x27;s producer. The director was Kazuhiko Aoki, a veteran of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series who had worked on &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;. The artwork and character designs were created by Toshiyuki Itahana, who had also worked on &quot;IX&quot;. During the game&#x27;s development in 2003, Square underwent a merger with Enix to become Square Enix, though the nature of the merger meant operations at the Gamer Designers Studio continued as normal. Square Localization Specialist Aziz Hinoshita stated that the game was originally meant to be an offshoot of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, and once the series was established it would drop the connection to that series and would be called &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot;. It was the only title ever developed by the company for the GameCube.

Similar to his &quot;SaGa&quot; games, Kawazu wanted to promote player freedom. The basic concept was to build a game around use of the link cable. Kawazu explained that using the GBA would &quot;introduce different elements of gameplay&quot;. He later stated that this type of multiplayer meant &quot;the entry was a bit high&quot; for potential players. The battle system was initially going to use the series&#x27; recurring Active Time Battle system, but instead chose a purely action-based system to allow more people to enjoy the gameplay. Leveling based on experience points was also removed to create a level field for players. It was initially planned to include a human sidekick character, but upon considering its impact on multiplayer, they changed it to the current Moogle system.

The game&#x27;s event planner was Masahiro Kataoka, a Square staff member who had previously worked in that capacity on &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;. The central plot details of the Miasma and role of Crystals were established early on, based around the wish to keep players together. Each race&#x27;s defining traits were influenced by the designers&#x27; decisions about their combat options, with story-based additions coming from the planners later in production. The narrations which accompanied new areas were written in the style of journal entries, designed to both fit the theme of a caravan and introduce a new area to the player. While previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games were driven by their narrative, &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; was driven by its gameplay; the narrative was instead communicated through basic storytelling and environmental narrative. Despite this shift, recurring elements from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; were included. The many encounters players had along the way were important to Kawazu, with the scenario designers &quot;pushing themselves as far as they could&quot; to fill the game world with these encounters and accompanying lore. Most of them were created well after production had begun.

Itahana heard about the project while he was attached to &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; during its early production, and transferred over to work on &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot;. The scenario was already decided upon, with Itahana working from their briefs. A recurring theme in his artwork was the phrase &quot;Memento mori&quot;. The four races were designed to have distinct sillouettes, so players would not get confused. Itahana originally created a cat-like race for the game, but Kawazu &quot;hated&quot; their design, so he created the plant-themed Lilties as a replacement. His work on the game lacked strong character designs due to the online multiplayer nature of the title. The player character designs were intended to be highly distinctive, allowing players to differentiate each other during play sessions. When creating the graphics, the team created graphical effects they considered possible only on the GameCube, and constantly checked background designs throughout development. Due to the multitude of elements new to &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; being incorporated into &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot;, the development team faced multiple difficulties.

===Music===

The soundtrack to &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; was primarily composed by Kumi Tanioka, while music programmer and arranger Hidenori Iwasaki provided one additional piece of music. Prior to &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot;, Tanioka had worked on the score of &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;. Beginning work on the score in 2002, Tanioka and Iwasaki decided to exclusively use period instruments. The soundtrack makes extensive use of many medieval and Renaissance musical instruments such as the recorder, the crumhorn and the lute, creating a distinctively rustic feel. Tanioka said that the idea came to her while looking at illustrations of the game world, which gave her the idea of making &quot;world music&quot;, where the tracks would &quot;not [be] limited to a single country or culture&quot;. She also credits Iwasaki with doing &quot;fantastic technical work&quot; that brought her vision to life. The live music was performed by the Roba Music Theater, whom Iwasaki and Tanioka had seen perform. In addition to performing, the musicians made suggestions about the use of instruments.

The game features two vocal themes; the opening theme &quot;Kaze no Ne&quot;, and the ending theme &quot;Hoshizukiyo&quot;. Tanioka originally composed a longer version of &quot;Kaze no Ne&quot;, but to keep the opening at a reasonable length she had to shorten it. The Japanese versions are sung by Yae Fujimoto, while the English versions are sung by Donna Burke. Burke also provided narration for the English version of the game. The lyrics for both &quot;Kaze no Ne&quot; and &quot;Hoshizukiyo&quot; were written by Kataoka. Describing her localization of the songs, Burke felt it was a challenge as Japanese is a more compact language than English, meaning she needed to &quot;pad [the lyrics] out about 30-40%&quot;. Rather than a direct adaptation, Burke&#x27;s work carried a similar message using altered words.

A soundtrack album was released under the Pony Canyon label on August 20, 2003. It included all of the music from the game with the exception of the English versions of &quot;Kaze no Ne&quot; and &quot;Hoshizukiyo&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: A Musical Journey&quot; was a European promotional album which was given alongside the game on March 11, 2004 as a pre-order bonus. It contains six tracks from the soundtrack, including &quot;Kaze No Ne&quot; in both Japanese and English, the only time the English version has been released. It was published by Nintendo of Europe. &quot;Kaze no Ne&quot; was released as a single by Pony Canyon, featuring &quot;Kaze No Ne&quot;, an arranged version, and two other songs by Yae from her album &quot;Blue Line&quot;. The single was released on July 30, 2003.

==Release==
The game was officially announced at the Jump Festa event in Japan in December 2002. A Western release was announced in April the following year. The game was among those shown by Square Enix at the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo, alongside a number of other titles including &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; and &quot;X-2&quot;, and other titles including &quot;Unlimited SaGa&quot; and &quot;Drakengard&quot;. &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; was released in Japan on August 8, 2003, after being delayed twice. The game came packaged with a GameCube-GBA link cable for use in multiplayer. In North America, the game was released on February 9, 2004, in Europe on March 12, and Australia on March 19. The game was published worldwide by Nintendo.

===&quot;Remastered Edition&quot;===
A remastered version, titled &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Remastered Edition&quot;, was released in 2020. The remaster includes enhanced graphics, new and arranged music, thirteen new dungeons, voice acting, and cross-platform online multiplayer. The game was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Android, and iOS mobile platforms. The port&#x27;s online engine environment, dubbed STRIX Engine, was licensed from &quot;Fantasy Earth Zero&quot; developer SoftGear. Originally scheduled for a release in January 2020, it was delayed past the original planned release so the development team could further polish the game. The game was released online worldwide on August 27. A physical cartridge for Nintendo Switch was released only in Japan. A free downloadable Lite Version, acting as a demo covering three dungeons, was released alongside the retail version. Players of the Lite Version can join multiplayer sessions with retail version owners, allowing them to experience all thirteen dungeons. The Lite Version was developed late in full production, when the majority of the remaster was in place.

Producer and director Ryoma Araki talked with senior staff about remastering older games after finishing work on another project. Araki had joined Square Enix originally after seeing &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot;, and so when the chance came he expressed his wish to revive the game for a modern generation. While they had the option to remake it, Araki wanted to keep the game faithful to the memories of earlier players, both evoking nostalgia and assuring them that &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; was returning unchanged. Itahana returned, creating new lead character designs, but due to positive fan memories the original player designs were kept intact. Itahana worked on the new designs with Rubi Asami, who had previously worked on &quot;Mobius Final Fantasy&quot;.

Araki estimated that around half the game had been remade rather than remastered due to the number of changes and additions. When consulting Aoki and Kawazu, Araki was asked to keep the project faithful to its roots and update it for modern players. In addition to enhancing the graphics, the team improved the AI character behavior. Along with the new features, many of the changes were small adjustments done to increase its playability for a modern audience. One of these changes was the timing system for casting magic, which was adjusted to both work through an online connection and be more lenient on players than the original version. The mimic mechanic, which allows players to appear as characters met during the story, was implemented as a way for players to continue travelling with favorite characters without breaking the narrative flow. Unlike the original, the remaster does not support local multiplayer. During production, the team had to choose between local and online co-op rather than having both, so they opted for online to allow the maximum number of people to play. Commenting on the delays, Araki said the team were prioritising a smooth playing experience, but he ended up being &quot;reprimanded by a lot of important people&quot;.

Composer Hidenori Iwasaki was brought in to both compose new tunes and arrange the original themes, though this was originally unplanned. The remaster was planned to use the original score, but the team&#x27;s passion for the project prompted the decision to also remaster the music tracks. Remastering the old score was very easy as the original sound files had been kept in &quot;perfect condition&quot;. While they worked on the game for a year, remastering the original score took only three months. New themes were composed by Tanioka, who had become a freelance composer and performer in 2010. In order to recall her feelings to create new tracks, Tanioka listened to the original soundtrack. While the new themes were mainly for the additional dungeons, other tracks were incorporated into the rest of the game. The new boss battle theme, while more energetic and modern-sounding than the original score, was written in the same style as Tanioka&#x27;s earlier work. Fujimoto and Burke both returned to record new versions of the opening and ending themes. Burke enjoyed redoing the English theme, as she had gained more depth and experience since the original release.

==Reception==

Japanese gaming magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; praised the game&#x27;s fairytale aesthetic and unconventional treatment of the RPG genre; journalists Shane Bettenhausen, Jennifer Tsao and Kevin Gifford &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; each gave the game high praise for its innovation in gameplay and graphical style. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Rob Fahey gave the game a near-perfect score, noting the clear production values and calling it &quot;one of the best action RPGs&quot; he played; his only major fault was the implementation of multiplayer and its potential problems.

Andrew Reiner—writing for &quot;Game Informer&quot;—was highly critical of the overall experience, calling the game &quot;an experiment gone awry [...] unfit to bear the sacrosanct &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; name&quot;. A second opinion given by Adam Biessener supported this view, with Biessener feeling that the game did little to distinguish itself from other similar titles. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Brad Shoemaker enjoyed the game despite faulting its high hardware demands for the full experience, and his publication later named it the best GameCube game of February 2004. Mary Jane Irwin of &quot;IGN&quot; also gave praise to its gameplay concepts and design, but noted a lack of replay value and the steep entry requirements for multiplayer.

Reviewers praised the game&#x27;s art design and music, but most considered the story lacking compared to other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games. The gameplay was lauded for its implementation of multiplayer despite the hardware requirements and its detrimental effect on the single player campaign. A consensus in both Japanese and international reviews was that it was an innovative title, but with several flaws keeping it from being ranked among the best &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games.

&quot;Remastered Edition&quot; saw generally &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews on both Switch and PS4. Jordan Rudek of &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; felt that the single-player campaign lacked compelling content, and the multiplayer was hampered by the new additions to the point of making it worse than the original. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Seth Macy was very negative, feeling that the game only made the original frustrating mechanics worse and added new problems. Mitch Vogel, writing for &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;, felt that the game would not appeal to a wide demographic and the new multiplayer functions sapped much of the original version&#x27;s entertainment. Bryan Vitale of &quot;RPG Site&quot; felt it was still &quot;serviceable&quot; as an RPG, but showed its age and lacked polish on top of the frustrating online multiplayer functions. Kirstin Swalley of &quot;Hardcore Gamer&quot; was notably more positive, noting the age of its graphics design but otherwise finding it a fun and enjoyable &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; title. Reviews generally praised the art and music, but many faulted its archaic gameplay and unfriendly online multiplayer design.

===Sales===
During its debut in Japan, &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; sold over 179,500 units, reaching second place in sales charts. During the next two weeks, it first dropped to third place then rose to second place again. By 2004, &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; had sold nearly 355,000 units, becoming the twenty-eighth best-selling game title of the year in Japan and boosting GameCube sales for August. Following its North American release, the game was the best-selling title of the month. In the United Kingdom, the game was the best-selling GameCube title of its week of release, a position it retained during the second week. As of October 2007, the game has shipped over 1.3 million copies worldwide.

The Nintendo Switch version sold 48,957 physical copies during its first week on sale in Japan, making it the third bestselling retail game of the week in the country.

===Awards and retrospectives===
&quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; received the Grand Prize at the 2003 Japan Media Arts Festival, based on its multiplayer function and graphical achievements. During the 2004 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers ceremony, the game was nominated for awards in the &quot;Character Design&quot;, &quot;Costume Design&quot;, &quot;Game - Sequel RPG&quot; and &quot;Original Musical Score&quot; categories. It was later nominated for the &quot;Console Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; award at the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

&quot;IGN&quot; ranked the game in 2003 prior to its Western release as second in a list of the best co-op video games; while noting that the game&#x27;s unusual features and chosen platform caused confusion within the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; fan base, its multiplayer promised a high quality experience if other elements could live up to it. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Rob Haines praised the game&#x27;s approach to the inherent conflict between multiplayer gameplay and narrative, and despite its drawbacks called its multiplayer function &quot;the most fully-featured implementation of Gamecube-Game Boy Advance connectivity ever created&quot;. Henry Gilbert of &quot;GamesRadar&quot;, as part of a 2017 article ranking the best &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; spin-off games, praised the game&#x27;s multiplayer elements and return to Nintendo consoles despite its extensive hardware demands.

==Legacy==

&quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; was the only original game developed by the Game Designers Studio, which had become a subsidiary of Square Enix following the 2003 merger. The Game Designers Studio was eventually renamed SQEX Corporation in 2005. It was later merged with Taito in 2006 following Taito&#x27;s acquisition by Square Enix, and eventually dissolved entirely during consolidation of Square Enix&#x27;s arcade businesses in 2010.

Multiple &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; titles were later developed for Nintendo&#x27;s later consoles, with Square Enix&#x27;s aim being to make full use of Nintendo hardware while developing the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise. The first was &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates&quot; for the Nintendo DS (DS). Two further titles were &quot;Echoes of Time&quot; for the DS and Wii, and &quot;The Crystal Bearers&quot; for the Wii. Square Enix also developed two &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; titles for the Wii&#x27;s WiiWare service; &quot;My Life as a King&quot; and its direct sequel &quot;My Life as a Darklord&quot;. All the &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; games share the same continuity, creating a narrative spanning several millennia.

Kataoka would go on to work on the scenarios of multiple titles following &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; including &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;XII&quot;. He eventually left the company and founded Studio Reel in 2012. Studio Reel and Kataoka would work together with Kawazu on the development of the 2015 title &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="418595" wikidata="Q1056265" url="?curid=418595" title="Hugo Award for Best Novelette">
<text>The Hugo Award for Best Novelette is one of the Hugo Awards given each year for science fiction or fantasy stories published or translated into English during the previous calendar year. The novelette award is available for works of fiction of between 7,500 and 17,500 words; awards are also given out in the short story, novella and novel categories. The Hugo Awards have been described as &quot;a fine showcase for speculative fiction&quot; and &quot;the best known literary award for science fiction writing&quot;.

The Hugo Award for Best Novelette was first awarded in 1955, and was subsequently awarded in 1956 and 1959, lapsing in 1960. The category was reinstated for 1967 through 1969, before lapsing again in 1970; after returning in 1973, it has remained to date. In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, have been available to be awarded for 50, 75, or 100 years prior. Retro Hugos may only be awarded for years after 1939 in which no awards were originally given. To date, Retro Hugo awards have been given for novelettes for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954.

Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, and the award presentation constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The novelettes on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of stories that can be nominated. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year&#x27;s Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations. Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.

During the 66 nomination years, 211 authors have had works nominated; 52 of these have won, including coauthors and Retro Hugos. Three translators have been noted along with the author of a novelette written in a language other than English: Lia Belt for a translation from Dutch in 2015, Ken Liu for a translation from Chinese in 2016, and Emily Jen for a translation from Chinese in 2024. Poul Anderson, Isaac Asimov, and Harlan Ellison both have received the most Hugos for Best Novelette at three, with Ellison having been nominated a total of six times, while seven other authors have won twice. Mike Resnick has had the most nominations at eight, and Ursula K. Le Guin and Greg Egan have been nominated seven times each. Fifteen other authors have been nominated at least four times, while Egan has the most nominations without winning.

== Winners and nominees ==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novelette was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot;. Entries with a yellow background have won the award; those with a grey background are the nominees on the short-list. If the novelette was originally published in a book with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine, the publisher&#x27;s name is included after the book title.

  *   Winners and joint winners

=== Retro Hugos ===
Beginning with the 1996 Worldcon, the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years before the current year, if no awards were originally given that year. Retro Hugos have been awarded eight times, for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954.

<doc id="418598" wikidata="Q383355" url="?curid=418598" title="Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)">
<text>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is a 1953 American musical comedy film directed by Howard Hawks and written by Charles Lederer. The film is based on the 1949 stage musical of the same name, which in turn is based on the 1925 novel of the same name by Anita Loos. The film stars Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe, with Charles Coburn, Elliott Reid, Tommy Noonan, George Winslow, Taylor Holmes and Norma Varden in supporting roles.

The film is filled with comedic situations and musical numbers, choreographed by Jack Cole, while the music was written by Hoagy Carmichael, Harold Adamson, Jule Styne and Leo Robin. The songs by Styne and Robin are from the Broadway show, while the songs by Carmichael and Adamson were written especially for the film.

Monroe&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; and her pink dress are part of popular culture and are considered iconic; the performance has inspired and been recreated by various artists as an homage.

==Plot==
Lorelei Lee and Dorothy Shaw are American showgirls and best friends, although the two are very different. Lorelei thinks more of a man&#x27;s financial wealth and likes men who can support her passion for diamonds, such as her fiancé Gus Esmond Jr., who can provide all of her financial needs. Dorothy prefers men who are attractive and fit, and she does not care about their wealth.

Lorelei plans to wed Gus in France, but they are forbidden to travel together by Gus&#x27;s strict father Esmond Sr., who despises Lorelei. Lorelei decides to travel to France with or without Gus, and before she leaves, he gives her a letter of credit to cover expenses upon her arrival, and promises to later meet her in France. However, he also warns her to behave, noting that his father will prohibit their marriage if Esmond Sr. hears rumors of misdeeds. Gus and Lorelei are unaware that Esmond Sr. has hired private detective Ernie Malone to spy on Lorelei.

During the Atlantic crossing, Malone immediately falls in love with Dorothy, but she has already been drawn to the members of the male Olympic team. Lorelei meets the rich and foolish Sir Francis &quot;Piggy&quot; Beekman, the owner of a diamond mine, and is attracted by his wealth. Although Piggy is married, Lorelei naively returns his geriatric flirtations, which annoys his wife, Lady Beekman.

Lorelei invites Piggy to the cabin that she shares with Dorothy, where he recounts his travels to Africa. Malone spies through the window and takes pictures of them but is seen by Dorothy as he walks away. She tells Lorelei, who fears for her reputation. They devise a scheme to intoxicate Malone and search him to recover the incriminating film while he is unconscious. They find the film in his pants, and Lorelei prints and hides the negatives. Revealing her success to Piggy, she persuades him to give her Lady Beekman&#x27;s tiara. However, Malone reveals that he had planted a recording device in Lorelei&#x27;s cabin and has heard her discussion with Piggy about the pictures and the tiara. Malone implies that Lorelei is a gold digger and when Dorothy scolds him for his actions, he admits to being a liar. However, Dorothy reveals to Lorelei that she is falling for Malone, and Lorelei chastises her for choosing a poor man when she could easily have a rich one.
The ship arrives in France, and Lorelei and Dorothy spend time shopping. However, they discover that Lorelei&#x27;s letter of credit has been canceled and are then evicted from their hotel because of the information that Malone shared with Esmond Sr. They are forced to find work as showgirls in Paris, headlining a lavish revue. When Gus appears at their show, Lorelei rebuffs him and then performs &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;. Meanwhile, Lady Beekman has filed charges regarding her missing tiara, and Lorelei is arraigned for theft. Dorothy persuades Lorelei to return the tiara, but they discover that it is missing from her jewelry box. Piggy tries to deny his part in the affair when Malone catches him at the airport.

Dorothy stalls for time in court by pretending to be Lorelei, disguised in a blonde wig and mimicking her friend&#x27;s breathy voice and mannerisms. When Malone appears in court and is about to unmask Dorothy, she reveals to Malone in covert language that she loves him but would never forgive him if he hurts Lorelei. Malone withdraws his comments but then reveals that Piggy has the tiara, exonerating Lorelei.

Back at the nightclub, Lorelei impresses Esmond Sr. with a speech on the subject of paternal money and argues that if Esmond Sr. had a daughter instead of a son, he would want the best for her. He agrees and consents to the marriage. A double wedding is held for Lorelei and Dorothy and their grooms.

==Cast==

==Production==

Director Howard Hawks had never before made a musical film, but he owed Fox one more film, so he agreed. The stage musical, starring Carol Channing, had already been running for two years on Broadway when Fox paid $250,000 for the film rights. The original intention was a vehicle for Betty Grable and Ginger Rogers; however, after the success of Monroe&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Niagara&quot; (1953), the studio believed it had a more potent, and less expensive, sex symbol than Grable.

Although Hawks is credited as the sole director of the film, Russell and assistant choreographer Gwen Verdon contend that all musical numbers were actually staged by Jack Cole. Russell said, &quot;Howard Hawks had nothing to do with the musical numbers. He was not even there.&quot; Hawks later confirmed this in an interview with author Joseph McBride: &quot;I did a musical called &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;, and I didn&#x27;t do the production numbers. I didn&#x27;t have any desire to.&quot;

An uncredited George Chakiris, future Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actor (as Bernardo in &quot;West Side Story&quot;, 1961 version), can be glimpsed as one of the wealthy men pursuing Marilyn in &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;. Two other uncredited &quot;suitors&quot; in this musical number are Larry Kert and Matt Mattox.

According to Monroe&#x27;s last interview before her death, she was paid her usual contract salary of $500 a week, for a total of $18,000, while Russell, the better-known actress at the time, earned $200,000.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film earned $5.3 million at the box office worldwide, and was the seventh-highest-grossing film of 1953, with $5.1 million in North America, while Monroe&#x27;s next feature, &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; (also 1953), was the fourth-highest.

===Critical reception===
The film received positive reviews from critics. Monroe and Russell were both praised for their performances even by critics who panned the film.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Howard Hawks&#x27; direction &quot;uncomfortably cloddish and slow&quot; and found the gags for Russell &quot;devoid of character or charm,&quot; but concluded, &quot;And yet, there is that about Miss Russell and also about Miss Monroe that keeps you looking at them even when they have little or nothing to do.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote that Hawks &quot;maintains a racy air that brings the musical off excellently at a pace that helps cloak the fact that it&#x27;s rather lightweight, but sexy, stuff. However, not much more is needed when patrons can look at Russell-Monroe lines as displayed in slick costumes and Technicolor.&quot;

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote: &quot;Both Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe are nothing short of sensational in the leading roles. They not only act well, but the sexy manner in which they display their song, dance and pulchritude values just about sets the screen on fire and certainly is crowd-pleasing, judging by the thunderous applause at the preview after each of the well-staged musical numbers.&quot;

John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that the two leads &quot;have a good deal of enthusiasm, and occasionally their exuberance offsets the tedium of one long series of variations on the sort of anatomical joke that used to amuse the customers of Minsky so inordinately.&quot;

Britain&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; praised Jane Russell for her &quot;enjoyable Dorothy, full of gusto and good nature,&quot; but thought that the film had been compromised from the play &quot;by the casting of Marilyn Monroe, by the abandonment of the 20s period and the incongruous up-to-date streamlining, by inflating some bright, witty songs into lavish production numbers, and by tamely ending the whole thing by letting two true loves conventionally come true. There is too, a lack of grasp in Howard Hawks&#x27; handling, which is scrappy and uninventive.&quot;

On review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 88 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Anchored by Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell&#x27;s sparkling magnetism, &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; is a delightfully entertaining 1950s musical.&quot;

German film director Rainer Werner Fassbinder declared the film one of the ten best ever.

Recent reviews have noted that the film is groundbreaking for its depiction of female friendships and agency for women. Writing for &quot;Bust&quot; magazine, Samantha Mann wrote, &quot;Throughout the entire film, the main characters Lorelei (Marilyn Monroe) and Dorothy (Jane Russell) display consistent loyalty to one another. There is no back-stabbing, shit-talking, or degrading one another to come out on top or gain the affection of a man. The women remain steadfast in their loyalty to one another, and tolerate no one speaking ill of the other. Providing support and comfort to one another takes priority over finding ways to secure their desired men.&quot; Caroline Siede of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote the story may appear to be a &quot;90-minute misogynistic punchline about the desperate schemes of two devious social-climbing showgirls, ditzy Lorelei Lee (Monroe) and witty man-eater Dorothy Shaw (Jane Russell). Thankfully, &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; is quite the opposite. It&#x27;s a cheeky social satire about gender and class that doubles as a celebration of female ingenuity and solidarity, all glammed up in a ballgown and diamonds.&quot;

===Accolades===
Monroe and Russell left their handprints and footprints in cement in the forecourt of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in a spectacle that generated a great deal of publicity for the actresses and the film.

<doc id="418599" wikidata="Q1056251" url="?curid=418599" title="Hugo Award for Best Short Story">
<text>The Hugo Award for Best Short Story is one of the Hugo Awards given each year for science fiction or fantasy stories published or translated into English during the previous calendar year. The short story award is available for works of fiction of fewer than 7,500 words; awards are also given out for pieces of longer lengths in the novelette, novella, and novel categories. The Hugo Awards have been described as &quot;a fine showcase for speculative fiction&quot; and &quot;the best known literary award for science fiction writing&quot;.

The Hugo Award for Best Short Story has been awarded annually since 1955, except in 1957. The award was titled &quot;Best Short Fiction&quot; rather than &quot;Best Short Story&quot; in 1960–1966. During this time no Novelette category was awarded and the Novella category had not yet been established; the award was defined only as a work &quot;of less than novel length&quot; that was not published as a stand-alone book. In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, have been available to be awarded for 50, 75, or 100 years prior. Retro Hugos may only be awarded for years after 1939 in which no awards were originally given. To date, Retro Hugo awards have been given for short stories for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954.

During the 77 nomination years, 219 authors have had works nominated; 59 of these have won, including co-authors and Retro Hugos. One translator has been noted along with the author of a story written in a language other than English: Alex Woodend, in 2024, for a translation of a work from Chinese. Harlan Ellison has received the most Hugos for Best Short Story at four, Arthur C. Clarke, Larry Niven, Mike Resnick, Michael Swanwick, and Connie Willis have each won three times, and Poul Anderson, Joe Haldeman, Naomi Kritzer, and Ken Liu have won twice, the only other authors to win more than once. Resnick has received the most nominations at 18, while Swanwick has received 14; no other author has gotten more than 7. Michael A. Burstein, with 7, has the highest number of nominations without winning.

==Selection==
Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The short stories on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of stories that can be nominated. The 1955 and 1958 awards did not include any recognition of runner-up stories, but since 1959 all six candidates have been recorded. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year&#x27;s Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations. Worldcons are generally held near Labor Day, and are held in a different city around the world each year. Members are permitted to vote &quot;no award&quot;, if they feel that none of the nominees is deserving of the award that year, and in the case that &quot;no award&quot; takes the majority the Hugo is not given in that category. This happened in the Best Short Story category in 2015.

== Winners and nominees ==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the short story was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot; article. Entries with a yellow background have won the award; those with a grey background are the nominees on the short-list. If the short story was originally published in a book with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine, the book title is included after the publisher&#x27;s name.

=== Retro Hugos ===
Beginning with the 1996 Worldcon, the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years before the current year, if no awards were originally given that year. Retro Hugos have been awarded eight times, for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954.

<doc id="418600" wikidata="Q2568152" url="?curid=418600" title="Greece–Turkey relations">
<text>Greece and Turkey established diplomatic relations in the 1830s following Greece&#x27;s formation after its declaration of independence from the Ottoman Empire. Modern relations began when Turkey was proclaimed a republic in 1923 following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I. Rivalry has characterised their relations for most of their history with periods of positive relations but no underlying resolution of the main issues.

Control of the eastern Mediterranean and Aegean seas remains as the main issue. Following the aftermath of World War II, the UNCLOS treaty, the decolonisation of Cyprus, and the addition of the Dodecanese to Greece&#x27;s territory have strained the relationship. Several issues frequently affect their current relations, including territorial disputes over the sea and air, minority rights, and Turkey&#x27;s relationship with the European Union (EU) and its member states—especially Cyprus. Control of energy pipelines is also an increasing focus in their relations. 

== Contextual overview on relations ==
The histories of the Byzantine Empire and Ottoman Empire factor into modern relations between Turkey and Greece. Anthony Kaldellis views the Byzantine Empire as the medieval expression of a Greek nation and a pre-modern nation state. There is a debate that Turkey is not a successor state but the legal continuation of the Ottoman Empire as a republic.

Greece and Turkey have a rivalry with a history of events that have been used to justify their nationalism. These events include the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, the Istanbul pogrom and Cypriot intercommunal violence. Greek-Turkish feuding was not a significant factor in international relations from 1930 to 1955, and during the Cold War, domestic and bipolar politics limited competitive behaviour against each other. By the mid-1990s and later decades, these restraints on their rivalry were removed, and both nations had become each other&#x27;s biggest security risk.

== Diplomatic missions ==
The first official diplomatic contact between Greece and the Ottoman Empire occurred in 1830. Consular relations between the two countries were established in 1834. In 1853, a Greek embassy was opened in Istanbul; this was discontinued during periods of crisis and eventually transferred to the new capital Ankara in 1923 when the Republic of Turkey was formed.

Turkey&#x27;s missions in Greece include its embassy in Athens and consulates general in Thessaloniki, Komotini and Rhodes. Greece&#x27;s missions in Turkey include its embassy in Ankara, and consulates general in Istanbul, İzmir and Edirne.

== History ==
=== Background ===


The Greek presence in Asia Minor (Anatolia) dates to the Late Bronze Age (1450 BC) or earlier. The Göktürks of the First Turkic Khaganate was the first Turkic state to politically use the name Türk. The first contact with the Byzantine Empire is believed to have occurred in AD 563. In the 10th century, the Seljuk Turks rose to power. 

The first conflict between the Byzantine Empire and Seljuk Turks occurred at the Battle of Kapetron in 1048. More notable is the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 and the Turkish settlement of Anatolia that followed. Later, Turkish Anatolian beyliks were established in former Byzantine lands and in the territory of the fragmenting Seljuk Sultanate. One of those beyliks was the Ottoman dynasty, which became the Ottoman Empire.
 In 1453, the Ottoman Empire conquered Constantinople, the capital city of the Byzantine Empire.

Much of modern Greece and Turkey came under Ottoman rule in the 15th century. During the following centuries, there were sporadic but unsuccessful Greek uprisings against Ottoman rule. Greek nationalism started to appear in the 18th century. In March 1821. the Greek War of Independence began.

=== Greece and the Ottoman Empire relations: 1822–1923 ===

Following the Greek War of Independence, Greece was formed as an independent state in 1830. Relations between Greece and the Ottoman Empire were shaped by the Eastern Question and the Megali Idea. Conflicts between the two countries include the Epirus Revolt of 1854 during the Crimean War, the 1878 Greek Macedonian rebellion and the Epirus Revolt of 1878 during the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878). Wars between the Ottomans and the Greeks include the Greco-Turkish War (1897) and the two Balkan Wars. By the end of the Second Balkan War due to the Treaty of Bucharest (1913) Greece grew by two-thirds; it went from and its population from 2,660,000 to 4,363,000. With the Allies&#x27; victory in World War I, Greece was awarded sovereignty over Western Thrace in the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine; and Eastern Thrace and the Smyrna area in the Treaty of Sèvres. Greek gains were largely undone by the subsequent Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922).


Greece occupied Smyrna on 15 May 1919, while Mustafa Kemal Pasha (later Atatürk), who was to become the leader of the Turkish opposition to the Treaty of Sèvres, landed in Samsun on 19 May 1919, an action that is regarded as the beginning of the Turkish War of Independence. Mustafa Kemal united the protesting voices in Anatolia and began a nationalist movement to repel the Allied armies that had occupied the Ottoman Empire and establish new borders for a sovereign Turkish nation. The Turkish nation would be Western in civilisation and would elevate Turkish culture that had faded under Arab culture; this included disassociating Islam from Arab culture and restricted it to the private sphere.

The Turkish Parliament in Ankara formally abolished the Sultanate and the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) ended all conflict and replaced previous treaties to constitute modern Turkey. The treaty provided for a population exchange between Greece and Turkey.

The treaty also contained a declaration of amnesty for the perpetrators of crimes that were committed between 1914 and 1922, a period which was marked by many atrocities. The Greek genocide was the systematic killing of the Christian-Ottoman Greek population of Anatolia which started before World War I, and continued during the war and its aftermath (1914–1922).

=== Initial relations between Greece and Turkey: 1923–1945 ===
Following the population exchange, Greece wanted to end hostilities but negotiations stalled because of the issue of valuations of the properties of the exchanged populations. Driven by Eleftherios Venizelos in co-operation with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, as well as İsmet İnönü&#x27;s government, a series of treaties between Greece and Turkey were signed in 1930, in effect restoring Greek-Turkish relations and establishing a &quot;de facto&quot; alliance between the two countries. As part of these treaties, Greece and Turkey agreed the Treaty of Lausanne would be the final settlement of their respective borders, pledged they would not join opposing military or economic alliances, and to immediately stop their naval arms race.

The Balkan Pact of 1934 was signed, in which Greece and Turkey joined Yugoslavia and Romania in a treaty of mutual assistance, and settled outstanding issues. Venizelos nominated Atatürk for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1934.

Greece was a signatory to a 1936 agreement that gives Turkey control over the Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits, and regulates the transit of naval warships. The nations signed the 1938 Salonika Agreement which abandoned the demilitarised zones along the Turkish border with Greece that were a result of the Treaty of Lausanne.

In 1941, due to Turkey&#x27;s neutrality during the Second World War, Britain lifted the blockade and allowed shipments of grain from Turkey to relieve the great famine in Athens during the Axis occupation. Using the vessel , foodstuffs were collected by a nationwide campaign of Kızılay, the Turkish Red Crescent, and the operation was funded by the American Greek War Relief Association and the Hellenic Union of Constantinopolitans.

During this period, the Greek minority that remained in Turkey faced discriminatory targeting. In 1941 in anticipation of the Second World War, in the Twenty Classes, adult male Armenians, Greeks and Jews were conscripted into labour battalions. In 1942, Turkey imposed the Varlık Vergisi, a special tax that heavily impacted the non-Muslim minorities of Turkey. Officially, the tax was devised to fill the state treasury that would have been needed if Germany or the Soviet Union invaded the country. The tax&#x27;s main purpose, however, was to nationalise the Turkish economy by reducing minority populations&#x27; influence and control over the country&#x27;s trade, finance, and industries.

=== Post World War II relations: 1945–1982 ===


Following the power vacuum left by the ending of the Axis occupation after the war, the Greek Civil War erupted as one of the first conflicts of the Cold War. It represented the first example of Cold War involvement on the part of the Allies in the internal affairs of a non-Allied country. Turkey was a focus for the Soviet Union due to foreign control of the straits; it was a central reason for the outbreak of the Cold War In 1950, both Greece and Turkey fought in the Korean War, ending Turkey&#x27;s diplomatic isolation and brought it an invitation to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); in 1952, both countries joined NATO; and in 1953, Greece, Turkey and Yugoslavia formed a new Balkan Pact for mutual defence against the Soviet Union.

According to think tank Geopolitical Futures, three events contributed to the deterioration of post-1945 bilateral relations:

#After the defeat of Italy in the Second World War, the long-standing issue of sovereignty over the Dodecanese archipelago, which had been a sore point since the Venizelos–Tittoni agreement between Greece and Italy, was resolved to Greece&#x27;s favour in 1946, upsetting Turkey because it changed the balance of power. Turkey renounced claims to the Dodecanese in the Treaty of Lausanne but future administrations wanted them for security reasons, and possibly due to the Cyprus issue.
#After the decolonisation of Cyprus, conflict between Greeks and Turks broke out on the island. In the 1950s, the pursuit of &quot;enosis&quot; became a part of Greece&#x27;s national policy. Taksim became the slogan by some Turkish Cypriots in reaction to &quot;enosis&quot;. Tensions between Greece and Turkey increased, and the ambivalence towards Cyprus by the Greek government of George Papandreou led to the Greek military coup. In 1974, the Greek government staged a coup against the Cypriot president and Archbishop Makarios by invading Cyprus and establishing a Greece-controlled Cyprus government. Soon after, Turkey—using its guarantor status arising from the trilateral accords of the 1959–1960 Zürich and London Agreement—invaded Cyprus. The Turkish Federated State of Cyprus was declared one year later. 
#Starting in 1958 and expanded in 1982 for the issue of territorial waters, the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) replaced the older concept of freedom of the seas, which dated from the 17th century. According to this concept, national rights were limited to a specified belt of water extending from a nation&#x27;s coastlines, usually —known as the three-mile limit. By 1967, only 30 nations still used the old three-nautical-mile convention. It was ratified by Greece in 1972 but Turkey has not ratified it, asking for a bilateral solution since 1974 which uses the mid-line of the Aegean instead

In 1955, the Adnan Menderes government is believed to have orchestrated the Istanbul pogrom, which targeted the city&#x27;s substantial Greek ethnic minority and other minorities. In September 1955, a bomb exploded close to the Turkish consulate in Greece&#x27;s second-largest city Thessaloniki, also damaging the Atatürk Museum, site of Atatürk&#x27;s birthplace, breaking some windows but causing little other damage. In retaliation, in Istanbul, thousands of shops, houses, churches and graves belonging to members of the ethnic Greek minority were destroyed within a few hours, over 12 people were killed and many more injured. The ongoing struggle between Turkey and Greece over control of Cyprus, and Cypriot intercommunal violence, were concurrent with the pogrom. Pressure over the resulting London Conference to discuss Cyprus, and to direct attention away from the domestic political problems were the likely motivation of the Turkish Menderes government.

In 1964, Turkish prime minister İsmet İnönü renounced the Greco-Turkish Treaty of Friendship of 1930 and took actions against the Greek minority. An estimated 50,000 Greeks were expelled. A 1971 Turkish law nationalised religious high schools and closed the Halki seminary on Istanbul&#x27;s Heybeli Island, an issue that affects 21st-century relations.

== Contemporary history and issues ==
=== Military and diplomatic tensions ===
Towards the end of the 20th century, there were several high profile incidents between the countries. In 1986 by the border at the Evros River, a Greek soldier was shot dead. In 1987, the Turkish survey ship &quot;Sismik 1&quot; nearly triggered a war. In 1995, a military crisis erupted over an uninhabited island called Imia, over which both countries claim sovereignty.

Lesser incidents where both side exchange fire often occur. This creates volatility when relations are tense and the risk of starting war.

In the 1990s, Duygu Bazoglu Sezer claims Greece pursued a policy of encircling Turkey. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, both Greece and Turkey viewed each other with suspicion as they developed relations with the new countries. In 1995, however, this fear materialised. Greece formed a defence co-operation agreement with Syria, and between 1995 and 1998 established good relations with Turkey&#x27;s other neighbours Iran and Armenia. In reaction, Turkey spoke with Israel in 1996, which caused uproar in Arab countries.

Dr. R. Craig Nation of the United States Army War College views the conflict between the nations as a fight for control over the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean.

=== Positive relations ===
In 1995, relations began to change with the Greek election of Kostas Simitis who redefined priorities but it wasn&#x27;t until the meeting of the foreign ministers the following years that this was noticed. In 1998, the capture of the Kurdish separatist Abdullah Öcalan – on the way from the Greek embassy in Kenya – and the related fallout led to the Greek foreign minister resigning, whose replacement was with a strong supporter for discussions with Turkey. The 1999 İzmit earthquake followed by the 1999 Athens earthquake led to an outpouring of goodwill and what has been called earthquake diplomacy that aided in a change of relations.

In the years that followed, relations improved. They included agreements on fighting organised crime, reducing military spending, preventing illegal immigration, and clearing land mines on the border. Additionally, Greece lifted its opposition to Turkey&#x27;s accession to the European Union (EU). Dr R. Craig Nation states there was a lot of progress but ultimately not on the issues that mattered.

In December 2023, a new attempt was made at peaceful relations. Dialogue has opened, with the signing of a declaration on good neighbourly relations. Pundits however remain unconvinced it means anything, at least until the Cyprus issue is addressed.

=== The Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean conflicts ===
The conflict between Turkey and Greece is largely over whether the Greek islands are allowed an exclusive economic zone, the basis of claiming rights over the sea. Some claim fear of sovereignty loss is what is driving this conflict. Under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Blue Homeland policy of Turkey has emerged. Islands and islets Iying within of the coast were included as part of the respective state under the Treaty of Lausanne. Greece controversially extended this limit to in 1936, which Turkey did not dispute due to good relations and reciprocated in 1964. The conference for the UN sea treaty UNCLOS defined territorial waters in 1982 and came into force in 1994.

There are 168 nations as signatories of the treaty, including Greece but not Turkey. Turkey disputes Greece can claim 12 miles off the coast of its islands, which the sea treaty permits, implying only the mainland has this right, otherwise it would give Greece dominant control of the Aegean. Turkey has made a claim for the economic zone by splitting the Aegean Sea in the middle. The EU requires membership of the sea treaty as a condition.

There has been an extension of the conflict with other nations in the Mediterranean. In 2019 and 2022, Turkey made deals with Libya to extend its economic rights over the sea, which were countered with Greece and Egypt.

The Cyprus dispute created a subsequent military build up. The dispute escalated with Greece&#x27;s coup in Cyprus, which led to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. In 1974, Greece reacted with the militarisation of the Greek islands off the coast of Turkey, the legality of which is challenged by Turkey. In 1975, Turkey created Izmir army base. Military buildups in 2022 have continued.

=== Cyprus and the EU ===

Greece has been a member of the EU since 1981. Cyprus joined in 2004. Turkey submitted its application to join in 1987 and became a full candidate in 1999.

Greece since its admission had made a concentrated effort to oppose Turkey&#x27;s admission to the EU and was scapegoated for resentment when it happened. This is despite its change of policy post 1995 and that was advocated during the Papandreou government. Concerns about Turkey&#x27;s developmental and demographic imbalances as well as human rights and its war with Abdullah Öcalan’s Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) were factors in the EU decision but in Turkey it was felt due to the “Christians’ Club&quot; of the EU. In Turkey, this contributed to the shift away from Turkey&#x27;s founding secular doctrine Kemalism and the rise of political Islam. There was a change to the Kemalism amnesia of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s past, which instead became a source of pride and identity for Turkey. Kemalism evolved to an alternative identity of European orientation as Turkey became a regional centre in the emerging Eurasian political formation.

In the 1990s, friction around Turkey&#x27;s EU accession involving Cyprus was paralleled by military tensions between Turkey and Greece. In 1994, Greece and Cyprus agreed on a security doctrine that would mean any Turkish military action in Cyprus would cause war with Greece. In 1997, Cyprus purchased two Soviet-era S-300 missile systems, resulting in a political standoff between Cyprus and Turkey. Negotiations on the division on the island in the 1990s failed because of the Turkish side&#x27;s recognition of North Cyprus as an independent state, an issue that remains as of 2022. When Cyprus joined the EU in 2004, the possibility of a veto by Cyprus contributed to other issues involving Turkey.

Turkey&#x27;s migrant crisis has also had a big effect on its relationship with the EU. The enforcement of the arms embargo against Libya Operation Irini brought other EU members into conflict with Turkey. Gas drilling on territory disputed with Greece using research vessel RV &quot;MTA Oruç Reis&quot; led to EU sanctions against Turkey.

=== Energy pipelines ===
The 2010 discovery of natural gas deposits in the eastern Mediterranean, first by Israel and then Egypt, has increased tensions between Greece and Turkey. The region is estimated to contain 5% of the world&#x27;s known natural gas reserves. Historical security issues of the Aegean and Cyprus are important for resolving Europe&#x27;s energy needs. The 2016 Turkey-Israel reconciliation led to Greece sabotaging the 2017 Cyprus–UN talks to reunify the island, preventing Israel and Turkey from developing a gas pipeline. In 2019, the east Mediterranean gas forum was created, including seven countries but excluding Turkey.

The region is considered the end-point for east–west pipelines. In 2007, the countries inaugurated the Greek-Turkish natural gas pipeline, giving gas from the Caspian Sea its first direct Western outlet. The Caspian Sea is one of the oldest oil-producing regions; it is estimated to have reserves of 48 billion barrels, and 292 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The opening of these fields followed more than 20 years of negotiation following the 2018 convention on the legal status of the Caspian Sea. Outside of the Caspian Sea nations, there are other suppliers that wish to leverage the geographical positioning of the nations. In May 2022, Greece signed a deal with Turkey&#x27;s rival the United Arab Emirates for the distribution of the UAE&#x27;s liquefied natural gas.

=== Minority rights ===

The treaty of Lausanne provided for the protection of the Greek Orthodox Christian minority in Turkey and the Muslim minority in Greece. The Greek minority in Turkey has shrunk from over 200,000 in 1923 to only 2,000 in 2023, while the Turkish minority in Greece has remained steady at 120,000 in the same period.

Minorities in both countries since have been affected by the state of relations between them. Minorities are used as leverage, using the principle of reciprocity. In the 1960s, Turkey pressured the Greek minority in Turkey when the Cyprus issue escalated. Turkey used the election of Muftis by the Muslim Turkish minority in Greece as a condition for opening Halki Seminary which was closed in 1971. As a reaction in 1972, Greece closed a Turkish school in Rhodes. In recent years, Turkey has used its cultural heritage, such as Sumela Monastery, to achieve political ends.

Examples of minority mistreatment include:
* During World War II, Turkey nationalised its industry and imposed the &quot;Varlık Vergisi&quot;, a discriminatory wealth tax that targeted religious minorities.
* Turkey blamed Greeks for Turkey&#x27;s economic problems, resulting in the Istanbul pogrom.
* In 1967, the Greek military government deported Turkish citizens on the Dodecanese peninsula.
* In 1955, Greece&#x27;s Article 19 of the Nationality Code established two classes of Greek citizens; those of &quot;non-Greek descent&quot; lost their citizenship if they left the country. By the time of its abolition in 1998, 60,000 people had lost their citizenship and the abolition had no retroactive effect.

The election of Muftis in Greece and the reopening of the Halki Seminary in Turkey have become the most prominent issues. Issues around political authority and pre-conditions contribute to the stalemate. Former Greek prime minister George Papandreou has said Turkey and Greece would benefit if they treated minorities as citizens rather than foreigners.

=== Migrants ===

Turkey has become a transit country for people entering Europe. In 2015, the route that passes from Turkey to Greece and then through the Balkan countries became the most-used route for migrants escaping conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa, with irregular migration from further East continuing. Turkey assumed the role of guardian of the Schengen Area, protecting it from irregular migration. This, combined with Turkey&#x27;s migrant crisis, has resulted in illegal migration being a key issue between Turkey and the EU. People moving across the border of Greece and Turkey are a frequent cause of incidents between the two countries.

In 2016, the EU and Turkey reached a deal on the migrant crisis. There was some success with the four-year agreement extended to 2022, but several incidents have occurred. In 2019, the Greek government warned a new migrant crisis similar to the previous one would occur.

=== Turkish insurgents and asylum seekers ===
During the 2010 trial of those accused of organising a 2003 alleged military coup attempt in Turkey called Sledgehammer, the conspirators were accused of planning attacks on mosques, triggering a conflict with Greece by Turkey shooting down one of its own warplanes and then accusing Greeks of this and planting bombs in Istanbul to initiate a military takeover.

Greece has on many occasions arrested members of the DHKP-C who planned attacks in Turkey. Turkey has accused Greece of supporting terrorists such as the DHKP-C.

Turkey has seen a slide to authoritarianism resulting in Turkish refugees becoming more common, like politician Leyla Birlik accused of insulting the president. This has increased since the failed 2016 Turkish coup d&#x27;état attempt, after which 995 people, including military personnel, applied for asylum. More than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017, including those who plotted the assassination. Sometimes, this causes tensions between the nations in other areas.

<text>CLIPS (C Language Integrated Production System) is a public-domain software tool for building expert systems. The syntax and name were inspired by Charles Forgy&#x27;s OPS5. The first versions of CLIPS were developed starting in 1985 at the NASA Johnson Space Center (as an alternative for existing system ART*Inference) until 1996, when the development group&#x27;s responsibilities ceased to focus on expert system technology. The original name of the project was &quot;NASA&#x27;s AI Language&quot; (NAIL).

As of 2005, CLIPS was probably the most widely used expert system tool. CLIPS is written in C, extensions can be written in C, and CLIPS can be called from C. Its syntax resembles that of the programming language Lisp.

CLIPS incorporates a complete object-oriented programming language for writing expert systems. COOL combines the programming paradigms of procedural, object oriented, and logic programming (automated theorem proving) languages.

==Facts and rules==
CLIPS uses forward chaining. Like other expert system languages, CLIPS deals with rules and facts. Various facts can make a rule applicable. An applicable rule is then fired. Facts and rules are created by first defining them, as shown below:

 (deftemplate car_problem
 (slot name)
 (slot status))

 (deffacts trouble_shooting
 (car_problem (name ignition_key) (status on))
 (car_problem (name engine) (status wont_start))
 (car_problem (name headlights) (status work)))

 (defrule rule1
 (car_problem (name ignition_key) (status on))
 (car_problem (name engine) (status wont_start))
 (assert (car_problem (name starter) (status faulty))))

Having set this up, the (reset) command causes CLIPS to read the facts and rules. In this case, that would lead to the three &quot;trouble_shooting&quot; facts being asserted. Then the (run) command is used. Given that the two facts listed in rule1 have both been asserted, the conditions for doing its action have been met so the additional fact is asserted as a result of the run.

CLIPS&gt; (reset)
CLIPS&gt; (agenda)
0 rule1: f-1,f-2
For a total of 1 activation.
CLIPS&gt; (facts)
f-0 (initial-fact)
f-1 (car_problem (name ignition_key) (status on))
f-2 (car_problem (name engine) (status wont_start))
f-3 (car_problem (name headlights) (status work))
For a total of 4 facts.
CLIPS&gt; (run)
CLIPS&gt; (facts)
f-0 (initial-fact)
f-1 (car_problem (name ignition_key) (status on))
f-2 (car_problem (name engine) (status wont_start))
f-3 (car_problem (name headlights) (status work))
f-4 (car_problem (name starter) (status faulty))
For a total of 5 facts.
CLIPS&gt;
(assert &lt;fact&gt;+)
 (Assert (object (name &quot;chair&quot;)
(Material wood)
(height 3feet)
(Color brown))
CLIPS(retract &lt;fact-index+)
(retract 0)
for a color
In CLIPS, &quot;salience&quot; allows a user to assign priority (or weight) to a rule.

==Descendants==
Descendants of the CLIPS language include Jess (rule-based portion of CLIPS rewritten in Java, it later grew in a different direction), and FuzzyCLIPS (which adds concept of relevancy into the language).

<doc id="418604" wikidata="Q1433256" url="?curid=418604" title="World3">
<text>The World3 model is a system dynamics model for computer simulation of interactions between population, industrial growth, food production and limits in the ecosystems of the earth. It was originally produced and used by a Club of Rome study that produced the model and the book &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; (1972). The creators of the model were Dennis Meadows, project manager, and a team of 16 researchers.

The model was documented in the book &quot;Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World&quot;. It added new features to Jay Wright Forrester&#x27;s World2 model. Since World3 was originally created, it has had minor tweaks to get to the World3/91 model used in the book &quot;Beyond the Limits&quot;, later improved to get the World3/2000 model distributed by the Institute for Policy and Social Science Research and finally the World3/2004 model used in the book &quot;Limits to Growth: the 30 year update&quot;.

World3 is one of several global models that have been generated throughout the world (Mesarovic/Pestel Model, Bariloche Model, MOIRA Model, SARU Model, FUGI Model) and is probably
the model that generated the spark for all later models .
== Model ==
The model consisted of several interacting parts. Each of these dealt with a different system of the model. The main systems were 
*the food system, dealing with agriculture and food production
*the industrial system
*the population system
*the non-renewable resources system
*the pollution system

=== Agricultural system ===
The simplest useful view of this system is that land and fertilizer are used for farming, and more of either will produce more food. In the context of the model, since land is finite, and industrial output required to produce fertilizer and other agricultural inputs can not keep up with demand, there necessarily will be a food collapse at some point in the future.

=== Nonrenewable resources system ===
The nonrenewable resource system starts with the assumption that the total amount of resources available is finite (about 110 times the consumption at 1990s rates for the World3/91 model). These resources can be extracted and then used for various purposes in other systems in the model. An important assumption that was made is that as the nonrenewable resources are extracted, the remaining resources are increasingly difficult to extract, thus diverting more and more industrial output to resource extraction.

The model combines all possible nonrenewable resources into one aggregate variable, . This combines both energy resources and non-energy resources. Examples of nonrenewable energy resources would include oil and coal. Examples of material nonrenewable resources would include aluminum and zinc. This assumption allows costless substitution between any nonrenewable resource. The model ignores differences between discovered resources and undiscovered resources.

The model assumes that as greater percentages of total nonrenewable resources are used, the amount of effort used to extract the nonrenewable resources will increase.
The way this cost is done is as a variable , or abbreviated . The way this variable is used is in the equation that calculates industrial output. Basically, it works as . This causes the amount of resources expended to depend on the amount of industrial capital, and not on the amount of resources consumed.

The consumption of nonrenewable resources is determined by a nonlinear function of the per capita industrial output. The higher the per capita industrial output, the higher the nonrenewable resource consumption.

=== Reference run predictions ===
The &quot;Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World&quot; provides several different scenarios. The &quot;reference run&quot; is the one that &quot;represent the most likely behavior mode of the system if the process of industrialization in the future proceeds in a way very similar to its progress in the past, and if technologies and value changes that have already been institutionalized continue to evolve.&quot; In this scenario, in 2000, the world population reaches six billion, and then goes on to peak at seven billion in 2030. After that population declines because of an increased death rate. In 2015, both industrial output per capita and food per capita peak at US$375 per person (1970s dollars, about $ today) and 500 vegetable-equivalent kilograms/person. Persistent pollution peaks in the year 2035 at 11 times 1970s levels.

== Criticism of the model ==
There has been criticism of the World3 model. Some has come from the model creators themselves, some has come from economists and some has come from other places. 

In the book &quot;Groping in the Dark: The First Decade of Global Modelling&quot;, Donella Meadows (a &quot;Limits&quot; author) writes: We have great confidence in the basic qualitative assumptions and conclusions about the instability of the current global socioeconomic system and the general kinds of changes that will and will not lead to stability. We have relatively great confidence in the feedback-loop structure of the model, with some exceptions which I list below. We have a mixed degree of confidence in the numerical parameters of the model; some are well-known physical or biological constants that are unlikely to change, some are statistically derived social indices quite likely to change, and some are pure guesses that are perhaps only of the right order of magnitude. The structural assumptions in World3 that I consider most dubious and also sensitive enough to be of concern are:

*the constant capital-output ratio (which assumes no diminishing returns to capital)
*the residual nature of the investment function
*the generally ineffective labour contribution to output

A detailed criticism of the model is in the book &quot;Models of Doom: A Critique of the Limits to Growth&quot;.

Czech-Canadian scientist and policy analyst Vaclav Smil disagreed with the combination of physically different processes into simplified equations:
He does however consider continuous growth in world GDP a problem:

Others have put forth criticisms, such as Henshaw, King, and Zarnikau who in a 2011 paper, &quot;Systems Energy Assessment&quot; point out that the methodology of such models may be valid empirically as a world model, but might not then also be useful for decision making. The impact data being used is generally collected according to where the impacts are recorded as occurring, following standard I/O material processes accounting methods. It is not reorganized according to who pays for or profits from the impacts, so who is actually responsible for economic impacts is never determined. In their view

*The economic motives causing the impacts, that might also control them, would then not be reflected in the model.
*As a seeming technicality, it could bring into question the use of many kinds of economic models for sustainability decision-making.

The authors of the book &quot;Surviving 1,000 Centuries&quot; consider some of the predictions too pessimistic, but some of the overall message correct.
At least one study disagrees with the criticism. Writing in the journal &quot;Global Environmental Change&quot;, Turner notes that &quot;30 years of historical data compare favorably with key features of the &#x27;business-as-usual&#x27; scenario called the &#x27;standard run&#x27; produced by the World3 model&quot;.

==Validation==
A number of researchers have attempted to test the predictions of the World3 model against observed data, with varying conclusions. One of the more recent of these, published in Yale&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Industrial Ecology&quot;, found that current empirical data is broadly consistent with the 1972 projections, and that if major changes to the consumption of resources are not undertaken, economic growth will peak and then rapidly decline by around 2040.

<text>In the field of artificial intelligence, an inference engine is a software component of an intelligent system that applies logical rules to the knowledge base to deduce new information. The first inference engines were components of expert systems. The typical expert system consisted of a knowledge base and an inference engine. The knowledge base stored facts about the world. The inference engine applied logical rules to the knowledge base and deduced new knowledge. This process would iterate as each new fact in the knowledge base could trigger additional rules in the inference engine. Inference engines work primarily in one of two modes either special rule or facts: forward chaining and backward chaining. Forward chaining starts with the known facts and asserts new facts. Backward chaining starts with goals, and works backward to determine what facts must be asserted so that the goals can be achieved.

Additionally, the concept of &#x27;inference&#x27; has expanded to include the process through which trained neural networks generate predictions or decisions. In this context, an &#x27;inference engine&#x27; could refer to the specific part of the system, or even the hardware, that executes these operations. This type of inference plays a crucial role in various applications, including (but not limited to) image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles. The inference phase in these applications is typically characterized by a high volume of data inputs and real-time processing requirements.

==Architecture==
The logic that an inference engine uses is typically represented as IF-THEN rules. The general format of such rules is IF &lt;logical expression&gt; THEN &lt;logical expression&gt;. Prior to the development of expert systems and inference engines, artificial intelligence researchers focused on more powerful theorem prover environments that offered much fuller implementations of first-order logic. For example, general statements that included universal quantification (for all X some statement is true) and existential quantification (there exists some X such that some statement is true). What researchers discovered is that the power of these theorem-proving environments was also their drawback. Back in 1965, it was far too easy to create logical expressions that could take an indeterminate or even infinite time to terminate. For example, it is common in universal quantification to make statements over an infinite set such as the set of all natural numbers. Such statements are perfectly reasonable and even required in mathematical proofs but when included in an automated theorem prover executing on a computer may cause the computer to fall into an infinite loop. Focusing on IF-THEN statements (what logicians call &quot;modus ponens&quot;) still gave developers a very powerful general mechanism to represent logic, but one that could be used efficiently with computational resources. What is more, there is some psychological research that indicates humans also tend to favor IF-THEN representations when storing complex knowledge.

A simple example of &quot;modus ponens&quot; often used in introductory logic books is &quot;If you are human then you are mortal&quot;. This can be represented in pseudocode as:

 Rule1: Human(x) =&gt; Mortal(x)

A trivial example of how this rule would be used in an inference engine is as follows. In &quot;forward chaining&quot;, the inference engine would find any facts in the knowledge base that matched Human(x) and for each fact it found would add the new information Mortal(x) to the knowledge base. So if it found an object called Socrates that was human it would deduce that Socrates was mortal. In &quot;backward chaining&quot;, the system would be given a goal, e.g. answer the question is Socrates mortal? It would search through the knowledge base and determine if Socrates was human and, if so, would assert he is also mortal. However, in backward chaining a common technique was to integrate the inference engine with a user interface. In that way, rather than simply being automated the system could now be interactive. In this trivial example, if the system was given the goal to answer the question if Socrates was mortal and it didn&#x27;t yet know if he was human, it would generate a window to ask the user the question &quot;Is Socrates human?&quot; and would then use that information accordingly.

This innovation of integrating the inference engine with a user interface led to the second early advancement of expert systems: explanation capabilities. The explicit representation of knowledge as rules rather than code made it possible to generate explanations to users: both explanations in real time and after the fact. So if the system asked the user &quot;Is Socrates human?&quot;, the user may wonder why she was being asked that question and the system would use the chain of rules to explain why it was currently trying to ascertain that bit of knowledge: that is, it needs to determine if Socrates is mortal and to do that needs to determine if he is human. At first these explanations were not much different than the standard debugging information that developers deal with when debugging any system. However, an active area of research was utilizing natural language technology to ask, understand, and generate questions and explanations using natural languages rather than computer formalisms.

An inference engine cycles through three sequential steps: &quot;match rules&quot;, &quot;select rules&quot;, and &quot;execute rules&quot;. The execution of the rules will often result in new facts or goals being added to the knowledge base, which will trigger the cycle to repeat. This cycle continues until no new rules can be matched.

In the first step, &quot;match rules&quot;, the inference engine finds all of the rules that are triggered by the current contents of the knowledge base. In forward chaining, the engine looks for rules where the antecedent (left hand side) matches some fact in the knowledge base. In backward chaining, the engine looks for antecedents that can satisfy one of the current goals.

In the second step, &quot;select rules&quot;, the inference engine prioritizes the various rules that were matched to determine the order to execute them. In the final step, &quot;execute rules&quot;, the engine executes each matched rule in the order determined in step two and then iterates back to step one again. The cycle continues until no new rules are matched.

==Implementations==
Early inference engines focused primarily on forward chaining. These systems were usually implemented in the Lisp programming language. Lisp was a frequent platform for early AI research due to its strong capability to do symbolic manipulation. Also, as an interpreted language it offered productive development environments appropriate to debugging complex programs. A necessary consequence of these benefits was that Lisp programs tended to be slower and less robust than compiled languages of the time such as C. A common approach in these early days was to take an expert system application and repackage the inference engine used for that system as a re-usable tool other researchers could use for the development of other expert systems. For example, MYCIN was an early expert system for medical diagnosis and EMYCIN was an inference engine extrapolated from MYCIN and made available for other researchers.

As expert systems moved from research prototypes to deployed systems there was more focus on issues such as speed and robustness. One of the first and most popular forward chaining engines was OPS5, which used the Rete algorithm to optimize the efficiency of rule firing. Another very popular technology that was developed was the Prolog logic programming language. Prolog focused primarily on backward chaining and also featured various commercial versions and optimizations for efficiency and robustness.

As expert systems prompted significant interest from the business world, various companies, many of them started or guided by prominent AI researchers created productized versions of inference engines. For example, Intellicorp was initially guided by Edward Feigenbaum. These inference engine products were also often developed in Lisp at first. However, demands for more affordable and commercially viable platforms eventually made personal computer platforms very popular.

<doc id="418611" wikidata="Q1345971" url="?curid=418611" title="Gannett">
<text>Gannett Co., Inc. () is an American mass media holding company headquartered in New York City. It is the largest U.S. newspaper publisher as measured by total daily circulation.

It owns the national newspaper &quot;USA Today&quot;, as well as several local newspapers, including the &quot;Austin American-Statesman;&quot; &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;; &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot;; &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;; &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot;; &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot; in Jacksonville, Florida; &quot;The Tallahassee Democrat&quot; in Tallahassee, Florida; &quot;The Tennessean&quot; in Nashville, Tennessee; &quot;The Daily News Journal&quot;, in Murfreesboro, Tennessee; &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; in Louisville, Kentucky; the &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; in Rochester, New York; &quot;The Des Moines Register&quot;; the &quot;El Paso Times&quot;; &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; in Phoenix, Arizona;&quot; The News-Press&quot; in Fort Myers, Florida; the&quot; Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot;; the &quot;Argus Leader&quot;; &quot;the Pueblo Chieftain&quot;; and the &quot;Great Falls Tribune&quot;.

In 2015, Gannett split into two publicly traded companies, one focusing on newspapers and publishing and the other on broadcasting. The broadcasting company took the name Tegna, and owns about 68 TV stations. The newspaper company inherited the Gannett name. The split was structured so that Tegna is the legal successor of the old Gannett, while the new Gannett is a spin-off.

In November 2019, New Media Investment Group acquired and merged its GateHouse Media subsidiary into Gannett, creating the largest newspaper publisher in the United States, which adopted the Gannett name. Mike Reed was named CEO.

Gannett along with 91 additional &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies had &quot;paid an effective federal tax rate of 0% or less&quot; in 2018 as a result of Donald Trump´s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

==History==
===1906–1983===
Gannett Company, Inc. was formed in 1923 by Frank Gannett in Rochester, New York, as an outgrowth of the &quot;Elmira Gazette&quot;, a newspaper business he had begun in Elmira, New York, in 1906. Gannett, who was known as a conservative, gained fame and fortune by purchasing small independent newspapers and developing them into a large chain, a 20th-century trend that helped the newspaper industry remain financially viable.

In April 1957, Paul Miller succeeded Frank Gannett as president and CEO when the group held 19 newspapers over four states; Florida not among them. Miller became frustrated after repeated unsuccessful attempts to acquire a foothold in Florida, then targeted Brevard County. He spoke to Marie Holderman, the owner and publisher of the &quot;Cocoa Tribune&quot;, and shared his plan for a morning daily paper in Brevard County. Holderman was not interested. Over the next few years, several Gannett representatives attempted to negotiate a purchase, without success.

In the late 1950s, Al Neuharth was assistant managing editor at the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; and became acquainted with Marie Holderman. In 1963, he was hired by Miller to manage the &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; in Rochester, New York. Two years later, he asked Miller for an opportunity to persuade Holderman. 
In their meeting, Neuharth complimented the &quot;Tribune&quot;, but told Holderman that she lacked the resources to win a competition. Holderman was invited to Rochester for a meeting to talk with Gannett executives. The Gannett corporate airplane flew four people from Florida to New York.

John Pound, managing editor joined Holderman and her two granddaughters on the trip in May 1965. Convinced of Gannett&#x27;s determination and at age 81, Holderman decided to sell, and Pound told the executives they wanted $1.9 million in compensation. Neuharth&#x27;s response: &quot;We told them that was a fair price and we certainly paid her more than she expected to get.&quot;
In 1966, Neuharth took charge of Gannett Florida. After a few months, the Hudson family in Titusville decided to sell the &quot;Star Advocate&quot; to Gannett for $1 million.

Neuharth started &quot;Today&quot; in Cocoa, which eventually became &quot;Florida Today&quot;. By June 1966, paid subscriptions were 33,000, far exceeding their goal of 20,000 by the end of the year. The paper became profitable in 1968 after just 33 months.

Miller was succeeded by Al Neuharth in 1973.

In 1978, Gannett acquired Combined Communications Corp., operator of 2 major daily newspapers, the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; and &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, seven television stations, 13 radio stations, as well as an outdoor advertising division, for $370 million. The outdoor advertising became known as Gannett Outdoor, before being acquired by Outdoor Systems (previously a division of 3M), before the company was sold to Infinity Broadcasting, which later became part of Viacom, and was part of CBS Corporation, until 2014 when CBS Outdoor went independent and became Outfront Media.

&quot;The News Journal&quot; in Wilmington, Delaware was purchased from DuPont and &quot;The Tennessean&quot; in Nashville in 1979, when the chain had grown to 79 newspapers. In 1982, the broadcasting unit partnered with Telepictures Corporation to start out its Newscope program.

Gannett&#x27;s oldest newspaper is the &quot;Berrow&#x27;s Worcester Journal&quot; based in Worcester, England and founded in 1690. In the United States, the oldest newspapers still in circulation are the &quot;Poughkeepsie Journal&quot;, founded in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1785, and &quot;The Leaf-Chronicle&quot; founded in Clarksville, Tennessee in 1808.

===1984–2013===
In 1984, John Curley was appointed president and COO. In 1985, Curley became CEO and continued as president.

The company was headquartered in Rochester until 1986, when it moved to Arlington County, Virginia. Its former headquarters building, the Gannett Building, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

Douglas H. McCorkindale succeeded Curley as CEO in 2000 and chairman in 2001. That year, the company moved to its headquarters in Tysons Corner, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C.

Beginning in 2005 at the Fort Myers &quot;News-Press&quot;, Gannett pioneered the mojo concept of &quot;mo&quot;bile multimedia &quot;jo&quot;urnalists, reporters who were initially untethered from conventional newsrooms and drove around their communities filing hyperlocal news in various formats including text for print publication, still photos for print and online publication, and audio and video for the &quot;News-Press&quot; website. The practice has spread throughout the chain.

In 2010, Gannett increased executive salaries and bonuses; for example, Bob Dickey, Gannett&#x27;s U.S. newspapers division president, was paid $3.4 million in 2010, up from $1.9 million the previous year. The next year, the company laid off 700 U.S. employees to cut costs. In the memo announcing the layoffs, Dickey wrote, &quot;While we have sought many ways to reduce costs, I regret to tell you that we will not be able to avoid layoffs.&quot;
On March 7, 2011, Gannett replaced the stylized &quot;G&quot; logo in use since the 1970s (notably used on its TV stations as a corporate/local ID with different animations), and adopted a new company tagline: &quot;It&#x27;s all within reach.&quot;

In February 2012, Gannett announced that it would implement a paywall system across all of its daily newspaper websites, with non-subscriber access limited to between five and fifteen articles per month, varying by newspaper. The &quot;USA Today&quot; website became the only one to allow unrestricted access.

On March 24, 2012, the company announced that it would discipline 25 employees in Wisconsin who had signed the petition to recall Governor Scott Walker, stating that this open public participation in a political process was a violation of the company&#x27;s code of journalistic ethics and that their primary responsibility as journalists was to maintain credibility and public trust in themselves and the organization.

On August 21, 2012, Gannett acquired Blinq Media.

Around the first week of October 2012, Gannett entered a dispute against Dish Network regarding compensation fees and Dish&#x27;s AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper digital video recorders. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for Gannett&#x27;s television stations. Gannett threatened to pull all of its stations should the skirmish continue beyond October 7, and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement. The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.

===Acquisition of Belo Corporation, 2013===

On June 13, 2013, Gannett announced plans to buy Dallas-based Belo Corporation for $1.5 billion and the assumption of debt. The purchase would add 20 additional stations to Gannett&#x27;s portfolio and make the company the fourth largest television broadcaster in the U.S. with 43 stations. Because of ownership conflicts that exist in markets where both Belo and Gannett own television stations and newspapers, the use of a third-party company (Sander Media, LLC, owned by former Belo executive Jack Sander) as a licensee to buy stations to be operated by the owner of a same-market competitor and concerns about any possible future consolidation of operations of Gannett- and Belo-owned properties in markets where both own television stations or collusion involving the Gannett and Sander stations in retransmission consent negotiations, anti-media-consolidation groups (such as Free Press) and pay television providers (such as Time Warner Cable and DirecTV) have called for the FCC to block the acquisition.

On December 16, 2013, the United States Department of Justice announced that Gannett, Belo, and Sander would need to divest Belo&#x27;s station in St. Louis, KMOV, to a government-approved third-party that would be barred from entering into any agreements with Gannett, in order to fully preserve competition in advertising sales with Gannett-owned KSDK. The deal was approved by the FCC on December 20, and it was completed on December 23. On February 28, 2014, Meredith Corporation officially took over full control of KMOV.

===Acquisition of London Broadcasting Company stations, 2014===
On May 14, 2014, Gannett announced the acquisition of six stations from the Texas-based London Broadcasting Company in a $215 million deal, including KCEN-TV (NBC) in Waco-Temple-Bryan, KYTX (CBS) in Tyler-Longview, KIII (ABC) in Corpus Christi, KBMT (ABC/NBC) in Beaumont-Port Arthur, KXVA (FOX) in Abilene-Sweetwater and KIDY (FOX) in San Angelo. The company&#x27;s COO Phil Hurley will also join Gannett to continue his leadership role at the six stations. The acquisition was completed on July 8, 2014; in total, Gannett stations now serve 83% of households in the state. Post acquisition, Gannett now outright owns and operates their first Fox affiliates, KIDY &amp; KXVA.

===Split and further deals, 2014-2018===
On August 5, 2014, Gannett announced that it plans to split into two independent publicly traded companies–one focused on newspapers and publishing, the other on broadcasting. Robert Dickey, head of old Gannett&#x27;s newspaper division, became CEO of the newspaper company, leaving Gannett&#x27;s remaining broadcasting and digital operations under the leadership of Martore. In a statement, she explained that the split plans were &quot;significant next steps in our ongoing initiatives to increase shareholder value by building scale, increasing cash flow, sharpening management focus, and strengthening all of our businesses to compete effectively in today&#x27;s increasingly digital landscape.&quot; Additionally, the company announced that it would buy out the remainder of Classified Ventures—a joint venture between Gannett and several other media companies, for $1.8 billion, giving it full ownership of properties such as Cars.com. On April 21, 2015, Gannett announced that the publishing arm would continue to use the Gannett name, while the broadcasting and digital company would be named Tegna—an anagram of Gannett. The split was completed on June 29, 2015. The split was structured so that the old Gannett changed its name to Tegna, and then spun off its publishing interests as a &quot;new&quot; Gannett Company. Tegna retained &quot;old&quot; Gannett&#x27;s stock price history under a new ticker symbol, TGNA, while &quot;new&quot; Gannett inherited &quot;old&quot; Gannett&#x27;s ticker symbol, GCI.

The two companies shared a headquarters complex in Tysons Corner for a time, though Tegna has since moved to a new 440,000-square-foot office tower nearby, occupying roughly 60,000 square feet.

On October 7, 2015, Gannett struck a deal to buy the Journal Media Group for $280 million, giving it control of publications in over 100 markets in the Midwestern and Southern U.S. Similar to what Gannett had earlier done with its broadcasting assets, the Milwaukee-based Journal had separated its publishing and broadcasting arms in April 2015, with the E. W. Scripps Company acquiring the television and radio properties owned by the former&#x27;s technical predecessor Journal Communications and spinning out their respective publishing operations into Journal Media Group. In December 2015, Gannett announced that its local newspapers would be branded as the &quot;USA Today Network&quot;, signifying a closer association with the national USA Today paper.

In April 2016, Gannett made an unsolicited bid to acquire the Tribune Publishing Company for $12.25 per-share, or around $400 million. This deal was rejected by Tribune&#x27;s shareholders in May 2016; in turn, Gannett increased its offer to around $15 per-share (around $800 million). Although the two companies held talks during the summer and into the fall of 2016, disappointing earning reports for Gannett for the second and third quarters of 2016 caused Gannett to pull out of talks on November 1.

Gannett announced it would not be delaying print deadlines for the 2018 midterm elections in the United States, meaning that next-day newspapers would no longer contain the election&#x27;s results, instead directing readers to the Internet.

=== Sale to GateHouse Media and relationship with Softbank, 2019 ===

In January 2019, Digital First Media (DFM) made an unsolicited bid to acquire Gannett for $1.36 billion, but it was rejected for being undervalued. In an attempt to pursue a hostile takeover, DFM built up a 7.5% stake of Gannett&#x27;s public shares. Gannett subsequently accused the company of engaging in a proxy fight. After a failed attempt to place three DFM nominees on Gannett&#x27;s board of directors through a proxy vote on May 16, 2019, DFM sold shares lowering their ownership to 4.2%.

On August 5, 2019, New Media Investment Group, parent of GateHouse Media, announced that it would acquire Gannett. New Media Investment Group was managed by a private equity firm, Fortress Investment Group. Fortress was owned until May 2024, by the Japanese conglomerate Softbank. Apollo Global Management funded the acquisition with a $1.792 billion loan. Although GateHouse was the nominal survivor, the combined company took the better-known Gannett name. Michael E. Reed, the CEO of GateHouse&#x27;s parent company, was named CEO. The new management team immediately announced it would target &quot;inefficiencies&quot;, which could lead to cutbacks at newspapers and reduction in newspaper staff.

In December 2019, CNBC listed Gannett along with 91 additional &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies that &quot;paid an effective federal tax rate of 0% or less&quot; in 2028 as a result of Donald Trump´s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

As of 2022, Gannett&#x27;s board of directors, which does not include anyone with journalism background, paid CEO Mike Reed a salary $900,000 and long term stock incentives adding to a total of $7.7 million in 2021, the first full year after the merger. The total compensation was estimated with Gannett stock valued at the then current price. During Reed&#x27;s tenure, Gannett stock has fallen 70%, reducing the value of future equity incentive plan awards.

=== Sued for enabling sexual abuse of paperboys in 1970s New York and Arizona, 2019 ===
In 2019, Gannett was sued under the New York State Child Victim&#x27;s Act by a former paperboy who accused the company of enabling a former district manager to sexually abuse him in the 1980s. In late 2018 as Gannett was seeking partners for a merger, fending off a hostile takeover and its stock fell, this former paperboy emailed investigative reporters and Gannett management asking them to investigate his claims. In response, Karen Magnuson, then Executive Editor for Gannett&#x27;s &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot;, told reporters to put their investigative reporting of abuse claims on &quot;pause&quot;, and brought the email to the attention of Gannett&#x27;s management to conduct their own investigation.

Gannett chief operating officer Michael G. Kane sent the original claimant a letter indicating no evidence had been found and they were &quot;closing out&quot; the matter. A few months later New York passed its Child Victim Act lifting statute of limitations on child sex abuse claims. Four more lawsuits were filed in February 2020 Additionally, three more men filed suit against Gannett for child sex abuse in September 2020 and April 2021;

In December 2020, Gannett and its &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; newspaper were sued by two former paperboys in the Phoenix, Arizona community for enabling its employees to sexually abuse them in the late 1970s. As the New York state window to file under its Childs Victim Act closed in August 2021, another man sued Gannett in Rochester, New York, alleging child sex abuse by the same former district manager of paperboys. This latest case brings the total to eleven men who are suing Gannett for enabling sexual abuse of former paperboys, some as young as eleven at the time.

Nearly three years after the first lawsuit filing, in July 2022, Gannett defense attorneys notified the court of their intent to file a motion to have the former paperboys&#x27; Child Victims Act cases taken &quot;out of the state court system and turn them over to the New York Workers&#x27; Compensation Board&quot; stating that the 11–14-year-old paperboys should have applied for workman&#x27;s compensation at the time of their injuries in the 1980s or upon enactment of the CVA in 2019. In December 2022, presiding Judge, Deborah A. Chimes acquiesced to Gannett&#x27;s demands that NY Workers Compensation Board – despite the existence of the Child Victims Act as NY State law – determine if Plaintiffs have a valid cause of action for damages or whether they are limited to benefits under the Worker’s Compensation Law. This despite the fact that the Workers Compensation Board has no mechanism to consider this question of justice and legal rights, as the Board is tasked by the state of New York solely to: &quot; administer workers’ compensation, disability benefits and Paid Family Leave.&quot; On July 26, 2024, this demand of Gannett, received and accepted fully by Judge Deborah Chimes, was reversed, by the Fourth Judicial Department of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court. The nine plaintiff cases remain pending action by Judge Chimes and her court.

===COVID-19, 2020===
In March 2020, Gannett announced that due to COVID-19, it will be forced to make a series of cuts and furloughs. Executives would also take a 25% reduction in salary.

===Reduction of editorial content, 2022- 2024===

In April 2022, a committee of Gannett editors made the formal recommendation that newspapers in the chain should significantly pare back the opinion material that newspapers traditionally publish on their editorial pages, including editorials, op-ed columns, syndicated columns and editorial cartoons. According to the company-wide memo, &quot;Readers don&#x27;t want us to tell them what to think. They don&#x27;t believe we have the expertise to tell anyone what to think on most issues. They perceive us as having a biased agenda.&quot; The memo additionally claimed that editorial content is the least-read content in the papers while being the most likely reason someone gives for cancelling a subscription.

In March 2024, the company announced that effective March 25, it would end its legacy Associated Press premium subscription, meaning it would no longer pay to publish AP dispatches, photos and video from the wire service in Gannett-owned publications. According to a statement from the company, this decision, regarded by observers as a cost-cutting move, &quot;will give us the opportunity to redeploy more dollars toward our teams and build capacity where we might have gaps.&quot;

In that same memo, Gannett said it signed an agreement with Reuters to publish the newswire&#x27;s global content. Gannett will continue to pay AP for its election-related polling and vote-counting, and pay to access the AP Stylebook. Gannet&#x27;s contract with AP was set to expire at the end of 2024. It is unclear why the company ended the agreement early or how much it was paying AP.

===Financial conditions and layoffs 2022===

In the second quarter of 2022, Gannett&#x27;s revenue was $749 million, sustaining a loss of $54 million. In reaction to the news, the company announced, &quot;In the coming days, we will be making necessary but painful reductions to staffing, eliminating some open positions and roles that will impact valued colleagues.&quot;
 At the end of August, the company announced that it was laying off 3% of its United States workforce, which was about 400 employees. At this announcement, Gannett also said they would not be filling 400 open positions.

At the time of the announcement, Gannett stock, which was already down about 45% on the year, fell an additional 28.5%.

In October, the company announced the second round of financial austerity steps. These included the requirement that all employees take a week of unpaid leave in December, and a suspension of matching contributions to employee 401(k) accounts. Gannett also instituted a hiring freeze and is seeking volunteers for buyouts.

Gannett announced around 200 more layoffs, or 6% of the news division, in November 2022.

As part of the cuts, Gannett stopped printing six community papers, collectively known as the Observer and Eccentric chain, in southeast Michigan, including the print editions of the &quot;Livonia Observer&quot; and papers covering Westland, Farmington, Plymouth, Canton, and Birmingham. Gannett indicated that the publications would provide online content.

The USA Today Network is the largest local-to-national publishing organization in the country according to Gannett. &quot;USA Today&quot;, as the national paper, is its flagship brand. The network uses reporting from local publications in the national publication and vice versa.

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2021, it included local papers published by Gannett in 46 states. In 2023, the network hired dedicated reporters to cover Taylor Swift and Beyonce.

Gannett acknowledged in 2021 that it provided advertisers with inaccurate information for nine months misrepresenting where billions of ads were placed.

In February 2024, Gannett moved out of its headquarters and planned to relocate to a 24,000-square-foot leased office space in New York City starting March 31.

<text>In mathematical analysis, Parseval&#x27;s identity, named after Marc-Antoine Parseval, is a fundamental result on the summability of the Fourier series of a function. The identity asserts the equality of the energy of a periodic signal (given as the integral of the squared amplitude of the signal) and the energy of its frequency domain representation (given as the sum of squares of the amplitudes). Geometrically, it is a generalized Pythagorean theorem for inner-product spaces (which can have an uncountable infinity of basis vectors).

The identity asserts that the sum of squares of the Fourier coefficients of a function is equal to the integral of the square of the function,
formula_1
where the Fourier coefficients formula_2 of formula_3 are given by
formula_4

The result holds as stated, provided formula_3 is a square-integrable function or, more generally, in &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; space formula_6 A similar result is the Plancherel theorem, which asserts that the integral of the square of the Fourier transform of a function is equal to the integral of the square of the function itself. In one-dimension, for formula_7
formula_8

== Generalization of the Pythagorean theorem ==

The identity is related to the Pythagorean theorem in the more general setting of a separable Hilbert space as follows. Suppose that formula_9 is a Hilbert space with inner product formula_10 Let formula_11 be an orthonormal basis of formula_9; i.e., the linear span of the formula_13 is dense in formula_14 and the formula_13 are mutually orthonormal:
:formula_16

Then Parseval&#x27;s identity asserts that for every formula_17
formula_18

This is directly analogous to the Pythagorean theorem, which asserts that the sum of the squares of the components of a vector in an orthonormal basis is equal to the squared length of the vector. One can recover the Fourier series version of Parseval&#x27;s identity by letting formula_9 be the Hilbert space formula_20 and setting formula_21 for formula_22

More generally, Parseval&#x27;s identity holds for arbitrary Hilbert spaces, not necessarily separable. When the Hilbert space is not separable any orthonormal basis is uncountable and we need to generalize the concept of a series to an unconditional sum as follows: let formula_23 an orthonormal basis of a Hilbert space (where formula_24 have arbitrary cardinality), then we say that formula_25 converges unconditionally if for every formula_26 there exists a finite subset formula_27 such that
formula_28
for any pair of finite subsets formula_29 that contains formula_30 (that is, such that formula_31). Note that in this case we are using a net to define the unconditional sum.

<text>Nordre Aker (Northern Aker) is a borough of the city of Oslo, Norway.

==History==
This area became part of the city of Oslo in 1948. Before that it was a part of the former Aker municipality in Akershus county.

==Demographics and housing==
With a population of 52,327 (1 January 2020) Nordre Aker ranks fifth among the boroughs.

Detached housing dominates the western part of the borough. There are also high-rise student blocks at several locations, including Vestgrensa, Sogn, Fjellbirkeland and Kringsjå.

==Geography==
The borough is north of the city centre, and represents the last major settlement before the northern forested area starts. It is bordered by Marka in the north and east, Vestre Aker in the west, Frogner in the southwest, St. Hanshaugen, Sagene and a small part of Grünerløkka in the south and Bjerke in the east.

The borough consists of several neighborhoods, from west to east: Gaustad, Øvre Blindern, Ullevål Hageby, Sogn, Kringsjå, Nordberg, Korsvoll, Tåsen, Ullevål, Berg, Nydalen, Storo, Frysja, Disen, Kjelsås, Grefsen and Nordre Åsen.

The major body of water in the borough is the river Akerselva. The western border of the borough is formed by a creek, Sognsvannsbekken. The lake Sognsvann is not located in Nordre Aker, albeit the parking lot and metro leading to it is.

==Transportation==
The area is well covered with public transportation. Part of the Sognsvann Line of the Oslo Metro is in Nordre Aker, exactly beginning at the station Blindern in the south to the terminus Sognsvann in the north. The line runs northeast from Blindern, but between Berg and Tåsen it turns to the northwest and north. At the station Forskningsparken the Sognsvann Line overpasses the light rail Ullevål Hageby Line, which comes from the southeast. The terminus of this line being John Colletts plass for many years, it was extended to Rikshospitalet in 1999.

Branching off from the Sognsvann Line between Ullevål stadion and Berg since 2006 is the Ring Line of the Metro. The Ring Line stops at Nydalen before heading southwards and converging with the borough border towards St. Hanshaugen. The station Storo is on the border between the boroughs. Storo is also a light rail station; the terminus of the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line and the start of the Kjelsås Line. Opened in 1934, the Kjelsås Line runs northwards towards the terminus at Kjelsås. Lastly, Kjelsås is also a station on the Gjøvik Line railway, so is Nydalen. The Gjøvik Line runs from Storo via Akerselva towards Kjelsås, and northwards into Marka.

Road transport is also important in the borough. The largest ring road in the city, Ring 3, cuts through Nordre Aker. The portion of Ring 3 located in Nordre Aker starts, in the west, exactly at the underpass of Gaustadalléen under Ring 3 (at Gaustadalléen station), and ends in the east at the Sinsen Interchange. It runs eastward until after Nydalen, when it turns steeply to the south. The road it crosses at the Sinsen Interchange is not located in Nordre Aker.

==Culture==
The local newspaper is &quot;Nordre Aker Budstikke&quot;. It is distributed freely and weekly. Also, student newspapers such as &quot;Universitas&quot; are headquartered in the borough; &quot;Universitas&quot; is also distributed to institutions in other boroughs.

===Sports===
Nordre Aker is best known as the site of Ullevål Stadion, the stadium of the Norway national football team. Tenants on club level have been Vålerenga Fotball, and FK Lyn before the latter club faced a series of relegations. Vålerenga originally has no connection to Nordre Aker, whereas Lyn origins from the north of the borough, around Kringsjå. Ullevål is traditionally the area of Ullevål IL, and though this club has dropped association football from its programme, it operates the bandy field Bergbanen adjacent to Ullevål Stadion. Other bandy clubs in the borough are Tåsen IL and Skeid Bandy. Skeid Bandy, a part of the multi-sports-club Skeid, has a headquarters at Nordre Åsen, but the club has a geographic connection to Sagene borough. Lyn is also a multi-sports club, SFK Lyn, which in addition to football is involved in Nordic skiing. Other skiing clubs in the borough are IL Koll (which also professes in volleyball), Kjelsås IL (which also professes in football) and Nydalen SK (which also professes in orienteering). Korsvoll IL is best known for football and handball. IK Akerselva is a floorball club competing on the highest national level.

In addition, the students&#x27; sports club Oslostudentenes IK (OSI) has a connection to Nordre Aker, as it uses the indoor arena Domus Athletica in Ullevål Hageby, although the club originated in Sentrum in the milieu of the old university campus. Domus Athletica is owned by, and houses the headquarters of, the Foundation for Student Life in Oslo.

Track and field athletics is weak as far as clubs go; Koll, OSI, Lyn and Kjelsås are minor clubs. On the other hand, the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences (see also Education) includes a multi-use indoor arena as well as a red rubber track, tennis fields, ice sports fields, football fields, a bobsleigh training track and more. The facilities at the School of Sports Sciences are used by national and international sportspeople, much because the national Olympic training scheme, Olympiatoppen and the elite sports centre, Toppidrettssenteret are located north of the School of Sports Sciences.

Federations such as the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports, the Football Association of Norway and the Norwegian Athletics Association are headquartered in &quot;Idrettens Hus&quot; at Ullevål Stadion.

==Churches and hospitals==
The &quot;National Hospital&quot; of Norway, Rikshospitalet, was moved to Gaustad in 2000. Its location is west across the street of Gaustad Hospital, founded in 1855. Gaustad was originally chosen as a location because of the rural seclusion of the time. Inhabitants in the east of Nordre Aker live closer to Aker Hospital, but this hospital is located slightly outside the borough.

In the Church of Norway, Nordre Aker is a deanery whose borders does not correspond with the borough border (they are more widespread). The parishes in the deanery are Torshov, Tonsen, Sofienberg, Paulus, Lilleborg, Sagene, Iladalen and Grefsen.

==Education and business==
Nordre Aker is the center of higher education in Oslo and therefore Norway, with the main campus of the University of Oslo located at Blindern since the post-war years. In addition, there is a campus for medicine and odontology at Rikshospitalet, and buildings belonging to the University in Forskningsparken (&quot;the Research Park&quot;) northwest of Blindern. In addition, the Norwegian School of Management is headquartered in Nydalen since 2005. Near Sognsvann, the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences is located. A newer institution of higher education is the Norwegian College of Acupuncture. Other institutions in the area include the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and the National Archival Services of Norway.

Upper secondary schools in the borough are Blindern and Nydalen. One folk high school, Rønningen Folk High School, is located in the extreme northeast of the borough.

Forskningsparken contains several research-based businesses, but these are located outside of the borough. Major commercial buildings include Sogn Arena, owned by Bertel O. Steen Eiendom. Major shopping malls in the vicinity are Ullevål Stadion Shopping, Tåsen Senter and Storo Storsenter.

==Politics==
As a borough of Oslo, Nordre Aker is governed by the city council of Oslo (in a parliamentary system) as well as its own borough council. The borough council leader is Bent Gether-Rønning from the Conservative Party, and the deputy leader is Erik Borge Skei of the Liberal Party. The 15 seats are distributed among the following political parties:

*1 from the Socialist Left Party (&quot;Sosialistisk Folkeparti&quot;)
*5 from the Labour Party (&quot;Arbeiderpartiet&quot;)
*2 from the Liberal Party (&quot;Venstre&quot;)
*6 from the Conservative Party (&quot;Høyre&quot;)
*1 from the Progress Party (&quot;Fremskrittspartiet&quot;)

<text>Francisco González Bocanegra (January 8, 1824 – April 11, 1861) was a Mexican poet who wrote the lyrics of the Mexican National Anthem in 1853.

He was born in San Luis Potosí, San Luis Potosí to Spanish soldier José María González Yáñez and Francisca Bocanegra y Villalpando, sister of the Foreign Relations Secretary under President Vicente Guerrero, José María Bocanegra. Despite his father being exempted because of being married to a Mexican, in 1827, his family moved to Spain after a law was enacted expelling all remaining Spanish citizens in the country. They settled in the port of Cádiz until the family returned to San Luis Potosí on December 28, 1836.

He died in 1861 and is interred at the Rotunda of Illustrious Persons.

==Writing of the Mexican national anthem==
On November 12, 1853, President Antonio López de Santa Anna announced a competition to write a national anthem for Mexico. The competition offered a prize for the best poetic composition representing patriotic ideals. González, a talented poet, was not interested in participating in the competition. He argued that writing love poems involved very different skills from the ones required to write a national anthem. His fiancée, Guadalupe González del Pino (or Pili), had undaunted faith in her fiancé&#x27;s poetic skills and was displeased with his constant refusal to participate in spite of her constant prodding and requests from their friends. Under false pretenses, she lured him to a secluded bedroom in her parents&#x27; house, locked him into the room, and refused to let him out until he produced an entry for the competition. Inside the room in which he was temporarily imprisoned were pictures depicting various events in Mexican history which helped to inspire his work. After four hours of fluent (albeit forced) inspiration, Francisco regained his freedom by slipping all ten verses of his creation under the door. After Francisco received approval from his fiancée and her father, he submitted the poem and won the competition by unanimous vote. González was announced the winner in the publication Official Journal of the Federation (DOF) on February 3, 1854.

In 1943, six of González&#x27;s ten verses were cut from the official full national anthem, leaving his chorus and stanzas 1, 5, 6, and 10.

<doc id="418623" wikidata="Q543157" url="?curid=418623" title="S-type asteroid">
<text>S-type (stony-type or silicaceous-type) asteroids are asteroids with a spectral type that is indicative of a siliceous (i.e. stony) mineralogical composition, hence the name. They have relatively high density. Approximately 17% of asteroids are of this type, making it the second-most common after the carbonaceous C-type.

== Characteristics ==
S-type asteroids, with an astronomical albedo of typically 0.20, are moderately bright and consist mainly of iron- and magnesium-silicates. They are dominant in the inner part of the asteroid belt within 2.2 AU, common in the central belt within about 3 AU, but become rare farther out. The largest are 3 Juno (about 240–250 km across) and 15 Eunomia (230 km), with other large S-types being 29 Amphitrite, 532 Herculina and 7 Iris. These largest S-types are visible in 10x50 binoculars at most oppositions; the brightest, 7 Iris, can occasionally become brighter than +7.0, which is a higher magnitude than any asteroid except the unusually reflective 4 Vesta.

Their spectrum has a moderately steep slope at wavelengths shorter than 0.7 micrometres (μm), and has moderate to weak absorption features around 1 μm and 2 μm. The 1 μm absorption is indicative of the presence of silicates (stony minerals). Often there is also a broad but shallow absorption feature centered near 0.63 μm. The composition of these asteroids is similar to a variety of stony meteorites which share similar spectral characteristics.

Due to their volatile-poor (rocky) composition, S-type asteroids have relatively high density. A survey of 11 S-type asteroids found an average density of .

== S-group asteroids ==

=== SMASS classification ===

In the SMASS classification, several generally &quot;stony&quot; types of asteroids are brought together into a wider S-group which contains the following types:
* A-type
* K-type
* L-type
* Q-type
* R-type
* a &quot;core&quot; S-type for asteroids having the most typical spectra for the S-group
* Sa, Sk, Sl, Sq, and Sr-types containing transition objects between the core S-type and the A, K, L, Q, and R-types, respectively. The entire &quot;S&quot;-assemblage of asteroids is spectrally quite distinct from the carbonaceous C-group and the often metallic X-group.

=== Tholen classification ===

In the Tholen classification, the S-type is a very broad grouping which includes all the types in the SMASS S-group except for the A, Q, and R, which have particularly strong &quot;stony&quot; absorption features around 1 μm.

=== Stony asteroid families ===
Prominent stony asteroid families with their typical albedo are the:
* Eos family (0.14)
* Eunomia family (0.21)
* Flora family (0.24)
* Koronis family (0.24)
* Nysa family (0.20)
* Phocaea family (0.23)

<text>Martin Fitzgerald Lawrence (born April 16, 1965) is an American actor and comedian. He came to fame during the 1990s, establishing a Hollywood career as a leading actor. He got his start playing Maurice Warfield in &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot; (1987–1988), and is known for his lead performance in the Fox television sitcom &quot;Martin,&quot; as well as the &quot;Bad Boys&quot; film franchise. His other films include &quot;House Party&quot;, &quot;Boomerang&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Blue Streak&quot;, &quot;Big Momma&#x27;s House&quot;, &quot;Open Season&quot;, and &quot;Wild Hogs&quot;.

==Early life==
The fourth of six children, Martin Fitzgerald Lawrence was born on April 16, 1965, in Frankfurt, West Germany. His father, John Lawrence, was serving in the U.S. military at the time of his birth. Lawrence&#x27;s first and middle names were after civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and U.S. President John F. Kennedy, respectively. When Lawrence was seven, his father left the military, and the family moved from West Germany back to the United States, settling in the Washington D.C. area in the town of Landover, Maryland. Lawrence&#x27;s mother had moved herself and her six children into the troubled King Square housing projects where he would attend Dodge Park Elementary. Following his parents&#x27; divorce when he was eight years old, Lawrence rarely saw his father, who was a police officer, serving as the Police Chief for the Franklin D. Roosevelt VA Medical Center in Montrose, New York. His mother, Chlora (née Bailey), worked several jobs, including as a sales representative and cashier at various department stores, to support her family.
Small for his size growing up in the projects, Lawrence often engaged in street fights with other kids. He stated that it was his mother and older brothers who kept him out of jail where most of his childhood friends ended up. During his teen years, Lawrence excelled at boxing. While living in Fort Washington, Maryland, Lawrence attended Eleanor Roosevelt High School and Friendly High School, and became a Mid-Atlantic Golden Gloves boxing contender.

==Career==

In his early days, Lawrence did comedy shows in the Washington, D.C., area and supported himself through odd jobs. Comedian Ritch Shydner saw his act and suggested Lawrence make connections in New York. Lawrence ended up moving to New York City and found his way to the comedy club &quot;The Improv&quot;. Shortly after appearing at The Improv, Lawrence won a performance spot on &quot;Star Search&quot;. He did well on the show and made it to the final round, but did not win. However, executives at Columbia Pictures Television saw Martin&#x27;s performance and offered him the role of Maurice Warfield in &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot;; this was his first acting job. Upon cancellation of that show, Lawrence found bit parts in various films and television series. His breakthrough role was as Cee in &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;. Other film roles followed, such as &quot;House Party&quot;, &quot;House Party 2&quot;, &quot;Talkin&#x27; Dirty After Dark&quot;, and the Eddie Murphy vehicle &quot;Boomerang&quot;. During this period, entertainment mogul Russell Simmons selected him to host the groundbreaking series &quot;Def Comedy Jam&quot; on HBO. &quot;Def Comedy Jam&quot; gave many comedians (including Chris Tucker, Dave Chappelle, Mike Epps, Eddie Griffin, Bernie Mac and Cedric the Entertainer) mainstream exposure.

During his stint with &quot;Def Comedy Jam&quot;, Lawrence appeared in his own hit series, &quot;Martin&quot;, which aired on Fox. The show ran from 1992 to 1997 and was an enormous success. &quot;Martin&quot; was the flagship of Fox&#x27;s Thursday night line-up, which drew millions of viewers away from NBC&#x27;s &quot;Must See TV&quot; line-up. He hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on February 19, 1994, where he made crude remarks about women&#x27;s genitalia and personal hygiene; the offensive portion of the monologue was edited out of NBC reruns and syndicated versions and Lawrence was banned from NBC for a period of time until he received an apology from the President of NBC at the time Warren Littlefield. &quot;Martin&quot;&#x27;s ratings continued to skyrocket so much that Fox became more of a contender against NBC and came closer to being considered among the top television networks. In 1995 he acted alongside Will Smith in &quot;Bad Boys&quot; with wide success.

After &quot;Martin&quot; ended its run in 1997, Lawrence found work in comedy films. He often starred as the second lead opposite actors including Eddie Murphy, Danny DeVito, and Tim Robbins. Many of his films were blockbusters at the box office, including &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Blue Streak&quot;, &quot;Big Momma&#x27;s House&quot;, and &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;. He also starred in critical and box office failures, including &quot;Black Knight&quot; and &quot;National Security&quot;. Regardless, his salary steadily increased to over $10 million per film role. He continued to work in film, with such films as &quot;Big Momma&#x27;s House 2&quot;, which opened at No. 1 at North American box office and grossed almost $28 million its first weekend, and &quot;Wild Hogs&quot; (2007), in which he played a bored suburbanite seeking adventure on the open road in a biker comedy alongside John Travolta, Tim Allen and William H. Macy.

In 2006, Lawrence appeared on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, during which Lawrence briefly brought back to life some of the characters he had portrayed on &quot;Martin&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Open Season&quot; as the voice of Boog, one of the main characters of the film, which also starred Ashton Kutcher, Debra Messing, and Gary Sinise.

In 2008, Lawrence starred in his first G-rated film, Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; &quot;College Road Trip,&quot; in which he co-starred with Raven-Symoné.

In 2011, Lawrence reprised his role as FBI agent Malcolm Turner in &quot;Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son&quot;, the third film in the &quot;Big Momma&quot; series.

In January 2013, it was announced that Lawrence and Kelsey Grammer were considering pairing up to star in a comedy for Lionsgate Television. &quot;Partners&quot;, paired the two actors as Chicago lawyers from &quot;vastly different backgrounds who unexpectedly meet in court on the worst day of their lives.&quot; The show premiered on August 4, 2014, but was cancelled after one season after receiving poor reviews.

In 2020, Lawrence reprised his role as Detective Marcus Burnett in the third installment of the &quot;Bad Boys&quot; franchise, &quot;Bad Boys for Life&quot;, again alongside Will Smith. The film was considered a financial success, grossing $112 million in its first four days of release.

Lawrence starred in his first dramatic role in 2022&#x27;s &quot;Mindcage&quot; alongside Melissa Roxburgh and John Malkovich.

On April 20, 2023, Lawrence earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Personal life==

===Relationships and family===

Lawrence was engaged to actress Lark Voorhies in 1993. He married Miss Virginia USA, Patricia Southall, in 1995. Lawrence and Southall have a daughter, Jasmine Page (born January 15, 1996). They divorced in 1997, and Lawrence began a relationship with Shamicka Gibbs. The couple married on July 10, 2010, at Lawrence&#x27;s Beverly Hills home. Actors Eddie Murphy and Denzel Washington were among the 120 wedding guests; Lawrence and Gibbs have two daughters, Iyanna Faith (born November 9, 2000) and Amara Trinity (born August 20, 2002). On April 25, 2012, Lawrence filed for divorce from Gibbs, citing irreconcilable differences and asking for joint legal and physical custody of the children.

Lawrence owns a farm near Purcellville, Virginia. For several years, he owned a large mansion in the Beverly Park community in Beverly Hills, where he wedded Gibbs. However, following their divorce, the property was available for lease at $200,000 per month in June 2012. In 2013, the property was up for sale for $26.5 million, and eventually he sold it for $17.2 million to Bruce Makowsky, buying an Encino, Los Angeles property for $6.63 million.

=== Arrests, lawsuits and health problems ===

In July 1995, while on the set filming &quot;A Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot;, Lawrence lashed out in a violent rage and was then hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

On May 8, 1996, he became increasingly erratic and was arrested after he brandished a pistol in the middle of an intersection on Ventura Boulevard in Los Angeles, screaming, &quot;They&#x27;re trying to kill me!&quot; He was again hospitalized, with his public-relations agent citing exhaustion and dehydration as the reasons for this episode. On July 29, 1996, he tried to take a gun on a flight and received two years probation and a fine.

In January 1997, Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Martin&quot; co-star Tisha Campbell-Martin filed a lawsuit against him, alleging sexual harassment and abuse both on and off set. By April 1997, Campbell had settled the lawsuit, and returned to appear in the last two episodes of the series.

In March 1997, Lawrence was arrested after punching a man in a Hollywood nightclub.

During August 1999, Lawrence slipped into a three-day coma after collapsing from heat exhaustion while jogging in heat in preparation for &quot;Big Momma&#x27;s House&quot; while wearing heavy clothing and a &quot;plastic suit&quot;. He recovered in the hospital after entering a near fatal coma due to a body temperature of , his breathing assisted by a ventilator.

<text>Zilveren Nipkowschijf (; &quot;Silver Nipkow Disk&quot;, named for German television pioneer Paul Gottlieb Nipkow) is a Dutch television and media award that has been given out since 1961 by a selection of Dutch media journalists and critics to the best show of the year.

The three founding critics were Henk Schaafsma of NRC Handelsblad, Hans Keller of Volkskrant, and Han G. Hoekstra of Het Parool. In 1975, Stichting Nipkow was founded and became the official foundation to award the Zilveren Nipkow. Tom Smeets of De Gelderlander has been the chairman of the foundation since its foundation. In 1996, the foundation started awarding the Zilveren Reissmicrofoon to the best Dutch radio show. In 2003, the foundation introduced a new award for best multimedia presentation, which was named the Zilveren Prichettprijs (named after Harry Prichett).

<text>(North Frisian: &quot;di Ströön&quot;) is a peninsula and former island in North Frisia on the North Sea coast of Germany. It is part of the Nordfriesland district in the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein. Its area is 50 km² and its population is 2,300. Nordstrand has two municipalities, Nordstrand and smaller Elisabeth-Sophien-Koog, which are part of the &quot;Amt&quot; Nordsee-Treene.

In medieval times Nordstrand was a part of the larger island of Strand, which was torn into pieces in a disastrous storm tide in 1634. More than 6,000 people drowned. Before 1634 the area of the island was about . Other remnants of Strand are Pellworm and some Halligen islets. Similar storm surge destruction occurred in 1362 when the town of Rungholt and 28 churches (out of 59 at that time) with the associated villages perished

Nordstrand is accessible by road over a causeway, which connects to the mainland and was built in 1936. In 1987 the polder Beltringharder Koog was completed, turning the former island into a peninsula.

==Local alcoholic beverage==
Nordstrand is the origin of a locally famous alcoholic beverage, the (Pharisee), which the islanders developed in 1872 to be able to drink alcohol in the presence of local pastor Georg Bleyer, who preached abstinence. It is made from hot strong coffee, sugar, dark rum (4 cl of 54% vol.) and whipped cream (to prevent the alcohol from evaporating, so that it could not be smelled). The pastor got the only cup without rum, but one day the cups got mixed up. When he discovered the deceit he exclaimed &quot;Ihr Pharisäer!&quot; (&quot;You Pharisees!&quot;, connoting: &quot;hypocrites&quot;). Hence the name.

==North American emigrants who used it as a surname==
The original Nordstrand island (before the flood of 1634) is thought to be the ancestral homeland of the North American surname ‘van Nostrand’ (including variants: vanNostrand, vanNordstrandt, vanOstrand). Two brothers emigrated from here to what is now New York, USA, in 1637 and 1638 after the flood.
One of the three granite panels of the Canadian van Nostrand monument, in York Mill&#x27;s Cemetery, Toronto (St John’s, York Mills, Anglican Church, 19 Don Ridge Dr., North York, Toronto, Ontario), points to Nordstrand Island.

Pieter Karstense van Nortstrant was born about 1605 on the island of Norstrand. Coupled with the name of his father, Carsten or Kersten, and the fact that his children were baptized in the Lutheran Church in Amsterdam, it would seem that a German, Frisian or Danish origin is probable. It is uncertain when Pieter Karstense came to Amsterdam, possibly as a child with his father, though no record of the latter has been found there. The sons of Pieter Pietersen Ostrander (son of Pieter Karstense van Nortstrant) were called Van Norstrande or Van Nostrande, whilst Van Ostrande was used in other baptisms and eventually became the surname Oostrander and then the spelling as it is today, Ostrander.

== People from Nordstrand ==
* Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen (1834–1918), Lutheran missionary to Batak lands, North Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies (today in Indonesia), who translated the New Testament into the native Batak language and was the first &quot;Ephorus&quot; (bishop) of Batak Christian Protestant Church.
* Peter Harry Carstensen (born 1947), prime minister of the state of Schleswig-Holstein from 2005 until 2012.

<text>Nordstrand () is a borough of the city of Oslo, Norway. It borders Gamle Oslo in the north, Østensjø in the east and Søndre Nordstrand in the south.

The borough is located in the southern part of the city and with a population of 52,459 people as of 2020. In 2004, Nordstrand was merged with two other boroughs, Lambertseter and Ekeberg-Bekkelaget, to form what is today known simply as Nordstrand. First and second generation immigrants make up 14.6% of the population, which is the lowest percentage in the entire city.

The borough is named after a house named &quot;Nordstranden&quot;, located at Mosseveien 196.

Nordstrand is one of the wealthiest boroughs in Oslo, and net incomes, real estate prices, and life expectancy are among the city&#x27;s highest. In demographic statistics Oslo is usually divided into an eastern and a western part. As Nordstrand differs significantly from its bordering boroughs, it is often considered as belonging to the western part even though it is geographically located in the eastern part. Solveien, Nordstrand&#x27;s most famous road, has been one of Oslo&#x27;s most expensive addresses since the early 20th century. Nordstrand is also known for its views of the Oslofjord and its long beach.

The borough consists of these neighborhoods of Oslo:

* Nordstrand
* Bekkelaget
* Ekeberg
* Lambertseter
* Ljan

Sainte-Marie&#x27;s singing and writing repertoire includes subjects of love, war, religion, and mysticism, and her work has often focused on issues facing Indigenous peoples of the United States and Canada. She has won recognition, awards, and honors for her music as well as her work in education and social activism. In 1983, her co-written song &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot;, for the film &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 55th Academy Awards. The song also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song that same year.

Since the early 1960s, Sainte-Marie claimed Indigenous Canadian ancestry, but a 2023 investigation by CBC News concluded she was born in the United States and is of Italian and English descent. Some Indigenous musicians and organizations have since called for awards she won while falsely claiming an Indigenous identity to be rescinded, including her induction to the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. She subsequently had her Order of Canada, Canada&#x27;s highest award bestowed to a civilian, revoked in 2025 as a result.

==Early life and education==
Sainte-Marie was born at the New England Sanitarium and Hospital in Stoneham, Massachusetts, to parents Albert Santamaria and Winifred Irene Santamaria, . The Santamarias were an American couple from Wakefield, Massachusetts. Her father&#x27;s parents were born in Italy while her mother was of English ancestry. Her family changed their surname from Santamaria to the more French-sounding &quot;Sainte-Marie&quot; due to anti-Italian sentiment following the Second World War.

Sainte-Marie taught herself to play piano and guitar in her childhood and teen years. In the 1950s, Sainte-Marie attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst, earning degrees in teaching and Asian philosophy, where she says she graduated as one of the top ten students of her class.

==Career==
===1960–1979: Rise to prominence ===

During the early 60s as she attended the University of Massachusetts some of her songs, &quot;Ananias&quot;, the Indian lament &quot;Now That the Buffalo&#x27;s Gone&quot;, and &quot;Mayoo Sto Hoon&quot; (a Hindi Bollywood song &quot;Mayus To Hoon Waade Se Tere&quot; originally sung by the Indian singer Mohammed Rafi from the 1960 movie &quot;Barsaat Ki Raat&quot;) were already in her repertoire. In her early twenties she toured alone, developing her craft and performing in various concert halls, folk music festivals, and First Nations communities across the United States, Canada, and abroad. She spent a considerable amount of time in the coffeehouses of downtown Toronto&#x27;s old Yorkville district, and New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village as part of the early to mid-1960s folk scene, often alongside other emerging artists such as Leonard Cohen, Neil Young, and Joni Mitchell, the latter of whom she introduced to Elliot Roberts, who became her manager.

In 1963, recovering from a throat infection, Sainte-Marie became addicted to codeine and recovering from the experience became the basis of her song &quot;Cod&#x27;ine&quot;, later recorded by Donovan, Janis Joplin, the Charlatans, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Man, the Litter, the Leaves, Jimmy Gilmer, the Fireballs, Gram Parsons, Charles Brutus McClay, the Barracudas (spelled &quot;Codeine&quot;), the Golden Horde, Nicole Atkins and Courtney Love. Also in 1963, she witnessed wounded soldiers returning from the Vietnam War at a time when the U.S. government was denying involvement – which inspired her protest song &quot;Universal Soldier&quot;, released on her debut album &quot;It&#x27;s My Way&quot; on Vanguard Records in 1964, and later became a hit for both Donovan and Glen Campbell.

In a 1965 &quot;Billboard&quot; issue, folk-music disc jockeys voted Sainte-Marie &quot;Favorite New Female Vocalist&quot; in that genre. Some of her songs addressing the mistreatment of Native Americans, such as &quot;Now That the Buffalo&#x27;s Gone&quot; (1964) and &quot;My Country &#x27;Tis of Thy People You&#x27;re Dying&quot; (1964, included on her 1966 album), created controversy at the time. In 1967, she released &quot;Fire &amp; Fleet &amp; Candlelight&quot;, which contained her interpretation of the traditional Yorkshire dialect song &quot;Lyke Wake Dirge&quot;. In 1968 she released her song &quot;Take My Hand for a While&quot; which was also later recorded by Glen Campbell and at least 13 other artists.
Sainte-Marie&#x27;s other well-known songs include &quot;Mister Can&#x27;t You See&quot; (a Top 40 U.S. hit in 1972); &quot;He&#x27;s an Indian Cowboy in the Rodeo&quot;; and the theme song of the movie &quot;Soldier Blue&quot;. She appeared on Pete Seeger&#x27;s &quot;Rainbow Quest with Pete Seeger&quot; in 1965 and several Canadian television productions from the 1960s to the 1990s, and other TV shows such as &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Soul Train&quot;, &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Sainte-Marie sang the opening song, &quot;The Circle Game&quot; (written by Joni Mitchell), in Stuart Hagmann&#x27;s film &quot;The Strawberry Statement&quot; (1970); and in the TV show &quot;Then Came Bronson&quot; episode &quot;Mating Dance for Tender Grass&quot; (1970), she sang and portrayed Tender Grass, the episode&#x27;s titular character. In 1970 she recorded the album &quot;Illuminations&quot;, an early quadraphonic vocal album on which she used a Buchla synthesizer.

Sainte-Marie appeared in &quot;The Heritage&quot; episode of &quot;The Virginian&quot; which first aired on October 30, 1968, in which she played a Shoshone woman who had been sent to be educated at school.

===&quot;Sesame Street&quot;===
Sainte-Marie was hired in 1975 to present Native American programming for children for the first time on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Sainte-Marie wanted to teach the show&#x27;s young viewers that &quot;Indians still exist&quot;. She regularly appeared on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; over a five-year period from 1976 to 1981. Sainte-Marie breastfed her first son, Dakota &quot;Cody&quot; Starblanket Wolfchild, during a 1977 episode. Sainte-Marie has suggested that this is the first representation of breastfeeding ever aired on television.
&quot;Sesame Street&quot; filmed several shows from her home in Hawaii in 1978.

In 1979, &quot;Spirit of the Wind&quot;, featuring Sainte-Marie&#x27;s original musical score, including the song &quot;Spirit of the Wind&quot;, was shown at the Cannes Film Festival. The film is a docudrama about George Attla, a &quot;World Champion dog sledder&quot;. The American Indian Film Festival, which exhibited the film in 1980, recognizes accurate historical and contemporary portrayals of Native Americans.

===1980–1999: Established career ===
Sainte-Marie began using Apple II and Macintosh computers as early as 1981 to record her music and later some of her visual art. The song &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot; (which Sainte-Marie co-wrote with lyricist Will Jennings and musician Jack Nitzsche) was performed by Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes for the film &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;. It received the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1982. On January 29, 1983, Jennings, Nitzsche, and Sainte-Marie won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. They also won the BAFTA film award for Best Original Song in 1984. On the Songs of the Century list compiled by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2001, the song was listed at number 323. In 2020, it was included on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;25 Greatest Love Song Duets&quot;. In the early 1980s, one of her songs was used as the theme song for the CBC&#x27;s Native series &quot;Spirit Bay&quot;. She was cast for the TNT 1993 telefilm &quot;The Broken Chain&quot;. In 1989, she wrote and performed the music for &quot;Where the Spirit Lives&quot;, a film about Native children being abducted, forced into residential schools, and expected to give up their Native way of life.
In 1986, British pop band Red Box covered her song &quot;Qu&#x27;Appele Valley, Saskatchewan&quot; (shortened to just &quot;Saskatchewan&quot;) on their debut album &quot;The Circle &amp; the Square&quot;. The song appears on Sainte-Marie&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;Sweet America&quot;. Sainte-Marie voiced a Cheyenne character, Kate Bighead, in the 1991 made-for-TV movie &quot;Son of the Morning Star&quot;, telling the Indian side of the Battle of the Little Bighorn where the Sioux chief, Sitting Bull, defeated Lieutenant Colonel George Custer. In 1992, after a sixteen-year recording hiatus, Sainte-Marie released the album &quot;Coincidence and Likely Stories&quot;. Recorded in 1990 at home in Hawaii on her computer and transmitted via modem through the Internet to producer Chris Birkett in London, England, the album included the politically charged songs &quot;The Big Ones Get Away&quot; and &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; (which mentions Leonard Peltier), both commenting on the ongoing plight of Native Americans (see also the book and film with the same name&quot;)&quot;. Also in 1992, Sainte-Marie appeared in the television film &quot;The Broken Chain&quot; with Wes Studi and Pierce Brosnan along with First Nations Bahá&#x27;í Phil Lucas.

Her next album followed up in 1996 with &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot;, an album on which she re-recorded a number of her greatest hits in more unplugged and acoustic versions, including a re-release of &quot;Universal Soldier&quot;. Sainte-Marie has exhibited her art at the Glenbow Museum in Calgary, the Winnipeg Art Gallery, the Emily Carr Gallery in Vancouver and the American Indian Arts Museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In 1995, she provided the voice of the spirit in the magic mirror in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child&quot;, which featured a Native American retelling of the Snow White fairy tale. Also in 1995, the Indigo Girls released two versions of Sainte-Marie&#x27;s protest song &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; on their album &quot;1200 Curfews&quot;.

In 1996, she started the Nihewan Foundation, a philanthropic non-profit fund for American Indian Education devoted to improving Native American students&#x27; participation in learning. The word &quot;nihewan&quot; comes from the Cree language and means &quot;talk Cree&quot;, which implies &quot;be your culture&quot;. Sainte-Marie founded the Cradleboard Teaching Project in October 1996 using funds from her Nihewan Foundation and with a two-year grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation of Battle Creek, Michigan, with projects across Mohawk, Cree, Ojibwe, Menominee, Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Navajo, Quinault, Hawaiian, and Apache communities in eleven states, partnered with a non-Native class of the same grade level for Elementary, Middle, and High School grades in the disciplines of Geography, History, Social Studies, Music and Science and produced a multimedia curriculum CD, &quot;Science: Through Native American Eyes&quot;.

===2000–2023: Later work and retirement ===

In 2000, Sainte-Marie gave the commencement address at Haskell Indian Nations University. In 2002 she sang at the Kennedy Space Center for Commander John Herrington, USN, a Chickasaw and the first Native American astronaut. In 2003 she became a spokesperson for the UNESCO Associated Schools Project Network in Canada. In 2002, a track written and performed by Sainte-Marie, titled &quot;Lazarus&quot;, was sampled by Hip Hop producer Kanye West and performed by Cam&#x27;Ron and Jim Jones of The Diplomats. The track is called &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;. In June 2007, she made a rare U.S. appearance at the Clearwater Festival in Croton-on-Hudson, New York.

In 2008, a two-CD set titled &quot;Buffy/Changing Woman/Sweet America: The Mid-1970s Recordings&quot; was released, compiling the three studio albums that she recorded for ABC Records and MCA Records between 1974 and 1976 (after departing her long-time label Vanguard Records). This was the first re-release of this material. In September 2008, Sainte-Marie made a comeback onto the music scene in Canada with the release of her studio album &quot;Running for the Drum&quot;. It was produced by Chris Birkett (producer of her 1992 and 1996 best of albums). Sessions for this project commenced in 2006 in Sainte-Marie&#x27;s home studio in Hawaii and in part in France. They continued until spring 2007. In 2015, Sainte-Marie released the album &quot;Power in the Blood&quot; on True North Records. She had a television appearance on May 22, 2015, with &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; to discuss the record and her musical and activist career. On September 21, 2015, &quot;Power in the Blood&quot; was named the winner of the 2015 Polaris Music Prize. Also in 2015, A Tribe Called Red released an electronic remix of Sainte-Marie&#x27;s song, &quot;Working for the Government&quot;.

In 2016, Sainte-Marie toured North America with Mark Olexson (bass), Anthony King (guitar), Michel Bruyere (drums), and Kibwe Thomas (keyboards). In 2017, she released the single &quot;You Got to Run (Spirit of the Wind)&quot;, a collaboration with fellow Polaris Music Prize laureate, Tanya Tagaq. The song was inspired by George Attla, a champion dog sled racer from Alaska. On November 29, 2019, a 50th-anniversary edition of Sainte-Marie&#x27;s 1969 album, &quot;Illuminations&quot;, was released on vinyl by Concord Records, the company that bought Vanguard Records, the original publisher of the album. Saint-Marie is the subject of &quot;Buffy Sainte-Marie: Carry It On&quot;, a 2022 documentary film by Madison Thomas. In the same year the National Arts Centre staged &quot;Buffy Sainte-Marie: Starwalker&quot;, a tribute concert of musicians performing Sainte-Marie&#x27;s songs. On August 3, 2023, Saint-Marie issued a statement announcing her retirement from live performances, due to health concerns.

==Claim of Indigenous identity==
Sainte-Marie has claimed that she was born on the Piapot 75 reserve in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley, Saskatchewan, Canada, to Cree parents. She has also claimed that, at the age of two or three, she was taken from her parents as part of the Sixties Scoop—a government policy, started in 1951, by which Indigenous children were taken from their families, communities, and cultures for placement with families that were not of First Nations heritage.

Early in her career, various newspapers referred to her as Algonquin, full-blooded Algonquin, Mi&#x27;kmaq, and half-Mi&#x27;kmaq. The first reference to Sainte-Marie being Cree that CBC News could locate during its investigation of her identity came in December 1963, when the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; called her a &quot;Cree Indian&quot;. Sainte-Marie reiterated that she has community ties with the Piapot First Nation and that she was adopted as an adult by Chief Emile Piapot and Clara Starblanket. Emile&#x27;s great-granddaughter Ntawnis Piapot has corroborated this, saying Sainte-Marie was adopted according to traditional Cree customs over &quot;days and months and years&quot;.

Some members of the Sainte-Marie family had attempted to clarify her European ancestry in the 1960s and 1970s, but the singer threatened them with legal action for doing so. In December 1964, Arthur Santamaria, Sainte-Marie&#x27;s paternal uncle, wrote to the &quot;Wakefield Daily Item&quot;, which published his editorial that Sainte-Marie &quot;has no Indian blood in her&quot; and &quot;not a bit&quot; of Cree heritage. Her brother, Alan Sainte-Marie, also wrote to newspapers, including the &quot;Denver Post&quot; in 1972, to clarify that his sister was not born on a reservation, has Caucasian parents, and that &quot;to associate her with the Indian and to accept her as his spokesman is wrong&quot;. Alan Sainte-Marie&#x27;s daughter Heidi has stated that, in 1975, her father had met Buffy and a PBS producer for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; while working as a commercial pilot. She has said that the producer later asked her father if he was Indigenous because he did not look like he was. Her father clarified that they were of European ancestry and not Indigenous. On November 7, 1975, Alan Sainte-Marie received a letter from a law firm representing Buffy Sainte-Marie, which said, &quot;We have been advised that you have without provocation disparaged and perhaps defamed Buffy and maliciously interfered with her employment opportunities.&quot; The letter also stated that no expense would be spared in pursuing legal remedies. Included with the law firm letter was a handwritten note from Buffy Sainte-Marie to her brother stating that she would expose him for allegedly sexually abusing her as a child if he continued speaking about her ancestry. He decided to back off from his letter-writing campaign and a month later on December 9, 1975, Buffy made her first appearance on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

On October 27, 2023, an investigation by the CBC&#x27;s &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; television program contradicted Sainte-Marie&#x27;s career-long claims of Indigenous ancestry. It included interviews with some of her relatives and located her birth certificate which listed her as white and her supposed adopted parents as her birth parents. In contrast, Sainte-Marie&#x27;s 2018 authorized biography states she was &quot;probably born&quot; on the Piapot First Nation reserve in Saskatchewan, and throughout her adult life she claimed she was adopted and does not know where she was born or who her biological parents are. There is no known official record of her adoption.

On the day before the broadcast of &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;, the Descendants of Piapot and Starblanket issued a statement defending Sainte-Marie&#x27;s ties to the Piapot First Nation, saying: &quot;We claim her as a member of our family and all of our family members are from the Piapot First Nation. To us, that holds far more weight than any paper documentation or colonial record keeping ever could.&quot; They also criticized the allegations against Sainte-Marie as being &quot;hurtful, ignorant, colonial — and racist&quot;.

As part of their reporting, CBC also published Sainte-Marie&#x27;s official birth certificate. It indicates that she was born in Stoneham, Massachusetts, to her white parents, Albert and Winifred Santamaria. Her son Cody says she obtained Native identity through &quot;naturalization&quot; and not by birth. To verify Sainte-Marie&#x27;s early Mi&#x27;kmaq identity claims, her younger sister took a DNA test which showed that she had &quot;almost no&quot; Native American ancestry and she says she is genetically related to Sainte-Marie&#x27;s son, which would not be possible if Sainte-Marie was adopted as she claimed.

Responding to the CBC News findings, the acting chief of the Piapot First Nation, Ira Lavallee, noted that despite her false claims of Indigenous ancestry, Sainte-Marie remained accepted, saying: &quot;We do have one of our families in our community that did adopt her. Regardless of her ancestry, that adoption in our culture to us is legitimate.&quot; 
In late November 2023, Sainte-Marie deleted all claims of being Cree and born on Piapot First Nation in Saskatchewan from her official website. Lavallee said that Sainte-Marie should take a DNA test to clear up the confusion: &quot;That&#x27;s something that anyone in my community can do and would not have fear of doing because we know who we are and what we are, and it&#x27;s easily provable through a DNA test. If Buffy did that, that&#x27;s one thing that could clear all this up.&quot; Cree author Darrel J. McLeod said that Sainte-Marie is an honorary member of the Piapot family, but that growing up with a white family allowed her to develop her talent and audience from a young age and that she should &quot;apologize, come clean, stop gaslighting us and find a way to make amends&quot;.

In late November 2023, following the award of an International Emmy to a documentary film about her life (&quot;Buffy Sainte-Marie: Carry It On&quot;), Sainte-Marie stated, &quot;My mother told me that I was adopted and that I was Native, but there was no documentation as was common for Indigenous children at the time&quot; adding that &quot;I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;m from or who my birth parents are, and I will never know.&quot; She also stated, &quot;I have never known if my birth certificate was real.&quot;

==Honors and awards==
===Honorary degrees===
Saint-Marie has been awarded 15 honorary doctorates. With regard to the University of Massachusetts, her website states that she was awarded an &quot;Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts&quot; in 1983. However, in an interview published in 2009, she stated that &quot;I also got a teaching degree from the University of Massachusetts and later, a PhD in fine arts&quot;.

===Award-related reactions following ancestry controversy===
In 2023, Buffy Sainte-Marie&#x27;s false claims to an Indigenous identity were revealed by &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;. Since then, there have been calls to rescind awards given to Sainte-Marie that were meant for Indigenous people. Indigenous musicians who lost to Sainte-Marie have expressed their disappointment. Issiqut Anguk, sister of singer Kelly Fraser who lost the 2018 Juno Award for Indigenous Music Album of the Year to her, wrote that Fraser &quot;respected Buffy so much and it hurts to hear that maybe, just maybe it would&#x27;ve changed Kelly&#x27;s life if she won the Juno award and Buffy didn&#x27;t.&quot; The Indigenous Women&#x27;s Collective expressed dismay at Sainte-Marie&#x27;s winning a 2023 International Emmy Award for her documentary &quot;Buffy Sainte-Marie: Carry It On&quot; and have asked the Juno Awards to revisit the 2018 category to &quot;explore ways of righting a past wrong. All Indigenous artists in this 2018 category should be reconsidered for this rightful honour.&quot; Tim Johnson, the former associate director of the National Museum of the American Indian says her Juno awards should be rescinded and the Indigenous musicians who lost against Sainte-Marie should be considered her victims. Rhonda Head, an award-winning opera singer from the Opaskwayak Cree Nation says, &quot;She won awards that were an accolade, that were meant for Indigenous musicians and that&#x27;s what really hurts me the most. I would like to see that her awards be taken away forever, for her not being truthful and taking up space.&quot;

On November 8, 2023, the University of British Columbia First Nations House of Learning issued a statement explaining that, in light of the ancestry issues of Buffy Sainte-Marie, they were deciding on the next steps regarding the honorary degree UBC had awarded Sainte-Marie in 2012. The university removed that statement from their website at some point after April 2024 with no further explanation on the status of the honorary degree.

On February 7, 2025, the Government of Canada published a document stating that Sainte-Marie had been removed from the Order of Canada by Governor General Mary Simon on January 3, 2025. Appointments and terminations to the Order of Canada are both made on the basis of an advisory council.

==Personal life==
In 1964, while on a trip to the Piapot Cree reserve in Canada for a powwow, she was adopted by the youngest son of Chief Piapot, Emile Piapot, and his wife, Clara Starblanket Piapot in accordance with Cree Nation tradition.

In 1968, Sainte-Marie married a Hawaiian surfing instructor, Dewain Bugbee; the couple divorced in 1971. She then married Sheldon Wolfchild, from Minnesota, in 1975; they have one son together. They later divorced. She then married Jack Nitzsche, her co-writer on &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot;, on March 19, 1982; they were married for seven years.

Although not a practitioner, Sainte-Marie became an active friend of the Bahá&#x27;í faith, appearing at concerts for and conferences and conventions surrounding the religion. In 1992, she appeared in the musical event prelude to the Baháʼí World Congress, a double concert, &quot;Live Unity: The Sound of the World&quot; (1992) with video broadcast and documentary. In the video documentary of the event Sainte-Marie is seen on the &quot;Dini Petty Show&quot; explaining the Bahá&#x27;í teaching of progressive revelation. She also appears in the 1985 video &quot;Mona With The Children&quot; by Douglas John Cameron. However, while she supports a universal sense of religion, she does not subscribe to any particular religion. &quot;I gave a lot of support to Bahá&#x27;í people in the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s … Bahá&#x27;í people, as people of all religions, is something I&#x27;m attracted to … I don&#x27;t belong to any religion. … I have a huge religious faith or spiritual faith but I feel as though religion … is the first thing that racketeers exploit. … But that doesn&#x27;t turn me against religion …

Sainte-Marie applied for Canadian citizenship through her Cree lawyer, Delia Opekokew, in 1980. In 2017, she stated that she does not have a Canadian passport and is a US citizen.

<text>Manor Park is a residential area of the London Borough of Newham in east London, England. The area is bordered by Ilford to the east, Forest Gate to the west, Wanstead to the north, and East Ham to the south.

It was originally a part of the hundred of Becontree, and part of the historic county of Essex. Since 1965, Manor Park has been part of the London Borough of Newham, a local government district of Greater London. The area forms the majority of the London E12 postcode district.

== History ==
The area known as Manor Park is not formally defined, but is more or less coterminous with the Ancient Parish of Little Ilford. Romford Road, the Roman Road from Aldgate to Colchester, is the main east–west route through the area. This well-established coaching route linking the city with the towns of Essex was maintained by the Middlesex and Essex turnpike trust from 1721. The principal local road ran south from the Romford Road and the northern end was known in the 18th century and later as White Post Lane (now known as High Street North), from a post standing at its junction with Romford Road. The &#x27;White Post&#x27; appears to have stood on the site of the Earl of Essex public house. A hamlet known as North End was located amongst fields that dominated this area.

By the middle of the next century, the rural scene had begun to change as the railways started to spread outwards from London, followed by the development of estates of suburban houses. There were three railway stations close by: which first opened in 1840, which opened in 1873 and which opened in 1894. Tramways operated along the Romford Road.

The beginnings of development along the south of Romford Road took place in 1867, especially close to the junction of High Street North and the site of the future Earl of Essex public house. Behind terraces of workers&#x27; houses was an animal charcoal works, an unpleasant and noxious manufacturing process involving the carcasses of dead horses. Animal charcoal was used as a filter, particularly in the sugar industry. As the area became more built up such trades disappeared and the charcoal works had gone by the 1890s, replaced by a Board School (Salisbury junior mixed and infants) which opened in 1893.

Apart from four pairs of small semi-detached agricultural workers&#x27; houses, known as &quot;Ebor Cottages&quot;, the area to the north of Romford Road was ripe for development; the owners, the Gurney family, sold 110 acres of market garden land to Thomas Corbett in 1877. The Corbett family built the Woodgrange and Durham Road estates between 1877 and 1892. The &quot;Forest Gate Weekly&quot; recorded the attractiveness of the estate, it having &quot;the three great essentials to the average city man of easy access, reasonable rentals and a first class local market.&quot;

By the 1890s, Forest Gate was an upmarket suburb for the aspiring middle class commuter, who could use the Eastern Counties Railway from Manor Park to travel to the city. The area around the junction of Manor Park and White Post Lane (later High Street North) became an important shopping and provisioning area for nearby residents who populated the new streets in the area. In 1898, 1,129 houses accommodated about 6,000 inhabitants were built in Little Ilford on the site of the old Manor Farm.

==Geography==
Manor Park was part of the County Borough of East Ham, Essex until 1965, when the Greater London county was formed. The area postcode is and it is part of the East London post town.

===Durham Road Conservation Zone===
The Durham Road Conservation Zone is a small late-Victorian development, built close to Manor Park station. It was designated a Conservation Area in 1984 to retain its original charm and character. Additional planning controls were introduced in 1998 to protect and enhance its special character. The area, popularly referred to as &quot;Manor Park Village&quot;, was originally developed in the 1880s on farmland that formed part of the Gurney estate. It was built by one builder to an overall plan, with a limited range of house styles giving the area a distinctive character and unity. The developers, the Corbett family, built several suburban estates including the adjacent Woodgrange Estate in Forest Gate.

==Transport==
Romford Road, a stretch of the A118, runs for much of its length in both Newham and Redbridge, providing the main road route through Manor Park and linking the eastern districts with the city of London.

Manor Park railway station is a stop on the main public transport link, the Elizabeth line. Trains between , , and run every ten minutes. Nearby Woodgrange Park station is on the Barking to Gospel Oak line, popularly referred to as the &quot;Goblin&quot;, which is part of the London Overground network. Both stations are in Zone 3.

==Education==

Manor Park is home to many primary schools, including Salisbury primary school, which opened in 1893; it is accessible by the main Romford Road or High Street North.

==Sport==
Manor Park also has an amateur football team called &quot;A.C. Manor Park&quot;, who play in the AFL.

<doc id="418639" wikidata="Q1603376" url="?curid=418639" title="New Democrat Coalition">
<text>The New Democrat Coalition is a caucus in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress made up of Democrats, primarily liberals and centrists, who take a pro-business stance and a liberal-to-moderate approach to fiscal matters. Most members hold socially liberal views.

The caucus has been described as being center to center-left.

When the 119th Congress convened on January 3, 2025, the New Democrat Coalition touted 110 members (including one nonvoting member), accounting for more than half of all Democratic representatives and making it the largest House Democrat ideological caucus, followed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

== Overview ==
The New Democrat Coalition is a caucus within the House of Representatives founded in 1997 by Representatives Cal Dooley, Jim Moran, and Tim Roemer.

The Coalition supported &quot;Third Way&quot; policies during the presidency of Bill Clinton. The Coalition consists of liberal, moderate, and centrist Democrats. After the sharp decline of the Blue Dog Coalition in the 2010s, the New Democrat Coalition gained some of the Blue Dog Coalition&#x27;s former clout by also having members from swing seats.

The group is known as fiscally moderate and pro-business. For example, the New Democrat Coalition supports free trade and the high-tech sector. The New Democrat Coalition also supports immigration reform.

Ideologically, it is positioned between the House Progressive Caucus and the Blue Dog Coalition. The Coalition has been described as both socially liberal and fiscally moderate-to-conservative.

== Policy positions ==
The NDC advocates &quot;working to bridge the partisan divide with a solutions-oriented approach to politics&quot;, combating climate change, transitioning to sustainable energy, increased access towards healthcare, and strengthening U.S. national security.

=== Economy ===
According to their Economic Opportunity Agenda, they value the diversification and strengthening of global supply chains, the enaction of legislation to address current constraints to global trade, the reduction of costs for U.S. consumers, and to buttress the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. They believe in a transparent exclusion process from Section 301 tariffs, and pursuing free trade agreements with the United Kingdom, Kenya, and Taiwan. The NDC lays out their plan to the reduction of energy prices and the transition to sustainable energy by instituting the investments made in the Inflation Reduction Act and easing market barriers towards cleaner energy.

=== Healthcare ===
On April 3, 2019, Representative Ami Bera introduced HR 2061, proposing state market mechanisms to increase enrollment, particularly focusing on auto-enrollment for those qualifying for $0 premium health plans.

==== Abortion rights ====
The New Democrat Coalition supports the right to travel for abortion, the protection of doctors who conduct abortions, and the enshrining of protections for reproductive care for servicewomen and military families. They also support the codification of abortion rights as protected by Roe v. Wade.

=== National security ===
According to their National Security Principles they value the modernization and sustainment of the U.S. Military, reinforcement of American internationalism, strengthening of regional commitments, reinforcing U.S. cybersecurity, and addressing the deficit.

==== Cybersecurity ====
When it comes to cybersecurity, the New Democrat Coalition&#x27;s cybersecurity task force confronts digital security with fostering public-private information sharing, developing stronger defenses against cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism, establishment of a strong pipeline of workers to address said cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism, investment into stronger defenses in the public and private sectors, and securing the Internet of Things.

=== Climate change ===
According to the NDC&#x27;s Principles for U.S. Climate Policy, they propose American global coordination towards climate solutions, transition to a clean energy economy, enacting climate-forward policies towards disaster relief and the transition of local communities to a sustainable energy grid, and recommitting to the Paris Agreement. 

=== Foreign policy ===

==== Israel ====

On October 12, 2023, five days after the October 7 attack on Israel, the NDC endorsed a bipartisan resolution on standing with Israel and unequivocally condemning Hamas. Later, on October 20, they endorsed Biden&#x27;s request for supplemental funding for both Israel and Ukraine. 

==== Russian invasion of Ukraine ====
On April 20, 2024, the NDC affirmed their commitment to Ukraine by endorsing the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2024. They would later applaud the success of the bill on April 23.

<text>KARE (channel 11) is a television station licensed to Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, serving as the NBC affiliate for the Twin Cities area. Owned by Tegna Inc., the station maintains studios on Olson Memorial Highway (MN 55) in Golden Valley and a transmitter at the Telefarm site in Shoreview, Minnesota.

Channel 11 began broadcasting on September 1, 1953. It was originally shared by WMIN-TV in St. Paul and WTCN-TV in Minneapolis; the two stations shared an affiliation with ABC and alternated presenting local programs. In 1955, Consolidated Television and Radio bought both stations and merged them as WTCN-TV from the Minneapolis studios in the Calhoun Beach Hotel. The station presented several regionally and nationally notable children&#x27;s shows in its early years as well as local cooking, news, and sports programs. Time Inc. purchased the station in 1957. Under its ownership, ABC switched its affiliation to KMSP-TV (channel 9), leaving channel 11 to become an independent station that broadcast games of the Minnesota Twins baseball team, movies, and syndicated programs. This continued under two successive owners: Chris-Craft Industries and Metromedia. By the late 1970s, WTCN was one of the nation&#x27;s most financially successful independent stations.

In 1978, NBC&#x27;s Twin Cities affiliate, KSTP-TV, announced it would switch its affiliation to ABC. This forced NBC to select between KMSP and WTCN for its new local outlet. It chose WTCN on the strength of its facilities, ownership, and promise to build a first-class news operation, for which KMSP had never been known as an ABC station. On March 5, 1979, channel 11 became an NBC affiliate and began broadcasting &quot;NewsCenter 11&quot; newscasts. In spite of a major promotional campaign, the news product was a high-profile commercial failure, beaten by entertainment shows on KMSP in the ratings, as viewers rejected the new news team and continued to prefer market leaders WCCO-TV and KSTP-TV.

Metromedia agreed to buy Chicago independent station WFLD in 1982 and sold WTCN to Gannett to raise capital and make room in its station group. Gannett engineered a comprehensive overhaul of the station&#x27;s news programming. Between 1983 and 1987, the station moved from last to first in late news ratings, battling WCCO for two decades. It changed call signs twice in that period, to WUSA in 1985 and KARE in 1986, when Gannett moved the WUSA call sign to its Washington, D.C., station. More recently, as of 2022, the station has been a second-place finisher in local news.

==History==
===Early years===
====WMIN-TV and WTCN-TV: The shared-time era====
The WMIN Broadcasting Company of St. Paul applied in February 1948 for a new station licensed to that city on channel 2. The application was frozen when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) halted all grants of new TV stations in 1948.

In February 1952—two months before the FCC lifted the freeze—the Minnesota Television Public Service Corporation, a company headed by former ambassador Robert Butler and headquartered in St. Paul, filed for television channel 11 in Minneapolis. Weeks later, Mid Continent Radio Television, which owned station WTCN-TV on channel 4 as well as WTCN (1280 AM), announced it would take over WCCO radio, combine its operations with channel 4, and divest WTCN radio. Minnesota Television Public Service then acquired WTCN radio, which had to be sold to allow Mid Continent to purchase WCCO. The transactions were approved in August 1952, at which time channel 4 changed from WTCN-TV to WCCO-TV.

After the freeze was lifted, WMIN refiled its pre-freeze application in July to specify channel 11, as channel 2 had been set aside for educational broadcasting by the FCC. Later that month, Meredith Publishing filed for channel 11 in Minneapolis alongside stations in Rochester, New York, and St. Louis. Meredith owned three stations and had three pending station applications when the FCC ruled that companies could only have as many applications as additional stations it could own—the limit being five—in February 1953. With six stations and applications for stations, the company was one over the limit; it then dropped out of the channel 11 fight. WMIN and WTCN—each seeking to avoid a lengthy comparative hearing—proposed to share time on channel 11, which the FCC accepted in April 1953.
On September 1, 1953, channel 11 began broadcasting. At 2 p.m., the first WMIN-TV programs aired: a news show, the women&#x27;s program &quot;Talk About the Town&quot;, and a movie. Two hours later, WTCN-TV greeted viewers with a dedication, the cooking show &quot;Man Around the House&quot;, and a teen music bandstand program, &quot;Corner Drug&quot;. Channel 11&#x27;s signal originated from the Foshay Tower in downtown Minneapolis; the tower had a master antenna inspired by the Empire State Building in New York and designed to broadcast multiple stations, including the antenna for WCCO-TV and provision for antennas for channels 9 and 11 before any applicant had a construction permit for them.
The transmitter and antenna were the only physical facilities shared by the stations. While WMIN-TV and WTCN-TV were affiliates of ABC, in keeping with WTCN radio, their programs and even network shows during each station&#x27;s airtime originated from separate facilities. WMIN-TV set up in the former WMIN radio studios in the Hamm Building in St. Paul, the radio station having relocated to its transmitter site; it had no film developing equipment, so films had to be airmailed to and from sister station KELO-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. WTCN-TV established itself in the Calhoun Beach Hotel in Minneapolis. The hotel offered the station the use of its ballroom; its former gymnasium, left unfinished when the former beach club converted to a hotel, became the largest TV studio to that time in the Twin Cities.

Each station offered its own local programs. WMIN had the children&#x27;s show &quot;Captain 11&quot;, featuring host Jim Lange in a space-themed outfit. It also featured Wrangler Steve, a host of Westerns played by WMIN radio disc jockey Steve Cannon. For kids, WTCN had the clown J. P. Patches, originally played by Daryl Laub and then by Chris Wedes. Wedes left for the new KIRO-TV in Seattle in 1958; &quot;Patches&quot; aired on the Seattle station until 1981. For 19 years, Roger Awsumb played Casey Jones on WTCN&#x27;s &quot;Lunch with Casey&quot;.

By 1954, channel 11 was offering some programming from the DuMont Television Network, though the network&#x27;s shows moved to new station KEYD-TV (channel 9) when it launched in January 1955.

====Consolidated consolidation and purchase by Time, Inc.====
In January 1955, Consolidated Television and Radio Broadcasters of Indianapolis, a company owned by the Bitner family, agreed to acquire WTCN radio and television and WMIN-TV for about $3 million. Bitner believed that the channel 11 stations made for an attractive purchase because their values were artificially lowered by confusion stemming from the shared-station setup. It announced that it would keep the WTCN call letters. When Consolidated completed the purchase in April, WMIN left the air and merged into the full-time WTCN. At that time, the new owner consolidated the station&#x27;s activities at WTCN&#x27;s Minneapolis studios and closed WMIN&#x27;s St. Paul facilities, with only a handful of WMIN technical employees not continuing with channel 11. During this time, the station affiliated with the NTA Film Network, which began in 1956.

The Bitner group had owned the WTCN stations for less than two years when it announced the sale of three of its broadcasting properties—the WTCN stations, WFBM radio and television in Indianapolis, and WLAV radio and television in Grand Rapids, Michigan—to Time, Inc. in December 1956. The $15.75 million deal came after the Crowell-Collier Publishing Company backed out of a transaction for the stations plus WFDF in Flint, Michigan. FCC approval followed in April 1957. Time improved station revenues by expanding its movie library and sharpening its promotion of feature films. It offered a large schedule of local sports, including select games of Minneapolis Millers minor league baseball, which WTCN radio broadcast all season long; the station cut back its sports broadcasts on radio and TV due to difficulty selling advertising time and intense competition, particularly for the radio broadcasts of Minnesota Golden Gophers football.

===As an independent station===

====Loss of ABC affiliation====
By the start of the 1960s, Time&#x27;s relationship with ABC had become strained. &quot;Variety&quot; reported in March 1960 that station management was insisting on a protection clause, a guarantee that ABC would not go to KMSP-TV (channel 9), an independent station then owned by 20th Century Fox. KMSP was already carrying some ABC shows that were not seen on channel 11&#x27;s schedule. Channel 11&#x27;s fears were well-founded; in January 1961, ABC announced it would move its programs to KMSP effective April 16.

The newly independent channel 11 became the market&#x27;s first station to telecast major league baseball with the newly relocated Minnesota Twins; WCCO-TV had agreed to broadcast the games, but CBS refused to allow the station to preempt prime-time network programs for baseball, forcing channel 4 to back out. The station agreed to telecast 50 night and weekend games, simulcast with WCCO radio, with Bob Wolff and Ray Scott as announcers. The Twins, movies, and feature programs became the station&#x27;s top program draws, as well as newscasts timed to air just before the network affiliates, including hourly news breaks and a 9 p.m. newscast. To support its new local programming, the station expanded its footprint in the Calhoun Beach Hotel to include space on the lower level and acquired new equipment. Despite this, Time noted in its annual report that losing ABC was &quot;forcing a re-adjustment to the economies of independent television station operations&quot; at channel 11.

The Twins proved key to channel 11&#x27;s survival without a network affiliation. Telecasts reached audience shares averaging 58 percent and as high as 79 percent in 1962. A major advertising contract with Hamm&#x27;s beer for the baseball games helped the station acquire programming and get on steadier footing—its first profitable footing in its ten-year history. An American Research Bureau report found that the station had the largest relative audience share of any independent in the country, even in months without baseball. Twins games earned channel 11 placement on cable systems far from the Twin Cities, including Mankato and Rochester, Minnesota, and Eau Claire and La Crosse, Wisconsin. Building on the success of the Twins telecasts, the station sought to broaden its image as a sports outlet by adding wrestling (broadcast from the studio) and college sports to its lineup.

====Chris-Craft ownership====
In the three years Time owned WTCN-TV as an independent, it negotiated with several groups to sell the television station and WTCN radio. In July 1961, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Chicago-based WGN Inc. was considering buying WTCN-TV from Time; other buyers looked at and passed on the station at this time. A Twin Cities–based consortium agreed to pay $2 million for the WTCN stations in 1963 but failed to come up with the money. Chris-Craft Industries agreed to purchase WTCN-TV alone for $4 million in a deal announced in May 1964; it was the company&#x27;s third TV property after two other independents, KCOP in Los Angeles and KPTV in Portland, Oregon. WTCN radio was sold separately to the Buckley-Jaeger Company and became WWTC that October.

Chris-Craft fortified the station&#x27;s children&#x27;s and movie offerings to complement its strong sports coverage. The children&#x27;s relaunch included a kids club and hours a day of weekday shows promoted as &quot;Kidville 11&quot;. The company stated in its 1965 annual report that WTCN-TV&#x27;s performance &quot;exceeded expectations&quot;. By 1966, the Twins games were being fed by WTCN-TV to a network of 15 television stations, which grew to 16 with the inclusion of WVTV in Milwaukee the next year; the Twins were joined on channel 11 in 1967 by the new Minnesota North Stars hockey team.

In June 1971, WTCN-TV joined other local stations in moving its tower to the Telefarm site in Shoreview, Minnesota. The relocation to the newer, taller masts was necessitated because of the construction of the IDS Center, a Minneapolis skyscraper that shaded many viewers from the Foshay Tower site. The new tower, which was shared by the former Foshay stations—WCCO-TV, KSTP-TV, and WTCN-TV—collapsed on September 7 during further construction work, killing seven workers. In lieu of the collapsed candelabra, Telefarm proposed constructing one tower for WTCN-TV and an FM station and another for WCCO and KSTP. The replacements were erected in late 1972.

====Metromedia ownership====

Chris-Craft announced the sale of WTCN-TV to Metromedia for $18 million on July 29, 1971. Chris-Craft sold the station as part of its pursuit of a large-market VHF television station elsewhere. After taking over, Metromedia made major changes in the station&#x27;s programming. Citing declining ratings and a company policy against live children&#x27;s hosts, &quot;Lunch with Casey&quot; finished its run at the end of 1972. Channel 11 dropped the Twins, also due to falling viewership, with the team moving telecasts to WCCO-TV; the team returned to channel 11 in 1975. Under Metromedia, WTCN-TV became one of the nation&#x27;s most financially lucrative independent stations, even though it was less profitable than the network affiliates.

Metromedia&#x27;s purchase of WTCN-TV included a parcel of land at the corner of Boone Avenue and Minnesota State Highway 55 in Golden Valley, intended for the construction of new studios. Metromedia broke ground on a $5 million, studio complex on the site in May 1973; it featured two broadcast studios, an outdoor sculpture garden, and space for Metromedia&#x27;s corporate art collection.

While the network affiliates intensified their competition for the news audience, WTCN&#x27;s small news effort—a 9:30 p.m. newscast known as &quot;Total News&quot;—was not considered much of a factor in the market, although it was just behind KMSP-TV in total viewers. Until moving to Golden Valley, all the station&#x27;s news film was developed by a company in downtown Minneapolis that closed at dinnertime, preventing the broadcast of late-breaking news items. Gil Amundson doubled as the news director and anchor. WTCN had the only TV news team in the market without a professional meteorologist. &quot;TV Guide&quot; ran a feature calling WTCN the real-life equivalent to WJM-TV, the Minneapolis station depicted on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;.

===Affiliating with NBC===
KMSP-TV, the Twin Cities&#x27; ABC affiliate, was a distant third in the news ratings race. Channel 9 was traditionally the most profitable station in the market, but under Donald Swartz, it was a lean operation with a reputation for penny-pinching. As early as 1974, KMSP was rumored to have made changes to its news operation to appease the network, which threatened to re-affiliate with WTCN, and further rumors of network dissatisfaction with KMSP&#x27;s news effort surfaced in 1977. Channel 9&#x27;s news budget was reportedly less than half that of WCCO-TV or KSTP-TV. In the late 1970s, as ABC soared to number one in the national ratings, the network began a campaign to upgrade its affiliate base and approached WCCO-TV, KSTP-TV, and WTCN-TV. KSTP-TV, the NBC affiliate and the market&#x27;s news ratings leader, wished to expand its signal beyond the Twin Cities to take advantage of recently relaxed rules relating to the feeding of broadcast translators by microwave transmission, and there were fewer ABC affiliates in surrounding areas—notably Alexandria and Eau Claire—than NBC affiliates. On August 29, 1978, KSTP announced it would switch from NBC to ABC in March 1979, ending a 50-year relationship between KSTP and NBC dating to the days of radio. The size of the market and tenure of KSTP with NBC made the switch particularly stunning; KSTP&#x27;s defection was seen as a coup, the largest engineered by the network.

Even before KSTP&#x27;s affiliation switch was publicly announced, NBC reached out to Metromedia as it began to evaluate KMSP-TV and WTCN-TV for potential affiliation with the network. As part of the process, it reached out to former employees of KMSP-TV, at least one of whom told NBC that its management &quot;didn&#x27;t care about news&quot; and that it was &quot;a stepchild of their operation&quot;. At the end of September, NBC announced its decision: it would affiliate with WTCN-TV. The network picked channel 11 over channel 9 on the strength of its facilities and performance.

In reaching a deal, Metromedia promised NBC that it would launch a &quot;first-class news operation&quot; for the station, which was weak in the area of news (though better than many independents) and had a news staff totaling 10 people at the time. Most of the $4 million Metromedia spent ahead of the affiliation switch was invested in the news department, on new reporters, largely coming from TV stations in the South; a new news set; weather radar; and electronic news gathering, replacing film. The only member of the news department who did not continue after the switch was weather anchor Toni Hughes, who had presented channel 11&#x27;s weathercasts for a decade; she was dismissed because she was not a meteorologist. Though she was technically a freelancer, her duties for WTCN prevented her from simultaneously working for another station.

WTCN-TV became the Twin Cities&#x27; NBC affiliate on March 5, 1979. Ahead of the switch, the station launched a $1 million promotional campaign titled &quot;We&#x27;ve Got It Now&quot;, featuring billboards of such NBC stars as Johnny Carson, a visit by network president Fred Silverman and other NBC stars, and the live broadcast of &quot;Today&quot; from Minneapolis. That same day, &quot;NewsCenter 11&quot; launched with weeknight news anchor Jim Dyer, meteorologist Glenn Burns, and sportscaster Bob Kurtz.

====&quot;NewsCenter 11&quot;: Lackluster performance====
&quot;NewsCenter 11&quot; was a ratings and critical disaster. Neal Gendler in the &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot; was unimpressed and found the program pedestrian, formulaic, overdone, and out of tune with Twin Cities viewers&#x27; tastes. He criticized Kurtz for laughing at skiers in bikinis, writing, &quot;Someone also ought to let him in on a fact of Minnesota life: Sexism is out of style.&quot; John Carman of &quot;The Minneapolis Star&quot; called it &quot;a near-perfect case history of how not to put together a successful and respected news operation&quot;, calling its format too conventional and Gil Amundson (later relieved of news director duties) too weak a leader. Carman and Karl Vick (also of &quot;The Minneapolis Star&quot;) assigned some blame for the failure to the direction of the station by out-of-town consultants—particularly Ted Kavanau, the former news director of Metromedia&#x27;s WNEW-TV in New York—and executives unfamiliar with the market. Kavanau wanted a tabloid-style newscast in the mold of WNEW and hired people for such a program, but general manager Robert Fransen believed a more conventional format was advisable in the market and prevailed in a meeting of Metromedia executives.

In its first ratings survey, the station placed fourth out of three newscasts (and KMSP, airing entertainment shows) at 6 p.m., enough to be described as &quot;about as popular as the measles&quot; by Vick in &quot;The Star&quot;; its performance was so poor that the station, having pledged advertisers a certain level of viewership, had to offer costly makegood ads. During NBC prime time, the station had 21 percent of the audience, half of which left for other stations during the 10 p.m. news, but viewers returned to channel 11 to watch &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. The station attracted 8 to 10 percent of the evening news audience, far behind KSTP and WCCO, which commanded shares of 30 percent or more. The station&#x27;s poor performance also sank the NBC network newscasts, which fell to third place. Meanwhile, freed of its network programming and having picked up the North Stars and Twins rights, KMSP-TV became one of the nation&#x27;s leading independents, beating &quot;NewsCenter 11&quot; in the ratings just as WTCN had done when KMSP was an ABC affiliate. Kevin O&#x27;Brien, WTCN&#x27;s general manager at the time, later told &quot;The Mercury News&quot; that switching to NBC &quot;tore that station asunder because we didn&#x27;t have that much time to plan such a dramatic change&quot;.

While the news product improved under new news director Brink Chipman and as reporters settled into the market, turmoil engulfed the troubled newsroom. An investigative reporter was fired in July before her reports even appeared on air due to poor-quality work. Dyer, unhappy nearly from the start, was switched with weekend anchor Stan Bohrman in August and left in December. At year&#x27;s end, Kurtz was taken off the weeknight newscasts and replaced with Tom Ryther, formerly of KSTP-TV, returning to the Twin Cities from WKYC-TV in Cleveland. Burns was the last of the original three news presenters to leave WTCN; in January 1982, he accepted a position with WSB-TV in Atlanta, where he would spend 40 years. Ratings improved modestly when channel 11 shifted its early newscast from 6 to 5:30 p.m., moving it out of direct competition with WCCO and KSTP, though it still trailed the national newscasts they offered at that time. This did not stanch turmoil in the newsroom, nor did it forestall Metromedia from shuttering the profitable Metro Productions commercial production unit of WTCN in December 1980. One bright spot for the station was a 1982 series on herpes reported by anchor John Bachman, &quot;Herpes Is Forever&quot;, which won an Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award.

To increase revenue, which lagged behind other major-market network affiliates, Metromedia ceased airing the network&#x27;s &quot;The Tomorrow Show&quot; in favor of sitcoms from which it earned all the advertising, doing the same with the occasional network movie. In early 1982, the station temporarily lost the ability to air the &quot;Tonight Show&quot;; NBC strictly enforced the show airing at 10:30 p.m. and would take the show to another station in the market if it was aired on tape delay, which WTCN did to air syndicated repeats of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. WTCN defended its decision by citing Carson&#x27;s older demographics at a time when his ratings were slipping nationally. When KMSP refused to air &quot;Tonight&quot; for the same reason, NBC was forced to acquiesce to WTCN&#x27;s delay. Asked in 1981 by the &quot;Boston Herald American&quot; to appraise Metromedia&#x27;s management of WTCN, M. Howard Gelfand of the &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot; noted that &quot;it has taken WTCN-TV ... just a couple of years to turn a silk purse into a sow&#x27;s ear&quot;.

===Gannett purchase and news overhaul===
In August 1982, Metromedia agreed to buy WFLD, an independent station in Chicago. It needed to sell one TV station and a Chicago radio station to stay within ownership limits, but it chose to divest itself of a second TV station to raise the money necessary for the $136 million purchase—the second-highest for a single station—without incurring debt. First to be sold was WXIX-TV, an independent station in Cincinnati, followed by WTCN-TV, acquired by the Gannett Company for $75 million. Gannett, in turn, needed to sell one VHF television station to make room in its portfolio and chose KARK-TV in Little Rock, Arkansas, for divestiture.
Gannett took control of WTCN in April 1983 and began implementing a top-to-bottom overhaul of the station&#x27;s local news programming, promising to raise its quality to match WCCO and KSTP. A new station manager and vice president of news were brought in, both from KBTV, Gannett&#x27;s market-leading station in Denver, to replace the existing management which remained with Metromedia. Nearly immediately, the new management moved to distance the news product from its image under Metromedia, changing the name from &quot;NewsCenter 11&quot; to &quot;11 News&quot;, similar to the &quot;9 News&quot; title used by KBTV. Armed with research identifying WCCO and KSTP as having older-skewing viewership and seeing a void for a newscast for a younger audience, the station added as many as 40 new staff members in addition to the 40 that it had at the time of purchase—compared to 100 apiece for the newsrooms at WCCO-TV and KSTP-TV. To keep pace with its competitors, the station acquired a news helicopter, as well as new cameras and vehicles.

Gannett filled the meteorologist position, left unfilled on a permanent basis since Burns&#x27;s departure in January 1982, by hiring Paul Douglas, who had worked for the Satellite News Channel. The station cut a hole through the wall of its studio to create an outdoor weather set for Douglas&#x27;s forecasts. It replaced the existing anchor pairing of John Bachman and Cora-Ann Mihalik with Paul Magers and Diana Pierce, both hired in August from California stations. The station increased its emphasis on news photography; in addition to hiring anchors, it hired new news photographers.

The revamped newscasts debuted quietly in September 1983. Along with the new anchor team and set improvements, the newscasts were rebranded &quot;News 11&quot;, the second change in title in three months. Ratings did not improve immediately, but they began to rise slowly as early as November 1983. By November 1984, the station had increased its audience share at 10 p.m. to 15 percent, a significant increase from the previous year. The gap with second-place KSTP narrowed as the station increased its audience share to 23 percent by February 1986.

====Two call sign changes in a year====
The FCC liberalized rules around call signs in late 1983. Gannett—the publisher of &quot;USA Today&quot;—acquired the rights to the call sign KUSA in early 1984 and won approval to use the letters on the former KBTV in Denver after years of being stymied under the old rules. While Gannett initially intended to do the same immediately after acquiring WTCN-TV, it instead focused on rebuilding the news operation and beating back a challenge to the KUSA assignment from the USA Network cable service. After Gannett won that fight, it sought and received permission to change WTCN-TV&#x27;s call sign to WUSA effective July 4, 1985. The new designation replaced WTCN-TV—a call sign associated with the station&#x27;s independent days—at a time when the station was finally becoming a local news competitor.

The WUSA call letters lasted less than one year in Minneapolis. Gannett acquired the Evening News Association in February 1986; among its holdings was WDVM, the CBS affiliate in Washington, D.C., near Gannett&#x27;s corporate headquarters in nearby Rosslyn, Virginia. From the moment Gannett took that station over, it mulled moving the WUSA call letters to Washington to provide a solid co-association with &quot;USA Today&quot; as well as Washington being the nation&#x27;s capital. In March, John Carmody of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Gannett had instructed the Minneapolis station to come up with a new call sign. The station reached a deal with a radio station in Atchison, Kansas, that had used the KARE call sign since 1949 to use &quot;KARE&quot; and switched to it on June 11. The new designation was in keeping with the station&#x27;s heavy community service component since its acquisition by Gannett, including an awards event titled &quot;11 Who Care&quot;. This freed its new sister station, channel 9 in Washington, to switch from WDVM to WUSA.

====Ratings rise====

Channel 11&#x27;s rising news fortunes continued after the call sign change to KARE, coinciding with a turnaround in ratings for the NBC network. Weeks after becoming KARE came another pivotal moment. On July 18, 1986, helicopter pilot Max Messmer was in the air headed to an assignment when he heard that a funnel cloud was forming in Brooklyn Park, eventually touching down in Fridley. He piloted the helicopter, known as Sky 11, to the scene and ad-libbed commentary as the aircraft flew within a quarter-mile of the tornado. The tornado coverage aired live on KARE&#x27;s 5 p.m. newscast, providing startling pictures of the storm. It was the first time a tornado had been filmed from creation to dissipation. The newscast was a ratings milestone for the station—in 2011, Douglas recalled that it led many WCCO and KSTP viewers to sample KARE&#x27;s news—and the raw footage was widely requested by scientists and meteorologists.

In 1986, the station took the lead among the coveted demographic of adults 25–54, a demographic with which it placed first in all but one ratings survey between 1986 and 2000. In October 1986, the station notched its first-ever second-place finish in local news ratings, sending KSTP-TV&#x27;s 10 p.m. news to third. But the station lagged badly in early evening news, contending that its younger viewers were still at work and not able to watch 5 or 6 p.m. newscasts. The July 1987 sweeps period brought another historic achievement for KARE: it finished first at 10 p.m., with an audience share of 29 percent. This momentum was sustained through late 1987 and early 1988, even as an expansion to the Twin Cities market gave WCCO an edge in counting viewers in Alexandria. The ratings increase boosted the station&#x27;s bottom line, as the cost of a 30-second commercial during channel 11&#x27;s newscasts rose from $200 in 1983 to as much as $2,300 by 1987.

KARE attracted criticism for its newscasts&#x27; style: trendy and designed to draw an emotional response. The latter was evident in its photojournalism style, which the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; later called &quot;highly visual and emotional&quot;; KARE became a regular winner of National Press Photographers Association awards. This prompted WCCO-TV, a station known for its hard news format, to become more image-conscious, and the other TV news outlets in the Twin Cities began incorporating longer, photojournalism-driven stories into their newscasts. KARE became the first Twin Cities station to offer closed captioning of its local news in 1988. When the Minnesota Poll in 1988 found KARE&#x27;s viewership concentrated among young adults, Noel Holston of the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; predicted that the station could be dominant &quot;for years to come&quot; based on the age of its news watchers.

In September 1988, Pat Miles left her job at WCCO-TV and signed a five-year agreement to work at KARE, including a year where she could not appear on camera under a non-compete clause. The pact brought Miles, who wanted more personal time, together with channel 11, seeking an anchor to improve the lagging ratings of its early evening newscasts. Meanwhile, WCCO found renewed ratings strength and pushed KARE back to second.

Under the leadership of general manager Linda Rios Brook, from 1989 to 1991, the station tried several unsuccessful initiatives, most notably a morning talk show titled &quot;Between Friends&quot; that failed to make an impact in the ratings, but its newscasts regained the local news lead for the first time in several years. Rios Brook resigned after mixed programming results and a controversy over her evangelical Christianity and resurfaced in the market as the president and general manager of family-oriented KLGT. At KARE, she was replaced by Hank Price, who had managed WFMY-TV in Greensboro, North Carolina. In 1992, KARE became one of the television homes of the NBA&#x27;s Minnesota Timberwolves, joining KITN-TV (channel 29, now WFTC) and effectively replacing KSTP-TV with seven to eight games a year of a 25-game broadcast TV package. This was the first time since carrying the Twins as an independent station that channel 11 had broadcast local professional sports. Beginning in 1994, KLGT replaced KITN-TV in the arrangement. By the 2000–01 season, KARE had 15 games and channel 23, by then known as KMWB, had 20. The team moved its broadcast games to WFTC ahead of the 2001–02 season.

In the early 1990s, two of the original team of anchors that made KARE a competitor in the 1980s left. The more acrimonious departure was that of sportscaster Tom Ryther, who was forced out in 1991 after suing the station for age discrimination. Ryther alleged that his job duties had been progressively reduced in order to bring younger faces—such as his replacement, Jeff Passolt—on screen. KARE defended itself by pointing to research from 1990 that it conducted on local TV personalities. Ryther&#x27;s lawsuit was successful; a jury issued a $715,000 judgment in his favor in 1993. KARE appealed, but a federal appeals court upheld the verdict in 1996, and the Supreme Court rejected KARE&#x27;s final appeal in 1997. In 1994, Douglas departed KARE in search of a job closer to family in the eastern U.S. He was replaced by weekend meteorologist Ken Barlow on the weeknight newscasts.

The 1990s were a decade of strength for KARE news. The station continued its domination of viewers 25–54 while narrowly trailing or narrowly leading WCCO-TV in total ratings in late news, though channel 4 had more total viewers for its early evening newscasts. During the decade, KARE added Saturday morning newscasts, in 1992.

KARE aired the locally produced game show &quot;Let&#x27;s Bowl&quot; for several years in the late 1990s; it ran after &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The audience support for the program was sufficient to help its creators, Tim Scott and Rick Kronfeld, secure a pickup for their show from the Comedy Central cable channel.

===Post-2000===
KARE launched a high-definition digital signal on channel 35 on August 31, 2001. KARE and WCCO on the Telefarm tower had intended to launch digital service as early as November 1999, but bad weather and high demand for tower crews stalled the project.

Magers—the anchor commonly credited with helping KARE remain number one in late evening news—left the station in 2003 to work for KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, ending the Magers–Pierce tandem that had become the longest-running anchor duo in the Twin Cities. Without Magers—and what competitor Don Shelby called his &quot;magical formula&quot;—on channel 11, interest heightened in the local stations&#x27; ratings performance. Frank Vascellaro, the man hired to replace Magers on the anchor desk, was the husband of WCCO evening news anchor Amelia Santaniello. Vascellaro&#x27;s departure in 2005 coincided with that of Barlow, who was hired by WBZ-TV in Boston. In the wake of these departures and the replacement of Vascellaro by Mike Pomeranz on the anchor desk, WCCO slowly crept closer to KARE and then took the lead in 2006, with a swing of three percent of the audience share to WCCO. When Pomeranz left to take a position with the San Diego Padres in 2006, sports anchor Randy Shaver moved to the news desk.

The station experimented with several formats for its mid-morning program. In 2006, it replaced &quot;KARE 11 Today&quot; with a new program, &quot;Showcase Minnesota&quot;, that also featured advertiser-paid sponsored segments. It was replaced in 2011 with a revival of &quot;KARE 11 Today&quot;; Pierce left her evening anchor duties to host the revamped show and KARE&#x27;s 4 p.m. newscast.

The loss of ratings momentum continued in the early 2010s, as KARE slumped while WCCO locked up most of the number-one positions by demographic and time slot. A special month of newscasts by WCCO led that station to its first 25–54 win in late news since 1986. While, as of 2022, KARE has been competitive—particularly in the 25–54 demographic—WCCO has generally been the market leader in total viewers. Pierce retired in 2016 after taking a buyout package offered by Tegna, which became the new name for the former Gannett broadcast division when its TV stations and newspapers split into separate companies in 2015.

The KARE newsroom won multiple national journalism awards in the late 2010s and early 2020s. Three different investigative series together won the Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award in 2017, followed by two awards in 2020 for &quot;On the Veteran Beat&quot; and &quot;Love Them First&quot;. An investigation on prisons, &quot;Cruel and Unusual&quot;, won the duPont–Columbia in 2022, The next year, the station won another duPont–Columbia for a series on violent criminals titled &quot;The Gap: Failure to Treat, Failure to Protect&quot;. This series also won a Peabody Award, the second for the station after a joint award to KARE and KUSA in Denver in 2022.

KARE, which relocated its digital signal from its pre-transition UHF channel 35 to VHF channel 11 upon the digital transition in 2009, was approved in 2020 to relocate to UHF channel 31 to aid reception after the spectrum incentive auction. The station switched to the new UHF signal on October 20, 2021.

On December 11, 2024, KARE announced an agreement with the Timberwolves to simulcast five games with FanDuel Sports Network North during the 2024–25 season. The deal also includes the rights to simulcast pre- and post-game coverage. This marked the first time since 2000–01 that the Timberwolves have aired locally on KARE.

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Translators===
In addition to the main transmitter in Shoreview, KARE&#x27;s signal is relayed to outlying parts of Minnesota through a network of translators owned by various translator associations.

* Alexandria: K14LZ-D
* Frost: K31EF-D (11.1 as 11.4)
* Jackson: K19HZ-D (11.1 as 11.4)
* Olivia: K20JY-D

KARE formerly had a translator serving Breezy Point and Brainerd, KLKS-LP (channel 14), which was owned by the Lakes Broadcasting Group, owner of KLKS radio. The repeater signed on in 1995 and operated until July 16, 2011, when its use as a repeater of KARE was discontinued due to a corporate decision made by Gannett management.

<doc id="418646" wikidata="Q974595" url="?curid=418646" title="H-1B visa">
<text>The H-1B is a foreign worker visa in the United States that allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in so-called specialty occupations. The regulation and implementation of the visa program is carried out by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) within the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Although U.S. law does not specify what it considers &quot;specialty occupations,&quot; they are defined as a category of specialized knowledge and eligible applicants must have at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher qualification, or the equivalent work experience.

The visa allows an initial three-year stay in the U.S., which may be extended to a maximum of six years. After this period, the visa holder must either leave the U.S. or reapply. The number of H-1B visas issued each fiscal year is capped at 65,000, with an additional 20,000 visas available for individuals who have earned a master&#x27;s degree or higher from a U.S. institution. Sponsorship by an employer is required for applicants.

In 2019, the USCIS estimated there were 583,420 foreign nationals on H-1B visas in the United States. Between 1991 and 2022, the number of H-1B visas issued quadrupled. 265,777 H-1B visas were approved in 2022, the second-largest category of visa in terms of the number of foreign workers after the 310,676 H-2A visas issued to temporary, seasonal, agriculture workers.

The H-1B program has been criticized for potentially subsidizing businesses, creating conditions likened to modern indentured servitude, institutionalizing discrimination against older workers, and suppressing wages within the technology sector. Economists and academics remain divided on the program&#x27;s overall effect, including its effects on innovation, U.S. workers, and the broader economy.

==Eligibility and application process==
The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa in the United States that allows employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, has an annual cap on the number of issued visas, and requires employers to submit paperwork that ensures compliance with various provisions of the law authorizing the visa.

=== Specialty occupation ===
H-1B visas, as defined by United States Code, are those jobs that require a &quot;theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge&quot; and a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher or the equivalent experience. In order to determine which jobs qualify under the law, the USCIS works with the Department of Labor and its Standard Occupational Classification database to determine a list of specific occupations.

=== Employment ===
To maintain H-1B visa status, visa holders must maintain employment with their sponsoring employer. If employment ends, the individual must either leave the U.S., seek a change of status, or obtain a new H-1B sponsorship. As of 2017, USCIS implemented a grace period of up to 60 days following employment termination, during which the individual may remain in the United States to seek new employment or file for a change of status.

=== Duration of status ===
The duration of stay for an H-1B visa holder is typically six years. In 2000, some exemptions were added to increase the length of stay for some visa holders:
* Permanent Residency Applications: If the visa holder has filed a Form I-140 or a Permanent Labor Certification before the fifth year of having an H-1B visa, they may extend their H-1B status in one-year increments until the government decides whether to grant permanent residency status.
* Priority Date Delays: If an approved I-140 petition exists but the applicant cannot proceed with the green card process due to a backlog, they may be eligible for a three-year extension.
* Department of Defense Projects: H-1B holders working on specific Department of Defense projects may extend their visa up to ten years.

For certain countries, the three-year extension period has been set to one-year extensions for various reasons. For example, during Melania Trump&#x27;s time as a H-1B visa holder, she was limited to one-year increments, which was the maximum time allowed for H-1B visa for citizens of Slovenia. Melania Trump became a U.S. citizen in 2006.

After six years, H-1B holders who have not obtained permanent residency must spend one year outside the U.S. before reapplying for another H-1B visa, unless they qualify for an extension under the exceptions mentioned above. Visa holders may change to a job in a specialized occupation other than the one they were approved for in their initial application providing their new job is considered a specialized occupation and that their employment is officially sponsored by their new employer.

=== Electronic registration process and lottery ===

The USCIS uses an electronic registration system and lottery process to manage applications. American employers H-1B workers must create an account on the USCIS online portal. This account enables them to submit registrations for prospective beneficiaries during the designated registration period.

USCIS announces dates for the registration period each fiscal year, typically in March. As of April 2024, the registration fee is $215 per beneficiary. This fee is non-refundable and must be paid at the time of registration. Employers provide basic information about their company and each prospective beneficiary. USCIS states the streamlined process reduces the administrative burden compared to submitting full petitions initially.

The annual H-1B season officially starts in March of each year, when petitioners are allowed to register electronically for their applicant. If more registrations are submitted there will be a random selection, also called an H-1B lottery. After the registration period closes, USCIS conducts the lottery and notifies selected registrants. Employers with selected registrations have a limited period, typically 90 days, to submit completed H-1B petitions (Form I-129) for their beneficiaries. The earliest date for filing these petitions is usually April 1.

During the 2024 fiscal-year lottery, there were 758,994 eligible electronic registrations and 110,791 people selected for an H-1B visa.

Selected registrants can begin filing their Labor Condition Application with the Department of Labor on April 1. It allows a six-month window before the employee start date on October 1.

USCIS implements measures to prevent fraud and abuse in the registration process, including a beneficiary-specific selection process to prevent multiple registrations for the same individual by different employers. These measures aim to ensure a fair selection process.

In March 2017, a federal judge in Oregon dismissed a lawsuit challenging the H-1B visa lottery system, granting summary judgment in favor of USCIS, appying &quot;Chevron&quot; deference. The court&#x27;s ruling acknowledged USCIS&#x27;s discretion in implementing this system to address the overwhelming number of petitions received each year.

=== Labor Condition Application ===
Before an employer can hire a foreign worker under the H-1B visa program, the employer must submit a Labor Condition Application (LCA) to the U.S. Department of Labor for certification. The LCA ensures the employment of H-1B workers will not harm the wages or working conditions of U.S. workers in similar roles.

The LCA is designed to protect both U.S. and foreign workers by setting standards for wages and working conditions. Employers are prohibited from using the H-1B program to replace U.S. workers during labor disputes or to exploit foreign workers by offering substandard wages. Employers must keep detailed public records, making LCAs available for inspection by the Labor Department and members of the public upon request. The required forms to fulfill this requirement are Forms ETA-9035 and 9035. The Labor Department has different requirements for workers who are dependent on H-1B visa workers.

Employers hiring H-1B visa workers must:

According to additional rules for employers who are dependent upon H-1B workers or are willful violators of the H-1B rules:

Additional rules apply to employers who are dependent (15 percent or more of their workforce) or who have violated rules with the Department of Labor in the past.

== Maintaining status ==

===Taxation of H-1B visa holders===
H-1B visa holders are taxed based on residency status under the Substantial Presence Test. Those present in the U.S. for at least 183 weighted days over three years are resident aliens and taxed on worldwide income. Others are nonresident aliens, taxed only on U.S.-sourced income.

H-1B workers must pay Social Security and Medicare taxes, unless exempt under a Totalization Agreement. As such, visa holders may be eligible for receiving Social Security benefits upon retirement should the individual have enough credits and not barred by any totalization agreements with their home country. Employers also pay federal unemployment tax on their wages.

For tax filing, nonresidents use Form 1040-NR, while residents file Form 1040. Dual-status taxpayers (those changing residency status during the year) must file specialized returns.

H-1B holders who qualify for tax treaty benefits must file Form 8833, with additional forms for specific exemptions. Ensuring compliance with tax classification and reporting prevents penalties.

=== Dual intent ===

H-1B visas are considered &quot;dual intent&quot; because it is a temporary visa which gives visa holders the option to apply for permanent residency. Employers often support this process by sponsoring green card application for H-1B employees. Typically, visa holders will be working in the U.S. with the visa while they apply for permanent residency

===Dependents of visa holders===
H-1B visa holders can bring immediate family members, such as their spouse and children under 21, to the United States as dependents under the H-4 visa category.

An H-4 visa holder may remain in the U.S. as long as the H-1B visa holder retains legal status. An H-4 visa holder is allowed to attend school, apply for a driver&#x27;s license, and open a bank account in the U.S.

From May 26, 2015, USCIS allows some spouses of H-1B visa holders to apply for eligibility to work unrestricted in the U.S. Under the rule, the H-1B worker must either be the principal beneficiary of an approved Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (Form I-140) or have H-1B status under the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000, as amended by the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, and the spouse must be in the United States with H-4 visa status. The spouse must file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with supporting documents and a filing fee. The spouse is authorized to work in the U.S. only after the Form I-765 is approved and the spouse receives an Employment Authorization Document card. In 2022, the U.S. government issued 82,616 work permits for H-1B spouses.

===Traveling outside the U.S.===
When an H-1B worker travels outside the U.S. (except to Canada or Mexico for 30 days or less), they must have a valid visa stamp in their passport to re-enter the US. If their visa stamp has expired but they have an unexpired I-797 petition approval notice, they must visit a U.S. embassy and appear before a Department of State Consular Officer to obtain a new H-1B visa stamp.

Consular officers follow the Foreign Affairs Manual, which states that an approved USCIS petition confirms the basic requirements for H-1B classification have been met. However, officers do not re-evaluate whether the job qualifies as a specialty occupation or whether the applicant meets all position-related requirements.

While USCIS approval does not guarantee a visa, consular officers can only refuse issuance if they suspect fraud or misrepresentation. They rely on their cultural and local knowledge to assess credibility. If concerns arise, they may request additional evidence or take more time to decide. If issues are confirmed, the case is sent back to USCIS for review, where the petition is either reaffirmed or revoked. Consular officers themselves do not have the authority to revoke USCIS-approved petitions.

In some visa-application cases, H-1B workers can be required to undergo &quot;administrative processing&quot; involving extra background checks. Under current rules, these checks are supposed to take ten or fewer days but in some cases, have lasted years.

An individual with a valid H-1B visa does not need a visa to enter Costa Rica for tourism for up to 30 days. The H-1B visa must be stamped in the passport and be valid for at least six months. The passport must be valid for at least six months after entering Costa Rica.

==== Domestic Visa Renewal Pilot Program (2024) ====
The Department of State introduced a limited Domestic Visa Renewal Pilot Program from January 29 to April 1, 2024, to simplify the H-1B visa renewal process. This program allowed select H-1B visa holders who had previously received their visas from specific consulates in Canada or India to renew them within the U.S., avoiding the need for international travel.

Capped at 20,000 participants, the program offered 4,000 filing slots per week over five weeks. It was limited to H-1B renewals for applicants not subject to reciprocity fees or requiring in-person interviews. Those whose previous H-1B visa were marked “Clearance Received,&quot; indicating a prior Security Advisory Opinion, were not eligible to participate.

===Unemployment===
If an employer lays off an H-1B worker, the employer is required to pay the &quot;reasonable&quot; costs of the laid-off worker&#x27;s transportation outside the U.S. If an H-1B worker is laid off or quits, the worker has a grace period of 60 days or until the I-94 expiration date, whichever is shorter, to find a new employer or leave the country.

There is a 10-day grace period for an H-1B worker to depart the U.S. at the end of their authorized period of stay. This grace period applies only if the worker works until the H-1B expiration date listed on their I-797 approval notice or I-94 card.

== Annual cap ==
The H-1B visa program is subject to an annual cap of 65,000 visas, with an additional 20,000 visas available for applicants holding advanced degrees from U.S. institutions. Certain employers are exempt from these caps, including:

* Institutions of higher education
* Nonprofit and governmental research organizations
* cap-exemption employees (those who have already received H-1B visas)
* applications to work in the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam
* Chilean and Singaporean nationals

Applicants seeking to work in the U.S. territories of the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam are exempt under the Consolidated Natural Resources Act (2008) for petitions filed before December 31, 2029. They are restricted to work only in the territory (NMI or Guam) for which they are approved.

Nationals of Chile and Singapore are subject to free-trade agreements between the U.S. and those countries. Those agreements create separate quotas of 1,400 for Chile and 5,400 for Singapore. Unused application quotas are added to the general cap for H-1B visas for the following year.

Australian citizens are eligible for the visa category, the E-3 visa, specifically designated for Australian nationals. E-3 visas are not subject to the H-1B cap and offer an alternative route for Australian professionals to seek employment in the United States. It has an annual cap of 10,500 visas, and a different duration and application process.

==History==
=== Visa creation ===
On June 27, 1952, Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act after overriding a veto by President Harry S. Truman. For the first time, the Immigration and Nationality Act codified United States&#x27; immigration, naturalization, and nationality law into permanent statutes, and introduced a system of selective immigration by giving special preference to foreigners having skills that were urgently needed by the U.S. Several types of visas were established, including a H-1 visa for &quot;an alien having a residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning who is of distinguished merit and ability and who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform temporary services of an exceptional nature requiring such merit and ability.&quot; The term &quot;distinguished merit and ability&quot; was not new to U.S. immigration law; it had previously been used as a qualification for musicians and artists who had wanted to enter the country. The visa was called an H-1 visa because it was enacted by section 101(15)(H)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

=== The Immigration Act of 1990 ===
President George H. W. Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law by on November 20, 1990. The H-1 visa was split into the H-1A visa for nurses, and the H-1B visa for workers in specialty occupations. The Immigration Act defined a specialty occupation as &quot;an occupation that requires theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge, and attainment of a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States.&quot; To qualify, a visa applicant needed any applicable state license for the particular occupation, and either an educational degree related to the occupation or an equivalent amount of professional experience. For the first time, a quota of 65,000 H-1B visas available each fiscal year was established. Employers were required by law to pay such employees at least the prevailing wage for the position, and to make certain attestations by way of a Labor Condition Application.

=== The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 ===
President Bill Clinton signed the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act into law on October 21, 1998. The law required each application for an H-1B to include an additional $500 payment that would be used for retraining U.S. workers to reduce the future need for H-1B visas. The quota of H-1B visas was increased from 65,000 to 115,000 for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 only. For an employer with a large number of employees in H-1B status or one who had committed a willful misrepresentation in the recent past, the employer was required to attest the additional H-1B worker would not displace any U.S. workers. The act also gave investigative authority to the United States Department of Labor.

=== The American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act of 2000 ===
On October 17, 2000, President Bill Clinton signed into law the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act, which increased the retraining fee from $500 to $1,000. The quota was increased to 195,000 H-1B visas in fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003 only. Nonprofit research institutions sponsoring workers for H-1B visas became exempt from the H-1B visa quotas.

Under the law, a worker in H-1B status who had already been subject to a visa quota would not be subject to quotas if requesting a transfer to a new employer or if applying for a three-year extension. An H-1B worker was now allowed to change employers if the worker had an I-485 application pending for six months and an approved I-140, and if the new job was substantially comparable to their current one.

In the case of an H-1B holder&#x27;s spouse in H-4 status, the spouse may be eligible to work in the U.S under certain circumstances. The spouse must have an approved &quot;Immigration Petition for Alien Worker&quot; form or have been given H-1B status under sections 106(a) and (b) of the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act of 2000.

=== Free trade agreements in 2003 ===
Congress ratified the Singapore–United States Free Trade Agreement in 2003, and later that year, the Chile–United States Free Trade Agreement. With these free trade agreements, a new H-1B1 visa that was available solely for people from either Singapore or Chile was established. Unlike H-1B visas that had a limited renewal time, H-1B1 visas could be indefinitely renewed. H-1B1 visas are subject to a separate quota of 6,000 per fiscal year. Unlike H-1B visas, an H-1B1 visa is not a dual-intent visa, and an H-1B1 applicant must convince the visa officer they have no intention of permanently immigrating to the United States.

=== The H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004 ===
The H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004 was a part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, which President George W. Bush signed on December 6, 2004. For employers with 26 or more employees, the retraining fee was increased from $1,000 to $1,500, and it was reduced to $750 for all other employers. A new $500 &quot;anti-fraud fee&quot; was to be paid by the employer with the visa application. The H-1B quota returned to 65,000 per year and the law added 20,000 visas for applicants with J-1 status with either a master&#x27;s degree or a doctorate degree from a U.S. graduate school. Governmental entities became exempt from H-1B visa quotas. According to the law, H-1B visas that were revoked due to either fraud or willful misrepresentation would be added to the H-1B visa quota for the following fiscal year. The law also allowed one-year extensions for H-1B visa holders who were applying for permanent residency and whose petitions had been pending for a long time. The Department of Labor had more investigative authority, but an employer could defend against misdeeds by using either the Good Faith Compliance Defense or the Recognized Industry Standards Defense.

=== Proposed legislation in 2007 ===
In 2207, Senators Dick Durbin of Illinois and Charles Grassley of Iowa began introducing &quot;The H-1B and L-1 Visa Fraud &amp; Prevention Act&quot; in 2007. According to Durbin, speaking in 2009: &quot;The H-1B visa program should complement the U.S. workforce, not replace it ... The ... program is plagued with fraud and abuse and is now a vehicle for outsourcing that deprives qualified American workers of their jobs.&quot; Compete America, a tech industry lobbying group, opposed the proposed legislation.

=== The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 ===
The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 federalized immigration in the U.S. territory of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and it stipulated during a transition period, numerical limitations would not apply to otherwise qualified workers in the H visa category in the U.S. territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. The exemption does not apply to any employment to be performed outside of those territories.

=== The Employ American Workers Act of 2009 ===
The Employ American Workers Act, as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, was signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009. Employers who applied to sponsor a new H-1B applicant and who had received funds under either the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) or the Federal Reserve Act Section 13 were required to attest the additional H-1B worker would not displace any U.S. workers, and that the employer had not laid off and would not lay off any U.S. worker in a job equivalent to the H-1B position in the area of intended employment of the H-1B worker in the period beginning 90 days prior to the filing of the H-1B petition and ending 90 days after its filing.

=== Proposed legislation in 2017-2018 ===
In 2017, the U.S. Congress considered more-than doubling the minimum wage for an H-1B holder from the $60,000 (USD) established in 1989 and unchanged since then. The High Skilled Integrity and Fairness Act, which U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California introduced, would raise H-1B holders&#x27; minimum salaries to $130,000. The Indian press criticized the action for confirming &quot;the worst fears of [Indian] IT companies&quot; following the reforms discussed during the 2016 Presidential election by both major candidates, and for causing a 5% drop in the BSE SENSEX index. Though, India in general has been welcoming this change and requirement since 2015. Lofgren&#x27;s office described it as a measure to &quot;curb outsourcing abuse,&quot; citing unfair tech hiring practices by employers including Disney and University of California San Francisco.

=== Executive action history ===
Since 2008, USCIS has updated and issued new rules regarding the H-1B visa.

==== STEM Optional Practical Training extension and cap-gap extension ====
On April 2, 2008, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff announced a 17-month extension to Optional Practical Training for STEM students, as part of the H-1B Cap-Gap Regulations. This extension allows foreign STEM students to work in the U.S. for up to 29 months on a student visa, providing additional time to secure H-1B sponsorship.

To qualify for the standard 12-month OPT, a bachelor’s degree in any field is acceptable. However, the 17-month STEM extension requires a degree in an approved STEM major, as listed by USCIS. The cap-gap extension, introduced alongside this rule, allows STEM OPT workers with pending or approved H-1B petitions to remain in the U.S. while awaiting the start of their H-1B status.

==== The 2010 Neufeld Memo ====
On January 8, 2010, USCIS issued a memorandum clarifying that a valid employer-employee relationship must exist between an H-1B employer and visa-holding employee, although the memo was ultimately not implemented. The memo stated that employers must demonstrate control over when, where, and how the employee performs their work to maintain compliance.

A valid employer-employee relationship typically includes:

* supervision of the employee, either on-site or remotely.
* control over work assignments, schedules, and tasks.
* provision of tools, equipment, and resources necessary for the job.
* authority to hire, pay, evaluate, and terminate employment.
* employee benefits and use of employer-provided proprietary information.

The memo emphasized that common law principles guide the assessment of these factors.

Third-party placement firms and staffing agencies generally do not qualify for H-1B sponsorship. Senator John Cornyn helped negotiate a halt to the memo’s implementation following concerns from IT outsourcing firms.

==== 2015 H-1B dependent work authorization ====
Under this rule, an H-1B worker’s spouse in H-4 status may obtain work authorization if the H-1B holder is either:

# the principal beneficiary of an approved I-140, or
# maintaining H-1B status under the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000.

DHS implemented this rule to ease financial burdens on families transitioning from non-immigrant to permanent resident status. It also helps retain high-skilled workers by reducing incentives for them to leave the U.S., preventing disruptions for their employers and the economy.

==== 2015 work site guidance change ====
In 2015, USCIS issued final guidance stating if an H-1B worker whose worksite location changes to a different metropolitan area, it is a material change that requires the employer to certify a new Labor Condition Application to the DHS. Temporary worksite changed do not require a new LCA. Examples include a H-1B worker attending a training session, seminar, or conference of short duration, or a temporary moved to a short-term placement of fewer than 30 days. If the amended H-1B petition is disapproved but the original petition remains valid, the H-1B worker retains their H-1B status as long as they return to work at the original worksite.

==== 2016 H-1B maximum stay clarification ====
On December 5, 2016, USCIS issued a memorandum to provide guidance for periods of admissions for an individual in H-1B status. The memorandum stated time spent as either an H-4 dependent or an L-2 dependent does not reduce the maximum allowable period of stay available to individuals in H-1B status.

==== 2017 employment termination grace period rule ====
On November 18, 2017, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services released a rule that affects individuals in H-1B status whose employment ends. In these cases, the individual has a grace period of 60 days to leave the United States or change to another legal status that allows them to remain in the United States.

==== 2017 H-4 victims of domestic violence work authorization ====
In 2005, the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act allowed work authorization for victims of domestic violence who are in H-4 status. On February 17, 2017, USCIS instituted a process for these victims to apply for work authorization.

Eligible individuals include current H-1B visa spouses and individuals whose marriage ended because of battery or extreme cruelty perpetrated by the individual&#x27;s former spouse. The individual must have entered the U.S. in an H status, must continue to be in H-4 status, and were themselves or their child battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by the H-1B spouse. The spouse&#x27;s application must include evidence of the abuse. Before this policy was implemented, an abused spouse in H-4 status would be required to leave the U.S. on the date the person divorced the abusive spouse. The divorced spouse may now legally remain in and work in the U.S. after the divorce is finalized or pending. If approved, the authorization is valid for two years.

==== 2017 computer-programming position memo ====
A memorandum from December 22, 2000, stated because most computer-programming positions required a bachelor&#x27;s degree, computer programming was considered a specialty occupation that qualified for an H-1B visa. On March 31, 2017, USCIS released a memorandum stating computer programming would no longer be automatically considered a specialty occupation, partly because a bachelor&#x27;s degree was no longer typically required for these positions. An application for an H-1B visa for a computer programmer must sufficiently describe the duties, and the level of experience and responsibilities of the position to demonstrate how the position is senior, complex, specialized, or unique rather than an entry-level position to qualify for an H-1B visa. In addition, the Department of Justice warned employers not to discriminate against U.S. workers by showing a preference for hiring H-1B workers.

==== 2017 Buy American, Hire American executive order ====
On April 18, 2017, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to implement a &quot;Buy American, Hire American&quot; strategy, a key pledge of his campaign. At a press briefing, the executive order directed federal agencies such as the Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, the DHS, and the Department of State to implement a new system that favored higher-skilled, higher-paid applicants. The executive order was intended to order federal agencies to review and propose reforms to the H-1B visa system. Furthermore, these departments will &quot;fill in the details with reports and recommendations about what the administration can legally do.&quot; Trump stated the executive order would &quot;end the theft of American prosperity,&quot; which he said had been brought on by low-wage immigrant labor.

On January 9, 2018, the USCIS said it was not considering any proposal that would force H-1B visa holders to leave the U.S. during the green-card process. USCIS said an employer could request extensions in one-year increments under section 106(a)–(b) of the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act instead.

==== 2018 extension rejection rule ====
On June 28, 2018, the USCIS announced when a person&#x27;s request for a visa extension is rejected, the person will be deported from the country. The Trump administration said it was not considering any proposal that would force H-1B visa holders to leave the country.

==== 2020 H-1B entry suspension ====
On April 22, 2020, President Trump signed a presidential proclamation that temporarily suspended the entry of people with non-immigrant visas, including H-1B visas. On June 22, 2020, President Trump extended the suspension for H-1B visa holders until December 31, 2020. On December 31, 2020, Trump issued a presidential proclamation extending the suspension of entry until March 31, 2021, because they would pose &quot;a risk of displacing and disadvantaging United States workers during the economic recovery following the COVID-19 outbreak.&quot;

==== 2020 H-1B lottery rule ====
On October 28, 2020, a new rule to reform the H-1B lottery by prioritizing workers with the highest wage was approved.

==== 2021 H-1B entry suspension expiration ====
President Joe Biden allowed the suspension to expire on March 31, 2021, which allowed H-1B visa holders to enter the U.S. beginning on April 1, 2021.

== In politics and culture ==

=== 2015 spotlight on H-1B visas ===
In 2015, reports surfaced of major companies like Disney and Southern California Edison replacing American workers with H-1B visa holders, sometimes requiring displaced employees to train their replacements as a condition for severance. The &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial board criticized the program for exploiting both foreign and domestic workers due to loopholes and weak enforcement.

Following these revelations, ten U.S. senators urged the Department of Labor to investigate outsourcing practices at Southern California Edison, which had laid off 500 employees. After a ten-month review, the department found no legal violations.

The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings in 2015 and 2016, led by Senators Chuck Grassley and Jeff Sessions, to examine how the H-1B program affected U.S. workers. Witnesses, including labor leaders and economists, testified that companies were not required to prioritize American workers, allowing employers to use the program to import cheaper foreign labor instead of filling skills gaps. Senator Grassley characterized the program as favoring employers over U.S. workers rather than serving its intended purpose.

=== 2016 election policy issue ===

The H-1B visa program was a contentious issue in the 2016 presidential election. Donald Trump pledged to overhaul the system, arguing that it displaced American IT workers and suppressed wages. His campaign proposed raising the prevailing wage for H-1B workers to encourage hiring U.S. citizens and legal immigrants.

Hillary Clinton criticized the program for enabling employers to hire cheaper, more compliant foreign workers but viewed H-1B reform as part of broader immigration policy changes.

Bernie Sanders opposed guest worker programs and was skeptical of H-1B visas, citing their role in offshoring American jobs. He also rejected open-border policies, emphasizing the need to raise wages and prioritize domestic employment.

=== 2019 H-1B data ===
In 2019, USCIS launched the H-1B Employer Data Hub, providing public access to information on H-1B visa petitions dating back to fiscal year 2009. That same year, the USCIS Office of Policy and Strategy released an updated estimate of H-1B visa holders in the U.S. As of September 30, 2019, 583,420 individuals were authorized to work on an H-1B visa.

USCIS estimated a total of 619,327 approved unique beneficiaries, adjusting for 2,100 visa denials by the State Department and subtracting 32,332 individuals who had obtained lawful permanent residency. An additional 1,475 visa holders had changed to a different non-immigrant status.

=== 2021 electronic registration system ===
In 2021, USCIS launched its first electronic registration system for the H-1B lottery.

==Economic effects==
There is a division between economists and academics about the effects of H-1B visas on innovation, U.S. workers, and overall benefits to the U.S. economy. Studies have shown H-1B visas have welfare-improving effects for Americans, leading to significant wage gains, lower consumer prices, greater innovation, and greater total factor productivity growth. H-1B visas have led to lower prices for consumers, greater output, and improved performance by companies. A study found H-1B visa holders have been associated with greater innovation and economic performance. Other studies have shown the opposite. A National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) paper concluded firms who received H-1B visas do not necessarily innovate or grow more quickly, nor patent more than firms that do not.

Economists have also found H-1B visas lead to lower wages and employment for competing U.S. workers. A paper by George J. Borjas for the NBER found &quot;a 10 percent immigration-induced increase in the supply of doctorates lowers the wage of competing workers by about 3 to 4 percent.&quot; A 2016 study found H-1B visas kept wages for U.S. computer scientists 2.6% to 5.1% lower, and employment in computer science for U.S. workers 6.1% to 10.8% lower, but resulted in greater production efficiency, lowered the prices of IT products, raised the output of IT products, and caused substantially higher profits for IT firms.

==Criticism==

=== Corporate welfare ===

Critics of the H-1B visa program say it is a government labor subsidy for corporations. Paul Donnelly, in a 2002 article in &quot;Computerworld&quot;, cited Milton Friedman as stating the H-1B program acts as a subsidy for corporations. Others holding this view include Norman Matloff, who testified to the U.S. House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Immigration on the H-1B subject. Matloff describes four types of labor savings for corporations and employers:

* Type I labor savings is where employers pay H-1Bs less than similarly qualified American workers. 
* Type II labor savings are where employers hire younger H-1Bs in lieu of older and more expensive American workers. 
* Type III labor savings are where employers force H-1B workers to work longer hours.
* Type IV labor savings are when the oversaturation of H-1B workers suppresses wages in the labor market. 
American technology companies are claimed to benefit most from Type II labor savings, where these firms hire a 25-year-old H-1B worker instead of a 50-year-old American programmer.

===No labor shortage===
Academic researchers have found no labor shortage in STEM, undercutting the primary reason for the H-1B visa&#x27;s existence. In 2022, Howard University public policy professor Ron Hira found there was no shortage in STEM due to stagnant wages in IT and a seven percent decline in real wages for engineers. In the past, he has called the IT talent shortage &quot;imaginary,&quot; and a front for companies that want to hire cheaper foreign guest workers.

Studies from Rutgers University professor Hal Salzman, and co-authors B. Lindsay Lowell and Daniel Kuehn, have concluded the U.S. has been employing only 30% to 50% of its newly degreed, able and willing STEM workers to work in STEM fields. Salzman points to simultaneous industry layoffs, when industry claims labor shortage. In his Senate Judiciary testimony, he stated between 2006 and 2016, the IT industry, the predominant user of the H-1B visa, laid off on average 97,000 workers per year, more than the number of 74,000 H-1B workers brought for the IT industry.

A 2012 IEEE announcement of a conference on STEM education funding and job markets stated: &quot;only about half of those with under-graduate STEM degrees actually work in the STEM-related fields after college, and after 10 years, only some 8% still do.&quot; Norman Matloff&#x27;s &quot;University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform&quot; paper said there has been no shortage of qualified American citizens to fill American computer-related jobs, and that the data offered as evidence of American corporations needing H-1B visas to address labor shortages was erroneous. The United States General Accounting Office (GAO) found in a 2000 report controls on the H-1B program lacked effectiveness. The GAO report&#x27;s recommendations were subsequently implemented.

High-tech companies often cite a tech-worker shortage when asking Congress to raise the annual cap on H-1B visas, and have succeeded in getting exemptions passed. The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), described the situation as a crisis, and the situation was reported on by &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;, and &quot;Washington Post&quot;. Employers applied pressure on Congress. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates testified in 2007 on behalf of the expanded visa program on Capitol Hill: &quot;warning of dangers to the U.S. economy if employers can&#x27;t import skilled workers to fill job gaps.&quot; Congress considered a bill to address the claims of a shortfall but did not revise the program.

According to a study conducted by John Miano and the Center for Immigration Studies, there is no empirical data to support a claim of a worker shortage. Citing studies from Duke, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Georgetown University and others, critics have also argued in some years, the number of foreign programmers and engineers imported outnumbered the number of jobs created by the industry. Hire Americans First has posted hundreds of first-hand accounts of H-1B visa harm reports from individuals who were harmed by the program.

====Wage depression====
Critics of the H-1B program often complain about wage depression as a result of an increased supply of discounted guest workers. In the 21st century, labor experts have found guest workers are abundantly available in times of wage decline and weak workforce demand. The Economic Policy Institute found sixty percent of certified H-1B positions were paid below the local median wage. In Washington D.C, companies hiring a level-1 entry-level H-1B software developer received a discount of 36%, or $41,746. For level-II workers, companies received a discount of 18%, or $20,863.

In 2014, The Department of Homeland Security annual report indicates that H-1B workers in computer Science are paid a mean salary of $75,000 annually, almost 25,000 dollars below the average annual income for software developers and studies have found H-1B workers are paid significantly less than U.S. workers. Some critics have said the H-1B program is primarily used as a source of cheap labor.

==== Prevailing wage loopholes ====
The Labor Condition Application (LCA) included in the H-1B petition is supposed to ensure H-1B workers are paid the prevailing wage in the labor market or the employer&#x27;s actual average wage, whichever is higher, but there is evidence some employers get around these provisions and avoid paying the prevailing wage despite stiff penalties for abusers. The LCA process appears to offer protection to both U.S. and H-1B workers but according to the U.S. General Accounting Office, enforcement limitations and procedural problems render these protections ineffective. The employer, not the Department of Labor, determines what sources determine the prevailing wage for an offered position, and it may choose from a variety of competing surveys, including its own wage surveys, provided such surveys follow rules and regulations.

The law restricts the Department of Labor&#x27;s approval process of LCAs to checking for &quot;completeness and obvious inaccuracies.&quot; In FY 2005, only about 800 LCAs of over 300,000 submitted were rejected. Hire American First has posted several hundred first-hand accounts of individuals negatively affected by the program. According to attorney John Miano, the H-1B prevailing wage requirement is &quot;rife&quot; with loopholes.

==== Internal &quot;brain drain&quot; ====
Opponents of the H-1B visa program says wage depression in STEM causes young American college graduates to stop pursuing these fields.

=== Discrimination ===
====Against American citizens ====
Critics of the H-1B visa program have said it enables Silicon Valley to discriminate against U.S. citizens and permanent residents. In 2021, Facebook settled a claim with the Department of Justice that it discriminated against U.S. workers in favor of temporary visa holders. The company paid a $4.75-million civil penalty and set aside $9.5 million for eligible victims.

==== Ageism ====
Critics of the H-1B visa program say the program enables Silicon Valley to discriminate against older workers.

===Wage slavery===

According to critics, H-1B holders constitute a modern-day form of high-tech indentured servants, Guest workers on H-1B visas in the IT sector have limited employer mobility compared to U.S. workers. Although immigration generally requires short- and long-term visitors to disavow any ambition to seek the permanent residency, H-1B visa holders are an important exception because the H-1B is legally acknowledged as a possible step towards a green card under the doctrine of dual intent.

Some workers who come to the U.S. on H-1B visas receive poor, unfair, and illegal treatment by brokers who place them with jobs in the U.S., according to a report published in 2014. The United States Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2013 was passed to help protect the rights of foreign workers in the U.S., and the U.S. Department of State distributes pamphlets to inform foreign workers of their rights.

Companies have stolen the wages of H-1B workers. Labor researchers found HCLTech stole $95 million from its H-1B visa workers annually. Critics say employers exercise outsized control over H-1B workers because the visa ties workers to their employers. These workers are less likely to complain about poor working conditions for fear of visa revocation and deportation.

=== Dual intent ===
In 2017, President Donald Trump expressed concerns about using the H-1B visa as a pathway to permanent residency and proposed restructuring the immigration system, including introducing a points-based system. In response, some individuals sought alternative routes to permanent residency, such as the EB-5 visa program, which offers a more direct path. Advocacy groups opposing changes to H-1B policies launched public awareness campaigns, including posters in the San Francisco Bay Area’s Rapid Tansit system.

===Body shopping and offshoring===

Critics of the program criticize American and outsourcing companies for using H-1B visa workers to body shop and offshore work abroad. Researchers have found two thirds of IT jobs are offshorable, and the remaining third remain onshore to be the conduit between American clients and offshore work teams.

The leading users of H-1B visas are Indian outsourcing firms. In 2021, half of the top-thirty employers of H-1B visa holders were outsourcing firms. The top-10 H-1B employers in 2014 such as Tata Consultancy, Cognizant, Infosys, Wipro, Accenture, HCL America, and IBM all used the program to ship jobs offshore. Critics of H-1B use for outsourcing have also noted more H-1B visas are granted to companies headquartered in India than to companies headquartered in the United States. Although these IT outsourcing companies have a physical presence in the U.S., they hire temporary foreign guest workers.

Senator Dick Durbin stated in a speech on H-1B visa reform:
The H-1B job visa lasts for three years and can be renewed for three years. What happens to those workers after that? Well, they could stay. It is possible. But these new companies have a much better idea for making money. They send the engineers to America to fill spots—and get money to do it—and then after the three to six years, they bring them back to work for the companies that are competing with American companies. They call it their outsourcing visa. They are sending their talented engineers to learn how Americans do business and then bring them back and compete with those American companies.Of all computer systems analysts and programmers on H-1B visas in the U.S., 74 percent were from Asia.

Large migration of Asian IT professionals to the U.S. has been a central component to the emergence of the offshore outsourcing industry. In FY 2009, due to the worldwide recession, applications for H-1B visas by offshore outsourcing firms were significantly lower than in previous years, yet 110,367 H-1B visas were issued, and 117,409 were issued in FY2010. &quot;Computerworld&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; have reported on the inordinate share of H-1B visas received by firms that specialize in offshore outsourcing, the subsequent inability of employers to hire foreign professionals with legitimate technical and language skill combinations, and the replacement of American professionals already performing their job functions and being coerced to train their foreign replacements.

==== Training foreign replacements ====
There have been cases where employers used the program to replace their American employees with H-1B employees; in some cases, the laid-off employees were ordered to train their replacements. In 2013 Northeast Utilities laid off 350 tech workers, many of whom trained their replacements who were hired on H-1B visas to do their jobs. In October 2014, Walt Disney World laid off 250 IT workers, some of whose final assigned task for the company was to train their replacements who&#x27;d been hired on H-1B visas. Southern California Edison laid off 540 tech workers in 2014, requiring many to train their replacements who&#x27;d been hired on H-1B visas. Fossil laid off 100 tech workers and hired 25 on H-1B visas who were then trained by the laid-off employees in what Fossil termed &quot;knowledge sharing.&quot; Researchers have found during the 2022 tech layoffs, companies laid off their U.S. workforce while continuing to bring in more H-1B workers. The top-30 H-1B employers in 2022 laid off at least 85,000 workers, while bringing in 34,000 H-1B workers.

=== Limitations for entrepreneurs and self-employed consultants ===
Entrepreneurs do not qualify for the H-1B visa. The United States immigration system&#x27;s EB-5 visa program does permit foreign entrepreneurs to apply for a green card if they make a sufficient investment in a commercial enterprise and intend to create 10 or more jobs in the United States. In 2014, the University of Massachusetts began a program allowing entrepreneurs to found U.S. companies while fulfilling visa requirements by teaching and mentoring on campus, with the university as sponsoring employer. Self-employed consultants have no visa that allows them to enter the country and perform work independently for unspecified, extended periods. A B-1 visa would permit temporary travel to the U.S. to consult for specific periods. Consulting companies have been formed for the sole purpose of sponsoring employees on H-1B visas to allow them to perform work for clients, with the company sharing the resulting profit.

=== Fraud ===
According to the USCIS&#x27;s H-1B Benefit Fraud &amp; Compliance Assessment of September 2008, 21% of H-1B visas granted originate from applications that were fraudulent or had technical violations. Fraud was defined as a willful misrepresentation, falsification, or omission of a material fact. Technical violations, errors, omissions, and failures to comply that are not within the fraud definition were included in the 21% rate.

In 2009, federal authorities arrested people for a nationwide H-1B visa scam in which the perpetrators allegedly submitted false statements and documents in connection with petitions for H-1B visas. Fraud has included acquisition of a fake university degree for the prospective H-1B worker, coaching the worker to lie to consul officials, hiring a worker for which there is no U.S. job, charging the worker money to be hired, benching the worker with no pay, and taking a cut of the worker&#x27;s U.S. salary. The workers, who have little choice in the matter, are also engaged in fraud and may be charged, fined, and deported.

Outsourcing companies game the lottery system by filing as many electronic lottery applications as possible for $10 each for jobs that do not exist. In 2023, there were 781,000 lottery entries for 85,000 visas. This was partly the result of different companies submitting the same applicant multiple times. USCIS said there is a high prevalence of fraud with the new electronic registration system.

He gave up the seat in 1984 to run for the Democratic nomination in the when Al Gore gave it up to make a successful run for the United States Senate. He narrowly lost the primary to state Democratic Party chairman Bart Gordon. Ten years later, he ran for the Democratic nomination in the 4th District after Jim Cooper gave up the seat to make an unsuccessful run for Gore&#x27;s Senate seat. He lost narrowly again, this time to one of Cooper&#x27;s former assistants, Jeff Whorley, who in turn lost the general election to Republican Van Hilleary. In 1996, he was elected to the Tennessee State Senate and served two terms there. He represented the 12th district.

While in the Tennessee General Assembly, Davis supported state employee and teacher pay raises, long-term care for senior citizens, character education in schools and new domestic violence legislation. Davis initiated and fought for a bill requiring counseling and a 12-hour holding period for domestic violence offenders.

Davis is a moderate Democrat by Tennessee standards, but a conservative Democrat by national ones. Davis made headlines for his opposition to the Federal Marriage Amendment. He is also known for his opposition to bailing out Wall Street and cap-and-trade legislation. Davis spent time focusing on funding abandoned coal mines in Tennessee. He has supported efforts to fund long-term care for senior citizens and has advocated new domestic violence legislation.

He opposes abortion and gun control, stances typical of most Democrats from rural areas of the state. During his first run for Congress, he vowed not to allow his Republican opponents to &quot;outgun me, outpray me or outfamily me.&quot; In April 2009, Davis voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.

==Political campaigns==

===2002===

Midway through his second term in the State Senate, in 2002, Davis ran for the Democratic nomination in the 4th District when four-term Republican incumbent Van Hilleary gave up the seat to make what would ultimately be an unsuccessful run for governor. This time, he narrowly won the primary against a self-funding opponent, Fran Marcum of Tullahoma, who spent nearly $2 million in the race. He went on to win a hard-fought battle in the general election, narrowly defeating Republican Tullahoma Alderman Janice Bowling, 52%-47%; Bowling was Hilleary&#x27;s district director.

===2004===

Davis was reelected in a 2004 rematch against Bowling with slightly less difficulty, 55%-44%.

===2006===

Davis faced nominal opposition in 2006. Although the 4th was not considered safe for either major party, its size (it stretches across two time zones and five television markets) made it very difficult to unseat an incumbent.

Davis defeated Republican Kenneth Martin, 67.5%-32.5%.

===2008===

Davis did not make an endorsement of the candidate in advance of the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Hillary Clinton won the primary in his district by a significant margin, and John McCain outran Barack Obama there by 29 percentage points.

In the November 2008 general election, Davis defeated Republican candidate Monty Lankford, a hospital equipment company owner. Afterwards Davis was appointed to the House Appropriations Committee and the Energy &amp; Water Subcommittee.

===2010===
Davis was considered a possible candidate for Governor of Tennessee in 2010. However, he announced that he had decided not to seek that office in January 2009, and instead ran for reelection to his House seat.

In the 2010 congressional race, Davis was challenged by Republican Scott DesJarlais. Also on the ballot were independents Paul H. Curtis, James Gray, Richard S. Johnson, and Gerald York. DesJarlais won 57.1% of the vote to Davis&#x27;s 38.6%--the third-largest margin of defeat for a Democratic incumbent in the 2010 cycle, the first time an incumbent had been unseated since the district&#x27;s creation in 1983, and the first time since 1974 that an incumbent congressman in Tennessee lost a general election.

==Voting incident==

In the wake of Tennessee passing a strict voter identification law in 2011, Davis was denied the right to vote in Fentress County on Super Tuesday in March 2012. Davis had voted in the county for about fifteen years but was purged from the roll of registered voters.

<doc id="418657" wikidata="Q4684563" url="?curid=418657" title="Adoption (theology)">
<text>Adoption, in Christian theology, is the reception of a believer into the family of God. In the Reformed &quot;ordo salutis&quot; (&quot;order of salvation&quot;), adoption is usually regarded as a step immediately subsequent to justification. As a theological word, adoption has similar connotations to the act of parents who legally take responsibility for a child who was not originally born to them. There are three references in the New Testament to God &quot;adopting&quot; () Christians as his own children (Galatians 4:5, Romans 8:15 and Ephesians 1:5) and one reference to God adopting the &quot;people of Israel&quot; (Romans 9:4). Adoption as a theological term introduces a relational dimension to the consequences of salvation.

Adoption as a theological concept is also another consequence of the &#x27;legal&#x27; act of justification, alongside redemption and reconciliation. The Old Testament precedent for this term comes from the story of Mephibosheth, who despite not being part of Davidic family was included in the Royal inheritance (2 Samuel 9:7-13). Adoption is an important feature of Reformation theology as demonstrated by article 12 of the Westminster Confession of Faith:

<doc id="418664" wikidata="Q1392134" url="?curid=418664" title="1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak">
<text>From May 2 to 8, 1999, a large tornado outbreak took place across much of the Central and parts of the Eastern United States, as well as southern Canada. During this week-long event, 152 tornadoes touched down in these areas. The most dramatic events unfolded during the afternoon of May 3 through the early morning hours of May 4 when more than half of these storms occurred. Oklahoma experienced its largest tornado outbreak on record, with 70 confirmed. The most notable of these was the F5 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado which devastated Oklahoma City and suburban communities. The tornado killed 36 people and injured 583 others; losses amounted to $1 billion, making it the first billion-dollar tornado in history. Overall, 50 people lost their lives during the outbreak and damage amounted to $1.4 billion. For these reasons, the outbreak is known in Oklahoma as the May 3 outbreak or the Oklahoma tornado outbreak of 1999.

On May 2, a strong area of low pressure moved out of the Rocky Mountains and into the High Plains, producing scattered severe weather and ten tornadoes in Nebraska. The following day, atmospheric conditions across Oklahoma became significantly more favorable for an outbreak of severe weather. Wind profiles across the region strongly favored tornadic activity, with the Storm Prediction Center stating, &quot;it became more obvious something major was looming&quot; by the afternoon hours. Numerous supercell thunderstorms developed across the state as well as bordering areas in Kansas and Texas. Over the following 48 hours, May 3–4, 116 tornadoes touched down across the Central United States. Following the extensive outbreak, activity became increasingly scattered from May 5 to 8, with 26 tornadoes touching down across the Eastern United States and Quebec.

==Meteorological synopsis==

The outbreak was caused by a 
powerful upper-level trough that pushed
 into the Central and Southern Plains states on the morning of May 3. That morning, low stratus clouds overspread much of Oklahoma, with clear skies along and west of a dry line located from Gage to Childress, Texas. Air temperatures at 7:00 a.m. Central Daylight Time ranged in the mid to upper 60s °F (upper 10s to near 20 °C) across the region, while dew point values ranged in the low to mid 60s °F (mid to upper 10s °C). The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) in Norman, Oklahoma, a division of the National Weather Service, initially issued a slight risk of severe thunderstorms early that morning stretching from the Kansas-Nebraska border to parts of southern Texas, with an intended threat of large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes.
By late morning, the low cloud cover began to dissipate in advance of the dry line, but during the afternoon hours high cirrus clouds overspread the region, resulting in filtered sunshine in some areas that caused atmospheric destabilization. The sunshine and heating, combined with abundant low-level moisture, combined to produce a very unstable air mass. Upper air balloon soundings observed strong directional wind shear, cooling temperatures at high atmospheric levels, and the increased potential of CAPE values potentially exceeding 4000 J/kg, levels that are considered favorable for supercells and tornadoes.

As observations and forecasts began to indicate an increasing likelihood of widespread severe weather conditions even more favorable for strong tornadoes, the SPC issued a moderate risk of severe weather at 11:15 a.m. CDT for portions of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas along and near the Interstate 40 corridor. By 3:00 p.m. CDT, it had become evident that a widespread severe weather event was imminent; the Storm Prediction Center upgraded locations within the moderate risk area to a high risk of severe weather around 4:00 p.m. CDT as wind shear profiles, combined with volatile atmospheric conditions, had made conditions highly conducive for a significant tornadic event across most of Oklahoma, southern Kansas and north Texas, including the likelihood of violent, damaging tornadoes. The SPC issued a tornado watch by mid-afternoon as conditions gathered together for what would be a historic tornado outbreak. By the time thunderstorms began developing in the late-afternoon hours, CAPE values over the region had reached to near 6,000 J/kg. Large supercell thunderstorms developed, and in the late afternoon through the mid-evening hours of that Monday, tornadoes began to break out across the state.

==Confirmed tornadoes==
* Note: The above amount refers to the rest of the outbreak, not just the ones confirmed in Oklahoma.

===Bridge Creek–Moore, Oklahoma===

At approximately 3:30 p.m. CDT, a severe thunderstorm began forming in Tillman County in southwestern Oklahoma; a severe thunderstorm warning was issued for this storm by the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Norman at 4:15 p.m. CDT. The storm quickly developed supercell characteristics and began exhibiting potentially tornadic rotation, resulting in the National Weather Service issuing the first tornado warning of the event for Comanche, Caddo, and Grady counties approximately 35 minutes later at 4:50 p.m. CDT.

The first tornado from this supercell touched down east-northeast of Medicine Park at 4:51 p.m. CDT; it produced four additional tornadoes as it tracked northeast into Caddo County, the strongest of which (rated as an F3) touched down west-southwest of Laverty and dissipated west-northwest of downtown Chickasha. This large tornado had exhibited a companion satellite tornado for a few minutes.

The storm produced the most significant tornado of the outbreak, which touched down just southwest of the Grady County community of Amber at 6:23 p.m. CDT and headed northeast, parallel to Interstate 44, just after another tornado had passed over the airport in Chickasha. The storm continued moving northeast, destroying the community of Bridge Creek and crossing I-44 just north of Newcastle. The tornado then crossed the Canadian River, passing into far southern Oklahoma City. As it passed over Bridge Creek, around 6:54 p.m., a Doppler On Wheels mobile Doppler weather radar detected wind speeds of – later revised to – inside the tornado at an elevation of . These winds, however, occurred above the ground, and winds at the surface may not have been quite this intense. The tornado continued on into Moore, then passed over the intersection of Shields Boulevard and Interstate 35 and back into Oklahoma City, crossing Interstate 240 near Bryant Avenue. The storm then turned more northerly, striking parts of Del City and Tinker Air Force Base near Sooner Road as an F4. The storm damaged and/or destroyed several businesses, homes and churches in Midwest City. Some damage in this area was rated as high-end F4, although F5 was considered. The tornado diminished over Midwest City and finally lifted near the intersection of Reno Avenue and Woodcrest Drive.

Thirty-six people died in this tornado, and over 8,000 homes were badly damaged or destroyed. The tornado caused $1 billion in damage, making it the second-costliest tornado in U.S. history, and the most costly in history from 1999 to 2011, at which point it was surpassed by the 2011 Tuscaloosa–Birmingham tornado and again by the 2011 Joplin tornado. It was also the deadliest tornado to hit the U.S. since the April 10, 1979 F4 tornado that hit Wichita Falls, Texas, which killed 42 people.
===Cimarron City–Mulhall–Perry, Oklahoma===
Late in the evening on May 3 at 9:25 p.m. CDT, a destructive tornado touched down southwest of Cimarron City in Logan County, Oklahoma, eventually hitting the town of Mulhall, located north of Guthrie. This wedge tornado, which tracked a path, was very wide and at times exceeded in width. According to storm chasing meteorologist Roger Edwards, it may have been as violent or more than the F5 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado (however, it was officially rated as an F4).

A Doppler On Wheels (DOW) mobile radar observed this tornado as it crossed Mulhall. The DOW documented the largest-ever-observed core flow circulation with a distance of between peak velocities on either side of the tornado, and a roughly width of peak wind gusts exceeding , making the Mulhall tornado the largest tornado ever measured quantitatively. The DOW measured a complex multi-vortex structure, with several vortices containing winds of up to rotating around the tornado. The 3D structure of the tornado has been analyzed in a 2005 article in the &quot;Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences&quot; by Wen-Chau Lee and Joshua Wurman. The tornado severely damaged or destroyed approximately 60–70% of the 130 homes in Mulhall, destroying the Mulhall/Orlando Elementary School and toppling the city&#x27;s water tower.

After the tornado dissipated at approximately 10:45 p.m. CDT in southeastern Noble County, northeast of Perry, many of the same areas of Logan County struck by the Mulhall tornado were hit again by an F3 tornado. However, this one was produced by a separate supercell that touched down south of Crescent at 10:56 p.m. CDT. Damage caused by this tornado was indistinguishable from damage caused by the earlier F4 tornado. 25 homes were destroyed and 30 others were damaged near Crescent, with much of the damage believed to have been caused by both tornadoes.
===Stroud, Oklahoma===

At 10:10 p.m. CDT, a damaging tornado touched down north-northeast of Sparks in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, with only sporadic tree damage occurring as it tracked north-northeast toward Davenport. Scattered damage of high-end F0 to low-end F1 intensity occurred to some homes and businesses on the southeast side of Davenport, though a house located just south of town lost more than half of its roof. As the tornado continued to track northeast, parallel with Interstate 44 and State Highway 66, Stroud took a direct hit as the storm intensified to F2 strength; the trucking terminal of the Sygma food distribution warehouse on the west side of town was destroyed with some girders and siding from the warehouse thrown northwest across State Highway 66, and the Stroud Municipal Hospital suffered significant roof damage, which resulted in significant water damage within the building. The most severe damage, consistent with an F3 tornado, occurred at the Tanger Outlet Mall at 10:39 p.m. CDT with almost all of the stores suffering roof damage at minimum, though sections of seven storefronts were destroyed and the exterior walls of the Levi&#x27;s store were collapsed inward. The mall was evacuated in advance of the tornado, resulting in no injuries or loss of life in the building. The tornado finally dissipated south of Stroud Lake at 10:50 p.m. CDT.

While there were no fatalities overall in Stroud, the economic impact of the tornado has been compared to the loss of Tinker Air Force Base, General Motors, and a major regional hospital for the Stroud region as compared to Oklahoma City at that time. Approximately 800 jobs were lost in a community of approximately 3,400 people due to the damage of the Sygma distribution warehouse and Tanger Outlet Mall, neither of which were rebuilt. Stroud&#x27;s recovery was later complicated by the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, although the town has since recovered as a result of higher oil and gas prices. Local leading industries include Service King, an oilfield manufacturing facility, and Mint Turbines, a helicopter engine reconditioning facility. Stroud is also now a downloading facility location for oil produced in the northern United States into the Cushing pipeline network.
===Other tornadoes===
The May 3 tornado event was part of a three-day event that included tornadoes in the states of Kansas, Texas and Tennessee. A deadly F4 tornado that tracked across south-central Kansas killed six people in Haysville and Wichita during the late evening of May 3. Other fatalities during the event included one person killed in Texas on May 4 by an F3 tornado that tracked from near Winfield, Texas, to southwest of Mineral Springs, Arkansas, and three people killed in Tennessee on May 5 and 6 by an F4 tornado that struck the town of Linden.
==Non-tornadic events==
Flash flooding killed one person in Camden County, Missouri, on May 4. On May 6, lightning struck and killed a man in Cobbtown, Georgia.

==Aftermath==
===Disaster assistance===
On May 3–4, the day after the initial outbreak event, President Bill Clinton signed a federal disaster declaration for eleven Oklahoma counties. In a press statement by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), then-director James Lee Witt stated that &quot;The President is deeply concerned about the tragic loss of life and destruction caused by these devastating storms.&quot; The American Red Cross opened ten shelters overnight, housing 1,600 people immediately following the disaster, decreasing to 500 people by May 5. On May 5, several emergency response and damage assessment teams from FEMA were deployed to the region. The United States Department of Defense deployed the 249th Engineering Battalion and placed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on standby for assistance. Medical and mortuary teams were also sent by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. By May 6, donation centers and phone banks were being established to create funds for victims of the tornadoes. Within the first few days of the disaster declaration, relief funds were sent to families requesting aid. Roughly $180,000 had been approved by FEMA for disaster housing assistance by May 9.

Debris removal began on May 12 as seven cleanup teams were sent to the region with more teams expected to join over the following days. That day, FEMA also granted seven Oklahoma counties (Canadian, Craig, Grady, Lincoln, Logan, Noble and Oklahoma) eligibility for federal financial assistance. Roughly $1.6 million in disaster funds had been approved for housing and business loans by May 13, increasing to more than $5.9 million over the following five days. Applications for federal aid continued through June, with state aid approvals reaching $54 million on June 3. According to FEMA, more than 9,500 Oklahoma residents applied for federal aid during the allocated period in the wake of the tornadoes, including 3,800 in Oklahoma County and 3,757 in Cleveland County. Disaster recovery aid for the tornadoes totaled to roughly $67.8 million by July 2.

===Concerns with using overpasses as storm shelters===

From a meteorological and safety standpoint, the tornado called into question the use of highway overpasses as shelters from tornadoes. Prior to the events on May 3, 1999, videos of people taking shelter in overpasses during tornadoes in the past (such as an infamous video from the April 26, 1991 tornado outbreak taken by a news crew from Wichita NBC affiliate KSNW) created public misunderstanding and complacency that overpasses provided adequate shelter from tornadoes. Although meteorologists had questioned the safety of these structures for nearly 20 years, there had been no evidence supporting incidents involving loss of life. Three overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes during the May 3 outbreak, resulting in fatalities at each location. Two occurred as a result of the Bridge Creek–Moore F5, while the third occurred in rural Payne County, which was struck by an F2 tornado. According to a study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, seeking shelter in an overpass &quot;is to become a stationary target for flying debris&quot;; the wind channeling effect that occurs within these structures along with an increase in wind speeds above ground level, changing of wind direction when the tornado vortex passes, and the fact most overpasses do not have girders for people to take shelter between also provide little to no protection.

<text>The Phobos program (, ) was an uncrewed space mission consisting of two probes launched by the Soviet Union to study Mars and its moons Phobos and Deimos. &quot;Phobos 1&quot; was launched on 7 July 1988, and &quot;Phobos 2&quot; on 12 July 1988, each aboard a Proton-K rocket.

&quot;Phobos 1&quot; suffered a terminal failure en route to Mars. &quot;Phobos 2&quot; attained Mars orbit, but contact was lost before the final phase, prior to deployment of the planned Phobos landers. &quot;Phobos 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; were of a new spacecraft design, succeeding the 4MV type used in the &quot;Venera&quot; planetary missions of 1975–1985, and the 5VK design last used during the &quot;Vega 1&quot; and &quot;Vega 2&quot; missions to Comet Halley. They each had a mass of 2600 kg (6220 kg with orbital insertion hardware attached).

The program featured cooperation from 14 other nations, including Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, France, West Germany, and the United States (which contributed the use of its NASA Deep Space Network for tracking the twin spacecraft).

==Objectives==
The objectives of the Phobos missions were to:

* conduct studies of the interplanetary environment;
* perform observations of the Sun;
* characterize the plasma environment in the Martian vicinity;
* conduct surface and atmospheric studies of Mars; and,
* study the surface composition of the Martian satellite Phobos.

==Spacecraft design==
The main section of the spacecraft consisted of a pressurized toroidal electronics section, surrounding a modular cylindrical experiment section. Below these were mounted four spherical tanks (the Fregat stage) containing hydrazine for attitude control and, after the main propulsion module was to be jettisoned, orbit adjustment. A total of 28 thrusters (twenty-four 50 N thrusters and four 10 N thrusters) were mounted on the spherical tanks, with additional thrusters mounted on the spacecraft body and solar panels. Attitude was maintained through the use of a three-axis control system, with pointing maintained with Sun and star sensors.

==Phobos 1==
&quot;Phobos 1&quot; operated nominally until, a few weeks into the cruise to Mars, an expected communications session on September 2, 1988, failed to occur. The failure of controllers to regain contact with the spacecraft was traced to an error in the software uploaded on August 29/August 30, which had deactivated the attitude thrusters. By losing its lock on the Sun, the spacecraft could no longer properly orient its solar arrays, thus depleting its batteries.

Software instructions to turn off the probe&#x27;s attitude control, normally a fatal operation, were part of a routine used when testing the spacecraft on the ground. Normally this routine would be removed before launch. However, the software was coded in PROMs, and so removing the test code would have required removing and replacing the entire computer. Because of time pressure from the impending launch, engineers decided to leave the command sequence in, though it should never be used. However, a single-character error in constructing an upload sequence resulted in the command executing, with subsequent loss of the spacecraft.

==Phobos 2==

&quot;Phobos 2&quot; was launched atop a Proton-K with a Blok D upper stage from Baikonur cosmodrome on July 12, 1988, and entered Mars orbit on January 29, 1989. &quot;Phobos 2&quot; operated nominally throughout its cruise and Mars orbital insertion phases on January 29, 1989, gathering data on the Sun, the interplanetary medium, Mars, and Phobos. Phobos 2 investigated Mars&#x27;s surface and atmosphere and returned 37 images of Phobos with a resolution of up to 40 meters. Communications were lost before planned deployment of a Phobos lander.

==Systems and sensors==
Phobos probes carried several instruments: solar x-ray and ultraviolet telescopes, a neutron spectrometer and the Grunt radar experiment designed to study the surface relief of Phobos.
The lander had an x-ray/alpha spectrometer to provide information on the chemical element composition of the surface of Phobos, a seismometer to determine the internal structure of Phobos, and the &quot;Razrez&quot; penetrator with temperature sensors and an accelerometer for testing the physical and mechanical properties of the surface.

The Phobos 2 infrared spectrometer (ISM) obtained 45000 spectra in the near infrared (from 0.75 to 3.2 μm) in the equatorial areas of Mars, with a spatial resolution ranging from 7 to 25 km, and 400 spectra of Phobos at 700 m resolution. These observations made it possible to retrieve the first mineralogical maps of the planet and its satellite, and to study the atmosphere of Mars. ISM was developed at IAS and DESPA (Paris Observatory) with support from CNES.

<text>Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit (, paperback ) is a 1992 book written by Al Gore, published in June 1992, shortly before he was elected Vice President in the 1992 presidential election. Known by the short title &quot;Earth in the Balance&quot;, the book explains the world&#x27;s ecological predicament and describes a range of policies to deal with the most pressing problems. It includes a proposed &quot;Global Marshall Plan&quot; to address current ecological issues.

Written while his son was recovering from a serious accident, &quot;Earth in the Balance&quot; became the first book written by a sitting U.S. Senator to make the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list since John F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1956 &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;.

In 1993, &quot;Earth in the Balance&quot; was released in paperback and audiobook format on audio cassette tape.

It received the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights 1993 Book award given annually to a book that &quot;most faithfully and forcefully reflects Robert Kennedy&#x27;s purposes - his concern for the poor and the powerless, his struggle for honest and even-handed justice, his conviction that a decent society must assure all young people a fair chance, and his faith that a free democracy can act to remedy disparities of power and opportunity.&quot;

The book was followed by &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;, a book that was the companion for a movie
narrated by Al Gore, shown at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and released on 24 May 2006.

In the 2002 &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Crimes of the Hot&quot;, Al Gore himself references the book and its &quot;far more popular&quot; fictional future sequel, &quot;Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth&quot;.

==Global Marshall Plan==
The Global Marshall Plan is a plan first devised by former American Vice-President Al Gore in his bestselling book &quot;Earth in the Balance&quot;, which gives specific ideas on how to save the global environment. 

Gore states: &quot;The model of the Marshall Plan can be of great help. For example, a Global Marshall Plan must focus on strategic goals and emphasize actions and programs that are likely to remove the bottlenecks presently inhibiting the healthy functioning of the global economy. The new global economy must be an inclusive system that does not leave entire regions behind. The new plan will require the wealthy nations to allocate money for transferring environmentally helpful technologies to the Third World and to help impoverished nations achieve a stable population and a new pattern of sustainable economic progress. To work, however, any such effort will also require wealthy nations to make a transition themselves that will be in some ways more wrenching than that of the Third World.&quot;

Global Marshall Plan: Five strategic goals 
&quot;In my view, five strategic goals must direct and inform our efforts to save the global environment&quot;:

* stabilizing of world population
* the rapid development of environmentally appropriate technologies
* a comprehensive change in the economic &quot;rules of the road&quot; by which we measure the impact of our decisions on the environment
* negotiation &amp; approval of a new generation of international agreements
* a cooperative plan for educating the world&#x27;s citizens about our global environment.

The idea is based on the post-WWII Marshall Plan that saw the United States send billions of dollars to European nations to rebuild their war shattered economies.

In order to further the idea of a GMP and to coordinate the various initiatives, NGOs, scientists, activists and groups in the field of development cooperation and global social justice the Global Marshall Plan Initiative was founded by members of the Club of Rome, the Club of Budapest, the Eco-Social Forum Europe, ATTAC and other organisations in Frankfurt, Germany in 2003. The two main objectives are to find new ways and sources of financing in development cooperation, predominantly pursuing the Millennium Development Goals of the UN and the worldwide propagation of the eco-social market economy, which is considered to be one of today&#x27;s key strategies of initiative. 

==Opposition to adaptation==
In the book Gore expresses opposition to adaptation to global warming, writing that adaptation represented a “kind of laziness, an arrogant faith in our ability to react in time to save our skins”.

<text>In Western music and music theory, diminution (from Medieval Latin &quot;diminutio&quot;, alteration of Latin &quot;deminutio&quot;, decrease) has four distinct meanings. Diminution may be a form of embellishment in which a long note is divided into a series of shorter, usually melodic, values (also called &quot;coloration&quot;; Ger. &quot;Kolorieren&quot;). Diminution may also be the compositional device where a melody, theme or motif is presented in shorter note-values than were previously used. Diminution is also the term for the proportional shortening of the value of individual note-shapes in mensural notation, either by coloration or by a sign of proportion. A minor or perfect interval that is narrowed by a chromatic semitone is a diminished interval, and the process may be referred to as diminution (this, too, was sometimes referred to as &quot;coloration&quot;).

== Diminution as embellishment ==
Diminution is a form of embellishment or melodic variation in which a long note or a series of long notes is divided into shorter, usually melodic, values, as in the similar practices of &quot;breaking&quot; or &quot;division&quot; in England, &quot;passaggio&quot; in Italy, &quot;double&quot; in France and &quot;glosas&quot; or &quot;diferencias&quot; in Spain. It is thoroughly documented in written sources of the sixteenth, seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, and enjoyed a remarkable flowering in Venice from about 1580–1620. It is an integral aspect of modern performance practice; Donington describes the consequences of failing to add &quot;necessary figuration&quot; as &quot;disastrous&quot;.

===Dutch literature===
*Jacob van Eyck, &quot;Der Fluyten Lust-hof&quot; (Amsterdam, 1646) is a huge collection of diminutions.

For Heinrich Schenker, &quot;all foreground is diminution&quot;. &quot;All diminution must be secured firmly to the total work by means which are precisely demonstrable and organically verified by the inner necessities of the voice-leading&quot;. This conception has been essential to Schenker&#x27;s theory from some of his earliest writings. In Schenkerian analysis a diminution is an elaboration by which an event formed of notes of longer value is expressed in notes of smaller value. See nonchord tone.

== Diminution in composition ==

A melody or series of notes is diminished if the lengths of the notes are shortened; diminution is thus the opposite of augmentation, where the notes are lengthened. A melody originally consisting of four crotchets (quarter-notes) for example, is diminished if it later appears with four quavers (eighth-notes) instead. In the following theme from Beethoven&#x27;s Leonora no. 3 Overture, the melodic ideas in bars 3 and 5 recur at twice the speed in bars 7–8: This technique is often used in contrapuntal music, as in the &quot;canon by diminution&quot; (&quot;per diminutionem&quot;), in which the notes in the following voice or voices are shorter than those in the leading voice, usually half the length. In jazz, Thelonious Monk&#x27;s composition &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot; consists of a theme that is repeated at twice the speed, an effect known as &quot;double time.&quot;

== Diminution of note values ==

In mensural notation, diminution of the duration of note shapes is the most common function of coloration. Diminution is most often by one-third of the note-value, so that three colored notes fit into the time of two uncolored notes of the same shape; it is thus often found in notation of triplet or hemiola figures.

Diminution may also be achieved by a sign of proportion. Thus a sign such as is in proportional notation not a modern time signature, but a proportional signature indicating &quot;diminutio sesquialtera&quot;, that is, that after the sign each three notes of the basic note value &quot;integer valor&quot; occupy the time of two such notes elsewhere in the piece, either previously in the same voice, or simultaneously in another voice.

== Diminution of intervals ==

A diminished interval is an interval obtained from a minor interval or perfect interval by narrowing it by a chromatic semitone, meaning that the interval is narrowed by a semitone, but the staff positions are not changed (only an accidental is changed); the process may occasionally be referred to as diminution For example, a diminished sixth is a chromatic semitone narrower than the minor sixth: starting with the interval from B to G, which is a minor sixth, eight semitones wide, the interval from B to G is a diminished sixth, spanning seven semitones, but the same staff lines. By contrast, the interval from B to F is not a diminished sixth (it is a perfect fifth): even though it is seven semitones wide, it spans five staff positions, and is thus a fifth, not a sixth; it is a diatonic semitone narrower than a minor sixth. The standard abbreviations for diminished intervals are dX, such that a diminished third = d3. The diminished fifth (d5) is the only diminished interval that appears in diatonic scales (in D major it occurs between C and G).





===Diminished chords===

A diminished triad consists of two superposed minor thirds, and thus contains a diminished fifth. In classical repertoire the usual symbol is the degree, , as in vii. In lead sheets and popular music books it is usually written Cdim or C.
A diminished seventh chord consists of three superposed minor thirds, and thus has all successive notes a minor third apart; it contains two diminished fifths. In jazz theory, a diminished seventh chord has four available tensions, each a major ninth above the chord tones, and thus forming a diminished seventh chord a whole tone (or major ninth) above the root chord. Because any chord tone of the diminished seventh can be heard as the root, the tensions are not numbered as ninth, eleventh and so on. The usual notation is Cdim7 or C7, but some lead sheets or popular music books may omit the 7.
A diminished triad with a minor seventh is a half-diminished chord, usually notated either Cm7(5) or Cø7. A diminished triad played over a root a major third away creates a Dominant 7th chord, notated C7, with a C Major triad on the bottom, and an E° from the chord third of C (C E G B). A minor third below would give a fully diminished 7th chord which is made entirely of minor thirds that evenly divide an octave. This even division of the octave leaves us with only three unique diminished 7th chords: C E G B, C E G B, and D F A C, as all other diminished 7th chords are inversions of one of those three.

===Diminished scales===

Several scales may be referred to as diminished. One of the more common is the Octatonic scale constructed from C7 and its tensions (transposed into the same octave), which has alternating tone and semitone intervals.

<doc id="418670" wikidata="Q1925344" url="?curid=418670" title="Radnage">
<text>Radnage is a village and civil parish in the Buckinghamshire district of Buckinghamshire, England. It is in the Chiltern Hills about two miles north east of Stokenchurch and six miles WNW of High Wycombe.

The parish is set in folds of the Chiltern Hills to the south of Bledlow Ridge next to the border with Oxfordshire. Although not a large parish, the residential areas known as The City, Bennett End and Town End, are separate hamlets.

Radnage (also spelled Radeneach, Rodenache etc. in old documents) meant ‘red oak’ in Old English.

==History==

Settlement in the area dates back to Roman times as demonstrated by the excavation of a Romano-British glass ribbed bowl from the village, now in the British Museum. Radnage is not mentioned in Domesday Book and it appears from a 13th-century document to have been royal demesne attached to the manor of Brill. Later, it was divided into two parts. The smaller part was granted by King Henry I to the newly established Fontevrault Abbey in France and attached to property at Leighton in Bedfordshire, which was also given to Fontevrault.

The larger part, known as Radnage Manor, was for a time retained by the crown and then in 1215 was granted by King John to the Knights Templar. When this order was suppressed in the early 14th century, their lands passed to the Knights Hospitaller. On the Dissolution of the Monasteries by King Henry VIII the manor was again acquired by the crown. King Charles I mortgaged it with other crown lands to the City of London in order to raise money. Later, King Charles II was said to have given it to one of his mistresses. But by the 19th century both parts of the manor again belonged to the crown and so remained until the abolition of manorial rights in 1925.

Dedicated on 1 May 1920, Radnage War Memorial sits in a walled garden at Mudds Bank.

== Amenities ==
Radnage has two public houses: The Crown and the Mash Inn (previously known as the Three Horseshoes).

There is also a village hall, which is used as the meeting place for the parish council and W.I. In addition to this, the hall also has a playing field and separate children&#x27;s playground.

The village also has two campsites: Bella Vista and Home Farm.

== Outdoor activities ==
Radnage is situated in the heart of the Chiltern Hills and is served by multiple footpaths and bridleways. As such, it&#x27;s popular with cyclists, walkers, runners and horse riders. The village holds an annual 5k and 10k trail run race to raise money for the local school.

=== Notable trails and locations ===

* Yoesden Nature Reserve, a chalk grassland bank with rare butterflies and wildflowers.
* Bottom Wood, a 35-acre ancient woodland and nature reserve
* Chiltern Way, 134 mile (215 km) walking loop through the Chilterns passes through the village 
* Chilterns Cycle Way, 170 mile (273.5 km) circular route of the Chilterns AONB passes through the village

==Church of St Mary the Virgin==
St Mary the Virgin is the local parish church, situated towards the northeastern edge of the parish. The church is part of the West Wycombe benefice, the building is Grade 1 listed.

=== History and construction ===
The church was built in the late 12th century, early 13th century in much the same form as it appears today, though larger windows were inserted in the 14th century and the nave appears to have been lengthened and heightened in the 15th century, when the present roof was built. There is a central tower, which is unusual in being narrower than either the chancel or the nave.

There are three original lancet windows of the early 13th century in the east wall of the chancel. The other windows in the church are 14th century. The south doorway is original of the early 13th century. A similar north doorway has been blocked up. The south porch and outer door are original of the 13th century, but with a 15th-century roof and 15th-century windows in the side walls.

The fine 15th-century nave roof has embattled tie-beams supported by arched brackets with tracery in the spandrels and also in the triangular spaces above the beams. The lower-pitched chancel roof is probably 16th century.

Inside the church there is an archway through the tower with 13th-century arches in pointed style at either end. The chancel has a 13th-century piscina (damaged) in the south wall. The nave has traces of early wall painting and also post-Reformation texts (16th-to-18th-century). The font is probably 17th-century.

<doc id="418690" wikidata="Q2867848" url="?curid=418690" title="New Brunswick Liberal Association">
<text>The New Brunswick Liberal Association (), more popularly known as the New Brunswick Liberal Party or Liberal Party of New Brunswick, is one of the two major provincial political parties in New Brunswick, Canada. The party descended from both the Confederation Party and the Anti-Confederation Party whose members split into left-wing and right-wing groups following the creation of Canada as a nation in 1867. It is the current governing party in the province, led by premier Susan Holt.

The current political organization emerged in the 1880s to serve as an organization housing the supporters of Premier Andrew G. Blair and, later, federal Liberal Party of Canada leader Wilfrid Laurier.

Today, the New Brunswick Liberal Party follows the centre-left tradition. They compete with the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick to form the government. The Green Party of New Brunswick is the only other party that has seats in the legislature. The New Brunswick New Democratic Party is not currently represented in the legislature.

Like its counterparts in the Atlantic Canadian provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, the New Brunswick Liberal Association serves both as the provincial chapter of the federal Liberal Party of Canada and as the provincial party. While its leader acts only in the provincial capacity, the party executive organizes for both provincial and federal election campaigns.

==History==

===Early years and Andrew Blair===

Prior to Canadian confederation, advocates of responsible government ran under the labels &quot;Reform&quot; or &quot;Liberal&quot;, while opponents of responsible government were known as &quot;Conservatives&quot;. With the debates over confederation in the 1860s, the party lines which had emerged blurred as Reformers split along pro and anti-Confederation lines, resulting in Confederation and Anti-Confederation Parties.

Following 1867, supporters of Confederation generally became known as Liberal-Conservatives, or just Conservatives. Those who had been against confederation regrouped loosely as &quot;Liberals&quot;, but did not become a coherent party until Andrew Blair, a supporter of Confederation, became Premier of New Brunswick and forged members of his parliamentary government and their supporters into the New Brunswick Liberal Association in 1883.

Blair led a very successful government and served as the Premier of New Brunswick for 13 years. He was New Brunswick&#x27;s longest serving premier until his tenure was surpassed by Richard Hatfield nearly a century later.

Though Blair had not been a candidate in the 1896 federal election, he joined the federal cabinet of Sir Wilfrid Laurier shortly thereafter when Laurier approached a number of Liberal premiers to join his government and address its lack of experience. This move was not expected by the party and, although it remained in government for 12 more years, it went through a rapid succession of leaders.

===Early 1900s===
After Blair abruptly left the province to join Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s cabinet in 1896, the Liberals had a leadership vacuum. James Mitchell, who had been provincial secretary, served briefly as Premier, but Mitchell soon resigned the post due to ill health. Mitchell was replaced by Henry Emmerson, who showed some promise but lost the confidence of the house when he tried to introduce women&#x27;s suffrage in 1900.

The party was saved electoral disaster when Lemuel J. Tweedie, a federal Conservative, replaced Emmerson, and won two large majorities at general elections. Though women&#x27;s suffrage could not be introduced in the province, he admitted women into the practice of law in 1906, and began the first major hydroelectric project in New Brunswick at Grand Falls. Tweedie unexpectedly accepted the appointment of Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick in 1907, and the Liberals soon found themselves again in a leadership vacuum. William Pugsley became leader and premier, but left the post after a few months to join the Laurier&#x27;s government in Ottawa. His replacement, Clifford W. Robinson was able but the electorate grew weary of the ever-changing face at head of their government, and the Conservatives swept to power in 1908.
The Conservatives were an easy choice for many New Brunswickers in the 1908 provincial election as they had been led since 1899 by John Douglas Hazen, a man with whom they had become familiar. Hazen served only briefly, leaving in 1911 to join the federal cabinet of Robert Borden, and was replaced by the charismatic and popular James Kidd Flemming. The Liberals were easily defeated by Flemming in the 1912 election, however, after Flemming was forced to resign in 1914 over a fundraising scandal, the Liberals seemed on track to return to government. This likelihood was reinforced by the lackluster administration of George Johnson Clarke who was in ill health throughout his term. The Liberals were victorious in the 1917 provincial election.

===Dysart and McNair===
In the midst of the depression, the Liberals made a resurgence in 1935 with Allison Dysart becoming premier. McNair was Dysart&#x27;s right hand, serving as Attorney General until replacing him as premier in 1940. McNair served until 1952 when he was defeated by Hugh John Flemming.

===Louis J. Robichaud===
During the 1960s, the Liberals under Louis Joseph Robichaud were instrumental in bringing Acadians into the mainstream of life in New Brunswick, declaring the province to be officially bilingual. The English and French languages were given equal status. Robichaud&#x27;s government modernized the province&#x27;s hospitals and public schools and introduced a wide range of social reforms. The Liberals also passed an act in 1969 making New Brunswick officially bilingual. &quot;Language rights&quot;, he said when he introduced the legislation, &quot;are more than legal rights. They are precious cultural rights, going deep into the revered past and touching the historic traditions of all our people.&quot;

Robichaud also restructured the municipal tax regime, ending the ability of business to play one municipality against another in order to extract the lowest tax rates. He introduced in 1963 the Municipal Capital Borrowing Act and Board, which is designed to act as a brake for spendthrift municipalities. He also expanded the government and sought to ensure that the quality of health care, education and social services was the same across the province—a programme he called Equal Opportunity, which is still a political buzz phrase in New Brunswick. &quot;When I first realized that there was absolutely no equal opportunity, no equality, in New Brunswick,&quot; he recalled in the 1980s, &quot;well, I had to come to the conclusion that something had to be done immediately.&quot;

===Opposition in the Hatfield years===
Following defeat in the 1970 election, the Liberals were largely in disarray. The party&#x27;s prospects in the 1978 election were good, but it changed leaders on the eve of the election, and, under Joseph Daigle was defeated narrowly by the Progressive Conservatives. The PCs won 30 seats in the Legislative Assembly to the Liberals&#x27; 28. The party was reduced to 18 seats in 1982 under new leader Doug Young.

===Frank McKenna===
In 1985, the party chose Frank McKenna as leader. McKenna, a young lawyer representing Chatham in the legislature in his first term, ran as the underdog candidate in a leadership campaign against party stalwart Ray Frenette. Frenette had served as interim leader from the disastrous 1982 election until the eve of the 1985 leadership race. McKenna won by significant margin.

McKenna immediately set out to prepare the party for returning to government after 15 years in opposition. The momentum was on the side of the Liberals and it seemed inevitable that McKenna would be premier as soon as an election was held. Few expected, though, that the Liberals would sweep the province, winning every seat—the second time this had happened in Canadian history (the first time was in the Prince Edward Island provincial election of 1935).

McKenna was regarded as a fiscal conservative and was called by some the &quot;Best Tory Premier New Brunswick never had&quot;. Despite this, McKenna was a progressive on many issues. He made considerable cuts to social programs because of the province&#x27;s dire fiscal situation and cuts to federal equalization payments and other transfers. He also instituted new programs. Notably, McKenna instituted a publicly funded kindergarten program—something that had been promised by the Hatfield-led Progressive Conservatives in the previous four elections. McKenna also launched a home care program called &quot;Extramural Nursing&quot; which has been hailed as the best in Canada. In the 2002 Romanow report on the Future of Healthcare in Canada, New Brunswick&#x27;s system was specifically cited as a model for homecare in Canada.

Despite riding high in the polls, McKenna resigned on October 13, 1997, ten years (to the day) since his first election as premier, fulfilling a promise to serve for only ten years.

McKenna was replaced by Frenette, who had served as his right-hand in the legislature throughout his term. Frenette served as premier for the following seven months while the party chose a new leader. Frenette was replaced by Camille Thériault who served as premier until the 1999 election.

In the 1999 election, the Liberals suffered their worst ever defeat, winning only 10 seats despite having begun the campaign with a double-digit lead in opinion polls. The by-election losses were a further blow to Camille Thériault&#x27;s leadership, and he resigned from the party leadership and the legislature on March 21, 2001. Bernard Richard, who had finished third in the leadership contest against Thériault in 1998, became interim leader.

In 2000, Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Bernard Thériault resigned to make an unsuccessful bid for the House of Commons of Canada in Acadie-Bathurst, and Edmond Blanchard resigned to accept an appointment to the Federal Court of Canada. The Progressive Conservatives won both of these seats in by-elections in early 2001, reducing the Liberals to eight seats in the legislature.

===Shawn Graham===

In the following leadership contest, many candidates appeared briefly but withdrew. Early candidates included former cabinet minister Paul Duffie, former McKenna adviser Francis McGuire, and Moncton lawyer Mike Murphy. McGuire, after briefly considering a bid, declined. Murphy began the formative stages of a campaign, but abruptly withdrew, surprising many of his supporters. This left Duffie largely unchallenged. The only other candidate was former party organizer Jack MacDougall who had abruptly left the party in the midst of the 1999 campaign.

Many in the party felt that Duffie, who was close to Thériault, was the wrong choice. Bernard Richard was urged to abandon the interim leadership and contest the race, and began a formative campaign before announcing he would continue as interim leader instead. After the campaign had already begun in earnest, Shawn Graham, a rookie MLA in his early 30s, announced his candidacy in January 2002. Graham took a convincing lead in delegate selection meetings. Duffie withdrew, leaving Graham to face only MacDougall whom he defeated by a 3-to-1 margin.

The party chose Shawn Graham as leader on May 12, 2002. Graham nearly won the 2003 election taking 26 of 55 seats in the New Brunswick legislature. Richard, who was re-elected in 2003, accepted a provincial appointment on November 26, 2003. This was viewed as a serious blow to Graham&#x27;s leadership.

Graham led the Liberals to a narrow victory in the 2006 provincial election winning 29 of 55 seats and losing the popular vote 47.2% to 47.5% for the Progressive Conservatives. The Liberals took power on October 3, 2006. They subsequently added three extra seats. Chris Collins captured the seat in the riding of Moncton East on March 5, 2007, which was vacated when former Premier Bernard Lord stepped down as leader of the Progressive Conservatives. Wally Stiles and his wife Joan MacAlpine Stiles, elected as Progressive Conservatives, crossed the floor to join the Liberals the following month, April 17.
On September 27, 2010, Shawn Graham lost his bid to be re-elected as Premier (13 to 42) to provincial PC leader David Alward, but remained MLA for Kent riding. He stepped down as leader of the party on November 9, 2010, and Victor Boudreau was selected as the party&#x27;s interim leader the following day. The Shawn Graham Government was the first one of the province to not get re-elected for a second term.

===Brian Gallant===
After a term in Opposition, the Liberals returned to power under Brian Gallant, winning a majority in the 2014 provincial election with Gallant being sworn in as Premier on October 7, 2014. Gallant&#x27;s first cabinet, of 13 members, was smaller than the outgoing cabinet.

During his government&#x27;s mandate the province&#x27;s economy and exports grew each year; the unemployment rate which was hovering around 10% was reduced to just over 7%; in 2016 KPMG found that three of the four most cost competitive cities in which to do business in Canada and the United States were in New Brunswick; the province&#x27;s population grew to a record high surpassing 770,000 people for the first time; one of the most vibrant cybersecurity clusters in North America was developed in New Brunswick&#x27;s capital city; and the province saw its first budget surplus in a decade.

The Gallant government increased the budget for education and early childhood development by 15% over its mandate in order to invest in literacy initiatives, introduce coding in more schools, and reintroduce trades in high schools.
The Gallant government created programs to help the middle class with the cost of childcare and to provide free childcare to families which need the most support. The Gallant government also created programs to help the middle class with the cost of tuition and to provide free tuition for those who need the most support.

The Gallant government eliminated the unconstitutional two doctor rule that was hindering a women&#x27;s right to choose for decades in New Brunswick. In 2016, New Brunswick welcomed the most Syrian refugees displaced by the humanitarian crisis per capita of all the provinces in the country.

The Gallant government also advanced women&#x27;s equality by moving pay equity forward to the point of New Brunswick having the second lowest gender wage gap of all the Canadian provinces in 2017; by having over 50% of government appointments to agencies, boards, and commissions go to women; and by providing the first gender parity on New Brunswick&#x27;s provincial court.

Gallant has repeatedly stated that climate change is the greatest challenge facing humanity. With this in mind, the Gallant government took concrete action to protect the environment including by creating the “Transitioning to a Low Carbon Economy” plan which commits to historic measures to fight climate change. The Gallant government also placed a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing and a ban on the disposal of fracked wastewater in municipal systems.

In addition to premier, Gallant has served New Brunswick as the Attorney General, the Minister responsible for innovation, the Minister responsible for women&#x27;s equality, and the Leader of Her Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition.

The 2018 provincial election resulted in Gallant&#x27;s Liberals winning only 21 seats compared to Blaine Higgs and the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick who won 22. Gallant vowed to attempt to remain in power with a minority government and hoped to retain the confidence of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick either on a vote-by-vote basis or with the agreement of the smaller parties, the Green Party of New Brunswick and the People&#x27;s Alliance of New Brunswick, each of which won three seats in the election.

===In opposition (2018–2024)===
On November 2, 2018 Gallant&#x27;s Liberal minority government was defeated by a confidence vote on its throne speech by a margin of 25 to 23 with the opposition Progressive Conservatives and People&#x27;s Alliance voting against the government and the Greens voting with the government. Gallant resigned as premier on November 2, 2018 and was replaced by Higgs, leading a Progressive Conservative minority government with support from the People&#x27;s Alliance.

Kevin Vickers was acclaimed as the new Liberal leader in April 2019. He ran in Miramichi in 2020 and lost to incumbent MLA Michelle Conroy; Conroy later crossed the floor to join the PCNB). He resigned as party leader the same day. In September 2020, Roger Melanson was named interim leader until Susan Holt was elected as party leader on August 6, 2022.

<doc id="418697" wikidata="Q6058729" url="?curid=418697" title="Intrinsic parity">
<text>In quantum mechanics, the intrinsic parity is a phase factor that arises as an eigenvalue of the parity operation formula_1 (a reflection about the origin). To see that the parity&#x27;s eigenvalues are phase factors, we assume an eigenstate of the parity operation (this is realized because the intrinsic parity is a property of a particle species) and use the fact that two parity transformations leave the particle in the same state, thus the new wave function can differ by only a phase factor, i.e.: formula_2 thus formula_3, since these are the only eigenstates satisfying the above equation. 

The intrinsic parity&#x27;s phase is conserved for strong and electromagnetic interactions (the product of the intrinsic parities is the same before and after the reaction), but not for weak interactions. As formula_4 the Hamiltonian is invariant under a parity transformation. The intrinsic parity of a system is the product of the intrinsic parities of the particles, for instance for noninteracting particles we have formula_5. Since the parity commutes with the Hamiltonian and formula_6 its eigenvalue does not change with time, therefore the intrinsic parities phase is a conserved quantity.

A consequence of the Dirac equation is that the intrinsic parity of fermions and antifermions obey the relation formula_7, so particles and their antiparticles have the opposite parity. Single leptons can never be created or destroyed in experiments, as lepton number is a conserved quantity. This means experiments are unable to distinguish the sign of a leptons parity, so by convention it is chosen that leptons have intrinsic parity +1, antileptons have formula_8. Similarly the parity of the quarks is chosen to be +1, and antiquarks is -1.

<doc id="418698" wikidata="Q491922" url="?curid=418698" title="Mondragón">
<text>Mondragón ( or &quot;Mondragoe&quot;), officially known as Arrasate/Mondragón, is a town and municipality in Gipuzkoa Province, Basque Country, Spain. Its population in 2015 was 21,933.

==Economic and historical significance==
The town is best known as the birthplace of the Mondragon Corporation, the world&#x27;s largest worker cooperative, whose foundation was inspired in the 1940s by the Catholic priest José María Arizmendiarrieta. In 2002 the MCC contributed 3.7% to the total GDP of the Basque Country and 7.6% to the industrial GDP.

The valley of the High Deba where the town is located enjoyed a high level of employment in the 1980s while the rest of the Basque industrial areas suffered from the steel crisis.

Noted poverty expert and sociology professor Barbara J. Peters of Stony Brook Southampton has studied the incorporated and entirely resident-owned town of Mondragón. &quot;In Mondragón, I saw no signs of poverty. I saw no signs of extreme wealth,&quot; Peters said. &quot;I saw people looking out for each other…. It&#x27;s a caring form of capitalism.&quot;

The spa at Santa Águeda (now a psychiatric hospital) was the location of the 1897 murder of Spanish monarchist politician Antonio Cánovas del Castillo by Michele Angiolillo.

==Mondragón University==
Mondragón serves as base of Mondragón University, a private university created in 1997, that is connected with the MCC companies. Almost all of the university&#x27;s graduates find their first job within three months after completing their studies due to this strong link.

Mondragón University is divided into engineering, humanities, and enterprise faculties. The faculty of engineering is in Mondragon and Goierri. The humanities faculty is in Eskoriatza and the enterprise faculty is in Bidasoa and Oñati. The student enrollment is approximately 3,500 and is rapidly growing. The majority of the students are from Gipuzkoa and surrounding villages, although in the last few years, the number of students from Bilbao, San Sebastián, and the Basque Country capital, Vitoria-Gasteiz, has increased significantly.

==Politics and government==
After the establishment of democracy, the first mayor elected in Mondragón was the nationalist José Antonio Ardanza, who served from 1979 to 1983 and later became lehendakari of the Basque government from 1985 to 1999.

==In film==
Pierre Boutron&#x27;s French language film &quot;Fiesta!&quot;, adapted from a novel written by José Luis de Vilallonga, was set in Mondragón during the Spanish Civil War.

==Archaeology==

<doc id="418701" wikidata="Q5415672" url="?curid=418701" title="Evangelical Covenant Church">
<text>The Evangelical Covenant Church (ECC) is an evangelical denomination with Pietist Lutheran roots. The denomination has 129,015 members in 878 congregations and an average worship attendance of 219,000 people in the United States and Canada with ministries on five continents. 

==Background==
The Evangelical Covenant Church&#x27;s background is in free-church Swedish immigrants known as Mission Friends who had broken off from the Lutheran Church of Sweden. They formed a mission society and in the 1880s, meetings were held to determine whether or not to form a union of mission churches. The majority joined together, forming the Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant of America (now ECC) on February 20, 1885, in Chicago, Illinois. A smaller percentage known as the Free Friends remained independent and became the Swedish Evangelical Free Church, now part of the Evangelical Free Church of America.

A pietistic religious awakening had swept through Sweden around the middle of the 19th century. Before leaving their homeland some Swedes met in people&#x27;s homes, as they felt the state church was becoming overly powerful. There they conducted private services (conventicles), including hymn singing accompanied by guitars, and read scripture from their Bibles, but they were sometimes interrupted by church officials, who wanted to keep them in congregations at church. The Conventicle Act, in effect until 1858, prevented them from holding private religious gatherings. This reinforced their yearning to be in a church where they could worship freely. With this awakening and reformation came the Swedish Mission Church in 1878. The state church discouraged the gathering of these believers.

People from this movement emigrated to North America, where they formed the Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant of America. Early leaders and influences included Carl August Björk (1837–1916) Paul Petter Waldenström (1838–1917) and David Nyvall (1863–1946), among others. They desired to create a voluntary &quot;covenant of churches&quot; that were committed to sharing the Gospel of Jesus, as well as provide means for ministerial training. The name was changed to the &quot;Evangelical Covenant Church of America&quot; in 1954. The &quot;of America&quot; was eventually abandoned because the denomination includes a Canadian conference.

==Status==
The denominational offices are located in Chicago, Illinois, where they are also affiliated with North Park University and North Park Theological Seminary. The church was formerly affiliated with Swedish Hospital, then known as Swedish Covenant Hospital. There are related Bible colleges in Alaska, where the church established early missions, and California. They are also affiliated with Minnehaha Academy, a pre-K-12 school in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Jesus People USA, a commune in Chicago, is affiliated with the Covenant Church.

The church is divided into eleven regional conferences – Canada Conference, Central Conference, East Coast Conference (organized 1890), Great Lakes Conference, Midsouth Conference, Midwest Conference, Pacific Northwest Conference, Northwest Conference, Pacific Southwest Conference, Southeast Conference – and its newest conference, the Alaska Conference. The Covenant presence in Alaska started from 1887 as a foreign mission outpost, but gradually transitioned its status to a home mission, and finally full conference standing in 2015.

Annual meetings are held, to which delegates are sent by the congregations, reporting back to local churches.

Covenant Publications are the communication arm of the denomination. The denominational hymnal is &quot;The Covenant Hymnal: A Worship Book&quot;.

A major ministry of the denomination includes senior living facilities and is supplemented through its Covenant Benevolent Institutions department. Among the ECC retirement systems, The Samarkand and Covenant Shores are considered to be two of the top facilities in the United States.

As of 2011, denomination membership was 124,669 in 820 congregations in the United States (43 states) of US and an estimated 1500 members in 23 congregations in Canada (five provinces). Average attendance in 2009 was 178,997. The denomination also has ongoing missions work in 25 countries worldwide, with 125 long-term missionaries, project missionaries and short-term missionaries. The ECC has a worldwide membership of almost 278,000.

Membership is concentrated primarily in three regions of the United States: the Midwest, along the West Coast, and in the Great Plains region. California has the largest number of members, but the highest rates of membership are in Minnesota, Alaska, Kansas, Nebraska, and Washington.

==Other==
Forerunners of the Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant were the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Ansgar Synod and the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Mission Synod. When members of the two synods dissolved and the Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant was formed, some of those who did not enter the Mission Covenant formed the Swedish Evangelical Free Mission (now the Evangelical Free Church of America). The Evangelical Covenant Church maintains ties with the Mission Covenant Church of Sweden (formerly known as the &quot;Svenska Missionsförbundet&quot;; see Svenska Missionskyrkan and CIPE), and the other churches in the International Federation of Free Evangelical Churches.

In the 1920s, Warner Sallman created illustrations for the denominational magazine, &quot;Covenant Companion&quot;, including his charcoal sketch &quot;The Son of Man&quot; for a 1924 magazine cover that was later redone as the famous oil painting &quot;The Head of Christ&quot;.

Since 1976, the denomination has ordained and licensed women as ministers.

Many figures in the Jesus Movement have formally linked themselves to the ECC.

In 2022, the Rev. Tammy Swanson-Draheim was elected as the first female president of the denomination.

==Stance on same-sex marriage==

The ECC officially excludes same-sex marriage from its theology and practice. The ECC&#x27;s 1996 resolution adopted by the Covenant Annual Meeting entitled &quot;Resolution on Human Sexuality&quot; represents the ongoing consensus position of the ECC. The resolution upholds &quot;celibacy, the state of abstaining (outside of marriage) in singleness, and heterosexual relations as the Christian standard&quot;. Additionally, the ECC does not permit ministers to perform same-sex marriages.

The ECC, though, has been a pioneer among evangelical denominations with regard to its commitment to engagement with the LGBT community. In 2018, the ECC launched Embrace, a suite of human sexuality discipleship resources and learning experiences which are in harmony with the adopted position of the ECC. A special emphasis of Embrace is equipping ECC churches and individuals to flourish in love for LGBT individuals and communities.

The ECC does allow ministers to exercise pastoral discretion by attending a same-sex marriage ceremony. One congregation in Portland, OR developed differing all-inclusive policy statements, prompting the ECC to remove that congregation in 2015. Moreover, some individuals affiliated with Covenant congregations have organized to advocate for more inclusive national policies.

At the June 2019 annual meeting of the ECC, First Covenant Church of Minneapolis was dismissed from the ECC&#x27;s roster of churches after being deemed out of harmony with regard to its position on human sexuality and pastoral credentialing after a vote for involuntary dismissal by delegates surpassed a two-thirds supermajority. Delegates also surpassed a two-thirds supermajority in removing the ordination standing of two pastors who contravened the ECC&#x27;s communally discerned position on human sexuality.

<doc id="418706" wikidata="Q6370170" url="?curid=418706" title="Karenna Gore">
<text>Karenna Aitcheson Gore (born August 6, 1973) is an American author, lawyer, and climate activist. She is the eldest daughter of former U.S. vice president Al Gore and Tipper Gore and the sister of Kristin Gore, Sarah Gore Maiani, and Albert Gore III. Gore is the founder and executive director of the Center for Earth Ethics at Union Theological Seminary.

==Early life==
Gore was born in Nashville, Tennessee, and grew up there as well as in Washington, D.C.

When she was 11 years old, Karenna&#x27;s mother, Tipper Gore, overheard her listening to Prince&#x27;s song &quot;Darling Nikki&quot;, which contained explicit lyrics, which inspired her mother to launch the Parents Music Resource Center, which sought to have &quot;parental warning labels affixed to record albums that contained sexually explicit lyrics, portrayed excessive violence, or glorified drugs.&quot;

Gore earned her B.A. (magna cum laude) in history and literature in 1995 from Harvard University, a J.D. from Columbia Law School in 2000, and an M.A. in social ethics from Union Theological Seminary in 2013. During college, she interned as a journalist for WREG-TV and &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot;. She later wrote for &quot;El País&quot; in Spain and &quot;Slate&quot; in Seattle.

===2000 presidential campaign and book===
Gore was the Youth Outreach Chair on her father&#x27;s 2000 presidential campaign. Together with her father&#x27;s former Harvard roommate Tommy Lee Jones, she officially nominated her father as the presidential candidate during the 2000 Democratic Convention in Los Angeles. She also introduced her father during the launching of his campaign.

In 2006, she published &quot;Lighting the Way: Nine Women Who Shaped Modern America&quot;, a profile of nine modern and historical American women. Stating that the book was written in reaction to the results of the 2000 campaign, Gore said, &quot;I wanted to turn all that frustration and sadness into something positive.&quot;

== Professional career ==
After law school, Gore worked briefly as an associate with the law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett in New York City. She left that job to work in the non-profit sector as director of community affairs for the Association to Benefit Children (ABC), and as a volunteer in the legal center of Sanctuary for Families.

After graduating from Union Theological Seminary in 2013, Gore was asked to lead the Union Forum, a platform for theological scholarship to engage with civic discourse and social change. In 2014, she organized &quot;Religions for the Earth,&quot; a conference held in conjunction with the 2014 United Nations Climate Summit. Religions for the Earth brought together more than 200 religious and spiritual leaders to redefine the climate crisis &quot;as an urgent moral imperative.&quot;

Based on the success of this conference, Gore founded the Center for Earth Ethics (CEE) at Union Theological Seminary the following year. CEE &quot;bridges the worlds of religion, academia, politics, and culture to discern and pursue the necessary changes to stop ecological destruction and create a society that values life.&quot; She is CEE&#x27;s executive director and is an ex officio faculty member of The Earth Institute at Columbia University.

She serves on the boards of the Association to Benefit Children, Pando Populus, the Sweetwater Cultural Center, and Riverkeeper. She is also an expert in the United Nations’ Harmony with Nature Knowledge Network.

=== Activism ===
Gore has been heavily involved in climate activism, both in writing and direct action, including opposition to the construction of new pipelines and other infrastructure to support the fossil fuel industry.

In 2016, Gore was part of the successful campaign against a fracked gas pipeline (the Constitution pipeline) through New York state, publishing an op-ed in the New York Times on the issue.

In June 2016, Gore was among 23 protesters who were arrested for demonstrating at the site of construction of a pipeline in Boston that would carry fracked gas for the Houston-based Spectra company. She subsequently published an opinion piece, &quot;Why I was arrested in West Roxbury,&quot; in The Boston Globe.

In 2021, on the 49th anniversary of the Clean Water Act, she published a guest essay in the Virginia Mercury in opposition to the Mountain Valley Pipeline.

==Personal life==
On July 12, 1997, she married Andrew Newman Schiff, a primary care physician in Washington, D.C., and great-great grandson of Jacob Schiff, at the Washington National Cathedral. Andrew Schiff now works as a biotechnology fund manager. They have three children together: Wyatt Gore Schiff (born July 4, 1999, in New York City), Anna Hunger Schiff (born August 23, 2001, in New York City), and Oscar Aitcheson Schiff (born in 2006). She and husband Andrew separated in 2010 and later divorced.
