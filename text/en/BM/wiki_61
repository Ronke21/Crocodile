<text>(originally written as ; Anglo-Norman French for &quot;The Death of Arthur&quot;) is a 15th-century Middle English prose reworking by Sir Thomas Malory of tales about the legendary King Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table, along with their respective folklore. In order to tell a &quot;complete&quot; story of Arthur from his conception to his death, Malory compiled, rearranged, interpreted and modified material from various French and English sources. Today, this is one of the best-known works of Arthurian literature. Many authors since the 19th-century revival of the legend have used Malory as their principal source.

Apparently written in prison at the end of the medieval English era, &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; was completed by Malory around 1470 and was first published in a printed edition in 1485 by William Caxton. Until the discovery of the Winchester Manuscript in 1934, the 1485 edition was considered the earliest known text of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; and that closest to Malory&#x27;s original version. Modern editions under myriad titles are inevitably variable, changing spelling, grammar and pronouns for the convenience of readers of modern English, as well as often abridging or revising the material.

==History==
===Authorship===
The exact identity of the author of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; has long been the subject of speculation, as at least six historical figures bore the name of &quot;Sir Thomas Malory&quot; (in various spellings) during the late 15th century. In the work, the author describes himself as &quot;Knyght presoner Thomas Malleorre&quot; (&quot;Sir Thomas Maleore&quot; according to the publisher William Caxton). Historically, this has been taken as supporting evidence for the identification most widely accepted by scholars: that the author was Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel, Warwickshire, son of Sir John Malory.

According to the timeline proposed by P.J.C. Field, Sir Thomas of Newbold Revel inherited the family estate in 1434, but by 1450 he was fully engaged in a life of crime. As early as 1433, he had been accused of theft, but the more serious allegations against him included that of the attempted murder of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, an accusation of at least two rapes, and that he had attacked and robbed Coombe Abbey. Malory was first arrested and imprisoned in 1451 for the ambush of Buckingham, but was released early in 1452. By March, he was back in the Marshalsea prison and then in Colchester, escaping on multiple occasions. In 1461, he was granted a pardon by King Henry VI, returning to live at his estate. After 1461, however, few records survive which scholars agree refer to Malory of Newbold Revel. In 1468–1470, King Edward IV issued four more general pardons which specifically excluded a Thomas Malory. The first of these named Malory a knight and applied to participants in a campaign in Northumberland in the North of England by members of the Lancastrian faction. Field interprets these pardon-exclusions to refer to Malory of Newbold Revel, suggesting that Malory changed his allegiance from York to Lancaster, and that he was involved in a conspiracy with Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick to overthrow King Edward. William Matthews, having given evidence of this candidate&#x27;s advanced age at the time of the Northumberland campaign and living much further to the South, interprets this record as referring to his own proposed candidate for authorship. Field proposed that it was during a final stint at Newgate Prison in London that he wrote &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, and that Malory was released in October 1470 when Henry VI returned to the throne, dying only five months later. This Warwickshire knight was widely accepted as the author of the &quot;Morte&quot; until the publication of Matthews&#x27; research in 1966.

This identification was widely accepted through most of the 20th century based on the assumption that this candidate was born around 1416. The 1416 date was proposed by Field, contradicting the original record of this knight&#x27;s military service record by Dugdale. In 1966, Matthews published original research demonstrating that Malory of Newbold Revel had in fact been an officer under King Henry V in the famous Agincourt campaign by 1414 or 1415; confirming Dugdale&#x27;s original record and placing this knight&#x27;s birth around 1393. Some late 20th-century researchers cast a doubt that this would make the Newbold Revel knight far too old to have written &quot;Le Morte&quot;: in prison in his mid-70s to early 80s, when, in Matthews&#x27; words, &quot;the medieval view was that by sixty a man was bean fodder and forage, ready for nothing but death&#x27;s pit.&quot; Because no other contemporary Thomas Malory had been shown to have been knighted, the question remained unresolved.

The second candidate to receive scholarly support as the possible author of &quot;Le Morte Darthur&quot; is Thomas Mallory of Papworth St Agnes in Huntingdonshire, whose will, written in Latin and dated 16 September 1469, was described in an article by T. A. Martin in the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; magazine in September 1897. This Mallory was born in Shropshire in 1425, the son of Sir William Mallory, although there is no indication in the will that he was himself a knight; he died within six weeks of the will being made. It has been suggested that the fact that he appears to have been brought up in Lincolnshire may account for the traces of Lincolnshire dialect in &quot;Le Morte Darthur&quot;. To date, this candidate has not commanded the attention of scholars as the Newbold-Revel knight has.

The most recent contender for authorship emerged in the mid-20th century: Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers and Studley Royal in Yorkshire. This claim was put forward in 1966 in &quot;The Ill-Framed Knight: A Skeptical Inquiry into the Identity of Sir Thomas Malory&quot; by William Matthews. Matthews&#x27; primary arguments in favor of the Yorkshire Malory were the northerly dialect of the &quot;Morte&quot;; the likelihood that this is the Malory who was excluded from the pardon by Edward IV in 1468; and the fact that the Newbold Revel knight was far too old to be writing the &quot;Morte&quot; in the late 1460s. Matthews&#x27; interpretation was not widely accepted, primarily because he could not find evidence that the Yorkshireman was a knight. Cecelia Lampp Linton, however, has provided extensive detail about the Malorys of Yorkshire and offered evidence that Thomas of Yorkshire was a Knight Hospitaller, a militant of the Catholic Church. She has also examined the provenance of some of the known sources of the &quot;Morte&quot; and has demonstrated that this Malory would have had ready access to these documents. Accepting Linton&#x27;s evidence would remove the primary objection to his authorship, making the contradictions presented by the Newbold Revel knight irrelevant. The &quot;Morte&quot; itself seems to be much more the work of a knight of the church than a secular repeat offender, as evidenced by Malory&#x27;s own conclusion (rendered in Modern English): &quot;... pray for me while I am in life that God send me good deliverance, and when I am dead I pray you all pray for my soul; for this book was ended the ninth year of the reign of King Edward the Fourth by Sir Thomas Maleore, knight, as Jesus help him by his great might, as he is the servant of Jesus both day and night.&quot;

===Sources===
As Elizabeth Bryan wrote of Malory&#x27;s contribution to Arthurian legend in her introduction to a modern edition of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, &quot;Malory did not invent the stories in this collection; he translated and compiled them. Malory in fact translated Arthurian stories that already existed in 13th-century French prose (the so-called Old French Vulgate romances) and compiled them together with Middle English sources (the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot; and the Stanzaic &quot;Morte Arthur&quot;) to create this text.&quot;

Within his narration, Malory refers to drawing it from a singular &quot;Freynshe booke&quot;, in addition to also unspecified &quot;other bookis&quot;. In addition to the vast Vulgate Cycle in its different variants, as well as the English poems &quot;Morte Arthur&quot; and &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;, Malory&#x27;s other original source texts were identified as several French standalone chivalric romances, including &quot;Érec et Énide&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;âtre périlleux&quot;, &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;, and &quot;Yvain ou le Chevalier au Lion&quot; (or its English version, &quot;Ywain and Gawain&quot;), as well as John Hardyng&#x27;s English &quot;Chronicle&quot;. The English poem &quot;The Weddynge of Syr Gawen&quot; is uncertainly regarded as either just another of these or possibly actually Malory&#x27;s own work. His assorted other sources might have included a 5th-century Roman military manual, &quot;De re militari&quot;.

===Publication and impact===
&quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; was completed in 1469 or 1470 (&quot;the ninth year of the reign of King Edward IV&quot;), according to a note at the end of the book. It is believed that Malory&#x27;s original title intended was to be &quot;The hoole booke of kyng Arthur &amp; of his noble knyghtes of the rounde table&quot;, and only its final section to be named &quot;Le Morte Darthur&quot;. At the end of the work, Caxton added: &quot;Thus endeth this noble &amp; joyous book entytled le morte Darthur, Notwythstondyng it treateth of the byrth, lyf, and actes of the sayd kynge Arthur; of his noble knyghtes of the rounde table, theyr meruayllous enquestes and aduentures, thachyeuyng of the sangreal, &amp; in thende the dolorous deth &amp; departynge out of this worlde of them al.&quot; Caxton separated Malory&#x27;s eight books into 21 books, subdivided the books into a total of 506 chapters, and added a summary of each chapter as well as a colophon to the entire book. In his preface, Caxton also discussed the subject of the historicity of King Arthur.

The first printing of Malory&#x27;s work was made by Caxton in 1485, becoming one of the first books to be ever printed in England. Only two copies of this original printing are known to exist, in the collections of the Morgan Library &amp; Museum in New York and the John Rylands Library in Manchester. It proved popular and was reprinted in an illustrated form with some additions and changes in 1498 (&quot;The Boke of Kyng Arthur Somtyme Kynge of Englande and His Noble Actes and Feates of Armes of Chyvalrye&quot;) and 1529 (&quot;The Boke of the Moost Noble and Worthy Prince Kyng Arthur Somtyme Kyng of Grete Brytayne Now Called Englande&quot;) by Wynkyn de Worde who succeeded to Caxton&#x27;s press. Three more editions were published before the English Civil War: William Copland&#x27;s &quot;The Story of the Most Noble and Worthy Kynge Arthur&quot; (1557), Thomas East&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Kynge Arthur, and also of his Knyghtes of the Rounde Table&quot; (1585), and William Stansby&#x27;s &quot;The Most Ancient and Famous History of the Renowned Prince Arthur King of Britaine&quot; (1634), each of which contained additional changes and errors. Stansby&#x27;s edition, based on East&#x27;s, was also deliberately censored. Thereafter, the book went out of fashion until the Romanticist revival of interest in all things medieval.

The British Library summarizes the importance of Malory&#x27;s work thus: &quot;It was probably always a popular work: it was first printed by William Caxton (...) and has been read by generations of readers ever since. In a literary sense, Malory&#x27;s text is the most important of all the treatments of Arthurian legend in English language, influencing writers as diverse as Edmund Spenser, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Mark Twain and John Steinbeck.&quot;

===The Winchester Manuscript===
An assistant headmaster at Winchester College, Walter Fraser Oakeshott discovered a previously unknown manuscript copy of the work in June 1934, during the cataloguing of the college&#x27;s library. Newspaper accounts announced that what Caxton had published in 1485 was not exactly what Malory had written. Oakeshott published &quot;The Finding of the Manuscript&quot; in 1963, chronicling the initial event and his realization that &quot;this indeed was Malory,&quot; with &quot;startling evidence of revision&quot; in the Caxton edition. This manuscript is now in the British Library&#x27;s collection.

Malory scholar Eugène Vinaver examined the manuscript shortly after its discovery. Oakeshott was encouraged to produce an edition himself, but he ceded the project to Vinaver. Based on his initial study of the manuscript, Oakeshott concluded in 1935 that the copy from which Caxton printed his edition &quot;was already subdivided into books and sections.&quot; Vinaver made an exhaustive comparison of the manuscript with Caxton&#x27;s edition and reached similar conclusions. Microscopic examination revealed that ink smudges on the Winchester manuscript are offsets of newly printed pages set in Caxton&#x27;s own font, which indicates that the Winchester Manuscript was in Caxton&#x27;s print shop. The manuscript is believed to be closer on the whole to Malory&#x27;s original and does not have the book and chapter divisions for which Caxton takes credit in his preface. It has been digitised by a Japanese team, who note that &quot;the text is imperfect, as the manuscript lacks the first and last quires and few leaves. The most striking feature of the manuscript is the extensive use of red ink.&quot;

In his 1947 publication of &quot;The Works of Sir Thomas Malory&quot;, Vinaver argued that Malory wrote not a single book, but rather a series of Arthurian tales, each of which is an internally consistent and independent work. However, William Matthews pointed out that Malory&#x27;s later tales make frequent references to the earlier events, suggesting that he had wanted the tales to cohere better but had not sufficiently revised the whole text to achieve this. This was followed by much debate in the late 20th-century academia over which version is superior, Caxton&#x27;s print or Malory&#x27;s original vision.

Caxton&#x27;s edition differs from the Winchester manuscript in many places. As well as numerous small differences on every page, there is also a major difference both in style and content in Malory&#x27;s Book II (Caxton&#x27;s Book V), describing the war with the Emperor Lucius, where Caxton&#x27;s version is much shorter. In addition, the Winchester manuscript has none of the customary marks indicating to the compositor where chapter headings and so on were to be added. It has therefore been argued that the Winchester manuscript was not the copy from which Caxton prepared his edition; rather it seems that Caxton either wrote out a different version himself for the use of his compositor, or used another version prepared by Malory.

The Winchester manuscript does not appear to have been copied out by Malory himself; rather, it seems to have been a presentation copy made by two scribes who, judging from certain dialect forms which they introduced into the text, appear to have come from West Northamptonshire. Apart from these forms, both the Winchester manuscript and the Caxton edition show some more northerly dialect forms which, in the judgement of the Middle English dialect expert Angus McIntosh are closest to the dialect of Lincolnshire. McIntosh argues, however, that this does not necessarily rule out the Warwickshire Malory as the possible author; he points out that it could be that the Warwickshire Malory consciously imitated the style and vocabulary of romance literature typical of the period.

==Content overview==
===Setting and themes===
Most of the events take place in a historical fantasy version of Britain and France at an unspecified time (on occasion, the plot ventures farther afield, to Rome and Sarras, and recalls Biblical tales from the ancient Near East). Arthurian myth is set during the 5th to 6th centuries; however, Malory&#x27;s telling contains many anachronisms and makes no effort at historical accuracyeven more so than his sources. Earlier romance authors have already depicted the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; times of Arthur as a familiar, High-to-Late Medieval style world of armored knights and grand castles taking place of the Post-Roman warriors and forts. Malory further modernized the legend by conflating the Celtic Britain with his own contemporary Kingdom of England (for example explicitly identifying Logres as England, Camelot as Winchester, and Astolat as Guildford) and, completely ahistorically, replacing the legend&#x27;s Saxon invaders with the Ottoman Turks in the role of King Arthur&#x27;s foreign pagan enemies. Malory hearkens back to an age of knighthood, with chivalric codes of honour and jousting tournaments, and as noted by Ian Scott-Kilvert, characters which &quot;consist almost entirely of fighting men, their wives or mistresses, with an occasional clerk or an enchanter, a fairy or a fiend, a giant or a dwarf,&quot; and &quot;time does not work on the heroes of Malory.&quot;

According to Charles W. Moorman III, Malory intended &quot;to set down in English a unified Arthuriad which should have as its great theme the birth, the flowering, and the decline of an almost perfect earthy civilization.&quot; Moorman identified three main motifs going through the work: Sir Lancelot&#x27;s and Queen Guinevere&#x27;s affair; the long blood feud between the families of King Lot and King Pellinore; and the mystical Grail Quest. Each of these plots would define one of the causes of the downfall of Arthur&#x27;s kingdom, namely &quot;the failures in love, in loyalty, in religion.&quot; Beverly Kennedy opined that the central theme of the work is that of adultery, from the begetting of Arthur to the cause of his fall. Much of the Malory scholarship is concerned specifically with the issues relating to the subject of Lancelot and Guinevere&#x27;s adultery.

===Volumes and internal chronology===
Prior to Caxton&#x27;s reorganization, Malory&#x27;s work originally consisted of eight volumes (one of them was also divided into two parts). The following list uses Winchester Manuscript (Malory&#x27;s &quot;Syr&quot; is usually rendered &quot;Sir&quot; today) as well as William Caxton&#x27;s print edition and modern titles by Arthurian scholars Eugène Vinaver and P. J. C. Field:

#The birth and rise of Arthur: Fro the Maryage of Kynge Uther unto Kyng Arthure that Regned Aftir Hym and Ded Many Batayles (Caxton&#x27;s Books I–IV, Vinaver&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of King Arthur&quot;, Field&#x27;s &quot;King Uther and King Arthur&quot;)
#Arthur&#x27;s war against the resurgent Western Romans: The Noble Tale betwyxt Kynge Arthure and Lucius the Emperour of Rome, alternatively The Tale of the Noble Kynge Arthure That Was Emperoure Hymself thorow Dygnyté of His Hondys (Caxton&#x27;s Book V, Vinaver&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of the Noble King Arthur That Was Emperor Himself through Dignity of His Hands&quot;, Field&#x27;s &quot;King Arthur and the Emperor Lucius&quot;)

#The breakup of the Knights of the Round Table and the last battle of Arthur: The Moste Pyteuous Tale of Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur Saunz Gwerdon [meaning &quot;Without Reward&quot;, usually corrected to &quot;saunz Guerdon&quot;] (Caxton&#x27;s Books XX–XXI, Vinaver&#x27;s &quot;The Death of King Arthur or The Most Piteous Tale of the Morte Arthur saunz Guerdon&quot;; also known as &quot;The Death of Arthur&quot; in modern scholarship)

Moorman attempted to put the books of the Winchester Manuscript in chronological order. In his analysis, Malory&#x27;s intended chronology can be divided into three parts: Book I followed by a 20-year interval that includes some events of Book V (Lancelot and Elaine 
– from the meeting of the two to the madness of Lancelot); the 15-year-long period of Book V, also spanning Books IV (takes place after the adventure of the Cote de Mal Tale), II (takes place between King Mark and Alexander the Orphan), and III (takes place between Alexander the Orphan and the Tournament of Surluse); Lancelot meets Bliant after the Tournament of Lonezep towards the end of Lancelot and Elaine section; the section of Sir Palomides takes place after Lancelot returns to Arthur&#x27;s court; and finally Books VI, VII, and VIII in a straightforward sequence beginning with the closing part of Book V (the conclusion section).

===Style===
Like other English prose in the 15th century, &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; was highly influenced by French writings, but Malory blends these with other English verse and prose forms. The northeastern Warwickshire dialect late Middle English of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; is much closer to Early Modern English than the Middle English of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; (the publication of Chaucer&#x27;s work by Caxton was a precursor to Caxton&#x27;s publication of Malory); if the spelling is modernised, it reads almost like Elizabethan English. Where the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; are in Middle English, Malory extends &quot;one hand to Chaucer, and one to Spenser,&quot; by constructing a manuscript that is hard to place in one category. His writing can be divisive today, often regarded by critics (including prominent scholars such as Vinaver, George Saintsbury, Robert Lumiansky, C.S Lewis, and E. K. Chambers) as simplistic and unsophisticated from an artistic viewpoint. Conversely, there are also opposite opinions, even regarding it a &quot;supreme aesthetic accomplishment&quot; (William Calin). For a modern audience, his prose may feel better when modernised (and perhaps especially when also dramatically performed aloud) than as it reads in its original form.

Other aspects of Malory&#x27;s writing style include his abrupt abridging of much of the source material, especially in the early parts concerning Arthur&#x27;s backstory and his rise to power (preferring the later adventures of the knights), apparently acting on an authorial assumption that the reader knows the story already and resulting in the problem of omitting important things &quot;thereby often rendering his text obscure&quot;, and how he would sometimes turn descriptions of characters into proper names. Because there is so much lengthy ground to cover, Malory uses &quot;so—and—then&quot;, often to transition his retelling of the stories that become episodes instead of instances that can stand on their own.

==Synopsis and analysis==

===Book I (Caxton I–IV)===
Arthur is born to the High King of Britain (Malory&#x27;s &quot;England&quot;) Uther Pendragon and his new wife Igraine, and then taken by the wizard Merlin to be secretly fostered by Arthur&#x27;s uncle Ector in the country in turmoil after the death of Uther. Years later, the now teenage Arthur suddenly becomes the ruler of the leaderless Britain when he removes the fated sword from the stone in the contest set up by Merlin, which proves his birthright that he himself had not been aware of. The newly crowned King Arthur and his followers including King Ban and King Bors go on to fight against rivals and rebels, ultimately winning the war in the great Battle of Bedegraine. Arthur prevails due to his military prowess and the prophetic and magical counsel of Merlin (later eliminated and replaced by the sorceress Nimue), further helped by the sword Excalibur that Arthur received from a Lady of the Lake. With the help of reconciled rebels, Arthur also crushes a foreign invasion in the Battle of Clarence. With his throne secure, Arthur marries the also young Princess Guinevere and inherits the Round Table from her father, King Leodegrance. He then gathers his chief knights, including some of his former enemies who now joined him, at his capital Camelot and establishes the Round Table fellowship as all swear to the Pentecostal Oath (Malory&#x27;s invention) as a guide for knightly conduct.

It also includes the tale of Balyn and Balan (a lengthy section which Malory called a &quot;booke&quot; in itself), as well as some other episodes, such as King Pellinore&#x27;s hunt for the Questing Beast and the treason of Arthur&#x27;s sorceress half-sister Queen Morgan le Fay in the plot involving her lover Accolon. Furthermore, it tells of begetting of Arthur&#x27;s incestuous son Mordred by one of his other royal half-sisters, Morgause (though Arthur did not know her as his sister). On Merlin&#x27;s advice, Arthur then takes away every newborn boy in his kingdom and all of them but Mordred (who miraculously survives and eventually indeed will kill his father in the end) perish at sea; this is mentioned matter-of-factly, with no apparent moral overtone.

The narrative of the first book is mainly based on the Prose &quot;Merlin&quot; in its version from the Post-Vulgate &quot;Suite du Merlin&quot; (possibly the manuscript Cambridge University Library, Additional 7071). Malory addresses his contemporary preoccupations with legitimacy and societal unrest, which will appear throughout the rest of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. His concern reflects the 15th-century England, where many were claiming their rights to power through violence and bloodshed. According to Helen Cooper in &quot;Sir Thomas Malory: Le Morte D&#x27;arthur – The Winchester Manuscript&quot;, the prose style, which mimics historical documents of the time, lends an air of authority to the whole work. This allowed contemporaries to read the book as a history rather than as a work of fiction, therefore making it a model of order for Malory&#x27;s violent and chaotic times during the Wars of the Roses, arguably resembling his contemporary &quot;John Vale&#x27;s Book&quot;.

===Book II (Caxton V)===
The opening of the second volume finds Arthur and his kingdom without an enemy. His throne is secure, and his knights including Griflet and Tor as well as Arthur&#x27;s own nephews Gawain and Ywain (sons of Morgause and Morgan, respectively) have proven themselves in various battles and fantastic quests as told in the first volume. Seeking more glory, Arthur and his knights then go to the war against (fictitious) Emperor Lucius who has just demanded Britain to resume paying tribute. Departing from Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s literary tradition in which Mordred is left in charge (as this happens there near the end of the story), Malory&#x27;s Arthur leaves his court in the hands of Constantine of Cornwall and sails to Normandy to meet his cousin Hoel. After that, the story details Arthur&#x27;s march on Rome through Almaine (Germany) and Italy. Following a series of battles resulting in the great victory over Lucius and his allies, and the Roman Senate&#x27;s surrender, Arthur is crowned a Western Emperor but instead arranges a proxy government and returns to Britain.

This book is based mostly on the first half of the Middle English heroic poem Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot; (itself heavily based on Geoffrey&#x27;s pseudo-chronicle &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;). Caxton&#x27;s print version is abridged by more than half compared to Malory&#x27;s manuscript. Vinaver theorized that Malory originally wrote this part first as a standalone work, while without knowledge of French romances. In effect, there is a time lapse that includes Arthur&#x27;s war against King Claudas in France.

===Book III (Caxton VI)===
Going back to a time before Book II, Malory establishes Lancelot, a young French orphan prince, as King Arthur&#x27;s most revered knight through numerous episodic adventures, some of which he presented in comedic manner. Lancelot always adheres to the Pentecostal Oath, assisting ladies in distress and giving mercy for honourable enemies he has defeated in combat. However, the world Lancelot lives in is too complicated for simple mandates and, although Lancelot aspires to live by an ethical code, the actions of others make it difficult.

Lancelot&#x27;s character had previously appeared in the chronologically later Book II, fighting for Arthur against the Romans. In Book III, based on parts of the French Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot; (mostly its &#x27;Agravain&#x27; section, along with the chapel perilous episode taken from &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;), his character is widely regarded as of central importance to the entire work, representing &quot;the very paradigm of Malorian knighthood&quot;. Malory attempts to turn the focus of courtly love from adultery to service by having Lancelot dedicate doing everything he does for Queen Guinevere, the wife of his lord and friend Arthur, but avoid (for a time being) to committing to an adulterous relationship with her. Nevertheless, it is still her love that is the ultimate source of Lancelot&#x27;s supreme knightly qualities, something that Malory himself did not appear to be fully comfortable with as it seems to have clashed with his personal ideal of knighthood. Although a catalyst of the fall of Camelot, as it was in the French romantic prose cycle tradition, the moral handling of the adultery between Lancelot and Guinevere in &quot;Le Morte&quot; implies their relationship is true and pure, as Malory focused on the ennobling aspects of courtly love. Other issues are demonstrated when Morgan enchants Lancelot, which reflects a feminization of magic, and in how the prominence of jousting tournament fighting in this tale indicates a shift away from battlefield warfare towards a more mediated and virtuous form of violence.

=== Book IV (Caxton VII) ===


The fourth volume primarily deals with the adventures of the young Gareth (&quot;Beaumains&quot;) in his long quest for the sibling ladies Lynette and Lioness. The youngest of Arthur&#x27;s nephews by Morgause and King Lot, Gareth hides his identity as a nameless squire at Camelot as to achieve his knighthood in the most honest and honourable way. While this particular story is not directly based on any existing text unlike most of the content of previous volumes, it resembles various Arthurian romances of the Fair Unknown type.

===Book V (Caxton VIII–XII)===
A long collection of the tales about Tristan of Lyonesse as well as a variety of other knights such as Dinadan, Lamorak, Palamedes, Alexander the Orphan (Tristan&#x27;s young relative abducted by Morgan), and &quot;La Cote de Male Tayle&quot;. After telling of Tristan&#x27;s birth and childhood, its primary focus is on the doomed adulterous relationship between Tristan and the Belle Isolde, wife of his villainous uncle King Mark. It also includes the retrospective story of how Galahad was fathered by Lancelot to Princess Elaine of Corbenic, followed by Lancelot&#x27;s years of madness.

Malory&#x27;s treatment of the legend of the young Cornish prince Tristan is the centerpiece of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; as well as the longest of his eight books. It constitutes around a third of the entire work and was itself formally divided by the author into two &quot;bookes&quot;. It is based mainly on the French vast Prose &quot;Tristan&quot; (highly abridged by 5/6), combining its Version II for Malory&#x27;s first part and its Version IV for his second part, or perhaps on its lost English adaptation (and possibly also the Middle English verse romance &quot;Sir Tristrem&quot;). The variety of episodes, and the alleged lack of structural coherence in the Tristan narrative, raised questions about its role in Malory&#x27;s text. Vinaver condemned it as &quot;long and monotonous&quot; and suggested it to be left for the last, his view shared by much of classic scholarship. Others, conversely, have since praised or at very least partially approved of the book, arguably an essential reading due to how Malory foreshadows and prepares for the rest of his work by developing or forecasting a variety of characters, themes, and tales found in the later books. It can be seen as an exploration of secular chivalry and a discussion of earthly &quot;worship&quot; (in the meaning of glory and reputation) when it is founded in a sense of shame and honor. If &quot;Le Morte&quot; is viewed as a text in which Malory is attempting to define the concept of knighthood, then the tale of Tristan becomes its critique, rather than Malory attempting to create an ideal knight as he does in some of the other books.

===Book VI (Caxton XIII–XVII)===
Malory&#x27;s primary source for this long part was the Vulgate &quot;Queste del Saint Graal&quot;, chronicling the adventures of many Knights of the Round Table in their mostly separate, pilgrimage-like journeys to find the Holy Grail. Gawain is the first to embark on the search for the Grail, followed by others including Lancelot who likewise undergo the quest, traveling either in small groups of changing composition or alone. Their martial and spiritual exploits are intermingled with encounters with maidens and hermits who offer advice and interpret dreams along the way. It is ultimately achieved by Galahad and his final companions, Percival and Bors the Younger.

After the confusion of the secular moral code he manifested within the previous book, Malory attempts to construct a new mode of chivalry by placing an emphasis on religion, albeit somewhat less than his French sources did, the degree of difference depending on an interpretation. As in the &quot;Queste&quot;, the framework for the interactions between the Grail knights (Galahad, Percival, and Bors) is based on Saint Aelred&#x27;s ideas from his book &quot;Spiritual Friendship&quot;. Christianity and the Church offer a venue through which the Pentecostal Oath can be upheld, whereas the strict moral code imposed by religion foreshadows almost certain failure on the part of the knights. For instance, Gawain refuses to do penance for his sins, claiming the tribulations that coexist with knighthood as a sort of secular penance. Likewise, the flawed Lancelot, for all his sincerity, is unable to completely escape his adulterous love of Guinevere, and is thus destined to fail where Galahad will succeed. This coincides with the personification of perfection in the form of Galahad, a virgin wielding the power of God. Galahad&#x27;s life, uniquely entirely without sin, makes him a model of a holy knight that cannot be emulated through secular chivalry. Nevertheless, in contrast to the striking condemnation and humiliation of Lancelot&#x27;s character in the &quot;Queste&quot;, Malory&#x27;s version of the Knight of the Lake continues to be the paragon of, at least, earthly honor. According to Terence McCarthy, the Book VI may have been Malory&#x27;s original composition.

===Book VII (Caxton XVIII–XIX)===
Following the quest for the Holy Grail, Lancelot tries to maintain his knightly virtues but finds himself drawn back into his illicit romance with Guinevere. He stays true to her, tragically rejecting the desperate love of Elaine of Ascolat, and completes a series of trials that culminates in his rescue of the Queen from the abduction by the renegade knight Maleagant (this is also the first time the work explicitly mentions the couple&#x27;s sexual adultery).

Writing it, Malory combined the established material from the Vulgate Cycle&#x27;s early Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot; (including its abridged retelling of &quot;Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart&quot;), and the early parts of the Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot;, with his own creations (the episodes &quot;The Great Tournament&quot; and &quot;The Healing of Sir Urry&quot;). A key theme emphasised at the end of each of the book&#x27;s five tales is forgiveness.

=== Book VIII (Caxton XX–XXI) ===
A disaster strikes when King Arthur&#x27;s bastard son Mordred and his half-brother Agravain succeed in revealing Queen Guinevere&#x27;s adultery and Arthur sentences her to burn. Lancelot&#x27;s rescue party raids the execution, killing several loyal knights of the Round Table, including, unwittingly, Gawain&#x27;s younger brothers Gareth and Gaheris. Gawain, bent on revenge, prompts Arthur into a long and bitter civil war with Lancelot. After they leave to pursue Lancelot in France, where Gawain is mortally injured in a duel with Lancelot (and later finally reconciles with him on his death bed), Mordred seizes the throne and takes control of Arthur&#x27;s kingdom. At the bloody final battle between Mordred&#x27;s followers and Arthur&#x27;s remaining loyalists in England, Arthur kills Mordred but is himself gravely wounded. As Arthur is dying, the lone survivor Bedivere casts Excalibur away, and Morgan and Nimue come together to take Arthur to Avalon. Following the disappearance and presumed passing of King Arthur, who is succeeded by Constantine, Malory provides a short epilogue about the later lives and deaths of Bedivere, Guinevere, and Lancelot and his kinsmen.

Writing the eponymous final book, Malory used the version of Arthur&#x27;s death derived primarily from parts of the Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot; and, as a secondary source, from the English Stanzaic &quot;Morte Arthur&quot; (or, in another possibility, a hypothetical now-lost French modification of the &quot;Mort Artu&quot; was a common source of both of these texts). In the words of George Brown, the book &quot;celebrates the greatness of the Arthurian world on the eve of its ruin. As the magnificent fellowship turns violently upon itself, death and destruction also produce repentance, forgiveness, and salvation.&quot; 

== Modern versions and adaptations ==
Following the lapse of 182 years since the last printing, the year 1816 saw a new edition by Alexander Chalmers, illustrated by Thomas Uwins (&quot;The History of the Renowned Prince Arthur, King of Britain; with His Life and Death, and All His Glorious Battles. Likewise, the Noble Acts and Heroic Deeds of His Valiant Knights of the Round Table&quot;), as well as another one by Joseph Haslewood (&quot;La Mort D&#x27;Arthur: The Most Ancient and Famous History of the Renowned Prince Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table&quot;); both of these were based on the 1634 Stansby&#x27;s version. Several other modern editions, including these by Thomas Wright (&quot;La Morte D&#x27;Arthure: The History of King Arthur and of the Knights of the Round Table&quot;, 1858) and Ernest Rhys (&quot;Malory&#x27;s History of King Arthur and the Quest of The Holy Grail: From The Morte D&#x27;Arthur&quot;, 1886), were also based on that by Stansby.

William Upcott&#x27;s edition directly based on then-newly rediscovered Morgan copy of the first print Caxton version was published as &quot;Malory&#x27;s Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; with Robert Southey&#x27;s introduction and notes including summaries of the original French material from the Vulgate tradition in 1817. Afterwards, Caxton became the basis for many subsequent editions until the 1934 discovery of the Winchester Manuscript.

The first mass-printed modern edition of Caxton was published in 1868 by Edward Strachey as a book for boys titled &quot;Le Morte Darthur: Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s Book of King Arthur and His Noble Knights of the Round Table&quot;, highly censored in accordance to Victorian morals. Many other 19th-century editors, abridgers and retellers such as Henry Frith (&quot;King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table&quot;, 1884) would also censor their versions for the same reason. The first &quot;standard&quot; popular edition, based on Caxton was Heinrich Oskar Sommer&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte Darthur by Syr Thomas Malory&quot; published in 1890 with an introduction and glossary as well as an essay on Malory&#x27;s prose style, followed by these by John Rhys in 1893 (Everyman&#x27;s Library) and Israel Gollancz in 1897 (Temple Classics).

Modernized editions update the late Middle English spelling, update some pronouns, and re-punctuate and re-paragraph the text. Others furthermore update the phrasing and vocabulary to contemporary Modern English. The following sentence (from Caxton&#x27;s preface, addressed to the reader) is an example written in Middle English and then in Modern English:

:&quot;Doo after the good and leve the evyl, and it shal brynge you to good fame and renomme.&quot; (Do after the good and leave the evil, and it shall bring you to good fame and renown.)

Since the 19th-century Arthurian revival, there have been numerous modern republications, retellings and adaptations of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. A few of them are listed below (see also the following Bibliography section):

* Malory&#x27;s book inspired Reginald Heber&#x27;s unfinished poem &quot;Morte D&#x27;Arthur&quot;. A fragment of it was published by Heber&#x27;s widow in 1830.
* Victorian poet Alfred Tennyson retold the legends in the poetry volume &quot;Idylls of the King&quot; (1859 and 1885). His work focuses on &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; and the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, with many expansions, additions and several adaptations, such as the fate of Guinevere (in Malory, she is sentenced to be burnt at the stake but is rescued by Lancelot; in the &quot;Idylls&quot;, Guinevere flees to a convent, is forgiven by Arthur, repents and serves in the convent until her death).
* James Thomas Knowles published &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; as &quot;The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights&quot; in 1860. Knowles described it as &quot;an abridgment of Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s version ... with a few additions from Geoffrey of Monmouth and other sources—and an endeavor to arrange the many tales into a more or less consecutive story.&quot; Originally illustrated by George Housman Thomas, it has been subsequently illustrated by various other artists, including William Henry Margetson and Louis Rhead. The 1912 edition was illustrated by Lancelot Speed, who later also illustrated Rupert S. Holland&#x27;s 1919 &quot;King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table&quot; that was based on Knowles with addition of some material from the 12th-century &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;.
* In 1880, Sidney Lanier published a much expurgated rendition entitled &quot;The Boy&#x27;s King Arthur: Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s History of King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table, Edited for Boys&quot;, an enduringly popular children&#x27;s adaptation, originally illustrated by Alfred Kappes. A new edition with illustrations by N. C. Wyeth was first published in 1917. This version was later incorporated into Grosset and Dunlap&#x27;s series of books called the Illustrated Junior Library, and reprinted under the title &quot;King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table&quot; (1950).
* In 1892, London publisher J. M. Dent produced an illustrated edition of &quot;Le Morte Darthur&quot; in modern spelling, with illustrations by 20-year-old insurance office clerk and art student Aubrey Beardsley. It was issued in 12 volumes between June 1893 and mid-1894, and met with only modest success, but was later described as Beardsley&#x27;s first masterpiece, launching what has come to be known as the &quot;Beardsley look&quot;. It was Beardsley&#x27;s first major commission, and included nearly 585 chapter openings, borders, initials, ornaments and full- or double-page illustrations. The majority of the Dent edition illustrations were reprinted by Dover Publications in 1972 under the title &quot;Beardsley&#x27;s Illustrations for Le Morte Darthur&quot;. A facsimile of the Beardsley edition, complete with Malory&#x27;s unabridged text, was published in the 1990s.
* Mary MacLeod&#x27;s popular children&#x27;s adaptation &quot;King Arthur and His Noble Knights: Stories From Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s Morte D&#x27;Arthur&quot; was first published with illustrations by Arthur George Walker in 1900 and subsequently reprinted in various editions and in extracts in children&#x27;s magazines.
* Beatrice Clay wrote a retelling first included in her &quot;Stories from Le Morte Darthur and the Mabinogion&quot; (1901). A retitled version, &quot;Stories of King Arthur and the Round Table&quot; (1905), features illustrations by Dora Curtis.
* In 1902, Andrew Lang published &quot;The Book of Romance&quot;, a retelling of Malory illustrated by Henry Justice Ford. It was retitled as &quot;Tales of King Arthur and the Round Table&quot; in the 1909 edition.
* Howard Pyle wrote and illustrated a series of four books: &quot;The Story of King Arthur and His Knights&quot; (1903), &quot;The Story of the Champions of the Round Table&quot; (1905), &quot;The Story of Sir Launcelot and His Companions&quot; (1907), and &quot;The Story of the Grail and the Passing of King Arthur&quot; (1910). Rather than retell the stories as written, Pyle presented his own versions of select episodes enhanced with other tales and his own imagination.
* Another children&#x27;s adaptation, Henry Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;King Arthur&#x27;s Knights: The Tales Retold for Boys and Girls&quot;, was first published in 1911, originally illustrated by Walter Crane. Highly popular, it was reprinted many times until 1940, featuring also illustrations from other artists such as Frances Brundage and Thomas Heath Robinson.
* Alfred W. Pollard published an abridged edition of Malory in 1917, illustrated by Arthur Rackham. Pollard later also published a complete version in four volumes during 1910–1911 and in two volumes in 1920, with illustrations by William Russell Flint.
* T. H. White&#x27;s &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; (1938–1977) is a famous and influential retelling of Malory&#x27;s work. White rewrote the story in his own fashion. His rendition contains intentional and obvious anachronisms and social-political commentary on contemporary matters. White made Malory himself a character and bestowed upon him the highest praise.
* Pollard&#x27;s 1910–1911 abridged edition of Malory provided basis for John W. Donaldson&#x27;s 1943 book &quot;Arthur Pendragon of Britain&quot;. It was illustrated by N. C. Wyeth son, Andrew Wyeth.
* Roger Lancelyn Green&#x27;s book &quot;King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table&quot; was published in 1953, with illustrations by the filmmaker Lotte Reiniger. This retelling is based mainly on Malory, but includes tales from other sources such as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle.
* Alice Mary Hadfield retold the stories as &quot;King Arthur and the Round Table&quot; (1953), with illustrations by Donald Seton Cammell, in the series &quot;The Children&#x27;s Illustrated Classics,&quot; published by Dent /Dutton. 
* Alex Blum&#x27;s comic book retelling &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; was published in the &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; series in 1953.
* John Steinbeck utilized the Winchester Manuscripts of Thomas Malory and other sources as the original text for his &quot;The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights&quot;. This retelling was intended for young people but was never completed. It was published posthumously in 1976 as &quot;The Book of King Arthur and His Noble Knights of the Round Table&quot;.
* Walker Percy credited his childhood reading of &quot;The Boy&#x27;s King Arthur&quot; for his own novel &quot;Lancelot&quot; (1977).
* Thomas Berger described his 1978 novel &quot;Arthur Rex&quot; as his memory of the &quot;childish version&quot; by Elizabeth Lodor Merchant that began his fascination in the Arthurian legend in 1931.
* &quot;Excalibur&quot;, a 1981 British film directed, produced, and co-written by John Boorman, retells &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, with some changes to the plot and fate of certain characters (such as merging Morgause with Morgan, who dies in this version).
* Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s 1983 &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; retold &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; from a feminist neopagan perspective.
* In 1984, the ending of Malory&#x27;s story was turned by John Barton and Gillian Lynne into a BBC2 non-speaking (that is featuring only Malory&#x27;s narration and silent actors) television drama, titled simply &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;.
* Emma Gelders Sterne, Barbara Lindsay, Gustaf Tenggren and Mary Pope Osborne published &quot;King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table&quot; in 2002.
* Jeff Limke&#x27;s and Tom Yeates&#x27; comic book adaptation of a part of Malory&#x27;s Book I was published as &quot;King Arthur: Excalibur Unsheathed&quot; in 2006, followed by &quot;Arthur &amp; Lancelot: The Fight for Camelot&quot; in 2007.
* Castle Freeman Jr.&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;Go with Me&quot; is a modern retelling of Malory&#x27;s &quot;Tale of Sir Gareth&quot;.
* In 2009, Dorsey Armstrong published a Modern English translation that focused on the Winchester manuscript rather than the Caxton edition.
* Peter Ackroyd&#x27;s 2010 novel &quot;The Death of King Arthur&quot; is a modern English retelling of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;.
* Chris Crawford&#x27;s 2023 game &quot;Le morte D&#x27;Arthur&quot; features interactive story where one plays for Arthur and decides about course of action.

<doc id="419490" wikidata="Q467650" url="?curid=419490" title="Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba">
<text>Nzinga Ana de Sousa Mbande, Nzinga (; – 17 December 1663) was a southwest African ruler who ruled as queen of the Ambundu Kingdoms of Ndongo (1624–1663) and Matamba (1631–1663), located in present-day northern Angola. Born into the ruling family of Ndongo, her grandfather Ngola Kilombo Kia Kasenda was the king of Ndongo.

Njinga received military and political training as a child, and she demonstrated an aptitude for defusing political crises as an ambassador to the Portuguese Empire. In 1624, she assumed power over Ndongo after the death of her brother Mbandi. She ruled during a period of rapid growth of the African slave trade and encroachment by the Portuguese Empire in South West Africa. 

The Portuguese declared war on Ndongo in 1626 and by 1628, Njinga&#x27;s army had been severely depleted and they went into exile. In search of allies, she married Imbangala warlord Kasanje. Using this new alliance to rebuild her forces, she conquered the Kingdom of Matamba from 1631 to 1635. In 1641, she entered into an alliance with the Dutch West India Company who had captured Luanda from the Portuguese. Between 1641 and 1644, Njinga was able to reclaim large parts of Ndongo. Alongside the Dutch, she defeated the Portuguese in a number of battles but was unable to take the Fortress of Massangano. In 1648, the Portuguese recaptured Luanda, with the Dutch leaving Angola. Njinga continued to fight the Portuguese until a peace treaty was signed in 1656.

In the centuries since her death, Njinga has been increasingly recognized as a major historical figure in Angola and in the wider Atlantic Creole culture. She is remembered for her intelligence, her political and diplomatic wisdom, and her military tactics.

==Early life==

Njinga was born into the royal family of Ndongo, a Mbundu kingdom in central West Africa around 1583. She was the daughter of &quot;Ngola&quot; (a noble title translatable to &quot;King&quot;) Kilombo of Ndongo. Her mother, Kengela ka Nkombe, was one of her father&#x27;s slave wives and his favorite concubine. According to legend, the birthing process was very difficult for Kengela, her mother; Njinga received her name because the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck (the Kimbundu verb &quot;kujinga&quot; means to twist or turn). Children of the royal household who survived difficult or unusual births were believed to possess spiritual gifts, and some saw their births as an indicator the person would grow to become a powerful and proud person. Njinga had two sisters, Kambu, or Lady Barbara and Funji, or Lady Grace. She also had a brother, Mbandi, who was heir apparent to throne.

When she was 10 years old, her father became the king of the Ndongo. As a child, Njinga was greatly favored by her father. Since she was not considered an heir to the throne, she was not seen as direct competition to male members of the family, and so the king could freely lavish attention upon her without offending his more likely heirs. She received military training and was trained as a warrior to fight alongside her father, displaying considerable aptitude with a battle axe, the traditional weapon of Ndongan warriors. She participated in many official and governance duties alongside her father, including legal councils, war councils, and important rituals. Furthermore, Njinga was taught by visiting Portuguese missionaries to read and write in Portuguese.

===Name variations===
Queen Njinga Mbande is known by many different names including both Kimbundu and Portuguese names, alternate spellings and various honorifics. Common spellings found in Portuguese and English sources include &quot;Nzinga&quot;, &quot;Nzingha&quot;, &quot;Njinga&quot;, and &quot;Njingha&quot;. In colonial documentation, including her own manuscripts, her name was also spelled &quot;Jinga&quot;, &quot;Ginga&quot;, &quot;Zinga&quot;, &quot;Zingua&quot;, &quot;Zhinga&quot;, and &quot;Singa&quot;. She was also known by her Christian name, Ana de Sousa. This name—Anna de Souza Nzingha—was given to her when she was baptized. She was named Anna after the Portuguese woman who acted as her Godmother at the ceremony. She helped influence who Nzingha was in the future. Her Christian surname, de Souza, came from the acting governor of Angola, João Correia de Souza.

As a monarch of Ndongo and Matamba, her native name was Ngola Njinga. &quot;Ngola&quot; was the Ndongo name for the ruler and the etymological root of &quot;Angola&quot;. In Portuguese, she was known as Rainha Nzinga/Zinga/Ginga (Queen Nzingha). According to the current Kimbundu orthography, her name is spelled &quot;Njinga Mbandi&quot; (the &quot;j&quot; is a voiced postalveolar fricative or &quot;soft j&quot; as in Portuguese and French, while the adjacent &quot;n&quot; is silent). The statue of Njinga now standing in the square of Kinaxixi in Luanda calls her &quot;Mwene Njinga Mbande&quot;.

=== Political background ===
During this period, the kingdom of Ndongo was managing multiple crises, largely due to conflicts with the Portuguese Empire. The Portuguese had first come to Ndongo in 1575 when they established a trading post in Luanda with the help of the Kingdom of Kongo, Ndongo&#x27;s northern rival. Despite several years of initial peace between Ndongo and Portugal, relations soured between the two kingdoms and devolved into decades of war between them. Ndongo faced intense military pressure from Portugal and Kongo, both of which seized Ndongan territory. By the 1580s, large parts of Ndongo had fallen under Portuguese control. The Portuguese waged war in a brutal style, burning villages and taking hostages. In addition to territorial conquests, the Portuguese seized large numbers of slaves during the conflict (50,000 according to one source) and built forts inside Ndongan territory to control the slave trade. 

Ndongo rallied against the Portuguese, defeating Portugal at the Battle of Lucala in 1590, but not before the kingdom had lost much of its territory. The conflict eroded the power of the king, with many Ndongan noblemen, &quot;sobas&quot;, refusing to pay tribute to the crown and some siding with the Portuguese. By the time that Nzingha&#x27;s father became king in 1593, the region had been devastated by war and the power of the king greatly diminished. The king tried a variety of methods to handle the crisis, including diplomacy, negotiations, and open warfare, but he was unable to improve the situation.

The situation grew worse for Ndongo when in 1607 the kingdom was invaded by the Imbangala, tribal bands of warriors known for their ferocity in battle and religious fervor. The Imbangala divided themselves into warbands, occupying Ndongan territory and capturing slaves. The Portuguese hired some of the Imbangalans as mercenaries, and the new threat forced the Ndongan king to give up any attempts to reconquer his lost territory.

==Succession to power==

=== Nzinga&#x27;s Embassy ===
In 1617, Ngola Mbandi Kiluanji died and Ngola Mbandi, his son and Nzinga&#x27;s brother, came to power. Upon assuming the throne, he engaged in months of political bloodletting, killing many rival claimants to the throne, including his older half-brother and their family. Thirty-five at the time, Nzingha was spared, but the new king ordered her young son killed while she and her two sisters were forcibly sterilized, ensuring that she would never have a child again. According to some sources, Nzingha was singled out for harsh treatment as she had a longstanding rivalry with her brother. Perhaps fearing for her life, Nzinga fled to the Kingdom of Matamba.

Having consolidated his power, Mbandi vowed to continue the war against the Portuguese. However, he lacked military skill, and while he was able to form an alliance with the Imbangala, the Portuguese made significant military gains. Faced with the Portuguese threat, in 1621 he contacted Nzingha, asking her to be his emissary to the Portuguese in Luanda. She was the best fit for the job, as she was both of royal lineage and spoke fluent Portuguese. She agreed to lead the diplomatic mission with the stipulation that she be granted the authority to negotiate in the king&#x27;s name and permission to be baptized – an important diplomatic tool she hoped to use against the Portuguese. Nzingha departed the Ndongan capital with a large retinue and was received with considerable interest in Luanda, compelling the Portuguese governor to pay for all of her party&#x27;s expenses. While Ndongo leaders typically met the Portuguese in European clothing, she chose to wear opulent traditional clothing (including feathers and jewels) of the Ndongan people, to display that their culture was not inferior. According to a popular story, when Nzingha arrived to meet with the Portuguese, there were chairs for the Portuguese officials but only a mat provided for her. This type of behavior from the Portuguese was common; it was their way of displaying a &quot;subordinate status, a status reserved for conquered Africans.&quot; In response to this, Nzingha&#x27;s attendant formed himself to be her chair while she spoke to the governor face to face. She employed flattery as a diplomatic tool, and according to some sources deliberately chose to contrast her brother&#x27;s belligerent style with her own diplomatic decorum.

As ambassador, Nzingha&#x27;s main goal was to secure peace between her people and the Portuguese. To this end, she promised the Portuguese an end to hostilities (describing her brother&#x27;s previous actions as the mistakes of a young king), allowed Portuguese slave traders inside Ndongo, and offered to return escaped Portuguese slaves fighting in her brother&#x27;s army. In return, she demanded that Portugal remove the forts built inside Ndongan territory and was adamant that Ndongo would not pay tribute to Portugal, noting that only conquered peoples paid tribute and her people had not been defeated. She also expressed a desire for cooperation between the two kingdoms, noting that they could support each-other against their common enemies in the region. When the Portuguese questioned her commitment to peace, Nzingha offered to be publicly baptized, which she was with great aplomb in Luanda. She adopted the name &quot;Dona Anna de Sousa&quot; in honor of her godparents, Ana da Silva (the governor&#x27;s wife and her ordained godmother) and Governor Joao Correia de Sousa. A peace treaty was subsequently agreed upon, and Nzingha returned to Kabasa in triumph in late 1622.

Despite her success in the negotiations with the Portuguese, the peace between Ndongo and the Imbangala – themselves engaged in expanding their territory – collapsed. After a series of defeats, the Ndongan royal family was driven out of their court in Kabasa, putting the king in exile and allowing for some of the Imbangala to establish the Kingdom of Kasanje. The Portuguese governor wanted to proceed with the treaty, but refused to aid Ndongo against the Imbangala until the king had recaptured Kabasa and been baptized. King Mbandi retook Kabasa in 1623 and took tentative steps towards Christianity, but remained deeply distrustful of the Portuguese. An increasingly powerful figure in the royal court, Nzingha (in a possible political ploy) warned her brother that a baptism would offend his traditionalist supporters, convincing him to reject any idea of being baptized. In addition, the Portuguese began reneging on the treaty, refusing to withdraw from their fortresses inside Ndongo and conducting raids for loot and slaves into Ndongo&#x27;s territory. By 1624, King Mbandi had fallen into a deep depression and was forced to cede many of his duties to Nzingha.

== Wartime ==
=== Rise to power ===
In 1624, her brother died of mysterious causes (some say suicide, others say poisoning). Before his death, he had made it clear that Nzinga should be his successor. Nzinga quickly moved to consolidate her rule, having her supporters seize the ritual objects associated with the monarchy and eliminating her opponents at court. She also assumed the title of &quot;Ngola&quot;, conferring a position of great influence among her people. An opulent funeral for her brother was arranged, and some of his remains were preserved in a &quot;misete&quot; (a reliquary), so they could later be consulted by Nzinga. One major obstacle to her rule, her 7-year-old nephew, was under the guardianship of Kasa, an Imbangala war chief. To remove this potential pretender to her throne, Nzinga approached Kasa with a marriage proposal; the couple were married, and after the wedding she had her nephew killed—in Nzinga&#x27;s view, final revenge for her own murdered son.

However, her ascension to the throne faced severe opposition from male claimants from other noble families. According to Mbande tradition, neither Nzinga nor her predecessor brother had a direct right to the throne because they were children of slave wives, not the first wife. Nzinga countered this argument, strategically using the claim that she was properly descended from the main royal line through her father, as opposed to her rivals had no bloodline connection. Her opponents, on the other hand, used other precedents to discredit her, such as that she was a female and thus ineligible. In addition, Nzinga&#x27;s willingness to negotiate with the Portuguese (as opposed to previous rulers, who had fought against them) was seen as a sign of weakness by some of the Ndongan nobility; specifically, the treaty&#x27;s allowing of Portuguese missionaries inside Ndongo was seen with distaste.

While the succession crisis deepened, relations between Ndongo and Portugal became more complex. Nzinga hoped to fulfill the treaty she had signed with the Portuguese in 1621, and thereby regain Ndongan lands lost during her brother&#x27;s disastrous wars. Governor de Sousa was also keen to avoid conflict, and both he and Nzinga were eager to re-open the slave trade that was so vital to the region&#x27;s economy. However, tensions rose between Nzinga and de Sousa. When Nzinga asked for the return of &quot;kijikos&quot; (a servile caste of slaves traditionally owned by the Ndongan royalty) living in Portuguese controlled territory, as had been agreed in the treaty, de Sousa refused and demanded that Nzinga return escaped Portuguese slaves serving in her army first. De Sousa also demanded that Nzinga become a vassal of the king of Portugal and pay tribute, demands she refused outright. Further straining relations, in late 1624 de Sousa began an aggressive campaign to force Mbande nobles, &quot;sobas&quot;, to become Portuguese vassals. &quot;Sobas&quot; were traditionally vassals of the ruler of Ndongo, and provided as tribute the valuable provisions, soldiers, and slaves needed to control Angola – thus, by making the &quot;sobas&quot; vassals of Portugal, the Portuguese were able to undermine Nzinga&#x27;s position as queen of Ndongo.

To weaken the Portuguese colonial administration, Nzinga dispatched messengers (&quot;makunzes&quot;) to encourage Mbande slaves to flee Portuguese plantations and join her kingdom, thereby depriving the colony of its income and manpower. When the Portuguese complained about the escapes, Nzinga replied that she would abide by her earlier treaty and return escaped slaves, but that her kingdom had none. Her actions were a success and many &quot;sobas&quot; joined forces with her, strengthening her position and causing the Portuguese to fear a Mbande uprising was imminent.

Despite these successes, Nzinga&#x27;s policies threatened the income of the Portuguese and Mbande nobles, and soon the Portuguese began to foment rebellion in her kingdom. In late 1625, the Portuguese sent soldiers to protect Hari a Kiluanje, a &quot;soba&quot; who had broken ties with Nzinga. Kiluanje opposed having a woman rule Ndongo, and was himself descended from the royal family; upon learning of his actions, Nzinga sent warriors to crush his revolt but was defeated, weakening her position and convincing more nobles to revolt. Nzinga petitioned the Portuguese to stop supporting Kiluanje, and attempted to negotiate as long as possible while she gathered more forces, but the Portuguese guessed this was a delaying tactic and soon recognized Kiluanje as king of Ndongo. The Portuguese subsequently declared war on Nzinga on 15 March 1626.

=== War with the Portuguese ===

Facing a Portuguese invasion, Nzinga gathered her army and withdrew to a group of islands in the Kwanza river. After a series of battles, she was defeated and forced to make a long march into eastern Ndongo; during the retreat, she was forced to abandon most of her followers, a strategy that greatly benefited her as the Portuguese were more interested in re-capturing slaves than in pursuing her army. The Portuguese soon suffered their own setback when Hari a Kiluanje died of smallpox, forcing them to replace him as king with Ngola Hari, another Ndongan nobleman. Ngola Hari proved to be an unpopular leader with the Ndongan people, who viewed him as a Portuguese puppet, while some &quot;sobas&quot; supported his rule. A divide soon formed inside the kingdom of Ndongo in which the common people and lesser nobles supported Nzinga, while many powerful nobles supported Ngola Hari and the Portuguese.

In November 1627, Nzinga again attempted to negotiate with the Portuguese, sending a peace delegation and a gift of 400 slaves. She indicated that she was willing to become a vassal of the kingdom of Portugal and pay tribute if they supported her claim to the throne, but was adamant that she was the rightful queen of Ndongo. The Portuguese, however, rejected the offer, beheading her lead diplomat and issuing the counter demand that she retire from public life, renounce her claim to the kingdom of Ndongo, and submit to Ngola Hari as rightful king—these demands were within the diplomatic norm in Europe, but were utterly unacceptable to Nzinga. Faced with the Portuguese rebuke and the realization that many Ndongan nobles stood against her, Nzinga (as had her father and brother) slipped into depression, locking herself in a room for several weeks. She emerged, however, and within a month had begun a new campaign to rebuild her alliances in Ndongo.

While rebuilding her strength, Nzinga took advantage of Ngola Hari&#x27;s political weakness, highlighting his lack of political experience. Ngola Hari was despised by both his nobles and his Portuguese allies, for while previous kings of Ndongo had all been warriors, Ngola Hari had no soldiers of his own and was forced to rely on Portuguese soldiers. Ngola Hari and the Portuguese launched a counter-propaganda campaign against Nzinga, hoping to use her gender as a means to delegitimize her strength, but this backfired as she increasingly outmaneuvered Ngola Hari in Ndongan politics. In one notable incident, Nzinga sent Ngola Hari threatening letters and a collection of fetishes, challenging him to combat with her forces; the messages terrified Hari, who was forced to call on his Portuguese allies for support, thus greatly diminishing his own prestige while adding to Nzinga&#x27;s reputation. However, she was still unable to directly face the Portuguese in battle, and was forced to retreat from the advancing Portuguese army. She suffered a series of military defeats, most notably in a Portuguese ambush that saw half of her army, most of her officials, and her two sisters captured, though she herself was able to escape. By late 1628, Nzinga&#x27;s army had been greatly reduced (down to around 200 soldiers according to one source) and she had been effectively expelled from her kingdom.

=== Conquest of Matamba ===
Following her expulsion, Nzinga and her supporters continued to fight against the Portuguese. To bolster her forces, the queen looked to make allies in the region while keeping her battered forces out of reach of the Portuguese army. During this time she was contacted by Kasanje, a powerful Imbangala warlord who had established his own kingdom on the Kwanza river. Kasanje and the Imbangala were traditional enemies of Ndongo, and Kasanje himself had previously executed several of Nzinga&#x27;s envoys. Kasanje offered Nzinga an alliance and military support, but in return demanded that she marry him and discard her &quot;lunga&quot; (a large bell used by Ndongan war captains as a symbol of their power). Nzinga accepted these terms, married Kasanje and was inducted into Imbangala society. The exiled queen adapted quickly to the new culture, adopting many Imbangala religious rites. Sources (African, Western, modern, contemporary) disagree on the intricacies and extent of Imbangala rites and laws (&quot;ijila&quot;), but the general consensus is that Nzinga was compelled to participate in the customary cannibalistic (the drinking of human blood in the &quot;cuia&quot;, or blood oath ceremony) and infanticidal (through the use of an oil made from a slain infant, the &quot;maji a samba&quot;) initiation rites required for a woman to become a leader in the highly militarized Imbangala society. The ritual was in part to prevent a succession crisis amongst the Imbangala in the future. She did not, however, completely abandon her Mbundan cultural roots, instead combining the beliefs of her people with those of her new Imbangalan allies. As noted by historian Linda Heywood, Nzinga&#x27;s genius was to combine her Mbundu heritage with the Imbangalan&#x27;s Central African military tradition and leadership structure, thus forming a new, highly capable army. To increase her numbers, she granted freedom to escaped slaves and land, new slaves, and titles to other exiled Ndongans. According to some sources, Nzinga – having been disenfranchised by the Mbundu-dominated nobility of Ndongo – was politically attracted to the Imbangalans, who placed more value on merit and religious fervor as opposed to lineage, kinship (and by extension, sex).

Using her new power base, Nzinga remodeled her forces after the highly effective Imbangala warriors. By 1631 she had rebuilt her army and was waging a successful guerilla war against the Portuguese, with one Jesuit priest (living in the Kongo at the time) describing her as being akin to an Amazon queen and praising her leadership. Between 1631 and 1635, Nzingha invaded the neighboring Kingdom of Matamba, capturing and deposing Queen in 1631. Nzingha had the defeated queen branded but spared her life (Imbangala custom mandated she execute her) and took Mwongo&#x27;s daughter into her service as one of her warriors. Having defeated the Matambans, Nzinga assumed the throne of Matamba and began settling the region with exiled Ndongans, hoping to use the kingdom as a base to wage her war to reclaim her homeland. Unlike her native Ndongo, Matamba had a cultural tradition of female leadership, giving Nzinga a more stable power base after she overthrew the previous queen. With Matamba under her control, Nzinga worked extensively to expand the slave trade in her new kingdom, using the profits from slave trading to finance her wars and divert trade income away from the Portuguese. Over the next decade, Nzinga continued to struggle against the Portuguese and their allies, with both sides attempting to limit each other&#x27;s influence and take control over the slave trade. During this decade, Nzinga took on more masculine traits, adopting male titles and clothing. She established an all-female bodyguard for herself, and ordered that her male concubines wear women&#x27;s clothing and address her as king. She also instituted communal sleeping quarters at her court, and enforced strict chastity rules for her male councilors and female bodyguards.

=== Expansion and Dutch alliance ===
By the late 1630s, Nzinga had expanded her influence to the north and south of Matamba. Using her forces, she cut other rulers off from the Portuguese-controlled coast, capturing parts of the Kwango River and bringing the region&#x27;s key slave supplying lands under her control. She also expanded her territory to the north, and in doing so established diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of the Kongo and Dutch merchants, who were increasingly active in the area. Nzinga also established a lucrative slave trade with the Dutch, who purchased as many as 13,000 slaves per year from Nzinga&#x27;s kingdom. She continued to occasionally send peace overtures to the Portuguese, even suggesting a military alliance with them, but only if they supported her return to Ndongo. She also refused to be re-admitted to the Christian faith, which became a point of contention between the two parties.

In 1641, forces from the Dutch West India Company, working in alliance with the Kingdom of Kongo, seized Luanda, driving out the Portuguese and setting up the directorate of Loango-Angola. The fall of Luanda was a major blow to the Portuguese, and Nzinga quickly dispatched an embassy to the Dutch-controlled city. Hoping to form an Afro-Dutch coalition against the Portuguese, Nzinga requested an immediate alliance and offered to open the slave trade to them, though she was concerned that the Kingdom of Kongo (her people&#x27;s traditional northern rivals) was growing too powerful. The Dutch accepted her offer of an alliance and sent their own ambassador and soldiers (some of whom brought their wives) to her court, soon assisting her in her fight against the Portuguese. Having lost large amounts of territory and forced to retreat to Massangano, the Portuguese governor attempted to make peace with Nzinga, but she refused these overtures. Nzingha moved her capital to Kavanga, in the northern part of Ndongo&#x27;s former domains. The capture of Luanda also left Nzingha&#x27;s kingdom as the pre-eminent, if temporary, slave-trading power in the region, allowing for her to build a sizeable war-camp (&quot;kilombo&quot;) of 80,000 (a figure which included non-combatants) members, including mercenaries, escaped slaves, allies, and her own soldiers.

Using the large size of her army, her new wealth and her famous reputation, Nzinga was able to reclaim large parts of Ndongo from 1641 to 1644. However, her expansionism caused alarm amongst other African kingdoms; in one infamous incident, she invaded the Wandu region of Kongo, which had been in revolt against the Kongolese king. Though these lands had never been part of Ndongo, Nzinga refused to withdraw and added the conquest to her kingdom, an act which greatly offended the Kongolese king, Garcia II. The Dutch, hoping to preserve their alliance with both Kongo and Nzinga, brokered a peace, but relations between Nzinga and other regional leaders remained strained. In addition, her former husband and ally, Kasanje, feared her growing power in the region and formed a coalition of Imbangala leaders against Nzinga, invading her lands in Matamba (though they made little progress). By the mid-1640s, her successes had won her the support of many Ndongan nobles. With the nobility flocking to her side, Nzingha was able to collect more tribute (in the form of slaves) which she in turn sold to the Dutch in exchange for firearms, thereby increasing her military and economic power; by 1644, she considered Garcia II of the Kongo to be her only political equal in the region, while the Portuguese viewed her as their most potent adversary in Africa.

In 1644, Nzinga defeated the Portuguese army at the Battle of Ngoleme. Then, in 1646, she was defeated by the Portuguese at the Battle of Kavanga and, in the process, her sister Kambu was recaptured, along with her archives, which revealed her alliance with Kongo. These archives also showed that her captive sister, Funji, had been in secret correspondence with Nzinga and had revealed coveted Portuguese plans to her. As a result of the woman&#x27;s spying, the Portuguese reputedly drowned the sister in the Kwanza River. The Dutch in Luanda sent Nzinga reinforcements, and with their help, Nzinga routed a Portuguese army in 1647 at the Battle of Kombi. Nzinga then laid siege to the Portuguese capital of Massangano, isolating the Portuguese there; by 1648, Nzingha controlled much of her former kingdom, while her control over the slave trade increased the economic power of Matamba.

Despite these successes, the allies&#x27; control over Angola remained tenuous. Lacking artillery, Nzinga was unable to effectively break the Portuguese defenses at Massangano, while political infighting and developments in Europe weakened the Dutch forces in Angola. In August 1648 a Portuguese expedition, led by newly appointed governor Salvador Correia de Sá, besieged Luanda. After suffering through a major Portuguese bombardment, on 24 August 1648 the Dutch commander sued for peace with the Portuguese and agreed to evacuate Angola. When Nzinga&#x27;s army and the remaining Dutch forces arrived outside Luanda, the peace between Dutch and Portuguese was signed, and unbeknownst to Nzinga, the Dutch forces sailed for Europe. Faced with a bolstered Portuguese garrison, Nzinga and her forces retreated to Matamba. Unlike previous decades however, after 1648 Nzinga concentrated her efforts on preventing a Portuguese push inland (as opposed to trying to re-conquer Ndongan territory), disrupting their soldiers and fomenting wars between smaller tribes and kingdoms.

==Later years==

=== Last campaigns ===
While her wars against the Portuguese and their allies continued, Nzingha created alliances with neighboring kingdoms, expanding her influence even as she aged. She sent soldiers to enforce her rule over local noblemen, dispatched forces to fight against Kasanje&#x27;s Imbangalans in eastern Matamba, and fought against the Kingdom of Kaka in the Congo. She also used her army as a political tool, using its influence to sway the outcomes of succession disputes in her favor.

=== On Christianity ===
Throughout the 1640s and 1650s, Nzinga began to tentatively adopt Christian cultural traditions, following her conversion to the faith in 1623. This began in 1644 when her army captured a Portuguese priest, and expanded when her forces in Kongo captured two Spanish Capuchins in 1648; unlike other European prisoners, the queen granted missionaries extended freedoms in her war camp. One of the Spaniards, Father Calisto Zelotes do Reis Mago, would go on to become a longtime resident at her court and her personal secretary. Whereas previous missionaries (either parish priests or Jesuits) had been strongly affiliated with the Portuguese and their colonial administration, the Spanish Capuchins were more sympathetic to Nzinga&#x27;s positions. During the early 1650s, Nzinga sent requests to the Capuchin order for more missionaries and for support against the Portuguese – effectively turning the missionaries into de facto diplomats between her and the Vatican. She pursued closer relations with Catholic leaders in Europe for the rest of her life, even receiving correspondence from Pope Alexander VII in 1661 praising her efforts.

In addition to using Christianity as a diplomatic tool, Nzinga adopted Christian customs into her court. From the 1650s onward, she increasingly relied on Christian converts at her court. Just as she had done with the Imbangalan culture several decades before, Nzinga appropriated aspects of Christian ideology and culture, adding these to her existing court traditions to create a new class of Christian councilors loyal to her. She also began practicing Catholic-inspired rituals, placed crosses in places of high honor in her court, and built many churches across her kingdom.

Nzinga&#x27;s efforts to convert her people was not without controversy, and some conservative religious figures pushed back against her policies. In response, Nzinga empowered her Christian priests to burn the temples and shrines of practitioners who opposed her, and ordered that they be arrested and turned over to her for trial. Traditionalists were dismissed from her court, after which she sentenced them to public whippings. Several prominent Mdundu and Imbangala priests were sold as slaves to the Portuguese, with Nzinga personally asking that they be shipped overseas; profits of the sale were then used to furnish a new church. Some of the wanted priests, however, escaped Nzinga&#x27;s purge and went into hiding, later working to undermine her legitimacy as queen.

=== Peace with Portugal ===
By 1650 the kingdoms of Matamba and Portugal had been at war for nearly 25 years, with both sides having become exhausted. Tentative peace talks between Nzingha and the Portuguese began in 1651, continued in 1654, and culminated in 1656. The negotiations were aided by Nzingha&#x27;s recent conversion to Christianity and by the pressure Portugal was facing from its war of Independence against Spain. The Portuguese hoped to end the expensive war in Angola and re-open the slave trade, while Nzingha – increasingly cognizant of her age – hoped to have her sister Kambu (often referred to by her Christian name, Barbara, during this period) released. She would not, however, pay the ransom the Portuguese demanded for her sister, and so negotiations repeatedly stalled.

Despite difficulties, a peace treaty was signed between Nzingha and the Portuguese in late 1656. Under the term of the peace treaty, Nzingha agreed to cede lands on her kingdom&#x27;s western coast to Portugal, with the Lucala River becoming the new border between Portuguese Angola and Matamba. In return, Portugal ceded the Kituxela region to her. Nzingha also agreed to allow Portuguese traders inside Matamba, while they agreed to intervene if Kasanje or Nogla Hari attacked her. The Portuguese agreed to concentrate the slave trade in a market in her capital (effectively giving her a monopoly on the slave trade) and send a permanent representative to her court. In return, Nzingha agreed to provide military assistance to the Portuguese and allowed for missionaries to reside in her kingdom. A final provision asking that Matamba pay Portugal tribute was proposed, but never ratified. While several sources describe the treaty as making concessions to Portugal, others note that her recognition as a ruler by Portugal gained Nzingha legitimacy and political stability. On 12 October Nzingha&#x27;s sister arrived at Nzingha&#x27;s court in Matamba in a procession led by Father Ignazio de Valassina. Upon Kambu&#x27;s arrival to Matamba the terms of peace were officially agreed upon, and as was tradition Nzingha and her officials clapped their hands letting the Portuguese know that peace terms were accepted.

=== Final years ===
After the wars with Portugal ended, Nzingha attempted to rebuild her kingdom. As noted by Linda Heywood, Nzingha&#x27;s final years were spent establishing a unified kingdom she could pass on to her sister. However, her native Ndongo had been ravaged by decades of war, with wide swathes of the land left depopulated; as such, Nzingha focused her efforts on strengthening Matamba. She developed Matamba as a trading power by capitalizing on its strategic position as the gateway to the Central African interior, strengthening her hold on the slave trade. She resettled former slaves on new land and allowed women in her war camp to bear children, which had been banned under the wartime Imbangala customs. She also reformed the legal code of her kingdom and established contact with Christian rulers in Europe, hoping to certify Matamba&#x27;s status as an internationally recognized Christian kingdom.

Peace caused major changes at Nzingha&#x27;s royal court. Whereas in wartime she had adopted the masculine dress and mannerisms of an Imbangala warlord, in the postwar era Nzingha&#x27;s court became more feminine; she adopted new fashions in court, imported silk and goods from Europe, placed renewed focus on education (replacing military drills) and abolished concubinage, eventually marrying her favorite concubine in a Christian ceremony. Nzingha – wary of a potential succession crisis – also worked to increase the power of the royal family in Ndongo. She distanced herself from the Imbangalan culture and abolished many of the democratic and meritocratic policies she had tolerated in wartime, seeing them as a threat to the monarchy. During her later reign, divides opened in her court between educated Christian converts who supported her royalist policies and traditionalist Imbangalans and Mbundus, who supported a return to the more militaristic, meritocratic policies of the past.

=== Death and succession ===
During the 1660s (specifically after a period of serious illness in 1657) Nzinga grew increasingly concerned about who would succeed her as ruler of Ndongo and Matamba. She feared that her death would lead to a succession crisis, which would cause her Christian conversions to be undone, and spark renewed Portuguese aggression. To ensure the transition would be smooth, she appointed her sister Kambu as her heir, forgoing any of the traditional Mbundu elections. However, she grew increasingly concerned that her sister&#x27;s husband, Nzinga a Mona, was growing too powerful. Nzinga a Mona was a skilled soldier who was raised in the Imbangala tradition, and while he had been a lifelong soldier in Nzingha&#x27;s army, in his older age he increasingly came into conflict with Nzinga. She feared that Nzinga Mona&#x27;s adherence to Imbangala tradition would destabilize the new, Christian kingdom she had established.

In October 1663, Nzinga fell ill with infection in her throat and became bedridden. By December of that year the infection had spread to her lungs, and Nzinga died in her sleep on the morning of 17 December. She was buried with great aplomb in accordance with Catholic and Mbundu traditions. Ceremonies were held across Matamba and in Luanda, where both the Portuguese and Mbundu populations held services in her honor.

Following Nzinga&#x27;s death, her sister Kambu (more commonly known as Barbara or Dona Barbara) assumed the throne.

== Historical portrayal ==
A powerful queen who reigned for over thirty years, Nzinga has been the subject of many works.

=== Angolan ===
In her native Angola, oral traditions celebrating Nzinga&#x27;s life began immediately after her death. Though her kingdoms would eventually be incorporated into Portuguese Angola, commemoration of Nzinga and her achievements persisted. In the mid-20th century, Nzinga became a powerful symbol of Angolan resistance against Portugal during the Angolan War of Independence. Nzinga&#x27;s legacy would outlast the Angolan Civil War and remains an area of interest in the country.

=== Portuguese ===
The Portuguese, Nzinga&#x27;s longtime rivals, wrote a number of works relating to her life. The first biography of Nzinga was published by Antonio da Gaeta (a Capuchin priest who had lived in her court) in 1669; Gaeta&#x27;s work praised Nzinga&#x27;s diplomatic skills and compared her to famous women from antiquity, but also pointedly noted that she had ultimately been persuaded by divine providence to accept Christianity. Antonio Cavazzi (another Capuchin who had resided in Nzinga&#x27;s court) wrote a biography of her in 1689, again noting her political skill, but also describing her as a queen who had ruined the land. Together, Gaeta and Cavazzi&#x27;s biographies became the primary sources for Nzinga&#x27;s life. Portuguese writers would continue to write about Nzinga into the 20th century, normally depicting her as a skilled, &quot;savage&quot; opponent who had ultimately been forced to submit to Portugal and accept Christianity.

=== Western ===
Numerous western authors have written about Nzinga. The first notable, non-Portuguese Western work mentioning Nzinga was written by French Jesuit Jean-Baptiste Labat in 1732. A heavily edited translation of Cavazzi&#x27;s earlier biography, Labat&#x27;s work formed the basis on which many Western sources would depict their image of Nzinga; whereas Portuguese sources focused on Nzinga&#x27;s capabilities as a leader and conversion to Christianity, Western sources in the 18th and 19th centuries tended to heavily focus on her sexuality, alleged cannibalism, and brutality. Jean-Louis Castilhon wrote a fictional story of her life in 1769, portraying her as cruel (but not a cannibal), while the Marquis de Sade wrote about Nzinga&#x27;s alleged cruelty and promiscuity in his 1795 work &quot;Philosophy in the Bedroom&quot;, in which he cites her as an example of a woman driven to evil by passion. Likewise, Laure Junot included Nzinga as a symbol of cruelty and lust in her &quot;Memoirs of Celebrated Women of All Countries&quot;, grouping her alongside women such as Lady Jane Grey, Marie Antoinette, and Catherine I. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was also critical of Nzinga&#x27;s (though he did not directly name her) &quot;female state&quot;, describing her kingdom as a barren, unfertile land that had eventually collapsed due to her usurping of the natural order.

Nzinga&#x27;s reputation in the West recovered significantly in the 20th century. Nzinga&#x27;s usage as a symbol in the Angolan War of Independence increased interest in her life, and authors began to take a more nuanced approach to her biography. American historian Joseph C. Miller published a widely cited essay on Nzinga in the 1975 &quot;The Journal of African History&quot;, highlighting her struggles and innovations but also criticizing her autocratic methods. Afro-Cuban poet Georgina Herrera published a 1978 poem extolling Nzinga&#x27;s wisdom and connecting her culturally with Afro-Caribbeans in the Americas. American feminist author Aurora Levins Morales wrote about Nzinga, praising her anti-colonial and anti-patriarchal struggles but also criticizing her status as a ruling elite and her propagation of the slave trade. In his writings on Nzinga, American historian John Thornton focused on her lifelong struggle to establish her authority over the Mbundu culture, noting that her legendary reputation and actions helped to establish a wider Atlantic Creole culture. American historian Linda Heywood wrote an extensive biography of Nzinga in 2017, featuring much of her life and describing her as a great historical figure. Heywood cautioned against portraying Nzinga as either a populist hero or tyrant, noting instead that she should be viewed as a complicated individual who used culture, diplomacy, religion and war to secure her kingdom.

=== Legendary accounts ===
One legend (having no proof) records that Nzinga executed her lovers. She kept 50–60 men dressed as women, according to Dapper&#x27;s &quot;Description of Africa,&quot; as her harem, and she had them fight to the death for the privilege and duty of spending the night with her. In the morning, the winner was put to death.

According to an account by the Capuchin priest Cavazzi, Nzinga maintained her strength well into her later years. Upon witnessing her during a military review in 1662 (the year prior to her death), Cavazzi praised her agility, to which the elder queen replied that, in her youth, she was able to wound any Imbangala warrior, and that she would have stood against 25 armed men – unless they had muskets.

==Legacy==

Today, she is remembered in Angola as the Mother of Angola, the fighter of negotiations, and the protector of her people. She is still honored throughout Africa as a remarkable leader and woman, for her political and diplomatic acumen, as well as her brilliant military tactics. Accounts of her life are often romanticized, and she is considered a symbol of the fight against oppression. 

Nzingha ultimately managed to shape her state into a form that tolerated her authority, though surely the fact that she survived all attacks on her and built up a strong base of loyal supporters helped as much as the relevance of the precedents she cited. While Njinga had obviously not overcome the idea that females could not rule in Ndongo during her lifetime, and had to &#x27;become a male&#x27; to retain power, her female successors faced little problem in being accepted as rulers. The clever use of her gender and her political understandings helped lay a foundation for future leaders of Ndongo today. In the period of 104 years that followed Njinga&#x27;s death in 1663, queens ruled for at least eighty of them. Nzingha is a leadership role model for all generations of Angolan women. Women in Angola today display remarkable social independence and are found in the country&#x27;s army, police force, government, and public and private economic sectors. Nzingha was embraced as a symbol of the People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola during civil war.

A major street in Luanda is named after her, and a statue of her was placed in Kinaxixi on an impressive square in 2002, dedicated by President Santos to celebrate the 27th anniversary of independence. The statue was praised by historian Scholastique Dianzinga for increasing the rperesentation of women on public monuments. Angolan women are often married near the statue, especially on Thursdays and Fridays. 

On 23 December 2014, the National Reserve Bank of Angola (BNA) issued a 20 Kwanza coin in tribute to Nzingha &quot;in recognition of her role to defend self-determination and cultural identity of her people.&quot;

An Angolan film, &quot;&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;Njinga, Rainha de Angola&quot;), was released in 2013.

A Starz series, &quot;Queen Nzinga&quot;, is in development with Yetide Badaki as the titular character and 50 Cent, Steven S. DeKnight and Mo Abundu as producers.

Nzinga (referred to as Nzinga Mbande) leads the Kongolese civilization in the 2016 4X video game &quot;Civilization VI&quot;, since the release of &quot;Great Negotiators&quot; on 21 November 2022, as part of the DLC &quot;Leader Pass&quot;.

The 2023 Netflix docudrama &quot;African Queens: Njinga&quot; chronicles her life, dramatized through historical reenactment.

Nzinga is one of Africa&#x27;s best documented early-modern rulers. About a dozen of her own letters are known (all but one published in Brásio, &quot;Monumenta&quot; volumes 6–11 and 15 passim). In addition, her early years are well described in the correspondence of Portuguese governor Fernão de Sousa, who was in the colony from 1624 to 1631 (published by Heintze). Her later activities are documented by the Portuguese chronicler António de Oliveira de Cadornega, and by two Italian Capuchin priests, Giovanni Cavazzi da Montecuccolo and Antonio Gaeta da Napoli, who resided in her court from 1658 until her death (Cavazzi presided at her funeral). Cavazzi included a number of watercolours in his manuscript which include Njinga as a central figure, as well as himself. However, Cavazzi&#x27;s account is peppered with a number of pejorative statements about Nzinga for which he does not offer factual evidence, such as her cannibalism.

<doc id="419493" wikidata="Q3153397" url="?curid=419493" title="Towersey">
<text>Towersey is a village and civil parish about east of Thame in Oxfordshire. Towersey was part of Buckinghamshire until 1933, when the county boundary was moved and Towersey was exchanged for Kingsey. The 2011 Census recorded Towersey parish&#x27;s population as 433.

==Toponym==
The toponym &quot;Towersey&quot; is derived from Old and Middle English. The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as simply &quot;Eia&quot;, meaning &quot;island&quot;. This refers to a dry area of land in the marshes of the Aylesbury Vale, on the edge of which the village stands. A manuscript of 1174 records Kingsey also as simply &quot;Eya&quot;, but thereafter both toponyms gained prefixes to distinguish the two villages. A manuscript of 1194 refers to &quot;Kingseie&quot;, which has evolved into &quot;Kingsey&quot;. Mid-13th-century records refer to &quot;Turrisey&quot; and &quot;Tureseye&quot;, which has evolved into &quot;Towersey&quot;. It means &quot;island of de Turs&quot;, referring to Richard de Turs, who held the manor from 1252.

==Parish church==
The earliest part of the Church of England parish church of Saint Catherine is its 13th-century Early English Gothic chancel. The nave was rebuilt early in the 14th century and is Decorated Gothic. In 1850–54 the church was restored under the direction of the architect James Cranston, who added the bell tower in its slightly unusual position on the south side of the nave. The tower has a ring of four bells. Ellis I Knight of Reading, Berkshire cast the second, third and tenor bells in 1627. Richard Keene of Woodstock cast the treble bell in 1695. St Catherine&#x27;s also has a Sanctus bell that Keene cast in 1699. St Catherine&#x27;s is now one of eight parishes in the Benefice of Thame.

==Railway==

In 1859 the Wycombe Railway began to be extended through Towersey parish from to . crossing Chinnor Road on a bridge just south of the village. The line opened in 1862. 

In 1864 the line was extended again from Thame to . Thame was the nearest station until 1933, when the Great Western Railway opened on the west side of the bridge. British Railways withdrew passenger services in January 1963 and freight services to Thame in 1991. The track has since been lifted. The former railway bridge with its steel span over Chinnor Road survives. The trackbed has been converted into the Phoenix Trail for cycling, horseriding and walking between Princes Risborough and Thame.

==Amenities==

Towersey has a public house, the Three Horseshoes. The village is the setting for the Towersey Village Festival which is a festival of folk music and dance. It was founded in 1965 and is held annually on August bank holiday weekend. Its foundation was followed by the foundation in 1966 of a Cotswold Morris side, Towersey Morris, which still performs today.

<text>Brian Joseph Michael Cotter, Baron Cotter (24 August 1936 – 14 November 2023), was a British Liberal Democrat politician. He was Member of Parliament for Weston-super-Mare from 1997 to 2005, and subsequently a member of the House of Lords from 2006 until his death.

==Background and career==
Born in Ealing, the son of a doctor from Weston-super-Mare, Cotter was educated at Saint Benedict&#x27;s School, Ealing, and Downside School in Somerset, where, aged sixteen, he ran a 4½ minute mile. Upon leaving school, he entered the British Army, serving two years National Service, spending time stationed in West Germany. He entered business after leaving the army. He studied Business Studies at a polytechnic in London, eventually running his own small manufacturing company, Plasticable Ltd in Alton, which is now run as a co-operative.

Formerly a Conservative before joining the Liberals in 1983, during the Liberal/SDP Alliance, Cotter was elected to Woking Borough Council in 1986, representing the Mount Hermon West ward. He retained this seat until standing down in 1990. 

==Parliamentary career==
After unsuccessfully contesting the seat in 1992, Cotter was elected the Liberal Democrat MP Member of Parliament for Weston-super-Mare in 1997. This was the first time the constituency had not returned a Conservative MP since 1923. He was re-elected in 2001, but lost the seat to John Penrose of the Conservatives at the 2005 general election. Throughout his time in Parliament, he served as the Liberal Democrat spokesman for small business.

In April 2006, it was announced that Cotter would be created a life peer to join the Liberal Democrat ranks in the House of Lords, and on 30 May he was created Baron Cotter, of Congresbury in the County of Somerset. He delivered his maiden speech in the Lords on 29 June.

Cotter took an interest in a number of areas, and on various issues as they arose. Specifically, before the coalition government was formed in 2010, he led for the Liberal Democrats on Small Business issues and vocational education; specifically apprenticeships. Within the coalition, he concentrated on business and vocational training issues.

==Personal life==
Lord Cotter was a practising Roman Catholic. Cotter was a patron of domestic violence charity the ManKind Initiative.

Cotter married Eyleen Patricia Wade in February 1963. They had two sons and a daughter. Lord Cotter died from complications of dementia on 14 November 2023, at the age of 87.

<text>The oka, okka, or oke () was an Ottoman measure of mass, equal to 400 dirhems (Ottoman drams). Its value varied, but it was standardized in the late empire as 1.2829 kilograms. &#x27;Oka&#x27; is the most usual spelling today; &#x27;oke&#x27; was the usual contemporary English spelling; &#x27;okka&#x27; is the modern Turkish spelling, and is usually used in academic work about the Ottoman Empire.

In Albania, oka varied in weight between 1.25 kg (small oka) and 1.408 kg (large oka) depending on the region. It was formally replaced by the metric system in 1922 but continued to be used until a comprehensive implementation of the metric system in 1946.

In Turkey, the traditional unit is now called the &quot;eski okka&quot; &#x27;old oka&#x27; or &quot;kara okka&quot; &#x27;black okka&#x27;; the &quot;yeni okka&quot; &#x27;new okka&#x27; is the kilogram.

In Greece, the oka (, plural ) was standardized at 1.282 kg and remained in use until traditional units were abolished on March 31, 1953—the metric system had been adopted in 1876, but the older units remained in use. 

In Cyprus, the oka was equal to 1.270058636 kg or 4 onjas, each weighing 100 drams, and it remained in use until 1986, when Cyprus adopted the metric system.

In Egypt, the monetary oka weighted 1.23536 kg. In Tripolitania, it weighed 1.2208 kg, equal to 2½ artals.

The oka was also used as a unit of volume. In Wallachia, it was 1.283 liters of liquid and 1.537 L of grain (dry measure). In Greece, an oka of oil was 1.280 kg, which would have translated to about 1.340 litres (at 0.916 kg/l).

<text>Wilbur Wright Field was a military installation and an airfield used as a World War I pilot, mechanic, and armorer training facility and, under different designations, conducted United States Army Air Corps and Air Forces flight testing. Located near Riverside, Ohio, the site is officially &quot;Area B&quot; of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and includes the National Museum of the United States Air Force built on the airfield.

==History==

===World War I===
Wilbur Wright Field was established in 1917 for World War I on of land adjacent to the Mad River which included the 1910 Wright Brothers&#x27; Huffman Prairie Flying Field and that was leased to the Army by the Miami Conservancy District. Logistics support to Wilbur Wright Field was by the adjacent Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot established in January 1918 and which also supplied three other Midwest Signal Corps aviation schools. A Signal Corps Aviation School began in June 1917 for providing combat pilots to the Western Front in France, and the field housed an aviation mechanic&#x27;s school and an armorer&#x27;s school. On 19 June 1918, Lt. Frank Stuart Patterson at the airfield was testing machine gun/propeller synchronization when a tie rod failure broke the wings off his Airco DH.4M while diving from . Also in 1918, McCook Field near Dayton between Keowee Street and the Great Miami River began using space and mechanics at Wilbur Wright Field. Following World War I, the training school at Wilbur Wright Field was discontinued.

===Inter-war years===
1923 records for speed, distance, and endurance were set by an April 16 Fokker T-2 flight from Wilbur Wright Field which used a course around the water tower, the McCook Field water tower, and a pylon placed at New Carlisle. In June 1923, an Air Service TC-1 airship &quot;was wrecked in a storm at Wilbur Wright Field&quot; and by 1924, the field had &quot;an interlock system&quot; radio beacon using Morse code command guidance (dash-dot &quot;N&quot; for port, dot-dash &quot;A&quot; for starboard) illuminating instrument board lights. The Field Service Section at Wilbur Wright Field merged with McCook&#x27;s Engineering Division to form the Materiel Division on 15 October 1926 (&quot;moved to Wright Field when McCook Field closed in 1927&quot;). The Air Service&#x27;s &quot;control station for the model airway&quot;—which scheduled military flights of the Airways Section—moved to Wilbur Wright Field from McCook Field in the late 1920s (originally &quot;at Bolling Field until 1925&quot;).

===Redesignations===
The Fairfield Air Depot formed when the leased area of Wilbur Wright Field and the Army-owned land of the Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot merged soon after World War I. For an aerial war game of 1929, &quot;Fairfield&quot; was the headquarters of the Blue air force: a Blue &quot;airdrome north of Dayton at Troy&quot; was strafed on May 16 (&quot;a raid on the airdrome at Fairfield&quot; was later expected), &quot;Dayton&quot; was the May 21 take off site for a round-trip bomber attack on New York, and &quot;target areas at Fairfield&quot; were used for live bombing on May 25. A provisional division was &quot;assembled at Dayton&quot; on May 16, 1931, for maneuvers in which &quot;Maj. Henry H. Arnold, division G-4 (Supply), had stocks at Pittsburgh; Cleveland; Buffalo; Middletown, Pennsylvania; Aberdeen, Maryland; and Bolling Field to service units as they flew eastward.&quot; The depot remained active until 1946.

=== Wright Field ===
In 1924, the city of Dayton purchased , the portion of Fairfield Air Depot leased in 1917 for Wilbur Wright Field, along with an additional in Montgomery County to the southwest (now part of Riverside). The combined area was named Wright Field to honor both Wright Brothers. A new installation with permanent brick facilities was constructed to replace McCook Field and was dedicated on October 12, 1927. The transfer of 4,500 tons of engineering material, office equipment and other assets at McCook Field to Wright Field began on March 25, 1927, and was 85% complete by June 1 after moving 1,859 truckloads. &quot;The Engineering School shut down for the school year 1927-28 at Wright Field, which had the Army Air Corps Museum in Building 12.

By November 1930, &quot;the laboratory at Wright Field&quot; had planes fitted as flying laboratories&quot; (e.g., B-19 &quot;flying laboratory&quot; with &quot;8-foot tires&quot;), and the equipment of the 1929 Full Flight Laboratory (closed out by the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics, which had established the principle of safe fog flying) was moved to Wright Field by the end of 1931. Materiel Division’s Fog Flying Unit under 1st Lt. Albert F. Hegenberger used the equipment for blind landings.

===Patterson Field===
Patterson Field named for Frank Stuart Patterson was designated on 6 July 1931 as the area of Wright Field east of Huffman Dam (including Fairfield Air Depot, Huffman Prairie, and Wright Field&#x27;s airfield). Patterson Field became the location of the Materiel Division of the Air Corps and a key logistics center and in 1935, quarters were built at Patterson Field which in 1939 still &quot;was without runways...heavier aircraft met difficulty in landing in inclement weather.&quot; Wright Field retained the land west of the Huffman Dam and became the research and development center of the Air Corps.

===Pre-war events===
Engineering and flight activities of the two installations after the designation of Patterson Field included numerous aviation achievements and failures prior to the bombing of Pearl Harbor:
===AAF and USAF base===
The Army Air Forces Technical Base was formed on December 15, 1945, when Wright Field, Patterson Field, Dayton Army Air Field in Vandalia and Clinton County AAF in Wilmington merged. After the USAF was created, the base was renamed Air Force Technical Base in December 1947 and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in January 1948.. The former Wright Field became Area B of the combined installation, the southern portion of Patterson Field became Area A, and the northern portion of Patterson Field, including the jet runway built in 1946–47, Area C.

<doc id="419507" wikidata="Q337742" url="?curid=419507" title="James Cran">
<text>James Douglas Cran (28 January 1944 – 1 June 2023) was a British Conservative Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Beverley (1987–1997) and for Beverley and Holderness (1997–2005).

==Early life==
Cran went to Ruthrieston School in Aberdeen and became the school&#x27;s 1959 Dux Medallion winner. He studied at the University of Aberdeen, gaining an Honours MA. He was the National Winner of the 1968 Daily Mirror Speaking Trophy.

Cran was a researcher in the Conservative Research Department during 1970–71 and was a member of then-Leader of the Opposition Ted Heath&#x27;s briefing team during the 1970 general election. From 1971 to 1979, Cran was the Secretary and Chief Executive of the National Association of Pension Funds. He was the Northern Director for the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) from 1979 to 1984 and was the CBI&#x27;s West Midlands Director from 1984 to 1987. From 1974 to 1979, he was a councillor in the London Borough of Sutton, and served as Chairman of the Health and Housing Committee.

==Parliamentary career==
Cran became MP for Beverley in 1987 taking over from Sir Patrick Wall. In 1997 this constituency was abolished and Cran was elected to the successor constituency of Beverley and Holderness.

Cran was a member of the &#x27;92 Group of right-wing Conservative MPs and took an active part in the leadership contests involving John Major (June 1995), Michael Howard (1997) and the latter stages of William Hague&#x27;s campaign (1997). Cran was a consistent opponent of the Maastricht Treaty, and of the single currency and closer European integration.

Cran was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Patrick Mayhew from 1995 to 1996. He was present with the Secretary of State in Washington DC at the first meeting with Gerry Adams, then President of Sinn Féin. Cran was also Pairing Whip and then Assistant Chief Whip (1997–2001). He was appointed Shadow Deputy Leader of the House of Commons by then-Leader of the Opposition Iain Duncan-Smith but resigned shortly thereafter to pursue other activities. He was a member of a number of Select Committees: Trade and Industry (1987–92); Administration (1997–98); Selection (1998–2001); and Defence (2001–05). He was also a member of the Chairman of Ways and Means Panel (2001–05) and a member of the Council of Europe and the WEU (2001–02).

Other Parliamentary activities included: 
* Vice Chairman, Conservative Backbench Northern Ireland Committee (1992–95)
* Order of St John All Party Group (1994–95)
* Secretary, Conservative Backbench Committee on Constitutional Affairs (1989–91)
* European Affairs (1989–91) 
* All Party Anglo-Malta Group (1992–94) Co-founder
* Parliamentary Group on Occupational Pensions (1992)
* Member, Northern Ireland Grand Committee (1996–2001)
* Treasurer, European Research Group (1994–97)
* Member, &#x27;92 Group Steering Committee (2001–04)
* Council Member, Pension Trustees Forum (1992–95)
* Parliamentary Consultant, Lincoln National (UK) Plc (1994–98).

==Personal life and death==
Cran married Penelope Barbara Wilson of South Kensington in 1973 and they had one daughter, Alexandra. Penelope died in 2014. Cran&#x27;s dead body was discovered at his home in the village of Ashkirk on 1 June 2023. He was 79.

Following his death, James Cran&#x27;s daughter, Dr Alexandra Walker, alleged sustained emotional (and occasionally physical) abuse at his hands, beginning in her childhood and carrying on up until she broke off contact with him shortly before he died. Dr Walker described Cran as &quot;terrifying&quot;, a &quot;Jekyll and Hyde character&quot; prone to mood swings and sudden fits of rage exacerbated by alcohol. She recounted that he once locked her in a car for &quot;what felt like hours&quot; for accidentally hitting him with a skimming stone, and tied her arms down at a restaurant as a toddler for throwing a salt shaker, among various other incidents. Walker also felt that Cran consistently belittled her as an adult, and emotionally blackmailed her in the aftermath of her mother&#x27;s death.

Some personal artefacts associated with Cran were listed for sale by auction on 13 February 2025 by Eastbourne Auctions.

<doc id="419509" wikidata="Q2362263" url="?curid=419509" title="Archaeology and the Book of Mormon">
<text>The relationship between Archaeology and the Book of Mormon is based on the claims made by the Book of Mormon that the ancient Americas were populated by Old World immigrants and their corresponding material culture, a claim that can be verified or discredited by archeological investigations. The Book of Mormon claims to describe the dealings of two civilizations, called the Nephites and the Lamanites, who are believed by Mormons to have existed in the Americas from about 600 BC to about AD 400. A secondary storyline discusses the Jaredite nation, which the Book of Mormon describes as coming from the Old World shortly after the Biblical confounding of the languages at the Tower of Babel via a miraculous transoceanic voyage.
The material culture described in the Book of Mormon contains a combination of technological, agricultural, and archeological anachronisms that were ubiquitous during the early 19th century and entirely absent in the ancient Americas, constituting some of the most significant anachronisms in the Book of Mormon. Other anachronisms include linguistic, doctrinal, and political details that were not only missing in the ancient Americas but were also unique to the early 19th century. Critics claim that the narrative details in the book may point to a 19th century author, presumably Joseph Smith.

The orthodox view of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and other denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement believe the Book of Mormon describes ancient historical events in the Americas. The orthodox view remains dominant in the Latter Day Saint movement, though in recent decades, various individuals and groups have begun to describe the work as &quot;inspired&quot; rather than asserting the book to be literal account of history. For example, in 2007, the Community of Christ affirmed that the book was considered scripture, but that it did not mandate any degree of belief or use. As a result, a wide spectrum of belief exists within the group, ranging from individuals who believe in its historicity to those seeing it as inspired but not historical. A range of beliefs also exists between individuals in other groups.

Since the book&#x27;s publication in 1830, Mormon archaeologists have been trying to confirm the veracity of the narratives, but have repeatedly retreated from prior hypotheses to account for overwhelming archeological evidence. Some early-20th century Mormons claimed various archaeological findings, such as place names and ruins of the Inca, Maya, Olmec, and other ancient American and Old World civilizations, as giving credence to the Book of Mormon record. All such claims are dismissed by archeologists, oftentimes out-of-hand (a number of archaeological societies have a form letter response to Mormon inquiries about whether these civilizations are consistent with the Book of Mormon).

==Background==
The Book of Mormon narrative, together with supporting statements by Joseph Smith, his associates, and later LDS Church leaders, state that the Book of Mormon is a record of ancient Indigenous peoples of the Americas. The book affirms that the three groups or civilizations—the Nephites, the Lamanites, and the Jaredites—emigrated from the Old World between 2500 and 600 BC, and became ancestors of the continent&#x27;s indigenous peoples.

===Modern archaeology===

The Americas began to be populated when Paleolithic hunter-gatherers (Paleo-Indians) entered North America from the North Asian Mammoth steppe via the Beringia land bridge, which had formed between northeastern Siberia and western Alaska due to the lowering of sea level during the Last Glacial Maximum (26,000 to 19,000 years ago). These populations expanded south of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and spread rapidly southward, occupying both North and South America, by 12,000 to 14,000 years ago.

The precise date for the peopling of the Americas is a long-standing open question. While advances in archaeology and other fields have progressively shed more light on the subject, significant questions remain unresolved. The &quot;Clovis First theory&quot; refers to the hypothesis that the Clovis culture represents the earliest human presence in the Americas about 13,000 years ago. However, evidence of pre-Clovis cultures has accumulated and pushed back the possible date of the first peopling of the Americas. Academics generally believe that humans reached North America south of the Laurentide Ice Sheet at some point between 15,000 and 20,000 years ago. Some new controversial archaeological evidence suggests the possibility that human arrival in the Americas may have occurred prior to the Last Glacial Maximum more than 20,000 years ago. However, the archaeological sites in the Americas with the oldest dates that have gained broad acceptance are all compatible with an age of about 15,000 years. This includes the Buttermilk Creek Complex in Texas, the Meadowcroft Rockshelter site in Pennsylvania and the Monte Verde site in southern Chile. Archaeological evidence of pre-Clovis people points to the South Carolina Topper Site being 16,000 years old, at a time when the glacial maximum would have theoretically allowed for lower coastlines.

===The Mound Builder Myth===

The Book of Mormon is considered by many historians and archeologists to fall into the Mound Builder genre. The genre began when American colonists reached the former lands of the Hopewell tradition in the early 19th century. As with European colonialism, American manifest destiny relied on the moral and legal premise that colonization was permissible so long as the displaced natives were uncivilized. However, the existence of the Hopewell ruins definitively proved that there were civilizations in ancient North America. Manifest destiny could not allow the obvious conclusion that the builders of the Hopewell ruins were native American ancestors, leading to the invention of the myth of the Mound Builders.

Publications that speculated or repeated the Mound Builder myth are collectively known as the &quot;Mound Builder&quot; genre, which was ubiquitous during the nineteenth century. These origin myths often attributed the ruins to Vikings, the Welsh prince Madoc, Atlantis, giants, or ancient Israelites. The interest in ancient Israelites is notable because it revived the much older Jewish Indian theory, a theory also reflected in the Book of Mormon. Note that similar speculation occurred earlier in Spanish-speaking regions of the Western Hemisphere, but these had little influence on the Mound Builder myth due to a lack of available translations.

The earliest investigations of Hopewell ruins were demolitions by farmers and treasure hunters funded by speculators.
Notably, Joseph Smith, was employed as a treasure-hunter in the 1820&#x27;s, digging in the Hopewell ruins located in upstate New York. Some nineteenth-century archaeological finds (e.g., earth and timber fortifications and towns, the use of a plaster-like cement, ancient roads, metal points and implements, copper breastplates, head-plates, textiles, pearls, native North American inscriptions, North American elephant remains etc.) were well-publicized at the time of the publication of the Book of Mormon and there is incorporation of some of these ideas into the narrative.

The Mound Builder myth was also important because it contributed to the development of modern professional archeology. Some early attempts to systematically survey the formations were made as early as 1820, with a much more sophiticated survey produced in 1848 by Davis and Squier. The 1848 book was a milestone in the technical development of the modern field of archeology. By 1890, scientific consensus had overwhelmingly identified the extant native Americans as the true descendants of the Hopewell tradition.

===Proposed geographical settings===
Smith and many of his followers thought that the Jaredites, Nephites, and Lamanites were inhabitants of the ancient Americas in what is today called the hemispheric geography model by Mormon apologists. Since the publication of the Book of Mormon, archeology has documented hundreds of ancient American cultures that bear no similarity with those described in the book.

As archeology has developed, so too have beliefs within the Latter Day Saint movement. The LDS Church, the largest of dozens of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement, has shifted its stance over time. Early Mormon leaders endorsed the view that the Jaredites, Nephites, and Lamanites were the first and only inhabitants of the western hemisphere. Between 1920 and 2008, the orthodoxy shifted, culminating in an official statement that the Lamanites are the &quot;principal ancestors of the American Indians.&quot; Since 2008, the LDS Church has stated that &quot;at least a part&quot; of Native American ancestry includes a Hebrew origin.

In parallel, apologists have attempted to locate progressively smaller regions where the events of the Book of Mormon could have taken place. most notably North America, South America, and further subdivided into numerous smaller regions such as Mesoamerica or the Finger Lakes in upstate New York.
These apologists attempt to map the geographic, demographic, and economic details of the Book of Mormon to real geographic and archeological features. For example, the Book of Mormon describes a &quot;narrow neck of land&quot; or isthmus that connects a &quot;land northward&quot; and a &quot;land southward&quot;, surrounded by eastern and western seas. All models attempt to identify that isthmus and the north and south regions. All models also gravitate toward cultures known for building monumental structures. However, due to scant geographical details in the Book of Mormon, none of these models can be proven to be an exact match for the text, a fact which apologists use to discredit geographic models that they do not favor.

====Hemispheric Geography Model====
The Hemispheric Geography Model posits that the events of the Book of Mormon took place over the entirety of the North and South American continents and that Native Americans were all of Middle Eastern descent. Smith himself endorsed the hemispheric model throughout his life. For example, during a trek through Illinois, Joseph Smith stated he and his travelling group were &quot;wandering over the plains of the Nephites, recounting occasionally the history of the Book of Mormon, roving over the mounds of that once beloved people of the Lord, picking up their skulls &amp; their bones, as proof of its divine authenticity&quot;. While the hemispheric model was by far the dominant view in the early Latter Day Saint movement, it has generally lost favor as archeology has developed.

The claim that the principle ancestors of the American Indians are from the Middle East is unfounded in current archaeological and genetic research.

====Limited geography models====
=====Mesoamerican Limited Geography Model=====
The Mesoamerican Limited Geography Model posits that the events of the Book of Mormon occurred in a geographically &quot;limited&quot; region in Mesoamerica only hundreds of miles in dimension and that other people were present in the New World at the time of Lehi&#x27;s arrival. This model has been proposed and advocated by various Mormon apologists in the 20th century (both RLDS and LDS). Geographically limited settings for the Book of Mormon have been suggested by LDS church leaders as well, and this view has been published in the official church magazine, &quot;Ensign&quot;.

The Limited Mesoamerican Geography Model has been critiqued by a number of scholars, who suggest that it is not an adequate explanation for Book of Mormon geography and that the locations, events, flora and fauna described in it do not precisely match.

Among apologists, there have been critiques of this model—particularly around the location of the Hill Cumorah, which many Mormons consider to be located in New York. In a Mesoamerican Limited Geography model, this would require there to be two Cumorahs (which some consider preposterous). Other critiques include the fact that kmown Mesoamerican cities lack earthwork fortifications as described in the Book of Mormon as well as direct statements by Smith that locate Nephite lands in the Midwest.

=====Finger Lakes and Heartland Limited Geography Models=====
Some Mormon apologists hold that the events of the Book of Mormon occurred in a small region in and around the Finger Lakes region of New York or in the &quot;Heartland&quot;, which is essentially the former ranges of the Hopewell tradition and Mississippian culture. Part of the basis of this theory lies on statements made by Joseph Smith and other church leaders.

Criticism of this model comes on demographic grounds: Mormon scholars have estimated that at various periods in Book of Mormon history, the populations of civilizations discussed in the book would have ranged between 300,000 and 1.5 million people. The size of the late Jaredite civilization was even larger. According to the Book of Mormon, the final war that destroyed the Jaredites resulted in the deaths of at least two million people. From Book of Mormon population estimates, it is evident that the civilizations described are comparable in size to the civilizations of ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, ancient Rome, and the Maya. Such civilizations left numerous artifacts in the form of hewn stone ruins, tombs, temples, pyramids, roads, arches, walls, frescos, statues, vases, and coins. However, the only civilizations in the western hemisphere that ever approached that size were in the Andes and Mesoamerica. Other critiques include the lack of any form of writing among ancient North American cultures, the lack of any evidence of battle around the Hill Cumorah, and the lack of monumental stone structures.

==Anachronisms and archaeological findings==

Critics of the Book of Mormon hold that certain words and phrases in the book are anachronistic with archaeological findings. These relate to artifacts, animal, plant, or technology that critics believe did not exist in the Americas during the Book of Mormon time period (before 2500 BC to about 400 AD). The list below summarizes a few of the anachronistic criticisms in the Book of Mormon, as well as some of the most notable perspectives by Mormon apologists.

=== Horses ===
The Book of Mormon mentions horses in five incidences, and are portrayed as being in the forest upon first arrival of the Nephites, &quot;raise(d)&quot;, &quot;fed&quot;, &quot;prepared&quot; (in conjunction with chariots), used for food, and being &quot;useful unto man&quot;. Horses in the Americas are considered to have become extinct between 10,000 and 7,600 years ago, and did not reappear there until the Spaniards brought them from Europe. Horses were re-introduced to the Americas (Caribbean) by Christopher Columbus in 1493 and to the American continent by Cortés in 1519. Mormon archaeologist John L. Sorenson claims that there is fossil evidence that some New World horses may have survived the Pleistocene–Holocene transition, though these findings are disputed by other Book of Mormon scholars. Alternately, Mormon apologist Robert R. Bennett suggests that the word &quot;horse&quot; in the Book of Mormon may have referred to a different animal, such as a tapir. Recent scholarship, however, has indicated that it is possible that horses were present before the arrival of European settlers, with evidence of horses in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains decades before European-American records indicate.

=== Elephants ===
Elephants are mentioned once in the earliest Book of Mormon record in the Book of Ether. Critics argue that the archaeological record suggests that all elephant-like creatures became extinct in the New World around 10,000 BC. The source of this extinction is speculated to be the result of human predation, a significant climate change, or a combination of both factors. Recent eDNA research of sediments indicates mammoths survived until at least 6600 BC in North America. A small population of mammoths survived on St. Paul Island, Alaska, up until 3700 BC. A study of Alaskan permafrost suggests Woolly mammoths survived on mainland North America until around 5000 years ago. 

Some amateur archaeologists and Mormon authors have cited controversial evidence that North American mound builder cultures were familiar with the elephant. This evidence has long been a topic of debate with modern archaeologists concluding that the elephantine remains were improperly dated, misidentified, or openly fraudulent.

===Cattle and cows===
There are five separate incidences of &quot;cows&quot; or &quot;cattle&quot; in the New World in the Book of Mormon, including verbiage that they were &quot;raise(d)&quot; and were &quot;for the use of man&quot; or &quot;useful for the food of man&quot;, and indicates that &quot;cattle&quot; and &quot;cows&quot; were not considered the same animal. While the Book of Mormon may follow the common biblical precedent of referring to all domesticated animals as &quot;cattle&quot;, there is no evidence that Old World cattle (members of the genus &quot;Bos&quot;) inhabited the New World prior to European contact in the 16th century AD. Further, there is currently no archaeological evidence of American bison having been domesticated. It is widely accepted that the only large mammals to be domesticated in the Americas were the llama and the alpaca and that no species of goats, deer, or sheep were fully domesticated before the arrival of the Europeans to the continent.

Some Mormon apologists believe that the term &quot;cattle&quot;, as used in the Book of Mormon is more general and does not exclusively mean members of the genus &quot;Bos&quot;. Thus, they claim the term &quot;cattle&quot; may refer to mountain goats; llamas; or the ancestor of the American bison, &quot;Bison antiquus&quot; (of the subfamily Bovinae).

===Sheep===
&quot;Sheep&quot; are mentioned in the Book of Mormon metaphorically at various places in the Nephite record but are conspicuously absent in the list of animals observed in the New World upon the arrival of the Nephites. In one instance sheep are described as being possessed by the Jaredites in the Americas at . Another verse mentions &quot;lamb-skin&quot; worn by enemy armies of robbers about their loins (c. 21 AD). However, domesticated sheep are known to have been first introduced to the Americas during the second voyage of Columbus in 1493.

Mormon apologists argue the sheep referred to by the Jaredites, as the reference is not long after their arrival c. 2500 BC, is referring to Old World sheep as it is mentioned in the Book of Mormon that the Jaredites brought animals and birds with them, and the reference to lamb-skins may refer to wild sheep that were hunted. No evidence of domesticated sheep has been found in the Americas prior to Columbus.

===Goats===

&quot;Goats&quot; are mentioned three times in the Book of Mormon placing them among the Nephites and the Jaredites (i.e., between 2500 BC and 400 AD). In two of the verses, &quot;goats&quot; are distinguished from &quot;wild goats&quot;, indicating that there were at least two varieties, one of them possibly domesticated.

Domesticated goats are known to have been introduced on the American continent by Europeans in the 15th century, 1000 years after the conclusion of the Book of Mormon, and nearly 2000 years after goats are last mentioned in the Book of Mormon. The aggressive mountain goat is indigenous to North America. There is no evidence that it was ever domesticated. Mormon Apologist Matthew Roper has countered these claims, pointing out that 16th-century Spanish friars used the word &quot;goat&quot; to refer to native Mesoamerican brocket deer. There is no evidence that brocket deer were ever domesticated.

===Swine===
&quot;Swine&quot; are referred to twice in the Book of Mormon, and states that the swine were &quot;useful for the food of man&quot; among the Jaredites. There have not been any remains, references, artwork, tools, or any other evidence suggesting that swine were ever present in the pre-Columbian New World.

Apologists note that peccaries (also known as javelinas), which bear a resemblance to pigs and are in the same subfamily Suinae as swine, have been present in South America since prehistoric times. Mormon authors advocating the original mound-builder setting for the Book of Mormon have similarly suggested North American peccaries (also called &quot;wild pigs&quot;) as the &quot;swine&quot; of the Jaredites. The earliest scientific description of peccaries in the New World in Brazil in 1547 referred to them as &quot;wild pigs&quot;.

Though it has not been documented that peccaries were bred in captivity, it has been documented that peccaries were tamed, penned, and raised for food and ritual purposes in the Yucatán, Panama, the southern Caribbean, and Columbia at the time of the Conquest. Archaeological remains of peccaries have been found in Mesoamerica from the Preclassic (or Formative) period up until immediately before Spanish contact. Specifically, peccary remains have been found at Early Formative Olmec civilization sites, which civilization Mormon apologists correlate to the Book of Mormon Jaredites.

===Barley and wheat===

&quot;Barley&quot; is mentioned three times and &quot;wheat&quot; once in the Book of Mormon narrative with the ground being &quot;tilled&quot; to plant barley and wheat at one geographical location, in the 1st and 2nd century BC according to Book of Mormon chronology. The introduction of domesticated modern barley and wheat to the New World was made by Europeans after 1492. The Book of Mormon claims that non-specific &quot;seeds&quot; were brought from the land of Jerusalem and planted on arrival in the New World and produced a successful yield. To date, the existing evidence suggests that the introduction of Old World flora and fauna to the American continent happened during the Columbian exchange.

===Silk===

The Book of Mormon mentions the use of &quot;silk&quot; in the New World four times. &quot;Silk&quot; ordinarily refers to material that is created from the cocoon of one of several Asian moths, predominantly &quot;Bombyx mori&quot;; this type of silk was unknown in pre-Columbian America.

Mormon scholar John L. Sorenson documents several materials which were used in Mesoamerica to make fine cloth equivalent to silk, some of which the Spanish actually called &quot;silk&quot; upon their arrival, including the fiber (kapok) from the seed pods of the ceiba tree, the cocoons of wild moths, the fibers of silkgrass (&quot;Achmea magdalenae&quot;), the leaves of the wild pineapple plant, and the fine hair of the underbelly of rabbits. He alleges that the inhabitants of Mexico used the fiber spun by a wild silkworm to create a fabric.

The Aztecs used a silk material taken from nests made by two indigenous insects, the moth &quot;Eucheira socialis&quot; and the butterfly &quot;Gloveria&quot; &quot;psidii&quot;. The nests were cut and pieced together to make a fabric, rather than extracting and spinning the fiber as in modern silk. Spinning of silk from what are thought to be the same insects has been reported in more recent times, though its use in pre-Columbian times has been debated.

===Old World artifacts and products===

====Chariots or wheeled vehicles====

The Book of Mormon contains two accounts of &quot;chariots&quot; being used in the New World.

There is no archaeological evidence of wheeled vehicles in any part of the pre-Columbian Americas. Clark Wissler, the Curator of Ethnography at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, noted: &quot;we see that the prevailing mode of land transport in the New World was by human carrier. The wheel was unknown in pre-Columbian times.&quot;

====Iron and steel====

&quot;Steel&quot; and &quot;iron&quot; are mentioned several times in the Book of Mormon. A bow constructed from steel is described as being used in the Old World, however the necessary spring steel was not invented until the 18th century. 

The Book of Mormon also makes numerous references to swords made in the New World, and their use in battle. When the remnants of the Jaredites&#x27; final battle were discovered, the Book of Mormon narrative states that some swords were collected and &quot;the hilts thereof have perished, and the blades thereof were cankered with rust.&quot; No evidence of Pre-Columbian iron smelting has ever been found anywhere in the Western Hemisphere and all examples of iron artifacts are fabricated from meteoric iron.

Some limited metalworking was independently discovered by ancient American cultures, however. The Old Copper cultures around the Great Lakes are among the oldest metal-workers in human history due the region containing the world&#x27;s largest native copper deposit. Starting 8000 years ago, these peoples extracted and cold-worked native copper into a vast array of tools. By 3000 years ago, most tools were no longer produced from copper due to the superior properties of stone tools, though awls continued to be produced and used for thousands more years. Due to the abundance of high quality stone and copper, the Great Lakes cultures never had a need to develop smelting or alloying. Not surprisingly due to the material properties of pure copper, bladed tools were rare, though a few examples have been recovered on Isle Royale and around Lake Superior. Copper mined around Lake Superior was traded extensively and as a result can be found in Pre-Columbian sites all across North America.

Mesoamerican cultures began extracting copper ore and smelting it 1400 years ago, including independently discovering the lost-wax casting method. Starting 800 years ago, these cultures experimented with alloying copper, gold, and silver. Nearly all examples of metalworking from this region are ornamental prestige pieces. All iron artifacts were prestige objects that were cold-worked from meteoric iron and were formed into mirrors, beads, hammers, and possibly magnetic compasses.

The Inca Empire independently discovered how to smelt and alloy copper into bronze, which it worked into a wide range of tools, including bolas, plumb bobs, chisels, gravers, pry bars, tweezers, needles, plates, fish hooks, spatulas, ladles, knives (tumi), bells, breastplates, lime spoons, mace heads, ear spools, bowls, cloak pins (tupus), axes, and foot plow adzes. Additionally, South American cultures regularly worked gold and other precious metals.

Between 2004 and 2007, a Purdue University archaeologist, Kevin J. Vaughn, discovered a 2000-year-old hematite mine near Nazca, Peru. Although hematite is today mined as an iron ore, Vaughn believes that the hematite was then being mined for use as red pigment. There are also numerous excavations that included iron minerals. He noted:

Even though ancient Andean people smelted some metals, such as copper, they never smelted iron like they did in the Old World …. Metals were used for a variety of tools in the Old World, such as weapons, while in the Americas, metals were used as prestige goods for the wealthy elite.

Due to lack of evidence for Pre-Columbian iron or bronze swords, some apologists in the 1990s began to argue that the references to swords may instead refer to a number of weapons such as the macuahuitl, a war club lined with obsidian blades that was used by the Aztecs.

====Cimeters====
&quot;Cimeters&quot; are mentioned in eight instances in the Book of Mormon stretching from approximately 500 BC to 51 BC. Critics argue this existed hundreds of years before the term &quot;scimitar&quot; was coined. The word &quot;cimiter&quot; is considered an anachronism since the word was never used by the Hebrews (from which the Book of Mormon peoples came) or any other civilization prior to 450 AD. The word &#x27;cimeterre&#x27; is found in the 1661 English dictionary Glossographia and is defined as &quot;a crooked sword&quot; and was part of the English language at the time that the Book of Mormon was translated. In the 7th century, scimitars generally first appeared among the Turko- Mongol nomads of Central Asia however a notable exception was the sickle sword of ancient Egypt known as the khopesh which was used from 3000 BC and is found on the Rosetta Stone dated to 196 BC. Eannatum, the king of Lagash, is shown on a Sumerian stele from 2500 BC equipped with a sickle sword.

Apologists Michael R. Ash and William Hamblin postulate that the word was chosen by Joseph Smith as the closest workable English word for a short curved weapon used by the Nephites.
Mormon scholar Matthew Roper has noted there are a variety of weapons with curved blades found in Mesoamerica.

====System of exchange based on measures of grain using precious metals as a standard====

The Book of Mormon details a system of measures used by the societies described therein. No form of fiat currency, such as measures of gold for grain as described in the Book of Mormon, is known to have existed in any pre-Columbian culture. The vast majority of ancient Native American economies were gift economies, which do not use any form of currency and instead rely on reciprocal exchanges governed by social goodwill. Limited use of commodity currencies existed in large empires, such as in Mesoamerica where cacao beans were sometimes used.

===Knowledge of Hebrew and Egyptian languages===

 The Book of Mormon describes more than one literate people inhabiting ancient America. The Nephite people are described as possessing a language and writing with roots in Hebrew and Egyptian, and writing part of the original text of the Book of Mormon in this unknown language, called reformed Egyptian. A transcript of some of the characters of this language has been preserved in what had previously been erroneously identified as the &quot;Anthon Transcript&quot; but is now known as the &quot;Caractors document&quot;.

Fifteen examples of distinct scripts have been identified in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, many from a single inscription. While Maya contains cartouches and is a form of hieroglyphic script like Egyptian, no further resemblance to Hebrew or Egyptian hieroglyphs has been identified. Additionally, many professional linguists and Egyptologists do not consider the Caractors document to contain legitimate ancient writing. Edward H. Ashment called the characters of the transcript &quot;hieroglyphics of the Micmac Indians of northeastern North America&quot;.

The Smithsonian Institution has noted, &quot;Reports of findings of ancient Egyptian Hebrew, and other Old World writings in the New World in pre-Columbian contexts have frequently appeared in newspapers, magazines, and sensational books. None of these claims has stood up to examination by reputable scholars. No inscriptions using Old World forms of writing have been shown to have occurred in any part of the Americas before 1492 except for a few Norse rune stones which have been found in Greenland.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;irr.org/smith&quot;&gt; (hosted on the Institute for Religious Research website)&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic studies on the evolution of the spoken languages of the Americas agree with the widely held model that &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; arrived in America between 14,000 and 12,000 years ago.

===Systems of measuring time (calendars)===

Most North American tribes relied upon a calendar of 13 months, relating to the annual number of lunar cycles. Seasonal rounds and ceremonies were performed each moon. Months were counted in the days between phase cycles of the moon. Calendar systems in use in North America during this historical period relied on this simple system.

One of the more distinctive features shared among pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations is the use of an extensive system of inter-related calendars. The epigraphic and archaeological record for this practice dates back at least 2,500 years, by which time it appears to have been well-established. The most widespread and significant of these calendars was the 260-day calendar, formed by combining 20 named days with 13 numerals in successive sequence (13 × 20 = 260). Another system of perhaps equal antiquity is the 365-day calendar, approximating the solar year, formed from 18 &quot;months&quot; × 20 named days + 5 additional days. These systems and others are found in societies of that era such as the Olmec, Zapotec, Mixe-Zoque, Mixtec, and Maya (whose system of Maya calendars are widely regarded as the most intricate and complex among them) reflected the vigesimal (base 20) numeral system and other numbers, such as 7, 9, 13, and 19.

==Latter-day Saints and Book of Mormon archaeology==

===Early activities===
In the early 1840s, John Lloyd Stephens&#x27; two-volume work &quot;Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan&quot; was seen by some church members as an essential guide to the ruins of Book of Mormon cities. In the fall of 1842, an article appearing in the church&#x27;s &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; alleged that the ruins of Quiriguá, discovered by Stephens, may be the very ruins of Zarahemla or some other Book of Mormon city. Other articles followed, including one published shortly after the death of Joseph Smith. Every Latter Day Saint was encouraged to read Stephens&#x27; book and to regard the stone ruins described in it as relating to the Book of Mormon. It is now believed that these Central American ruins date more recent than Book of Mormon times.

In recent years, there have been differing views among Book of Mormon scholars, particularly between the scholars and the &quot;hobbyists&quot;.

===New World Archaeological Foundation===
From the mid-1950s onwards, New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), based out of Brigham Young University, has sponsored archaeological excavations in Mesoamerica, with a focus on the Mesoamerican time period known as the Preclassic (earlier than c. AD 200). The results of these and other investigations, while producing valuable archaeological data, have not led to any widespread acceptance by non-Mormon archaeologists of the Book of Mormon account. In 1973, citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, wrote,

As far as I know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing the historicity of the Book of Mormon, and I would like to state that there are quite a few Mormon archaeologists who join this group.

In 1955, Thomas Stuart Ferguson, an attorney and the founder of the NWAF, received five years of funding from the LDS Church and the NWAF then began to dig throughout Mesoamerica for evidence of the veracity of the Book of Mormon claims. In a 1961 newsletter, Ferguson predicted that although nothing had been found, the Book of Mormon cities would be found within 10 years. The NWAF became part of BYU in 1961 and Ferguson was removed from the director position.

Eleven years after Ferguson was no longer affiliated with the NWAF, in 1972 Christian scholar Hal Hougey wrote Ferguson questioning the progress given the stated timetable in which the cities would be found. Replying to Hougey, as well as other secular and non-secular requests, Ferguson wrote in a letter dated 5 June 1972: &quot;Ten years have passed …. I had sincerely hoped that Book-of-Mormon cities would be positively identified within 10 years—and time has proved me wrong in my anticipation.&quot;

In 1976, fifteen years removed from any archaeological involvement with the NWAF, referring to his own paper, Ferguson wrote a letter in which he stated:

The real implication of the paper is that you can&#x27;t set the Book-of-Mormon geography down anywhere—because it is fictional and will never meet the requirements of the dirt-archaeology. I should say—what is in the ground will never conform to what is in the book.

Though the NWAF failed to establish a common belief of a specific Book of Mormon geographic location, the archaeological investigations of NWAF-sponsored projects were a success for ancient American archaeology in general which has been recognized and appreciated by non-Mormon archaeologists. Currently BYU maintains 86 documents on the work of the NWAF at the BYU NWAF website; these documents are used outside both BYU and the LDS Church by researchers.

===Modern approach and conclusions===
An example of the mainstream archaeological opinion of Mormon archaeology is summarized by historian and journalist Hampton Sides:

Yale&#x27;s Michael Coe likes to talk about what he calls &quot;the fallacy of misplaced concreteness,&quot; the tendency among Mormon theorists like Sorenson to keep the discussion trained on all sorts of extraneous subtopics … while avoiding what is most obvious: that Joseph Smith probably meant &quot;horse&quot; when he wrote down the word &quot;horse&quot;.

==Organizational statements regarding the Book of Mormon==

===National Geographic Society===
The Institute for Religious Research posted on its website a 1998 letter from National Geographic Society that stated that the Society was unaware of any archaeological evidence that would support the Book of Mormon.

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
The Gospel Topics essays section of the official website of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has two essays titled &quot;Book of Mormon and DNA Studies&quot; and &quot;Book of Mormon Translation&quot;. In them, the church affirms the literal historicity of the Book of Mormon. In the essay on DNA studies, the church argues for &quot;a more careful approach to the data,&quot; and states that &quot;much work remains to be done to fully understand the origins of the native populations of the Americas.&quot; Meanwhile, in the essay on the Book of Mormon&#x27;s translation, the church affirms that &quot;the Book of Mormon came into the world through a series of miraculous events.&quot;

==Mormon cultural belief regarding Book of Mormon archaeology==

=== Existing ancient records of the New World ===
The Smithsonian Institution has noted, &quot;Reports of findings of ancient Egyptian Hebrew, and other Old World writings in the New World in pre-Columbian contexts have frequently appeared in newspapers, magazines, and sensational books. None of these claims has stood up to examination by reputable scholars. No inscriptions using Old World forms of writing have been shown to have occurred in any part of the Americas before 1492 except for a few Norse rune stones which have been found in Greenland.&quot;

Losses of ancient writings occurred in the Old World, including as a result of deliberate or accidental fires, wars, earthquakes, and floods. Similar losses occurred in the New World. Much of the literature of the pre-Columbian Maya was destroyed during the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. Mormon apologist Michael Coe therefore argues that our knowledge and understanding of the Maya is too fragmentary and incomplete to rule out the Book of Mormon narrative conclusively.

The Maya civilization also left behind a vast corpus of inscriptions (upwards of ten thousand are known) written in the Maya script, the earliest of which date from around the 3rd century BC with the majority written in the Classic Period (c. 250–900 AD). Mayanist scholarship is now able to decipher a large number of these inscriptions. These inscriptions are mainly concerned with the activities of Mayan rulers and the commemoration of significant events, with the oldest known Long Count date corresponding to December 7, 36 BC, being recorded on Chiapa de Corzo &quot;Stela 2&quot; in central Chiapas. None of these inscriptions have been correlated with events, places, or rulers of Book of Mormon.

===Efforts to correlate artifacts===

====Izapa Stela 5====

In the early 1950s, M. Wells Jakeman of the BYU Department of Archaeology suggested that a complicated scene carved on Stela 5 in Izapa was a depiction of a Book of Mormon event called &quot;Lehi&#x27;s dream&quot;, which features a vision of the tree of life. This interpretation is disputed by other Mormon and non-Mormon scholars. Julia Guernsey Kappelman, author of a definitive work on Izapan culture, finds that Jakeman&#x27;s research &quot;belies an obvious religious agenda that ignored Izapa Stela 5&#x27;s heritage&quot;.

====Other artifacts====
Sorenson claims that one artifact, La Venta Stela 3, depicts a person with Semitic features (&quot;striking beard and beaked nose&quot;). Mormon researchers such as Robin Heyworth have claimed that Copan Stela B depicts elephants; others such as Alfred M Tozzer and Glover M Allen claim it depicts macaws.

<text>Sir Ross Frederick Cranston (born 23 July 1948) is a professor of Law at London School of Economics and a retired High Court judge. He is also a former British Labour Party politician, and served as the Member of Parliament for Dudley North between 1997 and 2005.

==Early life==
Cranston was born in Australia, and attended Wavell State High School in Brisbane, Queensland. He was later a student at the University of Queensland where he was awarded a BA in 1969 and LLB in 1970. From Harvard Law School, he gained LLM in 1973. From Oxford University, he was awarded DPhil in 1976 and DCL in 1998. He became a barrister of Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1976.

Cranston was a professor at London School of Economics from 1992 to 1997 and the holder of the Cassell chair in commercial law from 1993 to 1997. Before that he held academic posts in the UK and Australia, including being a lecturer in the mid-1970s at the University of Warwick and as a professor of Law at Queen Mary and Westfield College from 1986 to 1991, where he held the Sir John Lubbock chair in banking law. He was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1998.

==Parliamentary career==
After contesting Richmond in North Yorkshire in 1992, William Hague&#x27;s seat, coming third, Cranston was elected as the Member of Parliament for Dudley North at the next general election in 1997 with more than half of the votes cast. He served as Solicitor General from 1998 to 2001, when he returned to the back benches. After speculation amongst colleagues, he announced in 2005 that he would not stand for Parliament again in the 2005 general election. He was succeeded by Ian Austin.

==Legal career==
Cranston was the Centennial Professor of Law at the LSE from 2005 to 2007, and returned as a professor of law from 2017.

Appointed as a High Court judge in October 2007, he was assigned to the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division. Marcel Berlins wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; at the time that Cranston&#x27;s appointment was unusual among judicial appointments in recent years, given that it occurred so soon after the end of his political career. Cranston retired with effect from 16 March 2017.

<text>An input method (or input method editor, commonly abbreviated IME) is an operating system component or program that enables users to generate characters not natively available on their input devices by using sequences of characters (or mouse operations) that are available to them. Using an input method is usually necessary for languages that have more graphemes than there are keys on the keyboard.

For instance, on the computer, this allows the user of Latin keyboards to input Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Indic characters. On hand-held devices, it enables the user to type on the numeric keypad to enter Latin alphabet characters (or any other alphabet characters) or touch a screen display to input text. On some operating systems, an input method is also used to define the behavior of the dead keys.

==Implementations==
Although originally coined for CJK (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) computing, the term is now sometimes used generically to refer to a program to support the input of any language. To illustrate, in the X Window System, the facility to allow the input of Latin characters with diacritics is also called an input method.

On Windows XP or later Windows, Input method, or IME, are also called &quot;Text Input Processor&quot;, which are implemented by the Text Services Framework API.

==Relationship between the methodology and implementation==
While the term &quot;input method editor&quot; was originally used for Microsoft Windows, its use has now gained acceptance in other operating systems, especially when it is important to distinguish between the computer interface and implementation of input methods, or among the input methods themselves, the editing functionality of the program or operating system component providing the input method, and the general support of input methods in an operating system. This term has, for example, gained general acceptance on the Linux operating system; it is also used on the Mac OS.
*The term &quot;input method&quot; generally refers to a particular way to use the keyboard to input a particular language, for example the Cangjie method, the pinyin method, or the use of dead keys.
*On the other hand, the term &quot;input method editor&quot; on Microsoft products refers to the program that allows an input method to be used (for example MS New Pinyin), or the &quot;editing area&quot; that allows the user to do the input. It can also refer to a character palette, which allows any Unicode character to be input individually. One might also interpret IME to refer to the editor used for creating or modifying the data files upon which an input method relies.

*/XT9—Type the key for every letter once, then, if needed, type Next until the right word comes up. May also correct misspellings and regional typos (if an adjacent key is pressed incorrectly).
* —Similar to first-generation T9, with word autocomplete.
*—Hit the key with the letter you want, if it doesn&#x27;t come up, hit Next until it does.
* (An array, almost square, which minimizes distance travelled from one letter to another.)

<text>Sir David Anthony Crausby (born 17 June 1946) is a British Labour politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bolton North East from 1997 to 2019.

Born in Bury, Lancashire, Crausby worked as a turner and later became a workplace representative for the Amalgamated Engineering Union. He was a Member of Bury Metropolitan Borough Council from 1979 to 1992, and elected as an MP at the 1997 general election.

A backbencher throughout his tenure in Parliament, Crausby was a long-serving member of the Defence Select Committee and Panel of Chairs. He represented the UK internationally as a delegate to the Nato and Council of Europe Parliamentary Assemblies, and was knighted in the 2017 New Year Honours. Crausby lost his seat to the Conservatives at the 2019 general election.

==Early life and career==

Crausby was born in Bury, Lancashire and educated locally at Derby Grammar School, now Derby High School, and Bury Technical College. He began a career as a turner, becoming an apprentice centre lathe turner in 1962, and later became works convenor for the Amalgamated Engineering Union at Beloit Walmsleys Ltd in Bolton. He remained in this position until his election to the House of Commons in 1997. He was elected a councillor in 1979 to the then Bury District Council, and served until 1992.

==Parliamentary career==
He contested the marginal Bury North seat, having been just elected as chairman of the local constituency Labour Party, at the 1987 general election but was defeated by the sitting Conservative MP Alistair Burt by 6,911 votes. He contested the Conservative-held marginal seat of Bolton North East at the 1992 general election where the sitting MP Peter Thurnham was defending an 813 majority. Bolton North East became more marginal with Thurnham retaining the seat by just 185 votes.

Thurnham retired at the 1997 general election, having crossed the floor to join the Liberal Democrats on 12 October 1996. Crausby defeated the new Conservative candidate, Rob Wilson, by 12,669 votes. He made his maiden speech on 17 July 1997, in which he remembered the inventor of the spinning mule Samuel Crompton who was born in Bolton.

Crausby remained the MP there from 1997 until 2019. His majority fell to 8,422 in 2001 and 4,103 in 2005. In the 2010 and 2015 general elections his majorities were 4,084 and 4,377. In the 2017 general election he was again returned, with a majority of 3,797. He lost his seat to the Conservative Mark Logan by 378 votes in the 2019 general election.

In parliament, Crausby joined the Social Security Select committee in 1999, and was a member of the Defence Select Committee from the 2001 general election to 2010. He voted against the Iraq War in 2003.

In 2010 he became a member of the Speaker&#x27;s Panel of Chairs and has overseen many debates in the Commons on behalf of the speaker, including the historic European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

Crausby has a long-standing interest in improving railways in his constituency. He lobbied the last Labour government to address overcrowding and opposed the idea of a Greater Manchester congestion charge because of the lack of viable alternatives. He campaigned to retain the Preston-Bolton-Manchester electrification project which was at risk of cancellation after Labour lost the 2010 election. He has continued to lobby the Government through letters, petitions, and Parliamentary debates. In 2018 Crausby led a debate on Northern trains and called for the resignation of Transport Secretary Chris Grayling after the disastrous May timetable caused mass disruption across the North of England.

Crausby has also been involved in international politics. He represented the UK as a member of the delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly from 2005 to 2015 and the UK delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe from 2013 to 2017.

In 2011, Crausby won &quot;The House&quot; magazine&#x27;s Commons Speech of the Year, for his speech on bringing the military covenant into law, beating the then prime minister, David Cameron.

In February 2013, Crausby voted against the second reading of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. Subsequently, in May 2013 the MP voted against the bill’s third and final reading, opposing the legalisation of same-sex marriage within England and Wales.

Crausby was knighted in the 2017 New Year Honours. Crausby lost his seat at the 2019 General Election.

==Personal life==
He married Enid Anne Noon in 1965 in Bury and they have two sons. His eldest son, also named David, is a commercial and editorial photographer; his work is represented by several agencies including Getty Images and Alamy. His son is currently based in Germany.

<doc id="419517" wikidata="Q5614148" url="?curid=419517" title="John Cummings (politician)">
<text>John Scott Cummings (6 July 1943 – 4 January 2017) was a British Labour politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Easington from 1987 until 2010.

==Early life==
Cummings was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, a fifth-generation coal miner. He was educated at the Murton Council Infant and Junior schools on Watt Street and Secondary school. He attended both the Easington Technical College and the Durham Technical College until 1962. He began his career with the National Coal Board as a miner in 1958, working as a pit electrician from 1967 until his election to the House of Commons twenty years later. He was elected as a councillor to the Easington District Council in 1970, was its chairman from 1975 to 1976, and was its leader from 1979 until he stepped down in 1987. Active on picket lines during the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike, in which Easington was the location of several clashes with the police, Cummings later claimed his Jack Russell Terrier Grit had been trained to &quot;nip at policemen&#x27;s ankles&quot;.

He was a member of the Northumbrian Water Authority and the Peterlee and Newton Aycliffe Development Corporation. A trade unionist with the National Union of Mineworkers, he was a trustee for the union from 1986 to 2000.

==Parliamentary career==
Cummings was first elected to the House of Commons at the 1987 General Election as the Labour MP for Easington following the retirement of Jack Dormand. His majority was 24,639. Entering the Commons at the same time as another former miner from the North-East, Ronnie Campbell, the two men were described by journalist Andrew Roth as &quot;rough diamonds, set to shine&quot;.

In parliament, he became a member of the Environment Select committee from 1990 until he was promoted to become an Opposition Whip by Tony Blair in 1995. However, he was sacked after the 1997 General Election and did not serve in government. He again joined the environment select committee (in its various guises of Environment, Transport and the Regions and Transport, Local Government and the Regions). He was a member of the Speaker&#x27;s Panel of Chairmen from 2000 and served on the select committee of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister from 2002.

On 9 October 2006, Cummings announced his intention to stand down at the next general election. In September 2007, the Easington Constituency Labour Party (CLP) selected local councillor and CLP secretary Grahame Morris as their candidate for the 2010 election.

==Personal life==
Unmarried and Roman Catholic, he died from lung cancer in January 2017 in Durham at the age of 73.

He also served as the Vice-Chair of the Leisure Committee from 1975 until 1977, serving as the Chair from 1979 until 1982. He next served as the Vice-Chair of the Transport and Highways Committee from 1983 until 1985 when he became the Chief Whip of the Labour Group on the Council from 1985 until 1987 when he became the Deputy Leader of Coventry City Council. The following year, Cunningham was elected leader of the Labour group and therefore the council. Following becoming leader of the council, Cunningham left his job at Rolls-Royce as an engineer and shop steward. Cunningham did not take company shares when Rolls Royce was privatised.

Cunningham was leader of Coventry City Council until his election to Parliament in 1992.

As leader of Coventry City Council, Cunningham travelled extensively to cities in western and eastern Europe, many of which were twinned with Coventry. These visits included trips to Volgograd, Moscow, Caen, Frankfurt, Dresden, Prague and Warsaw. On one visit to Poland in 1990 Cunningham was part of a delegation to Auschwitz.

==Parliament==
Cunningham was selected to contest the Coventry South East constituency at the 1992 general election following the expulsion of the sitting Labour MP Dave Nellist, a member of the Trotskyist Militant group, who had thus become ineligible to be selected as the Labour candidate. Cunningham emerged as the victor with a majority of 1,311 votes over the Conservative candidate Martine Hyams; Nellist finished third but only by a further 40 votes.

Cunningham made his maiden speech on 12 May 1992 in which he spoke of the social and economic problems of Coventry and criticised the then level of central government resources allocated to the city.

Following reports from the previous year that the Queen was to agree to pay income tax, which Buckingham Palace and the Prime Minister denied, he called for the Queen and other members of the Royal Family to begin paying income tax in his letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1992.

Cunningham was heavily involved in the campaign for justice for former workers of Matrix Churchill In particular Cunningham was critical of the remit and progress of the Scott Report into the Arms-to-Iraq for not consulting the former workers.

Reflecting his previous career Cunningham set up a Parliamentary group for Rolls-Royce bringing together MPs and Trade Unions. Throughout his time in Parliament, Cunningham consistently campaigned for Rolls-Royce workers.

In 1994 Cunningham chaired the Committee on the hybrid Croydon Tramlink Bill, which recommended the project go ahead. Cunningham was a founder member andserved as chair of the APPG on Strokes. In 2002 CUnningham secured an adjournment debate on the subject.

He became a member of the Home Affairs Select committee from 1993 until 1997. He then served on the Trade and Industry Select Committee from 1997 as well as serving upon the House of Commons Panel of Chairs from 1998 leaving both upon the 2001 general election. Cunningham then served on the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee from 2003 until 2005.

In 2004, he led a parliamentary campaign to prevent Jaguar Cars closing its Browns Lane assembly plant. This campaign included organising a meeting between several workers of the plant and the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer as well as Cunningham joining factory workers when they lobbied the Ford managers at the Paris Motor Show.

Cunningham briefly served on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Select Committee in 2005 until the general election.

Following the 2005 election, he served on the House of Commons Procedures Select Committee until 2006 and served as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Solicitor General Mike O&#x27;Brien until 2007. Cunningham remained O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s PPS as O&#x27;Brien became a Minister of State at the Department for Work and Pensions from 2007 until 2008, then a Minister of State at the Department of Energy and Climate Change from 2008 until 2009 and as a Minister of State at the Department of Health from 2009 until 2010. Cunningham served on the Standards and Privileges Select Committee in 2010.

He served as the Treasurer of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Funerals and Bereavement from 2005 until 2010 and is the Vice-Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Chinese Development.

From 2005 to 2019 Cunningham was the Chair of the West Midlands Group of Labour MPs.

In 2006 Cunningham arranged a meeting between Trade Unions representing workers at Peugeot Ryton and the Chancellor Gordon Brown over threats to the future of the plant.

During the 2009 parliamentary expenses scandal, Cunningham was praised by &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, which cited his consistently low expenses that made him the 27th lowest claiming MP out of 645 MPs.

In 2009 Cunningham helped secure extra funding from the government for the Coventry Rape and Sexual Assault Centre (CRASAC).

In 2011, Cunningham arranged a meeting with the Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology Peter Luff, as a response to the Rolls-Royce announcement that it would lay off one quarter of its staff at its Ansty plant by 2012 due to the UK defence cuts and the plant&#x27;s reliance upon repairing and servicing RAF jet engines. As well as these planned redundancies, Rolls-Royce also plans temporary redundancies during periods of low activity and having staff work longer without being paid extra. Cunningham questioned what the government&#x27;s plans were to secure more work for the plant and met with union officials and management in order to find a solution to safeguard the plant and its work force.

Alongside the then Coventry North West MP Geoffrey Robinson Cunningham lobbied successive governments for the development and exapansion of Ansty Park as a centre for high tech manufacturing. This included a visit by the then Minister Margaret Hodge to make sure the project did not stall.

Cunningham supported the campaign to renovate Coventry&#x27;s medieval Charterhouse Priory, one of only nine Carthusian monasteries left in the UK. In 2012 he facilitated a visit by the then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries Ed Vaizey to the site to draw attention to the campaign.

In 2013, Cunningham campaigned with Unite the Union to keep London Taxis International producing the iconic Black Hackney Cab in Coventry. Cunningham also actively campaigned to keep Jaguar Land Rover in the West Midlands following the purchase of the company by Tata. This included meeting with Tata to gain assurances that work would stay in the region. In the same year Cunningham also campaigned to save the Remploy factory in his constituency.

Cunningham was also a longterm campaigner against the use and abuse of zero hours contracts. In a 2013 debate in Parliament he stated &#x27;that zero-hours contracts are a throwback to the 1930s when miners and dockers had to turn up to work not knowing whether they would get a job. This is a modern veneer on an old, tried and tired system that was chucked out many years ago&#x27;.

He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election.

Cunningham consistently called for the Government to intervene in the issues surrounding Coventry City Football Club. In 2016 he lobbied the then Sports Minister Tracey Crouch to appoint a conciliator to break the deadlock in negotiations. In 2019 Cunningham helped to organise a meeting between the interested parties, local MPs and the then Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Jeremy Wright.

Cunningham actively supported Coventry&#x27;s bid to be UK City of Culture 2021. As part of the campaign, Cunningham hosted a reception for the bid in Parliament and secured an adjournment debate.

Cunningham actively supported the WASPI campaign to compensate Women born in the 1950s who were effected by changes to pensions.

In 2019 Cunningham led a campaign to make sure specialist Pancreatic Cancer services remained at UHCW. In the same year Cunningham became a prominent critic of the Conservative Government&#x27;s plan to scrap free TV Licences for the over 75s.

He announced he would be standing down in the 2019 general election shortly after fellow Coventry MP Geoffrey Robinson also announced his intention to depart.

<doc id="419522" wikidata="Q193407" url="?curid=419522" title="Leaf beetle">
<text>The insects of the beetle family Chrysomelidae are commonly known as leaf beetles, and include over 37,000 (and probably at least 50,000) species in more than 2,500 genera, making up one of the largest and most commonly encountered of all beetle families. Numerous subfamilies are recognized, but the precise taxonomy and systematics are likely to change with ongoing research.

Leaf beetles are partially recognizable by their tarsal formula, which appears to be 4-4-4, but is actually 5-5-5 as the fourth tarsal segment is very small and hidden by the third. As with many taxa, no single character defines the Chrysomelidae; instead, the family is delineated by a set of characters. Some lineages are only distinguished with difficulty from longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae), namely by the antennae not arising from frontal tubercles.

Adult and larval leaf beetles feed on all sorts of plant tissue. Many are serious pests of cultivated plants, for example the Colorado potato beetle (&quot;Leptinotarsa decemlineata&quot;), the asparagus beetle (&quot;Crioceris asparagi&quot;), the cereal leaf beetle (&quot;Oulema melanopus&quot;), the mustard beetle (&quot;Phaedon cochleariae&quot;) and various flea beetles, and a few act as vectors of plant diseases. Others are beneficial due to their use in biocontrol of invasive weeds. Some Chrysomelidae are conspicuously colored, typically in glossy yellow to red or metallic blue-green hues, and some (especially Cassidinae) have spectacularly bizarre shapes. Thus, they are highly popular among insect collectors.

==Description==
The imagos of leaf beetles are small to medium-sized, i.e. most species range from 1.0 to 18 mm in length, excluding appendages, with just a few larger species such as &quot;Alurnus humeralis&quot;, which reaches 35 mm. The bodies of most species are domed, and oval in dorsal view (though some are round or elongated), and they often possess a metallic luster or multiple colors. In most specimens, the antennae are notably shorter than head, thorax, and abdomen, i.e. not more than half their combined length. The second antennal segment is of normal size (which differentiates leaf beetles from the closely related longhorn beetles). In most species, the antennal segments are of a more or less equal shape, at most they gradually widen towards the tip, although some Galerucinae in particular have modified segments, mainly in males. The first segment of the antenna in most cases is larger than the following ones. The pronotum of leaf beetles varies between species. In most, it is slightly to highly domed and trapezoidal to rounded-squarish in dorsal view. In some subfamilies such as the Cassidinae and to a lesser extent the Cryptocephalinae, the head is covered by the pronotum and thus not visible from above. The first three sternites are not fused, instead being linked by mobile sutures. Most species possess wings, although the level of development and thus flight ability varies widely, including within a single species, and some are flightless with fused elytra.

==Subfamilies==
The family includes these subfamilies:
* Bruchinae – bean weevils or seed beetles
* Cassidinae – tortoise beetles; includes the former &quot;Hispinae&quot;
* Chrysomelinae – broad-bodied leaf beetles
* Criocerinae – asparagus beetles, lily beetles, etc.
* Cryptocephalinae – cylindrical leaf beetles and warty leaf beetles; includes former &quot;Chlamisinae&quot; and &quot;Clytrinae&quot;
* Donaciinae – longhorned leaf beetles
* Eumolpinae – oval leaf beetles
* Galerucinae – includes the former &quot;Alticinae&quot; (flea beetles)
* Lamprosomatinae 
* Sagrinae – frog-legged beetles or kangaroo beetles
* Spilopyrinae 
* Synetinae – sometimes considered a tribe of Eumolpinae

Until recently, the subfamily Bruchinae was considered a separate family, while two former subfamilies are presently considered families (Orsodacnidae and Megalopodidae). Other commonly recognized subfamilies have recently been grouped with other subfamilies, usually reducing them to tribal rank (e.g., the former Alticinae, Chlamisinae, Clytrinae, and Hispinae). The extinct subfamily Protoscelidinae, containing fossils described from the Middle to Late Jurassic Karabastau Formation, Kazakhstan, has been transferred to the family Anthribidae.

== Diet ==
Chrysomelidae in general are herbivorous. Adults mostly feed on leaves and flowers of angiosperm plants, while larval diets are diverse.

* Bruchinae larvae are seed-borers, usually in seeds of legumes. Many adults feed on pollen, not necessarily that of the larval host. Some do not feed as adults.
* Cassidinae larvae may be leaf miners (many of the former Hispinae), stem borers (e.g. &quot;Estigmena&quot;) and external leaf feeders (e.g. &quot;Leptispa&quot;, &quot;Oediopalpa&quot;).
* Chrysomelinae generally feed on leaves as adults and larvae, though some species feed on flowers instead.
* Criocerinae larvae are usually leaf miners or feed externally on leaves. Some species are gallers instead.
* Eumolpinae larvae feed on roots.
* Most Cryptocephalinae larvae live and feed in leaf litter, making them detritivores, while a few feed on green leaves. Some Cryptocephalinae have larvae that live in ant nests (myrmecophily), where they feed on dead plant or even dead animal matter.
* The semi-aquatic Donaciinae have larvae feeding on the sap of roots of aquatic plants. In addition to food, they also obtain oxygen this way, from the plant&#x27;s intercellular spaces. Adults feed on leaves of aquatic plants.
* Galerucinae are quite varied, with larvae living in soil and feeding on rootlets (e.g. &quot;Aulacophora&quot;, &quot;Cerotoma&quot;, &quot;Diabrotica&quot;), mining leaves (some &quot;Monoxia&quot;) or feeding externally on plants (e.g. &quot;Arima&quot;, &quot;Galeruca&quot;, &quot;Galerucella&quot;).
* Lamprosomatinae larvae feed on green plant parts or graze on bark.
* Sagrinae larvae mostly form galls in stems of shrubs, though &quot;Mecynodera balyi&quot; instead feeds inside seed pods of &quot;Pandorea&quot; vines. Adults feed on pollen.
* Spilopyrinae larvae are external leaf feeders.
* Synetinae larvae feed on roots, mainly of trees in cold northern forests.

To be able to digest the plant matter, the beetles use enzymes like pectinases. This group of enzymes are either produced by the beetles themselves, due to horizontal gene transfer, or symbiotic bacteria provides them with the enzymes. But both solutions are never used simultaneously.

==Natural enemies==
A Finnish researcher published an exhaustive paper describing the natural enemies of the alder leaf beetle &quot;Plagiosterna aenea&quot; and other species of leaf beetles observed in the field. Predators of chrysomelid eggs include true bugs such as &quot;Anthocorus nemorum&quot; and &quot;Orthotylus marginalis.&quot; Hoverflies (e.g. &quot;Parasyrphus nigritarsis&quot;) sometimes lay eggs adjacent to beetle egg clutches and when the fly larva hatches it consumes beetle eggs and young larvae. Larval predators include &quot;A. nemorum,&quot; the bug &quot;Rhacognathus punctatus&quot;, and the wasp &quot;Symmorphus bifasciatus&quot;. Some species of wasps, such as &quot;Polistes carolina&quot;, have been known to prey upon Chrysomelidae larvae after the eggs are laid in flowers. Adult beetles are consumed by &quot;R. punctatus&quot;. More information about natural enemies can be found in the articles about the chrysomelid beetles &quot;Chrysomela aeneicollis,&quot; &quot;Phratora laticollis&quot; and &quot;Phratora vitellinae.&quot;

<doc id="419525" wikidata="Q2538997" url="?curid=419525" title="Turville">
<text>Turville is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. It is in the Chiltern Hills, west of High Wycombe, east-southeast of Watlington, north of Henley-on-Thames and 2 miles (3 km) from the Oxfordshire border. The name is Anglo-Saxon in origin and means &#x27;dry field&#x27;. It was recorded in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; in 796 as &quot;Thyrefeld&quot;.

The manor of Turville once belonged to the abbey at St Albans, but was seized by the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1547. The manor house has since been rebuilt as Turville Park, and was held by the Hoare Nairne family for most of the 20th century. The present incumbent of the manor is Lord Sainsbury. Turville was home to Ellen Sadler, who fell asleep in 1871, aged eleven, and purportedly did not wake for nine years, becoming known as the &quot;Sleeping Girl of Turville&quot;. The case attracted international attention from newspapers, medical professionals and the public. Rumours persist in the region that Sadler was visited by royalty for a &quot;laying on of hands&quot;. The local pub is the Bull and Butcher. Turville is well known for its carrots, and is informally referred to as the &quot;carrot capital&quot; of the United Kingdom. Turville Hill is a Site of Special Scientific Importance, and it includes Cobstone Windmill.

==Notable people==
*Geoffrey de Turville (died 1250), Lord Chancellor of Ireland
*Charles François Dumouriez (1739-1823), French royalist general
*Ellen Sadler (1859-1901), &quot;The Sleeping Girl of Turville&quot;, tourist attraction
*Lord Sainsbury of Turville (born 1940), businessman, politician, and philanthropist
*Sir John Mortimer, (1923-2009), Barrister, playwright, novelist

==Transport ==
There are no public transport routes (either bus or rail) that serve the village.

==In literature==

* Edward Mayhew, one of the two main characters in Ian McEwan&#x27;s &quot;On Chesil Beach&quot;, comes from Turville.

==Filming location ==

Turville is an English village, with several historic stone and timber houses around a village green. It has thus been used a filming location on numerous occasions:

The 1942 Ealing Studios film &quot;Went the Day Well?&quot;, in which German paratroopers invade a small English village, was filmed in Turville, as were many of the scenes from the 1963 comedy film &quot;Father Came Too!&quot; The whole of &quot;The Large Rope&quot;, a 1953 B-movie starring Donald Houston, was filmed in the village, as were the dream scene in &quot;Bride and Prejudice&quot; and a brief scene in &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot;. In June 2012, filming for the live-action Disney film Maleficent took place just outside the village. Cobstone Windmill in the neighbouring parish of Ibstone, used in &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, overlooks the village of Turville.

Additionally, many of the outdoor scenes of television show &quot;Goodnight Mr Tom&quot; were filmed in Turville. Scenes have also been shot in the village for &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;, &quot;Lewis&quot;, &quot;Marple&quot;, &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;, &quot;Little Britain&quot;, the 2008 Christmas special of &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;, the British drama &quot;An Education&quot; and the 2009 BBC adaptation of &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;. The fourth episode of the first series of &quot;Killing Eve&quot; was shot in the village, with an armed ambush and car chase shot in the village centre and on the surrounding country roads. The village was the location for outdoor scenes in the sitcom &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;. In the series, the church of St Mary the Virgin was renamed St Barnabus [&quot;sic&quot;].

The music video for the song &quot;Apparition&quot; by Stealing Sheep was shot in the village.

<text>Claire Curtis-Thomas (formerly Curtis-Tansley; born 30 April 1958) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Crosby from 1997 to 2010. Curtis-Thomas&#x27; time as an MP was most notable for her involvement in matters related to the challenges faced by the construction sector, supporting the expansion of apprenticeship schemes, and increasing the number of women in science, engineering and technology careers. In addition to challenging the legal processes involved in sex abuse cases. She had the highest amount of MP expenses claimed in the 2003-04 period.

==Early life==
Curtis-Thomas was educated at Mynyddbach Comprehensive School (since September 2001 known as Daniel James Community School after merging with the Penlan Boys School) on Heol Ddu, Treboeth, Swansea, and studied at University College, Cardiff where she was awarded a BSc degree in mechanical engineering, and at Aston University, where she obtained an MBA. She was awarded an honorary PhD in Technology in 1999.

She became a researcher at University College of Wales in Cardiff in 1984, before joining Shell Chemicals, initially as a site mechanical engineer, moving internally in 1988 as the Head of UK Supply and Distribution, and after 1990 was head of environmental strategy until leaving Shell in 1992. She became a research head and development laboratory at with the Birmingham City Council in 1992, before moving internally to be the strategy and business planning head in 1993, leaving the council in 1995. In 1996 she was appointed as a Business and Engineering Dean at the University of Wales, Newport, and remained there until the following year when she was elected to Westminster. She was elected as a councillor to the Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council in 1995, stepping down in 1997. Also in 1995, she was elected the secretary of the Eddisbury Constituency Labour Party.

==Parliamentary career==
She was elected to the House of Commons at her first attempt at the 1997 general election for the parliamentary constituency of Crosby. She defeated the sitting Conservative MP Malcolm Thornton by 7,182 votes, although her majority declined in the 2005 general election, standing at 5,840, holding approximately 69% of the vote in her constituency. She made her maiden speech, during a debate on the adjournment which she secured on the subject of engineering, on 31 July 1997.

On being elected to parliament she changed her name to Claire Curtis-Thomas, which was a combination of her mother&#x27;s maiden name of &#x27;Curtis&#x27; and her mother&#x27;s second husband&#x27;s surname, &#x27;Thomas&#x27;. After her election, she became a member of the Science and Technology Select Committee, on which she sat for the entirety of her first parliament. In 2003 she became a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, and after the 2005 General Election she has been a member of the Trade and Industry Committee.

She was one of the few engineers in Parliament and started an all-party parliamentary group Women in Science, Engineering and Design (WISED).

She was also involved with the Waterloo Partnership, a charity based in her constituency which raises money for Waterloo, Sierra Leone.

In June 2006, she introduced the Regulation of Sale and Display of Sexually Explicit Material Bill to stop newsagents selling certain men&#x27;s magazines. Because of a lack of parliamentary time, it never became law.

Her Crosby constituency disappeared under constituency boundary changes and was succeeded by Sefton Central, which is a Labour safe seat.

On 7 October 2009 Curtis-Thomas announced her decision to stand down at the 2010 general election.
Curtis-Thomas stated that her decision to stand down was due to the difficulty of continuing to represent her constituents and continue with family life given parliamentary hours.

==Personal life==
Claire married Philip Tansley in December 1984 in South Glamorgan, she was then divorced in 1995. She married Michael Lewis Jakub in December 1996 in Cheshire; they have a son together.

Curtis-Thomas stood for the 1997 election as Claire Curtis-Tansley.

She was baptised and confirmed in the Roman Catholic faith in November 2003.

She is the chief executive of the British Board of Agrément.

<doc id="419528" wikidata="Q628619" url="?curid=419528" title="Turweston">
<text>Turweston is a village and civil parish in north-west Buckinghamshire, England. The village is beside the River Great Ouse, which bounds the parish to the north, west and south. Turweston is the most northwesterly parish in Buckinghamshire: the Ouse here forms the county boundary with Northamptonshire to the north and west and Oxfordshire to the south. Across the river, the Northamptonshire market town of Brackley is just west of Turweston, with the town centre about west of the village. The parish has an area of and had a population of 211 at the 2011 Census.

==Toponym==
Turweston&#x27;s toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;Þorfrøthr&#x27;s village&quot;. The name reached its present form through &quot;Turvestone&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086; &quot;Thurneston&quot; and &quot;Turnestone&quot; in the 14th century; &quot;Turston, Tereweston, Turveston&quot; and &quot;Tower Weston&quot; in the 17th century and &quot;Turson&quot; in the 18th century.

==Manor==
In the 11th century in the reign of Edward the Confessor Wenesi, the king&#x27;s chamberlain, held a manor of five hides at Turweston. After the Norman conquest of England he was dispossessed and the Domesday Book records that Turweston was held by a Norman, William de Fougères. By 1278 the overlordship had passed to Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Mortimer, and it descended with his heirs the Earls of March until the 15th century. The Mortimers&#x27; mesne lords of Turweston were the Barons Zouche. The lesser lords of Turweston were the Scovill family until the 1280s, when the estate was escheated to the Crown. In 1292 Edward I bestowed the manor on Westminster Abbey. The Abbey retained Turweston after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s, and still held the manor in the 1920s.

Turweston manor house is in the main street. It was built in 1630 and enlarged in 1910. Many of its rooms and passages have 17th-century oak panelling, there are three 17th-century fireplaces and a late 17th-century staircase with carved balusters.

Turweston House is an early 18th-century Georgian country house overlooking the parish church. It is of seven bays, with a three-bay pediment at the centre. It is a Grade II* listed building.

==Church and chapel==
===Church of England===
The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of the Assumption of the blesséd Virgin Mary are Norman. The nave was built first, and the north aisle and its two-bay arcade were added in about 1190. One Norman window survives in the west wall of the north aisle.

In the middle of the 13th century the chancel was rebuilt with Early English Gothic lancet windows and piscina. Two of these lancets survive; one each in the south and north walls. The south aisle was added at the same time, and its surviving Early English details are a piscina and a lancet west window. The south aisle&#x27;s two-bay arcade was originally in the Transitional style between Norman and Early English. Only its east arch survives in this form, as in about 1360 its west arch was rebuilt. At the same time both aisles were widened, which is why the west window of the south aisle is now off-centre. In the 14th century in the chancel the lancet window on the south side was extended downwards to form a sedile and an ogeed and crocketted tomb recess was inserted in the north wall. The chancel east window is Perpendicular Gothic. The nave has a clerestory whose roof timbers are early 16th-century. Its tie-beams are moulded and have spandrels with cinquefoil tracery. The second stage of the west tower has a plain two-light window that is also 16th-century.

In 1863 the church was restored under the direction of the Oxford Diocesan Architect, G.E. Street. Street had the gable-roofed west tower rebuilt and a south porch added. He added a vestry and organ-chamber adjoining the north side of the chancel and east end of the north aisle. He also added a south chapel, inserting an arch between the chapel and south aisle and a two-bay arcade between the chapel and the chancel. Street re-used the windows that were removed from where the new arches were inserted: re-using and restoring the 14th-century east window from the south aisle as the east window of the chapel, and re-using the two windows from the south wall of the chancel as the chapel&#x27;s two south windows.

In the chancel are two monumental brasses. On the north side is an early 15th-century brass of a priest wearing his Mass vestments. On the south side are late 15th-century brass figures of Thomas Grene in civilian dress with his first and second wives, Joan and Agnes. The church has three 17th-century wall-mounted stone monuments. The most notable is a Jacobean one on the east wall of the north aisle, which has kneeling effigies of Simon Heynes (died 1628) and his wife with their baby, framed by Corinthian columns.

The stained glass in the east window of the south chapel was made by Thomas Willement in 1851. That in the east window of the chancel was made by Michael O&#x27;Connor in 1870.

The west tower has two early 17th-century bells, both cast by Robert Atton of Buckingham. The tenor was cast in 1625 and the treble in 1626. In 1913 the treble was reported to be &quot;badly cracked&quot;.

The church is a Grade II* listed building.

The advowson has been attached to the manor since at least the 13th century. Westminster Abbey has held the advowson since Edward I bestowed the manor upon the Abbey in 1292.

The parish of the Assumption is part of the Benefice of West Buckingham, along with the parishes of Biddlesden, Shalstone, Tingewick, Water Stratford and Westbury.

===Methodist===
A Wesleyan chapel was built in Turweston in 1861. The building is no longer used for worship but is now the Scout headquarters.

==Economic and social history==

Turweston has numerous stone cottages: several are 17th- or 18th-century; some are thatched. Manor Cottages were built in 1638 and altered in 1873. One late 17th-century cottage used to be the post office but has now reverted to a private home. The village had a school: it too was in a converted house and has now been converted back to a private home.
The village has two stone barns: one 18th-century and the other either 18th- or 17th-century. Parliament passed the (53 Geo. 3. c. cxliv) and the land award was made in 1814.

===Public house===
The Stratton Arms was built early in the 18th century and is named after a family that leased the manor from the mid-19th century until at least the 1920s.
It is now controlled by Enterprise Inns.

===Railways===
In the late 1840s the Buckinghamshire Railway&#x27;s line between and was built along part of the Ouse valley through the southwest of the parish, passing about south of the village. It opened in May 1850, with its nearest station being at from Turweston.

In the late 1890s the Great Central Main Line from Manchester and Sheffield to was also built through the southwest of the parish, passing about west of the village. It opened in March 1899 with its nearest station about away at .

British Railways renamed the Buckinghamshire Railway station Brackley Town in 1951 and closed it in 1961. BR closed the Buckinghamshire Railway line in 1963 and the GC Main Line in 1966. The village lies close to the path of High Speed 2. Much of Turweston lies within 300 yards (275 metres) of the railway&#x27;s path and this has brought property blight to the village and surrounding area. This issue was featured in an episode of the BBC consumer programme &quot;Rip Off Britain&quot; in October 2014, and a zero value rating placed upon the Old Post Office in Turweston, a Grade II Listed Building. This decision was later revised.
===Airfield===

East of the village is Turweston Airfield, which spans the parish&#x27;s eastern boundary with Biddlesden. The airfield opened in 1942 as an RAF Bomber Command Operational Training Unit. It is now a civilian airfield, conference centre, business park and rally school.

<doc id="419530" wikidata="Q2721877" url="?curid=419530" title="Rudi Vis">
<text>Rudolf Jan Vis (4 April 1941 – 30 May 2010) was a Dutch-born British Labour politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Finchley and Golders Green from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life==
Vis was born in 1941 in the town of Alkmaar, in the Netherlands, where he attended high school. He gained a BSc in economics from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1970 and was a graduate of the London School of Economics, gaining an MSc in economics in 1972.

He gained a PhD in economics from Brunel University in 1976. From 1971 to 1996, he was a lecturer at the North East London Polytechnic, which became the University of East London.

==Parliamentary career==
Vis was elected as MP for the newly drawn constituency of Finchley and Golders Green in the 1997 general election, defeating the Conservative MP John Marshall with a majority of 3,189 votes. This was one of Labour&#x27;s more unexpected victories – part of the constituency formed the Finchley constituency once held by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher – and Vis had not even taken leave of his post as an economics lecturer prior to the victory.

He was re-elected at 2001 with a slightly increased majority of 3,716, again defeating Conservative Party candidate John Marshall, but in 2005 his majority was greatly reduced to 741 votes, following an increase in support for the Liberal Democrats in the constituency. His constituency was one of the top Conservative targets at the 2010 general election, needing only a swing of 0.2% to the Tories. Knowing he was suffering from cancer, Vis stood down at the 2010 general election.

Vis sat on the Council of Europe. His views were generally, though not dogmatically, to the left-wing of the party. He abstained in the mayoral candidate selection of 2000. He opposed the use of PPP for the London Underground, the war on Iraq, top-up fees and foundation hospitals. However, he voted in favour of the government&#x27;s controversial counter-terrorism legislation.

==Expenses scandal==

On 5 April 2009 &quot;The Times&quot; reported that he had used his parliamentary expenses to help buy a £520,000 home for his retirement near the Suffolk coast having taken out a mortgage on his London home to pay for the country property. By informing the parliamentary authorities that his main home had moved to Suffolk, he was able to claim the interest payments on the loan secured on his London home. Over the previous two years, he had claimed more than £40,000. &quot;The rules are questionable,&quot; Vis said, &quot;but this is well within the rules and I would have been advised if it wasn&#x27;t.&quot;

He was also discovered to have claimed £5,292 for 15,168 miles of travel between Parliament and his home nine miles away.

==Death==
Rudi Vis died in his sleep on 30 May 2010 from cancer diagnosed five months earlier.

<doc id="419532" wikidata="Q1994936" url="?curid=419532" title="Twyford, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Twyford is a village and civil parish in the Aylesbury Vale district of Buckinghamshire, England. It is about west of Steeple Claydon and northeast of Bicester in Oxfordshire.

Twyford&#x27;s toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;double ford&quot;. It is a common name in England.

The village has a Church of England parish church, a URC chapel and a Church of England primary school. There is one public house, one general store which is community owned and run by volunteers.

==Parish church==
The Church of England parish church of the Assumption of the Blesséd Virgin Mary is 12th-century, with four-bay 13th-century nave arcades and a 14th-century west tower. Monuments in the church include a large baroque one in the south aisle commemorating Richard Wenman, 1st Viscount Wenman, and a smaller one to his father Thomas Wenman.

The tower has a ring of six bells. The fifth bell was cast by an unidentified bellfounder in about 1599. W&amp;J Taylor cast the treble bell in 1828 at their then foundry in Oxford. William Blew and Sons of Birmingham cast the fourth bell in 1869. Gillett &amp; Johnston of Croydon cast the treble, second and third bells in 1907. There is also a Sanctus bell that was cast in about 1699.

The church is a Grade I listed building.

==Amenities==

Twyford&#x27;s one public house is The Crown Inn. There used to be three, but The Red Lion was converted and closed in 1994 and The Seven Stars was converted and closed soon after.

Twyford Church of England School is a mixed, voluntary controlled infants&#x27; school for the 4–11 age range. The school once taught as few as 25 pupils, but has since recovered to its highest class numbers ever, at just over 100.

Twyford Village Stores is a community shop and coffee shop ran by volunteers. A community shop opened on Main Street, however the community shop then moved into a temporary building after closing in 2010. Twyford Village Stores replaced this building as the location for the community shop in 2014, after being unveiled by the former local MP

==Notable residents==
Two brothers who achieved high episcopal office, Euseby Cleaver (1746–1819), Archbishop of Dublin, and William Cleaver (1742–1815), Bishop of Bangor, were born in Twyford, where their father was headmaster of the local boys school.

<text>Christopher David Mole (born 16 March 1958) is a British Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament for Ipswich from a by-election in 2001, after the death of Jamie Cann, and was re-elected in 2005. He was Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Transport, until his defeat in the 2010 general election by Ben Gummer of the Conservative Party.

==Early life==
Mole attended Dulwich College. He gained a degree in Electronics from the University of Kent and moved to Ipswich in 1981 to work at the BT Laboratories at Martlesham Heath. During that time he served as Branch Secretary of the Research Branch of the white collar BT-only union then called the STE. It is now a cross industry union called Connect.

He was first elected to Suffolk County Council in 1985 and represented a central Ipswich division for 18 years. He was Deputy Chair of EEDA, the regional development agency for the East of England, from 1998 and was Leader of Suffolk County Council from 1993, named Council of the Year 2001, until his election as Member of Parliament. He was a governor of Handford Hall Primary School, Ipswich.

==Parliamentary career==
In the 2001 parliament, Mole served as a member of the Select Committee that scrutinised the work of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Deregulation and Regulatory Affairs Select Committee and the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. He steered his Private Member&#x27;s Bill onto the Statute Book where it became the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003, extending the concept of legal deposit to electronic records; the Bill was strongly promoted by the British Library

Mole was appointed in June 2005 to the position of Parliamentary Private Secretary PPS to the Local Government Minister Phil Woolas. He resigned from this position on 6 September 2006 after signing a letter calling on Prime Minister Tony Blair to step down. When Gordon Brown became Prime Minister, Mole was recalled to a PPS position, taking the post of PPS to John Healey, the Minister of State for the Department for Communities and Local Government on 28 June 2007. From 16 January 2007 until 20 August 2008, Mole was a member of the Science and Technology Committee.

In October 2008 he was made an Assistant Whip in the Labour government and acted as Assistant Regional Minister with Barbara Follett, the Regional Minister for the East of England. He became a minister for the first time in the June 2009 reshuffle when he was appointed to the Department for Transport as a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.

In November 2008, he wrote a &quot;strongly worded&quot; letter to BBC Director-General Mark Thompson, demanding that &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenter Jeremy Clarkson be sacked when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes.

==Personal life==
He lives in East Ipswich with his wife Shona (née Gibb), a systems analyst for BT in Ipswich, and their two sons Edward (born 1991) and Thomas (born 1994).

Since leaving the House of Commons in 2010, Chris has volunteered at the Ipswich and Suffolk Credit Union, becoming their general manager in June 2011.

<text>Franklin District was a New Zealand territorial authority that lay between the Auckland metropolitan area and the Waikato Plains. As a formal territory, it was abolished on 31 October 2010 and divided between Auckland Council in the Auckland Region (39.82 percent by land area) to the north and Waikato and Hauraki districts in the Waikato region (60.18 percent) to the south and east. The Auckland portion is now part of the Franklin Ward, which also includes rural parts of the former Manukau City.

Before its abolition, it was administered from the town of Pukekohe. Out-going Franklin District Mayor Mark Ball had proposed that Franklin District become an independent unitary authority, fulfilling both the functions of a local and regional council. However, this was rejected by Minister Rodney Hide.

==Location and extent==

The district was bounded in the north by the start of the Auckland metropolitan area and the waters of the Manukau Harbour. Awhitu Peninsula stretches up the Tasman coast to the mouth of this harbour. Here are located several holiday spots, such as Karioitahi Beach and Matakawau.

To the south, Franklin was bounded by the fertile lowlands of the Waikato Plains. In the east, the land rises to the Hunua Ranges, then falls to the coast of the Firth of Thames. In the west is the Tasman Sea. The Waikato River mouth is at Port Waikato in the south of the region. This is renowned as a good place for surfcasting.

The area is mainly rural, with local settlements such as Waiuku and Tuakau supporting the farming industry. One industry of note is the New Zealand Steel steel mill at Glenbrook, north of Waiuku.

==Mayors==
Six people served as mayor of Franklin District during its 21-year existence:
== Nomenclature ==
The name of &quot;Franklin&quot; probably derives from Lady Jane Franklin, an early British traveller and the wife of Captain Sir John Franklin,
who served as Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (1837–1843). Lady Franklin visited the Waikato Heads in 1841.

==Media==
&quot;Franklin County News&quot;, a twice-weekly newspaper based in Pukekohe, serves the former Franklin District. &quot;The Post Newspaper&quot; distributes 26,000 printed copies weekly on a Tuesday, covering Franklin and North Waikato. &quot;The Post Newspaper&quot; has an office in both Pukekohe and Waiuku. In 2015, the online events calendar and photo news Franklin Life NZ was launched.

<doc id="419544" wikidata="Q1427211" url="?curid=419544" title="Flash Airlines Flight 604">
<text>Flash Airlines Flight 604 was a charter flight from Sharm El Sheikh International Airport in Egypt to Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris, France, with a stop-over at Cairo International Airport, provided by Egyptian private charter company Flash Airlines. On 3 January 2004, the Boeing 737-300 that was operating the route crashed into the Red Sea shortly after takeoff from Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, killing all 135 passengers, most of whom were French tourists, and all thirteen crew members. The findings of the crash investigation were controversial, with accident investigators from the different countries involved unable to agree on the cause of the accident.

Flight 604 was the deadliest air disaster in Egypt until it was surpassed almost twelve years later by the bombing of Metrojet Flight 9268. It remains the deadliest accident involving a 737 Classic aircraft.

== History of the flight ==

=== Aircraft ===

The aircraft involved, manufactured in October 1992, was an 11-year-old Boeing 737-3Q8 powered by two CFM International CFM56-3C1 engines. At the time of the accident, it had accumulated around 25,600 flight hours and 18,000 cycles of takeoffs and landings.

=== Crew ===
The captain of Flight 604 was 53-year-old Khedr Abdullah. He was a highly respected pilot who had accrued almost 7,500 hours of flight time, including 474 hours on the Boeing 737. The first officer was 25-year-old Amr al-Shaafei who had fewer than 800 hours of flying experience, with 242 of them on the Boeing 737. 42-year-old Ashraf Abdelhamid, who was training as a first officer and had experience flying corporate jets, sat in the cockpit with the pilot and co-pilot. Though Egyptian, Abdelhamid also held Canadian and U.S. citizenships.

=== Passengers ===
Most of the passengers aboard the flight were French tourists from the Paris metropolitan area. A provisional passenger list, dated 5 January 2004, stated that twelve entire French families had boarded the flight. Members of only seventeen families appeared at Charles de Gaulle Airport to meet passengers off the flight; this gave an indication to the airport staff that entire families had died on Flight 604.

== Accident ==
The aircraft departed from Sharm El Sheikh International Airport at 04:42 EET (02:42 UTC) on 3 January 2004. After taking off, it made a left turn to intercept the airport&#x27;s VOR system, and the autopilot was then engaged.

Shortly afterwards, however, Captain Khedr made an unintelligible exclamation and the autopilot abruptly disconnected (this might have been an intentional action by the pilots or it may have happened automatically). At this point the aircraft entered a right bank of 40 degrees. When the bank reached 50 degrees, First Officer al-Shaafei called out &quot;overbank,&quot; indicating that the aircraft&#x27;s bank was becoming dangerous. The bank angle increased rapidly until it reached 111 degrees at which point the aircraft entered a stall. It crashed into the Red Sea at 04:45 EET (02:45 UTC), just three minutes after takeoff, at a speed of at a right bank angle of 24 degrees and at a nose-down angle of 24 degrees. The tail broke off of the plane and rolled forward after the crash into the sea. All 148 people on board perished.

== Investigation ==
Initially, it was thought that terrorists might have been involved, as fear of aviation terrorism was high (with several major airlines in previous days cancelling flights on short notice). The British Prime Minister at the time, Tony Blair, was also on holiday in the Sharm El Sheikh area. A group in Yemen said that it destroyed the aircraft as retaliation against a new law in France banning headscarves in schools. Accident investigators dismissed terrorism when they discovered that the wreckage was in a tight debris field, indicating that the aircraft crashed in one piece; a bombed aircraft would have disintegrated and left a large debris field.

The wreckage sank to a depth of , making recovery of the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) difficult. However two weeks after the accident, both devices were located by a French salvage vessel and recovered by a ROV. The accident investigators examined the recorders while in Cairo. The maintenance records of the aircraft had not been duplicated; they were destroyed in the crash and no backup copies existed.

The Ministry of Civil Aviation (MCA) investigated the accident, with assistance from the American National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA).

The MCA released its final report into the accident on 25 March 2006. The report did not conclude with a probable cause, listing instead four &quot;possible causes.&quot;

The NTSB and the BEA concluded that the pilot suffered spatial disorientation and the copilot was unwilling to challenge his more experienced superior. Furthermore, according to the NTSB and BEA, both officers were insufficiently trained. The NTSB stated that the cockpit voice recorder showed that 24 seconds passed after the airliner banked before the pilot began corrective maneuvers. Egyptian authorities disagreed with this assessment, instead blaming mechanical issues. Shaker Kelada, the lead Egyptian investigator, said that if Hamid, who had more experience than the copilot, detected any problems with the flight, he would have raised objections. Some media reports suggest that the plane crashed due to technical problems, possibly a result of the airline&#x27;s apparently questionable safety record. This attitude was shown in a press briefing given by the BEA chief who was berated by the first officer&#x27;s mother during a press conference, and demanded that the crew be absolved of fault prior to the completion of the investigation. Two months after the crash, Flash Airlines declared bankruptcy.

According to an excerpt from page five of the U.S.&#x27;s comments on the final report of this accident:

&quot;Distraction. A few seconds before the captain called for the autopilot to be engaged, the aircraft&#x27;s pitch began increasing and airspeed began decreasing. These deviations continued during and after the autopilot engagement/disengagement sequence. The captain ultimately allowed the airspeed to decrease to below his commanded target airspeed of and the climb pitch to reach 22°, which is 10° more than the standard climb pitch of about 12°. During this time, the captain also allowed the aircraft to enter a gradually steepening right bank, which was inconsistent with the flight crew&#x27;s departure clearance to perform a climbing left turn. These pitch, airspeed and bank angle deviations indicated that the captain directed his attention away from monitoring the attitude indications during and after the autopilot disengagement process.
Changes in the autoflight system&#x27;s mode status offer the best explanation for the captain&#x27;s distraction. The following changes occurred in the autoflight system&#x27;s mode status shortly before the initiation of the right roll: (1) manual engagement of the autopilot, (2) automatic transition of roll guidance from heading select to control wheel steering-roll (CWS-R), (3) manual disengagement of the autopilot, and (4) manual reengagement of heading select for roll guidance. The transition to the CWS-R mode occurred in accordance with nominal system operation because the captain was not closely following the flight director guidance at the time of the autopilot engagement. The captain might not have expected the transition, and he might not have understood why it occurred. The captain was probably referring to the mode change from command mode to CWS-R when he stated, &quot;see what the aircraft did?,&quot; shortly after it occurred. The available evidence indicates that the unexpected mode change and the flight crew&#x27;s subsequent focus of attention on reestablishing roll guidance for the autoflight system were the most likely reasons for the captain&#x27;s distraction from monitoring the attitude.&quot;

Problems associated with the complexity of autopilot systems were documented in the June 2008 issue of Aero Safety World. Before the completion of the investigation, &quot;Avionics&quot; writer David Evans suggested that differences in artificial horizon instrumentation between the MiG-21 (with which the captain had experience) and the Boeing 737 may have contributed to the crash.

==In popular culture==
The Discovery Channel Canada / National Geographic TV series &quot;Mayday&quot; (also called &quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot; or &quot;Air Emergency&quot;) depicted the accident in a 2007 episode titled &quot;Vertigo&quot;.

<doc id="419548" wikidata="Q4584826" url="?curid=419548" title="Tyringham">
<text>Tyringham (/ˈtiːrɪŋəm/) is a village in the unitary authority area of the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. It is located about a mile and a half north of Newport Pagnell.

The village name is an Old English language word, and means &#x27;Tir&#x27;s home&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Telingham&quot;.

There is a theory that the name Tyringham refers to a settlement of Thuringii Germans coming with the Anglo-Saxons in the Dark Ages.

==Civil parish==
Historically, the parish of &quot;Tyringham with Filgrave&quot; (or &quot;Tyringham cum Filgrave&quot;) was first created in 1639 by the union of two parishes.

The modern civil parish is Tyringham and Filgrave, consisting of these two villages and their surrounding area. At the 2001 census, the population of the parish was 190.

Historically, Tyringham on its own once contained only two houses, but was a village in its own right because it had an ecclesiastic parish.

<doc id="419549" wikidata="Q335100" url="?curid=419549" title="Sylvia Browne">
<text>Sylvia Celeste Browne (&quot;née&quot; Shoemaker; October 19, 1936 – November 20, 2013) was an American writer and self-proclaimed medium and psychic. She appeared regularly on television and radio, including on &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot; and &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, and hosted an hour-long online radio show on Hay House Radio.

Browne frequently made pronouncements that were later found to be false, including those related to missing persons. In 1992, she pleaded no contest to securities fraud. Despite the considerable negative publicity, she maintained a large following until her death in 2013.

== Early life ==
Sylvia Browne grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, the daughter of William Lee and Celeste (née Coil) Shoemaker. Her father held several different jobs, working at times in mail delivery, jewelry sales, and as a vice president of a freight line. Although Browne was raised mostly as a Catholic, she was said to have an Episcopalian mother, a Lutheran maternal grandmother, Jewish father, and relatives from all these faiths.&lt;ref name= &quot;CNN0103/06&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Browne said that she started seeing visions at the age of three, and that her grandmother, who she said was also a psychic medium, helped her understand what they meant. Browne also said her great-uncle was a psychic medium and was &quot;rabid about UFOs&quot;.

== Career ==
Browne started working as a psychic in 1973. In 1986, she founded a &quot;Gnostic Christian&quot; church in Campbell, California, known as the Society of Novus Spiritus. She was also head of the Sylvia Browne Corporation and Sylvia Browne Enterprises. In a 2010 interview, Browne&#x27;s business manager said that her businesses earned $3 million a year.

Browne said she observed Heaven and angels. She also professed the ability to speak with a spirit guide named Francine, and to perceive a wide range of &quot;vibrational frequencies&quot;.

=== Books ===
Browne authored some 40 books on paranormal topics, some of which appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. Many of these books were acknowledged as resulting from collaborations with other writers such as Lindsay Harrison and Chris Dufresne.

=== Television and radio ===
Browne was a frequent guest on US television and radio programs, including &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible!&quot;, and &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;. During these appearances, she usually discussed her purported abilities with the host and then performed readings for audience members or callers. On certain occasions she was paired with other guests, including skeptics, often leading to debate about the authenticity of Browne&#x27;s psychic abilities. Browne hosted her own hour-long online radio show on Hay House Radio, where she performed readings and discussed paranormal issues.

Browne appeared in a 1991 episode of &quot;Haunted Lives: True Ghost Stories&quot;. In the segment &quot;Ghosts R Us&quot;, she portrayed herself in a recreation of events that purportedly took place in a haunted Toys R Us store. Browne also appeared as herself on the CBS television soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in December 2006.

== False predictions ==
Browne made many public pronouncements which were subsequently proven false. Among the more notable incidents were the following:
* In 2002, Browne informed the parents of 11-year-old Shawn Hornbeck, who had disappeared earlier that year, that he had been kidnapped by a dark-skinned Hispanic man with dreadlocks and was now deceased. Hornbeck was found alive in 2007; his kidnapper was Caucasian and short-haired. In June 2008, the UK television network ITV2 was sanctioned by Ofcom for re-airing the episode of &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot; featuring Browne&#x27;s original prediction.
* In November 2004, Browne told the mother of kidnapping victim Amanda Berry, who had disappeared nineteen months earlier: &quot;She&#x27;s not alive, honey.&quot; Browne also said that Berry was &quot;in water&quot;, and that she had had a vision of Berry&#x27;s jacket in the garbage with &quot;DNA on it&quot;. Berry&#x27;s mother died two years later believing her daughter had been killed. Berry was found alive in May 2013.
* On &quot;Larry King Live&quot; in 2003, Browne predicted that she would die at age 88. She died in 2013, at age 77.

=== Psychic detective cases ===
In 2000, &quot;Brill&#x27;s Content&quot; examined ten recent &quot;Montel Williams&quot; episodes that highlighted Browne&#x27;s work as a psychic detective, spanning 35 cases. In 21 cases, the information predicted by Browne was too vague to be verified. Of the remaining 14, law enforcement officials or family members stated Browne had played no useful role.

In 2010, the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; published a detailed three-year study by Ryan Shaffer and Agatha Jadwiszczok that examined Browne&#x27;s predictions about missing persons and murder cases. Despite her repeated claims to be more than 85% correct, the study reported that &quot;Browne has not even been mostly correct in a single case.&quot; The study compared Browne&#x27;s televised statements about 115 cases with newspaper reports and found that in the 25 cases where the actual outcome was known, she was completely wrong in every one. In the rest, where the outcome was unknown, her predictions could not be substantiated. The study concluded that the media outlets that repeatedly promoted Browne&#x27;s work had no visible concern about whether she was untrustworthy or harmed people.

Among the predictions examined in the study were the following:
* In 1999, Browne said that six-year-old Opal Jo Jennings, who had disappeared a month earlier, had been forced into slavery in Japan. Later that year, a local man was convicted of kidnapping and murdering Jennings. In 2003, an autopsy of Jennings&#x27; remains found that she had died within hours of her abduction.
* In 2002, Browne said that Holly Krewson, who had disappeared in 1995, was working as an exotic dancer in a Hollywood nightclub. In 2006, dental records were used to positively identify a body found in 1996 in San Diego as Krewson&#x27;s.
* In 2002, Browne said that Lynda McClelland, who had disappeared in 2000, had been taken by a man with the initials &quot;MJ&quot;, was alive in Orlando, Florida, and would be found soon. In 2003, McClelland&#x27;s son-in-law David Repasky, who had been present at Browne&#x27;s reading, was convicted of murdering McClelland; her remains were found near her home in Pennsylvania.
* In 2004, Browne said that Ryan Katcher, a 19-year-old who had disappeared in 2000, had been murdered, and his body could be found in a metal shaft. In 2006, Katcher&#x27;s body was found in his truck at the bottom of a pond, where he had drowned.

In a 2013 follow-up article, Shaffer reviewed more recent predictions by Browne, as well as predictions whose outcomes had been earlier classified as undetermined but were now largely resolved. According to Shaffer, Browne was mostly or completely wrong in 33 cases and mostly accurate in none.

=== Sago Mine disaster ===
On January 2, 2006, an explosion at Sago mine in West Virginia trapped several miners underground. The following day, Browne was a guest on the radio program &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; with George Noory. At the start of the broadcast, it was believed that twelve of thirteen miners trapped by the disaster had been found alive and, when Noory asked Browne if the reported lack of noise from inside the mine might have led her to think the men had died, she replied, &quot;No; I knew they were going to be found.&quot; Later in the program, it was discovered that the earlier news reports had been in error; Browne said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anybody alive, maybe one ... I just don&#x27;t think they are alive&quot;, adding, subsequently, that she &quot;didn&#x27;t believe that they were alive ... I did believe that they were gone.&quot;

==Popularity==
Browne cultivated a large following. In 2007, she had a four-year waiting list for readings by telephone. That same year, hundreds of people joined Browne on a cruise, each paying thousands of dollars for psychic readings. Many of her books became staples on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

Browne attracted media attention seven years after her death, when social media users claimed that a prediction in her books (&quot;End of Days&quot; and &quot;Prophecy: What the Future Holds For You&quot;) referred to the COVID-19 pandemic (she claimed &quot;a severe pneumonia-like illness&quot; would spread &quot;around&quot; 2020). News coverage of the alleged similarity appeared in March 2020, and was picked up by celebrities with large social media platforms such as Kim Kardashian. Investigator Benjamin Radford and others dismissed the one-paragraph prediction as too generic, and actually more akin to the 2003 SARS epidemic, than to COVID-19. Radford said that as Browne had produced predictions by the thousands, &quot;the fact that this one happened to possibly, maybe, be partly right is meaningless.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Browne was frequently condemned by skeptics. Robert S. Lancaster maintained an exhaustive record of her inaccurate predictions and criminal activity, and described her pronouncements relating to missing children as &quot;incredibly offensive&quot;. Jon Ronson, who called Browne &quot;America&#x27;s most controversial psychic&quot;, wrote that she was often &quot;psychically wrong&quot; and made &quot;a fortune saying very serious, cruel, show-stopping things to people in distress&quot;. Fox News noted that she was &quot;often criticized for her predictions&quot;; Browne also garnered disapproval from others who claim to be psychics.

=== James Randi ===
Browne&#x27;s most vocal critic within the skeptical movement was James Randi, a retired stage magician and investigator of paranormal claims; Randi claimed that Browne&#x27;s accuracy rate was no better than educated guessing. On September 3, 2001, Browne stated on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; that she would prove her legitimacy by accepting the James Randi Educational Foundation&#x27;s One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge to demonstrate supernatural abilities in a controlled scientific test. By April 2003, however, Browne had not contacted Randi to make testing arrangements.

On May 16, 2003, in another appearance on King&#x27;s show, Browne said she had not taken the test because Randi refused to place the prize money in escrow. Randi responded by mailing a notarized copy of the prize account status showing a balance in excess of one million dollars; Browne refused to accept the letter. In late 2003, despite challenge rules that money could not be placed in escrow, Randi announced that he was willing to do so for Browne; she did not accept or acknowledge this offer. In 2005, Browne posted a message online that she had never received confirmation of the prize money&#x27;s existence, despite Randi&#x27;s claim that he had a certified mail receipt showing Browne&#x27;s refusal of the package. In 2007, on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot;, Browne&#x27;s business manager Linda Rossi stated that Browne would not be taking Randi&#x27;s challenge &quot;because she has nothing to prove to James Randi&quot;.

=== John Oliver ===
In a 2019 segment of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot;, John Oliver criticized the media for promoting Browne and other psychics and enabling them to prey on grieving families. Oliver said, &quot;When psychic abilities are presented as authentic, it emboldens a vast underworld of unscrupulous vultures, more than happy to make money by offering an open line to the afterlife, as well as many other bullshit services.&quot;

== Fraud conviction ==
During the late 1980s, the FBI and local authorities began investigating Browne and her businesses over several bank loans that caused &quot;sustained losses&quot; to banks. In 1992, Browne and her then-husband Kenzil Dalzell Brown were indicted on several charges of investment fraud and grand theft. The Superior Court of Santa Clara County, California, found Browne and her husband had sold securities in a gold-mining venture under false pretenses. In at least one instance, they told a couple that their $20,000 investment was to be used for immediate operating costs. Instead, the money was transferred to an account for their Nirvana Foundation for Psychic Research. Browne pleaded no contest to securities fraud and was indicted on grand larceny in Santa Clara County on May 26, 1992. The couple each received one year probation. In addition, Browne was sentenced to 200 hours of community service.

== Personal life ==
Browne married four times. Her first marriage, from 1959 to 1972, was to Gary Dufresne. The couple had two sons, Paul and Christopher. She took the surname Brown upon her third marriage, and later changed it to Browne. Her fourth marriage took place on February 14, 2009, to Michael Ulery, the owner of a jewelry store.

In March 2011, the Society of Novus Spiritus, the Gnostic Christian Church founded by Browne, announced that she had suffered a heart attack on March 21 in Hawaii, requesting donations on her behalf.

Browne died on November 20, 2013, aged 77, at Good Samaritan Hospital in San Jose, California. Her interment was at Oak Hill Memorial Park.

<text>Alphonse Dante Bichette Sr. (; born November 18, 1963) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as an outfielder for the California Angels (1988–1990), Milwaukee Brewers (1991–1992), Colorado Rockies (1993–1999), Cincinnati Reds (2000), and Boston Red Sox (2000–2001). He was also the hitting coach for the Rockies in 2013. He batted and threw right-handed.

Bichette was a four-time All-Star as a member of the Rockies, and was a member of the 1993 inaugural team. In 1995, he won the Silver Slugger Award and finished second in the Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting while leading the National League in home runs, slugging percentage, and total bases, along with leading the entire MLB in hits and runs batted in (RBIs). The next year, he joined the 30–30 club with 31 home runs and 31 stolen bases, and in 1998, again led the league in hits with 219. Each year from 1993−1998 he batted over .300, and in each year from 1995−1999, drove in at least 100 runs.

==Career==
===Professional career===
Bichette attended Jupiter High School in Jupiter, Florida, and Palm Beach Community College. The California Angels drafted Bichette in the 17th round of the 1984 Major League Baseball draft.

Bichette made his MLB debut with the Angels in 1988, but was a streaky hitter and was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for Dave Parker in 1991. After putting up only average numbers with Milwaukee, he was traded to the new expansion team, the Colorado Rockies. On April 7, 1993, he hit the first home-run in Rockies history, a solo shot off New York Mets pitcher Bret Saberhagen. Bichette was part of the &quot;Blake Street Bombers&quot; which also included sluggers Larry Walker, Andrés Galarraga, Ellis Burks, and Vinny Castilla.

He finished the Rockies&#x27; first season with 21 home runs and a .310 batting average, his personal best for both at the time. Bichette also hit his first home run at the newly constructed Coors Field, a 14th-inning smash against the Mets that secured an opening day victory for the Rockies in 1995. Bichette had his best season in 1995, coming very close to the Triple Crown with a .340 batting average, 40 home runs and 128 RBIs and barely lost the MVP voting to the Cincinnati Reds&#x27; Barry Larkin.

Bichette, tall and weighing , began having knee problems in 1996, but was still successful as a hitter, with a .316 average, 31 home runs and 141 RBIs, plus 31 stolen bases. The 1996 season was only the second time ever that two players on the same team hit at least 30 home runs and collected 30 stolen bases, as Ellis Burks accomplished the same feat. Over the next three seasons, Bichette hit 26, 22 and 34 home runs for the Rockies. He remains in the top ten in many offensive categories for the Rockies. On June 10, 1998, Bichette became the first player to hit for the cycle in an interleague game, when he accomplished the feat against the Texas Rangers, capping it off with a walk-off single to win the game for the Rockies in 10 innings.

On April 4, 1999, the Rockies made history as they played their Opening Day contest at Estadio de Béisbol Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico, marking the first time Major League Baseball (MLB) commenced the regular season outside of the United States or Canada. Their opponent was the defending National League champion San Diego Padres. Bichette collected four hits, drove in four runs, and homered as Colorado won 8–2.

By the end of the 1999 season, his production was beginning to drop and the Rockies dealt Bichette to the Cincinnati Reds. However, his fielding was suffering tremendously and Bichette was eventually traded to the Boston Red Sox for a season and a half and then the Los Angeles Dodgers. Bichette retired before ever playing a game with the Dodgers, on March 22, 2002.

In August 2004, Bichette rejoined professional baseball as a designated hitter, pitcher and occasional outfielder for the Atlantic League&#x27;s Nashua Pride. Bichette won the Atlantic League&#x27;s Player of the Month award for August (his first full month back). He completed the month with a .361 average and 13 homers. On August 28, he batted 4-for-5 with two home runs and eight RBIs.

===Coaching career===
On November 13, 2012, Bichette was hired to be the Colorado Rockies hitting coach, replacing Carney Lansford. He announced on September 24, 2013 that he would not return for the 2014 season.

On July 24, 2020, it was confirmed during the opening game of the Toronto Blue Jays season that Bichette had been added to the Jays coaching staff full-time after the summer camp.

On February 4, 2021, it was announced that Bichette would be reassigned as a special assistant within the Blue Jays&#x27; organization &quot;to continue to have an impact throughout multiple levels of the organization.&quot; On February 9, 2022, Bichette left his position with the Blue Jays so he could train with his son, Bo. Due to the ongoing 2021–22 Major League Baseball lockout, Bichette had been unable to train with Bo and prioritized family over his position.

==Career statistics==
In 1,704 games over 14 seasons, Bichette posted a .299 batting average (1906-for-6381) with 934 runs, 401 doubles, 27 triples, 274 home runs, 1141 RBI, 152 stolen bases, 355 base on balls, .336 on-base percentage and .499 slugging percentage. He recorded a .974 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions. In his only postseason appearance, in the 1995 NLDS, he hit .588 (10-for-17) with six runs, three doubles, one home run and three RBI.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Bichette was arrested in Palm Beach County after reports of a domestic dispute with his pregnant girlfriend, Mariana Peng. Police responded to another incident involving Bichette and Peng the following year at his off-season home in Palm Beach Gardens.

In August 2005, Bichette&#x27;s oldest son Dante Jr., participated in the Little League World Series with his Maitland, Florida, team. Bichette was one of the team&#x27;s two assistant coaches, the other being former MLB player Mike Stanley. Dante Jr. was drafted 51st overall by the New York Yankees in 2011. Bichette&#x27;s younger son, Bo, was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 2016 draft, and made his MLB debut on July 29, 2019. Both Bo and Dante, Jr. played for Brazil in the 2017 World Baseball Classic qualifier tournament; their mother Mariana is a native of Porto Alegre, Brazil (their maternal grandfather is a native of China who immigrated to Brazil).

On June 11, 2024, Bichette&#x27;s son Dante Jr., alleged that he had been abused by the elder Dante as a child while playing youth baseball.

<text>Seydou Elimane Diarra (23 November 1933 – 19 July 2020) was an Ivorian politician, who served as the Prime Minister in 2000 and again from 2003 to 2005.

==Life and career==
Diarra was born on 23 November 1933 in Katiola. Prior to joining the government, he was an Ambassador to the European Economic Community and Brazil and was President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Ivory Coast. After the December 1999 military coup, he was appointed Minister of State for Planning, Development, and Government Cooperation on 4 January 2000, under transitional President Robert Guéï. He was subsequently Prime Minister from May 2000 to October 2000.

He was again appointed Prime Minister in February 2003 as part of a deal to end the 2002-2003 civil war, due to his position as a neutral figure at the time; however, many supporters of President Laurent Gbagbo accused him of not taking a strong stance against the rebels, despite their failure to disarm in October 2004, and demanded his resignation.

On 5 December 2005, African Union mediators announced that Diarra was to be replaced by Charles Konan Banny, effective on 7 December.

=== Education ===
Seydou Diarra was originally from the north of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and a Muslim. A scholarship holder from the French Republic, he studied in La Rochelle and then obtained a diploma in agricultural engineering from the École nationale supérieure agronomique de Montpellier.

==Death==
Diarra died in Abidjan on 19 July 2020, at the age of 86.

<doc id="419556" wikidata="Q2030846" url="?curid=419556" title="Upper Winchendon">
<text>Upper Winchendon or Over Winchendon is a village and civil parish in the Aylesbury Vale District of Buckinghamshire, England. It is about south of Waddesdon and west of Aylesbury. A mid-air collision on 17 November 2017 between a plane and a helicopter just outside the village was referred to by much of the press as the &quot;Waddesdon Manor air incident&quot;.

==Name==
The name &quot;Winchendon&quot; is derived from the Old English for &quot;hill at a bend&quot;. Collectively the villages of Upper Winchendon and Nether Winchendon (or Lower Winchendon) were called &quot;Wichendone&quot;.

==Manor==
The manor of Upper Winchendon was held by St Frideswide&#x27;s Priory in Oxford, to whom it was given by King Henry I. After the suppression of the convent in the Dissolution of the Monasteries the manor was given to Cardinal Wolsey, but was seized by the Crown shortly afterwards, in 1530, along with Wolsey&#x27;s other estates.

In 1623 the manor was granted by the Crown to the Goodwin family, who enlarged the manor house into a mansion. It then passed into the Wharton family, one of whom was made the Duke of Wharton in 1718 for his services to the Crown. He later had all his possessions seized for being a supporter of the Young Pretender (Bonnie Prince Charlie). The house fell into disrepair thereafter and has since been demolished.

==Notable people==
In birth order.
*Cardinal Wolsey (1473–1530), cardinal and politician, was briefly lord of the manor up to 1530, when he fell from favour.
*Sir Francis Goodwin (1564–1634), politician, was lord of the manor of Upper Winchendon and an MP for Buckinghamshire.
*Arthur Goodwin (died 1643), lawyer and Parliamentarian, was lord of the manor of Upper Winchendon.
*Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton (1613–1696), soldier, Parliamentarian and art collector, gained the manor of Upper Winchendon through his second wife, Jane Goodwin, only daughter of Arthur Goodwin. He and other family were painted by Anthony van Dyck.
*Samuel Clarke (1626–1701), nonconformist minister and Biblical scholar, spent 26 years in Upper Winchendon under the auspices of Philip Wharton, after ejection from the rectory of Grendon Underwood in 1662, and set up on an Independent congregation there.
*Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton (1648–1714), Whig politician, rake and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, was the eldest son of Philip Wharton. The lyrics of the marching song &quot;Lillibullero&quot; are attributed to him. He was buried at Upper Winchendon.
*Goodwin Wharton (1653–1704), Whig politician and autobiographer, was born in Upper Winchendon on 8 March 1653 as third son of Philip Wharton.
*Anne Wharton (1659–1685), wife of Thomas Wharton, was a poet and dramatist.

==2017 mid-air collision==
On 17 November 2017, a mid-air collision occurred between an aeroplane and a helicopter near Waddesdon Manor, resulting in four deaths, two on each aircraft. The crash happened just outside the Manor grounds, close to the village of Upper Winchendon. The wreckage landed in dense woodland. Emergency services were called at 12:06 GMT. Seven fire vehicles, the Thames Valley air ambulance, two ambulances, and a rapid response vehicle attended.

The crash involved a Cessna 152 registration G-WACG, and a Guimbal Cabri G2 registration G-JAMM, each with two people on board. Both aircraft had come from Wycombe Air Park, from the crash site. The Cessna had previously been involved in an incident in 1993.

The pilot of the helicopter was Mike Green, an instructor who was training a student pilot at the time. The student pilot was later announced as being a captain in the Vietnamese Army, who was training to become a military flight instructor. The bodies of all four victims were removed from the site on 19 November.

Thames Valley Police stated that the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) had been informed. Military support was provided to assist with recovery of the wreckage of the two aircraft, which was dispatched to the AAIB&#x27;s headquarters at Farnborough Airport, Hampshire.

<text>Adnan Muzahim Ameen al-Pachachi () (14 May 1923 – 17 November 2019), better known as Adnan Pachachi, was an Iraqi politician and statesman who served as Iraq&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations (1959–1965 and 1967–1969) and foreign minister (1965–1967).

After 1971, he left Iraq in exile and became an Emirati Minister of State and political advisor to United Arab Emirates president Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. Following the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, Pachachi was an important figure in Iraqi politics, often described as Iraq&#x27;s elder statesman. He rejected the role of president in the Iraqi Interim Government.

==Childhood and education==
Pachachi was born in Baghdad on 14 May 1923. As the son of Muzahim al-Pachachi, nephew of Hamdi al-Pachachi and the cousin of Nadim al-Pachachi, he was the scion of a Sunni Arab nationalist family with a long tradition in Iraqi politics and a graduate from Victoria College, Alexandria in Egypt. He supported the 1941 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état led by Rashid Ali Al-Gaylani as a member of the Kata&#x27;ib al-Shabab (Youth Brigade).

Pachachi completed his undergraduate studies in 1943 at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon, majoring in political science. While attending the university, he was inspired by the early emergence of the Arab Nationalist Movement on the campus. After his return to Iraq, his application for a job in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was refused by the Iraqi Criminal Investigation Department due to his participation in the Kata&#x27;ib al-Shabab and support for the 1941 coup.

==Diplomatic and political career in Iraq==
Eventually, in 1950, he was appointed assistant director of the Political Department in the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs and continued to work in the Foreign Service over the next eight years. In 1958, the union of Egypt and Syria was led by Gamal Abdel Nasser and the United Arab Republic was founded. Pachachi had been a vocal supporter of Nasser, particularly during the Suez War in 1956 although official Iraqi government policy at the time was aligned with the British against him. On his attraction to the Egyptian leader he wrote in his memoir &quot;My feelings about Egypt and Jamal Abdul Nasser had deep-rooted origins. In the first place I shared my father&#x27;s belief that Egypt was the most important Arab country and that Iraq should at all times should have the best relations with her. My father, in and out of power, consistently called for the closest ties with Egypt. It cost him his political career in 1950. He remained very close to Abdul Nasser and supported him during the fateful days of the Suez War. Being a fervent Arab nationalist, I was naturally attracted by Nasser&#x27;s call for Arab unity, and during the Suez crisis I supported him without reservation. I admired Abdul Nasser because he personified more than anyone, the idea or Arab unity and seemed the only leader capable of achieving it.&quot; It was for this reason he was not trusted by Prime Minister Nuri as-Said and deemed to be a Nasserist. On 13 July 1958 he was dismissed and removed from the Iraqi Foreign Service due to his pro-Nasserite positions.

The very next day was the 14 July Revolution led by Abdul Karim Qassim. The Hashemite monarchy and Nuri as-Said were overthrown. Pachachi was promptly appointed Iraq&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations in 1959 by Qassim&#x27;s revolutionary regime. During this time Iraq formed a close relationship with the Soviet Union led by Nikita Khrushchev. Under Qassim, Iraq was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961 and Pachachi met with founding leaders Josep Broz Tito, Kwame Nkrumah, Jawaharlal Nehru, Fidel Castro, and Sukarno as a representative of his country. During his time at the United Nations he also met with well-known figures such as Patrice Lumumba and Malcolm X. The Qassim regime recognised the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Pachachi argued very strongly for their inclusion at the United Nations. Despite the brutal 1963 coup which removed Qassim from power in Iraq, Pachachi remained the representative at the United Nations.

Pachachi wrote extensively about his time at the UN in his memoir, &quot;Iraq&#x27;s Voice at the United Nations: 1959-1969&quot;. He expressed his dismay at the influence of the Zionist lobby over western media and speculated on the reasons for the support displayed for Israel. &quot;The press of many Western countries abound with news commentaries and photographs extolling Israel&#x27;s achievements and exploits, and scarcely hiding the perverse and malicious pleasure felt at the new tragedy that has befallen the people of Palestine. What can the meaning of all this be? Perhaps, in due course, some introspective and compassionate minds in the West might invest some time in soul-searching to analyse this curious phenomenon of Western, almost tribal, jubilation at Arab agony. Can it be that the temporary triumph of Zionist arms offers emotional compensation to some sections of the Western public for the post-Second World War retreat of Western colonialism before the advancing tide of Afro-Asian nationalism? Indeed, can we forget that Zionism is in fact chronologically the last wave of European demographic displacement at the expense of an Afro-Asian people?&quot;

Following the announcement of his departure from the United Nations in December 1965, Pachachi was presented with a plaque by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) &quot;in recognition and appreciation of his dedication to and distinguished services for Palestine in the United Nations.&quot; The PLO was considered by the United States and Israel to be a terrorist organization until the Madrid Conference in 1991 but has enjoyed observer status at the United Nations since 1974. Pachachi was then appointed Foreign Minister of Iraq in 1965 by President Abdul Salam Arif; he stated the belief that his appointment to this position was at the behest of Gamel Abdel Nasser. Pachachi served as the Foreign Minister of Iraq during the Six-Day War with Israel and on the eve of conflict at the 1345th meeting of the United Nations Security Council on 31 May 1967, he announced:

&quot;We shall defend ourselves whatever the cost and however long and difficult the struggle may be. We are prepared to use every tool at our disposal. The conflict will be total and uncompromising. The day before I left Baghdad, my government decided to deny our oil resources to any state which takes part in or supports the Israeli aggression against the Arab states. We have invited all other Arab oil-producing and exporting countries to meet with us and co-ordinate our positions. This must prove that our people are prepared to bear any hardship and accept any sacrifice. But there will be no retreat. Make no mistake about that; make no miscalculations. For fifty years we witnessed the Zionist peril steadily advancing. From a mere promise given by a colonial power in time of war, Israel was able to carve for itself a precious part of our homeland, continually threatening and trying to intimidate our people with murderous attacks across the armistice lines which the Arab countries have not crossed once since 1949 but which the Israelis have crossed with their armies twelve times. And now they are not hesitating to threaten to unleash war on us, and maybe on the world, in order to keep their ill gotten gains.&quot;

Following the outbreak of war with Israel on 5 June, Iraq severed diplomatic relations with the United States, suspended oil shipments, refused to permit U.S. aircraft to overfly Iraq, and announced a boycott of U.S. goods. Pachachi later denounced the ceasefire which ended the Six-Day War, dismissing it as a &quot;complete surrender to Israel.&quot; In his memoirs Pachachi described the Arab defeat in 1967 as &quot;a traumatic experience from which I never really recovered.&quot; He then served as Permanent Representative to the UN for a second time from 1967 to 1969. The Ba&#x27;ath Party came to power in July 1968, in a coup which Pachachi claimed was supported by the CIA, in an effort to distance Iraq from Gemal Abdel Nasser. Pachachi resigned from his post in January 1969 because as he put it &quot;I felt it was morally wrong to represent a regime whose values I don&#x27;t share.&quot; At the United Nations he was remembered for his rejections of Zionism and his refusal to recognise Kuwait. He then left Iraq in 1971.

==Exile and Diplomatic career in the UAE==
He went into in exile in Abu Dhabi, which had become independent. Sheik Zayed appointed Pachachi as Minister of State in the first Government of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi; he took up his office on 1 July 1971. When the United Arab Emirates was formed on 2 December 1971, Pachachi immediately flew to New York and submitted the UAE&#x27;s application for membership in the United Nations. Given his long career as Iraq&#x27;s foreign minister and UN ambassador, Pachachi had many colleagues and contacts at the UN. &quot;I saw that I had to convince two important permanent members of the Security Council, China and the Soviet Union, not to veto our application,&quot; he recalled.
&quot;At the time, there were close relations with the Communist Party in the south of Yemen, who opposed the creation of the UAE,&quot; he said. &quot;So I had long talks with them, and assured them that the UAE would not enter into any anti-Communist alliances, would not be bound by any treaty obligations, and would join the ranks of the non-aligned countries.&quot; In 1973, as a result of US military support for Israel in the October War the UAE imposed an oil embargo, a move followed by other Arab oil-producing countries, and Pachachi was selected as the spokesman to convey Sheikh Zayed&#x27;s message at the European Summit in Copenhagen. &quot;We told them the embargo was imposed because of the large-scale military assistance given to Israel by the US, and we demanded justice for the Palestinians and the settlement of the conflict on the basis of total withdrawal of Israeli forces from Arab territories occupied in the 1967 war,&quot; he said. Pachachi was granted UAE citizenship in 1974 and served on the board of directors for entities including Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc), the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (Adia), and the Abu Dhabi Fund for Economic Development. He was also a member of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council and chairman of the General Projects Committee.

He described himself as a fervent Arab nationalist. In his memoirs he wrote that he was unable to accept Israel&#x27;s existence and that Iraq and Syria should unite into one Arab state. During the Gulf war he wrote: &quot;Whatever the outcome of the Kuwait crisis, the Arabs must continue their efforts to build a credible military alternative. The
first imperative step toward reaching this goal is to achieve unity between Iraq and Syria. Without the unity of these two countries, the Arabs can
never successfully resist Israel&#x27;s armed might.&quot; Pachachi publicly opposed the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 and only renounced his nearly 40-year-old view that Kuwait was part of Iraq in 1999.

==Events of 2003–2004==
In February 2003 he reportedly described the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s foreign policy hawks as a &quot;Zionist lobby&quot;. Pachachi dismissed US plans to redraw the map of the Middle East to benefit Washington and set up an American military administration in Baghdad. &quot;These statements come from the Zionist lobby in the United States which thinks that overthrowing Saddam Hussein will bring Arab reconciliation with Israel. That is stupid because if a democratic regime is created in Iraq, it will display greater hatred for Israel. This lobby is opposed to me playing any role in Iraq, through the instigation of Ahmad Chalabi,&quot; Pachachi said. Unlike Chalabi, who had sought the support of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Pachachi said there would not be any relations between Iraq and Israel, as this would be antithetical to Iraqi interests.

On 15 February 2003, David Frum, a speechwriter for US President George W. Bush, who authored his “axis of evil” speech, described Pachachi as &quot;an old-fashioned pan-Arabist.” Frum stated “Mr. Pachachi is more than 80 years old and in many ways a very disturbing figure – for three decades he advocated the annexation of Kuwait to Iraq.&quot; On 24 February 2003, Jed Babbin the United States Deputy Undersecretary of Defense described Pachachi as &quot;an octogenarian Arab-nationalist hostile to the U.S.&quot; going on to state that &quot;For 30 years, Pachachi insisted that Kuwait was part of Iraq, and not entitled to independence. Now, he refers to Bush administration hawks as a &#x27;Zionist lobby&#x27;. Offering Pachachi a part in the new Iraq makes as much sense as inviting in one of the Iranian mullahs.&quot;

Pachachi had strongly opposed the invasion and occupation of Iraq and was involved in creating an exile deal that the UAE offered Saddam Hussein in a last minute effort to avoid the impending war and suffering of the Iraqi people. Saddam allegedly accepted the offer to try to halt the invasion and bring elections to Iraq within six months, according to Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan; however, the invasion still went ahead. In February 2003, Pachachi refused a seat on the US-appointed six-member leadership council set up at a meeting of major opposition groups in the Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq.

Pachachi vocally opposed the process of awarding out contracts to US firms after the ousting of the Ba&#x27;ath regime and criticised Washington over the plans for a US-led civilian authority to hand out reconstruction contracts without the approval of an elected Iraqi government. In April 2003, the US government awarded the Bechtel Corporation a $680-million-contract to help rebuild Iraq&#x27;s power, water and sewage systems as well as repair air and sea ports, Pachachi slammed this decision saying &quot;No one has the right to commit Iraq to obligations and costs, only an Iraqi government can do that. A parliament should also endorse the agreements.&quot;

After much deliberation Pachachi agreed to be part of the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) in July 2003 at the age of 80. The &quot;CounterPunch&quot; journalist Andrew Cockburn commented on the IGC: &quot;I think one person who deserves credit is Adnan Pachachi. From the beginning when they moved into Baghdad and seized nice houses, he was the only one that insisted on paying rent. He has always exhibited integrity.&quot; Following the establishment of the Governing Council, Joel Mowbray wrote in the &quot;National Review&quot; &quot;Pachachi is one of a number of people with uncomfortably tight ties to terrorism. When he was the foreign minister of Iraq in the 1960s, Pachachi was very close to the first generation of Palestinian terrorists. And after the Baath Party had come to power, Pachachi refused to condemn the hanging of Jews in Baghdad in 1969.&quot; Pachachi was also denounced by a Middle East specialist at the CIA, Reuel Marc Gerecht, as &quot;a surreal specimen of Pan-Arabism from 30 years ago.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; journalist Judith Miller dismissed the inclusion of Pachachi in the Iraqi Governing Council as a &quot;diplomatic flap&quot;, claiming that his involvement in the political process &quot;at this late stage would backfire politically and could alienate Kuwait, an essential base of operations in any gulf war.&quot; Danielle Pletka, vice-president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), also denounced the inclusion of Pachachi in the IGC as &quot;very disappointing&quot;.

Pachachi accused the US military of war crimes during the First Battle of Fallujah which was codenamed Operation Vigilant Resolve. In April 2004, during the US military operations in the city, he spoke out angrily claiming the actions taken by US forces were &quot;illegal and totally unacceptable&quot; he also accused them of &quot;inflicting collective punishment on the residents of Fallujah&quot; which is a war crime under the Fourth Geneva Convention. On 14 May, Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute made clear his preference for Chalabi over Pachachi, writing &quot;Chalabi may be a controversial figure and a lightning rod for criticism, but unlike figures like Muqtada al-Sadr and Abdul Aziz Hakim, Chalabi has always voiced his dissent peacefully. Unlike Adnan Pachachi, he has never called for the elimination of a neighboring Arab state or condemned the United States.&quot;

On 29 May 2004, Pachachi said, referring to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, &quot;The Americans thought they were marching into an underdeveloped country, expecting to face little resistance and be welcomed with flowers. The Americans quickly realized that the Iraqi is a patriot, one who defends his country, just as his ancestors have done for thousands of years. We are an educated people with a long history, and we are a cultured people. The Americans also did not expect the infrastructure they found in Iraq. They were surprised. They couldn&#x27;t understand that a dictator like Saddam Hussein had invested a large share of oil revenues in infrastructure projects, such as highways, modern irrigation canals and industrial plants, which one doesn&#x27;t find in just any country. The marines were confused by this new realization, as well as by their failure to achieve a swift victory and by the ongoing resistance. It also confounded the American concept, that is, if a sound and credible concept ever existed. No people in the world wishes to live with occupiers, and we Iraqis are no different.&quot; Pachachi also commented on the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse &quot;What kind of reaction do you expect from the Iraqis? Regardless of age, profession and political affiliation, we are all horrified and furious about these atrocities. I had already heard about the brusque approach taken by the Americans during house searches early on. However, I was completely taken aback by the gruesome scope of the torture and human rights violations that have now come to light. Not just I, but all Iraqis demand a tough investigation and punishment of the perpetrators and the people behind them. We also need guarantees that such atrocities will cease once and for all. What has happened cannot be undone, and the long-term psychological consequences are unforeseeable.&quot;

On 1 June 2004, he was reportedly nominated to be the President of the Iraqi Interim Government by UN Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi. He chose to decline the post publicly, stating that he turned down the position &quot;because I was accused of being the choice of the Americans. I had to refuse this offer, in order to preserve my reputation and my honor. Trying to portray me as a little soft on the Americans when I have been struggling for Arab rights all my life is not only false, it is unfair. I find it really insulting.&quot; Pachachi later claimed he was forced to turn down the job because of a &quot;shabby conspiracy&quot; led by Chalabi. He said &quot;There is a great deal of disinformation that I was the preferred candidate of the US. Nothing could be further from the truth.&quot; Paul Bremer in his memoirs indicated that Presidentr Bush himself urged the appointment of Ghazi al-Yawar as President of the Iraqi Interim Government, as Bush &quot;had been favorably impressed by Ghazi&#x27;s open thanks to the Coalition for overthrowing Saddam and by his determination to continue the process to sovereignty and eventual democracy.&quot; Brahimi promptly announced his resignation as UN Envoy, resulting from &quot;great difficulties and frustration experienced during his assignment in Iraq.&quot; He expressed serious disappointment and frustration about his role stating &quot;Bremer is the dictator of Iraq, He has the money. He has the signature. I will not say who was my first choice, and who was not my first choice. I will remind you that the Americans are governing this country.&quot;

===Political activity after 2005===
Pachachi put together a list of candidates called the Assembly of Independent Democrats (his party Democratic Centrist Tendency was included) to contest Iraq&#x27;s January 2005 legislative election. Prior to the elections, Pachachi accused the United States of interfering in Iraq&#x27;s affairs by insisting that the 30 January election go ahead on that date. Sunni Arab political and religious leaders, including Pachachi, called for a six-month delay arguing that the violence sweeping the country meant a free poll could not go ahead. &quot;The strange thing is that America and Iran, who differ on everything, agree on one issue of holding elections on January 30,&quot; Pachachi told reporters. &quot;It is not the business of the United States or Iran or any other country to talk about delaying or sticking to the date. We are very upset by such attempts as foreign states sharing their opinion in this issue. Let us try to agree among ourselves because external attempts might deter any agreement.&quot;

In May 2005 he commented &quot;The current situation in this country is very serious, the security is terrible, the services are almost non-existent the provision of the essentials is extremely inadequate. There is rampant corruption and selfishness the Iraqi political class is only a bit better than that of the Congo.&quot;

For the December 2005 elections, he was elected as a member of the list headed by former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. Following Arab political tradition, Pachachi opened the first session of the Iraqi National Assembly in April 2005, as the oldest member elected.

At the time of the March 2010 parliamentary election, Pachachi again stood as a candidate on Allawi&#x27;s Iraqi List. He expressed serious concerns about the credibility of the election: &quot;There have been wide reports of intimidation of voters; there are certain to be attempts at voter fraud.&quot; Pachachi suggested that the government could be planning fraud due to its alleged printing of seven million unnecessary ballots. Nevertheless, he was hopeful, arguing that voters were more interested in the candidates&#x27; ability than in sectarian concerns and that &quot;if they are allowed to [vote] without intimidation or fear, this could be a watershed moment and an example to the rest of the Middle East.&quot; However, after the elections in August 2010, he said &quot;The idea that Iraq is being left in a good position is utter nonsense,&quot; and American officials should not &quot;delude themselves.&quot; Later in August 2010, he was interviewed on the Al Jazeera programme &quot;Without Borders&quot;. When asked if he was satisfied with the performance of Paul Bremer as civilian administrator in Iraq, Pachachi replied &quot;No, Bremer was receiving his instructions from the Pentagon and as I told you the Pentagon is controlled by a group of Zionist extremists.&quot; In August 2011 he said &quot;The biggest beneficiaries of the deteriorating conditions of the Iraqi army and the elimination of Iraq&#x27;s military power are Iran and Israel. As it stands there is no opposition to Iranian influence nor a deterrent to Israel&#x27;s policy in the region.&quot; In December 2012, Pachachi told &quot;Al Arabiya&quot; that &quot;Iraq is a failed state and in need of a revolution&quot; further lamenting “Sorrow fills my heart that the Arab Spring has skipped Iraq. The wind of change that toppled regimes and rulers didn’t reach the country.&quot; He went on to blame the US invasion for the current state of the country and rampant sectarianism within it, stating &quot;The Americans allowed a sectarian-based political system due to their beliefs that Iraqis are divided by their sectarian and ethnic background and that the political assembly must represent this truth. What the Americans did not understand was that Iraq long witnessed intermarriage between Sunnis and Shiites.&quot; As someone who has witnessed so much, and was involved in some of the most intense negotiations and treaties, he says one of his regrets is not seeing a different union succeed. &quot;It is such a shame that Iraq and Syria did not unite, becoming the powerful heart of the Middle East. Instead, these two great nations, with such a great civilisation and such great hopes, became the heartache of the region,&quot; he says.

==Awards==
Pachachi was awarded with Abu Dhabi Awards, Emirate of Abu Dhabi&#x27;s highest civilian award, by Mohammad Bin Zayed Al Nahyan in 2016 for his services.

==Death==
Pachachi died on 17 November 2019 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

<text>Walters Ash (also sometimes called Walter&#x27;s Ash) is a village in the parish of Bradenham, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located in the Chiltern Hills, to the west of the main village, adjacent to Naphill. Between 1983 and 1985 there was a peace camp outside RAF High Wycombe station. This was to protest about the RAF bunker on National Trust land designated a place of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. There is also a water reservoir which was constructed at the same time. In February 2014 a sink hole opened under the drive of a bungalow and a car disappeared down it. The village is west of London and north west of High Wycombe.

<text>The Post (formerly The Dominion Post, lit. &#x27;Head of the Fish&#x27;) is a metropolitan daily newspaper published in Wellington, New Zealand. It is owned by media business Stuff Ltd, and formerly by the New Zealand branch of Australian media company Fairfax Media. Weekday issues are now in tabloid format, and its Saturday edition is in broadsheet format.

&quot;The Dominion Post&quot; was created in July 2002 with the merger of two metropolitan broadsheet newspapers, &quot;The Evening Post&quot; and &quot;The Dominion&quot;. It was announced in April 2023 that the paper would be renamed The Post. The change of name has garnered a generally unenthusiastic to negative response. Since July 2023, the editor has been Tracy Watkins.

== History ==
===&quot;The Dominion Post&quot;, 2002–2023===
&quot;The Dominion Post&quot; (commonly referred to as &quot;The DomPost&quot;) was created in July 2002 when Independent Newspapers Limited (INL) amalgamated two Wellington printed and published metropolitan broadsheet newspapers, &quot;The Evening Post&quot;, an evening paper first published on 8 February 1865, and &quot;The Dominion&quot;, a morning paper first published on Dominion Day, 26 September 1907.

&quot;The Dominion&quot; was distributed throughout the lower half of the North Island, as far as Taupo, where it met with Auckland&#x27;s ambitiously named &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;. &quot;The Evening Post&quot; was not so widely distributed, but had a much greater circulation than &quot;The Dominion&quot;. After the titles were merged&quot;, The Dominion Post&quot; was the only daily newspaper in Wellington City. It was printed in Petone, Lower Hutt.

INL sold &quot;The Dominion Post&quot; and all other New Zealand newspapers and most magazines in its catalogue to Fairfax Media in 2003. On 1 February 2018, Fairfax New Zealand Limited changed its name to Stuff Limited (named after its Stuff website, which launched in 2000). In December 2018, Fairfax Media merged with Australia&#x27;s Nine Entertainment, which acquired its stable of New Zealand newspapers. 

On 25 May 2020, Nine Entertainment sold its holdings, including &quot;The Dominion Post,&quot; to Stuff&#x27;s CEO Sinead Boucher for NZ$1, with the transaction completed on 31 May 2024. This marked the return of the company to New Zealand ownership.

===&quot;The Post&quot;, 2023–present===
On 14 April 2023, it was announced that the paper would change its name by dropping &quot;Dominion&quot; from the title. The editor, Caitlin Cherry, laid out the rationale: As an independently owned New Zealand company, we are under no-one’s dominion. New Zealand’s status as a dominion ended in 1945 when we joined the United Nations. It’s time for the word to go.

On 27 April 2023, Stuff confirmed that &quot;The Dominion Post&quot; would adopt its new name &quot;The Post&quot; on 29 April. Stuff also announced that it would launch a new subscription-based website for &quot;The Post&quot; that would co-exist with the free Stuff news website. 

The change of name was criticised on both the political left and right. Former &quot;Dominion Post&quot; editor Tim Pankhurst was skeptical, saying it was &quot;short-sighted&quot;, given that market research conducted in 2002 indicated that the &quot;Dominion Post&quot; masthead had better name recognition within Wellington than Coca-Cola&#x27;s logo. Colin Peacock from RNZ Mediawatch dismissed the name change as &quot;bit of branding&quot; and expected &quot;a bit of blowback&quot; from older readers.

The dropping of &quot;Dominion&quot;, a word described by legal expert Grant Morris as &quot;not actually that important&quot;, was perceived by some as virtue signaling. Morris also pointed out that no Act of Parliament has actually revoked New Zealand&#x27;s status as a Dominion, which it held from 1907 until the Statute of Westminster was adopted in 1947.

The name change was also thought by some to be hypocritical for suggesting an anti-imperialist stance, given the newspaper&#x27;s historical bias against Māori, for which Stuff apologised in 2020. The name &quot;The Post&quot; was considered bland and unoriginal by many, with Newstalk ZB describing it as &quot;an act reflective of a complete lack of any creativity&quot;.

==Editors==
Richard Long had been the editor of &quot;The Dominion&quot; for ten years and was appointed the inaugural editor for &quot;The Dominion Post&quot;, but resigned shortly after the newspaper merger. Tim Pankhurst joined &quot;The Dominion Post&quot; shortly after it was founded to take over from Long. He resigned in February 2009 to head the New Zealand Press Association. Bernadette Courtney, who had previously been assistant editor at &quot;The Dominion Post&quot; and had gone to become editor of the &quot;Manawatu Standard&quot;, was appointed to replace Pankhurst. Courtney started in a national role for Stuff in 2018 and was replaced by Eric Janssen.

Anna Fifield was appointed editor October 2020. She left in December 2022. Caitlin Cherry took over in February 2023, and Tracy Watkins in July 2023.

The historic hamlet is located about four miles south of Central Milton Keynes and just east of Simpson, mostly along Walton Road in the modern Walnut Tree district. The modern H9 Groveway grid road severs a few of its houses into Walton Hall and the V10 Brickhill Street separates the Manor Farm off into the Walton grid square. The Manor Farm has been redeveloped, first into a research centre for Hoechst and subsequently as the UK headquarters of MSD Animal Health.

The village name is a common one in England, and is an Old English language word, meaning either &#x27;village of the Britons&#x27; (&quot;wale&quot; being a word meaning Briton) or &#x27;walled village&#x27;. The village is first recorded (in the 12th century) as &quot;Wauton&quot;.

Walton Hall, the manor house of the village, and its chapel of ease (now ) are in the campus grounds of The Open University, in the Walton Hall district.

==Modern Walton==
The modern Walton district is a light-industrial and residential district on the banks of the River Ouzel, a tributary of the Great Ouse and on the other side of Brickhill Street from the hamlet that gives it its name. It is largely the grounds of Walton Manor Farm. The other village farm, Walnut Tree Farm, still exists and the Walnut Tree district is on its lands.

==Walton Civil Parish==
The civil parish of Walton includes the districts of Browns Wood, Caldecotte, Old Farm Park, Tilbrook, Towergate, Walton, Walton Hall, Walton Park, Walnut Tree and Wavendon Gate. Caldecotte Lake is one of the more significant geographic features, extending from Caldecotte and Walton Park. The Parish Council is entitled a &#x27;Community Council&quot;.

Walton Community Council is the first tier of local government serving those living, attending and working in this area of Milton Keynes. The Community Council is responsible for the estates and villages of Browns Wood, Caldecotte, Old Farm Park, Tilbrook, Tower Gate, Walnut Tree, Walton Hall, Walton Park and Wavendon Gate.

===Browns Wood===
Browns Wood is a district in the south-east corner of the civil parish which, in the 2001 Census, also gave its name to an Office for National Statistics designated &#x27;urban sub-area&#x27;.

The Sports Ground at Browns Wood contains 2 football pitches, a pump track, children&#x27;s play area, outdoor gym and a Multi Use Games Area (MUGA) which is open access but can be hired from the Walton Community Council.

===Caldecotte===

Caldecotte (pronounced ) is another district in the parish, that includes the site of an ancient village of the same name. It is also includes the larger part of Caldecotte Lake, an important manmade balancing lake that manages flood water on the River Ouzel just as it enters Milton Keynes. The lake is used by a number of local clubs for rowing and other water sports.

The place name is fairly common in England, and is Old English meaning &quot;cold cottage&quot;. This refers to a resting place for travellers or other strangers on the road. The original Northampton to London road (modern Brickhill Street) runs nearby, just short of its junction with Watling Street (itself a major route in continuous use since Roman times). The village declined when the Northampton road was rerouted in 1728 through Broughton and Woburn to join the Watling Street at Hockliffe.
===Old Farm Park===
Old Farm Park is a residential area in the south-east of the parish.

===Tilbrook===

The industrial area of Tilbrook is noted for being the home of Red Bull Racing.

===Walton (district)===
Walton itself is to the north-west of the parish, contained by Groveway, Brickhill Street, Bletcham Way and the River Ouzel. Walton contains a research centre for Hoechst AG as well as housing.

===Walton Hall===

Walton Hall is in the northwest of the parish, and is the location of the campus and offices of The Open University. The university campus covers 

In the university campus grounds are the manor house (Walton Hall), which gives the district its name, and the ancient chapel of ease of St Michael, now . The manor farm-lands are divided between Walton Hall, the modern Walton, Kents Hill and Walnut Tree.

The manor house itself, built in 1830 in the Regency style for the Pinfold family, is home to the vice-chancellor&#x27;s offices of the Open University.

Walton Hall is on the banks of the Ouzel, a tributary of the Great Ouse where Walton Lake, a small balancing lake, has become naturalised and is home to reeds, bulrushes, reed warbler, reed bunting, water rail, sparrowhawk, kestrel, green woodpecker, grass snake and many varieties of odonata. Surrounding the reedbed are ponds and open water, ancient hedgerows and hay meadow.

===Walnut Tree===

Walnut Tree is a residential district in Walton, with a population of 3,354 in the last UK census. It is named after the Walnut Tree Farm, on whose land the estate was built. All the street names in Walnut Tree are named after either wild flowers and herbs or 18th century turnpike trusts.

Walnut Tree is home to a local centre, including small shopping outlets and takeaway restaurants. The district also contains a GP surgery, a sports injury clinic, a pub and a pet supplies store.

The area features three schools, all operated by the Milton Keynes Education Trust (MKET) – Walton High for secondary education as well as the Heronshaw and Heronsgate schools for primary education, serving both Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 respectively.

There is a cricket ground and football pitch with changing facilities. There are a number of play parks for children scattered throughout the area.

===Wavendon Gate===
Wavendon Gate is a district within the civil parish which borders the village of Wavendon. It is a mainly residential area which contains the Wavendon Gate junior school and also a cricket green and pavilion for recreational activities.

==ONS Urban Sub-Areas==

For the 2001 Census, the Office for National Statistics designated urban sub-areas called Walnut Tree and Browns Wood that are far bigger than the districts of that name. The Walnut Tree and Browns Wood urban sub-areas together approximated to that part of the former Newport Pagnell Rural District that is west of the River Ouzel and east of the M1. The ONS discontinued this usage in the 2011 Census.

<doc id="419563" wikidata="Q182914" url="?curid=419563" title="Hasan ibn Ali">
<text>Hasan ibn Ali (; 2 April 670) was an Alid political and religious leader. The eldest son of Ali and Fatima and a grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, Hasan briefly ruled as Rashidun caliph from January 661 until August 661. He is considered as the second Imam in Shia Islam, succeeding Ali and preceding his brother Husayn. As a grandson of the prophet, he is part of the and the , and also participated in the event of the mubahala.

During the caliphate of Ali (), Hasan accompanied him in the military campaigns of the First Fitna. Following Ali&#x27;s assassination in January 661, Hasan was acknowledged caliph in Kufa. His sovereignty was not recognized by Mu&#x27;awiya I (), the governor of Syria, who led an army into Kufa while pressing Hasan for abdication in letters. In response, Hasan sent a vanguard under Ubayd Allah ibn al-Abbas to block Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s advance until he arrived with the main army. Meanwhile, Hasan was severely wounded in an abortive assassination attempt by the Kharijites, a faction opposed to both Ali and Mu&#x27;awiya. This attack demoralized Hasan&#x27;s army and led to widespread desertion. Ubayd Allah and most of his troops also defected after Mu&#x27;awiya bribed him. In August 661, Hasan signed a peace treaty with Mu&#x27;awiya on the condition that the latter should rule in compliance with the Quran and the , a council should appoint his successor, and Hasan&#x27;s supporters would receive amnesty. Hasan retired from politics and abdicated in Medina where he died either from illness or poisoning, though the early sources are nearly unanimous that he was poisoned. Mu&#x27;awiya is commonly viewed as the instigator in the murder of Hasan, which removed an obstacle to the succession of his son Yazid I ().

Critics of Hasan call his treaty with Mu&#x27;awiya an indication of weakness, saying that he intended to surrender from the beginning. Given Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s military superiority, supporters of Hasan maintain that his abdication was inevitable after his soldiers mutinied and that he was motivated by the desire for unity and peace among Muslims, which was reportedly predicted by Muhammad in a Sunni hadith. Another Sunni hadith, also attributed to Muhammad, predicted that the prophetic succession would last for thirty years, which may have been interpreted by some early Sunni scholars as evidence that Hasan&#x27;s caliphate was rightly-guided (). In Shia theology, the divine infallibility () of Hasan as the second Shia Imam further justified his course of action. As the rightful successor of Muhammad in Shia Islam, Hasan&#x27;s all-inclusive temporal and religious authority came from divinely-inspired designation (), which was not annulled by abdication to Mu&#x27;awiya, who usurped only the temporal authority. The imamate and caliphate are viewed as separate institutions in Shia Islam until such time that God would make the Imam victorious.

==Early life==
=== Birth ===
Hasan was born in Medina in . Sources differ on whether he was born in the Islamic months of Sha&#x27;ban or Ramadan, though most early works give his birthdate as 15 Ramadan 3 AH (2 March 625 CE), which is annually celebrated by the Shia. Hasan was the firstborn of Muhammad&#x27;s daughter Fatima and his cousin Ali. Their union holds a special spiritual significance for Muslims, write Nasr and Afsaruddin, and Muhammad said he followed divine orders to marry Fatima to Ali, narrates the Sunni al-Suyuti (), among others. Ali reportedly had chosen another name in Sunni sources but deferred to Muhammad who named the child Hasan (). To celebrate his birth, Muhammad sacrificed a ram, while Fatima shaved Hasan&#x27;s head and donated the weight of his hair in silver.

=== Lifetime of Muhammad ===
Hasan was raised in Muhammad&#x27;s household until the age of seven when his grandfather died. Early sources widely report Muhammad&#x27;s love for Hasan and his brother Husayn, saying that Muhammad allowed the boys to climb on his back while he was prostrate in prayer, and interrupted a sermon to pick Hasan up after his grandson fell. On one occasion, Hasan later recalled, his grandfather took away a date from him and explained that receiving alms () was forbidden for his family.

A hadith () in the canonical Sunni collection &quot;Sunan ibn Majah&quot; names Hasan and Husayn as the s () of the youth in the paradise. Madelung adds that this hadith is widely reported, while Veccia Vaglieri () notes that its authenticity was disputed by the Umayyad Marwan (). The same source and the canonical Shia source &quot;Kitab al-Irshad&quot; narrate the prophetic hadith, &quot;He who has loved Hasan and Husayn has loved me and he who has hated them has hated me.&quot; Similarly, the canonical Sunni source &quot;Sahih al-Tirmidhi&quot; ascribes to Muhammad, &quot;Whoever loves me and loves these two [Hasan and Husayn] and loves their mother and father [Fatima and Ali], will be with me in my station on the Day of Resurrection.&quot;

==== Mubahala ====
After an inconclusive debate in 10/631-2, Muhammad and the Najranite Christians decided to engage in , where both parties would pray to invoke God&#x27;s curse upon the liar. Madelung argues that Muhammad participated in this event alongside Hasan, Husayn, and their parents. This is also the Shia view. In contrast, most Sunni accounts by al-Tabari () do not name the participants of the event, while some other Sunni historians agree with the Shia view.

During the event, Muhammad gathered Hasan, Husayn, Ali, and Fatima under his cloak and addressed them as his , according to some Shia and Sunni sources, including the canonical &quot;Sahih Muslim&quot; and &quot;Sahih al-Tirmidhi&quot;. Madelung suggests that their inclusion by Muhammad in this significant ritual must have raised the religious rank of his family. A similar view is voiced by Lalani.

=== Death of Muhammad and Fatima (632) ===
Muhammad died in 11/632 when Hasan was about seven. As his family prepared for the burial, a group of Muslims gathered at the Saqifa and appointed Abu Bakr as Muhammad&#x27;s successor, in the absence of his family and the majority of the Muhajirun (Meccan Muslims). Ali, Fatima, and some supporters did not recognize the caliphate of Abu Bakr, saying that Muhammad had appointed Ali as his successor, possibly referring to the Ghadir Khumm in 632.

Fatima died also in 632, within six months of Muhammad&#x27;s death, at the age of about eighteen or twenty-seven years old. Shias hold that she miscarried her child and died from the injuries she suffered in an attack on her house, intended to subdue Ali, at the order of Abu Bakr. These allegations are rejected by Sunnis, who believe that Fatima died from grief after Muhammad&#x27;s death and that her child died in infancy of natural causes.

==Rashidun caliphate==
=== Caliphates of Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman ===
Hasan did not play a major role under the first three caliphs, namely, Abu Bakr (), Umar (), and Uthman (). He might have had a share of five thousand dirhams in Umar&#x27;s system of state pension. According to Ibn Isfandiyar, Hasan also took part in an expedition to Amol during the caliphate of Umar, though the veracity of such reports have been questioned by Paktchi et al.

Defying Uthman, Hasan joined his father in bidding farewell to Abu Dharr al-Ghifari (), who was exiled from Medina after he preached against the misdeeds of the powerful. When Uthman&#x27;s half-brother al-Walid ibn Uqba was accused of drinking alcohol, Ali asked Hasan to carry out the punishment of forty lashes, though the latter reportedly refused and Abdullah ibn Ja&#x27;far instead administered the penalty. Veccia Vaglieri does not mention any disagreements and writes that Ali meted out the punishment himself. She also suggests that the young Hasan and his brother Husayn lived in a state of obedience to their father Ali, following Ali whenever he opposed Uthman.

In June 656, Uthman was besieged in his home by rebels. Hasan and Husayn were likely wounded while guarding Uthman&#x27;s house at the request of Ali. In particular, the reports that Hasan was among the defenders are considered numerous and reliable by Madelung. On the final day, however, Hasan and most of the guards are said to have laid down their weapons at Uthman&#x27;s request. Yet another report states that Hasan arrived at the scene of Uthman&#x27;s murder in time to identify his assassins. According to Madelung, Hasan later criticized Ali for not doing enough to defend Uthman.

===Caliphate of Ali===
Ali was elected caliph after the assassination of Uthman. Immediately after his accession, the new caliph faced a rebellion led by Aisha, a widow of Muhammad and daughter of Abu Bakr, and Talha and Zubayr, two companions of Muhammad. Hasan and Ammar ibn Yasir () were subsequently sent to Kufa to rally support and raised an army of some 6,000 men. He also helped remove Abu Musa al-Ash&#x27;ari from the rule of Kufa, as the latter continued to hinder Ali&#x27;s efforts against the rebels. Hasan later fought in the Battle of the Camel (656) against Aisha, Talha, and Zubayr.

Hasan also fought against Mu&#x27;awiya () in the Battle of Siffin (657), though (Sunni) sources do not view him as a prominent participant. Madelung writes that Hasan criticized Ali&#x27;s alleged aggressive war policy, saying that it stoked division among Muslims. In contrast, the Sunni Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Barr () lists Hasan as a commander at Siffin and the Shia Nasr ibn Muzahim () narrates that Mu&#x27;awiya offered Hasan to switch sides at Siffin but was rejected. Haj-Manouchehri writes that Hasan persuaded some neutral figures to support Ali at Siffin, including Sulayman ibn Surad al-Khuza&#x27;i. He adds that Hasan vigorously opposed the arbitration process after Siffin, alongside his father. In November 658, Ali placed Hasan in charge of his land endowments.

==Caliphate of Hasan==
In January 661, Ali was assassinated by the Kharijite Abd al-Rahman ibn Muljam. Hasan was subsequently acknowledged caliph in Kufa, the seat of Ali&#x27;s caliphate. Madelung writes that Ali had apparently not nominated a successor before his sudden death but had often said that only members of Muhammad&#x27;s household () were entitled to the caliphate. As Ali&#x27;s legatee, Hasan must have been the obvious choice for the caliphate. Some Shia reports add that Ali also designated Hasan as his , thus giving him his own authority to command, and also his , responsible for punishing his assassin. Some authors have noted that Muhammad&#x27;s surviving companions were primarily in Ali&#x27;s army and must have therefore pledged allegiance to Hasan, as evidenced by the lack of any reports to the contrary.

In his inaugural speech at the Great Mosque of Kufa, Hasan praised the and quoted verse 42:23 of the Quran:

Ali&#x27;s commander Qays ibn Sa&#x27;d was the first to pledge his allegiance to Hasan. Qays offered his oath based on the Quran, precedent (), and jihad against those who declared lawful () what was unlawful (). Hasan, however, avoided the last condition by saying that it was implicit in the first two. About this episode, Jafri () suggests that Hasan was probably already apprehensive about the Kufans&#x27; support and wanted to avoid unrealistic commitments. The oath stipulated that people &quot;should make war on those who were at war with Hasan, and should live in peace with those who were at peace with him,&quot; writes the Sunni al-Baladhuri (), adding that this condition astonished the people, who suspected that he intended to make peace with Mu&#x27;awiya. In contrast, Madelung notes that the oath was identical to the one demanded earlier by Ali and denounced by the Kharijites. The view of Dakake is similar.

===Conflict with Mu&#x27;awiya===

Having been at war with Ali, Mu&#x27;awiya did not recognize the caliphate of his successor and prepared for war. He marched an army of sixty thousand men through al-Jazira to Maskin, about north of the present-day Baghdad. Concurrently, Mu&#x27;awiya also corresponded with Hasan, urging him to give up his claim to the caliphate. Jafri suggests that he might have hoped to force Hasan to abdicate or attack the Iraqi forces before they were fortified. Mu&#x27;awiya might have believed that Hasan would remain a threat even if he was defeated and killed, since another Hashemite could continue the fight. If Hasan abdicated in favor of Mu&#x27;awiya, he writes, such claims would have no weight. The view of Momen is similar.

Their letters revisit the succession of Muhammad. Hasan urged Mu&#x27;awiya to pledge allegiance to him with the same arguments advanced by Ali against Abu Bakr after Muhammad&#x27;s death. Ali had said that if the Quraysh could successfully claim the leadership because Muhammad belonged to them, then Muhammad&#x27;s family was the most qualified to lead. Mu&#x27;awiya replied that Muslims were not unaware of the merits of the but had selected Abu Bakr to keep the caliphate within the Quraysh. Hassan also wrote that Mu&#x27;awiya had no true merit in Islam and was the son of Muhammad&#x27;s arch-enemy Abu Sufyan. Mu&#x27;awiya replied that he was better suited for the caliphate because of his age, governing experience, and superior military strength, thus implying that these qualities were more important than religious precedence. Jafri comments that Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s response made explicit the separation of politics and religion, which later became a tenet of Sunni Islam. In contrast, Shia Islam vested all authority in the household of Muhammad.
====Mobilization of Iraqi troops====
As the news of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s advance reached Hasan, he ordered his local governors to mobilize and invited the Kufans to prepare for war, &quot;God had prescribed the jihad for his creation and called it a loathsome duty (),&quot; referring to verse 2:216 of the Quran. There was no response at first, possibly because some tribal chiefs were bribed by Mu&#x27;awiya. Hasan&#x27;s companions now scolded the crowd and inspired them to leave in large numbers for the army campgrounds in Nukhayla. Hasan soon joined them and appointed Ubayd Allah ibn Abbas as the commander of a vanguard of twelve thousand men tasked with holding Mu&#x27;awiya back in Maskin until the arrival of Hasan&#x27;s main army. Ubayd Allah was advised not to fight unless attacked and to consult with Qays ibn Sa&#x27;d, the second in command. Wellhausen () names Abd Allah ibn Abbas as the commander of the vanguard, but this is rejected by Madelung, who suggests that the choice of Ubayd Allah indicates Hasan&#x27;s peace intentions because the former had earlier surrendered Yemen to Mu&#x27;awiya without a fight. This is the view of al-Zuhri (), the Umayyad-era historian who adopted the pro-Umayyad account that depicts a greedy Hasan eager to renounce his caliphate for money. This must have been the official Umayyad account, distributed to legitimize Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s rule in the absence of a council () or election or designation (), suggests Jafri.

==== Mutiny ====
While the vanguard was awaiting his arrival in Maskin, Hasan faced a mutiny at his military camp near al-Mada&#x27;in. Among the five surviving accounts, Jafri prefers the one by Abu Hanifa Dinawari (), which states that Hasan was concerned about his troops&#x27; resolve by the time he reached the outskirts of al-Mada&#x27;in. He thus halted the army at Sabat and told them in a speech that he preferred peace over war because his men were reluctant to fight. According to al-Mada&#x27;ini (), Hasan also quoted Ali as saying, &quot;Do not loathe the reign of Mu&#x27;awiya,&quot; which Madelung finds incredible.

Taking the speech as a sign that Hasan intended to pursue peace, Kharijite sympathizers in Hasan&#x27;s army looted his tent and pulled his prayer rug from under him. Alternatively, Jafri and al-Ya&#x27;qubi () hold Mu&#x27;awiya responsible for the mutiny through his network of spies, about which letters were earlier exchanged between Mu&#x27;awiya and Hasan and Ubayd Allah. As he was being escorted away to safety, the Kharijite al-Jarrah ibn Sinan attacked and wounded Hasan while shouting, &quot;You have become an infidel () like your father.&quot; Al-Jarrah was overpowered and killed, while Hasan, bleeding profusely, was taken for treatment to the house of Sa&#x27;d ibn Mas&#x27;ud al-Thaqafi, the governor of al-Mada&#x27;in. The news of this attack further demoralized Hasan&#x27;s army and led to widespread desertions. Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s nephew Mukhtar ibn Abi Ubayd () reportedly recommended the governor to surrender Hasan to Mu&#x27;awiya but was rejected.

====Desertions====
The Kufan vanguard arrived in Maskin and found Mu&#x27;awiya camped there. Through a representative, he urged them not to commence hostilities until he concluded his peace talks with Hasan. This was likely a false claim. The Kufans, however, insulted Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s envoy and sent him back. Mu&#x27;awiya then sent the envoy to visit Ubayd Allah privately, telling him that Hasan had requested a truce and then offering Ubayd Allah a million dirhams to switch sides. Ubayd Allah accepted and deserted at night to Mu&#x27;awiya, who fulfilled his promise to him.

The next morning, Qays ibn Sa&#x27;d took charge of Hasan&#x27;s troops as the second-in-command and denounced Ubayd Allah in a sermon. Mu&#x27;awiya now sent a contingent to force surrender but was pushed back twice. He then offered bribes to Qays in a letter, which he refused. As the news of the mutiny against Hasan and the attempt at his life arrived, however, both sides abstained from fighting and awaited further developments. Veccia Vaglieri writes that the Iraqis were reluctant to fight and a group deserted every day. By one account, 8,000 men out of 12,000 followed Ubayd Allah&#x27;s example and joined Mu&#x27;awiya. When Hasan learned about this, al-Ya&#x27;qubi writes that he summoned the Iraqi nobles and reproached them for their unreliability and fickle-mindedness, echoing the speeches of Ali after Siffin.

====Treaty with Mu&#x27;awiya====

Mu&#x27;awiya now sent envoys to propose that Hasan abdicate in his favor to spare Muslim blood. In return, Mu&#x27;awiya was ready to designate Hasan as his successor, grant him safety, and offer him a large financial settlement. Hasan accepted the overture in principle and sent his representative(s) to Mu&#x27;awiya, who sent them back to Hasan with &quot;carte blanche&quot;, inviting him to dictate whatever he wanted. Hasan wrote that he would surrender the Muslim rule to Mu&#x27;awiya if he would comply with the Quran and , his successor would be appointed by a council (&quot;shura&quot;), the people would remain safe, and Hasan&#x27;s supporters would receive amnesty. His letter was witnessed by two representatives, who carried it to Mu&#x27;awiya. Hasan thus renounced the caliphate in August 661 after a seven-month reign. This year is considered by a number of the early Muslim sources as &#x27;the year of unity&#x27; and is generally regarded as the start of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s caliphate.

===== Terms of the treaty =====
Veccia Vaglieri finds certain variants of the treaty impossible to reconcile. She lists several conditions in the early sources and questions their veracity, including an annual payment of one or two million dirhams to Hasan, a single payment of five million dirhams from the treasury of Kufa, annual revenues from variously named districts in Persia, succession of Hasan to Mu&#x27;awiya or a council () after Mu&#x27;awiya, and preference for the Banu Hashim over the Banu Umayyad in pensions. Another condition was that Mu&#x27;awiya should end the ritual cursing of Ali in mosques, writes Mavani.

Jafri similarly notes that the terms are recorded differently and ambiguously by al-Tabari, Dinawari, Ibn Abd al-Barr, and Ibn al-Athir, while al-Ya&#x27;qubi and al-Mas&#x27;udi () are silent about them. In particular, Jafri finds the timing of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s &quot;carte blanche&quot; problematic in al-Tabari&#x27;s account. Al-Tabari also mentions a single payment of five million dirhams to Hasan from the treasury of Kufa, which Jafri rejects because the treasury of Kufa was already in Hasan&#x27;s possession at the time. He adds that Ali regularly emptied the treasury and distributed the funds among the public, and this is also reported by Veccia Vaglieri. Jafri then argues that the most comprehensive account is the one given by Ahmad ibn A&#x27;tham, probably taken from al-Mada&#x27;ini, who recorded the terms in two parts. The first part is the conditions proposed by Abd Allah ibn Nawfal, who negotiated on Hasan&#x27;s behalf with Mu&#x27;awiya in Maskin. The second part is what Hasan stipulated in &quot;carte blanche&quot;. These two sets of conditions together encompass all the conditions scattered in the early sources.

Jafri thus concludes that Hasan&#x27;s final conditions in &quot;carte blanche&quot; were that Mu&#x27;awiya should act according to the Quran, , and the conduct of the Rashidun caliphs, that the people should remain safe, and that the successor to Mu&#x27;awiya should be appointed by a council. These conditions are echoed by Madelung, who adds that Hasan made no financial stipulations in his peace proposal and Mu&#x27;awiya consequently made no payments to him, contrary to the &quot;Umayyad propaganda&quot; reflected in the account of al-Zuhri, quoted by al-Tabari. Since Ali and his house rejected the conduct of Abu Bakr and Umar in the after Umar in 23/644, Jafri believes that the clause about following the Rashidun caliphs was inserted by later Sunni authors. That Mu&#x27;awiya agreed to an amnesty for the supporters of Ali indicates that the revenge for Uthman was a pretext for him to seize the caliphate, according to Jafri.

=== Abdication ===
In the surrender ceremony, Mu&#x27;awiya demanded Hasan to publicly apologize. Hasan rose and reminded the people that he and Husayn were Muhammad&#x27;s only grandsons and the right to the caliphate was his and not Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s, but he had surrendered it to avoid bloodshed. Mu&#x27;awiya then spoke and recanted his earlier promises to Hasan and others, saying that those promises were made to shorten the war. As reported by the Mu&#x27;tazilite Ibn Abi&#x27;l-Hadid () and Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani (), Mu&#x27;awiya added that he had not fought the Iraqis so that they would practice Islam, which they were already doing, but to be their master (). Al-Baladhuri writes that Mu&#x27;awiya then gave the Kufans three days to pledge allegiance or be killed. After this, the people rushed to vow allegiance to Mu&#x27;awiya. Hasan left Kufa for Medina but soon received a request from Mu&#x27;awiya to subdue a Kharijite revolt near Kufa. He wrote back to Mu&#x27;awiya that he had given up his claim to the caliphate for the sake of peace and compromise, not to fight on his side.

=== Retirement ===
Between his abdication in 41/661 and his death in 50/670, Hasan lived quietly in Medina and did not engage in politics. In compliance with the peace treaty, Hasan declined requests from (often small) Shia groups to lead them against Mu&#x27;awiya. He was nevertheless considered the head of the house of Muhammad by the Banu Hashim and Ali&#x27;s partisans, who had probably pinned their hopes on his succession to Mu&#x27;awiya. The Sunni al-Baladhuri in his &quot;Ansab&quot; writes that Hasan sent tax collectors to the Fasa and Darabjird provinces of Iran in accordance with the treaty but the governor of Basra, instructed by Mu&#x27;awiya, incited the people against Hasan and his tax collectors were driven out of the two provinces. Madelung regards this account as fictitious because Hasan had just refused to join Mu&#x27;awiya in fighting the Kharijites. He adds that Hasan had made no financial stipulations in his peace proposal and Mu&#x27;awiya consequently made no payments to him. Madelung suggests that the relations between the two men deteriorated when Mu&#x27;awiya realized that Hasan would not actively support his regime.

== Death ==

Hasan most likely died on 2 April 670 (5 Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal 50 AH), though other given dates are 49, 50, 48, 58 and 59 AH. Veccia Vaglieri suggests that Hasan died from an illness or poisoning, while the early sources are nearly unanimous that Hasan was poisoned.

=== Complicity of Mu&#x27;awiya ===
Mu&#x27;awiya is usually identified as the instigator in the murder of Hasan. Aside from the Shia sources, this is also the view of some notable Sunni historians, including al-Waqidi (), al-Mada&#x27;ini, Umar ibn Shabba (), al-Baladhuri, al-Haytham ibn Adi (), and Abu Bakr ibn Hafs. These reports are nevertheless suppressed by al-Tabari, perhaps because he found them insignificant or far more likely because he was concerned for the faith of the common people () in this and similar instances, as suggested by Madelung and Donaldson (). Some other early Sunni sources deny the poisoning, saying that Hasan died of &quot;consumption.&quot;

At the time of his abdication, Hasan was about thirty-eight years old while Mu&#x27;awiya was fifty-eight. Jafri suggests that the age difference presented a problem for Mu&#x27;awiya, who planned to designate his son Yazid () as his successor, in violation of the peace treaty with Hasan. Jafri thus believes that Mu&#x27;wiya should be suspected in the murder of Hasan, which removed an obstacle to the succession of his son. This view is echoed by Momen and Madelung.

=== Historical accounts ===
Hasan did not disclose who he suspected of his poisoning, fearing that the wrong person might be punished. The Shia al-Mufid () reports that Hasan&#x27;s wife Ja&#x27;da bint al-Ash&#x27;ath poisoned him with the promise of 100,000 dirhams from Mu&#x27;awiya and marriage to his son Yazid. Jafri writes that the majority of Sunni and Shia reports are similar to this one, including those by Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani, al-Mas&#x27;udi (), and al-Ya&#x27;qubi. In contrast, Ahmed regards these reports as &quot;Alid propaganda&quot; against al-Ash&#x27;ath, Ja&#x27;da&#x27;s father and the prominent Kufan tribal chief who undermined Ali at Siffin (657) by supporting the arbitration, and sabotaged Ali&#x27;s campaign after being bribed by Mu&#x27;awiya, according to Madelung. As with Jafri, Veccia Vaglieri notes that many early sources hold Ja&#x27;da bin al-Ash&#x27;ath responsible for poisoning Hasan at the instigation of Mu&#x27;awiya, though she also observes that al-Ash&#x27;ath was regarded as a traitor by the Shia who might have transferred the blame to his daughter.

Alternatively, the Sunni al-Haytham ibn Adi identifies the daughter of Suhayl ibn Amr as the murderer&quot;.&quot; Another account by the Sunni al-Waqidi pins the crime on a servant of Hasan at the instigation of Mu&#x27;awiya. Yet another account is that Yazid proposed to Zaynab bint Ja&#x27;far ibn Abi Talib, who refused and instead married Hasan. The enraged Yazid subsequently had Hasan poisoned.

=== Forensics investigation ===
A recent article by Burke et al. examined the circumstances surrounding Hasan&#x27;s death. Using mineralogical, medical, and chemical evidence, they suggested that the mineral calomel (mercury(I) chloride, Hg2Cl2), sourced from the Byzantine Empire, was the substance primarily responsible for Hasan&#x27;s death. Because historical sources indicate that another member of Hasan&#x27;s household also suffered similar symptoms, the article considers Hasan&#x27;s wife to be the prime suspect. The article cites a historical document, according to which the Byzantine emperor (likely Constantine IV) sent Mu&#x27;awiya a poisoned drink at the request of the latter. The authors thus conclude that their forensic hypothesis is consistent with the historical narrative that Hasan was poisoned by his wife Ja&#x27;da at the instigation of Mu&#x27;awiya and with the involvement of the Byzantine emperor.

=== Burial ===

Before his death, Hasan had instructed his family to bury him next to Muhammad. According to Madelung, if they &quot;feared evil,&quot; Hasan asked them to bury him near his mother in al-Baqi cemetery. The Umayyad governor of Medina, Sa&#x27;id ibn al-As, was not opposed to burying Hasan near Muhammad, whereas Marwan ibn al-Hakam strongly opposed it, arguing that Uthman had been buried in al-Baqi. In his opposition, Marwan was joined by Muhammad&#x27;s widow Aisha, who is often considered hostile to Ali.

Muhammad&#x27;s companion Abu Hurayra unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Marwan to allow Hasan&#x27;s burial next to Muhammad by reminding him of Muhammad&#x27;s high esteem for Hasan and Husayn. Supporters of Husayn and Marwan from the Banu Hashim and Banu Umayyad, respectively, soon gathered with weapons. Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya reportedly intervened and reminded Hasan&#x27;s burial request. He was then buried in al-Baqi. Dinawari writes the Umayyads shot arrows at the body during the standoff, and this is also the Shia view. Madelung suggests that Mu&#x27;awiya later rewarded Marwan for his stand by reinstating him as the governor of Medina. As Hasan&#x27;s body was carried to al-Baqi, however, Marwan reportedly joined the procession and paid tribute to a man &quot;whose forbearance () weighed mountains.&quot; Following the norms, Hasan&#x27;s funeral prayer was led by Sa&#x27;id ibn al-As, the governor of Medina. Hasan&#x27;s tomb was later made a domed shrine, which was destroyed twice by the Wahhabis first in 1806 and then 1927.

== Family life ==
Sources differ about Hasan&#x27;s wives and children. The account of Ibn Sa&#x27;d is considered the most reliable, reporting that Hasan had fifteen sons and nine daughters with six wives and three known concubines. His first marriage was contracted with Ja&#x27;da, daughter of the Kinda chief al-Ash&#x27;ath ibn Qays, soon after Ali relocated to Kufa. Madelung suggests that Ali with this marriage intended to establish ties with the powerful Yemeni tribes in Kufa. Hasan had no children with Ja&#x27;da, who is often accused of poisoning him. Umm Bashir was Hasan&#x27;s second wife and bore him his eldest son Zayd, his daughter Umm al-Husayn, and probably another daughter Umm al-Hasan. Umm Bashir was the daughter of Abu Mas&#x27;ud Uqba ibn Amr, who had opposed the Kufan revolt against Uthman. Madelung writes that Ali was hoping to bring Abu Mas&#x27;ud to his side with the marriage.

After his abdication and return to Medina, Hasan married Khawla, daughter of the Fazara chief Manzur ibn Zabban. Khawla already had two sons and a daughter from Muhammad ibn Talha, who was killed in the Battle of the Camel. After her father protested that he had been ignored, Hasan presented Khawla to her father and remarried her with his approval. Khawla bore Hasan his son, Hasan. Hasan in Medina also married Hafsa bint Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr. It is said that al-Mundhir ibn al-Zubayr was in love with her and his rumors compelled Hasan to divorce her. The rumors also ended Hafsa&#x27;s next marriage and she eventually married al-Mundhir. Hasan also married Umm Ishaq bint Talha ibn Ubayd Allah. Mu&#x27;awiya reputedly asked her brother Ishaq ibn Talha to marry her to Yazid but Ishaq married her to Hasan instead and she bore a son named Talha. Another wife of Hasan was Hind bint Suhayl ibn Amr, the widow of Abd al-Rahman ibn Attab, who was divorced by Abd Allah ibn Amir. Hasan had no children with Hind. Hasan&#x27;s other children were probably from concubines, including Qasim and Abd Allah (or Abu Bakr), both of whom were killed in the Battle of Karbala (680), and Umm Abd Allah, who married Zayn al-Abidin and bore him Muhammad al-Baqir, the fifth Shia Imam. Hasan&#x27;s descendants are usually known as , though the usage of the term is sometimes extended to Husayn&#x27;s descendants as well.

=== Number of consorts ===
Tendentious (Sunni) reports describe that Hasan married seventy (or ninety) women in his lifetime and had a harem of three hundred concubines. Madelung regards these as absurd, and Pierce believes that these accusations were made by later Sunni writers who were nevertheless unable to list more than sixteen names. Madelung writes that most of the claims were by al-Mada&#x27;ini and were often vague; some had a clear defamatory intent. In particular, the ninety-wives allegation was first made by Muhammad al-Kalbi and later picked up by al-Mada&#x27;ini, who was unable to list more than eleven names, five of whom are uncertain or highly doubtful.

Veccia Vaglieri holds that the marriages of Hasan received little contemporary censure. In contrast, Lammens () suggests that Hasan married and divorced so frequently that he was called () and his behavior earned Ali new enemies. Madelung rejects this claim, saying that Hasanliving in his father&#x27;s householdcould not enter into any marriages not arranged (or approved) by Ali. In particular, the narratives in which Ali warns the Kufans not to marry their daughters to Hasan are fabricated. Madelung believes that Hasan&#x27;s marriages in Ali&#x27;s lifetime were intended to strengthen political alliances, as evidenced by Hasan reserving his (Abu Muhammad) for his first son with his first freely-chosen wife Khawla. When Muhammad died in childhood, Hasan chose Khawla&#x27;s second son Hasan as his primary heir.

=== Divorces ===
Hasan divorced his wife Hafsa out of propriety when she was accused by al-Mundhir. Hafsa&#x27;s next marriage ended similarly. When she finally married al-Mundhir, Hasan visited the couple and forgave al-Mundhir for spreading those false rumors out of love for Hafsa. Hasan also returned Khawla to her father Manzur when he objected that he had been ignored and then remarried her with his approval. Hasan is also said to have divorced his wife Hind when he saw evidence of renewed love by her former husband.

For Madelung, Hasan&#x27;s divorces do not indicate any inordinate sexual appetite. He also writes that Hasan comes across as noble and forbearing in dealing with his wives. Madelung cites Hasan&#x27;s advice to Husayn to marry his widow Umm Ishaq after his death. When he was poisoned, Hasan also reputedly refrained from disclosing the suspect in his household to Husayn.

==Assessment and legacy==
=== Appearance and temperament ===
Hasan has been described as closely resembling Muhammad in his appearance. Madelung suggests that Hasan might have also inherited Muhammad&#x27;s temperament and describes him as a pacifist. Veccia Vaglieri writes that he was of mild disposition (), generous, pious, and known to have made several pilgrimages on foot. While Hasan is described as a good orator, he might have also suffered from a speech defect, according to Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani. In contrast to Hasan, Madelung suggests that Husayn might have inherited his father&#x27;s &quot;fighting spirit.&quot;

=== Abdication ===
The sources hostile to Hasan interpret his peace treaty with Mu&#x27;awiya as a sign of weakness, saying that Hasan intended to surrender from the beginning. Some authors instead suggest that Hasan&#x27;s decision to abdicate was motivated by the lure of the life of ease and luxury, while Western historians tend to criticize Hasan for ceding the caliphate.

Other sources reject these criticisms, saying that Hasan&#x27;s abdication was inevitable after the Kufans&#x27; mutiny, similar to Ali&#x27;s acceptance of the arbitration proposal at Siffin (657). These sources contend that Hasan was motivated by the desire for unity and peace in the Muslim community, similar to Ali after Muhammad&#x27;s death. Shia historians view Hasan&#x27;s abdication as the only realistic course of action, given the Kufans&#x27; weak support and Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s overwhelming military superiority. Their view is echoed by Veccia Vaglieri. Sunni sources maintain that Hasan abdicated because of his preference for peace and his aversion to bloodshed and bellicose politics. The first two of these three reasons are also given by the Shia Tabatabai ().

=== Muslim view ===
Hasan is a member of the (Muhammad&#x27;s family) and belongs also to the , namely, Muhammad, Ali, Fatima, and their two sons. While all Muslims revere the , it is the Shia who hold them in the highest esteem, regarding them as the rightful leaders of the Muslim community.

==== Quran ====

&quot;Verse of Mubahala&quot;: After his unsuccessful debate with the Najranite Christians in 10/631-2, Muhammad is said to have received verse 3:61, which readsMadelung argues that &#x27;our sons&#x27; in verse 3:61 must refer to Muhammad&#x27;s grandsons, namely, Hasan and Husayn. Later at the , Muhammad gathered Ali, Fatima, Hasan, and Husayn under his cloak and addressed them as his , according to some Shia and Sunni sources, including the canonical &quot;Sahih Muslim&quot; and &quot;Sahih al-Tirmidhi&quot;. The five are thus known also as the (). Madelung writes that their inclusion by Muhammad in this significant ritual must have raised the religious rank of his family. A similar view is voiced by Lalani.
&quot;Verse of purification&quot;: The last passage of verse 33:33 reads

Shia Islam limits the to Muhammad, Ali, Fatima, Hasan, and Husayn. There are various views in Sunni Islam, though a typical compromise is to include also Muhammad&#x27;s wives in the . Verse 33:33 is regarded in Shia Islam as evidence of the infallibility of the .

&quot;Verse of Mawadda&quot;: Verse 42:23 includes the passage

The word kinsfolk () in this verse is interpreted by the Shia as the , namely, Ali, Fatima, Hasan, and Husayn. Ibn Ishaq () narrates a prophetic hadith to this effect, and this is also the view of the Sunni Baydawi, al-Razi, and Ibn Maghazili, though most Sunni authors reject the Shia view and offer various alternatives. Hasan referred to verse 42:24 in his inaugural speech as the caliph in 661, saying that he belonged to the whose love God has made obligatory in the Quran.

&quot;Verses 76:5-22&quot;: These verses are connected to the in most Shia and some Sunni sources, including the works of the Shia al-Tabarsi (), and the Sunni al-Qurtubi () and al-Alusi (). According to these exegetes, verses 76:5-22 were revealed after Ali, Fatima, Hasan, and Husayn gave away their only meal of the day to beggars who visited their home, for three consecutive days. In particular, verses 76:7-12 read
====Mu&#x27;tazila Islam====
In Mu&#x27;tazila Islam, only a wrong deed by an unrepentant imam would disqualify him from the imamate after receiving oaths of allegiance. Otherwise, an imam cannot resign or willingly pledge his allegiance to another person. The Mu&#x27;tazilite al-Qadi Abd al-Jabbar () suggests that Hasan reluctantly made peace and unwillingly pledged his allegiance to Mu&#x27;awiya after realizing the Kufans&#x27; weak support for war. This reluctant pledge of allegiance did not disqualify him from the imamate or legitimize Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s caliphate. The Mu&#x27;tazilite Ibn al-Malahimi () adds, &quot;How can it be imagined that Hasan, who planned to fight Mu&#x27;awiya to secure his oath of allegiance, would agree to relinquish the caliphate without reluctance?&quot;

==== Sunni Islam ====
During the eighth and ninth centuries, there was a diversity of opinions about which caliphs were (&quot;rightly-guided&quot;), meaning those whose actions and opinions were considered worthy of emulation from a religious point of view. After the ninth century, however, the first four caliphs became canonical as in Sunni Islam: Abu Bakr (), Umar (), Uthman () and Ali (). The Umayyad caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz () was cited as the fifth caliph by the Sunni hadith collector Abu Dawud al-Sijistani (). Another hypothesis may have included Hasan as the fifth caliph because his six-month reign was needed to complete the thirty-year period after Abu Bakr&#x27;s ascension which was reportedly predicted by Muhammad as the length of the prophetic succession. This is also implied by Abu Dawud al-Tayalisi&#x27;s version of this hadith, which avoided counting Hasan as the fifth caliph by adding six months to Umar&#x27;s caliphate.

Sunni Muslims justify Hasan&#x27;s peace treaty with Mu&#x27;awiya with a hadith, attributed to Muhammad, which reportedly predicted that Hasan would unite two warring Muslim parties. By legitimizing Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s caliphate, they view the peace treaty as a voluntary resignation from the caliphate. More generally, an imam in Sunni Islam cannot be ousted or resign if he is aware of the divisiveness of his decision but he can abdicate if he considers his resignation to be in the best interest of Muslims. Hasan&#x27;s abdication was a voluntary decision to avoid bloodshed.

==== Shia Islam ====

Hasan al-Mujtaba () is regarded by the Shia as their second imam. Even though his abdication was criticized by some contemporary followers, he continued to be regarded until his death in 670 as the leader (imam) of the supporters of Ali . Developed by the later Shia Imams, the Shia doctrine of Imamate explains that Muhammad was succeeded by Ali and then by Hasan through divine decrees. As the rightful successor of Muhammad in Shia Islam, Hasan&#x27;s all-inclusive temporal and religious authority thus came from divinely-inspired designation (), which could not be annulled by abdication to Mu&#x27;awiya, who usurped only the temporal authority. Indeed, the imamate and caliphate are viewed as separate institutions in Shia Islam until such time that God would make the Imam victorious. A prophetic hadith in some Shia and Sunni sources states that Hasan and Husayn were imams &quot;whether they stand up or sit down&quot; (ascend to the caliphate or not).

As for the abdication, Shia theologians cite the disintegration of Hasan&#x27;s corps, abandonment by his allies, the looting of his military campground, and his assassination attempt to justify Hasan&#x27;s peace with Mu&#x27;awiya. Alternatively, Veccia Vaglieri suggests that the Shia views Hasan&#x27;s abdication in light of his pious detachment. Hasan&#x27;s infallibility () in Shia Islam further vindicates his course of action. The Shia Sharif al-Murtaza () writes that Hasan reluctantly made peace to end the civil war, and his subsequent pledge to Mu&#x27;awiya is viewed by the Shia as an act of . Shia theologians perceive the treaty as a ceasefire () or agreement () rather than an alliance with Mu&#x27;awiya. To support this claim, they cite Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s violation of the treaty, the stipulation therein that Mu&#x27;awiya should not be called (), and Hasan&#x27;s refusal to fight the Kharijites for Mu&#x27;awiya.

==== Miracles ====
According to Donaldson, fewer miracles are attributed to Hasan than to other Shia Imams. Veccia Vaglieri disagrees, listing the following: Hasan recited the Quran when he was born and praised God.Later, in life, he resurrected a dead man and a dead palm tree bore fruits at his request. God sent down a meal for his companions from the skies.

== Literature and TV ==
=== Literature ===
Persian literature about Hasan can be divided into two categories: historical and mystical. Historical literature includes Hasan&#x27;s life, imamate, his peace with Mu&#x27;awiya, and his death. Mystical literature showcases his virtues and his prominent position in Shia spirituality.
Hasan&#x27;s life has been the subject of poetry from Sanai () to the present. The themes are his virtues, Muhammad&#x27;s admiration of him, and his suffering and death. Poets include Sanai (&quot;Hadiqat al Haqiqa&quot;), Attar of Nishapur, Ghavami Razi, Rumi, &#x27;Ala&#x27; al-Dawla Simnani, Ibn Yamin, Khwaju Kermani, Salman Savoji, Hazin Lahiji, Naziri Neyshabouri, Vesal Shirazi, and Adib al-Malak Farahani.

=== Television ===
The series &quot;Loneliest Leader&quot;, directed in 1996 by Mehdi Fakhimzadeh, narrates Hasan&#x27;s life, his peace with Mu&#x27;awiya, and the condition of the Islamic community after his assassination. The events leading up to Hasan&#x27;s peace and his attempted assassination in al-Mada&#x27;in are also mentioned in the series &quot;Mokhtarnameh&quot; by Davood Mirbagheri. &quot;Muawiya, Hasan and Husayn&quot; is an Arab series about Hasan and Husayn which has been criticized as anti-Shia.

<text>Craig Alan Biggio (; born December 14, 1965) is an American former baseball second baseman, outfielder and catcher who played 20 seasons in Major League Baseball for the Houston Astros, from 1988 to 2007. A seven-time National League (NL) All-Star often regarded as the greatest all-around player in Astros history, he is the only player ever to be named an All-Star and to be awarded Silver Slugger Award at both catcher and second base. With longtime teammates Jeff Bagwell and Lance Berkman, he formed the core of the &quot;Killer B&#x27;s&quot; who led Houston to six playoff appearances from 1997 to 2005, culminating in the franchise&#x27;s first World Series appearance in 2005. At the end of his career, he ranked sixth in NL history in games played (2,850), fifth in at bats (10,876), 21st in hits (3,060), and seventh in runs scored (1,844). His 668 career doubles ranked sixth in major league history, and are the second-most ever by a right-handed hitter; his 56 doubles in 1999 were the most in the major leagues in 63 years.

Biggio, who batted .300 four times and scored 100 runs eight times, holds Astros franchise records for most career games, at bats, hits, runs scored, doubles, total bases (4,711) and extra base hits (1,014), and ranks second in runs batted in (1,175), walks (1,160) and stolen bases (414). He also holds the NL record for most times leading off a game with a home run (53), and is one of only five players with 250 home runs and 400 steals. A four-time Gold Glove Award winner who led NL second basemen in assists six times and putouts five times, he retired ranking fourth in NL history in games at second base (1,989), sixth in assists (5,448) and fielding percentage (.984), seventh in putouts (3,992) and double plays (1,153), and eighth in total chances (9,596). He was the ninth player in the 3,000 hit club to collect all his hits with one team. Biggio also led the NL in times hit by pitch five times, with his career total of 285 trailing only Hughie Jennings&#x27; 287 in major league history.

One of the most admired players of his generation, Biggio received the 2005 Hutch Award for perseverance through adversity and the 2007 Roberto Clemente Award for sportsmanship and community service. The Astros retired the number 7 in his honor the year following his retirement. Since 2008, Biggio has served as special assistant to the general manager of the Astros. In 2015, Biggio was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, becoming the first member of the Hall to be depicted in an Astros uniform on his plaque.

==Early life==

===High school===
Craig Biggio graduated from Kings Park High School in Kings Park, New York, where he excelled as a multi-sport varsity athlete. Most notably, after the 1983 season Biggio was awarded the Hansen Award, which recognized him as being the best football player in Suffolk County. However, Biggio&#x27;s passion lay with baseball, such that he turned down football scholarships for the opportunity to play baseball for Seton Hall University.

===College career===
Although Biggio was an infielder, Seton Hall coach Mike Sheppard switched him to catcher because the team was in need of one. In 1986, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox. Biggio was an All-American baseball player at Seton Hall, where he played with other future Major League Baseball stars Mo Vaughn and John Valentin. Biggio, Vaughn and Valentin, along with Marteese Robinson, were featured in the book &quot;The Hit Men and the Kid Who Batted Ninth&quot; by David Siroty, which chronicled their rise from college teammates to the major leagues.

Biggio was selected by the Houston Astros in the first round (22nd overall) of the 1987 draft. Biggio remains Seton Hall&#x27;s leader in triples, second in runs scored, and is in the top 10 in 18 other single-season and career categories. In 1996, Biggio was inducted into the Seton Hall Hall of Fame and had his number 44 retired in 2012.

==Major league career==

===Early career===

====As catcher====

Biggio was called up as a catcher midway through the 1988 season, having batted .344 in his minor league career. In 1989, his first full season, Biggio became the Astros&#x27; starting catcher. He won the Silver Slugger Award in 1989. He was a very speedy runner, and an adept base stealer. Astros management, in an attempt to keep the rigors of catching from sapping Biggio&#x27;s speed, tried him in the outfield part-time in 1990, as he had played 18 games there in the minors. Yogi Berra mentioned Biggio&#x27;s height in his book &quot;You Can Observe A Lot By Watching&quot;, saying, &quot;I always identified with short catchers—they don&#x27;t have to stand up as far&quot;.

====Emergence of the &quot;Killer B&#x27;s&quot;====
The Astros acquired first baseman Jeff Bagwell prior to the start of the 1991 season, who, like Biggio, spent his entire major league career with Houston. A power hitter with higher-than-normal on-base skills, Bagwell played 15 seasons, thus completely overlapping his career with Biggio&#x27;s and wound up Houston&#x27;s career leader in home runs. The pair came to be known as the &quot;Killer B&#x27;s&quot;, synonymous with the Astros throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. A prodigious offensive and defensive unit, during their 10 peak seasons from 1994 to 2003, they appeared in nine All-Star Games, won five Gold Gloves, ranked in the top five of the Most Valuable Player Award voting five times and averaged 226 runs scored. They totaled 689 home runs, 2,485 RBI and 3,083 runs scored while the Astros advanced to the postseason six times. Other players that the Astros later acquired whose names started with the letter B also were included in this distinction, including Derek Bell, Sean Berry, Lance Berkman, and Carlos Beltrán.

Biggio considered free agency with a team other than the Astros just once: after the 1995 season ended, teams such as the St. Louis Cardinals, Colorado Rockies, and the San Diego Padres; the Rockies and Cardinals were the most serious, with the former offering $20 million for four years while the latter approached him with a five-year, $25 million contract. However, Biggio took a four-year deal worth $22 million to stay with the Astros.

====Shift to second base====

The Astros finally convinced Biggio to convert to second base in spring training of 1992, even though Biggio had made the National League All-Star team as a catcher the year before. Biggio made the All-Star team for the second time in 1992, becoming the first player in the history of baseball to be an All-Star at both catcher and second base. It is rare for a major league catcher to make a successful transition to middle infielder; if a catcher changes positions, it is usually to first base, or occasionally to outfield or third base.

Biggio became known as a reliable, hustling, consistent leadoff hitter, with unusual power for a second baseman. He holds the National League record for most home runs to lead off a game, with 53. Manager Larry Dierker, hired in 1997 by the Astros, moved Biggio from the second spot in the lineup to leadoff. His statistics reflect this, having consistently good marks in hitting, on-base percentage, hit-by-pitch, runs, stolen bases, and doubles throughout his career. Between 1994 and 1999, Biggio led the National League in doubles three times, runs scored twice, and stolen bases once. Biggio was also known for intentionally keeping his batting helmet dirty. In 1997, he completed an entire season without grounding into a double play, becoming the fifth player to ever do so in MLB history. In 1998, he became the first player since Tris Speaker to collect fifty doubles and fifty stolen bases in the same season, doing so with his 50th stolen base on September 23 (Biggio and Speaker were the only players to record the feat in the 20th century). Biggio also hit 20 home runs to join the 20–50 club. He also excelled defensively at second base; between 1992 and 1999, Biggio led all National League second basemen in assists six times and putouts five times. He won four consecutive Gold Glove Awards from 1994 to 1997.

===Career setbacks: Injury and the outfield===
Biggio played 1,800 games without a trip to the disabled list until August 1, 2000, when he suffered a season-ending knee injury. In the play in which Biggio was injured, the Florida Marlins&#x27; Preston Wilson (who would later become Biggio&#x27;s teammate) slid into second base, trying to stop a double play, and hit Biggio&#x27;s planted left leg, tearing the ACL and MCL in Biggio&#x27;s knee. Biggio rebounded with a good season in 2001, but had a lackluster performance in 2002, with only a .253 average, his lowest since entering the league; a highlight occurred on April 8, when he hit for the cycle for the only time in his career.

However, he improved slightly for the 2003 season, averaging .264 with 166 hits despite being asked by management to move to center field after the signing of free agent All-Star second baseman Jeff Kent. In 2004, he put up numbers more typical for his career, batting .281 with 178 hits, including a career-high 24 homers. Biggio moved to yet another new position, left field, midway through the 2004 season to accommodate Beltrán, who was acquired in a trade to help bolster the Astros&#x27; struggling offense. The Astros were 44-44 at the All-Star break. Having fired Jimy Williams for Phil Garner, the Astros went 48-26, which included a 36-10 stretch to end the year while narrowly clinching the NL wild card on the final day of the regular season. In the 2004 National League Division Series, the Astros were matched against the Atlanta Braves, which was the fourth time the two teams were playing each other in the past seven years, and the Braves had won each of the matchups. Biggio batted 8-for-20 (.400) in a series that went the full five game distance. In Game 4, he hit a home run, which was his first career postseason home run. In Game 5 in Atlanta, the Astros were attempting to clinch the series after blowing Game 4. In the seventh inning, leading 4-2 in the seventh inning, Biggio was at the plate with Jose Vizcaino at second base with two out. Biggio hit a single that drove Vizcaino in from second that would start a two-out rally, as Biggio and three further batters would go on to score to make a 9-2 lead. Two innings later, the Astros won the game 12-3 to clinch the first postseason series victory in Astros history. The Astros went to the 2004 National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Biggio went 6-for-32 (.188) as the series went the full distance. Biggio had one RBI in the series, which was a leadoff home run in Game 7. The Astros led 2-1 in the sixth inning before the Cardinals rallied to win 5-2 to end the season.

===Late career: Return to second base and milestones===

====World Series appearance (2005)====
In February 2005, Biggio and Bagwell were inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. After Kent left for the Dodgers, Biggio resumed playing at second base and set a new career-high with 26 home runs. He also reached 1,000 RBI, becoming the second Astro to do so, following Bagwell. On September 5 of that season, he helped the Astros against the Philadelphia Phillies in a critical game late in the season; the Astros were narrowly ahead of the Phillies (and other teams) for the lone Wild Card spot. The Phillies had taken the lead late 6-5 and had Billy Wagner in relief. However, with two out in the ninth inning and two men on base, Biggio hit a home run that gave the Astros the lead that they did not give up in an 8–5 victory (the Astros went on to win the Wild Card by one game).

As they had done the previous year, the Astros beat the Braves to advance to the NLCS. They avenged their previous loss to the St. Louis Cardinals in six games to win their first league pennant. In the clinching sixth game, Biggio did his part with a third inning single that drove in a run in the 5-1 victory. After having played 4,714 games and their entire major league careers together in Houston, Biggio and Bagwell appeared in their first and only World Series that year against the Chicago White Sox. The White Sox swept the Astros to secure the championship with the lowest run-scoring differential in a World Series sweep. Both Biggio and Bagwell received &quot;Baseball America&quot;&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award after the 2005 season. On May 23, 2006, Biggio became the 23rd player in MLB history to reach 10,000 at-bats.

====3,000 career hits (2007)====

On June 28, 2007, Biggio became the 27th player in the history of Major League Baseball to join the 3,000 hit club, with a single against Colorado Rockies pitcher Aaron Cook. Though Biggio was tagged out on the play attempting to stretch it into a double, drawing the throw allowed a run to score. The game action paused while Biggio shared the moment with his wife and children. Longtime friend and former teammate Jeff Bagwell emerged from the Astros clubhouse to congratulate him. Biggio became the first player in Astros history to accumulate 3,000 hits. It was Biggio&#x27;s third hit of the game, and he went on to accumulate two more later in the game, one in the ninth inning and one in the eleventh inning. He became the first player in history to record his 3,000th hit and have five hits in the same game. Biggio&#x27;s 3,000th hit came on the same day that Frank Thomas hit his milestone 500th career home run, both marks which are considered to guarantee induction into the Hall of Fame.

In anticipation of Biggio&#x27;s reaching 3,000 hits, the Astros installed a digital counter just left of center field displaying his current hit total.

With 668 doubles, he ended his career in fifth place on the all-time list. Biggio also holds the record for the most doubles by a right-handed hitter. He is the only player in the history of baseball with 3,000 hits, 600 doubles, 400 stolen bases, and 250 home runs. He ranks 20th on the all-time hits list, though of those 20 players he ranks 19th in career batting average.

Biggio fell nine home runs short of joining the career 300–300 club (300 homers and 300 stolen bases). He would have become only the seventh player to achieve the feat. Incidentally, this also caused him to fall short of the 3,000 hits, 300 homers and 300 stolen bases mark; he would have been only the second player in history to reach that club, the other being Willie Mays.

===Retirement===

On July 24, 2007, Biggio announced his retirement, effective at the end of the season (his 20th season with the club, a franchise record). Hours later, with the Astros locked in a 3–3 tie with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Biggio hit a grand slam in the 6th inning. The Astros went on to win the game 7–4.

In the penultimate game of his career, Biggio started as a catcher and caught 2 innings for the Astros. He also hit a double in his first at-bat of the game.

A sellout, record-breaking crowd packed Minute Maid Park on September 30, 2007, to witness Biggio&#x27;s final game. He recorded his final career hit, a double in the first inning, and scored his final career run that same inning. In his final career at-bat, he grounded the ball to third baseman Chipper Jones, who threw out the hustling Biggio by half a step. He left the field to a standing ovation from the fans, and when he was replaced defensively in the top of the 8th inning he shook hands with umpires and teammates and left to another standing ovation as he waved to the fans. The Astros won the game 3–0.

Biggio finished his career with 3,060 career hits, 668 doubles, 291 home runs, 1,175 RBI, 414 stolen bases, and a .281 batting average.

===Post-retirement===
Biggio has been a special assistant to the general manager since 2008. In this role, he works in several areas, including with the baseball operations staff in its major and minor league player development programs with special emphasis on instruction, the amateur draft and scouting, and major and minor league talent evaluation. Biggio was involved in the selection of new Astros Manager Bo Porter in 2012. Additionally, Biggio participates in the club&#x27;s community development program.

===Hit by pitch===
Over his career, Biggio gained a reputation for being hit by pitches; some observers criticized him due to the fact that many of the pitches hit him on his sizable elbow pad. Some have even gone so far as to proclaim him the &quot;king of hit batsmen&quot;. On June 29, 2005, Biggio broke the modern-era career hit-by-pitch record, previously held by Don Baylor with 267. He is second to only Hughie Jennings on the all-time list with 287. Despite being hit by a record number of pitches, Biggio never charged the mound, and had no serious injuries as a result of being hit by a pitch.

In his final season, however, Biggio was only hit three times. He was hit fewer times total between 2006 and 2007 (nine times in 2006, total of 12) than he was in 10 of his previous 11 individual seasons. In August 2007, the satirical online newspaper &quot;The Onion&quot; referenced this in the article &quot;Craig Biggio Blames Media Pressure For Stalling at 285 Hit-By-Pitches&quot;. Biggio sent an arm guard to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in recognition of his high hit-by-pitch total.

==Number retirement==

On May 23, 2008, during a pre-game ceremony, Biggio received an award for MLB.com&#x27;s This Year in Baseball 2007 Moment of the Year award for his 3,000th hit. On June 28, the Astros announced that they would retire Craig Biggio&#x27;s jersey. The Houston Astros retired his No. 7 jersey on August 17, 2008, prior to the start of a game versus the Arizona Diamondbacks. Biggio was the ninth player in Astros history to have his number retired.

==Hall of Fame candidacy==
Biggio first appeared on the writers&#x27; ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2013, the earliest possible year of consideration. He led all Hall of Fame vote-getters by being named on 68.2% of ballots cast. However, this was 39 votes shy of reaching the 75% threshold required by the BBWAA for induction. The following year he once again failed to garner enough votes to be inducted, finishing two votes shy with a voting percentage of 74.8%. This ties him with Nellie Fox (1985) and Pie Traynor (1947) for smallest margin not to get into the Hall, which received criticism.

On January 6, 2015, Biggio was rewarded for his career by being elected to the Hall of Fame. He received 82.7% of the votes and was inducted into the hall on July 26, 2015. He was the first member of the 3,000 hit club to not be elected on the first ballot. On July 29, 2021, Biggio was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s board of directors.

==Work in the community==
Biggio has received awards from various organizations, including the Hutch Award (2005) and being named one of &quot;Sporting News&quot;&#x27; Good Guys (2004). The Hutch Award is given to a player that shows competitiveness and never gives up. Part of the reason Biggio was given the award was for his multiple position changes, but also because of his work in the community and inspiring other teammates to participate as well. He also received the Roberto Clemente Award in 2007. The Roberto Clemente Award &quot;recognizes the player who best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual&#x27;s contribution to his team&quot;.

Biggio has been a supporter and lead spokesperson for the Sunshine Kids Foundation for over a decade and almost the entirety of his playing career. The organization supports children fighting cancer with exciting activities for themselves and their families. Biggio helps the organization by raising awareness of the organization by wearing a small yellow sun on his cap for interviews, batting practice, and spring training games and by holding a celebrity golf tournament in Houston each spring. Biggio hosts an annual party at Minute Maid Park for about 100 Sunshine Kids to play baseball with Biggio and some of his teammates.

With the 2006 annual golf tournament, Biggio has raised over $2 million for the organization. During 2007 spring training, MLB informed Biggio that he would no longer be allowed to wear the small yellow sun on his cap during interviews, photoshoots, or spring training. Biggio had worn the Sunshine Kids pin for over a decade. This edict was big news in Houston, and Houstonians, long known for their charitable nature and unconditional love of Biggio, reacted very negatively to MLB. After the public uproar, MLB relented and Biggio was allowed to wear the Sunshine Kids pin as he had done since becoming a spokesperson.

==Personal life==

Biggio was arrested in June 1989 and charged with drunk driving in Harris County, Texas. Astros teammate Ken Caminiti was a passenger in the car at the time of the arrest. At trial, the arresting officer testified that Biggio handed him $200 in what he believed was a bribery attempt. On October 5, he was found guilty of drunk driving. The following day, he was sentenced to two years of probation and 50 hours of community service and fined $350.

Biggio married his wife, the former Patty Egan, in 1990. At that time she was a nurse, but moved on from that career after moving to Houston, where they still live. They have three children: son Conor, born in 1993, son Cavan, born in 1995, and daughter Quinn, born in 1999. Cavan has played in Major League Baseball. From 2008 to 2013, Biggio was the head varsity baseball coach at St. Thomas High School. Biggio coached St. Thomas to back-to-back Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools (TAPPS) Class 5A state baseball titles in 2010 and 2011.

Both of Biggio&#x27;s sons played for the St. Thomas baseball team. Cavan hit a home run in the team&#x27;s 2011 championship game, while older brother Conor provided the winning offense in St. Thomas&#x27; semifinal victory. In Summer 2012, Conor played left field for the North Adams SteepleCats of the New England Collegiate Baseball League; in Summer 2013, he played outfield and second base for the North Shore Navigators of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League. Both Conor and Cavan attended the University of Notre Dame.

Biggio and his family have a home in Spring Lake, New Jersey, which they named &quot;Home Plate&quot;. Biggio&#x27;s father-in-law is former Assemblyman Joseph V. Egan, who was a longtime member of the New Jersey legislature until his 2024 retirement at age 86. Biggio is Catholic.

<text>Water Eaton is an area of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England and in the civil parish of Bletchley and Fenny Stratford. It is to the south of Fenny Stratford and contiguous with it. It is one of the ancient Buckinghamshire villages that became incorporated as part of Milton Keynes in 1967.

== History ==
By the date of designation of Milton Keynes, Water Eaton had already been virtually absorbed by the 1960s Greater London Council-built London overspill district known as the Lakes Estate. The GLC was very proud of the Lakes Estate, declaring it to be the finest in modern architecture for a working class estate, based on the &quot;Radburn design&quot; concept pioneered in Radburn, New Jersey. The Lakes Estate was one of a number of developments around Bletchley and Fenny Stratford in the 1950s and 60s, intended to resettle people from poor-quality housing in war-damaged London.

Water Eaton was formerly a hamlet in the parish of Bletchley, in 1866 Water Eaton became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished and merged with Bletchley. In 1931 the parish had a population of 180.

== Name ==
The village name &#x27;Eaton&#x27; is Old English language word referring to a farming settlement, and the whole means &#x27;farm by a river&#x27;. It is first mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book (as simply Eaton); when it was held by Geoffrey de Montbray, and was listed as having a Mill.

<doc id="419575" wikidata="Q1892702" url="?curid=419575" title="Cingulate cortex">
<text>The cingulate cortex is a part of the brain situated in the medial aspect of the cerebral cortex. The cingulate cortex includes the entire cingulate gyrus, which lies immediately above the corpus callosum, and the continuation of this in the cingulate sulcus. The cingulate cortex is usually considered part of the limbic lobe.

It receives inputs from the thalamus and the neocortex, and projects to the entorhinal cortex via the cingulum. It is an integral part of the limbic system, which is involved with emotion formation and processing, learning, and memory. The combination of these three functions makes the cingulate gyrus highly influential in linking motivational outcomes to behavior (e.g. a certain action induced a positive emotional response, which results in learning). This role makes the cingulate cortex highly important in disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. It also plays a role in executive function and respiratory control.

==Structure==
Based on cerebral cytoarchitectonics it has been divided into the Brodmann areas 23, 24, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32 and 33. The areas 26, 29 and 30 are usually referred to as the retrosplenial areas.

===Anterior cingulate cortex===

This corresponds to areas 24, 32 and 33 of Brodmann and LA of Constantin von Economo and Bailey and von Bonin. 
It is continued anteriorly by the subgenual area (Brodmann area 25), located below the genu of the corpus callosum).
It is cytoarchitectonically agranular. It has a gyral and a sulcal part. 
Anterior cingulate cortex can further be divided in the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (near the genu) and midcingulate cortex. The anterior cingulate cortex receives primarily its afferent axons from the intralaminar and midline thalamic nuclei (see thalamus). 
The nucleus anterior receives mamillo-thalamic afferences. The mamillary neurons receive axons from the subiculum. 
The whole forms a neural circuit in the limbic system known as the Papez circuit.
The anterior cingulate cortex sends axons to the anterior nucleus and through the cingulum to other Broca&#x27;s limbic areas. The ACC is involved in error and conflict detection processes.

===Posterior cingulate cortex===

This corresponds to areas 23 and 31 of Brodmann LP of von Economo and Bailey and von Bonin. Its cellular structure is granular. It is followed posteriorly by the retrosplenial cortex (area 29).
Dorsally is the granular area 31. The posterior cingulate cortex receives a great part of its afferent axons from the superficial nucleus (or nucleus superior- falsely LD-) of the thalamus (see thalamus), which itself receives axons from the subiculum. To some extent it thus duplicates Papez&#x27; circuit. It receives also direct afferents from the subiculum of the hippocampus. Posterior cingulate cortex hypometabolism (with 18F-FDG PET) has been defined in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

===Inputs of the anterior cingulate gyrus===
A retrograde tracing experiment on macaque monkeys revealed that the ventral anterior nucleus (VA) and the ventral lateral nucleus (VL) of the thalamus are connected with motor areas of the cingulate sulcus. The retrosplenial region (Brodmann&#x27;s area 26, 29 and 30) of cingulate gyrus can be divided into three parts: &quot;i.e.&quot;, retrosplenial granular cortex A, retrosplenial granular cortex B and retrosplenial dysgranular cortex. The hippocampal formation sends dense projections to retrosplenial granular cortex A and B and fewer projections to the retrosplenial dysgranular cortex. The postsubiculum sends projections to retrosplenial granular cortex A and B and to the retrosplenial dysgranular cortex. The dorsal subiculum sends projections to retrosplenial granular cortex B, while ventral subiculum sends projections to retrosplenial granular cortex A. Entorhinal cortex – caudal parts – sends projections to the retrosplenial dysgranular cortex.

===Outputs of the anterior cingulate gyrus===
The rostral cingulate gyrus (Brodmanns&#x27;s area 32) projects to the rostral superior temporal gyrus, midorbitofrontal cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex.
The ventral anterior cingulate (Brodmann&#x27;s area 24) sends projections to the anterior insular cortex, premotor cortex (Brodmann&#x27;s area 6), Brodmann&#x27;s area 8, the perirhinal area, the orbitofrontal cortex (Brodmann&#x27;s area 12), the laterobasal nucleus of amygdala, and the rostral part of the inferior parietal lobule. Injecting wheat germ agglutinin and horseradish peroxidase conjugate into the anterior cingulate gyrus of cats, revealed that the anterior cingulate gyrus has reciprocal connections with the rostral part of the thalamic posterior lateral nucleus and rostral end of the pulvinar.
The postsubiculum receives projections from the retrosplenial dysgranular cortex and the retrosplenial granular cortex A and B. The parasubiculum receives projections from the retrosplenial dysgranular cortex and retrosplenial granular cortex A. Caudal and lateral parts of the entorhinal cortex get projections from the retrosplenial dysgranular cortex, while the caudal medial entorhinal cortex receives projections from the retrosplenial granular cortex A. The retrosplenial dysgranular cortex sends projections to the perirhinal cortex. The retrosplenial granular cortex A sends projection to the rostral presubiculum.

===Outputs of the posterior cingulate gyrus===
The posterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann&#x27;s area 23) sends projections to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann&#x27;s area 9), anterior prefrontal cortex (Brodmann&#x27;s area 10), orbitofrontal cortex (Brodmanns’ area 11), the parahippocampal gyrus, posterior part of the inferior parietal lobule, the presubiculum, the superior temporal sulcus and the retrosplenial region.
The retrosplenial cortex and caudal part of the cingulate cortex are connected with rostral prefrontal cortex via cingulate fascicule in macaque monkeys Ventral posterior cingulate cortex was found to be reciprocally connected with the caudal part of the posterior parietal lobe in rhesus monkeys. Also the medial posterior parietal cortex is connected with posterior ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus.

===Other connections===
The anterior cingulate is connected to the posterior cingulate at least in rabbits. Posterior cingulate gyrus is connected with retrosplenial cortex and this connection is part of the dorsal splenium of the corpus callosum. The anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus and retrosplenial cortex send projections to subiculum and presubiculum.

==Clinical significance ==

=== Schizophrenia ===

Using a three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging procedure to measure the volume of the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus (perigenual cingulate gyrus), Takahashi et al. (2003) found that the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus is larger in control (healthy) females than males, but this sex difference was not found in people with schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia also had a smaller volume of perigenual cingulate gyrus than control subjects.

Haznedar et al. (2004) studied metabolic rate of glucose in anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus in people with schizophrenia, schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) and compared them with a control group. The metabolic rate of glucose was found to be lower in the left anterior cingulate gyrus and the right posterior cingulate gyrus in people with schizophrenia relative to controls. Although people with SPD were expected to show a glucose metabolic rate somewhere between the individual with schizophrenia and controls, they actually had higher metabolic glucose rate in the left posterior cingulate gyrus. The volume of the left anterior cingulate gyrus was reduced in people with schizophrenia as compared with controls, but there was not any difference between people with SPD and people with schizophrenia. From these results it appears that the schizophrenia and SPD are two different disorders.

A study of the volume of the gray and white matter in the anterior cingulate gyrus in people with schizophrenia and their healthy first and second degree relatives revealed no significant difference in the volume of the white matter in the people with schizophrenia and their healthy relatives. Nonetheless a significant difference in the volume of gray matter was detected, people with schizophrenia had smaller volume of gray matter than their second degree relatives, but not relative to their first degree relatives. Both the person with schizophrenia and their first degree healthy relatives have smaller gray matter volume than the second degree healthy relatives. It appears that genes are responsible for the decreased volume of gray matter in people with schizophrenia.
Fujiwara et al. (2007) did an experiment in which they correlated the size of anterior cingulate gyrus in people with schizophrenia with their functioning on social cognition, psychopathology and emotions with control group. The smaller the size of anterior cingulate gyrus, the lower was the level of social functioning and the higher was the psychopathology in the people with schizophrenia. The anterior cingulate gyrus was found to be bilaterally smaller in people with schizophrenia as compared with control group. No difference in IQ tests and basic visuoperceptual ability with facial stimuli was found between people with schizophrenia and the control.

==== Summary ====
People with schizophrenia have differences in the anterior cingulate gyrus when compared with controls. The anterior cingulate gyrus was found to be smaller in people with schizophrenia. The volume of the gray matter in the anterior cingulate gyrus was found to be lower in people with schizophrenia. Healthy females have larger rostral anterior cingulate gyrus than males, this sex difference in size is absent in people with schizophrenia. The metabolic rate of glucose was lower in the left anterior cingulate gyrus and in the right posterior cingulate gyrus.

In addition to changes in the cingulate cortex more brain structures show changes in people with schizophrenia as compared to controls. The hippocampus in people with schizophrenia was found to be smaller in size when compared with controls of the same age group, and, similarly, the caudate and putamen were found to be smaller in volume in a longitudinal study of people with schizophrenia. While the volume of gray matter is smaller, the size of the lateral and third ventricles is larger in people with schizophrenia.

=== Depression ===
The cingulate gyrus is heavily implicated in depressive disorders. The subgenual region, which lies below the genu of the corpus callosum, is especially important. This site is the target of deep-brain stimulation therapy for depression, an invasive therapy used when all other treatment methods have failed.

Isolated stroke of the cingulate gyrus has also been found to induce depression, potentially implicating this region in post-stroke depression which may occur following stroke of a larger part of the brain.

=== Age-related cognitive impairment ===
The cingulate cortex plays a key role in cognitive aging, particularly in the cingulo-opercular.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41598-024-83696-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Greater connectivity in the cingulo-opercular network is linked to better episodic memory, attention, and executive function, but declines with age, impacting cognitive performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.3389/fnagi.2020.00177&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;10.1093/cercor/bhu012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex within the salience network correlates with cognitive decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1162/jocn_a_00269&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Age-related decreases in cingulo-opercular connectivity, especially in the left insula, mediate declines in visual processing speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2018.09.014&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Its predictive value in aging models highlights its potential as a biomarker for cognitive decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41598-024-83696-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&quot;Cingulum&quot; means &quot;belt&quot; in Latin. The name was likely chosen because this cortex, in great part, surrounds the corpus callosum. 
The cingulate cortex is a part of the &quot;grand lobe limbique&quot; of Broca (1878) that consisted of a superior cingulate part (supracallosal) and an inferior hippocampic part (infracallosal). The limbic lobe was separated from the remainder of the cortex by Broca for two reasons: first because it is not convoluted, and second because the gyri are directed parasagittally (contrary to the transverse gyrification). Since the parasagittal gyrification is observed in non-primate species, the limbic lobe was thus declared to be &quot;bestial&quot;. As with other parts of the cortex, there have been and continue to be discrepancies concerning boundaries and naming. Brodmann (1909) further distinguished Areas 24 (anterior cingulate) and 23 (posterior) based on granularity. More recently, it was included as a part of the limbic lobe in the Terminologia Anatomica (1998) following von Economo&#x27;s (1925) system.

<text>Barbara Huddleston Abney-Hastings, 13th Countess of Loudoun (3 July 19191 November 2002), was a Scottish countess in her own right, and a member of the House of Lords. Lady Loudoun was the oldest daughter of Reginald Mowbray Chichester Huddleston and Edith Abney-Hastings, 12th Countess of Loudoun. Her father took her mother&#x27;s last name. Her only brother, Ian Huddleston Abney-Hastings, styled Lord Mauchline (1918–1944), was killed in Italy in World War II, so as the eldest sister, Barbara succeeded to the earldom in 1960.

Lady Loudoun was a member of the House of Lords until 1999, when the right of hereditary peers to sit in the Lords was abolished. She sat as a cross-bencher, and was concerned with social justice. She lived in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire.

==Ancestry==
On her mother&#x27;s side, she was descended from and heir-general of George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence. Her other notable ancestors include Mary Tudor, Queen of France; King James IV of Scotland; William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley; and Alice Spencer, Countess of Derby.

==Marriages and children==
Lady Loudoun married three times. She married, firstly, Captain Walter Strickland Lord on 5 September 1939. They had one child:
* Michael Abney-Hastings, 14th Earl of Loudoun (1942–2012)
Her second marriage was on 21 November 1945 to Captain Gilbert Frederick Greenwood. They had two children:
* Lady Selina Mary Abney-Hastings (b. 1946)
* Hon. Frederick James Abney-Hastings (b. 1949)
Her third and final marriage was to Peter Griffiths on 15 September 1954. They had three children:
* Lady Margaret Maud Abney-Hastings (b. 1956)
* Lady Mary Joy Abney-Hastings (b. 1957)
* Lady Clare Louise Abney-Hastings (b. 1958)

On her death, she was succeeded by her oldest son.

<text>Water Stratford is a village and civil parish on the River Great Ouse in Buckinghamshire, England. It is about west of Buckingham, near the boundary with Oxfordshire.

==Manor==
The toponym &quot;Stratford&quot; is common in England, being derived from the Old English for &quot;ford by a Roman road&quot;. The Roman road is still traceable through the village. The prefix &quot;Water&quot; was added to differentiate the village from other places called Stratford. The name has evolved through the centuries from &quot;Stradford&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, through &quot;Stratforwe&quot;, &quot;Straford&quot; and &quot;Westratforde&quot; in the 13th to 15th centuries.

The earliest known record of Water Stratford is from the time of Edward the Confessor (reigned 1042–66). After the Norman conquest of England Water Stratford was one of many manors in the region that William of Normandy granted to Robert D&#x27;Oyly, who built Oxford Castle. The Domesday Book of 1086 assessed Water Stratford&#x27;s cultivated land at eight hides. Water Stratford remained in the D&#x27;Oyly family until the 13th century, when it passed from Henry D&#x27;Oyly to his nephew Thomas de Beaumont, 6th Earl of Warwick. The Earl died heirless, leaving his sister Margaret, by whose marriage Water Stratford then passed to the du Plessis family. Late in the 13th century Hugh du Plessis seems to have granted Water Stratford to Edward I in an exchange of lands. The manor was then the property of successive Princes of Wales until the English Civil War in the middle of the 17th century. No record of the feudal overlordship is known from after 1650.

The present manor house bears a date stone inscribed with the year 1598. The upper flight of the staircase has early 17th century pierced balusters. Other details were added to the house in the 20th century.

The Domesday Book records that by 1086 Water Stratford had a watermill, presumably on the River Great Ouse. It is recorded again in 1278–79, but it was destroyed in 1349 by Isabel de Stratford, widow of a Lord of the Manor of Water Stratford.

==Parish church==
The Church of England parish church of Saint Giles was built in the 12th century. The south doorway is Norman and has a finely carved tympanum of Christ in Majesty. The chancel arch and one lancet window on either side in the chancel are 13th century. The tower was built in the 14th century and some Decorated Gothic and Perpendicular Gothic windows were added over the centuries. The tower was reduced in height in the 18th century. The church was almost entirely rebuilt in 1828, but unusually for that period its original features were preserved and replaced apparently &quot;in situ&quot;. The tower has three bells. St. Giles&#x27; is a Grade I listed building.

==Notable people==
John Mason (1645–94) was parish priest of St. Giles. He was a Puritan, admired by fellow-clergy including Richard Baxter. Mason wrote more than 30 hymns, including the still popular Anglican hymn &quot;How shall I sing that majesty&quot;.

In the last years of his life Mason&#x27;s mental health deteriorated. From 1690 he preached that the Second Coming of Christ was imminent. He claimed he was the prophet Elijah and that he would be raised from the dead three days after his death. From 1693 hundreds of followers flocked to Water Stratford, where they lived in barns or camped in a field awaiting the Second Coming. Mason died on 22 May 1694. His followers&#x27; belief was so strong that his successor as parish priest had Mason&#x27;s corpse exhumed to disprove his claim of resurrection. Still some of Mason&#x27;s followers refused to leave, and stayed at Water Stratford awaiting his resurrection for up to 15 years when they were dispersed by the local militia.

Joseph Bosworth (1788–1876), scholar of Old English, author of the first Anglo-Saxon dictionary, and Professor of Anglo-Saxon at the University of Oxford from 1858 to 1876, was parish priest of St. Giles from 1858.

More recent former residents are Paul Daniels, magician, Peter Woodthorpe, actor, and Yana (singer), (real name Pamela Guard).

<doc id="419580" wikidata="Q3161138" url="?curid=419580" title="James Harrison (engineer)">
<text>James Harrison (17 April 1816 – 3 September 1893) was a Scottish Australian newspaper printer, journalist, politician, and pioneer in the field of mechanical refrigeration.

Harrison founded the &quot;Geelong Advertiser&quot; newspaper and was a member of the Victorian Legislative Council and Victorian Legislative Assembly. Harrison is also remembered as the inventor of the mechanical refrigeration process creating ice and founder of the Victorian Ice Works and as a result, is often called &quot;the father of refrigeration&quot;. In 1873 he won a gold medal at the Melbourne Exhibition by proving that meat kept frozen for months remained perfectly edible.

==Early life==
James Harrison was born at Bonhill, Dunbartonshire, the son of a fisherman. Harrison attended Anderson&#x27;s University and then the Glasgow Mechanics&#x27; Institution, specialising in chemistry. He trained as a printing apprentice in Glasgow and worked in London as a compositor before emigrating to Sydney, Australia in 1837 to set up a printing press for the English company Tegg &amp; Co. Moving to Melbourne in 1839 he found employment with John Pascoe Fawkner as a compositor and later editor on Fawkner&#x27;s &quot;Port Phillip Patriot&quot;. When Fawkner acquired a new press, Harrison offered him 30 pounds for the original old press to start Geelong&#x27;s first newspaper. The first weekly edition of the &quot;Geelong Advertiser&quot; appeared November 1840: edited by &#x27;James Harrison and printed and published for John Pascoe Fawkner (sole proprietor) by William Watkins...&#x27;. By November 1842, Harrison became sole owner.

==Political career==
Harrison was a member of Geelong&#x27;s first town council in 1850 and represented Geelong in the Victorian Legislative Council from November 1854 until its abolition in March 1856. Harrison then represented Geelong 1858–59 and Geelong West 1859–60 in the Victorian Legislative Assembly.

As an editor he was an early advocate for tariff protection which later he brought to prominence when he was editor of &quot;The Age&quot; under the proprietorship of David Syme. But his rise ceased abruptly in 1854 after a controversial libel suit was brought against him by the Crown Prosecutor George Mackay whose evident drunkenness on duty Harrison had editorially deplored. The jury brought in a verdict for Mackay with Harrison to pay £800 damages. In 1862, although his assets were worth £22,000, he had to sell the &quot;Advertiser&quot; to escape bankruptcy.

It was while he owned this paper from 1842 to 1862 that his interest in refrigeration and ice-making began to develop. Whilst cleaning movable type with ether, he noticed that the evaporating fluid would leave the metal type cold to the touch.

== Ice-making operation and later life ==

Harrison&#x27;s first mechanical ice-making machine began operation in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in Geelong.

Because of the cost of importing ice from the United States and Norway for use in ice houses, Harrison&#x27;s device became a financially viable alternative for the remote Victoria colony, and his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1854, along with a patent for an ether refrigeration system granted in 1855. This novel system used a compressor to force the refrigeration gas to pass through a condenser, where it cooled down and liquefied. The liquefied gas then circulated through the refrigeration coils and vaporised again, cooling down the surrounding system. The machine employed a 5 m (16 ft.) flywheel and produced of ice per day. In 1856 Harrison went to London where he patented both his process (747 of 1856) and his apparatus (2362 of 1857).

Also in 1856, James Harrison, was commissioned by a brewery to build a machine that could cool beer. His system was almost immediately taken up by the brewing industry and was also widely used by meatpacking factories.

Though Harrison had commercial success establishing a second ice company back in Sydney in 1860, he later entered the debate of how to compete against the American advantage of unrefrigerated beef sales to the United Kingdom. He wrote &quot;Fresh Meat frozen and packed as if for a voyage, so that the refrigerating process may be continued for any required period&quot;, and in 1873 prepared the sailing ship &quot;Norfolk&quot; for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom. His choice of a cold room system instead of installing a refrigeration system upon the ship itself proved disastrous when the ice was consumed faster than expected. The experiment failed, ruining public confidence in refrigerated meat at that time. He returned to journalism, becoming editor of the Melbourne &quot;Age&quot; in 1867.

Harrison returned to Geelong in 1892 and died at his Point Henry home in 1893.

==Legacy==

The James Harrison Museum committee have acquired land at Rocky Point (the site of the first ice-making machine in the world) and are endeavouring to build a museum there.

The Australian Institute of Refrigeration Air Conditioning and Heating&#x27;s most distinguished award is the James Harrison Medal.

The James Harrison bridge spanning the Barwon River in Geelong is named in his honour.

A plaque located at 100 Franklin St, Melbourne commemorates the Victoria Ice Works founded by James Harrison in 1859.

The centenary of refrigeration (1856-1956) was commemorated with a plaque in Ryrie Street, Geelong Advertiser Building.

<doc id="419581" wikidata="Q4251089" url="?curid=419581" title="John Campbell, 1st Earl of Loudoun">
<text>John Campbell, 1st [[Earl of Loudoun]] (1598 – March 1662) was a Scottish politician and Covenanter.

As a young man Campbell travelled abroad. In 1620 married the heiress of the barony of Loudoun; in his wife&#x27;s right, took his seat in the Parliament of Scotland. In 1622 his patent for an earldom stopped by Charles I because of his strenuous opposition to episcopacy. In 1633 he took a leading part in organising the Covenant, 1637–1638. He was a leader of the armed insurrection in Scotland in 1639 and an envoy from Scotland to Charles I in 1640. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London but was freed and joined the Scottish army of invasion in August 1640. He was sent again as an envoy to London and was made Lord Chancellor of Scotland from 1641 to 1660. In 1641 he was also created Earl of Loudoun. During the years 1642–1647 he was frequently envoy to Charles I from the Parliament of Scotland. In 1650 he was present at the coronation of Charles II of Scotland and fought at Dunbar. He joined the Highland rising of 1653, but submitted to General Monck when it became obvious that further resistance was futile. He was excepted from Cromwell&#x27;s Act of Grace in 1654 and heavily fined by Charles II in 1662.

==Biography==
Campbell, was the eldest son of Sir James Campbell of Lawers, and his wife, Jean, daughter of James, Lord Colville of Culross. He was born in 1598, and on his return from travelling abroad was knighted by James VI of Scotland.

In 1620 Campbell married Margaret, the eldest daughter of George Campbell, master of Loudoun. Upon the death of her grandfather, Hugh Campbell, 1st Baron Loudoun, in December 1622, she became baroness Loudoun, and her husband took his seat in the Parliament of Scotland in her right. He was created Earl of Loudoun, lord Farrinyeane and Mauchline by patent dated at Theobalds on 12 May 1633, but in consequence of his joining with the George Leslie, Earl of Rothes and others in parliament in their opposition to the court with regard to the act for empowering King Charles I to prescribe the apparel of churchmen, the patent was by a special order stopped at the chancery, and the title superseded. Soon after the passing of this act, the Scottish bishops resumed their episcopal costume, and in 1636 the Book of Canons Ecclesiastical and the order for using the new service-book were issued upon the sole authority of the King without consulting the general assembly. By his opposition to the policy of the court, Loudoun became a favourite of the adherents of the popular cause; and on 21 December 1637, at the meeting of the Privy Council at Dalkeith, in an eloquent speech, he detailed the grievances of the &quot;Supplicants&quot;, and presented a petition on their behalf.

In 1638 the &quot;tables&quot; were formed and the covenant renewed. In these proceedings Loudoun took a very prominent part, and being elected elder for the Burgh of Irvine in the general assembly, which met at Glasgow in November 1638, he was appointed one of the assessors to the Moderator. In the following year, with the assistance of his friends, he seized the castles of Strathaven, Douglas, and Tantallon, and garrisoned them for the popular party. He marched with the Scottish army, under General Leslie, to the border, and acted as one of the Scottish commissioners at the short-lived Pacification of Berwick, which was concluded on 18 June 1639.

On 3 March 1640 Loudoun and the Charles Seton, Earl of Dunfermline, as commissioners from the estates, had an interview with Charles I at Whitehall, and remonstrated against the prorogation of the Parliament of Scotland by the king&#x27;s commissioner (John, Earl of Traquair) before the business which had been brought before them had been disposed of. No answer was given to the remonstrance, but a few days after Loudoun was committed to the Tower of London upon acknowledging that a letter produced by the Earl of Traquair was in his own handwriting. This letter was addressed &quot;Au Roy&quot;, and requested assistance from the French king. It was signed by the Earls of Montrose, Rothes, and Mar, Lords Loudoun, Montgomery, and Forester, and General Leslie, but was not dated. Loudoun protested without avail that it had been written before the pacification of Berwick, that it had never been sent, and that if he had committed any offence, he ought to be questioned for it in Scotland and not in England. According to Dr. Birch, a warrant was made out for Loudoun&#x27;s execution without trial, but this has not been sufficiently corroborated, and after some months&#x27; confinement in the Tower he was liberated upon the intercession of James, Marquis of Hamilton, and returned to Scotland.

On 21 August in the same year the Scottish army entered England, and Loudoun with it. He took part in the Battle of Newburn on 28 August, and was one of the Scottish commissioners at Ripon in the following October. Having come to an agreement for the cessation of hostilities on the 25th of the same month, the further discussion of the treaty was adjourned to London, where the Scottish commissioners &quot;were highly caressed by the parliament&quot;.

In August 1641 the King opened the Parliament of Scotland in person, the treaty with England was ratified, and offices and titles of honour were conferred on the &quot;prime covenanters who were thought most capable to do him service&quot;. Accordingly, &quot;the principal manager of the rebellion&quot;, as Clarendon calls him, was appointed Lord Chancellor of Scotland on 30 September 1641, and on 2 October took the oath of office, and received from the King the Great Seal, which, since the resignation of John Spottiswoode, the Archbishop of St. Andrews, had been kept by the Marquis of Hamilton. A pension of £1,000 a year was also granted him, and his title of Earl of Loudoun was allowed him, with precedency from the date of the original grant. When the king found that the estates would not give their consent to the nomination either of the Earl of Morton or of Lord Almond, as lord high treasurer, the treasury was put into commission, and Loudoun appointed the first commissioner.

In 1642 Loudoun was sent by the conservators of the peace to offer mediation between the king and the English parliament. He had several conferences with Charles at York, but, failing in the object of his mission, returned to Scotland. After the outbreak of the Civil War, Loudoun was sent to Oxford as one of the commission to mediate for peace. Charles, however, would not admit that the act of pacification gave the Scottish council any authority to mediate, and refused to allow the commissioners to proceed to London for that purpose. In 1643 Loudoun was again chosen elder for the burgh of Irvine to the general assembly, but this time declined the nomination. In the same year he was with the other Scottish commissioners invited to attend the discussions of the assembly of divines at Westminster. In 1645 he was appointed one of the Scottish commissioners to the treaty of Uxbridge, and though he did his best to convince Charles I of the impolicy of holding out any further against the parliamentary demands, his efforts were unavailing. At Newcastle he again unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Charles, then virtually a prisoner of the Scottish army. In 1647 Loudoun, with the Earls of Lauderdale and Lanark, was sent to treat with Charles at Carisbrooke Castle where they entered into the &quot;Engagement&quot; with Charles. On his return from England he was chosen president of the parliament which met on 2 March 1648. Persuaded by the more violent party of the Covenanters, who denounced the &quot;Engagement&quot; as &quot;an unlawful confederacy with the enemies of God&quot;, he changed sides and opposed the measure. He was, however, obliged to do public penance in the High Church of Edinburgh for the part which he had originally taken. When Montrose was brought to the bar to receive sentence, Loudoun commented with severity upon his conduct. As Lord Chancellor he assisted at the coronation of Charles II at Scone on 1 January 1650, and was present at the Battle of Dunbar, where some of his letters to Charles II fell into Cromwell&#x27;s hands. These letters were afterwards published by the order of the English Parliament.

After the Battle of Worcester (September 1651) Loudoun retired into the highlands, and in 1653 joined William, Earl of Glencairn and other Cavaliers who had risen in the King&#x27;s favour. Divisions arising among the leaders, Loudoun left them and retired further north. He at length surrendered to General George Monck, whose brilliant success had demonstrated the uselessness of further resistance on the part of the Royalists. Loudoun and his eldest son, Lord Mauchline, were both excepted out of Cromwell&#x27;s act of indemnity, by which £400 was settled on the Countess Loudoun and her heirs out of her husband&#x27;s estates. Upon the Restoration, notwithstanding all that Loudoun had suffered for the royal cause, he was deprived of the chancellorship, which had been granted to him &quot;ad vitam aut culpam&quot;; his pension, however, was still continued to him.

In the first session of parliament in 1661 he spoke strongly in defence of his friend, the Archibald Campbell, Marquess of Argyll, who was then under an impeachment for high treason. Argyll was executed, and Loudoun became apprehensive lest he too might share the same fate. In the following year, by an act &quot;containing some exceptions from the Act of Indemnite&quot;, he was fined £12,000 (Scottish pounds). He died at Edinburgh on 15 March 1663, and was buried in the Loudoun Kirk, in what is now East Ayrshire.

Several of his speeches were printed in the form of pamphlets, and will be found among the political tracts in the British Museum.

==Family==
With his wife, Margaret, who survived him, Loudoun had two sons and two daughters. His eldest son, James, succeeded to the title, and died at Leyden. On the death of James, the fifth earl (a grandson of the second earl), the title descended to his only daughter, Flora, who married Francis, 2nd Earl of Moira, afterwards 1st Marquis of Hastings. Upon the death of Henry, 4th Marquis of Hastings, in 1868, his eldest sister Edith became the Countess of Loudoun, and the title passed to her son Charles, 11th Earl of Loudoun.

<text>The Hethumids ( Hethumian) (also spelled Hetoumids or Het&#x27;umids), also known as the House of Lampron (after Lampron castle), were an Armenian dynasty and the rulers of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia from 1226 to 1341. Hethum I, the first of the Hethumids, came to power when he married Queen Isabella of Armenia who had inherited the throne from her father.

== History ==
The Hethumid dynasty was established when Constantine&#x27;s grandson, Hethum I, was appointed as the ruler of Cilicia by the Mongol Empire. Hethum I expanded the kingdom&#x27;s territory and forged close ties with the Mongol Empire, which allowed him to maintain autonomy and protection from external threats.

Under the Hethumids, the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia reached its cultural and economic peak. The dynasty was known for its support of the arts, literature, and architecture, which led to the construction of magnificent buildings and the creation of beautiful artworks. The Hethumid rulers also maintained alliances with the Crusaders and other European powers, which brought significant economic and political benefits to the kingdom.

However, the kingdom&#x27;s fortunes began to decline in the 14th century, and it eventually fell to the Mamluk Sultanate in 1375. Despite its ultimate demise, the Hethumid dynasty left a lasting legacy in Armenian history and culture.

==Hethumid Kings of Armenia==
* Hethum (or Hetoum) I (1226–1270)
* Leo II (1270–1289) – son of Hethum I
* Hethum II (1289–1293) – son of Leo II

<text>Wavendon is a village and civil parish in the south east of the Milton Keynes urban area, in Buckinghamshire, England.

==History and geography==
The village name is an Old English language word, and means &#x27;Wafa&#x27;s hill&#x27;. In the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; in 969 the village was recorded as &quot;Wafandun&quot;. The ancient village lies just outside the 1967 designated area of Milton Keynes. The ecclesiastic parish of Wavendon anciently contained the hamlet of Woburn Sands (originally known as &#x27;Hogsty End, Wavendon&#x27;), which became a separate civil parish in 1907. The parishes are separated by the Marston Vale line.

===Wavendon Tower===

Wavendon Tower is a large country house with substantial modern additions on the edge of the village. During the Second World War it was used as a recording studio for black propaganda. From 1969 to the late 1970s, it was the base for the Milton Keynes Development Corporation. Until 2011 it was an operating centre for Scicon (subsequently EDS). In 2012, Landar Limited, an automotive management consultancy, moved into Wavendon Tower.

==Expansion plans for Milton Keynes==
In the 2004 expansion plans for Milton Keynes, it was proposed that Wavendon would become a neighbourhood centre of the city, in a similar way to the other towns and villages that provided the roots of early Milton Keynes districts. However, following the 2010 general election, the new Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition government cancelled the expansion plans of the outgoing Labour government. Subsequent development has occurred in a piecemeal fashion.

In 2012, Milton Keynes Borough Council approved parish council proposals for development near the village.

Since the 2011 National Census, the Office for National Statistics has shown Wavendon as part of the Milton Keynes built-up area.

===Magna Park===
Magna Park is a large distribution site on the part of Wavendon civil parish north of the A421 (and in the &#x27;Eastern Expansion Area&#x27;, one element of the expansion plans for Milton Keynes that has gone ahead). In 2012 its occupants included John Lewis and River Island, both of which have very large distribution centres. , AG Barr, Amazon, H&amp;M and Waitrose have joined them. The site is at the south-east edge of Milton Keynes, with the A421 connecting it to Bedford and the M1 via Junction 13 (about ) to the east, and the rest of Milton Keynes, Buckingham and the A5 to the west.

===Housing developments===
Following an increase in housing demand in the Milton Keynes urban area, the Wavendon civil parish has undergone major development, including the construction of two new estates (Eagle Farm and Glebe Farm) on its eastern outskirts. Milton Keynes City Council regards this part of the parish as a major part of Milton Keynes&#x27; &quot;Eastern Expansion Area.&quot;

==The Stables==

Jazz artists John Dankworth and Cleo Laine shared a home in Wavendon from the late 1960s. The couple founded &quot;The Stables&quot; as a live venue in 1970 in what was the old stables block in the grounds of their home. It was an immediate success with forty-seven concerts given in the first year.

The venue was completely rebuilt in 2000, with a subsequent development in 2007 to create Stage 2. Each year, the venue presents over 350 concerts and around 250 education events in its two auditoria including summer schools; the 400 seat Jim Marshall Auditorium, and smaller studio space at Stage 2. Dame Cleo Laine continues to live in the village.

<doc id="419589" wikidata="Q2121931" url="?curid=419589" title="Anterior cingulate cortex">
<text>In the human brain, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is the frontal part of the cingulate cortex that resembles a &quot;collar&quot; surrounding the frontal part of the corpus callosum. It consists of Brodmann areas 24, 32, and 33.

It is involved in certain higher-level functions, such as attention allocation, reward anticipation, decision-making, impulse control (e.g. performance monitoring and error detection), and emotion.

Some research calls it the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC). 

==Anatomy==

The anterior cingulate cortex can be divided anatomically based on cognitive (dorsal), and emotional (ventral) components. The dorsal part of the ACC is connected with the prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex, as well as the motor system and the frontal eye fields, making it a central station for processing top-down and bottom-up stimuli and assigning appropriate control to other areas in the brain. By contrast, the ventral part of the ACC is connected with the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and anterior insula, and is involved in assessing the salience of emotion and motivational information. The ACC seems to be especially involved when effort is needed to carry out a task, such as in early learning and problem-solving.

On a cellular level, the ACC is unique in its abundance of specialized neurons called spindle cells, or von Economo neurons. These cells are a relatively recent occurrence in evolutionary terms (found only in humans and other primates, cetaceans, and elephants) and contribute to this brain region&#x27;s emphasis on addressing difficult problems, as well as the pathologies related to the ACC.

==Tasks==
A typical task that activates the ACC involves eliciting some form of conflict within the participant that can potentially result in an error. One such task is called the Eriksen flanker task and consists of an arrow pointing to the left or right, which is flanked by two distractor arrows creating either compatible (««&lt;) or incompatible (»&lt;») trials. Another very common conflict-inducing stimulus that activates the ACC is the Stroop task, which involves naming the color ink of words that are either congruent ( written in red) or incongruent ( written in blue). Conflict occurs because people&#x27;s reading abilities interfere with their attempt to correctly name the word&#x27;s ink color. A variation of this task is the &quot;Counting-Stroop&quot;, during which people count either neutral stimuli (&#x27;dog&#x27; presented four times) or interfering stimuli (&#x27;three&#x27; presented four times) by pressing a button. Another version of the &quot;Stroop task&quot; named the &quot;Emotional Counting Stroop&quot; is identical to the &quot;Counting Stroop&quot; test, except that it also uses segmented or repeated emotional words such as &quot;murder&quot; during the interference part of the task. Thus, ACC affects decision making of a task.

==Functions==
Many studies attribute specific functions such as error detection, anticipation of tasks, attention, motivation, and modulation of emotional responses to the ACC.

===Error detection and conflict monitoring===
The most basic form of ACC theory states that the ACC is involved with error detection. Evidence has been derived from studies involving a Stroop task. However, ACC is also active during correct response, and this has been shown using a letter task, whereby participants had to respond to the letter X after an A was presented and ignore all other letter combinations with some letters more competitive than others. They found that for more competitive stimuli ACC activation was greater.

A similar theory poses that the ACC&#x27;s primary function is the monitoring of conflict. In Eriksen flanker task, incompatible trials produce the most conflict and the most activation by the ACC. Upon detection of a conflict, the ACC then provides cues to other areas in the brain to cope with the conflicting control systems.

==== Evidence from electrical studies ====
Evidence for ACC as having an error detection function comes from observations of error-related negativity (ERN) uniquely generated within the ACC upon error occurrences. A distinction has been made between an ERP following incorrect responses (response ERN) and a signal after subjects receive feedback after erroneous responses (feedback ERN).

Patients with lateral prefrontal cingulate (PFC) damage show reduced ERNs.

Reinforcement learning ERN theory poses that there is a mismatch between actual response execution and appropriate response execution, which results in an ERN discharge. Furthermore, this theory predicts that, when the ACC receives conflicting input from control areas in the brain, it determines and allocates which area should be given control over the motor system. Varying levels of dopamine are believed to influence the optimization of this filter system by providing expectations about the outcomes of an event. The ERN, then, serves as a beacon to highlight the violation of an expectation. Research on the occurrence of the feedback ERN shows evidence that this potential has larger amplitudes when violations of expectancy are large. In other words, if an event is not likely to happen, the feedback ERN will be larger if no error is detected. Other studies have examined whether the ERN is elicited by varying the cost of an error and the evaluation of a response.

In these trials, feedback is given about whether the participant has gained or lost money after a response. Amplitudes of ERN responses with small gains and small losses were similar. No ERN was elicited for any losses as opposed to an ERN for no wins, even though both outcomes are the same. The finding in this paradigm suggests that monitoring for wins and losses is based on the relative expected gains and losses. If you get a different outcome than expected, the ERN will be larger than for expected outcomes. ERN studies have also localized specific functions of the ACC.

The rostral ACC seems to be active after an error commission, indicating an error response function, whereas the dorsal ACC is active after both an error and feedback, suggesting a more evaluative function (for fMRI evidence, see also ). This evaluation is emotional in nature and highlights the amount of distress associated with a certain error. Summarizing the evidence found by ERN studies, it appears to be the case that ACC receives information about a stimulus, selects an appropriate response, monitors the action, and adapts behavior if there is a violation of expectancy.

=== Social evaluation ===
Activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been implicated in processing both the detection and appraisal of social processes, including social exclusion. When exposed to repeated personal social evaluative tasks, non-depressed women showed reduced fMRI BOLD activation in the dACC on the second exposure, while women with a history of depression exhibited enhanced BOLD activation. This differential activity may reflect enhanced rumination about social evaluation or enhanced arousal associated with repeated social evaluation.

The anterior cingulate cortex gyrus is involved in effort to help others.

===Reward-based learning theory===
A more comprehensive and recent theory describes the ACC as a more active component and poses that it detects and monitors errors, evaluates the degree of the error, and then suggests an appropriate form of action to be implemented by the motor system. Earlier evidence from electrical studies indicate the ACC has an evaluative component, which is indeed confirmed by fMRI studies.
The dorsal and rostral areas of the ACC both seem to be affected by rewards and losses associated with errors. During one study, participants received monetary rewards and losses for correct and incorrect responses, respectively.

Largest activation in the dACC was shown during loss trials. This stimulus did not elicit any errors, and, thus, error detection and monitoring theories cannot fully explain why this ACC activation would occur. The dorsal part of the ACC seems to play a key role in reward-based decision-making and learning. The rostral part of the ACC, on the other hand, is believed to be involved more with affective responses to errors. In an interesting expansion of the previously described experiment, the effects of rewards and costs on ACC&#x27;s activation during error commission was examined. Participants performed a version of the Eriksen flanker task using a set of letters assigned to each response button instead of arrows.

Targets were flanked by either a congruent or an incongruent set of letters. Using an image of a thumb (up, down, or neutral), participants received feedback on how much money they gained or lost. The researchers found greater rostral ACC activation when participants lost money during the trials. The participants reported being frustrated when making mistakes. Because the ACC is intricately involved with error detection and affective responses, it may very well be that this area forms the basis of self-confidence. Taken together, these findings indicate that both the dorsal and rostral areas are involved in evaluating the extent of the error and optimizing subsequent responses. A study confirming this notion explored the functions of both the dorsal and rostral areas of the ACC involved using a saccade task.

Participants were shown a cue that indicated whether they had to make either a pro-saccade or an anti-saccade. An anti-saccade requires suppression of a distracting cue because the target appears in the opposite location causing the conflict. Results showed differing activation for the rostral and dorsal ACC areas. Early correct anti-saccade performance was associated with rostral activation. The dorsal area, on the other hand, was activated when errors were committed, but also for correct responses.

Whenever the dorsal area was active, fewer errors were committed providing more evidence that the ACC is involved with effortful performance. The second finding showed that, during error trials, the ACC activated later than for correct responses, clearly indicating a kind of evaluative function.

===Role in consciousness===
The ACC area in the brain is associated with many functions that are correlated with conscious experience. Greater ACC activation levels were present in more emotionally aware female participants when shown short &#x27;emotional&#x27; video clips. Better emotional awareness is associated with improved recognition of emotional cues or targets, which is reflected by ACC activation.

The idea of awareness being associated with the ACC is supported by some evidence, in that it seems to be the case that, when subjects&#x27; responses are not congruent with actual responses, a larger error-related negativity is produced.

One study found an ERN even when subjects were not aware of their error. Awareness may not be necessary to elicit an ERN, but it could influence the effect of the amplitude of the feedback ERN. Relating to the reward-based learning theory, awareness could modulate expectancy violations. Increased awareness could result in decreased violations of expectancies and decreased awareness could achieve the opposite effect. Further research is needed to completely understand the effects of awareness on ACC activation.

In &quot;The Astonishing Hypothesis&quot;, Francis Crick identifies the anterior cingulate, to be specific the anterior cingulate sulcus, as a likely candidate for the center of free will in humans. Crick bases this suggestion on scans of patients with specific lesions that seem to interfere with their sense of independent will, such as alien hand syndrome.

===Role in registering pain===
The ACC registers physical pain as shown in functional MRI studies that showed an increase in signal intensity, typically in the posterior part of area 24 of the ACC, that was correlated with pain intensity. When this pain-related activation was accompanied by attention-demanding cognitive tasks (verbal fluency), the attention-demanding tasks increased signal intensity in a region of the ACC anterior and/or superior to the pain-related activation region. The ACC is the cortical area that has been most frequently linked to the experience of pain. It appears to be involved in the emotional reaction to pain rather than to the perception of pain itself.

Evidence from social neuroscience studies have suggested that, in addition to its role in physical pain, the ACC may also be involved in monitoring painful social situations as well, such as exclusion or rejection. When participants felt socially excluded in an fMRI virtual ball throwing game in which the ball was never thrown to the participant, the ACC showed activation. Further, this activation was correlated with a self-reported measure of social distress, indicating that the ACC may be involved in the detection and monitoring of social situations which may cause social/emotional pain, rather than just physical pain.

==Pathology==
Studying the effects of damage to the ACC provides insights into the type of functions it serves in the intact brain. Behavior that is associated with lesions in the ACC includes: inability to detect errors, severe difficulty with resolving stimulus conflict in a Stroop task, emotional instability, inattention, and akinetic mutism. There is evidence that damage to ACC is present in patients with schizophrenia, where studies have shown patients have difficulty in dealing with conflicting spatial locations in a Stroop-like task and having abnormal ERNs. Participants with ADHD were found to have reduced activation in the dorsal area of the ACC when performing the Stroop task. Together, these findings corroborate results from imaging and electrical studies about the variety of functions attributed to the ACC.

===OCD===
There is strong evidence that this area may have a role in obsessive–compulsive disorder. A recent study from the University of Cambridge showed that participants with OCD had higher levels of glutamate and lower levels of GABA in the anterior cingulate cortex, compared to participants without OCD. They used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission by measuring glutamate and GABA levels in anterior cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area of healthy volunteers and participants with OCD. Participants with OCD had significantly higher levels of glutamate and lower levels of GABA in the ACC and a higher Glu:GABA ratio in that region.

Recent SDM meta-analyses of voxel-based morphometry studies comparing people with OCD and healthy controls has found people with OCD to have increased grey matter volumes in bilateral lenticular nuclei, extending to the caudate nuclei, while decreased grey matter volumes in bilateral dorsal medial frontal/anterior cingulate cortex. These findings contrast with those in people with other anxiety disorders, who evince decreased (rather than increased) grey matter volumes in bilateral lenticular / caudate nuclei, while also decreased grey matter volumes in bilateral dorsal medial frontal / anterior cingulate gyri.

===Anxiety===
The ACC has been suggested to have possible links with social anxiety, along with the amygdala part of the brain, but this research is still in its early stages. A more recent study, by the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Centre, confirms the relationship between the ACC and anxiety regulation, by revealing mindfulness practice as a meditator for anxiety precisely through the ACC.

===Depression===
The adjacent subcallosal cingulate gyrus has been implicated in major depression and research indicates that deep-brain stimulation of the region could act to alleviate depressive symptoms. Although people with depression had smaller subgenual ACCs, their ACCs were more active when adjusted for size. This correlates well with increased subgenual ACC activity during sadness in healthy people, and normalization of activity after successful treatment. Of note, the activity of the subgenual cingulate cortex correlates with individual differences in negative affect during the baseline resting state; in other words, the greater the subgenual activity, the greater the negative affectivity in temperament.

===Lead exposure===
A study of brain MRIs taken on adults that had previously participated in the Cincinnati Lead Study found that people that had higher levels of lead exposure as children had decreased brain size as adults. This effect was most pronounced in the ACC (Cecil et al., 2008) and is thought to relate to the cognitive and behavioral deficits of affected individuals.

===Autism===
Impairments in the development of the anterior cingulate, together with impairments in the dorsal medial-frontal cortex, may constitute a neural substrate for socio-cognitive deficits in autism, such as social orienting and joint attention.

===PTSD===
An increasing number of studies are investigating the role of the ACC in post-traumatic stress disorder. PTSD diagnosis and related symptoms such as skin conductance response (SCR) to &quot;potentially startling sounds&quot; were found to be correlated with reduced ACC volume. Further, childhood trauma and executive dysfunction seem to correlate with reduced ACC connectivity to surrounding neural regions. In a longitudinal study, this reduced connectivity was able to predict high-risk drinking (binge drinking at least once per week for the past 12 months) up to four years later.

===General risk of psychopathology===
A study on differences in brain structure of adults with high and low levels of cognitive-attentional syndrome demonstrated diminished volume of the dorsal part of the ACC in the former group, indicating relationship between cortical thickness of ACC and general risk of psychopathology.

<text>Woburn Sands () is a town that straddles the border between Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire in England, and is part of the Milton Keynes urban area. The larger part of the town is in Woburn Sands civil parish, which is in the City of Milton Keynes, Smaller parts of the town are in the neighbouring parishes of Aspley Guise and Aspley Heath (in Central Bedfordshire). The meandering boundary between Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire means the Lower and Middle Schools that serve all of the town are both in Aspley Guise CP. Bedfordshire Police and Thames Valley Police both deal with law enforcement issues in the town. At the 2011 Census, the population of the civil parish (only) was 2,916, that of the built-up area (including much of Aspley Guise) was 5,959. Woburn Sands, Aspley Guise and Aspley Heath each has its own centre but together the three settlements are a contiguous built-up area.

==History==
The earliest evidence of settlement is an Iron Age hill fort dating from around 500 BC, called Danesborough Camp which is located to the southwest of the present town. Later when the settlement had developed into a hamlet, it was part of the parish of Wavendon, becoming a separate civil parish in 1907. Under the Local Government Act 1972 the parish council has adopted the status of a town in its own right. It has separated from Wavendon parish which is just to the north of the Marston Vale line.

The village name was originally Hogsty End, one of Wavendon&#x27;s four &#x27;ends&#x27; (along with Church End, Cross End and Lower End) but by Victorian times, this un-picturesque name had fallen out of favour, and Woburn Sands had taken over as the accepted name. The modern name is credited to a schoolmaster unable to attract business to his &quot;Hogsty End Academy&quot;, and was one of the first to promote the use of the new name. The modern place name is related to nearby Woburn in Bedfordshire, and to the sandy local soil resulting from its proximity to the Greensand Ridge, an escarpment of Greensand that is part of the Woburn Sands Formation.

==Transport==
===Rail===
The town, alongside Wavendon and the surrounding areas of south-east Milton Keynes, is served by Woburn Sands railway station. The station is on the Marston Vale line, three closely placed stops east of Bletchley railway station, a junction station with the West Coast Main Line. Inter-city services can be accessed via , roughly north-west of the town.

===Road===
The town is bisected by the former A5130, which forms part of a continuous route between the A5 at Hockliffe and the A509/A4146 near Broughton, and is close to Junction 13 of the M1 motorway, about east of the town, accessed via local roads.

===Bus===
The town is served by two bus services: South Beds Dial-a-Ride bus 47 to Tingrith and Leighton Buzzard, and Britannia bus 450 to Central Milton Keynes.

Milton Keynes City Council also operates an on demand bus service known as &quot;MK Connect&quot;, which serves the whole Milton Keynes unitary authority area, including most of Woburn Sands, which predominantly lies under the jurisdiction of said City Council.

==Media==
Local television news programmes are &quot;BBC Look East&quot; and &quot;ITV News Anglia&quot;, &quot;BBC South Today&quot; and &quot;ITV News Meridian&quot; can also be received. Local radio stations are BBC Three Counties Radio on 104.5 FM, Heart East on 103.3 FM, and MKFM, a community based station which broadcast from Milton Keynes. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Milton Keynes Citizen&quot;.

==Governance==
Woburn Sands CP has been part of the Borough (now City) of Milton Keynes since 1974, which has been a unitary authority since 1997. This gives Milton Keynes City Council the responsibility for the provision of most local government services. Voters registered in the parish are represented on Milton Keynes City Council, which has (since 2014) been divided into 19 wards each carrying 3 councillors with Woburn Sands CP being part of the Danesborough and Walton ward. At the parish level, Woburn Sands CP has a town council which is based at Ellen Pettit Memorial Hall on the town&#x27;s high street.

The remainder of the town (within the CPs of Aspley Guise and Aspley Heath) has formed part of Central Bedfordshire (also a unitary authority) since 2009, and is part of the Aspley and Woburn ward for elections to Central Bedfordshire Council, which provides most local government services for this area.

<text>Weedon is a village and civil parish north of Aylesbury and south of Hardwick in the Aylesbury Vale district of Buckinghamshire, England. The toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;hill with a heathen temple&quot;. In records dated 1066 the village was recorded as &quot;Weodune&quot;.

Weedon has a Methodist Chapel and a pub called the Five Elms. To the east of the village is the hamlet of East End.

Portions of the village (and later parish) have been subject to human settlement since the early Bronze Age, with excavations in the early 2000s suggesting that a field system was in operation, and later Roman settlement has also been identified. Some Neolithic flint working has been recovered but there is no indication of anything more than low-level activity.

Some historical sources note that Weedon (and Weedon Hill) are closely associated with the Battle of Aylesbury, although current opinion is divided as to the significance of that incident.

== Housing development==
Prior to 2011 land within the parish southwest of the village and adjoining the northern edge of Aylesbury was designated a &#x27;major development area called Weedon Hill. When completed the housing development will include 850 houses, a local centre and a secondary school.

Additionally, an extension of the Chiltern Line was constructed which included a new station, opened in 2008, called Aylesbury Vale Parkway. In 2010 the district council decided that from May 2011 the Weedon Hill development would form part of the new civil parish of Buckingham Park.

The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin was designed by the Oxford Diocesan architect G.E. Street and built in 1867. It is a Grade II* listed building.

In the 20th century Westcott was the site of the Rocket Propulsion Establishment, which was on the former RAF Westcott airfield to the west of the main village. This has since been closed down, and the area is called the Westcott Venture Park. BAE Systems maintains a presence on the site (BAE Systems Environmental) which advises on the decommissioning of military sites.

G.E. Street also designed the parish school. It is now Westcott Church of England School, a mixed primary school. In 2012 it gained permission to expand the age range of its children, taking them from 4–11 years old, with an integrated pre-school nursery that caters to children of 3 for half days.

<text>A Brodmann area is a region of the cerebral cortex, in the human or other primate brain, defined by its cytoarchitecture, or histological structure and organization of cells. The concept was first introduced by the German anatomist Korbinian Brodmann in the early 20th century. Brodmann mapped the human brain based on the varied cellular structure across the cortex and identified 52 distinct regions, which he numbered 1 to 52. These regions, or Brodmann areas, correspond with diverse functions including sensation, motor control, and cognition.

==History==
Brodmann areas were originally defined and numbered by the German anatomist Korbinian Brodmann based on the cytoarchitectural organization of neurons he observed in the cerebral cortex using the Nissl method of cell staining. Brodmann published his maps of cortical areas in humans, monkeys, and other species in 1909, along with many other findings and observations regarding the general cell types and laminar organization of the mammalian cortex. The same Brodmann area number in different species does not necessarily indicate homologous areas. A similar, but more detailed cortical map was published by Constantin von Economo and Georg N. Koskinas in 1925.

==Present importance==
Brodmann areas have been discussed, debated, refined, and renamed exhaustively for nearly a century and remain the most widely known and frequently cited cytoarchitectural organization of the human cortex.

Many of the areas Brodmann defined based solely on their neuronal organization have since been correlated closely to diverse cortical functions. For example, Brodmann areas 1, 2 and 3 are the primary somatosensory cortex; area 4 is the primary motor cortex; area 17 is the primary visual cortex; and areas 41 and 42 correspond closely to primary auditory cortex. Higher order functions of the association cortical areas are also consistently localized to the same Brodmann areas by neurophysiological, functional imaging, and other methods (e.g., the consistent localization of Broca&#x27;s speech and language area to the left Brodmann areas 44 and 45). However, functional imaging can only identify the approximate localization of brain activations in terms of Brodmann areas since their actual boundaries in any individual brain require its histological examination.

==Overview==
Different parts of the cerebral cortex are involved in different cognitive and behavioral functions. The differences show up in a number of ways: the effects of localized brain damage, regional activity patterns exposed when the brain is examined using functional imaging techniques, connectivity with subcortical areas, and regional differences in the cellular architecture of the cortex. Neuroscientists describe most of the cortex—the part they call the neocortex—as having six layers, but not all layers are apparent in all areas, and even when a layer is present, its thickness and cellular organization may vary. Scientists have constructed maps of cortical areas on the basis of variations in the appearance of the layers as seen with a microscope. One of the most widely used schemes came from Korbinian Brodmann, who split the cortex into 52 different areas and assigned each a number (many of these Brodmann areas have since been subdivided). For example, Brodmann area 1 is the primary somatosensory cortex, Brodmann area 17 is the primary visual cortex, and Brodmann area 25 is the anterior cingulate cortex.

Many of the brain areas defined by Brodmann have their own complex internal structures. In a number of cases, brain areas are organized into topographic maps, where adjoining bits of the cortex correspond to adjoining parts of the body, or of some more abstract entity. A simple example of this type of correspondence is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue running along the anterior edge of the central sulcus. Motor areas innervating each part of the body arise from a distinct zone, with neighboring body parts represented by neighboring zones. Electrical stimulation of the cortex at any point causes a muscle-contraction in the represented body part. This &quot;somatotopic&quot; representation is not evenly distributed, however; the head, for example, is represented by a region about three times as large as the zone for the entire back and trunk. The size of any zone correlates to the precision of motor control and sensory discrimination possible. The areas for the lips, fingers, and tongue are particularly large, considering the proportional size of their represented body parts.

The maps for visual areas are retinotopic, meaning that they reflect the topography of the retina: the layer of light-activated neurons lining the back of the eye. In this case too, the representation is uneven: the fovea—the area at the center of the visual field—is greatly overrepresented compared to the periphery. The visual circuitry in the human cerebral cortex contains several dozen distinct retinotopic maps, each devoted to analyzing the visual input stream in a particular way. The primary visual cortex (Brodmann area 17), which is the main recipient of direct input from the visual part of the thalamus, contains many neurons that are most easily activated by edges with a particular orientation moving across a particular point in the visual field. Visual areas farther downstream extract features such as color, motion, and shape.

In auditory areas, the primary map is tonotopic. Sounds are parsed according to frequency (i.e., high pitch vs. low pitch) by subcortical auditory areas, and this parsing is reflected by the primary auditory zone of the cortex. As with the visual system, there are a number of tonotopic cortical maps, each devoted to analyzing sound in a particular way.

Within a topographic map there can sometimes be finer levels of spatial structure. In the primary visual cortex, for example, where the main organization is retinotopic and the main responses are to moving edges, cells that respond to different edge-orientations are spatially segregated from one another.

==Criticism==
When von Bonin and Bailey constructed a brain map for the macaque monkey, they found the description of Brodmann inadequate and wrote: &quot;Brodmann (1907), it is true, prepared a map of the human brain which has been widely reproduced, but, unfortunately, the data on which it was based was never published&quot; They instead used the cytoarchitectonic scheme of Constantin von Economo and Georg N. Koskinas published in 1925 which had the &quot;only acceptable detailed description of the human cortex&quot;.

<text>The family Talpidae () includes the true moles (as well as the shrew moles and desmans) who are small insectivorous mammals of the order Eulipotyphla. Talpids are all digging animals to various degrees: moles are completely subterranean animals; shrew moles and shrew-like moles somewhat less so; and desmans, while basically aquatic, excavate dry sleeping chambers; whilst the quite unique star-nosed mole is equally adept in the water and underground. Talpids are found across the Northern Hemisphere of Eurasia and North America (although none are found in Ireland nor in the Americas south of northern Mexico), and range as far south as the montane regions of tropical Southeast Asia.

The first talpids evolved from shrew-like animals which adapted to digging late in the Eocene in Europe. &quot;Eotalpa anglica&quot; is the oldest known mole, it was discovered in the Late Eocene deposits of Hampshire Basin, UK. The most primitive living talpids are believed to be the shrew-like moles, with other species having adapted further into the subterranean, and, in some cases, aquatic lifestyles.

==Characteristics==
Talpids are small, dark-furred animals with cylindrical bodies and hairless, tubular snouts. They range in size from the tiny shrew moles of North America, as small as 10 cm in length and weighing under 12 grams, to the Russian desman, with a body length of 18–22 cm, and a weight of about 550 grams. The fur varies between species, but is always dense and short; desmans have waterproof undercoats and oily guard hairs, while the subterranean moles have short, velvety fur lacking any guard hairs. The forelimbs of moles are highly adapted for digging, with powerful claws, and the paws turned permanently outwards to aid in shovelling dirt away from the front of the body. By contrast, desmans have webbed paws with a fringe of stiff fur to aid in swimming. Moles generally have short tails, but those of desmans are elongated and flattened.

All species have small eyes and poor eyesight, but only a few are truly blind. The external ears are very small or absent. Talpids rely primarily on their sense of touch, having sensory vibrissae on their faces, legs, and tails. Their flexible snouts are particularly sensitive. Desmans are able to close both their nostrils and ears while diving. Unusually, the penis of talpids points backwards, and they have no scrotum.

Females have six or eight teats. Both sexes have claws on all five fingers and on all five toes. The paw has an additional bone called the os falciforme. In burrowing moles, the clavicle and the humeral head are connected. The tibia and the fibula are partially fused in all talpids. The pubis does not connect the two halves of the pelvic girdle. The skull is long, narrow, and rather flattened.

Talpids are generally insectivorous. Moles eat earthworms, insect larvae, and occasionally slugs, while desmans eat aquatic invertebrates such as shrimps, insect larvae, and snails. Talpids have relatively unspecialized teeth, with the dental formula: 
===Sex characteristics===

===Behavior===

Desmans and shrew moles are primarily nocturnal, but moles are active day and night, usually travelling above ground only under cover of darkness. Most moles dig permanent burrows, and subsist largely on prey that falls into them. The shrew moles dig burrows to access deep sleeping chambers, but forage for food on the forest floor by night. Desmans dig burrows in riverbanks for shelter and forage in the water of rivers and lakes. The star-nosed mole is able to make a living much as other moles do, but are also very capable aquatic creatures, where they are able to smell underwater by using their unique proboscis to hold out a bubble of air into the water.

Talpids appear to be generally quite antisocial animals, and although at least one species, the star-nosed mole, will share burrows, talpids are known to engage in much territorial behavior, including extraordinarily fast battles.

Some studies suggest that this classification into three subfamilies is not entirely accurate, finding Uropsilinae to be the most basal member, then Desmanini, then a clade comprising Neurotrichini, Scaptonychini, and Urotrichini, then the Condylurini, and then Talpini and Scalopini being sister groups to one another. The current classification into 3 subfamilies renders both Talpinae and Scalopinae paraphyletic.

=== Unrelated mammals built like moles ===
The following mammals have burrowing habits, and have by virtue of convergent evolution many derived characters in common with true moles from the family Talpidae but are nonetheless unrelated.
* Marsupial moles (2 species): &quot;Notoryctes typhlops&quot;, and &quot;N. caurinus&quot;.
* Golden moles (21 species), belonging to the Afrotheria.

==Relationship with humans==
All species in the family Talpidae are classed as &quot;prohibited new organisms&quot; under New Zealand&#x27;s Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, preventing them from being imported into the country.

<text>Weston Turville is a historic village and civil parish in the Vale of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, England. The village is at the foot of the Chiltern Hills, 3 miles (4.9 km) from the market town of Wendover and 3.5 miles (5.7 km) from Aylesbury. In 2011 the parish had a population of 3127.

The village name &#x27;Weston&#x27; is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;western estate&#x27; or western homestead, as &#x27;tun&#x27; means an enclosed farm in Angle. In the Domesday Book of 1086, the village is recorded as &quot;Westone&quot;. The suffix &#x27;Turville&#x27; was added later, referring to the lords of the manor in the 13th century, and to differentiate the village from other places called Weston. Between 1236 and 1539, Weston Turville grew to have five areas, or ends – Church End, Brook End, South End, West End and World&#x27;s End. These five ends still exist, as documented by Hamish Eaton&#x27;s book &quot;Weston Turville – A History&quot;, published in 1997.

The 13th century church of St. Mary the Virgin is the parish church for Weston Turville and is a grade I listed building. A church has existed on the land at the end of Church Walk since the 12th century; however, all that remains of the original church is the font and an octagonal shaft built into the south wall of the chancel.

The nearest railway station is 1.8 miles (2.9 km) away in the village of Stoke Mandeville on the London to Aylesbury Line, operated by Chiltern Railways. Weekday buses serving Weston Turville run between Aylesbury and RAF Halton, and are operated by Arriva and Redline. Additionally, a service connects to both Aylesbury and Leighton Buzzard on Sundays.
Weston Turville has a small bird reserve, which was established by BBONT (Bucks, Beds and Oxford Nature Trust), now BBOWT (Berks, Bucks &amp; Oxon Wildlife Trust). The site had one hide and can be accessed from the main reservoir footpath. 
Weston Turville was at one time, one of the main places where Aylesbury ducks were bred. In the 18th century selective breeding of white common ducks led to a white domestic duck, generally known as the English White. Since at least the 1690s ducks had been farmed in Aylesbury, and Weston Turville went on to become one of the main areas where these ducks were bred. They were bred and brought up by poor people, and sent to London by the weekly carriers. 

A notable resident of the village in the 16th century was Dr John Colet. It is after him that the John Colet School in nearby Wendover is named. At one time, the UK TV presenter and Radio DJ Noel Edmonds had a home in Weston Turville. Currently former Arsenal defender Nigel Winterburn and Richard Lapthorne, Chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless Communications, live in the village.

Other notable features include:
* The hamlet of Bye Green is located to the north of the village, on the Brook End (road) leading to Aston Clinton.
* Weston Turville Golf Club was established in 1973. The 18-hole golf course is situated at the foot of the Chiltern Hills and off the white tees measures 6,008 yards and a par 69 and for the red ladies tees measures 5,369 yards and is a par 70. 
* There are many historic buildings with listed status in Weston Turville and much of the village was designated a conservation area in 1991. 
* Weston Turville Church of England School is a mixed voluntary aided primary school, which takes children from the age of four through to the age of eleven. The school has approximately 210 pupils.
* Weston Turville Reservoir built in 1797.
* The Manor House, site of a motte and twin baileys, the remains of the scheduled monument Weston Turville Castle.
* A local weather station with climatological history of the village.
* Weston Turville has a well-known audio library, Calibre Audio Library, which opened in 1974. It is located next to the Holiday Inn Hotel.

<doc id="419602" wikidata="Q5991023" url="?curid=419602" title="Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet">
<text>Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet, (23 May 181022 October 1855) was a Radical British politician, who served in the coalition cabinet of The Earl of Aberdeen from 1853 until his death in 1855 as First Commissioner of Works and then Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Much later, when justifying to the Queen his own new appointments, Gladstone told her: &quot;For instance, even in Ld Aberdeen&#x27;s Govt, in 52, Sir William Molesworth had been selected, at that time, a very advanced Radical, but who was perfectly harmless, &amp; took little, or no part... He said these people generally became very moderate, when they were in office&quot;, which she admitted had been the case.

==Background==
Molesworth was born in London and succeeded to the baronetcy in 1823. He was educated privately before entering St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge as a fellow commoner. Moving to Trinity College, he fought a duel with his tutor, and was sent down from the university. He also studied abroad and at Edinburgh University for some time. Molesworth was a member of the London Electrical Society.

==Political career==
On the passing of the Reform Act 1832 Molesworth was returned to Parliament for the Eastern division of Cornwall, to support the ministry of Lord Grey. Through Charles Buller he made the acquaintance of George Grote and James Mill, and in April 1835 he founded, in conjunction with Roebuck, the &quot;London Review&quot;, as an organ of the Philosophic Radicals. After the publication of two volumes he purchased the &quot;Westminster Review&quot;, and for some time the united magazines were edited by him and John Stuart Mill. Buller and Molesworth were associated with Edward Gibbon Wakefield and his schemes for colonising South Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

From 1837 to 1841 Molesworth sat for Leeds, and acquired considerable influence in the House of Commons by his speeches and by his tact in presiding over the select committee on penal transportation. But his Radicalism made little impression either on the house or on his constituency. In 1839 he commenced and carried to completion, at a cost of £6,000, a reprint of the entire miscellaneous and voluminous writings of Thomas Hobbes, which were placed in most of the English university and provincial libraries. The publication did him great disservice in public life, his opponents endeavouring to identify him with the freethinking opinions of Hobbes in religion as well as with the philosopher&#x27;s conclusions in favour of despotic government. From 1841 to 1845 he had no seat in parliament, but in 1842 served as High Sheriff of Cornwall.

In 1845 Molesworth was returned for Southwark, and retained that seat until his death. On his return to parliament he devoted special attention to the condition of the colonies, and was the ardent champion of their self-government. In January 1853, Lord Aberdeen included him as the only Radical in his coalition cabinet as First Commissioner of Works, the chief work by which his name was brought into prominence at this time being the construction of the new Westminster Bridge; he also was the first to open Kew Gardens on Sundays. In July 1855, he was made Colonial Secretary, an office he held until his death in October of the same year.

==Personal life==
It is known that Molesworth collected, paraphrased and published many of the works of Thomas Hobbes between 1839 and 1845 in the eleven volumes of &quot;The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury; Now First Collected and Edited by Sir William Molesworth, Bart.&quot; Those works included of the &quot;Iliad&quot;.

Molesworth became engaged in June and married Andalusia Grant Carstairs on 9 July 1844. She had been a singer and was not from a noble family. Molesworth&#x27;s family were opposed to the match.

He died on 22 October 1855, aged 45. He had no children, and the baronetcy passed to a cousin. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London, on the north side of the main path leading from the entrance to the central chapel.

The philanthropist John Passmore Edwards installed a likeness of Sir William Molesworth as a memorial medallion in the Borough Road public library in Southwark as a mark of appreciation such that, &quot;In so doing, we gratefully remember illustrious and useful lives into whose labours we have entered, and keep before us examples worthy of admiration.&quot;

The parish of Molesworth in Victoria, Australia, is named after Sir William.

<text>Dawn Primarolo, Baroness Primarolo, (born 2 May 1954) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament for Bristol South from 1987 until 2015, when she stood down. She was Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families at the Department for Children, Schools and Families from June 2009 to May 2010 and a Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons from 2010 to 2015. She was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2014 Birthday Honours for political service. She was nominated for a life peerage in the 2015 Dissolution Honours.

==Early life and career==
Born in London, Primarolo was raised in Crawley, West Sussex, where she attended Thomas Bennett comprehensive school. She then studied at Bristol Polytechnic as a bookkeeper and legal secretary. Returning to London, in 1973 she joined the Labour Party whilst employed as a legal secretary in an east London Law Centre.

After marrying, she moved back to Bristol to raise her son. She then studied for a social science degree at Bristol Polytechnic, where she gained a BA (Hons). Whilst working, she then continued her studies at the University of Bristol, where she registered for a PhD research into women and housing. She did not finish the PhD, but was awarded an honorary doctorate by the university in 2016.

Becoming involved in her local community, Primarolo belonged to various women&#x27;s groups and was active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, a founder member of Windmill Hill City Farm, and a school governor.

Active in her local Labour Party, in 1985 she was elected to Avon County Council, where she acted as vice chair of the Equal Opportunities Committee.

==Parliamentary career==
Primarolo was first elected to Parliament at the 1987 general election, after the constituency party de-selected Michael Cocks, the sitting MP. She gained national attention in January 1989 by asking Margaret Thatcher at Prime Minister&#x27;s Question Time if the only hope for low-paid women was &quot;to follow her example and find themselves a wealthy husband&quot;. She was reading out a question on behalf of Ann Clwyd, who at the time had &quot;lost her voice&quot;. Thatcher dismissed the question as &#x27;cheap&#x27;. She served as opposition spokesperson for health from 1992 to 1994 and the Treasury from 1994 to 1997.

At the time she was first elected, Primarolo was considered to be on the hard left, but later became a New Labour loyalist, leading Andrew Roth of &quot;The Guardian&quot; to say she has &quot;changed from &#x27;Red Dawn&#x27; to &#x27;Rosy Pink&#x27;&quot;; As part of this change, she shifted from support for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), the rise of which originally led her into politics, to voting for the renewal of Britain&#x27;s Trident nuclear deterrent.

Despite campaigning against the first Gulf War in 1991, she voted in favour of the Iraq War in 2003, and against any investigation into the invasion after it had taken place. On other &#x27;key issues&#x27; (as described by TheyWorkForYou), she has voted in favour of ID cards and increased university tuition fees.

Primarolo served as Financial Secretary to the Treasury from 1997 to 1999 and as Paymaster General from 1999 to 2007. As Paymaster General, Primarolo was responsible for the administration of the working tax credit system, which was a system that contributed to raising millions of children out of poverty. However, the administration of this system received some criticism, including allegations that some families were left less well off as a result. In 2003, a Treasury select committee member accused her of &quot;losing control of [her] department&quot; after it became known that Inland Revenue buildings under Primarolo&#x27;s purview had been sold to tax-haven companies. This came shortly after she had &quot;insisted ... the Child tax credit scheme was a &#x27;success&#x27;&quot;, despite Inland Revenue staff walking out in protest against the pressure under which they were placed. She was also responsible for introducing the controversial IR35 tax rules which were designed to tax &quot;disguised employment&quot; at a rate similar to employment. The measure was controversial as it was seen by some as unfair. Primarolo was also the longest serving Paymaster General in the office&#x27;s 200-year history. Primarolo was named Chairman of the Code of Conduct Group upon its establishment by ECOFIN in March 1998.

In 2005, PM Tony Blair was forced to apologise after a report by the Parliamentary Ombudsman that Primarolo had failed to give Parliament accurate information. Primarolo admitted at the same time that she had been fully aware &quot;about the extent of the problems&quot;.

As Minister of State for Public Health from 2007 to 2009, Primarolo was responsible for health improvement and health protection issues including such areas as tobacco, obesity, drugs and sexual health, as well as international business, pharmacy and research and development.

On 5 June 2009 Primarolo was moved, this time succeeding Beverley Hughes as Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families at the Department for Children, Schools and Families. This gave her the right to attend cabinet when her responsibilities were on the agenda.

Primarolo&#x27;s abilities as a minister have been questioned, with former Prime Minister Tony Blair revealing in his autobiography &quot;A Journey&quot; that he did not think she was &quot;right for government&quot; but had to give her a job because she was one of Gordon Brown&#x27;s key allies; and political commentator Danny Finkelstein arguing that she was &quot;contender no. 1&quot; for title of &quot;Labour&#x27;s worst Minister&quot;. Jonathan Powell, Blair&#x27;s Chief of Staff, is reported as saying &quot;We fired Dawn Primarolo about ten times. And each time Gordon (Brown) insisted we put her back.&quot;

===Deputy Speaker===
Primarolo joined the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Minister for Children when Labour entered opposition in May 2010. In June 2010 she became a Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. In November 2011 she announced her intention to stand down from Parliament at the next general election.

Primarolo was created a life peer taking the title Baroness Primarolo, of Windmill Hill in the City of Bristol on 26 October 2015.

=== 2022 Infected Blood Inquiry ===
In July 2022 Primarolo provided written evidence to the Infected Blood Inquiry. In September 2022 she provided spoken evidence.

==Personal life==
Primarolo married UNISON regional secretary Ian Ducat in Bristol in 1990.

<text>Weston Underwood is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. It is located about a mile west of Olney.

The village name &#x27;Weston&#x27; is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;western estate&#x27;, possibly referring to the situation of the village in relation to Olney. The affix &#x27;Underwood&#x27; refers to the village&#x27;s location to a nearby forest, probably the Yardley Chase and Whittlewood Forest.

==Notable residents==
A notable resident of the village for many years was William Cowper.

<text>Korbinian Brodmann (17 November 1868 – 22 August 1918) was a German neuropsychiatrist who is known for mapping the cerebral cortex and defining 52 distinct regions, known as Brodmann areas, based on their cytoarchitectonic (histological) characteristics.

== Life and career ==
Brodmann was born in Liggersdorf, Province of Hohenzollern, Kingdom of Prussia. He studied medicine in Munich, Würzburg, Berlin, and Freiburg, where he received his medical diploma in 1895. Subsequently he studied at the Medical School in the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, and then worked in the University Clinic in Munich. He received a doctor of medicine degree from the University of Leipzig in 1898, with a thesis on chronic ependymal sclerosis. From 1900 to 1901, Brodmann also worked in the Psychiatric Clinic at the University of Jena, with Ludwig Binswanger, and in the Municipal Mental Asylum in Frankfurt. There, he met Alois Alzheimer, who was influential in his decision to pursue basic neuroscience research.

Following this, Brodmann started to work in 1901 with Cécile and Oskar Vogt at the private institute Neurobiologische Zentralstation in Berlin, and in 1902 in the Neurobiological Laboratory of the University of Berlin. In 1915 he joined the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Hirnforschung, now known as the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research.

In 1909, Brodmann published his original research on cortical cytoarchitectonics in the monograph &quot;&quot; (&quot;Localisation in the cerebral cortex&quot;). Famously, this book contained the first map of the cerebral cortex based on regional variations in structure. These regions would later become known as Brodmann areas.

After completing his work in Berlin, Brodmann joined the University of Tübingen. There, he was habilitated and made a full professor in 1913. From 1910 to 1916, he served as physician and chairman of the Anatomical Laboratory at the University Psychiatric Clinic. Brodmann moved to Halle in 1916 to work in the Nietleben Municipal Hospital. Finally, in 1918, he accepted an invitation from the University of Munich to direct the group of histology at Psychiatric Research Center.

Brodmann died in Munich rather suddenly of a generalized septic infection following pneumonia, at just under 50 years of age on 22 August 1918.

== Brodmann areas ==

The cortical areas that Brodmann described and located are now usually referred to as Brodmann areas. There are a total of 52 areas grouped into 11 histological areas. Brodmann used a variety of criteria to map the human brain, including attention to both gross anatomical features and cortical micro-structures. Brodmann postulated that areas with different structures performed different functions. Indeed, some of these areas were later associated to nervous functions, such as the following:
* Brodmann area 41 and 42 in the temporal lobe, related to hearing
* Brodmann area 45 and 44 overlap with the Broca&#x27;s area for language in humans
* Brodmann area 1, 2, and 3 in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe (the somatosensory region)
* Brodmann area 4 in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe (the primary motor area)
* Brodmann area 17 and 18 in the occipital lobe (the primary visual areas).

His work to characterize brain cytoarchitecture was strongly influenced by Oskar Vogt, who postulated over 200 distinct areas in the brain. In modern science, the regions that were identified by Brodmann are frequently referred to by their function, rather than by the number Brodmann assigned to them. However, in some situations, the use of Brodmann numbers persists.

<text>Whaddon is a village and also a civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, within the Buckinghamshire Council unitary authority area. It is situated just outside of Bletchley, a constituent town of Milton Keynes.
The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;hill where wheat is grown&#x27;. The village is referred to several times in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; generally in the form of &quot;Hwætædun&quot;.

The village is at the centre of the ancient Whaddon Chase, the site for many centuries of royal hunting lands. Whaddon Chase is designated an area of &#x27;Special Landscape Interest&#x27;.

The Church of St Mary is a grade I listed building.

Whaddon Church of England School is a mixed Church of England primary school. It is a voluntary controlled school, which takes children from the age of four through to the age of eleven. The school has approximately 50 pupils.

Richard Cox (ca.1500 – 1581), an English clergyman, who was Dean of Westminster and Bishop of Ely, was born at Whaddon.

Whaddon Hall, the village manor, was once home to the Selby family (also known as Selby-Lowndes), whose ancestor William Lowndes (1652–1724) built the larger and grander Winslow Hall. Both mansions are still private houses. During the Second World War Whaddon Hall served as headquarters of Section VIII (Communications) of MI6, as an outpost of Bletchley Park.

<doc id="419614" wikidata="Q7431499" url="?curid=419614" title="Schism of the Three Chapters">
<text>The Schism of the Three Chapters was a schism that affected Chalcedonian Christianity in Northern Italy lasting from 553 to 698 AD and in some areas to 715 AD, although the area out of communion with Rome contracted during that time. It was part of a larger Three-Chapter Controversy that affected the whole of Roman-Byzantine Christianity.

==Background to the Three-Chapter Controversy==

The Three-Chapter Controversy arose from an attempt to reconcile the Non-Chalcedonian (Miaphysite) Christians of the Middle East with the positions of the Council of Chalcedon. To exact a compromise, works of several Eastern theologians such as Theodoret of Cyrus, Ibas of Edessa, and Theodore of Mopsuestia, which came to be known collectively as the &quot;Three Chapters&quot;, were condemned. The positions of the &quot;Three Chapters&quot; were particularly objectionable to the Miaphysites and, in an attempt to win them to the Council, the condemnation was issued.

The condemnation took the form of an Imperial Edict around 543, accompanied by the Tome of Pope Leo I that had been read at the Council of Chalcedon nearly one hundred years before. There was some resistance in the Greek speaking, eastern part of the Church, although in the end the leading Eastern bishops did agree to condemn it. Those who would not condemn these works were accused of being sympathetic to the heresy of Nestorianism.

==The original Break==
In 553 by council, the bishops of Aquileia, Liguria, Aemilia, Milan and of the Istrian peninsula all refused to condemn the Three Chapters, arguing that to do so would be to betray Chalcedon. They broke off communion with Rome, under the leadership of Macedonius of Aquileia (535–556).

They in turn were anathematized by other churchmen.

The schism provided the opportunity for the bishop of Aquileia to assume the title Patriarch. Macedonius&#x27; successor Paulinus I (557–569) began using the title around 560.

==The Lombard Invasion==

By the end of the next decade, the Lombards had overrun all of northern Italy.

In 568, the patriarch of Aquileia, Paulinus, was obliged to flee, with the treasures of his church, to the little island of Grado, near Trieste, a last remnant of the Eastern Roman Empire in northern Italy and eight miles to the south of Aquileia. This political change did not affect the relations of the patriarchate with the Apostolic See; its bishops, whether in Lombard or imperial territory, stubbornly refused all invitations to a reconciliation. The Synod of Grado in 579 confirmed this position.

With the exception of the patriarch of Aquileia, these bishops and most of their suffragans were now subjects of the Lombards and beyond the reach of the Byzantine Exarch at Ravenna. As a result, they were able to maintain their dissent in support of the schism.

==The Schism in Milan==

The Bishop of Milan was Dacius, who was at Constantinople at the time and strongly opposed the condemnation of the Three Chapters, going so far as to break off communion with Greek bishops who signed the condemnation. He died in Constantinople in 552 and took no direct part in the schism.

Bishop Honoratus of Milan fled the city when it was besieged by the Lombard Alboin in 568. Honoratus sought refuge in Byzantine-controlled Genoa with a great number of his clergy. At his death there was a split with the Milanese clergy at Genoa electing Laurentius II, and the Christians remaining in Milan electing Fronto. Laurence subscribed to the condemnation while Fronto observed the schism with Rome.

Communion between Milan and Rome was restored around 581.

==The Schism in Grado==

The seat of the Patriarch of Aquileia stayed in Byzantine controlled Grado. The Byzantines allowed these freedom and archbishop Elias, already called patriarch by his suffragans, built a cathedral under the patronage of St. Euphemia as an unabashed statement of his adherence to the schism since it was the church of St. Euphemia in which the sessions of the Council of Chalcedon were approved. Gregory the Great&#x27;s attempts at conciliation near the end of his pontificate, and especially through the Lombard queen, Theodelinda, began to have some effect.

Thus, in 606, Elias&#x27;s successor Severus died and there were many clerics favorable to reconciliation. The Byzantines encouraged these to elect Candidianus who once elected promptly restored communion. Those of his suffragans whose sees lay within the empire joined him in submission to the Apostolic See.

==The Split of the Patriarchate of Aquileia==
Many mainland bishops whose dioceses were under Lombard control were unhappy with the reconciliation. Many of them were Bishops of dioceses that were under Lombard control. These dissidents fled to mainland Aquileia and under Lombard protection elected a John as a rival patriarch who maintained the schism. There were now two patriarchates in northern Italy, Aquileia in Grado and Old-Aquileia.

The diocese of Como, originally suffragan of Milan, by the mid 6th century, in disagreement with the reconciliation of Milan, the diocese rejected the link with that city and passed to be subject to Aquileia, and remained until 1751, celebrating with the Aquileian Rite until 1597, one year after its abolition in Aquileia, when the Pope ordered the diocese of Como to abandon it, despite resistance.

==Reconciliation with Rome==

The schism had deepened along political, Lombard-Roman lines. The Irish missionary Columbanus, who was ministering to the Lombards in Bobbio was involved in the first attempt to resolve this division through mediation between 612 and 615. Agilulf, King of the Lombards, persuaded him to address a letter on the schism to Boniface IV. He tells the pope that he is suspect of heresy for accepting the Fifth Ecumenical Council (the Second Council of Constantinople in 553), and exhorts him to summon a council and prove his orthodoxy.

Historian Edward Gibbon theorized that Pope Honorius I reconciled the Patriarch to Rome in 638, although this did not last.

As the schism lost its vigour, the Lombards started to renounce Arianism and join western apostolic and catholic orthodoxy. The bishop of Old-Aquileia formally ended the schism at the Synod of Pavia in 698. After Old-Aquileia reconciled with Rome, Pope Gregory II granted the pallium to Patriarch Serenus (715–730) of Aquileia in 723. The division of the Patriarchate of Aquileia into the rival Patriarchies of Aquileia and Grado contributed to the evolution of the Patriarch of Grado into the present Patriarch of Venice.

<doc id="419615" wikidata="Q382292" url="?curid=419615" title="Power cord">
<text>A power cord, line cord, or mains cable is an electrical cable that temporarily connects an appliance to the mains electricity supply via a wall socket or extension cord. The terms are generally used for cables using a power plug to connect to a single-phase alternating current power source at the local line voltage (generally 100 to 240 volts, depending on the location). The terms [[power cable]], mains lead, flex or kettle lead are also used. A lamp cord (also known as a [[zip cord]]) is a light-weight, ungrounded, single-insulated two-wire cord used for small loads such as a table or floor lamp.

A cord set includes connectors molded to the cord at each end (see Appliance coupler). Cord sets are detachable from both the power supply and the electrical equipment, and consist of a flexible cord with electrical connectors at either end, one male, and one female. One end of the cord set is attached to a molded electrical plug; the other is typically a molded electrical receptacle to prevent the possibility of having an exposed live prong or pin which would cause electric shock. The female connector attaches to the piece of equipment or appliance while the male plug connects to the electrical receptacle or outlet.

==Features==
Power cables may be either fixed or detachable from the appliance. In the case of detachable leads, the appliance end of the power cord has a female connector to link it to the appliance, to avoid the dangers from having a live protruding pin. Cords may also have twist-locking features, or other attachments to prevent accidental disconnection at one or both ends. A cord set may include accessories such as fuses for overcurrent protection, a pilot lamp to indicate voltage is present, or a leakage current detector. Power cords for sensitive instruments, or audio/video equipment may also include a shield over the power conductors to minimize electromagnetic interference.

A power cord or appliance coupler may have a retaining clamp, a mechanical device that prevents it from inadvertently being pulled or shaken loose. Typical application areas with stricter safety requirements include medical technology, stage and lighting technology, and computing equipment. For specialty equipment such as construction machinery, sound and lighting equipment, emergency medical defibrillators and electrical power tools, used in locations without a convenient power source, extension cords are used to carry the electric current up to hundreds of feet away from an outlet.

In North America, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association develops standards for electrical plugs and receptacles and cables.

International power cords and plug adapters are used in conjunction with electrical appliances in countries different from those in which they were designed to operate. Besides a cord with one end compatible to receptacles or a device from one country and the other end compatible with receptacles or devices from another country, a voltage converter is usually necessary, as well, to protect travelers&#x27; electronic devices, such as laptops, from the differing voltages between the United States and places like Europe or Africa.

North American lamp cords have two single-insulated conductors designed for low-current applications. The insulator covering one of the conductors is ribbed (parallel to wire) for the entire length of the cord, while the other conductor&#x27;s insulator is smooth. The smooth one is hot and the ribbed one is neutral.

==Connectors==
IEC 60320 power cables come in normal and high-temperature variants, as well as various rated currents. The connectors have slightly different shapes to ensure that it is not possible to substitute a cable with a lower temperature or current rating, but that it &quot;is&quot; possible to use an overrated cable. Cords also have different types of exterior jackets available to accommodate environmental variables such as moisture, temperature, oils, sunlight, flexibility, and heavy wear. For example, a heating appliance may come with a cord designed to withstand accidental contact with heated surfaces.

Worldwide, more than a dozen different types of AC power plugs and sockets are used for fixed building wiring. Products sold in many different markets can use a standardized IEC 60320 connector and then use a detachable power cord to match the local electrical outlets. This simplifies safety approvals, factory testing, and production since the power cord is a low-cost item available as a commodity. Since the same types of appliance-side connectors are used with both 120 V and 230 V power cables, the user must ensure the connected equipment will operate with the available voltage. Some devices have a slide-switch to adapt to different voltages, or wide-ranging power supplies.

==Standards==
National electrical codes may apply to power cords and related items. For example, in the United States, power cords must meet UL Standards 62 and 817.

==Power supplies==
Cord sets must be distinguished from AC adapters, where the connector also contains a transformer, and possibly rectifiers, filters and regulators. Unwary substitution of a standard mains-voltage connector for the power supply would result in application of full line voltage to the connected device, resulting in its destruction and possible fire or personal injury.

<text>The Balboa Peninsula (also referred to as &quot;Balboa&quot; or &quot;the Peninsula&quot;) is a neighborhood of the city of Newport Beach, Orange County, California. It is named after Spanish explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa, the first European to sight the Pacific from the Americas.
Balboa is primarily residential with some commercial areas.

==History==

In 1888, the McFadden family, which had arrived in California c. 1849, decided their shipping business would be more successful if they moved it from the inner shores of the bay to the oceanfront, where it was connected by rail to Santa Ana. They built McFadden Wharf at the location where the Newport Pier is today. In 1899, the Federal Government allocated funds for major improvements to a new harbor at San Pedro, which would become Southern California&#x27;s major seaport. The McFadden Wharf and railroad were sold to the Southern Pacific Railroad that same year, signaling the end of Newport Bay as a commercial shipping center.

In 1902, James McFadden sold his Newport townsite and about half of the peninsula to William Collins, who saw Newport Bay&#x27;s resort and recreation potential. Collins took on Henry E. Huntington as a partner in the Newport Beach Company. Huntington had acquired the Pacific Electric railway system and used it to promote new communities outside of Los Angeles.

In 1905, the Pacific Electric Balboa Line was extended to Newport. Collins began dredging a channel on the north side of the bay and deposited the sand and silt on tidelands that would become Balboa Island. Newport Harbor was still largely undredged.

==Boundaries==
The peninsula acts as a jetty enclosing the Newport Harbor and Newport Beach&#x27;s eight islands. The Peninsula is connected from the land via Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1) at Balboa Boulevard, via Bridge at Newport Boulevard (SR 55) from SR 1 (and from Via Lido which connects via bridge to Lido Isle, via Bridge from Newport Island, via Bridge from Bay Isle and via Balboa Island Ferry from Balboa Boulevard and Palm Street to Balboa Island which is connected via bridge from Jamboree Road and SR 1. The west end of Balboa Island connects via bridge to Collins Isle and the east end connects via bridge over the Grand Canal to the Little Island. The center of the Peninsula is called Balboa Village and the end of the Peninsula is called Balboa Peninsula Point. Balboa Pier is near the Balboa Island Ferry in Balboa Village and about two miles toward SR 1 is Newport Pier at McFadden Square. Linda Isle and Harbor Island connect via bridge from Bayside Drive off SR 1.

<text>Bélapátfalva is a town in Heves County, in Hungary, located north of the city of Eger. The town is located inside the Eger river valley at an altitude of 311 meters above sea level. Facing the town is the Bél-kő mountain which rises 811 meters and is one of the highest peaks of the Bükk mountains. Because of the picturesque landscape and notable attraction the village is on the path of the National Blue Trail.

== Romanesque church of Bélapátfalva ==
The town is the site of the best-preserved Romanesque church building in Hungary, formerly part of a Cistercian abbey, established by Bishop Cletus Bél. The church was built after 1232 and later modified in Gothic style. The façade is notable for its Romanesque portal and the interplay between grey and reddish stone rows. The abbey to the south of the church was destroyed in the 16th century, and only its ruins remain. The design of the chapel of the Cistercian Our Lady of Dallas in Irving, Texas, was influenced by this church, which architect Gary Cunningham visited prior in preparation for the project.

<text>Wheeler End is a hamlet in the parish of Piddington and Wheeler End, in Buckinghamshire, England. The hamlet is located close to the main A40 between West Wycombe and Stokenchurch.

The hamlet name refers to the Wheeler family, who lived here. They were once the main brewers of High Wycombe. The hamlet itself however, is much older, dating back to the Anglo-Saxon period.

Wheeler End is a collection of terraced houses and free standing properties surrounding the village common. The Common and most of the arable land surrounding the properties in the hamlet are owned by the West Wycombe Estates of Sir Edward Dashwood, Bt. There are no shops in Wheeler End, the nearest shops being either in West Wycombe or in Lane End. There is one public house in Wheeler End, The Chequers Inn.

<doc id="419620" wikidata="Q1187984" url="?curid=419620" title="Semi-active radar homing">
<text>Semi-active radar homing (SARH) is a common type of missile guidance system, perhaps the most common type for longer-range air-to-air and surface-to-air missile systems. The name refers to the fact that the missile itself is only a passive detector of a radar signal—provided by an external (&quot;offboard&quot;) source—as it reflects off the target (in contrast to active radar homing, which uses an active radar transceiver). Semi-active missile systems use bistatic continuous-wave radar.

The NATO brevity code for a semi-active radar homing missile launch is [[Fox (code word)|Fox]] One.

==Concept==
The basic concept of SARH is that since almost all detection and tracking systems consist of a radar system, duplicating this hardware on the missile itself is redundant. The weight of a transmitter reduces the range of any flying object, so passive systems have greater reach. In addition, the resolution of a radar is strongly related to the physical size of the antenna, and in the small nose cone of a missile there isn&#x27;t enough room to provide the sort of accuracy needed for guidance. Instead the larger radar dish on the ground or launch aircraft will provide the needed signal and tracking logic, and the missile simply has to listen to the signal reflected from the target and point itself in the right direction. Additionally, the missile will listen rearward to the launch platform&#x27;s transmitted signal as a reference, enabling it to avoid some kinds of radar jamming distractions offered by the target.

The SARH system determines the closing velocity using the flight path geometry shown in Figure 1. The closing velocity is used to set the frequency location for the CW receive signal shown at the bottom of the diagram (spectrum). Antenna offset angle of the missile antenna is set after the target is acquired by the missile seeker using the spectrum location set using closing speed. The missile seeker antenna is a monopulse radar receiver that produces angle error measurements using that fixed position. Flight path is controlled by producing navigation input to the steering system (tail fins or gimbaled rocket) using angle errors produced by the antenna. This steers the body of the missile to hold the target near the centerline of the antenna while the antenna is held in a fixed position. The offset angle geometry is determined by flight dynamics using missile speed, target speed, and separation distance.

Techniques are nearly identical using jamming signals, optical guidance video, and infra-red radiation for homing.

Maximum range is increased in SARH systems using navigation data in the homing vehicle to increase the travel distance before antenna tracking is needed for terminal guidance. Navigation relies on acceleration data, gyroscopic data, and global positioning data. This maximizes distance by minimizing corrective maneuvers that waste flight energy.

Contrast this with beam riding systems, like the RIM-8 Talos, in which the radar is pointed at the target and the missile keeps itself centered in the beam by listening to the signal at the rear of the missile body. In the SARH system the missile listens for the reflected signal at the nose, and is still responsible for providing some sort of &quot;lead&quot; guidance. The disadvantages of beam riding are twofold: One is that a radar signal is &quot;fan shaped&quot;, growing larger, and therefore less accurate, with distance. This means that the beam riding system is not accurate at long ranges, while SARH is largely independent of range and grows more accurate as it approaches the target, or the source of the reflected signal it listens for. Reduced accuracy means the missile must use a very large warhead to be effective (i.e.: nuclear). Another requirement is that a beam riding system must accurately track the target at high speeds, typically requiring one radar for tracking and another &quot;tighter&quot; beam for guidance.

The SARH system needs only one radar set to a wider pattern.

==Continuous-wave radar==

Modern SARH systems use continuous-wave radar (CW radar) for guidance. Even though most modern fighter radars are pulse Doppler sets, most have a CW function to guide radar missiles. A few Soviet aircraft, such as some versions of the MiG-23 and MiG-27, used an auxiliary guidance pod or aerial to provide a CW signal. The Vympel R-33 AA missile for MiG-31 interceptor uses SARH as the main type of guidance (with supplement of inertial guidance on initial stage).

SARH missiles require tracking radar to acquire the target, and a more narrowly focused illuminator radar to &quot;light up&quot; the target in order for the missile to lock on to the radar return reflected off target. The target must remain illuminated for the entire duration of the missile&#x27;s flight. This could leave the launch aircraft vulnerable to counterattack, as well as giving the target&#x27;s electronic warning systems time to detect the attack and engage countermeasures. Because most SARH missiles require guidance during their entire flight, older radars are limited to one target per radar emitter at a time.

The maximum range of a SARH system is determined by energy density of the transmitter. Increasing transmit power can increase energy density. Reducing the noise bandwidth of the transmitter can also increase energy density. Spectral density matched to the receive radar detection bandwidth is the limiting factor for maximum range.

==Electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM)==

Recent-generation SARH weapons have superior electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM) capability, but the system still has fundamental limitations. Some newer missiles, such as the SM-2, incorporate terminal semi-active radar homing (TSARH). TSARH missiles use inertial guidance for most of their flight, only activating their SARH system for the final attack. This can keep the target from realising it is under attack until shortly before the missile strikes. Since the missile only requires guidance during the terminal phase, each radar emitter can be used to engage more targets. Some of these weapons, like the SM-2, allow the firing platform to update the missile with mid-course updates via datalink.

Some of the more effective methods used to defeat semi-active homing radar are flying techniques. These depend upon the pilot knowing that a missile has been launched. The global positioning system allows a missile to reach the predicted intercept with no datalink, greatly increasing lethality by postponing illumination for most of the missile flight. The pilot is unaware that a launch has occurred, so flying techniques become almost irrelevant. One difficulty is testing, because this feature creates public safety risks if a fault prevents datalink self-destruct signals when a missile is heading in the wrong direction. Most coastlines are heavily populated, so this risk exists at test centers for sea-based systems that are near the coastlines:
* Pacific Missile Range Facility
* Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapon Division, Point Mugu, China Lake
* Atlantic Test Ranges

==Combat record==
The combat record of U.S. SARH missiles was unimpressive during the Vietnam War. USAF and US Navy fighters armed with AIM-7 Sparrow attained a success rate of barely 10%, which tended to amplify the effect of removing the gun on most F-4 Phantoms, which carried 4 Sparrows. While some of the failures were attributable to mechanical failure of 1960s-era electronics, which could be disturbed by pulling a cart over uneven pavement, or pilot error; the intrinsic accuracy of these weapons was low relative to Sidewinder and guns.

Since Desert Storm, most F-15 Eagle combat victories have been scored with the Sparrow at beyond visual range. Similar performance has been achieved with the sea-launched RIM-7 Sea Sparrow.

Soviet systems using SARH have achieved a number of notable successes, notably in the Yom Kippur War, where 2K12 Kub (NATO name SA-6) tactical SAM systems were able to effectively deny airspace to the Israeli Air Force. A 2K12 also shot down a U.S. F-16 in the Bosnian War.

<doc id="419626" wikidata="Q480132" url="?curid=419626" title="Geoffrey Robinson (politician)">
<text>Geoffrey Robinson (born 25 May 1938) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Coventry North West for 43 years, from 1976 to 2019. He was Paymaster General from May 1997 to December 1998, resigning after The bankruptcy of his company Trans Tec. It was revealed that he had lent his government colleague Peter Mandelson £373,000 to buy a house. From 1996 to 2008 he was the owner of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, a centre-left weekly political magazine.

==Background==
Robinson was born in Sheffield, England, and educated at Emanuel School in Battersea, London, Clare College, Cambridge, and Yale University. On completing his formal education he became a Labour Party researcher before joining the newly created entity the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation, at a time when the British government was promoting a merger between the Leyland Motor Corporation and BMC. The merger duly took place amid high hopes that a solution to the BMC problem was in sight.

==Business career==
A change of government led to a swift demise for the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation, and in 1970 Robinson joined British Leyland, the company in the creation of which he had been instrumental. His initial job title was &quot;Staff executive, facilities planning&quot;, but after four months he was promoted to the position of Financial Controller. It was an unusual appointment in a conservative industry, both on account of his relative youth and because he had no accountancy qualification. (His formal tertiary education had concentrated on Russian, German and, possibly of more direct relevance, Economics.)

Geoffrey Robinson was from 1972 Chairman of Innocenti in Italy, appointed following acquisition of the business by British Leyland, Robinson having played a leading role in acquisition negotiations following the death of Ferdinando Innocenti.

At around that time he accepted an invitation from Jack Butterworth, Baron Butterworth to join the board of Midland Community Radio, the consortium which successfully bid for the Independent Local Radio franchise for Coventry and Warwickshire. The radio station launched as Mercia Sound in 1980.

Late in 1973, he succeeded Lofty England as Chairman of Jaguar Cars, also at that time under British Leyland ownership. He resigned in 1975 because he could not agree with the Ryder plan to integrate the many different makes under BLMC.

After the Triumph Motorcycles workers locked out their new owners, NVT, from their Meriden plant in 1973, Robinson was instrumental in setting up the subsequent Meriden Triumph workers&#x27; co-operative with a substantial Wilson Labour government loan from the minister for trade, Tony Benn. He served as an executive director in what was the last volume manufacturer of motorcycles in the United Kingdom. He occupied a similar non-executive role in the subsequent Triumph Motorcycles (Meriden) Ltd that the co-operative became when he helped negotiate away its debt with the new Conservative Thatcher government in 1981, although he left before the firm eventually closed in 1983.

In 1986, he founded technology company TransTec, which became a £200 million international conglomerate focusing on aerospace customers. In 1996, he acquired the centre-left &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine for £375,000. In April 2008 he sold 50% of the business to Mike Danson, and the remainder a year later.

==Political career==
Robinson became the MP for Coventry North West, a safe Labour Party seat, in a by-election on 4 March 1976 caused by the death of MP Maurice Edelman. His Conservative opponent in the 1987 election was the novelist Jim Powell. During the 1980s, with Labour in opposition, he held frontbench positions, speaking for the party on trade and industry and on science. He was Paymaster General in Tony Blair&#x27;s government from May 1997 to December 1998, resigning after it was revealed that in 1996 he had lent his government colleague Peter Mandelson £373,000 to buy a house.

Robinson&#x27;s previous life as a businessman made him one of the wealthiest members of parliament, with a personal fortune of around £30 million. He is a lover of fine wine and dining. He owns holiday homes in Tuscany (used once by Tony Blair for his summer holiday) and the South of France, and owns a penthouse flat in London&#x27;s Park Lane. He bought the house Orchards in Godalming, Surrey (designed and built by Edwin Lutyens between 1897 and 1899) which has been described as &#x27;among the finest Surrey Houses&#x27;. He also bought and restored Lutyens&#x27; Marshcourt (Stockbridge, Hampshire, 1901–1904) but sold it again in 1999 after resigning as Paymaster General. In November 1997 it was revealed by Chris Blackhurst in an article for the &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; that Robinson had been a discretionary beneficiary of a £12.75 million offshore trust for him and his family established by Joska Bourgeois, called Orion, based in the tax haven of Guernsey. In 2000 the trust was reportedly worth £38 million.

In 2000 Robinson published a memoir of his time in the Blair government, &quot;The Unconventional Minister: My Life Inside New Labour&quot;. Robinson was the subject of Tom Bower&#x27;s 2001 book &quot;The Paymaster&quot;. As a result of the book&#x27;s revelation that Robinson had failed to register the receipt of £200,000 from Robert Maxwell, he was suspended for three weeks from the House of Commons in October 2001.

The &quot;Coventry Telegraph&quot;’s Simon Gilbert claimed in 2015 that Robinson had told party activists he would step down to allow Greg Beales, Director of Strategy and Planning for the Labour Party and a former aide to Ed Miliband, to contest his seat. An email appeared to show Beales and Robinson discussing introductions to prominent members of the local Labour party. The email, apparently sent before any announcement of Robinson&#x27;s resignation, suggested selection of a new MP would take place within two weeks. A second email, addressed to senior members of the local party, stated categorically that Mr Robinson would stand down before the next election; it appears the local Labour party was concerned Labour HQ would deprive them of an opportunity to freely choose the next candidate by strongly referencing Beales. In the end he did not stand down; Robinson contested and won Coventry North West at the 2015 and 2017 elections.

Robinson supported Remain in the EU referendum and subsequently voted against the EU Withdrawal Bill, in line with his party&#x27;s whip.

In May 2019 it was alleged that Robinson had been a spy for the Communist Czechoslovakian government, shared 87 confidential pieces of defence-related information between 1966 and 1969. Robinson is alleged to have had 51 meetings with Czechoslovakian authorities and had also been in contact with Russian KGB agents. He denied the allegations, stating: &quot;at no time did he ever pass confidential government documents or information to any foreign agent and he did not have access to such material.&quot;

Robinson was among a number of Labour MPs who did not seek re-election at the 2019 general election.

==Coventry City F.C.==
Robinson has had a long association with Coventry City F.C., being a member of the board of directors from 1996. In 1997, when Robinson was made Paymaster General, he was forced to stand down from the board because members of the government were not permitted to hold directorships. Brenda Price, a former colleague from his Triumph Motorcycle board days at Meriden sat on the Coventry City board with him. In response to this the football club named him as honorary President but he eventually re-took his seat on the board of directors in 2002. On 21 September 2005, Robinson was named as acting Chairman of Coventry City after chairman Mike McGinnity was asked to step down by his doctor for an indefinite period due to ongoing health problems. Robinson was appointed chairman permanently on 3 November after McGinnity was forced to resign due to his health problems. On 10 October 2007 he announced that he would step down as chairman because &quot;there are not enough hours in the day&quot;. He remains a director of the club.

==Personal life==
Robinson married Marie Elena Giorgio in 1967. They have a son and a daughter.

<doc id="419628" wikidata="Q4461769" url="?curid=419628" title="Bagmati River">
<text>The Bagmati River flows through the Kathmandu valley of Nepal, separating the cities of Kathmandu and Patan, before flowing through Madesh Province of southern Nepal and joining the Kamla River in the Indian state of Bihar. It is considered holy by both Hindus and Buddhists. A number of Hindu temples are located on its banks.

The importance of the Bagmati also lies in the fact that Hindus are cremated on the banks of this holy river, and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side. According to the Nepalese Hindu tradition, the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation, so that the reincarnation cycle may be ended. The chief mourner (usually the first son) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy river-water bath immediately after cremation. Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take a bath in the river or sprinkle holy water on their bodies at the end of the cremation. It is believed that the Bagmati River purifies people spiritually.

==History==
The Bagmati River is considered the source of Nepalese civilization and urbanization. The river has been mentioned as &quot;Vaggumuda&quot; () in Vinaya Pitaka and &quot;Nandabagga&quot;. It has also been mentioned as &quot;Bahumati&quot; () in &quot;Battha Suttanta&quot; of Majjhima Nikaya. An inscription dated AD 477 describes the river as &quot;Bagvati parpradeshe&quot; () and subsequently also in the Gopalraj Vanshavali.

==Geography==

The basin of the Bagmati river, including the Kathmandu valley, lies between the much larger Gandaki basin to the west and the Koshi basin to the east. These adjacent basins extend north of the main Himalayan range and cross it in tremendous gorges, in fact, the Arun tributary of the Koshi extends far into Tibet. The smaller Bagmati rises some distance south of the Himalayas. Without glacial sources, its flow is more dependent on rainfall, becoming very low during the hot season (April to early June), then peaking during the monsoon season (mid-June to mid-August). In these respects, the Bagmati system resembles the (West) Rapti system lying between the Gandaki basin and the Karnali basin in the far west of Nepal.

The Bagmati originates where three headwater streams converge at Bāghdwār Falls (), where the water flows out through a gargoyle shaped like a tiger&#x27;s mouth, situated in Shivpuri Nagarjun National Park near Sundarijal in Nepal . This lies above the southern edge of the Shivapuri Hills, about northeast of Kathmandu. Here the Bagmati is wide and swift with a high load of suspended solids, giving it a grey appearance. The river flows southwest about through terraced rice fields in the Kathmandu Valley.

Resistant rock strata interrupt the flow in places, including at Pashupatinath Temple. Beyond the temple, the river flows south until joined by the larger west-flowing Monahara River, then turns west itself. After entering Kathmandu&#x27;s urban area, more tributaries enter: relatively unpolluted Dhobī Kholā and sewage-laden Tukucha Khola. Then the river bends south and the Bishnumati enters from the right at Teku Dovan. The Bishnumati also rises in the Shivapuri Hills, some west of the Bagmati&#x27;s source. It flows south past the Nagarjun Hill, Swayambhu Stupa and Durbar Square in Kathmandu. As it passes the centre of Kathmandu, this tributary becomes heavily polluted and choked with trash.

Flowing generally south although with many curves, the Bagmati reaches the edge of the Kathmandu valley and enters Chobhar gorge near the Dakshinkali temple complex. The Chobhar gorge cuts through the Mahabharat range, also called the Lesser Himalaya. This range is the southern limit of the &quot;middle hills&quot; across Nepal, an important cultural boundary between distinctive Nepali and more Indian cultures and languages, as well as a major geological feature. The Bagmati also crosses the lower Sivalik Hills before reaching the Terai, then crosses into India at Bairgania. It flows across the districts Darbhanga, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Muzaffarpur and Khagaria in Bihar. It meets River Kamala at Jagmohra Village of Samastipur. However, in past the river had a different course and used to drain directly into the Ganges. In &quot;Swasthani Bratakatha&quot; of the Skanda Purana, Bagmati&#x27;s present northern tributary was regarded as main channel called Sāli river which was a tributary of Gandaki and it is obvious since Manohara river, the present day Sali river, is larger than Bagmati at their confluence.

==Pollution==

The Bagmati River contains large amounts of untreated sewage, and large levels of pollution of the river exist due primarily to the region&#x27;s large population. Many residents in Kathmandu empty their personal garbage and waste into the river. In particular the Hanumante Khola, Dhobī Kholā, Tukucha Khola and Bishnumati are the most polluted. Attempts are being made to monitor the Bagmati river system and restore its cleanliness. These include &quot;pollution loads modification, flow augmentation and placement of weirs at critical locations&quot;.

On 18 May 2013, under the initiative of then chief secretary Leela Mani Poudyal, the Bagmati Mega Clean-Up Campaign was started. Every Saturday, personnels of the Nepal Army and Nepal Police, along with the general public, gather to clean the waste and sewage from the river. 

==Flood==
There is no effect of flood in most of the areas that it touches, but it has caused widespread sufferings to the people in Terai and northern districts of Bihar. The worst destruction by the river were seen in 1993. Poor water management, lack of proper weather forecasting and awareness were the main cause of mass destruction.

==Shrines==

*Gokarneshwor – Gokarneshwor Mahadev temple stands the banks of the Bagmati, built in 1582. In late August or early September, people go to this temple to bathe and make offerings in honor of their fathers, living or dead, on a day called Gokarna Aunsi also known as &quot;Kuse Aunsi&quot; (worshipping for the eternal peace of Father).
*Guhyeshwari Temple – Guhyeshwari Temple, the temple of Guhyeshwari Devi, lies about 1 km east of Pashupatinath Temple on the banks of the Bagmati. The temple&#x27;s name originates from the Sanskrit words &quot;Guhya&quot; (secret) and &quot;Ishwari&quot; (goddess). In &quot;Lalitha Sahasranama&quot;, the 707th name of Goddess is mentioned as Guhyarupini (the form of goddess is beyond human perception and is secret. Another argument is that it is the secret 16th syllable of the Shodashi Mantra) (LS 137th verse: &quot;Sarasvati shastramayi| Guhaamba guhyaruupini||&quot;). It is believed that parts of Sati Devi&#x27;s corpse fell in different region when Shiva took it and roamed around the world in sorrow.
*Pashupatinath Temple – The Pashupatinath Temple, dedicated to Shiva, stands on an outcrop above the river north of Kathmandu. It is considered to be one of the holy places of Hinduism.
*Koteshwor Mahadev – Koteshwor Mahadev temple at Koteshwor is also a major holy place located in bank of Bagmati. According to a popular legend, the Shiva Lingam here is believed to be one of the 64 sacred Shiva Lingams.
*Shankhamul – Near the Koteshwor Mahadev temple is a place known as Shankhamul. Shankhamul is one of the twelve “most-sacred” confluences in the Kathmandu valley as defined in the numerous chronicles that document the history and legends about the Kathmandu valley. At Shankhamul, the Bagmati river that flows south from the Pashupati temple complex, and all the rivers that flow from the eastern part of the valley including the Manohara river merge.
*Kalmochan Temple – Kalmochan temple, dedicated to the Hindu god Lord Vishnu the preserver, was a part of the Thapathali Durbar complex in bank of Bagmati river. It was built in the early 18th century. The temple was built by Jung Bahadur Rana in Moghul Kathmandu-Gothic architecture style and has Mughal art and Nepali art. Also known as &quot;Janga Hiranya Hemnarayan Mandir&quot;, it is located at Kalmochan Ghāt in Thapathali.
*Tripureshwor Temple – The temple of Tripureshwor Mahadev near Kalmochan Ghāt, is the largest temple in Kathmandu valley, built by Lalit Tripura Sundari Devi in the nineteenth century (around 1875 B.S). It has three roofs—the upper two crafted of metal, while the bottom one is of baked terracota—and sits on a raised platform. The temple was made in the memory of her husband, King Rana Bahadur Shah for his eternal bliss and for the goodwill of her nation. It was probably the last major temple in the tiered style.
*Pachali Bhairav – Established by Lichhavi king Gunakamadev (AD 924–1008), the god is very much associated with the founding of Kathmandu, because it was King Gunakamadev who is traditionally believed to have founded both the city and the festival of Bhairav which is located in the bank of Bagmati river.
*Teku Dovan – One of the 12 sacred &quot;Tirthas&quot; in the Kathmandu valley, the ghāts along &quot;Gyan Tirtha&quot;, at the confluence of Bagmati and Bishnumati, are places for ritual bathing and cremation at or near rivers.
*Jal Binayak Temple – Jal Binayak Temple is a temple of Ganesh, located in the Chobhar. The Jal Binayak Temple is one of the most important Ganesh shrine in Kathmandu region, and is one of the four &quot;Binayak&quot; temples of the Kathmandu valley.
