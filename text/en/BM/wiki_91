<text>The St. Francis Dam, or the San Francisquito Dam, was a concrete gravity dam located in San Francisquito Canyon in northern Los Angeles County, California, United States, that was built between 1924 and 1926. The dam failed catastrophically in 1928, killing at least 431 people in the subsequent flood, in what is considered to have been one of the worst American civil engineering disasters of the 20th century and the third-greatest loss of life in California history.

The dam was built to serve the growing water needs of the city of Los Angeles, creating a large regulating and storage reservoir that was an integral part of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. It was located in San Francisquito Canyon of the Sierra Pelona Mountains, about northwest of downtown Los Angeles, and approximately north of the present day city of Santa Clarita. 

However, a defective soil foundation and design flaws led to the dam&#x27;s collapse just two years after its completion. Its failure ended the career of William Mulholland, the general manager and chief engineer of the Bureau of Water Works and Supply (now the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power).

== Background ==
In the early years of Los Angeles, the city&#x27;s water supply was obtained from the Los Angeles River. This was accomplished by diverting water from the river through a series of ditches called &quot;zanjas&quot;. At that time, a private water company, the Los Angeles City Water Company, leased the city&#x27;s waterworks and provided water to the city. Hired in 1878 as a &quot;zanjero&quot; (ditch tender), William Mulholland proved to be a brilliant employee who, after doing his day&#x27;s work, would study textbooks on mathematics, hydraulics and geology, thereby teaching himself geology and engineering. Mulholland quickly moved up the ranks of the Water Company and was promoted to superintendent in 1886.

In 1902, the City of Los Angeles ended its lease with the Water Company and took control over the city&#x27;s water supply. The Los Angeles City Council established the Water Department renamed the Bureau of Water Works and Supply in 1911 with Mulholland as its superintendent. Mulholland was concurrently named as the Bureau&#x27;s chief engineer following the organization&#x27;s name change.

Mulholland achieved great recognition among members of the engineering community when he supervised the design and construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which at the time was the longest aqueduct in the world. It used gravity alone to bring the water from the Owens Valley to Los Angeles. The project was completed in 1913, on time and under budget, despite several setbacks. Excluding incidents of sabotage by Owens Valley residents in the early years, the aqueduct has continued to operate well throughout its history and remains in operation today.

== Planning and design ==

It was during the process of building the aqueduct that Mulholland first considered sections of San Francisquito Canyon as a potential dam site. He felt that there should be a reservoir of sufficient size to provide water for Los Angeles for an extended period in the event of a drought or if the aqueduct were damaged by an earthquake. In particular, he favored the area between where the hydroelectric power plants Powerhouses and were to be built, with what he perceived as favorable topography, a natural narrowing of the canyon downstream of a wide, upstream platform which would allow the creation of a large reservoir area with a minimum possible dam. A large camp had been set up to house the workers near this area, and Mulholland used his spare time becoming familiar with the area&#x27;s geological features.

In the area where the dam would later be situated, Mulholland found the mid- and upper portion of the western hillside consisted mainly of a reddish-colored conglomerate and sandstone formation that had small veins of gypsum interspersed within it. Below the red conglomerate, down the remaining portion of the western hillside, crossing the canyon floor and up the eastern wall, a drastically different rock composition prevailed. These areas were made up of mica schist that was severely laminated, cross-faulted in many areas, and interspersed with talc. Later, although many geologists disagreed on the exact location of the area of contact between the two formations, a majority opinion placed it at the inactive San Francisquito Fault line. Mulholland ordered exploratory tunnels and shafts excavated into the red conglomerate hillside to determine its characteristics and had water percolation tests performed. The results convinced him that the hill would make a satisfactory abutment for a dam should the need ever arise.

A surprising aspect of the early geologic exploration came later, when the need for a dam arose. Although Mulholland wrote of the unstable nature of the face of schist on the eastern side of the canyon in his annual report to the Board of Public Works in 1911, this fact was either misjudged or ignored by Stanley Dunham, the construction supervisor of the St. Francis Dam. Dunham testified, at the coroner&#x27;s inquest, that tests which he had ordered yielded results which showed the rock to be hard and of the same nature throughout the entire area which became the eastern abutment. His opinion was that this area was more than suitable for construction of the dam.

The population of Los Angeles was increasing rapidly. In 1900 the population was slightly over 100,000. By 1910, it had become more than three times that number at 320,000, and by 1920 the figure reached 576,673. This unexpectedly rapid growth brought a demand for a larger water supply. Between 1920 and 1926, seven smaller reservoirs were built and modifications were made to raise the height of the water bureau&#x27;s largest of the time, the Lower San Fernando reservoir, by seven feet, but the need for a still-larger reservoir was clear.

Originally, the planned site of this new large reservoir was to be in Big Tujunga Canyon, above the community now known as Sunland, in the northeast portion of the San Fernando Valley, but the high asking prices of the ranches and private land which had to be acquired were, in Mulholland&#x27;s view, an attempted hold-up of the city. He ceased attempts at purchasing those lands and, either forgetful of or disregarding his earlier acknowledgement of geological problems at the site, renewed his interest in the area he had explored twelve years earlier, the federally owned and far less expensive private land in San Francisquito Canyon.

== Construction and modification ==

The process of surveying the area and determining the location for the St. Francis Dam began in December 1922. Clearing of the site and construction began without any of the usual fanfare for a municipal project of this nature. The Los Angeles Aqueduct had become the target of frequent sabotage by angry farmers and landowners in the Owens Valley and the city was eager to avoid any repeat of these expensive and time-consuming repairs.

The St. Francis Dam, sometimes referred to as the San Francisquito Dam, was only the second concrete dam to be designed and built by the Bureau of Water Works and Supply. The first was the nearly dimensionally-identical Mulholland Dam, on which construction had begun one year earlier. The design of the St. Francis Dam was in fact an adaptation of the Mulholland Dam, with modifications made so as to suit the site. Most of the design profiles and computation figures of stress factors for the St. Francis Dam came from this adaptation of the plans and formulas which had been used in the constructing of the Mulholland Dam. This work was done by the engineering department within the Bureau of Water Works and Supply.

In describing the shape and type of the St. Francis Dam, the word &quot;curved&quot; is used although, by today&#x27;s standards, due to the amount of curve in its radius, the dam would be considered arched, therefore making it of the arch-gravity design. It was not so called because the science of arch-gravity dams was still in its infancy. Little was known in the engineering community about the arch effect, how it worked and how loads were transmitted, other than that it did help with stability and support. As such, the dam was designed without any of the additional benefits given by the arch action, which led to its profile being considered conservative, given its size.

Annually, as did most other city entities, the Bureau of Water Works and Supply and the ancillary departments reported to the Board of Public Service Commissioners on the prior fiscal year&#x27;s activities. From these we know that the preliminary studies of the area which became the site of the St. Francis Dam, and topographical surveys for the dam, were completed by June 1923. They called for a dam built to the elevation of above sea level, which is above the stream bed base. These early calculations for a reservoir created by the dam revealed it would have a capacity of approximately .

On July 1, 1924, the same day Mulholland was to submit his annual report to the Board of Public Service Commissioners, Office Engineer W. W. Hurlbut informed him that all of the preliminary work on the dam had been completed. In his report presented to the Board, Mulholland wrote that the capacity of the reservoir would be (). Hurlbut, who also presented the Board with his annual report, &quot;Report of the Office Engineer&quot;, gave a clarification for this change from the prior year&#x27;s estimate. In his report he wrote that:

...at the St. Francis Reservoir the dam site has been cleared and the foundation trench started. All concrete placing equipment has been contracted for and it is expected actual work of pouring the concrete will start in approximately ninety days. Additional topographic surveys have been completed and disclose a storage capacity of 32,000 acre feet at elevation 1825 feet above sea level.

Construction of the dam itself began five weeks later, in early August, when the first concrete was poured.

In March 1925, prior to Mulholland&#x27;s report to the Board of Public Service Commissioners, Hurlbut again reported to Mulholland on the progress of the St. Francis project. He stated the reservoir would now have a capacity of () and that the dam&#x27;s height would be above stream bed level. Hurlbut wrote, in an explanation of these changes that was presented to the Board of Public Service Commissioners, that:

Additional surveys and changes in the plans for this reservoir have disclosed the fact that at crest elevation of 1835 feet above sea level the reservoir will have a capacity of 38,000 acre-feet.

This increase in the dam&#x27;s height over the original plan of 1923 necessitated the construction of a long wing dike along the top of the ridge adjacent to the western abutment in order to contain the enlarged reservoir.

A distinctive aspect of the St. Francis Dam was its stepped downstream face. While the height of each step was a constant , the width of each step was unique to its respective elevation above sea level. This width varied between near the stream bed base at and decreased to at an elevation of , the base of the spillways and upright panels.

When completed on May 4, 1926, the stairstep-faced dam rose to a height of 185 feet above the canyon floor. Both faces leading up to the crest were vertical for the final . On the downstream face, this vertical section was fashioned into wide sections. A portion of these made up the spillway, which consisted of eleven panels in total divided into two groups. Each spillway section had an open area that was high and wide for the overflow to pass. The dam also had five diameter outlet pipes through the center section which were controlled by slide gates attached to the upstream face.

== Dam instability ==
Water began to fill the reservoir on March 12, 1926. It rose steadily and rather uneventfully, although several temperature and contraction cracks did appear in the dam, and a minor amount of seepage began to flow from under the abutments. In accord with the protocol for design, which had been established by the Engineering department during construction of the Mulholland Dam, no contraction joints were incorporated. The most notable incidents were two vertical cracks that ran down through the dam from the top; one was approximately west of the outlet gates and another about the same distance to the east. Mulholland, along with his Assistant Chief Engineer and General Manager Harvey Van Norman, inspected the cracks and judged them to be within expectation for a concrete dam the size of the St. Francis.

At the beginning of April, the water level reached the area of the inactive San Francisquito Fault line in the western abutment. Some seepage began almost immediately as the water covered this area. Workers were ordered to seal off the leak, but they were not entirely successful, and water continued to permeate through the face of the dam. A two-inch pipe was used to collect this seepage and was laid from the fault line down to the home of the dam keeper, Tony Harnischfeger, which he used for domestic purposes. Water that collected in the drainage pipes under the dam to relieve the hydrostatic uplift pressure was carried off in this manner as well.

In April 1927 the reservoir level was brought to within of the spillway, and during most of May the water level was within of overflowing. There were no large changes in the amount of the seepage that was collected and, month after month, the pipe flowed about one-third full. This was an insignificant amount for a dam the size of the St. Francis, and on this subject Mulholland said, &quot;Of all the dams I have built and of all the dams I have ever seen, it was the driest dam of its size I ever saw.&quot; The seepage data recorded during the 1926–1927 period shows that the dam was an exceptionally dry structure.

On May 27, 1927, the problems in the Owens Valley escalated once again with the dynamiting of a large section of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, part of the California Water Wars. A second incident took place a few days later, destroying another large section. In the days that followed, several more sections of the aqueduct were dynamited which caused a complete disruption of the flow. The near-full reservoir behind the St. Francis Dam was the only source of water from the north and withdrawals began immediately.

During this time, the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department received an anonymous phone call that a carload of men were on their way from Inyo County with the intention of dynamiting the dam and &quot;to get some officers on the way as quick as possible.&quot; Within minutes, all personnel of the Bureau of Power and Light and the Bureau of Water Works and Supply either working or residing within the canyon had been notified. Cars carrying dozens of officers from both the Los Angeles Police and Sheriff&#x27;s Departments rushed to the area. Although no sign of the threat that brought all this about materialized, for many days after, the canyon resembled an armed encampment.

The Daily Record of High Water Elevations of the St. Francis Dam shows that between May 27 and June 30 alone, 7000 to 8000 acre-feet of water was withdrawn. Through June and July the Owens Valley fight continued, as did interruptions in the flow from the aqueduct. This in turn caused continued withdrawals from the reservoir. In early August, opposition to Los Angeles&#x27;s water projects collapsed after the indictment of its leaders for embezzlement. The city subsequently sponsored a series of repair and maintenance programs for aqueduct facilities that stimulated local employment. 

The St. Francis reservoir level rose once again, although not without incident. Late in 1927, a fracture was noticed which began at the western abutment and ran diagonally upwards and toward the center section for a distance. As with others, Mulholland inspected the fracture, judged it to be another contraction crack and ordered it filled with oakum and grouted to seal off any seepage. At the same time, another fracture appeared in a corresponding position on the eastern portion of the dam, starting at the crest near the last spillway section and running downward at an angle for sixty-five feet before ending at the hillside. It too was sealed in the same manner. Both of these fractures were noted to be wider at their junction with the hillside abutments and narrowed as they angled toward the top of the dam.

The reservoir continued to rise steadily until early February 1928, when the water level was brought to within one foot of the spillway. During this time though, several new cracks appeared in the wing dike, and new areas of seepage began from under both abutments. Near the end of February, a notable leak began at the base of the wing dike approximately west of the main dam, discharging about 0.60 cubic feet per second (4.5 U.S. gallons, or 17 liters, per second). The fracture was inspected by Mulholland, who judged it to be another contraction or temperature crack and left it open to drain. During the first week of March, it was noticed that the leak had approximately doubled. Due in part to some erosion taking place, Mulholland ordered an eight-inch (20.3 cm) concrete drain pipe to be installed. The pipe led the water along the dike wall, discharging it at the west abutment contact with the main dam. This gave the hillside a very saturated appearance, and the water flowing down the steps of the dam where it abutted the hill caused alarm among the canyon residents and others traveling on the road to the east, as at that distance it appeared the water was coming from the abutment.

On March 7, 1928, the reservoir was three inches below the spillway crest and Mulholland ordered that no more water be turned into the St. Francis Dam. Five days later, while conducting his morning rounds, Harnischfeger discovered a new leak in the west abutment. Concerned not only because other leaks had appeared in this same area in the past but more so that the muddy color of the runoff he observed could indicate the water was eroding the foundation of the dam, he immediately alerted Mulholland. After arriving, both Mulholland and Van Norman began inspecting the area of the leak. Van Norman found the source and by following the runoff, determined that the muddy appearance of the water was not from the leak itself but came from where the water contacted loose soil from a newly cut access road. The leak was discharging per second of water by their approximation. Mulholland and Van Norman&#x27;s concern was heightened not only by the leak&#x27;s location but by the inconsistent volume of the discharge, according to their testimony at the coroner&#x27;s inquest. On two occasions as they watched, an acceleration or surging of the flow was noticed by both men. Mulholland felt that some corrective measures were needed, although this could be done at some time in the future.

For the next two hours Mulholland, Van Norman and Harnischfeger inspected the dam and various leaks and seepages, finding nothing out of the ordinary or of concern for a large dam. With both Mulholland and Van Norman convinced that the new leak was not dangerous and that the dam was safe, they returned to Los Angeles.

== Collapse and flood wave ==
Two and a half minutes before midnight on March 12, 1928, the St. Francis Dam catastrophically failed.
There were no surviving eyewitnesses to the collapse, but at least five people passed the dam less than an hour before without noticing anything unusual. The last, Ace Hopewell, a carpenter at Powerhouse , rode his motorcycle past the dam about ten minutes before midnight. At the coroner&#x27;s inquest, Hopewell testified he had passed Powerhouse without seeing anything there or at the dam that caused him concern. He stated at approximately one and one-half miles (2.4 km) upstream he heard, above his motorcycle&#x27;s engine noise, a rumbling much like the sound of &quot;rocks rolling on the hill.&quot; Hopewell stopped, got off his motorcycle and smoked a cigarette while checking the hillsides. The rumbling had begun to fade, and Hopewell assumed the sound was a landslide common to the area. Hopewell finished his cigarette, got back on his motorcycle and left. He was the last person to see the St. Francis Dam intact and survive.

At both of the Bureau of Power and Light&#x27;s receiving stations in Los Angeles and at the Bureau of Water Works and Supply at Powerhouse , there was a sharp voltage drop at Simultaneously, a transformer at Southern California Edison&#x27;s (SCE) Saugus substation exploded, a situation investigators later determined was caused by wires up the western hillside of San Francisquito Canyon about ninety feet above the dam&#x27;s east abutment shorting.


Given the known height of the flood wave, and the fact that within seventy minutes or less after the collapse the reservoir was virtually empty, the failure must have been sudden and complete. Seconds after it began, little of the dam remained standing, other than the center section and wing wall. The main dam, from west of the center section to the wing wall abutment atop the hillside, broke into several large pieces and numerous smaller pieces. All of these were washed downstream as 12.4 billion gallons (47 million m³) of water began surging down San Francisquito Canyon. The largest piece, weighing approximately 10,000 tons (9,000 metric tons) was found about three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) below the dam site.

Somewhat similarly, the dam portion east of the center section had also broken into several larger and smaller pieces. Unlike the western side, most of these came to rest near the base of the standing section. The largest fragments fell across the lower portion of the standing section, coming to rest partially on its upstream face. Initially, the two remaining sections of the dam remained upright. As the reservoir lowered, water undercut the already undermined eastern portion, which twisted and fell backwards toward the eastern hillside, breaking into three sections.

Harnischfeger and his family were most likely among the first casualties caught in the initial high flood wave, which swept over their cottage about downstream from the dam. The body of a woman who lived with the family was found fully clothed and wedged between two blocks of concrete near the base of the dam. This led to the suggestion she and Harnischfeger may have been inspecting the structure immediately before its failure. Neither Harnischfeger&#x27;s body nor that of his six-year-old son were found.

Five minutes after the collapse, the then flood wave had traveled one and one-half miles () at an average speed of , destroying Powerhouse and taking the lives of 64 of the 67 workmen and their families who lived nearby. This cut power to much of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. Power was quickly restored via tie-lines with SCE, but as the floodwater entered the Santa Clara riverbed it overflowed the river&#x27;s banks, flooding parts of present-day Valencia and Newhall. At about 12:40 a.m. SCE&#x27;s two main lines into the city were destroyed by the flooding, re-darkening the areas that had earlier lost power and spreading the outage to other areas served by SCE. Nonetheless, power to most of the areas not flooded was restored with power from SCE&#x27;s Long Beach steam–electric generating plant.

Near the mass of water, then high, followed the river bed west and demolished SCE&#x27;s Saugus substation, cutting power to the entire Santa Clara River Valley and parts of Ventura and Oxnard. At least four miles of the state&#x27;s main north–south highway was under water and the town of Castaic Junction was being washed away.

The flood entered the Santa Clarita River Valley at . Approximately five miles downstream, near the Ventura–Los Angeles county line, a temporary construction camp SCE had set up for its 150-man crew on the flats of the riverbank was hit. In the confusion, SCE personnel had been unable to issue a warning and 84 workers perished. Shortly before , a Santa Clara River Valley telephone operator learned from the Pacific Long Distance Telephone Company that the St. Francis Dam had failed. She called a motorcycle officer with the State Motor Division, then began calling the homes of those in danger. The officer went door-to-door warning residents about the imminent flood. At the same time, a deputy sheriff drove up the valley, toward the flood, with his siren blaring, until he had to stop at Fillmore.

The flood heavily damaged the towns of Fillmore, Bardsdale and Santa Paula before emptying both victims and debris into the Pacific Ocean downstream south of Ventura, at what is now the West Montalvo Oil Field, around , at which point the wave was almost two miles () wide and still traveling at .

Newspapers across the country carried accounts of the disaster. The front page of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; ran four stories, including aerial photos of the collapsed dam and the ruins of Santa Paula. In a statement, Mulholland said, &quot;I would not venture at this time to express a positive opinion as to the cause of the St. Francis Dam disaster... Mr. Van Norman and I arrived at the scene of the break around 2:30a.m. this morning. We saw at once that the dam was completely out and that the torrential flood of water from the reservoir had left an appalling record of death and destruction in the valley below.&quot; Mulholland stated that it appeared that there had been major movement in the hills forming the western buttress of the dam, adding that three eminent geologists, Robert T. Hill, C. F. Tolman and D.W. Murphy, had been hired by the Board of Water and Power Commissioners to determine if this was the cause.

== Investigation ==
There were at least a dozen investigations into the disaster. With unprecedented speed, eight of these had begun by the weekend following the collapse. Almost all involved investigative panels of prominent engineers and geologists. The more notable of these groups and committees were those sponsored by Governor C. C. Young, headed by A. J. Wiley, the renowned dam engineer and consultant to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s Boulder (Hoover) Dam Board; the Los Angeles City Council, which was chaired by the Chief of the Reclamation Service, Elwood Mead; Los Angeles County Coroner Frank Nance, and Los Angeles County District Attorney Asa Keyes. Others were convened: the Water and Power Commissioners started their own inquiry, as did the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, who hired J. B. Lippincott. The Santa Clara River Protective Association employed the geologist and Stanford University professor emeritus, Dr. Bailey Willis, and eminent San Francisco civil engineer and past president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Carl E. Grunsky. There were still others, such as the state railroad commission and several political entities who only sent investigators or representatives.

Although they were not unanimous on all points, most commissions quickly reached their conclusions. The governor&#x27;s commission met on March 19 and submitted their 79-page report to the governor on March 24, only eleven days after the collapse. Although this may have been sufficient time to answer what they had been directed to determine, they had been deprived of the sworn testimony at the coroner&#x27;s inquest, which was scheduled to be convened March 21, the only inquiry that took into consideration factors other than geology and engineering.

The need for immediate answers was understandable, having its roots in the Swing–Johnson Bill in Congress. This bill, which had first been filed in 1922, and failed to be voted on in three successive Congresses, was again before Congress at the time. This bill ultimately provided the funding for constructing the Hoover Dam. Supporters and responsible leaders alike realized the jeopardy in which the bill stood. Although the water and electricity from the project were needed, the idea of the construction of such a massive dam of similar design, which would create a reservoir seven hundred times larger than the St. Francis, did not sit well with many in light of the recent disaster and the devastation. The bill was passed by Congress and signed into law by U.S. President Calvin Coolidge on December 21, 1928.

The governor&#x27;s commission was the first to release its findings, titled &quot;Report of the Commission appointed by Governor C. C. Young to investigate the causes leading to the failure of the St. Francis dam near Saugus, California&quot;. The report became the most widely distributed analysis. Along with most of the other investigators, they perceived the new leak as the key to understanding the collapse, although the commission believed that &quot;the foundation under the entire dam left very much to be desired.&quot; The report stated, &quot;With such a formation, the ultimate failure of this dam was inevitable, unless water could have been kept from reaching the foundation. Inspection galleries, pressure grouting, drainage wells and deep cut-off walls are commonly used to prevent or remove percolation, but it is improbable that any or all of these devices would have been adequately effective, though they would have ameliorated the conditions and postponed the final failure.&quot; They placed the cause of the failure on the western hillside. &quot;The west end,&quot; the commission stated, &quot;was founded upon a reddish conglomerate which, even when dry, was of decidedly inferior strength and which, when wet, became so soft that most of it lost almost all rock characteristics.&quot; The softening of the &quot;reddish conglomerate&quot; undermined the west side. &quot;The rush of water released by failure of the west end caused a heavy scour against the easterly canyon wall ... and caused the failure of that part of the structure.&quot; There then &quot;quickly followed ... the collapse of large sections of the dam.&quot;

The committee appointed by the Los Angeles City Council for the most part concurred in attributing the collapse to &quot;defective foundations&quot;, and wrote, &quot;The manner of failure was that the first leak, however started, began under the concrete at that part of the dam which stood on the red conglomerate; this leak increased in volume as it scoured away the foundation material already greatly softened by infiltrated water from the reservoir which removed the support of the dam at this point and since no arch action could occur by reason of the yielding conglomerate abutment, made failure of the dam inevitable.&quot; Likewise, they concluded the failure most likely followed a pattern similar to that which was proposed by the governor&#x27;s commission, although they did acknowledge that &quot;the sequence of failure is uncertain.&quot;

The committee ended their report with, &quot;...having examined all the evidence which it has been able to obtain to date reports its conclusions as follows:

# The type and dimensions of the dam were amply sufficient if based on suitable foundation.
# The concrete of which the dam was built was of ample strength to resist the stresses to which it would normally be subjected.
# The failure cannot be laid to movement of the earth&#x27;s crust.
# The dam failed as a result of defective foundations.
# This failure reflects in no way the stability of a well designed gravity dam properly founded on suitable bedrock.&quot;
The consensus of most of the investigating commissions was that the initial break had taken place at or near the fault line on the western abutment, which had been a problem area since water first covered the area. The prevailing thought was that increasing water percolation through the fault line had either undermined or weakened the foundation to a point that a portion of the structure blew out or the dam collapsed from its own immense weight. This was supported by a chart made by the automatic water level recorder located on the dam&#x27;s center section. This chart clearly showed that there had been no significant change in the reservoir level until forty minutes before the dam&#x27;s failure, at which time a small though gradually increasing loss was recorded.

The only theory to vary greatly from the others was that of Willis, Grunsky and his son. They believed that the portion of the east abutment below the dam was the first to give way, clearing the way for the collapse to take place. Their investigations, while somewhat collaborative, culminated in two separate reports (one by the Grunskys and the other by Willis) which were completed in April 1928. These reports, according to Grunsky, &quot;were reached independently&quot; and &quot;are in substantial agreement.&quot;

Willis and the Grunskys agreed with the other engineers and investigators about the poor quality and deteriorating conditions of the entire foundation, although they maintained that a critical situation developed on the east abutment. Willis, the geologist of the investigative team, was most likely the first to discover the &quot;old landslide&quot; within the mountains which had made the eastern abutment for the dam. In his report, he discussed it at great length and the Grunskys drew substantially on it, as they did his analysis of the schist, for their own report. The Grunskys, as civil engineers, took the lead in that area of the investigation, and in describing the role played by &quot;hydrostatic uplift&quot;.

Uplift takes its name from its tendency to lift a dam upward. Although many designers and builders of dams had become aware of this phenomenon by the late 1890s to early 1900s, it was still not generally well understood or appreciated. Nevertheless, it was becoming a matter of debate and a concern to dam builders of this era that water from a reservoir could seep under a dam and exert pressure upward. Due for the most part to inadequate drainage of the base and side abutments, the phenomenon of uplift destabilizes gravity dams by reducing the structure&#x27;s &quot;effective weight&quot;, making it less able to resist horizontal water pressure. Uplift can act through the bedrock foundation: the condition most commonly develops where the bedrock foundation is strong enough to bear the weight of the dam, but is fractured or fissured and therefore susceptible to seepage and water saturation.

According to their theories, water from the reservoir had permeated far back into the schist formation of the eastern abutment. This lubricated the rock and it slowly began to move, exerting a tremendous amount of weight against the dam, which according to the Grunskys was already becoming less stable due to &quot;uplift&quot;. Making the situation worse, Willis established, was that the conglomerate, on which the western abutment of the dam rested, reacted upon becoming wet by swelling. In fact, the amount of swelling was such that it would raise any structure built upon it.
This hypothesis was reinforced when surveys taken of the wing wall after the failure were compared with those taken at the time it was built. They reveal that in some areas the wall was two to six inches higher than when built. Therefore, the dam was caught between forces that were acting on it much like a vise, as the red conglomerate swelled on one side, and the moving mountain pressed in on it from the other.

In his report, Grunsky concluded:

As soon as the dam was loosened on its base the toe of the structure spalled off. This was probably the beginning of its breaking up, and probably occurred sometime after 11:30 PM during the 23 minutes in which the water in the reservoir apparently fell 3/10 of a foot. Thereupon, quite likely, a part of the east end of the dam, meanwhile undermined, went out and the dam at this end lost its hillside support. Hydrostatic uplift at the already loose west and the weight of the remaining portion of the undermined east end caused a temporary tilting of the dam towards the east, accompanied by a rapid washing away of the hillside under the dam at its west end which then also began to break up. The reservoir water was now rushing with tremendous force against both ends and against the upstream face of all that was standing of the dam. This rush of water carried away huge blocks of concrete from both ends of the dam...

There was and remains a difference of professional opinions on the amount of time that elapsed, shown by the chart made by the Stevens automatic water level recorder, from when the line indicating the reservoir level broke sharply downward until it became perpendicular. Most investigating engineers feel the amount of time indicated on the chart is thirty to forty minutes, not the twenty-three minutes that Grunsky stated.

In support of his theory of the dam tilting, Grunsky pointed to an odd clue near the western lower edge of the standing section. Here a ladder had become wedged in a crack that had opened apparently during this rocking or tilting process and then had become tightly pinched in place as the section settled back on its foundation. Measurements taken proved the crack must have been much wider at the time that the ladder entered it. Further, surveys indeed showed the center section had been subjected to severe tilting or twisting. These surveys established that the center section had moved downstream and toward the eastern abutment.

Although this investigation was insightful and informative, the theory, along with others which hypothesized an appreciably increasing amount of seepage just prior to the failure, becomes less likely when it is compared against the eyewitness accounts of the conditions in the canyon and near the dam during the last thirty minutes before its collapse. Grunsky hypothesized, though failed to explain, the action of the dam tilting as he described. This action would have the dam in motion as a single unit while conversely, testimony given at the coroner&#x27;s inquest indicates that the dam was fractured transversely in at least four places. Furthermore, the two cracks, which bordered each side of the standing center section, would have served as hinges to prevent this.

== Aftermath ==


The center section of the St. Francis Dam, which had become known as &quot;The Tombstone&quot; due to a newspaper reporter&#x27;s description of it as such, became an attraction for tourists and souvenir hunters. It was toppled with dynamite in May 1929, and the remaining blocks were demolished with bulldozers and jackhammers to discourage exploration of the ruins by the public. The wing dike was used by Los Angeles firemen to gain experience in using explosives on building structures. The dam was not rebuilt, though Bouquet Reservoir in nearby Bouquet Canyon was built in 1934 as an early replacement, with additional capacity added with the completion of the Castaic Dam decades later in 1973.

The exact number of victims remains unknown. The official death toll in August 1928 was 385, but the remains of victims continued to be discovered every few years until the mid-1950s. Many victims were swept out to sea when the flood reached the Pacific Ocean and were never recovered, while others were washed ashore, some as far south as the Mexican border. The remains of one victim were found deep underground near Newhall in 1992, and other bodies, believed to be victims of the disaster, were found in the late 1970s and 1994. The death toll is currently estimated to be at least 431.

At the coroner&#x27;s inquest, the leak that Harnischfeger had spotted was cited as evidence that the dam was leaking on the day of the break, and that both Mulholland and the Bureau of Water Works and Supply were aware of it. Mulholland told the jury he had been at the dam the day of the break due to the dam keeper&#x27;s call, but neither he nor Van Norman had observed anything of concern, nor found any dangerous conditions. Mulholland further testified that leaks in dams, especially of the type and size of the St. Francis, were common. During the inquest Mulholland said, &quot;This inquest is a very painful thing for me to have to attend but it is the occasion of it that is painful. The only ones I envy about this thing are the ones who are dead.&quot; In subsequent testimony, after answering a question he added, &quot;Whether it is good or bad, don&#x27;t blame anyone else, you just fasten it on me. If there was an error in human judgment, I was the human, I won&#x27;t try to fasten it on anyone else.&quot;

The coroner&#x27;s inquest jury determined that one of the causative factors for the disaster lay in what they had termed as &quot;an error in engineering judgment in determining the foundation at the St. Francis Dam site and deciding on the best type of dam to build there&quot; and that &quot;the responsibility for the error in engineering judgment rests upon the Bureau of Water Works and Supply, and the Chief Engineer thereof.&quot; They cleared Mulholland as well as others of the Bureau of Water Works and Supply of any criminal culpability, since neither he nor anyone else at the time could have known of the instability of the rock formations on which the dam was built. The hearings also recommended that &quot;the construction and operation of a great dam should never be left to the sole judgment of one man, no matter how eminent.&quot;

Mulholland retired from the Bureau of Water Works and Supply on December 1, 1928. His assistant, Harvey Van Norman, succeeded him as chief engineer and general manager. Mulholland was retained as Chief Consulting Engineer, with an office, and received a salary of $500 a month. In later years, he retreated into a life of semi-isolation. Mulholland died in 1935, at the age of 79.

=== Dam safety legislation ===
In response to the St. Francis Dam disaster, the California legislature created an updated dam safety program and eliminated the municipal exemption. Before this was added, a municipality having its own engineering department was completely exempt from regulation.

On August 14, 1929, the Department of Public Works, under the administrative oversight of the State Engineer, which was later assumed by the Division of Safety of Dams, was given authority to review all non-federal dams over twenty-five feet high or which could hold more than fifty acre-feet of water. The new legislation also allowed the state to employ consultants, as they deemed necessary. Additionally, the state was given full authority to supervise the maintenance and operation of all non-federal dams.

=== Licensing of civil engineers ===
Having determined that the unregulated design of construction projects constituted a hazard to the public, the California legislature passed laws to regulate civil engineering and, in 1929, created the state Board of Registration for Civil Engineers (now the Board for Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, and Geologists).

== Analysis ==
At present, the popular hypothesis is that collapse may have begun with the eastern abutment of the dam giving way, possibly due to a landslide. This scenario, having its roots in the works of Willis and Grunsky, was expanded upon by the author Charles Outland in his 1963 book &quot;Man‑Made Disaster: The Story of St. Francis Dam&quot;. The material on which the eastern abutment of the dam had been built may itself have been part of an ancient landslide, but this would have been impossible for almost any geologists of the 1920s to detect. Indeed, the site had been inspected twice, at different times, by two of the leading geologists and civil engineers of the day, Grunsky and John C. Branner of Stanford University; neither found fault with the San Francisquito rock.

J. David Rogers, inspired by the work of Outland, investigated the failure and published an extensive scenario, albeit somewhat controversial, of the possible geological and rock mechanic actions which may have led to the dam&#x27;s failure. He attributed the failure to three major factors: the instability of the ancient landslide material on which the dam was built, the failure to compensate for the additional height added to the dam&#x27;s design, and the design and construction being overseen by only one person.

A critique of Rogers&#x27; historical analysis of the dam&#x27;s collapse was published in the journal &quot;California History&quot; in 2004 by historians Norris Hundley Jr. (Professor Emeritus, UCLA) and Donald C. Jackson (Professor, Lafayette College). While accepting most of his geological analysis of the failure, the article makes clearer the differences and deficiencies of the structure built in San Francisquito Canyon and how it fell short of the standards for large-scale concrete gravity dams as practiced by other prominent dam engineers in the 1920s.

== Mulholland Dam reinforcement ==
Shortly after the disaster, many living below Mulholland Dam, which creates the Hollywood Reservoir, feared a similar disaster and began to protest, petitioning the City of Los Angeles to drain the reservoir and remove the dam. A Committee of Engineers &amp; Geologists to Assess Mulholland Dam was appointed to evaluate the dam&#x27;s safety. An external review panel to evaluate the structure, convened by the State of California, followed in 1930. The same year, the City of Los Angeles Board of Water &amp; Power Commissioners appointed their own Board of Review for the dam. Although the state&#x27;s panel did not recommend modification of the dam, both panels came to similar conclusions: that the dam lacked what was then considered sufficient uplift relief, which could lead to destabilization, and was unacceptable. Again in 1931, a fourth panel, the Board of Engineers to Evaluate Mulholland Dam, was appointed to assess the structure. As well, an external study group appointed by the Board of Water &amp; Power Commissioners produced a &quot;Geological Report of the Suitability of Foundations&quot;. Certain design deficiencies were uncovered in the plans made by the engineering department during the planning phase of the dam. These had to do with the dam&#x27;s base width in conjunction to its ability to resist uplift and sliding and to withstand earthquake loading.

The decision was made to permanently keep the Hollywood Reservoir drawn down. It was also decided to keep the amount stored in the reservoir to no more than and to place an enormous amount of earth, , on the dam&#x27;s downstream face to increase its resistance against hydraulic uplift and earthquake forces, and to screen it from public view. This work was carried out in 1933–34.

== Legacy ==

The only visible remains of the St. Francis Dam are weathered, broken chunks of gray concrete and the rusted remnants of the handrails that lined the top of the dam and the wing dike. The ruins and the scar from the ancient landslide can be seen from San Francisquito Canyon Road. Large chunks of debris can still be found scattered about the creek bed south of the dam&#x27;s original site.

The site of the disaster is registered as California Historical Landmark #919. The landmark is located on the grounds of Powerhouse and is near San Francisquito Canyon Road. The marker reads:

NO. 919 ST. FRANCIS DAM DISASTER SITE – The 185-foot concrete St. Francis Dam, part of the Los Angeles aqueduct system, stood a mile and a half north of this spot. On March 12, 1928, just before midnight, it collapsed and sent over twelve billion gallons of water roaring down the valley of the Santa Clara River. Over 450 lives were lost in this, one of California&#x27;s greatest disasters.

San Francisquito Canyon Road sustained heavy storm damage in 2005, and when rebuilt in 2009 it was re-routed away from the original roadbed and the remains of the main section of the dam. The new road is routed through a cut which was made in the hillside on the western edge of the wing dike.

=== National Monument and National Memorial ===
The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, signed March 12, 2019, established the &quot;Saint Francis Dam Disaster National Monument&quot; and authorized the establishment of the &quot;Saint Francis Dam Disaster National Memorial&quot;. The sites will be administered by the United States Forest Service within Angeles National Forest to commemorate the collapse of the dam and preserve of land for recreation and protection of resources. Access to the Monument will be by foot via Old San Francisquito Canyon Road.

The St. Francis Dam National Memorial Foundation is a non-profit organization, established in 2019, with the goal of raising funds to support the United States Forest Service in building and maintaining the St. Francis Dam Disaster National Memorial and Monument, including the construction of a visitor center and a memorial wall with the names of all the identified victims. A winning memorial design was announced in April 2023.

== Documentaries ==
The rise of Mulholland, Los Angeles&#x27; water issues, and the collapse of the dam are dealt with in the 2018 documentary film, &quot;Forgotten Tragedy: The Story of The St Francis Dam&quot;, by Jesse Cash. 

The story of the dam&#x27;s construction and catastrophic failure is also the subject of the documentary &quot;Flood in the Desert&quot;, which was first broadcast in May 2022 as part of the &quot;American Experience&quot; series on PBS.

<doc id="425075" wikidata="Q6570140" url="?curid=425075" title="List of English homographs">
<text>Homographs are words with the same spelling but having more than one meaning. Homographs may be pronounced the same (homophones), or they may be pronounced differently (heteronyms, also known as heterophones).

Some homographs are nouns or adjectives when the accent is on the first syllable, and verbs when it is on the second. When the prefix &quot;re-&quot; is added to a monosyllabic word, the word gains currency both as a noun and as a verb.

Most of the pairs listed below are closely related: for example, &quot;absent&quot; as a noun meaning &quot;missing&quot;, and as a verb meaning &quot;to make oneself missing&quot;. There are also many cases in which homographs are of an entirely separate origin, or whose meanings have diverged to the point that present-day speakers have little historical understanding: for example, &quot;bat&quot;. Many, though not all of these, have first syllables that evolved from Latin. Also, some words only exhibit stress alternation in certain dialects of English. For a list of homographs with different pronunciations (heteronyms) see Heteronym (linguistics).

<doc id="425078" wikidata="Q137213" url="?curid=425078" title="Cercopoidea">
<text>The superfamily Cercopoidea, some members of which are called froghoppers and still others known as spittlebugs, are a group of hemipteran insects in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha. Adults are capable of jumping many times their height and length, giving the group their common name, but many species are best known for their plant-sucking nymphs which produce foam shelters, and are referred to as &quot;spittlebugs&quot;.

==Taxonomy==

Traditionally, most of this superfamily was considered a single family, the Cercopidae, but this family has been split into three families for many years now: the Aphrophoridae, Cercopidae, and Clastopteridae. The tribe Epipygini was removed from the Aphrophoridae and elevated to family rank in 2001, but four subsequent phylogenies all showed this lineage was firmly nested within Aphrophoridae (e.g.). More recently, in 2023, a phylogenetic analysis concluded that Cercopidae was not monophyletic, with the New World lineages representing the sister taxon to all other cercopoids, and accordingly raised from subfamily to family status as Ischnorhinidae in order to keep all of the cercopoid families monophyletic.

==Spittlebug nymphs==
These families are best known for the nymphal stage, which produces a cover of foamed-up plant sap visually resembling saliva; the nymphs are therefore commonly known as spittlebugs and their foam as cuckoo spit, frog spit, or snake spit. This characteristic spittle production is associated with the unusual trait of xylem feeding. Whereas most insects that feed on sap feed on the nutrient-rich fluid from the phloem, Cercopidae utilize the much more dilute sap flowing upward from the roots via the xylem. The large amount of excess water that must be excreted and the evolution of special breathing tubes allow the young spittlebug nymphs to grow in the relatively protective environment of the spittle. Normally an animal should not be able to survive on a diet so low in nutrients, but the insects&#x27; digestive system contains symbiotic bacteria that provide them with the essential amino acids.

The foam serves a number of purposes. It hides the nymph from the view of predators and parasites, and it insulates against heat and cold, thus providing thermal control and also moisture control; without the foam, the insect would risk dehydration. The nymphs pierce plants and suck sap causing very little damage; much of the filtered fluids go into the production of the foam, which has an acrid taste, deterring predators. A few species are serious agricultural pests.

A small family in the group, the Machaerotidae, known as the tube spittlebugs, is an outlier among the Cercopoidea because the nymphs live in calcareous tubes rather than producing foam as in the other families.

==Adults==
Adult froghoppers jump from plant to plant; some species can jump up to vertically: a more impressive performance relative to body weight than fleas. The froghopper can accelerate at over as it jumps (experiencing over 400 gs of acceleration). Spittlebugs can jump 100 times their own length.

Many species of froghopper resemble leafhoppers, but can be distinguished by the possession of only a few stout spines on the hind tibiae, where leafhoppers have a series of small spines. Members of the family Machaerotidae greatly resemble treehoppers, due to a large thoracic spine, but the spine in machaerotids is an enlargement of the scutellum, where treehoppers have the pronotum enlarged. Members of the family Clastopteridae have their wings modified to form false heads at the tail end, an antipredator adaptation. Many adult Cercopidae can bleed reflexively from their tarsi, and the hemolymph appears to be distasteful; they are often aposematically colored.

== Evolutionary history ==
The oldest froghoppers are known from the Early Jurassic. Mesozoic froghoppers are divided into two main families, Procercopidae known from the Early Jurassic to early Late Cretaceous of Asia, which are thought to be ancestral to living froghoppers, and Sinoalidae, which is known from the late Middle Jurassic and early Late Cretaceous of Asia. The genus &quot;Qibinius&quot; the Middle Jurassic Yanan Formation of China mixes characters of both families and cannot be assigned to either. The genus &quot;Cercopion&quot; from the Aptian aged Crato Formation of Brazil appears to be derived from the Procerocopidae and closely related to the crown group.

<doc id="425080" wikidata="Q1008803" url="?curid=425080" title="Federal Territories of Malaysia">
<text>The Federal Territories (FT), () in Malaysia comprise three territories—Kuala Lumpur, Labuan, and Putrajaya—governed directly by the Federal Government of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur is the national capital of Malaysia, Putrajaya is the administrative capital, and Labuan is an offshore international financial centre. Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya are enclaves in the state of Selangor. Labuan is an island off the coast of Sabah.

==Administrations==
The territories fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Federal Territories. Originally, the Federal Territory (FT) Ministry was established in 1979 and was in charge of planning and administration of Kuala Lumpur and Klang Valley. In 1981, the FT Ministry was re-established under the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department as the Planning Unit of Klang Valley. In 2004, the FT Ministry was again formed into a full-fledged ministry which focused on the development of Kuala Lumpur, Labuan and Putrajaya. In 2022, under Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim&#x27;s administration, the ministry was scrapped and its functions delegated to other ministries. Currently, the Federal Territories are administered by the Department of the Federal Territories (Jabatan Wilayah Persekutuan) under the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department.

==History==
The federal territories were originally part of two states: Selangor and Sabah. Both Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya were part of Selangor and Labuan was part of Sabah.

Kuala Lumpur, the state capital of Selangor, became the national capital of the Federation of Malaya (and later Malaysia) in 1948. Since independence in 1957, the federal as well as the Selangor state ruling party had been the Alliance (later the Barisan Nasional). However, in the 1969 elections the Alliance, while retaining control of the federal government, lost its majority in Selangor to the opposition. The same election resulted in a major race riot in Kuala Lumpur.

It was realised that if Kuala Lumpur remained part of Selangor, clashes between the federal government and Selangor state government might arise when they are controlled by different parties. The solution was to separate Kuala Lumpur from the state and place it under direct federal rule. On 1 February 1974, the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur Agreement was signed, and Kuala Lumpur became the first federal territory of Malaysia.

The cession of Kuala Lumpur had the effect of securing the Selangor state government for the Barisan Nasional until the 2008 general election. The separation of Kuala Lumpur meant that Kuala Lumpur voters lost representation in the Selangor State Legislative Assembly and could only vote for representation in the Parliament of Malaysia.

Labuan, an island off coast of mainland Sabah, was chosen by the federal government for development into an offshore financial centre. Labuan became the second federal territory in 16 April 1984.

Putrajaya is a planned city, designed to replace Kuala Lumpur as the seat of the federal government. Sultan Salahuddin of Selangor, who was serving as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong at that time, was asked again to cede land to the federal government. Putrajaya became the third federal territory on 1 February 2001.

In recent years, efforts were made to forge a common identity for the three federal territories. A flag of the Federal Territories was introduced in 2006 to represent the federal territories as a whole. During the 2006 Sukma Games in Kedah, Kuala Lumpur, Labuan, and Putrajaya&#x27;s teams merged into the unified Federal Territories team.

==Symbols==

Maju dan Sejahtera () is the official anthem of the Federal Territories.

Apart from the flag of Federal Territories, each federal territory has its own flag.

==Sports==
Since 2006, sport activities in all three Federal Territories are governed and coordinated by the Federal Territory Sports Council (, WIPERS), a federal statutory body.

==Holidays==

In addition to federal public holidays, all three Federal Territories celebrate Federal Territory Day. Labuan, with a significant Kadazan-Dusun community, celebrates Kaamatan with the neighbouring state of Sabah.

== Federal Parliament seats ==
The Federal Territories representatives in the Federal Parliament (Dewan Rakyat) since the 15th general election are:

<doc id="425087" wikidata="Q1473092" url="?curid=425087" title="Uncle Tupelo">
<text>Uncle Tupelo was an alternative country music group from Belleville, Illinois, active between 1987 and 1994. Jay Farrar, Jeff Tweedy, and Mike Heidorn formed the band after the lead singer of their previous band, The Primitives, left to attend college. The trio recorded three albums for Rockville Records, before signing with Sire Records and expanding to a five-piece. Shortly after the release of the band&#x27;s major label debut album &quot;Anodyne&quot;, Farrar announced his decision to leave the band due to a soured relationship with his co-songwriter Tweedy. Uncle Tupelo split on May 1, 1994, after completing a farewell tour. Following the breakup, Farrar formed Son Volt with Heidorn, while the remaining members continued as Wilco.

Although Uncle Tupelo broke up before it achieved commercial success, the band is renowned for its impact on the alternative country music scene. The group&#x27;s first album, &quot;No Depression&quot;, became a byword for the genre and was widely influential. Uncle Tupelo&#x27;s sound was unlike popular country music of the time, drawing inspiration from styles as diverse as the hardcore punk of Minutemen and the country instrumentation and harmony of the Carter Family and Hank Williams. Farrar and Tweedy&#x27;s lyrics frequently referred to Middle America and the working class of Belleville.

== History ==

=== The Plebes and The Primitives ===
Jay Farrar, along with his brothers Wade and Dade, played in an early 1980s garage band named The Plebes. Hailing from Belleville, Illinois, The Plebes sought to enter a battle-of-the-bands competition but needed another high school student as a member to perform. They invited Jeff Tweedy, a high school friend of Jay Farrar, to join the band and play with them for the show. Despite a lack of skill with his instrument, Tweedy played an important role in the band by booking early gigs. While The Plebes had been playing music in a rockabilly style, Tweedy wanted to play punk rock like the music that he originally heard the group perform. This caused tensions between Tweedy and Dade Farrar, who left the band two months after Tweedy joined.

Before leaving the band in 1984, Dade Farrar introduced its members to Mike Heidorn, the younger brother of his girlfriend; Heidorn then joined the group as their drummer. The Plebes then decided to change its name to The Primitives, a reference to a 1965 song by psychedelic rock group The Groupies. Due to the unpopularity of punk rock in the St. Louis area, The Primitives began to play blues-oriented garage rock at fast tempos. They performed regularly at a wedding hall in Millstadt, Illinois, where Tweedy&#x27;s mother Jo Ann would collect the cover fee. They also performed regularly at B St Bar in Belleville with bands such as The Newsboys (later Sammy and the Snowmonkeys), Charlie Langrehr, and The Symptoms. Wade Farrar was the lead singer of the band, but his commitment to Southern Illinois University and an attempted enlistment in the United States Army meant he was only able to dedicate a small amount of time to the group. Additionally, Heidorn broke his collarbone during a concert in 1986, which caused the band to go on hiatus. Jay Farrar and Tweedy continued to write songs and perform at Heidorn&#x27;s house while he recovered, and by 1987 they had restarted the group. The Primitives temporarily added Tony Mayr as a bassist so that Tweedy could play guitar, but a month later the band decided to keep Tweedy on bass and remain a three-piece. To avoid confusion with a successful British band also named The Primitives, they decided to change their name once again, to Uncle Tupelo. Although they performed only 1960s cover songs as The Primitives, the trio decided to take a new approach and write their own music under their new name.

=== As Uncle Tupelo ===

The Primitives renamed themselves Uncle Tupelo, a name created by combining two randomly chosen words from the dictionary. Inspired by the name, cartoonist Chuck Wagner, a friend of the band, created a character resembling an old, fat Elvis Presley. The trio recorded a four-song demo tape, which got them supporting slots opening for headline artists such as Johnny Thunders and Warren Zevon. Tweedy met Tony Margherita while working as a clerk at Euclid Records in St. Louis. After attending two of the band&#x27;s shows, Margherita offered to become their manager. Uncle Tupelo began to play regular shows at Cicero&#x27;s Basement — a bar close to the campus of Washington University in St. Louis. Bands playing in a similar style, including Brian Henneman&#x27;s group Chicken Truck, often played at the venue, which by late 1988 was considered the locus of a new music scene. The band temporarily expanded to a four-piece with the addition of the guitarist Alex Mutrux, but soon reverted to a trio.

Uncle Tupelo recorded demo tracks in the attic studio of future Chicago punk producer Matt Allison in Champaign, Illinois. The demo, distributed with the title &quot;Not Forever, Just for Now&quot;, includes &quot;I Got Drunk&quot; and &quot;Screen Door&quot;, as well as early versions of several other songs that would appear on the band&#x27;s first studio album. The &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; gave the tape a rave review, and called Uncle Tupelo the best unsigned band of the year. The accolade drew the attention of independent labels, and the band decided to sign with Jay Fialkov and Debbie Southwood-Smith of Giant Records, who offered to book them at CBGB in New York City. Explaining the decision, the band said that &quot;[our] original goals don&#x27;t get distorted with an independent label.&quot;

=== Recordings on Rockville Records ===

Shortly after Uncle Tupelo&#x27;s signing, Giant Records changed its name to Rockville Records. The band&#x27;s first album for Rockville, &quot;No Depression&quot;, was recorded over ten days in January 1990, at Fort Apache South recording studio in Boston, Massachusetts. The album&#x27;s thematic structure revolved around their lives as adolescents in Belleville; examples are songs about wanting to avoid factory work and songs about fearing a potential Persian Gulf War military draft. Impressed by their previous work on Dinosaur Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Bug&quot;, the band wanted Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade to produce the album. Slade let Farrar play on the same 1961 Gibson Les Paul SG Junior that J. Mascis originally played on &quot;Bug&quot;. The album was released on June 21, 1990, and the band celebrated by playing at Cicero&#x27;s for two nights.

In between tours, Farrar, Tweedy and Heidorn formed a country cover band named Coffee Creek, along with Brian Henneman (later a member of The Bottle Rockets). Henneman impressed Uncle Tupelo, and he was invited to be a guitar technician and occasional multi-instrumentalist for the band. While Farrar and Heidorn would avoid drinking too much after shows, Tweedy would continue drinking throughout the night. Although Tweedy stopped after he began dating Sue Miller in 1991, a significant communication gap had already been opened between Tweedy and Farrar.

By March 1991, &quot;No Depression&quot; had sold an estimated 15,000 copies, and was featured in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article about rising stars. However, Rockville Records refused to pay the band any royalties for the album, a theme that would continue for the remainder of the band&#x27;s contract. Over seventeen days the band recorded a second album at Long View Farm in rural North Brookfield, Massachusetts. &quot;Still Feel Gone&quot;, with a more layered sound, was also produced by Kolderie and Slade, with contributions by Slade, Henneman, Rich Gilbert, Chris Bess of Enormous Richard, and Gary Louris of The Jayhawks. The band was disappointed with the production of the album and decided to discontinue working with Kolderie and Slade. Soon afterward, Uncle Tupelo recorded &quot;Shaking Hands (Soldier&#x27;s Joy)&quot; on Michelle Shocked&#x27;s album &quot;Arkansas Traveler&quot; and joined her on the accompanying tour with Taj Mahal and The Band. However, the tour only lasted for a few shows because of managerial problems between Shocked and The Band.

Alternative rock had broken into the mainstream by 1992, and an album released in that style was expected to earn the group a major-label record deal. However, Uncle Tupelo did not want to follow in the footsteps of groups such as Nirvana, and decided to play country and folk songs &quot;as a big &#x27;fuck you&#x27; to the rock scene&quot;. Peter Buck, guitarist for R.E.M., saw the trio perform at the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Georgia and sought them out after the show. Buck was impressed with a version of &quot;Atomic Power&quot; that the band played, and offered his services for their next album. Over a span of five days, Buck produced the group&#x27;s next album, &quot;March 16–20, 1992&quot;. Buck allowed them to stay in his house during the sessions, and charged no money for his services. Henneman&#x27;s role was increased for this album, and he taught himself how to play mandolin and bouzouki. Despite turning away from the style of popular alternative rock, major labels began to show significant interest in Uncle Tupelo after &quot;March 16–20, 1992&quot; was released. The album sold more than their two previous recordings combined, although Rockville was displeased that it did not conform to the style of popular alternative rock.

=== Major label contract ===
In 1992, Joe McEwen of Sire Records began to pursue the band. McEwen, who brought notable acts such as Dinosaur Jr. and Shawn Colvin to Sire, had been interested in them since hearing the &quot;Not Forever, Just for Now&quot; demo tape. At the urging of Gary Louris, McEwen offered Uncle Tupelo a contract. Band manager Tony Margherita invoked the $50,000 escape clause he had put in their Rockville contract, freeing the band to sign a seven-year deal with Sire. The deal required two albums and specified a budget of $150,000 for the first.

Around the time of the recording of &quot;March 16–20, 1992&quot;, Mike Heidorn had secured a steady job at a Belleville newspaper company and was dating a woman who had two children from a previous marriage. Uncle Tupelo had planned a tour of Europe, but Heidorn wanted to stay in Belleville with his girlfriend, whom he married in August 1992.

The band held auditions prior to the promotional tour for &quot;March 16–20, 1992&quot;, and two candidates stood out: Bill Belzer and Ken Coomer. Although Farrar and Tweedy agreed that Coomer was the better drummer, they were intimidated by his six-foot-four stature and long dreadlocks. The band instead selected Belzer as Heidorn&#x27;s replacement, but he only stayed with the band for six months. Tweedy explained Belzer&#x27;s departure:

I want to believe it was purely musical, and I honestly believe that it wasn&#x27;t working musically. I also believe that we weren&#x27;t emotionally mature enough to be close friends with a gay person at that point in our lives ... And Bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person, very open about his homosexuality.

After touring Europe opening for Sugar, the band replaced Belzer with Coomer. The band also experimented with new members: John Stirratt replaced Brian Henneman (who left to form The Bottle Rockets) while Max Johnston, the brother of Michelle Shocked, joined as a live mandolin and violin performer. Stirratt became the full-time bassist, allowing Tweedy to perform more songs with the guitar.

Now a five-piece, Uncle Tupelo recorded their major label debut at Cedar Creek studio in Austin, Texas in early 1993. &quot;Anodyne&quot; consisted of live-in-the-studio recordings and included a duet with Farrar and Doug Sahm of the Sir Douglas Quintet. The album sold 150,000 copies, and was their only entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart. The group toured until the end of the year, finishing with a sold-out concert at Tramps in New York City. Because of their concert draw, major executives at Sire began to see the band as a potential hit.

In 1993, the band contributed a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s track &quot;Effigy&quot; to the AIDS-Benefit album &quot;No Alternative&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization.

=== Breakup ===
With the addition of Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston just prior to the recording of &quot;Anodyne&quot;, Farrar and Tweedy&#x27;s relationship became more tumultuous, leading to verbal altercations after concerts. In one account, Tweedy recalled:

Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, &quot;Don&#x27;t you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.&quot; He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn&#x27;t have to be so fucking afraid anymore.

Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy&#x27;s new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar&#x27;s girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and did not want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: &quot;It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren&#x27;t compatible. It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record.&quot;

Tweedy was enraged that he heard the news secondhand from Margherita, rather than directly from Farrar. The following day, the two engaged in a verbal confrontation. As a favor to Margherita, who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running, Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America. Tweedy and Farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour, due to Farrar&#x27;s refusal to sing harmony on any of Tweedy&#x27;s songs. The band made its first appearance on national television during the tour when they were featured on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Sire had requested that the band perform &quot;The Long Cut&quot; on the show, which further irked Farrar since the song was written and sung by Tweedy.

Uncle Tupelo&#x27;s last concerts, two shows at The Blue Note in Columbia, Missouri and two shows at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis, took place from April 28 to May 1, 1994. A special &quot;last leg&quot; poster was created for the occasion which facetiously promoted the band as &quot;St. Louis&#x27;s 4th best country band&quot;, based on a readers&#x27; poll in the Riverfront Times. On the last night, Tweedy and Farrar each performed nine songs during the concert, and Mike Heidorn performed as drummer during the encore.

=== Post-breakup ===

Following Uncle Tupelo&#x27;s final tour, Tweedy encouraged his bandmates to join him in a new group, while Farrar searched for members for a band of his own. Tweedy was able to retain the rest of the Uncle Tupelo lineup, and created Wilco. They began rehearsing a few days after the final Uncle Tupelo concert, and by August 1994 they were in the recording studio for their first album, &quot;A.M.&quot;. Farrar asked Jim Boquist to join his new band, Son Volt; Boquist was a multi-instrumentalist who had performed with Joe Henry as the opening act on Uncle Tupelo&#x27;s last tour. Boquist also recruited his brother Dave, and Farrar convinced Mike Heidorn to leave Belleville to join the group. Farrar&#x27;s new four-piece began recording their debut album &quot;Trace&quot; in November 1994.

Wilco signed to Reprise Records while Son Volt signed with Warner Bros. Records. Son Volt had an early college rock hit with &quot;Drown&quot; from the album &quot;Trace&quot;, but Wilco maintained a more commercially successful career in the years to follow. Regarding the possibility of a reunion, Mike Heidorn reported in a PopMatters interview that &quot;nothing&#x27;s ever for sure, but I would have to say, &#x27;No such thing&#x27;.&quot; Farrar said that he does not want the band to get back together, while Tweedy said that he believes that a reunion would not be productive musically.

Farrar and Tweedy sued Rockville Records and Dutch East India Trading CEO Barry Tenenbaum in 2000 over royalties that the label allegedly owed them, winning restitution from Tenenbaum and the joint rights to Uncle Tupelo&#x27;s first three albums. After securing the rights, the band released a compilation entitled &quot;89/93: An Anthology&quot;. In 2003, Uncle Tupelo re-issued their first three albums, which before the lawsuit had cumulatively sold over 200,000 copies.

== Influences ==
As The Primitives, Tweedy and Farrar were highly influenced by punk bands such as The Ramones and The Sex Pistols. However, they began to listen to country music because punk rock was not well received in the Belleville and St. Louis music scenes. While they originally were introduced to country by their parents, it was not until this time that they began to listen to it for leisure. Farrar typically wrote songs about Middle America, while Tweedy wrote about more mainstream topics such as relationships. Farrar took influence from authors such as Kurt Vonnegut and Jack Kerouac, whom he read while working at his mother&#x27;s bookstore. As a singer, Farrar&#x27;s lyrics would be front-and-center during performances, but the band&#x27;s musical style was mostly driven by Tweedy and Heidorn. Jeff Tweedy said in an interview with the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;:

We probably have more influences than we know what to do with. We have two main styles that have been influences. For instance, we like Black Flag as much as early Bob Dylan and Dinosaur Jr. as much as Hank Williams... To us, hard-core punk is also folk music. We draw a close parallel between the two. We&#x27;ll play both in the same set if we get a chance. We don&#x27;t have any biases as far as music is concerned.

Tweedy in particular was inspired by the Minutemen, and wrote a song about D. Boon following Boon&#x27;s death in a van accident. The band has released songs originally performed by Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Carter Family, Lead Belly, Gram Parsons, The Soft Boys, The Louvin Brothers, Texas Tornados, and The Stooges. Releasing &quot;March 16–20, 1992&quot; when alternative music was breaking through was a move inspired by Neil Young&#x27;s decision to release the challenging albums &quot;On the Beach&quot; and &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; immediately after the commercially successful &quot;Harvest&quot;. Critic Michael Corcoran likened the band&#x27;s musical style to &quot;Bob Mould fronting Soul Asylum on a speeded-up version of a Gram Parsons song.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Uncle Tupelo is credited as one of the founders of the alternative country genre, a blend of alternative rock and traditional country music. While the genre eventually became associated with solo artists such as Gram Parsons and Lyle Lovett, Uncle Tupelo is considered the first alternative country band. Some media outlets like the BBC have even suggested that they were the genre&#x27;s sole creator. However, Tweedy and Heidorn dispute this claim, and Farrar says that there is no difference between alternative country and other genres such as roots rock. Heidorn commented in a Country Standard Time interview:

It&#x27;s strange to hear Uncle Tupelo mentioned because what we were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early &#x27;60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn&#x27;t start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That&#x27;s the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.

The band&#x27;s first three albums influenced contemporary roots rock artists such as Richmond Fontaine and Whiskeytown. Uncle Tupelo&#x27;s usage of distorted guitars to play a style of music that was known for its earnestness became a lasting trend in 1990s modern rock. Jason Ankeny wrote in AllMusic that:

With the release of their 1990 debut LP, &quot;No Depression&quot;, the Belleville, IL, trio Uncle Tupelo launched more than simply their own career—by fusing the simplicity and honesty of country music with the bracing fury of punk, they kick-started a revolution which reverberated throughout the American underground.

Their 1990 album &quot;No Depression&quot; lent its name to an influential alternative country periodical. Due to the influence of the album and periodical, the term &quot;No Depression&quot; became a byword for alternative country—particularly for bands with punk rock influence. The alternative country movement played an important role in the success of future traditionalist country acts such as Robbie Fulks and Shelby Lynne.

<text>USS &quot;Parsons&quot; (DD-949/DDG-33) began her career as a &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot;-class destroyer of the United States Navy. She was named in honor of Rear Admiral William S. Parsons (1901–1953), who worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II.

&quot;Parsons&quot;&#x27; keel was laid down 17 June 1957 by Ingalls Shipbuilding of Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was launched on 17 August 1959, sponsored by Mrs. William S. Parsons, and commissioned 29 October 1959 at Charleston, South Carolina.

== History ==

After shakedown, &quot;Parsons&quot; reported to her home port, San Diego, California, and commenced operations with the First Fleet in February 1960. In October she deployed to the Western Pacific with Seventh Fleet units. She returned to resume West Coast operations in July 1961 and entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 6 October for major improvements in her communications and antisubmarine warfare (ASW) equipment. She then rejoined the First Fleet in extensive coastal training from January to November 1962, deployed for her second WestPac tour in November, and returned in July 1963 to the California coast.

Under the command of Cdr. Jack Jester, USN, during the summer and fall of 1963 she carried out AAW and ASW operations in the San Diego, California area. During November she escorted &quot;Midway&quot; (CVA-41) and &quot;Hancock&quot; (CVA-19) to the Western Pacific and returned to San Diego. During the summer of 1965, &quot;Parsons&quot; visited San Francisco, Puget Sound, and Hawaii as part of the Pacific Midshipman Training Squadron. &quot;Parsons&quot; continued her training and service operations alternately with First Fleet and Seventh Fleet until she was decommissioned at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 19 January 1966.

&quot;Parsons&quot; was one of four &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot;-class destroyers selected for conversion from all-gun destroyers to the new &quot;Decatur&quot; class of guided missile destroyer. The others were &quot;Decatur&quot; (DD-936/DDG-31), &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; (DD-932/DDG-32), and &quot;Somers&quot; (DD-947/DDG-34). &quot;Parsons&quot; was assigned hull classification symbol DDG-33 on 15 March 1967, recommissioned 3 November 1967, and assigned to the Cruiser-Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet. Following shakedown she carried out a rigorous testing program for her missile systems, and in September 1968 she assumed duties as flagship for Destroyer Squadron 31 (DesRon 31) and immediately deployed to the Western Pacific for operations with the Seventh Fleet off Vietnam. Interspersed with her aircraft carrier escort duties on Yankee Station, she conducted on-station training operations, assuming duties as ASW training coordinator ship with Commander Destroyer Squadron 31 (ComDesRon 31) embarked. &quot;Parsons&quot; also visited Kaohsiung, Yokosuka, Hong Kong, Singapore and Sasebo. She returned to San Diego, California, on 12 May 1969 to resume operations from there and train for her next deployment.

The conversion removed both of the after 5 in (127 mm) 54-caliber gun mounts and installed one AN/SPG-51C Missile Fire Control System (MFCS), one Mk.13 Guided Missile Launching System (GMLS), one Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC) system, and modified the Gun Fire Control System to accommodate an illuminator to provide a second missile capable Gun/Missile Fire Control System (G/MFCS). The ship could then engage two air targets simultaneously (one with each FCS) using from two to four Tartar medium-range, less than 20 nautical mile (37 km) missiles, depending upon the engagement policy in force (Shoot-Look-Shoot or Shoot-Shoot-Look).

The forward five-inch/54-caliber gun mount was retained as were the torpedo tubes. The 5 in (127 mm) 54-caliber gun was, nominally, a rapid-fire mount capable of firing over 30 rounds per minute at targets up to ranges of 12 nautical miles (22 km). The torpedo launchers each held three Mk46 torpedoes, for use only against submarines.

The conversion created a unique ship, but one that never found a unique role. In the long run, one of the ship&#x27;s best capabilities, convoy escort, was taken over by the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; class.

After conversion, &quot;Parsons&quot; was homeported in San Diego, California, from re-activation until late 1971, when the ship, as part of Destroyer Squadron 15 (DesRon 15), was forward deployed to Yokosuka, Japan. As part of this movement, the families of all eligible crewmen were transported to Japan, where they lived in U.S. Navy Housing, located in both the Yokosuka and Yokohama areas.

From December 1971 through December 1972, &quot;Parsons&quot; provided support to forces afloat and ashore involved in the Vietnam War by operating as:

* Naval Gunfire Support (NGFS) unit in both I and IV Corps areas, with the vast majority of operating time spent very close to the DMZ, supporting Marines in that area.
* Search and Rescue (SAR) unit (or escort when a DLG held the SAR position) at both the North (N-SAR) and South (S-SAR) stations in the northern Tonkin Gulf. This station provided a means to rescue downed U.S. pilots.
* Carrier escort on Yankee Station.

&quot;Parsons&quot; left Vietnam for the last time on or around 19 December 1974.

On 29 October 1980 she rescued 111 Vietnamese refugees 330 miles south of Saigon.

DDG operations ranged from Anti-Aircraft Warfare (AAW) to Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) to Anti-Surface Warfare (SUW) and Naval Gunfire Support (NFGS) and included, as necessary, Electronic Warfare (EW).

==Fate==
&quot;Parsons&quot; was decommissioned on 19 November 1982. She was stricken from the Navy Directory on 1 December 1984, and finally disposed of as a target on 25 April 1989.

<doc id="425104" wikidata="Q249114" url="?curid=425104" title="Salsa (food)">
<text>Salsa encompasses a variety of sauces used as condiments for tacos and other Mexican and Mexican-American foods, and as dips for tortilla chips. They may be raw or cooked, and are generally served at room temperature.

Though the word &quot;salsa&quot; means any kind of sauce in Spanish, in English, it refers specifically to these Mexican table sauces, especially to the chunky tomato-and-chili-based pico de gallo, as well as to salsa verde.

Tortilla chips with salsa are a ubiquitous appetizer in Mexican-American restaurants, but not in Mexico itself.

==History==
The use of salsa as a table dip was popularized by Mexican restaurants in the United States. In the 1980s, tomato-based Mexican-style salsas gained in popularity. In 1992, the dollar value of salsa sales in the United States exceeded those of tomato ketchup.

Tomato-based salsas later found competition from salsas made with fruit, corn, or black beans. Since the 2000s sweet salsas combining fruits with peppers like habanero, Scotch bonnet and datil have grown in popularity and are served with frozen dessert, cheesecakes, and pound cakes. In the United States, salsa is used in marinades, salad dressings, stews, and cooked sauces. In addition to accompanying various fish, poultry, and meat dishes, it is also used as a condiment for baked potatoes, pasta dishes, and pizza.

==Types==

Salsa is a common ingredient in Mexican cuisine, served as a condiment with tacos, stirred into soups and stews, or incorporated into tamale fillings. Salsa fresca is fresh salsa made with tomatoes and hot peppers. Salsa verde is made with cooked tomatillos and is served as a dip or sauce for chilaquiles, enchiladas, and other dishes. Chiltomate is a widely used base sauce made of tomatoes and chiles. The type of pepper used for chiltomate varies by region, with fresh green chiles being more common than habanero in Chiapas. Tamales are often identified according to the type of salsa they are filled with, either salsa verde, salsa roja, salsa de rajas, or salsa de mole.

Mexican &quot;salsas&quot; were traditionally produced using the mortar and pestle–like &quot;molcajete&quot;, although blenders are now used. Mexican &quot;salsas&quot; include:
* &quot;Salsa roja&quot;, one of the two most common and well known types of salsa, &quot;red sauce&quot;, is used as a condiment in Mexican and Southwestern (U.S.) cuisines; usually includes cooked tomatoes, chili peppers, onion, garlic, and fresh cilantro (coriander).
* &quot;Salsa cruda&quot;, &quot;raw sauce&quot;, is an uncooked mixture of chopped tomatoes, onions, jalapeño chilies, and cilantro.

==Importance of proper storage==

The WHO says care should be taken in the preparation and storage of &quot;salsa&quot; and any other types of sauces, since many raw-served varieties can act as growth media for potentially dangerous bacteria, especially when unrefrigerated.

In 2002, a study by the University of Texas–Houston found sauces contaminated with &quot;E. coli&quot; in:
* 66% of the sauces from restaurants tested in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico
* 40% of those from restaurants tested in Houston, Texas

In 2010, the CDC reported that 1 in 25 foodborne illnesses between 1998 and 2008 was traced back to restaurant sauces (carelessly prepared or stored).

A 2010 paper on salsa food hygiene described refrigeration as &quot;the key&quot; to safe sauces. This study also found that fresh lime juice (add for a salsa pH of 3.6) and fresh garlic (but not powdered garlic) combined would prevent the growth of Salmonella.

<text>The Joint University Programmes Admissions System (), commonly known as JUPAS (), is a unified system for applying for full-time undergraduate programmes in Hong Kong. As of the 2017 admission cycle, all government funded degrees and sub-degrees provided by University Grants Committee (UGC) member institutions, and most of the other full-time degrees provided by institutions in Hong Kong are under the application system in JUPAS.

==History==
Prior to the introduction of JUPAS in 1990, the admission processes of tertiary education institutes were independent of one another and two separate entrance examinations were provided for students. The Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination (HKALE), which was designed for a three-year tertiary education curriculum, was mainly used by the University of Hong Kong (HKU); while the Hong Kong Higher Level Examination (HKHLE), which was designed for a four-year tertiary education curriculum, was mainly used by The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).

To reduce students&#x27; pressure of dealing with two examinations and admission processes, the University Grants Committee set up the JUPAS to unite the admission processes of five of the institutions (HKU, CUHK, City Polytechnic of Hong Kong, The Hong Kong Polytechnic Institute, and the Hong Kong Baptist University). The UGC also selected the HKALE to be the benchmark examination; the HKHLE then came to its end in 1992, two years after the introduction of JUPAS.

The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, The Hong Kong Institute of Education, and Lingnan University, institutions directly under the UGC which were established after the introduction of JUPAS, joined the scheme in 1991, 1996, and 1999, respectively.

As being an alternative of students who want to pursue their undergraduate education with a lesser result due to the high competitiveness of JUPAS (see below), all government-funded sub-degree programmes provided by JUPAS member institutes have been managed under JUPAS since the 2000 admission cycle.

In the 2006 admission cycle, the Open University of Hong Kong, which provided self-financed degrees, also participated in the scheme. The Hong Kong Shue Yan University was also being offered to participate in JUPAS, but they declined, seeking to maintain an independent admissions process.
As part of educational reform in Hong Kong, the HKALE came to its end in 2012 (though it accepted retakers in 2013), replaced by the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE). The UGC continued JUPAS as the admissions system of their member institutions. In the 2011 admissions cycle, JUPAS began accepting applications from students taking the HKDSE.

==Benchmark examinations==
Since JUPAS itself is a system, not an admission examination nor process, JUPAS can collect academic results from student for the references of admissions-related personals in member institutions. Theoretically, all recognised international academic examinations involving in the world are considered in admission into JUPAS, but the Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination (HKALE), and/or the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE, launching in academic year 2011) is a must for every student. No applicant can participate in JUPAS without a valid HKALE or HKDSE result obtained in the same or previous years in which the applicant apply for JUPAS. The aforementioned examination results are considered the most important factor of admission in all programmes in almost all situations (other than the now-defunct Early Admissions Scheme).

Even without being mentioned, before the introduction of HKDSE, the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE) was almost a must for every student since almost every student taking part in the HKALE took part in the HKCEE. HKCEE results were usually considered as an important factor in admissions, and usually were a requirement of admission in most cases. Apart from the above examinations, the two International English benchmark examinations, the TOEFL and the IELTS, play important roles in some situations (including being a minimum admission requirement), through most of the cases it is considered unessential.

==Participating institutes and courses==
In 2016/17 academic year, the following programmes are offered under JUPAS:
#All government-funded full-time degrees/full-time degrees and sub-degree programmes (indicated with asterisk(*)) offered by University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded institutes:
#*City University of Hong Kong (*)
#* Hong Kong Baptist University
#* Lingnan University
#* The Chinese University of Hong Kong
#* The Education University of Hong Kong (*)
#* The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (*)
#* The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
#* The University of Hong Kong
#Selected Self-financed full-time degrees offered by Hong Kong Metropolitan University
#Study Subsidy Scheme for Designated Professions (SSSDP) degrees offered by following institutes:
#* Saint Francis University
#* Chu Hai College of Higher Education
#* Hang Seng University of Hong Kong
#* Tung Wah College
#* Hong Kong Metropolitan University
#* Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education (including Technological and Higher Education Institute of Hong Kong)

JUPAS applicants do not need to and are not allowed to apply for any undergraduate programmes directly to the member institutions on their own as long as the programme is available by JUPAS. In such cases, JUPAS applications will always have the first priority and will void all other direct applications automatically. However, this restriction does not apply if programmes itself is not available in JUPAS.

Applications of programmes provided by institutes with no association to JUPAS (e.g. Hong Kong Shue Yan University or community colleges associated with UGC-funded institutes) are independent of the JUPAS system. Applicants of those programmes are required to apply directly to the institutes in question.

Non-Form 6 students who are not currently studying degrees provided by JUPAS, including students studying JUPAS&#x27; non-degree programmes, may apply for JUPAS as long as they met the HKDSE requirement or will participate HKDSE in same academic year to meet the requirement. Students studying in secondary schools approved by the Education Bureau can only apply for the above programmes through JUPAS.

==Application process==
Applicants applying through JUPAS can select up to 20 choices of any programme offered by the 9 local institutes via the online portal, provided that they satisfied the prerequisites. The application form is sub-divided into different bandings, namely bands A, B, C, D, and E. Putting choices in different bands will affect the scoring of the applicants in the JUPAS process, therefore putting a programme higher in their priority list will increase the chance of getting into a programme in most cases. Before the release of admission results, only the bandings and not the actual choice order are provided to the educational institutions.

In 2011, the number of programme choices was reduced from 25 to the current 20 for students sitting the HKDSE. However, students may replace up to 5 of their choices after the release of their HKDSE results.

==Selection process==
Each and every programme offered under JUPAS will make a &quot;Merit order list&quot; for all its applicants based on their academic performances, interview performances and extracurricular activities. The &quot;Merit order list&quot; and the applicants rank list are then entered into a match-making process. The process uses eliminations so that all applicants will only get into a programme that they preferred most in their application form and which they qualify.

Note that most of the programmes only look into the applicants&#x27; academic performance when they create their &quot;Merit order list&quot;. In most of the cases both the results of the HKALE and HKCEE are taken into account. Although performance in the HKALE is still the most important admission factor, some particular universities do count 40% or 50% or CE results in calculating student&#x27;s academic performance rather than the usual 0–20%. Because of the cancellation of fine grades in both the HKCEE and HKALE, the HKCEE becomes a very important factor in deciding whether a student is admitted or not when he/she is close to the cutoff line since it is more difficult to compare student&#x27;s performance with only 5 (passing) rank per subject.

In addition, some of the programmes weigh particular subjects more than others. For example, many commercial subjects double counts or even triple counts the results of HKALE Use of English and HKCEE English in calculating admission scores.

The first round admission results are traditionally released on the Wednesday before the week that the HKCEE results are announced and the whole admission process proceeds until late August, which may be only one week before some member institutions commence their first semester in their academic year.

==Difficulty==
Because of the high degree of difficulty of the HKALE and the fixed quota of places in universities in recent years, JUPAS was considered one of the most competitive university application schemes in the world, which media and scholars claim to be only second to the National Higher Education Entrance Examination of China. A significant large number (more than 30% since 2011) of applicants achieving the minimum Degree Programme requirement would end up not being offered by any Degree-level programmes, or even not receiving an offer, through JUPAS.

The admission rate have a drastic drop in 2012&#x27;s admission, as because under 334 Scheme, most of the secondary school student can enter the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (thus eligible to apply JUPAS) make the number of admissions increase drastically. (Not every students can apply for HKALE due to HKCEE requirements for non-mature candidates.)

In comparison, between the estimated entrance rate of JUPAS and direct entries from sub-degree programmes, JUPAS has a significantly higher entrance rate. Since JUPAS is open to students not already in full-time programmes under JUPAS, this has prompted some students studying for sub-degrees to retake certain subjects to improve their chances of getting into government-funded degree programmes.

The table below shows the school candidates achieving minimum Degree Programme requirement compared with JUPAS Degree Programme intakes. The actual percentage differs slightly due to non-school HKALE/HKDSE candidates being admitted, candidates not entering their programme of Main Round Offer due to result of HKALE appeal (which made them receive a better offer), or candidates giving up their offer.

Intakes from HKALE and HKCEE (2003–2012)

Note:
#Requirement and offer in above table stands for degree-level programme (including OUHK self-financed programme since 2006 intake)/requirement due to the difference of admission requirement in degree/sub-degree programmes.
#The list does not include Early Admission Scheme intakes and Sub-degree Offers.

Intakes from HKDSE (2012–Present)
==Sub-systems==
Apart from the main selection scheme, JUPAS also offers a few sub-systems and schemes for candidates who may not do well academically, but have proved qualities/needs in other areas.

===Sub-system for applicants with a disability===
Applicants with the following disabilities may apply through this scheme:
* Physical handicapped
* Hearing impairment
* Visual impairment
* Visceral disability
* Speech impairment
* Autism
* Mental illness

The goal of this sub-system is to allow applicants to find out as early as possible the special assistance and facilities institutions could provide to them on their admission. Applicants may receive separate offers through this sub-system.

===Sub-system for school principal&#x27;s nominations===
Each principal of a local secondary school may nominate up to three students from his/her own school. Those students must have outstanding achievements in non-academic areas such as sports, music, social services, other cultural activities, or have demonstrated leadership abilities. The goal of this scheme is to encourage students to go beyond academics during their secondary studies.

===Self recommendation scheme===
This scheme is for applicants with outstanding achievements in extracurricular activities. Applicants who apply for this scheme in addition to the main scheme will be able to provide a portfolio of extracurricular activities to the institutes they applies to, so the institutes may also consider the applicants&#x27; achievements in other areas, in addition to their academic achievements. The goal for this scheme is to encourage students to participate in more extracurricular activities during their secondary studies.

== Early Admissions Scheme ==
Early Admissions Scheme, a subsystem of JUPAS, had been adopted between academic year of 2002/03 to 2010/11. It was tailor-made for the Secondary 6 students who achieved outstanding result in the HKCEE. They could skip the HKALE and be directly admitted to the University of Hong Kong, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, or the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology after attaining certain levels in the HKCEE. Roughly 3–5% of total JUPAS intakes had participated in this scheme until it was abolished in the academic year of 2011/12.

<text>Merengue is a type of music and dance originating in present-day Dominican Republic which has become a very popular genre throughout Latin America, and also in several major cities in the United States with Latino communities. Merengue was inscribed on November 30, 2016 in the representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO.

Merengue was developed in the middle of the 1800s, originally played with European stringed instruments (bandurria and guitar). Years later, the stringed instruments were replaced by the accordion, thus conforming, together with the güira and the tambora, the instrumental structure of the typical merengue ensemble. This set, with its three instruments, represents the synthesis of the three cultures that made up the idiosyncrasy of Dominican culture. The European influence is represented by the accordion, the African by the Tambora, which is a two-head drum, and the Taino or aboriginal by the güira.

The genre was later promoted by Rafael Trujillo, the dictator from 1930 to 1961, who turned it into the national music and dance style of the Dominican Republic. In the United States it was first popularized by New York–based groups and bandleaders like Rafael Petiton Guzman, beginning in the 1930s, and Angel Viloria y su Conjunto Típico Cibaeño in the 1950s. It was during the Trujillo era that the merengue &quot;Compadre Pedro Juan&quot;, by Luis Alberti, became an international hit and standardized the 2-part form of the merengue.

Famous merengue artists and groups include Juan Luis Guerra, Wilfrido Vargas, Milly Quezada, Toño Rosario, Fernando Villalona, Los Hermanos Rosario, Bonny Cepeda, Johnny Ventura, Eddy Herrera, Sergio Vargas, La Mákina, Miriam Cruz, Las Chicas Del Can, Kinito Mendez, Jossie Esteban y la Patrulla 15, Pochy y su Cocoband, Cuco Valoy, Ramón Orlando, Alex Bueno, The New York Band, Elvis Crespo, Olga Tañón, Gisselle, Conjunto Quisqueya and Grupomanía.

The popularity of merengue has been increasing in Venezuela. Venezuelan Merengueros include Roberto Antonio, Miguel Moly, Natusha, Porfi Jiménez, Billo&#x27;s Caracas Boys, and Los Melodicos. Merengue is also popular in the coastal city of Guayaquil in Ecuador.

The new line of merengue created in New York City has become very popular amongst younger listeners. Known as &quot;Merengue de Mambo&quot;, its proponents include Omega, Oro 24, Los Ficos, Los Gambinos, Alberto Flash, Mala Fe, Henry Jimenez, and Aybar.

Although the etymology of &quot;merengue&quot; can be disputed, there are a few theories about where the word might have derived from. One suggestion is that the term derives from meringue, a dish made from egg whites that is popular in Latin-American countries. The sound made by the whipping of eggs supposedly resembles the guiro used in merengue.

==History==

The origins of the music are traced to the land of El Cibao, where merengue cibaeño and merengue típico are the terms most musicians use to refer to classical merengue. The word Cibao was a native name for the island, although the Spanish used it in their conquest to refer to a specific part of the island, the highest mountainous range. The term merengue cibaeño is therefore partially native and so merengue might also be a derivation of a native word related to song, music, dance, or festival.

Merengue was first mentioned in the mid-19th century with the earliest documented evidence being newspaper articles. Some of the articles inform about a &quot;lascivious&quot; dance, and also highlight merengue displacing the Tumba. The genre had originated within the rural, northern valley region around the city of Santiago called the Cibao. It later spread throughout the country and became popular among the urban population.

The oldest form of merengue was typically played on string instruments. When the accordion came to the island in the 1880s, introduced by German traders, it quickly became the primary instrument, and to this day is still the instrument of choice in &quot;merengue típico&quot;. Later, the piano and brass instruments were introduced to the genre.

==Musical style==
Three main types of merengue are played in the Dominican Republic today. &quot;Merengue típico&quot;, which is usually called &quot;perico ripiao&quot;, is the oldest style commonly played. The other two types are &quot;merengue de orquesta&quot; (big-band merengue) and &quot;merengue de guitarra&quot; (guitar merengue).

===Rhythm===
Merengues are fast arrangements with a beat. The traditional instrumentation for a &quot;conjunto típico&quot; (traditional band), the usual performing group of folk merengue, is a diatonic accordion, a two–sided drum, called a tambora, held on the lap, and a güira. A güira is a percussion instrument that sounds like a maraca. It is a sheet of metal with small bumps on it (created with hammer and nail), shaped into a cylinder, and played with a stiff brush. The güira is brushed steadily on the downbeat with an &quot;and-a&quot; thrown in at certain points, or played in more complex patterns that generally mark the time. &quot;Caballito&quot; rhythm, or a quarter and two eighths, is also common. The double-headed drum is played on one side with a stick syncopation and on the other side with the palm of the hand.

The traditional (some say fundamental) signature rhythm figure of merengue is the &quot;quintillo&quot;, which is essentially a syncopated motif whose pattern is broken by five successive drumhead hits at the transition between every second and third beat, alternating between the hand and the stick. To purists, a merengue without quintillo is not truly a merengue, a viewpoint that has gradually disappeared as other alternate figures are used more frequently (as the one traditionally called &quot;jaleo&quot;, also known as &quot;merengue bomba&quot;, wrongly identified as a mixture of merengue and Puerto Rican bomba music, and which actually also has its roots in traditional merengue).

Three main types of merengue are played in the Dominican Republic today. Merengue típico, which is usually called &quot;perico ripiao&quot;, is the oldest style commonly played. In English &quot;perico ripiao&quot; means &quot;ripped parrot&quot;, which suggests controversy but which is said to be the name of a brothel where the music was originally played. The other two types are &quot;merengue de orquesta&quot; (big-band merengue) and &quot;merengue de guitarra&quot; (guitar merengue).

===Stylistic changes===

At first, merengue típico was played on stringed instruments like the tres and cuatro, but when Germans came to the island in the late 19th century trading their instruments for tobacco, the accordion quickly replaced the strings as lead instrument. Típico groups play a variety of rhythms, but most common are the merengue and the pambiche. In the 1930s–1950s, a bass instrument was also often used. Called marimba, it resembles the Cuban marímbula, and is a large box-shaped thumb piano with 3-6 metal keys. The main percussion instruments, güira and tambora, have been a part of the ensemble since the music&#x27;s inception, and are so important that they are often considered symbolic of the whole country. The güira is a metal scraper believed to be of native Taíno origin, while the tambora is a two-headed drum of African origin. Together with the European accordion, the típico group symbolizes the three cultures that combined to make today&#x27;s Dominican Republic.
One important figure in early merengue was Francisco &quot;Ñico&quot; Lora (1880–1971), who is often credited for quickly popularizing the accordion at the turn of the 20th century. Lora was once asked how many merengues he had composed in his lifetime and he answered &quot;thousands&quot;, probably without much exaggeration, and many of these compositions are still a standard part of the típico repertoire. He was a skilled improviser who could compose songs on the spot, by request. But he has also been likened to a journalist, since in his precomposed songs &quot;he commented on everything with his accordion&quot; (Pichardo, in Austerlitz 1997:35). His compositions discussed current events such as Cuban independence, World War I, the arrival of the airplane, and US occupation of the Dominican Republic. Among Lora&#x27;s contemporaries are Toño Abreu and Hipólito Martínez, best remembered for their merengue &quot;Caña Brava&quot;. This popular song was composed in 1928 or 1929 as an advertisement for the Brugal rum company, who were then selling a rum of the same name. Brugal paid Martínez $5 for his efforts.

Típico musicians continued to innovate within their style during the latter half of the twentieth century. Tatico Henríquez (d.1976), considered the godfather of modern merengue típico, replaced the marimba with electric bass and added a saxophone (it was used before, but infrequently) to harmonize with the accordion. A prolific composer, Tatico&#x27;s influence cannot be overestimated: nationally broadcast radio and television appearances brought his music to all parts of the country, leading to widespread imitation of his style and dissemination of his compositions. Today, these works form the core of any típico musician&#x27;s repertoire. Other innovations from this period include the addition of the bass drum now played by the güirero with a foot pedal, a development credited to Rafael Solano. Many of today&#x27;s top accordionists also began their careers during this period, including El Ciego de Nagua, Rafaelito Román, and Francisco Ulloa.

===Arrangements===

In the 1990s, most groups maintained the five-man lineup of accordion, sax, tambora, güira, and bass guitar, though a few new innovations have been made. Some modern band leaders have also added congas, timbales (played by the tamborero), and keyboards to their groups in an attempt to reach a wider audience and narrow the gap between the típico and orquesta styles. The most popular artist at present is El Prodigio, a young accordionist who is respected among típico musicians of all ages. Though he has become famous for recording his own compositions in a modern style, he is also able to perform all the &quot;standards&quot; of the traditional típico repertoire and is a talented, jazzy improviser. New York–based groups like Fulanito have experimented with the fusion of típico accordion with rap vocals. Young artists such as these have been able to bring merengue típico to new audiences.

Merengue típico songs are generally composed in two parts. The first section is rhythmically straightforward and is used to introduce the song&#x27;s melodic and lyrical material; here, verses are sung and the only improvisation occurs at the end of song lines, when the accordion or saxophone fills in. The second section is dominated by improvisation, more complex rhythms, and hard-driving mambo, or the part of the song where melody instruments (sax and accordion) unite to play catchy, syncopated riffs or jaleos which help motivate and stimulate dancers. Típico rhythms include merengue derecho, or straight-ahead merengue, which is the kind of fast-paced time merengue most of us are used to hearing, usually used in the first section. &quot;Pambiche&quot; or merengue apambichao is similar but usually slower, and can be recognized by the double slap rhythm on the tambora. Guinchao is a third rhythm combining the first two that is commonly heard in the second section of a merengue. Típico groups do not have to limit themselves to merengue as they can also play other traditional rhythms from the Dominican Republic and elsewhere, though this was more common in the past than at present. Mangulina and guaracha are now seldom heard; the latter is a clave-based style in originally from Cuba, while the former is a dance native to the Dominican Republic. Paseo was a slow introduction to a merengue song during which couples would promenade around the dance floor in stately fashion. Orquesta or big-band merengue became the merengue of choice for the urban Dominican middle and upper classes in the twentieth century. Although merengue had been played in upper-class salons as early as the 1850s, moralists like then-president Ulises Espaillat succeeded in banning the dance from such locations only two decades later, causing the merengue to effectively die out in the cities. Still, it was kept alive by rural musicians such as accordionist/composer Nico Lora, and it began to reappear in towns of the Cibao during the 1910s.

During that decade, several composers, including Julio Alberto Hernández, Juan Espínola of La Vega and Juan Francisco García of Santiago, tried to resuscitate the dance by creating orchestrated, written scores based on folk merengue melodies. One of these was García&#x27;s 1918 work titled &quot;Ecos del Cibao&quot;. Composer Luis Alberti later reported that such pieces, especially the famous tune known as the Juangomero, were frequently played at the end of an evening&#x27;s program that otherwise featured imported styles like waltzes, mazurkas, polkas, danzas, danzones, and one- and two-steps.

While these early efforts in orchestrated merengue generally succeeded only in scandalizing their audiences, the political changes that occurred in the Dominican Republic over the next few years made a resurgence of the merengue possible. The resented North American invasion of 1916 seems to have made the general public more disposed to support autochthonous rhythms over imported ones, though the raucous rural accordion sound was still unacceptable to high-society tastes. Nevertheless, when Rafael Leonidas Trujillo took power in 1930, he imposed the merengue upon all levels of society, some say as a form of punishment for the elites that had previously refused to accept him. The soon-to-be dictator must also have realized the symbolic power of the rural folk music and its potential for creating support among the masses, since he took accordionists with him around the Republic during his campaign tours from the very beginning.

==Rafael Leonidas Trujillo==
Until the 1930s, the music was considered &quot;immoral&quot; by the general population. Its more descriptive and colorful name, perico ripiao (literally &quot;ripped parrot&quot; in Spanish), was said to have been the name of a brothel in Santiago where the music was played. Moralists tried to ban merengue music and the provocative dance that accompanied it, but with little success.

Merengue experienced a sudden elevation of status during dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo&#x27;s reign from 1930 to 1961. Although he was from the south rather than the Cibao, he did come from a rural area and from a lower-class family, so he decided that the rural style of perico ripiao should be the Dominican national symbol. He ordered numerous merengues to be composed in his honor. With titles like &quot;Literacy&quot;, &quot;Trujillo is great and immortal&quot;, and &quot;Trujillo the great architect&quot;, these songs describe his virtues and extol his contributions to the country. Trujillo&#x27;s interest in and encouragement of merengue helped create a place for the music on the radio and in respectable ballrooms. Luis Alberti and other musicians began to play with &quot;big band&quot; or orquesta instrumentation, replacing the accordion with a horn section and initiating a split between this new, mostly urban style and mostly rural perico ripiao. New York City Latino radio is still dominated by orquesta merengue.

Following his election, Trujillo ordered musicians to compose and perform numerous merengues extolling his supposed virtues and attractiveness to women. Luis Alberti and other popular bandleaders created a style of merengue more acceptable to the urban middle class by making its instrumentation more similar to the big bands then popular in the United States, replacing the accordion with a large brass section but maintaining the tambora and güira as a rhythmic base. They also composed lyrics free of the rough language and double-entendres characterizing the folk style. The first merengue to attain success at all levels of society was Alberti&#x27;s famous 1936 work, &quot;Compadre Pedro Juan&quot;. This was actually a resetting of García&#x27;s &quot;Ecos&quot;, itself based on earlier folk melodies, and thus it upheld a long-standing tradition in merengue típico of creating songs by applying new words to recycled melodies. The new, popular-style merengue began to grow in quite different directions from its predecessor, merengue típico. It became ever more popular throughout the country through its promotion by Petán Trujillo, the dictator&#x27;s brother, on his state-sponsored radio station, La Voz Dominicana. Musicians like Luis Senior and Pedro Pérez kept listeners interested by inventing new variations like the &quot;bolemengue&quot; and &quot;jalemengue&quot;.

Merengue does not have as plainly strong African origins as other forms of Dominican music, and therefore did not conflict with Trujillo&#x27;s racist ideology. Trujillo promoted the music for political gain as a focus of national solidarity and political propaganda. It helped his efforts to unify a Dominican identity.

After Trujillo&#x27;s assassination in 1961, the merengue orquesta underwent great change. During that decade, Johnny Ventura&#x27;s Combo Show drove crowds wild with their showy choreography, slimmed-down brass section, and salsa influences. In the 1970s, Wilfrido Vargas sped up the tempo and incorporated influences from disco and rock. (The term &quot;orquesta&quot;, simply meaning a large musical ensemble, is now used to describe the pop merengue groups based on Ventura&#x27;s and Vargas&#x27;s models as well as the older Alberti style.) In addition, a new rhythm called &quot;merengue a lo maco&quot; appeared and was popularized by groups including Los Hermanos Rosario and Cheche Abreu. Far less complicated than other merengue rhythms, it was particularly useful for adapting songs from other styles like bachata, Colombian vallenato, Mexican rancheras, and North American pop. This process of remaking is called fusilamiento and continues to be a source for many merengue hits to this day.

==Merengue around the world==

Merengue has been heard in New York since the 1930s, when Eduardo Brito became the first to sing the Dominican national music there before going on to tour Spain. Salcedo-born, Juilliard-educated Rafael Petitón Guzmán formed the first Dominican-led band in the city with his Orquesta Lira Dominicana, which played in all the popular ballrooms in the 1930s and 1940s, while at the same time Angel Viloria played popular tunes on accordion with his &quot;conjunto típico cibaeño&quot; for Big Apple fans. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the massive migration of Dominicans in the 1960s and 1970s that the music reached a mass audience. In 1967, Joseíto Mateo, Alberto Beltrán, and Primitivo Santos took merengue to Madison Square Garden for the first time. Later, New York–based groups like La Gran Manzana and Milly, Jocelyn y los Vecinos, a group unusual for being fronted by women, gained a following in the diaspora as well as back on the island.

By the 1980s, merengue was so big it was even beating out salsa on the airwaves. That decade was also notable for a boom in all-female orchestras, and Las Chicas del Can became particularly popular. Since then, musicians like Juan Luis Guerra, trained at Boston&#x27;s Berklee school, Toño Rosario and former rocker Luis Díaz have brought merengue even further abroad, truly internationalizing the music. Guerra collaborated with African guitarists, experimented with indigenous Caribbean sounds, and explored Dominican roots music with típico accordionist Francisco Ulloa, while Díaz (an innovator since his work with 1970s folklore group Convite) fused merengue, rock, merengue típico, and bachata in his productions.

In the 21st century, orquesta musicians began to voice concern that their style would be eclipsed in popularity by bachata and merengue típico. Perhaps for this reason, some pop merengue singers have gone to extreme lengths to attract attention, such as Tulile and Mala Fe&#x27;s excursions into women&#x27;s wear. But even without such antics, recordings by groups like Los Toros Band, Rubby Pérez, Alex Bueno, Sergio Vargas, and the ever-popular Los Hermanos Rosario continue to sell well. Pop merengue also has a remarkably strong following on the neighboring island of Puerto Rico, which has produced its own stars, like Olga Tañón and Elvis Crespo.

In more urban settings, merengue is played with all manner of instrumentation, but the tambora and the güira are signatures. Today, &quot;merengue de orquesta&quot; is most popular. It uses a large horn section with paired saxophones, piano, timbales, hi-hat, backup singers, and conga, in addition to tambora, güira, and bass. In modern merengue típico a saxophone is an addition to the accordion, along with electric bass guitar. A proof of the great adaptability of the music can be found in the Dominican National Symphony&#x27;s presentation in 2003 of a concert series entitled &quot;Symphonic Merengue&quot;, in which the Symphonic Orchestra consisting of woodwinds, brass, strings, and the like played popular tunes.

==Distribution==
Merengue music found mainstream exposure in other areas of Latin America in the 1970s and &#x27;80s, with its peak in the 1990s. In the Andean countries like Peru and Chile, merengue dance lost the characteristic of being danced close together, instead being danced separately while moving the arms.

==Women in merengue==
Merengue, from its conception and through time, has classically been a male-dominated genre. In recent times, however, the genre has experienced a change in this situation. Several female artists and all-female bands have risen to relative stardom. This upheaval was influenced by the contributions of singer/bandleader Johnny Ventura’s modernization of the sound of merengue in 1960, modernizing the sound from its “big-band”-esque setup with a quickening of tempo and inclusion of a visually-appealing element, with glitzy costumes and choreography. In the early 1970s, trumpeter and singer Wilfrido Vargas furthered the modernization of merengue by including electronic elements and strengthening the focus of a visual stage presence. These two men modernized the merengue stage, thereby increasing the palatability of a female merengue presence.

One of the most influential women in merengue is Fefita La Grande. Her birth name was Manuela Josefa Cabrera Taveras. She performed for Petán Trujillo, the brother of the Dominican Republic&#x27;s president, convincing him to give her father a home and a job she could earn money from. Her rise to fame led to a great demand for her performances in New York, the Dominican Republic, and even Europe. Fefita&#x27;s efforts forced men to work alongside women in merengue and accept that there is a place for them.
Female merengue bands began to emerge in the 1970s, with examples such as Gladys Quero&#x27;s &quot;Orquesta Unisex&quot;, but started gaining popularity in the early 1980s with Aris García&#x27;s &quot;La Media Naranja&quot;, &quot;Las Chicas del País&quot; and, principally, pianist Belkis Concepcion&#x27;s band, Las Chicas del Can. They are known by their fans as Las Reinas del Merengue, or in English, The Queens of Merengue. The band currently consists of eleven members, including horns, rhythm, dancers, and singers. After Belkis Concepcion left the band in 1985, Miriam Cruz took over as lead vocalist and led the band on tours through Europe. Soon after Concepcion followed the “mother figure” of merengue—Milly Quesada. She led the group Los Vecinos, which includes her sister Jocelyn and cousins Rafael and Martin, based in New York City. In reference to this female-merengue phenomena, Jocelyn Quesada states,

Yet another notable all-female merengue group is the trio Chantelle. The women are Puerto Rican, not Dominican, and both this and their gender testify to merengue&#x27;s growing popularity.

Las Chicas del Can was the first all-female band from the Dominican Republic, formed in 1981, which paved the road for other Latina artists. Known as “Las Reinas de Merengue”, which means “The Queens of Merengue”, they not only sang and danced, but also played a variety of instruments such as the trumpet, conga drums and the guitar. Las Chicas del Can were extremely successful, earning several platinum and gold records. Their hit single “El Negro No Puede” was later remade by Shakira, in her song “Waka Waka”.

Milly Quezada was born as Milagros Quezada Borbon on May 21, 1955. She is a singer in Latin America. Her hometown is Dominican Republic. She graduated from New York City College with a communications degree. Then she was known as the Queen of Merengue, or La Reina de Merengue. She had a group with her two brothers and sister called Milly, Y Los Vecinos. The band would write songs about women&#x27;s independence and freedom of choice.

<text>Merengue (, ) is a style of Dominican music and dance. Merengue is the national dance of the Dominican Republic and is also important to national identity in the country. It is a type of danced walk and is accessible to a large variety of people with or without dance experience. The music of merengue draws influence from European and Afro-Cuban styles and mainly uses instruments like guitars, drums, and a charrasca or metal scraper. The dance originated as a rural dance and later became a ballroom dance. Merengue has three distinct sections: the paseo, the merengue proper, and the closing jaleo which includes improvisation.

Partners hold each other in a closed position. The leader holds the follower&#x27;s waist with their right hand and the follower&#x27;s right hand with their left hand at the follower&#x27;s eye level. Partners bend their knees slightly left and right, thus making the hips move left and right. The hips of the leader and follower move in the same direction throughout the song. The rhythm of these steps often accentuates either the right or left step. This pattern is often known as a ‘danced walk’. During this dance, a dancer will mostly put their weight on the same foot. Partners may walk sideways or circle each other, in small steps. They can switch to an open position and do separate turns without letting go of each other&#x27;s hands or by releasing one hand. During these turns, they may twist their handhold into intricate pretzels. Other choreographies are also possible.

Although the tempo of the music may be frenetic, the upper body is kept steady and turns are slow, typically four beats/steps per complete turn.

In the social dancing of the United States the &quot;empalizada&quot; style is replaced by exaggerated Cuban motion, taught in chain ballroom studios for dances of Latin American origin (cha-cha-cha, rumba, mambo, salsa).

==History==

Merengue music and dance rose to popularity in the Dominican Republic during the Haitian occupation of Santo Domingo from 1822 to 1844. After the occupation ended, Dominican merengue was changed to distance its origins from Haiti. The tempo of Dominican merengue was increased to differentiate it from Haitian Méringue along with other musical changes. Both still share the danced walk as their basic step. The relatively easy steps of merengue allowed it to be easily learned and popularized. In terms of dance, Dominican merengue is often done with less space between partners and different hip movements as compared to the Haitian version. Many of these changes were fueled by anti-Haitian and anti-black sentiments during this time.

Around this time Puerto Rico&#x27;s governor, Juan de la Pezuela y Cevallos, banned merengue in Puerto Rico for its &quot;corrupting influence&quot; including a ten-day prison sentence for dancing it. Also around this time, merengue began being written and spoken about disapprovingly by elites in Dominican society. They argued that the dance, which contained hip movements, was too scandalous for ballrooms. Merengue then became mostly danced by rural peoples who embraced the dance and its African heritage.
According to Ramiro Burr, merengue was originally performed with acoustic groups. During the 20th century, merengue&#x27;s original lead instrument was the guitar. By the 1940s and 1950s it was performed with accordions. This form known as &quot;Merengue típico&quot; originated in the rural Northern Cibao region around the city of Santiago, resulting in the name &quot;merengue cibaeño&quot;. &quot;Merengue típico&quot; emphasizes traditional songs dating back as far as the nineteenth century. This style of merengue was popularized by former dictator Rafael Trujillo, who was from the Cibao region. Trujillo and his brother, Jose Arismendy Trujillo, turned merengue into the cultural symbol that it is today by investing in merengue bands and controlling many aspects of the music industry. They used merengue as a form of propaganda and national pride. Previously merengue had often been as a social commentary and under Trujillo it morphed to songs that praised him and the government. Because of Trujillo&#x27;s influence &quot;Merengue típico&quot; is now the main form of merengue in the Dominican Republic.

<text>Henry Clay Frick (December 19, 1849 – December 2, 1919) was an American industrialist, financier, and art patron. He founded the H. C. Frick &amp; Company coke manufacturing company, was chairman of the Carnegie Steel Company and played a major role in the formation of the giant U.S. Steel manufacturing concern. He had extensive real estate holdings in Pittsburgh and throughout the state of Pennsylvania. He later built the Neoclassical Frick Mansion in Manhattan (now designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark), and upon his death donated his extensive collection of old master paintings and fine furniture to create the celebrated Frick Collection and art museum. However, as a founding member of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, he was also in large part responsible for the alterations to the South Fork Dam that caused its failure, leading to the catastrophic Johnstown Flood. His vehement opposition to unions also caused violent conflict, most notably in the Homestead Strike.

==Early life==
Frick was born in West Overton, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, in the United States, a grandson of Abraham Overholt (Oberholzer), the owner of the prosperous Overholt Whiskey distillery (see Old Overholt). His father was of Swiss ancestry; his mother was of German ancestry. Frick&#x27;s father, John W. Frick, was unsuccessful in business pursuits. Henry Clay Frick attended Otterbein College for one year, but did not graduate. In 1871, at 21 years old, Frick joined two cousins and a friend in a small partnership, using a beehive oven to turn coal into coke for use in steel manufacturing, and vowed to be a millionaire by the age of thirty. The company was called Frick Coke Company.

Thanks to loans from the family of lifelong friend Andrew Mellon, by 1880, Frick bought out the partnership. The company was renamed H. C. Frick &amp; Company, employed 1,000 workers and controlled 80 percent of the coal output in Pennsylvania, operating coal mines in Westmoreland and Fayette counties, where he also operated banks of beehive coke ovens. Some of the brick and stone structures are still visible in both Fayette and Westmoreland Counties.

==H. C. Frick and Andrew Carnegie==
Shortly after marrying Adelaide Howard Childs, in 1881, Frick met Andrew Carnegie in New York City while the Fricks were on their honeymoon. This introduction would lead to an eventual partnership between H. C. Frick &amp; Company and Carnegie Steel Company and, eventually, to United States Steel. This partnership ensured that Carnegie&#x27;s steel mills had adequate supplies of coke. Frick became chairman of the company. Carnegie made multiple attempts to force Frick out of the company they had created by making it appear that the company had nowhere left to go and that it was time for Frick to retire. Despite the contributions Frick had made towards Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s fortune, Carnegie disregarded him in many executive decisions including finances.

==The Johnstown Flood==
At the suggestion of his friend Benjamin Ruff, Frick helped to found the exclusive South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club high above Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The charter members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club were Benjamin Ruff; T. H. Sweat, Charles J. Clarke, Thomas Clark, Walter F. Fundenberg, Howard Hartley, Henry C. Yeager, J. B. White, Henry Clay Frick, E. A. Meyers, C. C. Hussey, D. R. Ewer, C. A. Carpenter, W. L. Dunn, W. L. McClintock, and A. V. Holmes.

The sixty-odd club members were the leading business tycoons of Western Pennsylvania, and included among their number Frick&#x27;s best friend, Andrew Mellon, his attorneys Philander Knox and James Hay Reed, as well as Frick&#x27;s occasional business partner Andrew Carnegie. The club members made inadequate repairs to what was at that time the world&#x27;s largest earthen dam, behind which formed a private lake called Lake Conemaugh. Less than downstream from the dam sat the city of Johnstown. Cambria Iron Company operated a large iron and steel work in Johnstown and its owner, Daniel J. Morrell, was concerned about the safety of the dam and the thoroughness of repairs made to it.

The Club fatally lowered the dam by between . Poor repairs and maintenance, unusually high snow melt and heavy spring rains combined to cause the dam to give way on May 31, 1889, resulting in the Johnstown Flood. A screen placed across the spillway by the club to prevent fish from escaping also partly blocked the main spillway. When word of the dam&#x27;s failure was telegraphed to Pittsburgh, Frick and other members of the club gathered to form the Pittsburgh Relief Committee for assistance to the flood victims, as well as determining never to speak publicly about the club or the flood. This strategy was a success, and Knox and Reed were able to fend off all lawsuits that would have placed blame upon the club&#x27;s members. With a volumetric flow rate that temporarily equalled that of the Mississippi River, the flood killed 2,208 people and caused US$17 million of damage (about $450 million in 2015 dollars).

The American Society of Civil Engineers launched an investigation of the South Fork Dam breach immediately after the flood. However, the report was delayed, subverted, and whitewashed, before being released two years after the disaster. A detailed discussion of what happened during the ASCE investigation, its participating engineers, and the science behind the 1889 flood was published in 2018.

==Old Overholt whiskey==
In 1881, Frick, already wealthy, took control of his grandfather&#x27;s whiskey company, Old Overholt. Frick split ownership with Andrew Mellon and Charles W. Mauck; each owned one-third of the company. The family&#x27;s whiskey company was a sentimental side business for Frick, and was headquartered in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Frick Building. In 1907, as prohibition became more popular across the country, Frick and Mellon removed their names from the distilling license, although they retained ownership in the company. Upon Frick&#x27;s death in 1919, he left his share of the company to Mellon.

==Homestead strike==
Frick and Carnegie&#x27;s partnership was strained over actions taken in response to the Homestead Steel Strike, an 1892 labor strike at the Homestead Works of the Carnegie Steel Company, called by the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers. At Homestead, striking workers, some of whom were armed, had locked the company staff out of the factory and surrounded it with pickets. Frick was known for his anti-union policy and as negotiations were still taking place, he ordered the construction of a solid board fence topped with barbed wire around mill property. The workers dubbed the newly fortified mill &quot;Fort Frick.&quot; With the mill ringed by striking workers, Pinkerton agents planned to access the plant grounds from the river. Three hundred Pinkerton detectives assembled on the Davis Island Dam on the Ohio River about five miles (8 km) below Pittsburgh at 10:30 p.m. on the night of July 5, 1892. They were given Winchester rifles, placed on two specially-equipped barges and towed upriver with the object of removing the workers by force. Upon their landing, a large mêlée between workers and Pinkerton detectives ensued. Ten men were killed, nine of them workers, and there were seventy injuries. The Pinkerton agents were thrown back, and the riot was ultimately quelled only by the intervention of 8,000 armed state militia under the command of Major General George R. Snowden. During the confrontation Frick issued an ultimatum to Homestead workers, which restated his refusal to speak with union representatives and threatened to have striking workers evicted from their homes.

Among working-class Americans, Frick&#x27;s actions against the strikers were condemned as excessive, and he soon became a target of even more union organizers. Because of this strike, people like Alan Petrucelli had thought that he is depicted as the &quot;rich man&quot; in Maxo Vanka&#x27;s murals in St. Nicholas Croatian Church, but the Society to Preserve the Millvale Murals of Maxo Vanka (which works to preserve the artwork) says it depicts Andrew Mellon.

==Assassination attempt==
In 1892, during the Homestead strike, anarchist Alexander Berkman attempted to assassinate Frick. On July 23, Berkman, armed with a revolver and a sharpened steel file, entered Frick&#x27;s office in downtown Pittsburgh.

Frick, realizing what was happening, attempted to rise from his chair while Berkman pulled a revolver and fired at nearly point-blank range. The bullet hit Frick in the left earlobe, penetrated his neck near the base of the skull, and lodged in his back. The impact knocked Frick down, and Berkman fired again, striking Frick for a second time in the neck and causing him to bleed extensively. Carnegie Steel vice president (later, president) John George Alexander Leishman, who was with Frick, was then able to grab Berkman&#x27;s arm and prevented a third shot, possibly saving Frick&#x27;s life.

Frick was seriously wounded but rose and (with the assistance of Leishman) tackled his assailant. All three men crashed to the floor, where Berkman managed to stab Frick four times in the leg with the pointed steel file before finally being subdued by other employees and a carpenter, who had rushed into the office.

Frick was back at work within a week; Berkman was charged and found guilty of attempted murder. Berkman&#x27;s actions in planning the assassination clearly indicated a premeditated intent to kill, and he was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Negative publicity from the attempted assassination resulted in the collapse of the strike.

==Private life==

Frick married Adelaide Howard Childs of Pittsburgh on December 15, 1881. They had four children: Childs Frick (born March 12, 1883), Martha Howard Frick (born August 9, 1885), Helen Clay Frick (born September 3, 1888) and Henry Clay Frick, Jr. (born July 8, 1892). In 1882, after the formation of the partnership with Andrew Carnegie, Frick and his wife bought a home they eventually called Clayton, an estate in Pittsburgh&#x27;s East End. They moved into the home in early 1883. The Frick children were born in Pittsburgh and were raised at Clayton. Two of them, Henry, Jr. and Martha, died in infancy or childhood.

In 1904, he built Eagle Rock, a summer estate at Prides Crossing in Beverly, Massachusetts on Boston&#x27;s fashionable North Shore. The 104-room mansion designed by Little &amp; Browne was razed in 1969.

Frick was a fervent art collector whose wealth allowed him to accumulate a large collection. By 1905, Frick&#x27;s business, social and artistic interests had shifted from Pittsburgh to New York. He took his art collection with him to New York, rented the William H. Vanderbilt House, and served on many corporate boards.

For example, as a board member of the Equitable Life Insurance Company, Frick attempted the removal of James Hazen Hyde (the founder&#x27;s only son and heir) from the United States to France by seeking an appointment for him to become United States Ambassador to France. Frick had engaged a similar stratagem when orchestrating the ouster of the man who had saved his life, John George Alexander Leishman, from the presidency of Carnegie Steel a decade beforehand. In that instance, Leishman had chosen to accept the post as ambassador to Switzerland. Hyde, however, rebuffed Frick&#x27;s plan. He did, however, move to France, where he served as an ambulance driver during World War I and lived until the outbreak of World War II.

The Frick Collection is home to one of the finest collections of European paintings in the United States. It contains many works of art dating from the pre-Renaissance up to the post-Impressionist eras, displayed at the Henry Clay Frick House (built in 1913) in no logical or chronological order. It includes several very large paintings by J. M. W. Turner and John Constable. In addition to paintings, it also contains an exhibition of carpets, porcelain, sculptures, and period furniture.

Frick purchased the &quot;Westmoreland&quot;, a private railroad car, from the Pullman Company in 1910. The car cost nearly $40,000, and featured a kitchen, pantry, dining room, servant&#x27;s quarters, two staterooms, and a lavatory. Frick frequently used the car for travel between his residences in New York City, Pittsburgh, and Prides Crossing, Massachusetts, as well for trips to places such as Palm Beach, Florida, and Aiken, South Carolina. The car remained in the Frick family until it was scrapped by Helen Clay Frick in 1965. Photographs of family and friends travelling on the &quot;Westmoreland&quot; form part of the Frick archive, as do the original construction plans and upholstery fabric samples.
Frick and his wife Adelaide had booked tickets to travel back to New York on the inaugural trip of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912, along with J.P. Morgan. The couple canceled their trip after Adelaide sprained her ankle in Italy and missed the disastrous voyage.

Frick died of a heart attack on December 2, 1919, at age 69. He was buried in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Homewood Cemetery.

==Legacy==

Frick left a will in which he bequeathed of undeveloped land to the City of Pittsburgh for use as a public park, together with a $2 million trust fund to assist with the maintenance of the park. Frick Park opened in 1927. Between 1919 and 1942, money from the trust fund was used to enlarge the park, increasing its size to almost . 

Many years after her father&#x27;s death, Helen Clay Frick returned to Clayton in 1981, and lived there until her death in 1984. 

Frick was elected an honorary member of the Alpha chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity at the New England Conservatory of Music on October 19, 1917.

Frick Chemical Laboratory at Princeton University, built 1929, was named after Frick. Upon his death in 1919, he left a $6 million unrestricted bequest that the university used for the endowment of faculty salaries. After the completion of the new chemical laboratory in 1929, it was named for him in recognition of his interest and bequest. A new chemistry building, completed in 2010, bears the Frick Chemistry Laboratory name in honor of his 1919 bequest.

==Henry Clay Frick Business Records (Archives)==
The Henry Clay Frick archive of business records consisted of the documents regarding the business and financial dealings from 1849 to 1919. These original documents record the evolution of the period of American steel and coal industrial growth. Documentation includes first business activities, first coal firm, H.C. Frick &amp; Company, to the formation of United States Steel Corporation on March 2, 1901. Correspondence sent and received from prominent businessmen such as Andrew Carnegie, Charles Schwab, Andrew Mellon, Henry Oliver, H. H. Rogers, Henry Phipps, and J. P. Morgan are part of the collection. Much of the collection is available as digitized and openly accessible. Most of the collection is from 1881 to 1914, and is relevant to the history of the Pittsburgh region.

The archive of Frick&#x27;s great-grandfather, Henry Overholt (1739–1813), is also housed at the Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh Library System, University of Pittsburgh.

<text>Da Nang or Danang (, ) is the fifth-largest city in Vietnam by municipal population. It lies on the coast of the South China Sea of Vietnam at the mouth of the Hàn River, and is one of Vietnam&#x27;s most important port cities. As one of the country&#x27;s six direct-controlled municipalities, it falls under the administration of the central government.

The city was known as Cửa Hàn during early Đại Việt settlement, and as Tourane (or Turon) during French colonial rule. Before 1997, the city was part of Quang Nam – Da Nang Province. On 1 January 1997, Da Nang was separated from Quảng Nam Province to become one of four centrally controlled municipalities in Vietnam. Da Nang is designated as a first class city, and has a higher urbanization ratio than any of Vietnam&#x27;s other provinces or centrally governed cities.

Da Nang is the commercial and educational center of Central Vietnam and is the largest city in the region. It has a well-sheltered, easily accessible port, and its location on National Route 1 and the North–South Railway makes it a transport hub. It is within of several UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Imperial City of Huế, the Old Town of Hội An, and the Mỹ Sơn ruins.

APEC 2017 was hosted in Da Nang.

Da Nang has a Human Development Index of 0.800 (very high), ranking fifth among all municipalities and provinces of Vietnam.

==Names of Da Nang in different languages==

Most of the names by which Da Nang has been known make reference to its position at the Hàn River estuary. The city&#x27;s present name is generally agreed to be a Vietnamese adaptation of the Cham word , which is translated as &#x27;opening of a large river&#x27;.
Other Chamic sources, with similar definitions, have been proposed. Inrasara (aka ), a researcher specializing in Champa, suggests &quot;Da Nang&quot; is a variation of the Cham word (lit. &#x27;the large water&#x27;); Sakaya (aka ), another Champa researcher, claims a connection with the Raglai word , meaning &#x27;river source&#x27;.

Another name given to Da Nang was (lit. &#x27;mouth of the Han [river]&#x27;). The name used by the French, , is said to derive from this name, by way of a rough transliteration. Notably, this name (spelled &quot;Cua han&quot;) appears on maps of the area drafted by Alexandre de Rhodes in 1650. The name &quot;Kean&quot; (compare , roughly &#x27;Han market&#x27;) was another name purportedly used during the 17th century to refer to the land at the foot of the Hải Vân Pass.

Other names referring to Da Nang include:
* , a colloquial name which survives in folklore.
* , , and , literary names used by Confucian scholars.
* In Chinese, Danang is known as ), this is derived from the old name (&#x27;clam harbor&#x27;). 
* In chữ Nôm, used until 1945, is written as , a simplified form of . 
* , a name used briefly after the 1945 August Revolution, commemorating , the leader of popular revolts during the 1916 Duy Tân Resistance.

==History==
=== Ancient Vietnam ===

The city&#x27;s origins date back to the ancient kingdom of Champa, established in 192 AD. At its peak, the Chams&#x27; sphere of influence stretched from Huế to Vũng Tàu. The city of Indrapura, at the site of the modern village of Dong Duong in Quảng Nam Province (about from Da Nang), was the capital of Champa from about 875 to about 1000 AD. Also in the region of Da Nang were the ancient Cham city of Singhapura (&quot;City of the Lion&quot;), the location of which has been identified with an archeological site in the modern village of Trà Kiệu, and the valley of Mỹ Sơn, where a number of ruined temples and towers can still be viewed.

In the latter half of the 10th century, the kings of Indrapura came into conflict with the Đại Việt, who were then based at Hoa Lư near modern Hanoi. Champa had been independent, it found itself in need to defend its territory to contain the threat posed by the Khmer Empire in the west, and expand its territory to the north, hoping to conquer the Vietnamese nation. There, with the Vietnamese Kingdom in turmoil following the assassination of Đinh Tiên Hoàng, Champa made an unsuccessful attempt to invade Đại Việt in 979 with support of China, but failed due to the strong defence of Vietnamese territory under the command of Lê Hoàn. In 982, three ambassadors sent to Champa by Emperor Lê Hoàn of the Đại Việt (founder of the Early Lê dynasty) were detained in Indrapura. Lê Hoàn decided to go on the offensive, sacking Indrapura and killing the Cham King Parameshvaravarman I. As a result of these setbacks, the Cham eventually abandoned Indrapura around 1000 AD.

The Đại Việt campaign against Champa continued into the late 11th century, when the Cham were forced to cede their three northern provinces to the rulers of the Lý dynasty. Soon afterward, Vietnamese farmers began moving into the untilled former Cham lands, turning them into rice fields and moving relentlessly southward, delta by delta, along the narrow coastal plain. The southward expansion of Đại Việt (known as &quot;Nam Tiến&quot;) continued for several centuries, culminating in the annexation of most of the Cham territories by the end of the 15th century.

The Điện Hải Citadel was first built in 1813 as an earthen fortress located to the north of its present position, with An Hải citadel on the east bank built by Emperor Gia Long to protect the port, and by 1819, both Điện Hải and An Hải citadels had been rebuilt in brick. In 1823, Gia Long&#x27;s son and successor Minh Mạng rebuilt the original Điện Hải fortress on a high mound at the current location, being upgraded from a fortress (đồn) to a citadel (thành) in 1835.

===Western contact===
One of the first Europeans to visit Da Nang was Portuguese explorer António de Faria, who anchored in Da Nang in 1535. Faria was one of the first Westerners to write about the area and, through his influence, Portuguese ships began to call regularly at Hội An, which was then a much more important port than Da Nang. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, French and Spanish traders and missionaries regularly made landfall at Hội An, just south of Đà Nẵng. An American, John White, arrived at Da Nang (then called Turon) on 18 June 1819 in the brig &quot;Franklin&quot; of Salem, Massachusetts, and was advised that the country was recovering from devastating wars, and that what little goods had been produced in the area was already allocated. Other American ships arriving shortly after were the &quot;Marmion&quot; of Boston, and the &quot;Aurora&quot; and &quot;Beverly&quot; of Salem.

Conditions were such due to the wars that they were unable to conduct trade, and the subsequent missions of East India Company agent John Crawfurd in 1823 and the two missions of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s agent, American diplomat Edmund Roberts, in 1833 and 1836 were unable to secure trade agreements due to the exceptionally poor quality of the port. Following the edict of Emperor Minh Mạng in 1835, prohibiting European vessels from making landfall or pursuing trade except at Đà Nẵng, its port quickly superseded Hội An as the largest commercial port in the central region.

=== French Indochina ===

In 1847, French vessels dispatched by Admiral Cécille bombarded Đà Nẵng, ostensibly on the grounds of alleged persecution of Roman Catholic missionaries. In August 1858, once again ostensibly on the grounds of religious persecution, French troops, led by Admiral Charles Rigault de Genouilly, and under the orders of Napoleon III, landed in Đà Nẵng as part of the punitive Cochinchina Campaign.

The French overpowered the Vietnamese stationed in Da Nang, swiftly occupying the city and Tiên Sa peninsula (present-day Sơn Trà peninsula). The occupying forces were quickly placed under siege by the Vietnamese army under the command of Nguyễn Tri Phương, and were eventually forced to retreat in March 1860. The French were able to invade the southern stronghold of Saigon and, in June 1862, several provinces of southern Vietnam were ceded to the French as Cochinchina with the signing of the Treaty of Saigon.
Through two more decades of conflict, the French gradually strengthened their hold on Vietnam, culminating in the establishment of French Indochina () in October 1887. Two years later, in 1889, the French colonists renamed the city Tourane, placing it under the control of the governor general of French Indochina. It came to be considered one of Indochina&#x27;s five major cities, among Hanoi, Saigon–Cholon, Haiphong, and Huế.

In 1903, the colonial government authorised Société des docks et houillères de Tourane to proceed with the tramway construction, with its preliminary 9.5-kilometre stretch (between Observatory Point and Tourane Mỹ Khê) being opened on 9 November 1905. Under the state management, “Tramway de l’Îlot de l’Observatoire” opened to the public on 1 October 1907, stretching to Faifo (Hoi An) via Montagne de Marbre (Marble Mountains), operating until 31 December 1915.

=== Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) ===

During the Vietnam War, what is now the Da Nang International Airport was a major air base used by the South Vietnamese and United States Air Forces.

The base became one of the world&#x27;s busiest aircraft hubs during the war, reaching an average of 2,595 aircraft traffic operations daily, more than any other airport and airbase in the world at that time. The final U.S. ground combat operations in Vietnam ceased on 13 August 1972, when a residual force of the 196th Light Infantry Brigade stood down in Đà Nẵng. B Battery 3rd Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery Regiment fired the final U.S. artillery round and the 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment finished their final patrols. This residual force was known as &quot;Operation Gimlet&quot;. 
After the US withdrawal from the conflict, in the final stage of the conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam, Da Nang fell to the communist forces 29–30 March 1975. Vietnam issued two special postage stamps to commemorate this event, within its &quot;total liberation&quot; stamp set issued 14 December 1976.

Marble Mountain Air Facility, constructed in 1965, was also located in Da Nang.

=== After 1975 ===
Since the era of the construction of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Danang has become essentially the third city after Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi to be an important urban centre of the central region of Vietnam. Danang boasts numerous educational institutes as well as important sites of economy.

== Geography ==

Da Nang is the largest city in central Vietnam and one of the country&#x27;s most important ports. The city is surrounded by mountains to the west, and the South China Sea to the east. Da Nang borders Huế across the Hải Vân Pass to the north, along with the Quảng Nam Province to the south and west. It is south of Hanoi, and north of Ho Chi Minh City. The city has a total land area of , of which are urban districts and are rural districts.

=== Geology and topography ===
Geologically, Da Nang is at the edge of a Paleozoic fold belt known as the Truong Son Orogenic Zone, whose main deformation occurred during the early Carboniferous period. Da Nang&#x27;s topography is dominated by the steep Annamite mountain range to the north and north-west, which features peaks ranging from in height, and low-lying coastal plains with some salting to the south and east, with several white sand beaches along the coast.

== Demographics ==

Da Nang is the fifth-most populated city in Vietnam, with an area of and a population of 1,220,187 according to the update in 2022. Women make up 50.7% of Da Nang&#x27;s population.

=== Population growth ===
Da Nang&#x27;s population has been growing at rates of between 2.5% and 3% during most of the years between 2005 and 2011, significantly exceeding the national average of 1% to 1.2%. The growth rate briefly rose to 3.6% in 2010 before returning to its long-term trend with 2.68% in 2011. This is the third fastest growth rate in the country after the two southern manufacturing centers Bình Dương Province (4.41%) and Đồng Nai Province (3.5%).

Đà Nẵng&#x27;s population is estimated to reach one million inhabitants by 2014.
Migration has been the dominant factor in the city&#x27;s population growth at least since 2009, contributing 1.6% to 2.7% (2010) between 2009 and 2011. Out-migration has been relatively high in 2011 at 0.79% compared to 0.34% and 0.55% in previous years, while the in-migration rate has been exceeding 2% since 2009 and was at 2.28% in 2011.

Đà Nẵng&#x27;s natural population growth is only slightly higher than the national average. Its crude birth rate was recorded at 18 live births per 1000 persons. The crude death rate was measured at 6.7 per 1000 persons in 2011. Life expectancy at birth was estimated at 77.4 years for women and 72.4 years for men, or 74.8 years overall in the 2009 population census. The infant mortality rate was measured at 9.9 infant deaths per 1000 live births, less than two points above the nation&#x27;s average for urban areas.

=== Urbanization ===
The city has the highest urbanization ratio among provinces and municipalities in Vietnam, containing only 11 rural communes, the fewest of any province-level unit in Vietnam. As of 2009, 86.9% of Đà Nẵng&#x27;s population lived in urban areas; average annual urban population growth was 3.5%.

== Politics ==

The leading organ of the Communist Party in Da Nang City is the executive committee of the Communist Party. The current Secretary is Nguyen Van Quang.

The legislative branch of the city is the People&#x27;s Council of Da Nang City. The current chairman is Luong Nguyen Minh Triet.

The executive branch of the city is the People&#x27;s Committee of Da Nang City. The current chairman is Le Trung Chinh.

== Administrative divisions ==
The city of Da Nang is officially divided into eight district-level sub-divisions, including six urban districts (Hải Châu, Thanh Khê, Cẩm Lệ, Sơn Trà, Ngũ Hành Sơn and Liên Chiểu) and two rural districts (Hòa Vang and Hoàng Sa (Paracel Islands)). They are further subdivided into 45 wards and 11 communes. The city center of Da Nang is Hải Châu district.

Before 1997, the city was part of Quang Nam–Da Nang Province. On 1 January 1997, Da Nang was separated from Quang Nam Province to become one of five independent (centrally-controlled) municipalities in Vietnam.

== Economy ==

Da Nang is the leading industrial center of central Vietnam. Its GDP per capita was 19 million VND in 2007, one of the highest in Vietnam (after Hồ Chí Minh City, Hanoi, Bình Dương Province, and Đồng Nai Province). By 2009, this had increased to 27.3 million VND.

Da Nang led the Provincial Competitiveness Index rankings in 2008, 2009, and 2010 (and was second after Bình Dương Province in the three years before that), benefiting mostly from good infrastructure, good performance in labour training, transparency, proactive provincial leadership and low entry costs.

On Vietnam&#x27;s Provincial Competitiveness Index 2023, a key tool for evaluating the business environment in Vietnam’s provinces, Danang received a score of 68.79. This was a slight improvement from 2022 in which the province received a score of 68.52. In 2023, the province received its highest scores on the &#x27;Informal Charges&#x27; and &#x27;Law and Order’ criteria and lowest on &#x27;Policy Bias&#x27; and ‘Access To Land’.

Exports increased to US$575 million in 2008, but fell back to US$475 million in 2009.

=== Agriculture, forestry, fishing ===
Despite its status as a city, 37,800 people in Da Nang were employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing as of 2007, producing 45,000t of rice and 41,000t of fish. However, employment in these sectors had a clear negative trend in the first decade of the 21st century. Gross output has also been decreasing during the second half of the decade. Given Da Nang&#x27;s lack of agricultural land (9200ha as of 2007) and its location at the coast, fishing has been contributing more to the economy than agriculture, with a gross output more than twice that of agriculture.

=== Free Trade Zone (Da Nang FTZ) ===
=== Da Nang Hi-tech Park ===
=== Industry ===
Da Nang is a diversified industrial center, including industries such as machinery, electrics, chemicals, shipbuilding, and textiles. Specific industrial products include aquatic products, fabric, clothes, bricks, fertilizer, cement, soap, paper, and medical tablets. The city&#x27;s industry may diversify further. EADS is planning to set up an industrial park focused on the aviation industry in Da Nang.

As of 2007, Da Nang industry was dominated by the state sector, which made up 57% of gross output. This is about the same as its share in 2000. Over 80% of the state industry is centrally managed (in other words: belongs to state corporations headquartered in Hanoi). Almost half of the rest is contributed by the foreign-invested sector, while the private domestic sector is still relatively small and has not been able to significantly increase its share compared to the state sector. Industry grew by an average of 14.8% per year from 2000 to 2007, making it the main engine of economic growth. However, it has the second lowest industrial growth rate in the South Central Coast (behind only Khanh Hoa Province). Employment has grown at an average of 5.75%, reaching 118,900 in 2007.

=== Trade ===
Historically, Da Nang&#x27;s main marketplace has been the Hàn Market (), which is downtown near the west bank of the Hàn River, between Tran Phu and Bach Dang Streets.

=== Tourism ===

The tourism sector is a vital component of Da Nang&#x27;s economy. Its status as a transportation hub for central Vietnam and its proximity to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Imperial City of Hue, the Old Town of Hoi An, and the My Son ruins fuels much of its tourist activity.

Mỹ Sơn is an archaeological site dating back more than a thousand years, in Quang Nam. Located in a remote forested valley some 70 km west of Da Nang, this former capital and religious center of the Champa kingdom once contained in excess of 70 style temples and stupas. Although badly damaged by bombing raids in the 1960s, the site still has more than 20 structures and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999. Many statues, sculptures and reliefs recovered from Mỹ Sơn are kept in the Museum of Cham Sculpture, near the Hàn River in the heart of Da Nang. Dating from the fourth to the 14th centuries, the sensual artwork on these works depicts daily activities as well as Hindu and Buddhist religious themes.

The Marble Mountains are rocky limestone outcrops jutting out of the beach just south of Da Nang. Paths lead to the top of the forested cliffs, providing views of Non Nuoc Beach and the South China Sea. The caves in the cliffs were originally inhabited by the Cham people. Later, the Nguyen dynasty built numerous pagodas among the caves. The Marble Mountains are home to various artisans producing sculpture and artwork at its base at Non Nuoc Village.

Non Nuoc Beach is a white sandy beach on the outskirts of Đà Nẵng that is renowned for its history as an R&amp;R destination for American troops during the Vietnam War. Today, the beach, along with Mỹ Khê beach to the north, are home to expensive resorts, surfing, and entertainment facilities. Ba Na Hills is a mountain resort with a 5 km-long cable car system which carries guests up to Ba Na&#x27;s peak at 1487m above sea level. Son Tra Mountain, just some miles away from the city centre with some wild streams and resorts along the seaside. 

The central coastal city of Da Nang saw a significant growth in international tourist arrivals in 2017, according to the city&#x27;s Department of Tourism. In 2017, about 6.6 million visitors came to Da Nang, up 19% over the previous year and 4.8% higher than its yearly target. The figure included 4.3 million domestic tourists, up 11.3% year-on-year.

The central city earned over VND19.4 trillion (US$853.96 million) in revenue, an increase of 20.6% from 2016. Statistics also show that the city witnessed an impressive increase in the number of visitors by air which stood at over 1.58 million, up 74.4% while by-car visitors via Thailand and Laos was estimated at 14,120.

In 2016, Da Nang was voted one of the top 10 resort destinations in Asia by readers of Smart Travel Asia magazine.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transportation ===

Đà Nẵng is at the end of the East–West Economic Corridor (EWEC), which stretches over Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Burma (Myanmar). The city Department of Transport has asked Yokohama City, Japan, to cooperate in transit-oriented development.

==== By air ====
Da Nang International Airport, located at the centre of the city, is the third largest international airport in Vietnam. It is an important gateway to access central Vietnam. The airport was known as Da Nang Air Base during the Vietnam War, during which time it was described as the world&#x27;s busiest airport. During the month of May 1968, the base reached an average of 2,595 air traffic operations daily, more than any airport in the world. As of June 2011, the airport has domestic connections to Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Haiphong, Vinh, Buon Ma Thuot, Da Lat, Nha Trang, and Can Tho, as well as international connections to Seoul (South Korea), Tokyo (Japan), Singapore, and Taipei (Taiwan).

Beginning 16 December 2011, Air Asia, a Malaysian low-cost carrier, began offering four flights a week between Đà Nẵng and Kuala Lumpur. A new international terminal opened in December 2011 allowing further connections to destinations such as Phnom Penh (Cambodia), Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan, and Australia.

As of November 2015, Da Nang International airport has been undergoing extensive renovations.

==== By land ====


Da Nang is a major station along the North–South Railway, also known as the Reunification Express.

National Highways 1 and 14B run through the city, providing road connections to Hanoi in the north and Ho Chi Minh City in the south, as well as the Central Highlands and Laos to the west. The Hai Pass is a mountain pass separating Da Nang and Huế, where Highway 1A passes through. To cut down on transit time and the danger to motorists from navigating the twisting mountain road, the Hải Vân Tunnel was built, opening in 2005. It is the longest tunnel in south-east Asia at 6.28 km, and allows motorists to save between 30 minutes and an hour on traveling times over the old Hải Vân Pass route. An expressway between Da Nang and nearby Quang Ngai has completed its construction in 2018.

Several bridges cross the Han River and its tributaries in Da Nang, including the iconic Han River Bridge, Tran Thi Ly Bridge, Nguyen Van Troi Bridge, Tuyen Son Bridge and the recently completed Thuan Phuoc Bridge, which is the longest suspension bridge in Vietnam. The Dragon River Bridge will cross the Han River at the Le Dinh Duong/Bach Dang roundabout, offering tourists coming from Đà Nẵng International Airport a more direct route to My Khe and Non Nuoc beaches, along the city&#x27;s eastern edge.

Da Nang&#x27;s port system is the third largest in Vietnam after Ho Chi Minh City and Haiphong. In 2008, Da Nang&#x27;s port handled 2.7 million tons of cargo, of which 1.2 million tons were exports, 525,900 tons were imports, and 985,600 tons were domestic cargo. Over 29,600 passengers passed through the port in 2008, a significant increase over previous years. The port system consists of two areas: Tiên Sa Seaport, and Song Hàn Terminal. Tien Sa Seaport has a navigation depth of , and is able to receive medium range tankers of up to 45,000 DWT, as well as container ships and large cruise ships. The approach to Song Hàn Terminal is long with a navigation depth of , and can accommodate vessels of up to 5,000 DWT. Vietnam National Shipping Lines (Vinalines) is the port authority for Đà Nẵng&#x27;s port system.

<text>Robert Henry Lawrence Jr. (October 2, 1935 – December 8, 1967) was a United States Air Force officer and the first African-American astronaut.

==Early years==
Born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, Lawrence attended Haines Elementary School and, at age sixteen, graduated in the top 10 percent from Englewood High School in 1952. Four years later in 1956, he graduated from Bradley University with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry. At Bradley, Lawrence became a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity and distinguished himself as Cadet Commander in the Air Force ROTC and received the commission of second lieutenant in the Air Force Reserve Program.

==Air Force==
At the age of 21, he was designated as a U.S. Air Force pilot after completing flight training at Malden Air Force Base, Missouri.

At 22, he married Barbara Cress, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Henry Cress of Chicago. By the time he was 25, he had completed an Air Force assignment as an instructor pilot in the T-33 training aircraft for the German Air Force.

In 1965, Lawrence earned a PhD in physical chemistry from Ohio State University. His doctoral thesis was &quot;The Mechanism Of The Tritium Beta Ray Induced Exchange Reaction Of Deuterium With Methane and Ethane In The Gas Phase&quot;.

He was a senior USAF pilot, accumulating well over 2,500 flight hours, 2,000 of which were in jets. Lawrence flew many tests in the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter to investigate the gliding flight of various unpowered spacecraft returning to Earth from orbit, such as the North American X-15 rocket-plane. NASA cited Lawrence for accomplishments and flight maneuver data that &quot;contributed greatly to the development of the Space Shuttle.&quot;

==Astronaut==

In June 1967, Lawrence successfully completed the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (Class 66B) at Edwards AFB, California. The same month, he was selected by the USAF as an astronaut in the Air Force&#x27;s Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL) program, thus becoming the country&#x27;s first black astronaut.

Lawrence and other MOL astronauts laughed when asked at the announcement &quot;Will you have to sit in the back seat of the capsule?&quot; When asked if his selection was historic for race relations in the United States, Lawrence answered &quot;No, I don&#x27;t think so. It&#x27;s another one of those things that we look forward to in civil rights — normal progression.&quot; He said that he had faced problems like other black people, but &quot;Perhaps I have been more fortunate than the others in the opportunities.&quot; Donald H. Peterson, chosen for MOL with Lawrence, said &quot;I can&#x27;t speak for all the people in Mississippi&quot; but that he was not reluctant to work with a black man.

==Death and legacy==
At age 32, Lawrence was killed in a plane crash at Edwards AFB on December 8, 1967. He was flying backseat in an F-104 as the instructor pilot for flight test trainee Major Harvey Royer, who was learning the steep-descent glide technique. Royer made such an approach but flared too late.

The airplane struck the ground hard, its main gear failed, it caught fire, and rolled. The canopy shattered and the plane bounced and skidded on the runway for . Major Royer ejected upward and survived, with major injuries. The back seat, which delays a moment to avoid hitting the front seat, ejected sideways, killing Lawrence instantly. He was still strapped to his ejector seat; his parachute failed to open and was dragged from the wreck.

Had Lawrence lived, he likely would have been among the MOL astronauts who became NASA Astronaut Group 7 after MOL&#x27;s cancellation, all of whom flew on the Space Shuttle.

During his brief career, Lawrence earned the Air Force Commendation Medal, the Outstanding Unit Citation. On December 8, 1997, his name was inscribed on the Space Mirror Memorial at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The 13th Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft, which launched on February 15, 2020, was named the S.S. &quot;Robert H. Lawrence&quot; in his honor.

The artist Tavares Strachan dedicated his satellite sculpture ENOCH, launched in 2018, to Lawrence.

In 2020, NASA included Lawrence in a group of 27 pioneering African-American, Hispanic, and Native American astronauts to commemorate by naming asteroids after them. The asteroid, Robertlawrence 92892, is located in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

In 2024, his alma mater, Bradley University, announced an art installation commemorating Lawrence to be installed February 2025.

<text>Clifton Curtis Williams Jr. (September 26, 1932 – October 5, 1967), was an American naval aviator, test pilot, mechanical engineer, major in the United States Marine Corps, and NASA astronaut, who was killed in a plane crash; he never went into space. The crash was caused by a mechanical failure in a NASA T-38 jet trainer, which he was piloting to visit his parents in Mobile, Alabama. The failure caused the flight controls to stop responding, and although he activated the ejection seat, it did not save him. He was the fourth astronaut from NASA&#x27;s Astronaut Group 3 to have died, the first two (Charles Bassett and Theodore Freeman) having been killed in separate T-38 flights, and the third (Roger B. Chaffee) in the Apollo 1 fire earlier that year. The aircraft crashed in Florida near Tallahassee within an hour of departing Patrick AFB.

Before becoming an astronaut, Williams received his Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Auburn University in 1954 and joined the U.S. Marine Corps through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC). He became a Naval Aviator in 1956 and joined the Fleet Marine Force. In 1961, he graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. As a test pilot, he worked for three years in the Carrier Suitability Branch of the Flight Test Division at NAS Patuxent River. In 1962, Williams, then a Captain, became the first pilot to land a two-seat jet on the aircraft carrier from the rear cockpit. At the time of his death, he was 35 and held the rank of Major.

Although he was never on a spaceflight, he served as backup pilot for the mission Gemini 10, which took place in July 1966. Following this mission, he was selected to be the Lunar Module Pilot for an Apollo mission to the Moon commanded by Pete Conrad. Following Williams&#x27; death, Alan Bean became Lunar Module Pilot for Conrad&#x27;s mission, which ended up being Apollo 12, the second lunar landing. In his honor—on Bean&#x27;s suggestion—the mission patch had four stars instead of three; one for each of three astronauts and one for Williams. Also, Bean placed Williams&#x27; naval aviator wings and silver astronaut pin to rest on the lunar surface during his moonwalk.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Williams was born on September 26, 1932, in Mobile, Alabama, to parents Clifton Curtis Williams Sr. (1909–1968) and Gertrude () Williams (1913–2002). He had a younger brother, Richard, born in 1935. Williams was active in the Boy Scouts of America, where he achieved its second-highest rank, Life Scout. Williams attended Murphy High School in Mobile, graduating in 1949. For the next two years he attended Spring Hill College, studying medicine, but transferred to Auburn University, from where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering in 1954.

===Flight experience===
Upon graduation in 1954, he received his commission in the U.S. Marine Corps through the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (Navy ROTC) on August 9, 1954, and subsequently reported to The Basic School at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, and after completing it, he was sent to NAS Pensacola, Florida, for flight training. He became a naval aviator in August 1956, and served with operational tactical jet squadrons of the Fleet Marine Force. He then attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. Following graduation from USNTPS in June 1961, as part of Class 28, he was test pilot for three years in the Carrier Suitability Branch of the Flight Test Division at NAS Patuxent River. His work there included both land-based and shipboard tests of the F-8E, TF-8A, F-8E (attack), and A-4E aircraft and the automatic carrier landing system. In 1962, as project officer on the F-8 Crusader new jet trainer, Williams, then a captain, became the first pilot to land a two-seat jet on the aircraft carrier from the rear cockpit.

While at NAS Patuxent River, he was selected for the NASA astronaut program in the third group of prospective Gemini and Apollo astronauts in late 1963.

Of the 2,500 hours flying time he accumulated, more than 2,100 hours were in jet aircraft.
===NASA career===
On October 18, 1963, Major Williams was named by NASA as one of its third group of astronauts, along with thirteen others. This group included Buzz Aldrin, who took part in the first lunar landing in 1969, as well as Roger B. Chaffee, who died in the Apollo 1 fire in 1967.

The third group of astronauts performed jungle training. Williams partnered with Rusty Schweickart.

Williams served as the backup pilot for Gemini 10, which took place in July 1966. Later that year, Pete Conrad chose Williams to be the Lunar Module Pilot on the mission for which Conrad was commander, which would serve as the back-up Apollo 9 crew, and later become Apollo 12. After his death, his position on Conrad&#x27;s crew was filled by Alan Bean, who had been his commander on the Gemini 10 backup crew.

===Marriage and children===
Williams was the first bachelor astronaut, which changed when he married Jane Elizabeth &quot;Beth&quot; Lansche, a former waterskiing performer at the Cypress Gardens theme park in Florida. Upon the announcement of their engagement, the press feigned disappointment over the loss of the nation&#x27;s only bachelor astronaut. The couple met in June 1957, and were married on July 1, 1964, in St. Paul&#x27;s Catholic Church in New Bern, North Carolina, which was Lansche&#x27;s hometown. The couple had two children. Their first daughter, Catherine Ann, was born on January 6, 1967. Their second daughter, Jane Dee Williams, was born on May 31, 1968, nearly eight months after Williams&#x27; death.

===Death===
On October 5, 1967, Williams was flying from Cape Canaveral back to Houston, with a stop in Mobile to visit his father who was dying of cancer. A mechanical failure caused the aileron controls to jam on his T-38 jet trainer near Tallahassee, Florida, causing an uncontrollable aileron roll. The aircraft dove straight down, between pine trees apart, and crashed without touching them, although it did singe them from a fire caused by the crash. The jet was flying at when it performed a sudden roll to the left and dove nearly vertically into the earth at .

Williams ejected at an altitude of , but the aircraft was traveling too fast and too low for the seat to land safely. An Air Force spokesman stated, &quot;The plane disintegrated and the body disintegrated with it.&quot;

==Honors==

The Apollo 12 mission patch has four stars on it: one each for the three astronauts who flew the mission, and one for Williams (at Alan Bean&#x27;s suggestion). Also, his naval aviator wings and silver astronaut pin were placed to rest on the lunar surface in his honor, left there by astronaut Bean during Apollo 12 in November 1969.

Williams was buried with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery. Williams&#x27; name appears on NASA&#x27;s Space Mirror Memorial at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

In the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, Williams was played by Jim Leavy.

<text>The Mennonite Church in the Netherlands, or Algemene Doopsgezinde Sociëteit, is a body of Mennonite Christians in the Netherlands.
The Mennonites (or &quot;Mennisten&quot; or &quot;Doopsgezinden&quot;) are named for Menno Simons (1496–1561), a Dutch Roman Catholic priest from the province of Friesland who converted to Anabaptism around 1536. He was re-baptized as an adult in 1537 and became part (and soon leader) of the Dutch Anabaptist movement.

In 1811, different regional churches merged to form the Algemene Doopsgezinde Sociëteit (&quot;doopsgezind&quot;, &quot;baptist-minded&quot;). The Mennonite Church in the Netherlands is a member of the Mennonite World Conference and in 2015 reported 7,230 members in 111 congregations.

==General characteristics==
The &quot;doopsgezinden&quot; (&quot;baptist-minded&quot;) or the Algemene Doopsgezinde Sociëteit (General Baptism-minded Society) are a religious community in the Netherlands that can be considered the Dutch branch of the Mennonites. In the Netherlands they are at times also called Mennists.

The current Dutch name &quot;doopsgezinden&quot; arose around 1800 to replace earlier names, like &quot;mennonieten/me(n)nisten&quot; or &quot;dopersen&quot;. The name refers to the movement&#x27;s specific views on baptism. Rather than baptizing infants as is usual in many other denominations, baptism is reserved for adults. Prior to baptism a person writes a personal statement of confession and becomes a full member of the community upon being baptized. The confession is not necessarily based on any prescribed forms or dogmatic rules, in contrast to what is customary in the &quot;Protestantse Kerk in Nederland&quot;, the largest Protestant denomination in the country; a denomination that unifies a number of Calvinist and Lutheran traditions.

Another characteristic of the doopsgezinden is that they reject military service and the bearing of arms. In the past, this stance has extended to all service for the state. In the days of the Dutch Republic, this position brought the community into conflict with local and Stadholderly authorities, because the church members refused to participate in the city&#x27;s militia. In place of such service, however, they often did participate and contribute to the fire brigades in many places.

==History==

===Founding years===
Mennonites are the followers of Menno Simons (1496–1561), who was born in Witmarsum, Friesland. Simons is considered one of the best known leaders of the Reformation alongside Luther, Calvin and Zwingli. Simons is the only widely recognized Reformer of Dutch descent.

Anabaptism appeared in the Netherlands by 1530, when Melchior Hoffman (1495–1543) visited Emden in East Frisia. While there, Hoffman baptized more than 100 adults who converted to Anabaptism. The early years saw a number of, at times, rather fanatical, even violent, developments under Anabaptist-associated groups, like the Batenburgers. A similar violent take-over of the city of Münster was subsequently repressed.

===After 1536===
After the demise of the Anabaptist rule in Münster (1534–1536, under Jan van Leiden), Menno Simons became the pivotal person who inspired the movement known as the (Ana)baptists. This movement was fiercely repressed and persecuted by many, including the Lutheran church. After 1536, Menno Simons was mostly active in organizing congregations in what are now the German states of Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, but congregations were also founded in his homeland of the Netherlands.

===16th and 17th centuries===
Soon after Menno&#x27;s death, his followers in the Netherlands split into a number of local factions. There were Waterlandic, Frisian and Flemish denominations. In the second half of the 16th century many Frisian and Flemish Mennonites from the Netherlands moved to the Vistula Delta, where they established settlements that flourished until the 1770s. Many of these Vistula delta Mennonites later moved to the Russian Empire and from there to North and Latin America. Today there several hundred thousands of these so-called Russian Mennonites, who are of Dutch descent and speak Plautdietsch.

After 1664, there was another schism. One of the groups was founded by the preacher Galenus Abraham de Haen from Zierikzee. Members of that group are known as the &quot;Lammists.&quot; A different group, known as the &quot;Sonnists,&quot; arose under the preacher Samuel Apostool. Lammists were more liberal and Sonnists were stricter. In 1735, the Sonnists founded their own Mennonite seminary in Amsterdam. In 1801, the two groups united again.

During the Republic, which was dominated by Calvinism, the Menists found themselves in a position similar to that of the Jews and the Catholics. They were tolerated as long as they did not practice their religion too openly. Churches had to be built in inconspicuous places, hidden from view. In some places, they can still be found in the middle of a block &quot;behind&quot; the houses, e.g. in Grouw, Haarlem, Deventer and Joure. In this period, the community was mostly of an orthodox nature as the usual name of the churches the “Vermaning” (Admonition) indicates. Many walks of life and professions were not open to the community, e.g. they were not admitted into the guilds. Many members, therefore, became merchants or earned their living in financial services. In the heyday of the Dutch Republic, the Golden Age of the seventeenth century, many of the Menists came into considerable wealth. The region of the river Vecht above Utrecht is still known as the &quot;Menists&#x27; Heaven&quot;, because of its many opulent mansions.

===18th century and the Napoleonic period===
From the 18th century onward, many Menists evolved from a rather orthodox view to a decidedly liberal one. At the end of the century, there was considerable upheaval and the &quot;patriots&quot; inspired by events in the American colonies strove for sweeping reform in the rather archaic institutions of the Republic. In the Batavian Revolution of 1795, a disproportionately large number of &#x27;doopsgezinden&#x27;, as they started to call themselves, could be found amongst the &quot;patriots&quot; and they played an active role in the emancipation of groups that, like themselves, had been excluded from full citizenship. In 1806, the old guilds were finally abolished and all professions became open to the Menists. However, the customary right to refuse military service was now denied them.

===19th century===
In the century that followed, many of the more orthodox members of the &#x27;doopsgezinden&#x27; decided to leave and join the more conservative Dutch Reformed Church. The remaining Mennists acquired a more and more progressive signature, quite in contrast to their fellow Mennists overseas.

Mission work among the group also began in the 19th century, carrying into the early 20th century. The group chose Central Java and New Guinea as mission fields. Strong ties still exist between these communities (now in Indonesia) and today&#x27;s Dutch groups.

===Modern church===
The Mennonite Church was the first denomination in the Netherlands to allow women to be ordained as ministers. The church first adopted acceptance of women to the priesthood in 1905. In 1911, Anne Zernike became the first woman minister in the country. Her ministry started in the Frisian town of Bovenknijpe (near Heerenveen).

By 2007, there were 118 &quot;Doopsgezinde&quot; congregations with a total of 8,362 members. These were located mostly in the provinces Friesland and North Holland, and in cities along the river IJssel. In 2015 they had 7,230 members in 111 congregations.

Together with the Remonstrants, the Algemeene Doopsgezinde Societeit church was also the first church to accept and perform same-sex marriage in the service, before such was legalized in the Netherlands in 2001. The first gay marriage took place in 1986 and was the first in the world. They continue to both ordain gay people and conduct homosexual marriages in their congregations.

<text>This is a list of Saskatchewan&#x27;s highways:

Only Highways 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, and 39 contain sections of divided highway. Speed limits range from . Saskatchewan is the only province bordering the United States with no direct connection to the Interstate Highway System.

== Named routes ==
* Can Am Highway
*Circle Drive
*Hanson Lake Road
*Little Swan Road
*Louis Riel Trail
*McBride Lake Road
*Northern Woods and Water Route
*Ring Road
*Red Coat Trail
*Regina Bypass
*Saskatoon Freeway
*Saskota Travel Route
* Trans-Canada Highway
*Veterans Memorial Highway
* Yellowhead Highway

== Primary (1–99) ==
These are primary highways maintained by the provincial government. Almost all of these highways are paved for most of their length. Highways 1, 11, and 16 are the most important highways and are divided highways for much of their lengths, with some sections at expressway or freeway standards.


































== Northern (100–199) ==
Major northern highways, usually corresponding to a &quot;parent&quot; 1-99 highway.





== Secondary ==
=== 200–299 ===
These are usually highways connecting from a &quot;parent&quot; 1-99 highway to a recreational area.







=== 300–399 ===
These are usually highways connecting from a &quot;parent&quot; 1-99 highway to minor communities near the &quot;parent&quot; route.





















== Municipal roads ==
=== 600–699 ===

The 600-series highways are minor highways that run north and south; generally, the last two digits increase from east to west. Highway 600 is near the eastern border with Manitoba and Highway 699 is near the western border with Alberta. Many of these highways are gravel for some of their length.

=== 700–799 ===

The 700-series highways are minor highways that run east and west; generally, the last two digits increase from south to north. Many of these highways are gravel for some of their length.

== Northern secondary (900–999) ==
These are roads that generally provide access to isolated, northern communities. Most of these highways are unpaved for their entire length.

<doc id="425157" wikidata="Q7094933" url="?curid=425157" title="Ontario Universities' Application Centre">
<text>The Ontario Universities&#x27; Application Centre (OUAC) () is a non-profit organization based in Guelph that processes online applications for admission to universities in Ontario, Canada. It was founded in 1971 by the Council of Ontario Universities and the Ontario Universities&#x27; Council on Admissions, to reduce the duplication and costs involved in processing applications.

The OUAC processes applications to undergraduate programs, medical school, law school, teacher education, and rehabilitation sciences programs at nearly all of Ontario&#x27;s universities - only the RMC does not process applications through the OUAC.

==History==

The OUAC was founded in 1971 by the Committee of Presidents of the Universities of Ontario, now called the Council of Ontario Universities, and the Ontario Universities’ Council on Admissions (OUCA).

Before the OUAC was formed, each university processed its own applications. Students could accept offers of admission to more than one university, which left universities with vacant spots in the fall (since students were not required to notify the universities they had decided not to attend). Processing all applications in one place meant less duplication and costs. Since the 1970s, the OUAC has expanded its services to include publications, transcript distribution, surveys, data collection and statistical reports used by governments and universities.

In 1972, the OUAC processed more than 135,000 undergraduate applications. Today, more than 200,000 applicants submit approximately 600,000 applications to the OUAC every year. By 2012, the OUAC had processed more than 14 million applications, submitted by more than 4.5 million applicants.

Starting in 1975, the OUAC began processing applications to professional programs, including medicine (1975), teacher education (1979), law (1997) and rehabilitation sciences (2000). Each program has its own application service. These services were developed by admissions officers at the respective universities to reduce duplication and save time and money for the applicants and the universities.

In 2003, during the double cohort year when the last group of Grade 13 students graduated at the same time as Grade 12 students, the OUAC received 86,000 online applications in two months.

Applications were paper-based until the late 1990s. By 2011, 99 percent of all applications were completed online.

==Funding==

The OUAC is a non-profit agency funded through student application fees and the contract services it provides for the universities. After all costs are recovered, the OUAC gives any remaining revenue to the universities to help with their admissions processing costs.

==Primary role==

The OUAC processes English and French applications for undergraduate and professional programs (medicine, law, teacher education, and rehabilitation sciences), and graduate programs at some universities in Ontario.

===Secondary roles===
* Maintaining the Ontario Universities&#x27; Info website (in English and French), a searchable database of information on all Ontario university programs, including admission requirements, scholarships, etc.

<text>Microbicides for [[sexually transmitted infection]]s are pharmacologic agents and chemical substances that are capable of killing or destroying certain microorganisms that commonly cause sexually transmitted infection (for example, the human immunodeficiency virus).

Microbicides are a diverse group of chemical compounds that exert their activity by a variety of different mechanisms of action.
Multiple compounds are being developed and tested for their microbicidal activity in clinical trials. Microbicides can be formulated in various delivery systems including gels, creams, lotions, aerosol sprays, tablets or films (which must be used near the time of sexual intercourse) and sponges and vaginal rings (or other devices that release the active ingredient(s) over a longer period). Some of these agents are being developed for vaginal application, and for rectal use by those engaging in anal sex.

Although there are many approaches to preventing sexually transmitted infections in general (and HIV in particular), current methods have not been sufficient to halt the spread of these infections (particularly among women and people in less-developed nations). Sexual abstinence is not a realistic option for women who want to bear children, or who are at risk of sexual violence. In such situations, the use of microbicides could offer both primary protection (in the absence of condoms) and secondary protection (if a condom breaks or slips off during intercourse). It is hoped that microbicides may be safe and effective in reducing the risk of HIV transmission during sexual activity with an infected partner.

==Mechanisms of action==

=== Detergents ===
Detergent and surfactant microbicides such as nonoxynol-9, sodium dodecyl sulfate and Savvy (1.0% C31G), act by disrupting the viral envelope, capsid or lipid membrane of microorganisms. Since detergent microbicides also kill host cells and impair the barrier function of healthy mucosal surfaces, they are less desirable than other agents. Additionally, clinical trials have not demonstrated these agents to be effective at preventing HIV transmission. Consequently, laboratory and clinical trials testing this class of products as microbicides have largely been discontinued.

===Vaginal defense enhancers===
Healthy vaginal pH is typically quite acidic, with a pH value of around 4. However, the alkaline pH of semen can neutralize vaginal pH. One potential class of microbicides acts by reducing the pH of vaginal secretions, which may kill (or otherwise inactivate) pathogenic microorganisms. One such agent is BufferGel, a spermicidal and microbicidal gel formulated to maintain the natural protective acidity of the vagina. Candidates in this category (including BufferGel) have proven to be ineffective in preventing HIV infection.

===Polyanions===

The polyanion category of microbicides includes the carrageenans. Carrageenans are a family of linear sulfated polysaccharides chemically related to heparan sulfate, which many microbes utilize as a biochemical receptor for initial attachment to the cell membrane. Thus, carrageenan and other microbicides of its class act as decoy receptors for viral binding.

&quot;Carrageenan&quot; preparations (such as 0.5% PRO 2000 and 3% Carraguard vaginal microbicide gels) have failed to demonstrate efficacy in preventing HIV transmission in phase III clinical multicenter trials. PRO 2000 was demonstrated to be safe, but it did not reduce the risk of HIV infection in women (as explained in the MDP 301 trial results, released in December 2009). Similarly, the phase III efficacy trial of Carraguard showed that the drug was safe for use but ineffective in preventing HIV transmission in women.

&quot;Cellulose sulfate&quot; is another microbicide found ineffective in preventing the transmission of HIV. On February 1, 2007, the International AIDS Society announced that two phase III trials of cellulose sulfate had been stopped because preliminary results suggested a potential increased risk of HIV in women who used the compound. There is no satisfactory explanation as to why application of cellulose sulfate was associated with a higher risk of HIV infection than placebo. According to a review of microbicide drug candidates by the World Health Organization on March 16, 2007, a large number of compounds (more than 60 in early 2007) are under development; at the beginning of that year, five phase III trials testing different formulations were underway.

===Nanoscale dendrimers===

VivaGel is a sexual lubricant with antiviral properties manufactured by Australian pharmaceutical company Starpharma. The active ingredient is a nanoscale dendrimeric molecule (which binds to viruses and prevents them from affecting an organism&#x27;s cells). Experimental results with VivaGel indicate 85–100% effectiveness at blocking transmission of both HIV and genital herpes in macaque monkeys. It has passed the animal-testing phases of the drug-approval process in Australia and the United States, which will be followed by initial human safety tests. The National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases have awarded grants totaling $25.7 million for VivaGel&#x27;s development and testing. VivaGel is being developed as a standalone microbicide gel and an intra-vaginal microbicide. It is also being evaluated for use in condoms. It is hoped that VivaGel will provide an extra resource to mitigate the sub-Saharan AIDS pandemic.

It is also hoped that microbicides will block the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, such as those caused by certain human papillomaviruses (HPV) and herpes simplex viruses (HSV). In 2009, Starpharma released its results for a study investigating VivaGel&#x27;s antiviral activity against HIV and HSV in humans by testing cervico-vaginal samples &quot;in vitro&quot; (in a test tube). The compound displayed a high level of efficacy against HIV and HSV. While the results are encouraging, the study did not evaluate VivaGel&#x27;s effect in the body. It is still unknown what the results mean for women who would use the product in real-life settings; for example, the effect of sexual intercourse (or semen) on the gel (which often affects the protective properties of a drug) is unknown. The CAPRISA 004 trial demonstrated that topical tenofovir gel provided 51% protection against HSV-2.

===Antiretrovirals===

Researchers have begun to focus on another class of microbicides, the antiretroviral (ARV) agents. ARVs work either by preventing the HIV virus from entering a human host cell, or by preventing its replication after it has already entered. Examples of ARV drugs being tested for prevention include tenofovir, dapivirine (a diarylpyrimidine inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase) and UC-781. These next-generation microbicides have received attention and support because they are based on the same ARV drugs currently used to extend the survival (and improve the quality of life) of HIV-positive people. ARVs are also used to prevent vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child during childbirth, and are used to prevent HIV infection from developing immediately after exposure to the virus. Such ARV-based compounds could be formulated into topical microbicides to be administered locally in the rectum or vagina or systemically through oral or injectable formulations (pre-exposure prophylaxis). ARV-based microbicides may be formulated as long-acting vaginal rings, gels and films. The results of the first efficacy trial of an ARV-based microbicide, CAPRISA 004, tested 1% tenofovir in gel form to prevent male-to-female HIV transmission. The trial showed that the gel (which was applied topically to the vagina), was 39% effective at preventing HIV transmission. CAPRISA 004 was the 12th microbicide-efficacy study to be completed, and the first to demonstrate a significant reduction in HIV transmission. The results of this trial are statistically significant and offer proof of concept that ARVs, topically applied to the vaginal mucosa, can offer protection against HIV (and other) pathogens.

==Formulations==

Most of the first generation microbicides were formulated as semi-solid systems, such as gels, tablets, films, or creams, and were designed to be applied to the vagina before every act of intercourse. However, vaginal rings have the potential to provide long-term controlled release of microbicide drugs. Long-acting formulations, like vaginal rings, are potentially advantageous since they could be easy to use, requiring replacement only once a month. This ease of use could prove very important to make sure that products are used properly. In 2010, the International Partnership for Microbicides began the first study in Africa to test the safety and acceptability of a vaginal ring containing dapivirine. Drugs might also be administered systemically through injectable or oral formulations known as PrEP. Injectable formulations may be desirable since they could be administered infrequently, possibly once a month. It is likely, however, that such products would need to be monitored closely and would be available only through prescription. This approach also carries the risk of emergence of ARV-resistant strains of HIV.

Substantial numbers of men who have sex with men in developed countries use lubricants containing nonoxynol-9. This suggests that they might be receptive to the concept of using topical rectal microbicides if such products were to become commercially available. However, the development of rectal microbicides is not as advanced as that of vaginal microbicides. One reason for this is that the rectum has a thinner epithelium, greater surface area and lower degree of elasticity than that of the vagina. Due to these factors, a microbicidal preparation that is effective when applied vaginally might have a different degree of effectiveness when applied rectally. In January 2010, the National Institutes of Health awarded two grants totaling $17.5 million to the University of Pittsburgh to fund research into rectal microbicides. That research will include investigations into product acceptability of rectal microbicides with homosexual men ages 18 to 30 years old.

Ultimately, successful topical microbicides might simultaneously employ multiple modes of action. In fact, long-acting formulations such as vaginal rings could provide the technology needed to deliver multiple active ingredients with different mechanisms of action.

==Completed clinical trials==

A major breakthrough in microbicide research, announced in July 2010, reported that an ARV-based microbicide gel could partially prevent HIV. A trial led by the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), conducted in South Africa, demonstrated that the ARV tenofovir, when used in a vaginal gel, was 39% effective at preventing HIV transmission from men to women during sex.

=== Tenofovir gel ===

In July 2010 the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) released results of a study establishing proof of concept that an ARV-based, topical microbicide can reduce the likelihood of HIV transmission. The trial, CAPRISA 004, was conducted among 889 women to evaluate the ability of 1% tenofovir gel to prevent male-to-female HIV transmission. The study found a 39% lower HIV infection rate in women using 1% tenofovir gel compared with women using a placebo gel. In addition, tenofovir gel was shown to be safe as tested. The results of the CAPRISA 004 trial provide statistically significant evidence that ARVs, topically applied to the vaginal mucosa, can offer protection against HIV and (potentially) other pathogens. During the study, 38 of the women who used the tenofovir gel acquired HIV and 60 women who used a placebo gel became HIV-infected. No tenofovir-resistant virus was detected in the women who acquired HIV infection during the study. In addition to demonstrating efficacy against HIV, CAPRISA 004 found evidence that tenofovir gel also prevents the transmission of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-2 is a lifelong, incurable infection which can make those infected with the virus two-to-three times more likely to acquire HIV. Data collected during the CAPRISA 004 study indicate that tenofovir gel provided 51% protection against HSV-2. Tenofovir, developed by Gilead Sciences, is a nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) which interferes with the replication of HIV and is approved in tablet form for use in combination with other ARVs to treat HIV. CAPRISA 004 was a collaboration among CAPRISA, Family Health International and CONRAD. It was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the South African Department of Science and Technology&#x27;s Technology Innovation Agency.

=== PRO 2000 ===
Results released in February 2009 from a clinical trial of PRO 2000 (Indevus Pharmaceuticals), a vaginal-microbicide gel (0.5%), sparked hope that it might provide modest protection against HIV. The results of a larger trial released in December 2009 showed that PRO 2000 was safe as administered, but was ineffective in reducing the risk of HIV infection. That trial (MDP 301) was sponsored by the Microbicides Development Programme. MDP 301 was conducted in South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia with more than 9,300 women volunteers. No significant difference was found in the number of women who contracted HIV in the group given PRO 2000 compared to the group given a placebo. While this trial did not result in an effective product, it served as a model for future HIV-prevention trials; it provided scientific information and lessons from its social-science component, community engagement and preparation undertaken by the trial staff.

=== Carrageenan ===
Carrageenan may prevent HPV and HSV transmission, but not HIV. See Carrageenan#Medical Uses

The phase III clinical trial for carrageenan-based Carraguard showed that it had no statistical effect on HIV infection, according to results released in 2008. The study showed that the gel was safe, with no side effects or increased risks. The trial also provided information about usage patterns in trial participants.

=== Nonoxynol-9 ===

Nonoxynol-9, a spermicide, is ineffective as a topical microbicide in preventing HIV infection. Although nonoxynol-9 has been shown to increase the risk of HIV infection when used frequently by women at high risk of infection, it remains a contraceptive option for women at low risk.

==Current research==
Efforts are underway to develop safe and effective topical microbicides. Several different gel formulations are currently undergoing testing in phase III clinical efficacy trials, and about two dozen other products are in various phases of development. Results from CAPRISA 004, while promising, may need to be confirmed by other clinical trials before the microbicide tenofovir gel is made available to the public. This decision rests with regulators, particularly in South Africa. In 2013, the VOICE study (MTN 003), another large-scale trial, is scheduled to release results. VOICE is evaluating three different strategies to prevent HIV in women: one ARV-based microbicide and two regimens consisting of oral ARVs on a daily basis. The VOICE trial is testing 1% tenofovir vaginal gel in a once-daily formulation. It is not known at this time if VOICE will be considered a confirmatory trial for CAPRISA 004, which used a different dosing strategy. Products known as Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, or PrEP, are also being tested at various stages of the development process. These products, administered orally or via injection, would contain ARVs to protect HIV-negative people from becoming infected. Individuals would receive ARVs before they were exposed to HIV, with the goal of lowering their risk or preventing infection. One of the potential advantages of PrEP is that an individual could use it autonomously (without the need to negotiate with a partner), and it is not dependent on the time of sex. It is hoped that those unable to negotiate condom use with their sexual partners would be able to reduce their risk of HIV infection with the use of an oral (or injectable) prophylactic drug. Current PrEP candidates in development include tenofovir and Truvada (a combination of two ARV compounds, tenofovir and emtricitabine). One potential risk of the PrEP approach is that drugs present in systemic circulation might, over time, create ARV-resistant HIV strains.

==Social factors==
Condoms are an effective method for blocking the transmission of most sexually transmitted infections (with HPV a notable exception). However, a variety of social factors (including, but not limited to, the sexual disempowerment of women in many cultures) limit the feasibility of condom use. Thus, topical microbicides might provide a useful woman-initiated alternative to condoms.

Some sub-Saharan African cultures view vaginal lubrication as undesirable. Since some topical microbicide formulations currently under development function as lubricants, such &quot;dry sex&quot; traditions may pose a barrier to the implementation of topical microbicidal programs. Recent data on product acceptability, however, show that many men and women enjoy using gels during sex that would contain a microbicidal drug.

<doc id="425160" wikidata="Q306207" url="?curid=425160" title="IPod Mini">
<text>The iPod Mini (stylized and marketed as the iPod mini) is a discontinued, smaller digital audio player that was designed and marketed by Apple Inc. While it was sold, it was the midrange model in Apple&#x27;s iPod product line. It was announced on January 6, 2004, and released on February 20 of the same year. A second generation version was announced on February 23, 2005, and released immediately. While it was in production, it was one of the most popular electronic products on the market, with consumers often unable to find a retailer with the product in stock. The iPod Mini was discontinued on September 7, 2005 after 1-and-a-half years of being made, and was replaced by the iPod Nano.

The iPod Mini used the touch-sensitive scroll wheel of the third generation iPod. However, instead of the four touch buttons located above the wheel, the buttons were redesigned as mechanical switches beneath the wheel itself—hence the name &quot;click wheel&quot;. To use one of the four buttons, the user physically pushes the edge of the wheel inward over one of the four labels. Like its predecessors, the wheel was developed for Apple by Synaptics. The click wheel was also used in the fourth-, fifth- and sixth-generation iPods and the iPod Nano, from first generation through the fifth; however, in the Nano and 5G iPods onwards, the click wheel used was developed by Apple.

Above the wheel was a monochrome 138-by-110-pixel LCD that displayed a menu or information about the selected track. Newer-generation iPods have since adopted color displays.

==Models==
==Details==
The two generations of iPod Mini were almost identical apart from minor cosmetic differences. The first generation model has gray control symbols on the click wheel, while those on the second generation matched the color of the body while also having the storage capacity etched on the back. Their major functional differences lay in their storage capacity and battery life. Both versions were 3.6x2.0x0.5 inches (91x51x13 mm) and weigh 3.6 ounces (102 grams). The case consists of anodized aluminium. First generation iPod Minis were available in five colors: silver, gold, pink, blue, and green. The gold model was dropped from the second generation range, likely due to its unpopularity. The pink, blue, and green models received brighter hues in the second generation but the silver model remained unchanged.

The iPod Mini used Microdrive hard drives (CompactFlash II) made by Hitachi and Seagate. First generation models were available in a 4 GB size, while second generation models were available in both 4 GB and 6 GB versions (quoted as capable of storing roughly 1,000 and 1,500 songs, respectively) and eventually the second generation had the capacity laser etched into the aluminum case. 
The battery life for the first generation iPod Mini was criticized for its 8 hour duration, similar to the third generation iPod that was available at the time. Apple addressed this problem in the second generation models by increasing the battery life to about 18 hours, at the cost of removing the FireWire and AC adapter cables to avoid increasing selling costs. A proprietary dock connector was provided on the bottom of the device for a connection to a computer&#x27;s USB or FireWire port. The unit&#x27;s battery could be charged during connection. Along the top it had a hold switch, a headphone jack, and a remote connector for accessories.

Like the iPod Nano, the iPod Mini supported MP3, AAC/M4A, WAV, AIFF, and Apple Lossless audio formats. It also retained the iPod&#x27;s integration with iTunes and the iTunes Store, allowing for syncing between the software application and the iPod Mini.

==Modification==
Soon after the release of the iPod Mini, many third-party replacement batteries became available. By following one-of-many sets of online instructions detailing how to replace the battery, such as this one by iFixit, users could self replace the battery and so avoid having to send the iPod back to Apple, saving time and money. Many third-party batteries also claimed a higher capacity than the 450 mAh original stock battery – some claiming up to 1,300 mAh (though battery chemistry for Li-ion batteries has not advanced much during this period; it is highly unlikely that any would achieve such a capacity). As of January 2021, the most commonly advertised capacities of third-party batteries are 500 mAh and 750 mAh.

The iPod Mini could be flashed to run iPodLinux or Rockbox firmware which has support for extra codecs, games and various other plugins and allowed music placed directly on the iPod to be played without using iTunes. Users have replaced the 4 or 6 GB Microdrive with high capacity 8, 16, 32, 64 and even 256 GB CompactFlash and SD cards. Aside from increased capacity, this has the advantage of increasing battery life and making the Mini more durable since CompactFlash cards are solid-state with no moving parts.

==iPod Nano==

On September 7, 2005, Apple released the first generation iPod Nano. The Nano used flash memory to accomplish an even thinner casing, and featured a color screen. The headphone jack was moved to the bottom of the device, the dock connector shifted-off center, and the 4-pin remote connector was removed, among other changes. This caused the iPod Mini to be replaced by the iPod Nano.

<doc id="425164" wikidata="Q7099379" url="?curid=425164" title="Oral argument">
<text>Oral arguments are spoken presentations to a judge or appellate court by a lawyer (or parties when representing themselves) of the legal reasons why they should prevail. Oral argument at the appellate level accompanies written briefs, which also advance the argument of each party in the legal dispute. Oral arguments can also occur during motion practice when one of the parties presents a motion to the court for consideration before trial, such as when the case is to be dismissed on a point of law, or when summary judgment may lie because there are no factual issues in dispute.

Oral argument operates by each party in a case taking turns to speak directly to the judge or judges with an equal amount of time allotted to each. A party may often reserve part of their time to be used for rebuttal after their adversary has presented.

Presenting lawyers usually cannot simply make speeches or read their briefs when presenting oral argument to an appellate court. Unlike trial court procedure, where judges intervene only when asked by the parties to resolve objections, it is typical for judges at the appellate level to be active participants in oral argument, interrupting the presenting lawyers and asking questions. This is true even of courts that are formed of panels of multiple judges, such as the United States Supreme Court, where a presenting lawyer must be prepared to handle questions from any of the nine justices. It is also true that when a motion is made before or during trial that the lawyers conduct themselves before the judge in a manner similar to the presentation of the case on appeal, the lawyers present their arguments to the judge in a more conversational mode; in some pre-trial proceedings these appearances may not be recorded by court stenographers as they are invariably recorded in appellate proceedings.

Oral argument is not always considered an essential part of due process, as the briefs also give the parties an opportunity to be heard by the court. Whether a court will permit, require, or guarantee the opportunity to present oral argument is a decision usually left up to each court to decide as part of its rules of procedure, with differences from court to court even within a single jurisdiction. Some courts may guarantee the right to present oral argument, either requiring the parties to request to present or their waiver if they do not wish to, while other courts may require oral argument without the ability to waive it. Courts may also have the discretion to decide a case without presentation of oral argument, rendering their judgment entirely based on the arguments set forth in the parties&#x27; briefs. David Tatel, judge in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has referred to a &quot;long-established rule&quot; that contentions made for the first time at oral argument are &quot;rarely considered&quot;.

<text>Pietro Giacomo Porcelli (30 January 1872 – 28 June 1943) was an Italian-born sculptor responsible for many statues in Western Australia, including the Explorers&#x27; Monument, and those of C. Y. O&#x27;Connor and Alexander Forrest.

==Biography==
Born in Bisceglie in the province of Bari, he moved to Sydney with his fisherman father at the age of 8. After initial training at the New South Wales Academy of Art, he furthered his study of sculpture and drawing in Naples, before returning to Fremantle with his father in 1898. Later that year, he completed his first commission – a bust of Sir John Forrest that now stands in the main entrance hall of Parliament House in Perth. His 1902 statue of Alexander Forrest was the first such statue of a prominent public figure to be completed in Perth. He also created the imposing figure which stood atop the seven-storey AMP Chambers at the corner of St George&#x27;s Tce and William St, which was completed in 1915, but demolished in 1972.

Porcelli also completed war memorials in Kalgoorlie, Boulder, Victoria Park, West Leederville and Moora, and numerous headstones in Karrakatta and Fremantle Cemeteries, including that of Sir John Forrest in 1918.

After a period of work in Melbourne in the 1920s, he returned to Perth in 1939, where he died in 1943. He is buried in Karrakatta Cemetery.

<text>The Jack Dempsey (Rocio octofasciata) is a species of cichlid fish that is native to freshwater habitats from southern Mexico to Honduras, but also introduced elsewhere. Its common name refers to its aggressive nature and strong facial features, likened to that of the famous 1920s boxer Jack Dempsey.

==Distribution==
The fish is native to freshwater habitats from southern Mexico to Honduras, where it is found in slow-moving waters, such as swampy areas with warm, murky water, weedy, mud- and sand-bottomed canals, drainage ditches, and rivers. It is also established as an introduced species in Australia, the United States and Thailand (presumably as an aquarium escapee) These are locally known as the Mexican Blue Frontosa.

==Ecology==
The Jack Dempsey natively lives in a tropical climate and prefers water with a pH of 6–7, a water hardness of 9–20 dGH, and a temperature range of . Males can reach up to 10 inches (25 cm) in length. It is carnivorous, eating worms, crustaceans, insects and other fish. In the wild they are found in warm murky water including mangroves and the lower reaches of rivers and streams.

===Impacts===
The features that make cichlids popular pets are also those that contribute to their invasive potential: ‘they are hardy, adaptable and breed prolifically’.

Cichlids have the potential to dominate native fish populations through their aggressive behaviour and competition for food and space. They eat almost anything smaller than themselves, including fish, invertebrates and frogs . As relatively large and aggressive carnivores they could have devastating impacts on native fish populations if they spread to other waterways, such as the nearby Clarence River.

Cichlids also have the potential to introduce disease into wild fish populations. Many pathogens and parasites have been recorded in imported ornamental fish in quarantine and post-quarantine in Australia.

Social and economic impacts include the costs of control, impacts on recreationally valued fish, including the spread of disease.

==Reproduction==
Jack Dempseys lay their eggs on a flat hard surface within their territory, such as rocks, logs, or the glass bottom of an aquarium. Like most cichlids, they show substantial parental care: both parents help incubate the eggs and guard the fry when they hatch. Jack Dempseys are known to be attentive parents, pre-chewing food to feed to their offspring. However, it is not uncommon for them to eat their fry when the breeding pair are overly disturbed or something in their environment is wrong.

Females lay approximately 500–800 eggs per clutch. The eggs are protected by both parents, which are extremely aggressive towards other fish during the spawning season.

==Morphology==
The coloration changes as the fish matures from a light gray or tan with faint turquoise flecks to a dark purple-gray with very bright, iridescent blue, green, and gold flecks. Their colors change under stress. The dorsal and anal fins of mature males have long, pointed tips. Females lack these exaggerated tips. During breeding both genders considerably darken in color, appearing almost black with little to no metallic coloration.

Different variations of color are also available on the aquarium market. Color variants include Gold, Electric Blue, and pink (a fish that displays both gold &amp; blue traits).

Jack Dempsey cichlids are a medium-sized fish which can be distinguished from other cichlids by the presence of two grey-black bars on the top of their head which extend forward between their eyes. Their background colour is dark blue and they have a series of white to iridescent blue spots on their fins, head and body, and a series of dark bars along their sides.

==In the aquarium==
The fish is a popular aquarium fish, due to its striking appearance and personable mannerisms. It, like most cichlids, is considered &quot;aggressive&quot;, but can get along in a well-populated tank, tending to be more territorial if kept with only a few other fish, therefore allowed to easily establish and defend a &quot;territory&quot; in the tank. Jack Dempsey cichlids can often appear shy, hiding away in cave work. It is recommended that the Jack Dempsey cichlid is provided with plenty of places to hide. They will often claim a cave first and be very aggressive to other tank mates that swim near its home. 
There is also a blue variant of this fish which commonly known as the blue Jack Dempsey or electric blue Jack Dempsey. This is a natural genetic mutation. The blue counterpart is less aggressive, smaller in size and more delicate.

==In Australia==
Jack Dempsey cichlids were discovered in a flooded quarry in New South Wales (NSW) Australia in 2004 in the Angourie area, near Yamba on the NSW north coast. Although efforts were made to eradicate them in 2004 and 2005, the fish remain. Jack Dempsey cichlids are one of about 30 aquarium fish species that have become established in Australian waterways, and have been shown to have a significant impact on Australian aquatic ecosystems. They highlight the importance of preventing the importation of invasive fish species because they are extremely difficult or impossible to eradicate once they become established in the wild.

In Australia, they are a popular aquarium fish typically sold to tropical freshwater tanks, although their aggressive nature means they ‘are not suitable for community tanks’. Because Jack Dempsey cichlids are popular pets there is little doubt that this population established from illegally released aquarium fish. They can live more than 10 years and can reach 25 cm in length. They prefer temperatures of between 22 and 30oC, but can survive in temperatures as low as 8–10oC.

===Eradication attempts===
When Jack Dempseys were first discovered in the Green Pool, Angourie the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) considered them to be a good target for eradication because the pool was relatively small, confined, and contained few native fish. Three eradication attempts were carried out between September 2004 and June 2005 using explosives. Large Australian bass were then released into the pool to prey on any remaining larvae or juveniles that were not killed by the blasts.

Follow up monitoring by the NSW DPI has found Jack Dempsey cichlids remain in the pool. It is possible that some fish survived eradication attempts or that they were deliberately re-introduced. According to the NSW DPI, no further eradication work is planned.

===Biosecurity===
There are growing concerns about the ongoing importation of aquarium fish such as Jack Dempsey cichlids into Australia. More than two-thirds of naturalised non-native fish in Australia are thought to have come from the aquarium trade, and non-native fish species are ‘implicated in the decline of 42 per cent of Australian native fish and several frog species’. On the basis of significant potential impacts on biodiversity, the Australian Government&#x27;s Threatened Species Scientific Committee determined that the process of introducing fish outside their natural geographic distribution met the criteria for listing as a key threatening process (KTP). However, the process has not yet been listed as a KTP, and several hundred aquarium fish species continue to be permitted for import into Australia, including more than 250 freshwater species. In 2004–05 alone, 15 million fish were imported.

According to experts, a large part of the problem stems from inadequate import assessments and controls. For example, an extensive review of introduced aquarium fish in Australia concluded that assessments are ‘based on information obtained overseas and are likely to be of limited value in predicting the likelihood of environmental impacts in Australian waters’. In assessing the case for revised import controls – particularly in the context of introduced diseases, scientists recommended that ‘the number of species traded and the number of sources permitted need to be dramatically reduced to facilitate hazard identification, risk assessment and import quarantine controls.’

<doc id="425202" wikidata="Q4967012" url="?curid=425202" title="Brief (law)">
<text>A brief (Old French from Latin &quot;brevis&quot;, short) is a written legal document used in various legal adversarial systems that is presented to a court arguing why one party to a particular case should prevail. 

In England and Wales (and other Commonwealth countries, e.g., Australia) the phrase refers to the papers given to a barrister when they are instructed.

==Language==
:Pre-trial briefs are exchanged between parties at a date set during the pre-trial conference to argue matters under consideration before trial.
:Trial briefs are presented at trial to resolve a disputed point of evidence.
:Legal briefs are used as part of arguing a pre-trial motion in a case or proceeding.
:: Merit briefs (or briefs on the merits) are briefs on the inherent rights and wrongs of a case, absent any emotional or technical biases
:: Amicus briefs are briefs filed by persons not directly party to the case. These are often groups that have a direct interest in the outcome.
: Appellate briefs are briefs that occur at the appeal stage.
:Memorandum of law may be another word for brief, although that term may also be used to describe an internal document in a law firm in which an attorney attempts to analyze a client&#x27;s legal position without arguing for a specific interpretation of the law.
:IRAC case briefs are usually a one-page review done by a paralegal or attorney, ultimately used by the attorney to find previously decided cases by an appellate court, in state or federal jurisdiction, which show how the courts have ruled on earlier similar cases in court.

==Function==
The brief or memorandum establishes the legal argument for the party, explaining why the reviewing court should affirm or reverse the lower court&#x27;s judgment based on legal precedent and citations to the controlling cases or statutory law.
To achieve these ends, the brief must appeal to the accepted forces such as statutory law or precedent, but may also include policy arguments and social statistics when appropriate. For example, if the law is vague or broad enough to allow the appellate judge some discretion in his decision making, an exploration of the consequences of the possible decision outside of legal formalism may provide guidance. Such arguments may also support a legal argument when the purpose of the law at issue may be clear, but the particular application of that law in service of that purpose is in dispute.

==Procedure==
The party filing the appeal – called the petitioner or appellant, who is attempting to convince the appellate court to overturn the lower court decision – is responsible for submitting his brief first. The responding party – the respondent or appellee, who is satisfied with the lower decision – then files a reply brief within a specified time. Depending on the local rules of procedure, the court may allow or even require the parties to then file additional replies to the opposing party&#x27;s briefs, multiplying the back-and-forth responses of the parties. Depending on local rules, the court may then decide the case purely based on the submitted briefs or may hear oral argument by the parties.

==England==
Upon a barrister devolves the duty of taking charge of a case when it comes into court, but all the preliminary work, such as the drawing up of the case, serving papers, marshalling evidence, etc., is performed by a solicitor. The delivery of a brief to counsel gives him authority to act for his client in all matters which the litigation involves.

The brief was probably so called from its first being only a copy of the original writ.

===Contents===
A brief contains a concise summary for the information of counsel of the case which the barrister has to plead, with all material facts in chronological order, and frequently such observations thereon as the solicitor may think fit to make, the names of witnesses, with the &quot;proofs,&quot; that is, the nature of the evidence which each witness is ready to give, if called upon. The brief may also contain suggestions for the use of counsel when cross-examining witnesses called by the other side. Accompanying the brief may be copies of the pleadings, and of all documents material to the case. The brief is always endorsed with the title of the court in which the action is to be tried, with the title of the action, and the names of the counsel and of the solicitor who delivers the brief. Counsel&#x27;s fee is also marked. The result of the action is noted on the brief by counsel, or if the action is compromised, the terms of the compromise are endorsed on each brief and signed by the leading counsel on the opposite side.

===Brief bag===

The &quot;brief-bag&quot;, in which counsel&#x27;s papers are carried to and from court, now forms an integral part of a barrister&#x27;s outfit, although today it is used primarily to carry counsel&#x27;s robes. In the early part of the 19th century the possession of a brief-bag was strictly confined to those who had received one from a king&#x27;s counsel (silk). King&#x27;s Counsel were then few in number, were considered officers of the court, and had a salary of £40 a year, with a supply of paper, pens and purple bags. These bags they distributed among rising juniors of their acquaintance, whose bundles of briefs were getting inconveniently large to be carried in their hands. These perquisites were abolished in 1830.

Brief-bags are now either blue or red. Blue bags are those with which barristers provide themselves when first called, and, in some jurisdictions, it is a breach of etiquette to let this bag be visible in court. The only brief-bag allowed to be placed on the desks is the red bag, which by English legal etiquette is given by a leading counsel to a junior as a reward for excellence in some important case. This is still viewed as one of the great traditions of the bar. The red bag is embroidered with the junior barrister&#x27;s initials and a handwritten note of thanks is usually placed inside the bag. In many jurisdictions, the receipt of a red bag from a silk is seen as a rite of passage for a junior barrister.

The use of such special bags eventually led to the briefcase.

=== Ecclesiastical ===
In English ecclesiastical law a brief meant letters patent issued out of chancery to churchwardens or other officers for the collection of money for church purposes. Such briefs were regulated by a statute of 1704, but are now obsolete, though they are still to be found named in one of the rubrics in the Communion service of the Book of Common Prayer.

==United States==
In the United States, the word differs in meaning from its English counterpart because attorneys in the United States exercise all the functions distributed in England between barristers and solicitors. A lawyer sometimes prepares for his own use what is called a &quot;trial brief&quot; for use at the trial. This corresponds in all essential particulars with the &quot;brief&quot; prepared by the solicitor in England for the use of counsel.

But the more distinctive use of the term in America is in the case of the brief &quot;in error or appeal,&quot; before an appellate court. This is a written or printed document, varying according to circumstances, but embodying the argument on the question affected. Most of the appellate courts require the filing of printed briefs for the use of the court and opposing counsel at a time designated for each side before hearing. In the rules of the United States Supreme Court and circuit courts of appeals the brief is required to contain a concise statement of the case, a specification of errors relied on, including the substance of evidence, the admission or rejection of which is to be reviewed, or any extract from a charge excepted to, and an argument exhibiting clearly the points of law or fact to be discussed. This form of brief, it may be added, is also adopted for use at the trial in certain states of the Union which require printed briefs to be delivered to the court.

===Contents===
In American courts, the brief typically has the following parts: a table of contents; a table of authorities listing the cases, statutes, and regulations that are cited; a presentation of the issues under review by the court, usually in only one sentence if possible; a statement of the case that presents the relevant facts and the previous history of the case in the lower courts; a summary of the legal standard of review that the appellate court should use in evaluating the decision of the lower court; a summary of the party&#x27;s argument; and the full discussion of the legal and/or policy arguments explaining why the party believes it should win the case, which will be the most lengthy portion of the brief. The brief may also be accompanied by an appendix that includes copies of the lower court opinions and other documents or court opinions cited in the brief. The particular required format of briefs is a matter of local court procedural rules.

==Elsewhere==
In Scotland a brief is called a memorial and in Canada it is called a factum. In Australia the tradition regarding briefs is almost identical to England, except that the use of brief bags is relatively uncommon.
In Dutch and German, the word &quot;brief&quot; refers to a regular letter.

==Professional vs. student briefs==
In North American law schools, students usually study historical cases by &quot;briefing&quot; them. Law school briefs are shorter than court briefs but follow a similar structure: presentation of issue, presentation of facts, presentation of legal and policy arguments and presentation of outcome. In the United States, the practice of briefing cases for study began at Harvard Law School in the fall of 1870 with the introduction of the case method of teaching by Professor Christopher Columbus Langdell. Case briefing is a widely accepted pedagogical method among law professors today.

==IRAC Case Briefing==
IRAC is an Abbreviation of Issue, Rule, Analysis (or some say Application), Conclusion.
When a potential client has an interview with an attorney and tells of the legal problem, the attorney, or office paralegal, will review prior case law to find out if the client does indeed have a problem that has legal remedy.

The formation of each case brief follows the same pattern: Facts, Issue, Rule, Analysis, Impact. A case brief may also include a dissent or concurrence if there is either in the particular case. The facts should include the important information from the case, and should also include the procedural history before it makes it to the supreme court. The issue statement should always be in the form of a question that will be answered in the rule section.

Some schools prefer students to list the Facts, Issue, Holding, and Reasoning.

<doc id="425207" wikidata="Q7867971" url="?curid=425207" title="USS Cabot (1775)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Cabot&quot; of the United States was a 14-gun brig, one of the first ships of the Continental Navy, and the first to be captured in the American Revolutionary War in the Battle off Yarmouth (1777).

On 13 October 1775, acting on intelligence received concerning the dispatch of supply vessels from Britain, the Continental Congress authorized the acquisition of two ships and the appointment of a three man Naval Committee to oversee their acquisition and fitting out. At that time, one vessel was specified as being of 10 guns while the other was not of a specified size. On 30 October 1775, The issue was again revisited by Congress and the second vessel was specified as being of 14 guns while two more, larger vessels were authorized. Even though the first vessel was specified as 10 guns, the footnotes in for the entry on the 30th from the compilation known as &quot;Naval Documents of the American Revolution&quot; specifies the first authorization as being the Cabot while the second is the Andrew Doria (1775 brig). The newly authorized ships are identified as the USS Columbus (1774) and the USS Alfred (1774).

The brig Cabot was purchased in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during November 1775, outfitted there by Wharton and Humphreys, and placed under the command of Captain J. B. Hopkins.

Sailing with Commodore Esek Hopkins&#x27; fleet, &quot;Cabot&quot; joined in the expedition against the Bahamas in March 1776, taking part in the amphibious operations against New Providence on 3 March. By this bold stroke, men of the fleet seized large quantities of desperately needed military supplies which they carried back to the Continental Army. Upon the return of the fleet north, &quot;Cabot&quot; was first to fire in the engagement with HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; on 6 April. The next month, she made a short cruise off the New England coast, during which she took her first prize. In September and October, again sailing in New England waters, she seized six more prizes.

Under the command of Captain Joseph Olney, &quot;Cabot&quot; stood out of Boston weeks before on 28 March 1777 the vessel (140 men) encountered HMS &quot;Milford&quot; (32), under the command of Captain John Burr, in the Battle off Yarmouth (1777). The vastly more powerful British ship chased &quot;Cabot&quot; and forced her ashore near the mouth of the Chebogue, Nova Scotia. While &quot;Cabot&#x27;s&quot; captain and crew escaped into the woods unharmed, the British were later able to get the brig off, and refitted her for service in the Royal Navy.

She stands out as the first American armed vessel to engage an enemy. According to Brigadier General Edwin H. Simmons&#x27; research, the act was initiated by a Continental Marine in the tops of the Cabot throwing a hand grenade at the feet of the British officer, who at that point was still waiting for a reply from the American vessel.

<doc id="425212" wikidata="Q1347401" url="?curid=425212" title="William Mulholland">
<text>William Mulholland (September 11, 1855 – July 22, 1935) was an Irish American self-taught civil engineer who was responsible for building the infrastructure to provide a water supply that allowed Los Angeles to grow into the largest city in California. As the head of a predecessor to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, Mulholland designed and supervised the building of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, a system to move water from Owens Valley to the San Fernando Valley. The creation and operation of the aqueduct led to the disputes known as the California Water Wars. In March 1928, Mulholland&#x27;s career came to an end when the St. Francis Dam failed just over 12 hours after his assistant and he gave it a safety inspection.

==Early life==
William Mulholland was born in Belfast, Ireland, part of the United Kingdom. His parents Hugh and Ellen Mulholland were Dubliners and they returned to the city a few years after William&#x27;s birth. His younger brother, Hugh Jr., was born in 1856. At the time of Mulholland&#x27;s birth, his father was working as a guard for the Royal Mail. In 1862, when William was seven years old, his mother died. Three years later, his father remarried. William was educated at O&#x27;Connell School by the Christian Brothers in Dublin. After having been beaten by his father for receiving bad marks in school, Mulholland ran off to sea.

At 15, Mulholland was a member of the British Merchant Navy. He spent the next four years as a seaman on &quot;Gleniffer&quot;, making at least 19 Atlantic crossings to ports in North America and the Caribbean. In 1874, he disembarked in New York City and headed west to Michigan, where he worked a summer on a Great Lakes freighter and the winter in a lumber camp.

After nearly losing a leg in a logging accident, he moved to Ohio, where he worked as a handyman. Mulholland reconnected with his brother Hugh, and in December 1876, they stowed away on a ship in New York bound for California. They were discovered in Panama, and were forced to leave the ship. They then walked over 47 miles through jungle to Balboa. Mulholland arrived in Los Angeles in 1877.

==Initial career in Los Angeles==
After arriving in Los Angeles, which at the time had a population of about 9,000, Mulholland quickly decided to return to life at sea, as work was hard to find. On his way to the port at San Pedro to find a ship, he accepted a job digging a well. After a brief stint in Arizona, where he prospected for gold and worked on the Colorado River, he obtained a job from Frederick Eaton as Deputy Zanjero (water distributor) with the newly formed Los Angeles City Water Company (LACWC). In Alta California during the Spanish and Mexican administrations, water was delivered to Pueblo de Los Angeles in a large, open ditch, the Zanja Madre. The man who tended the ditch was known as a &quot;zanjero&quot;.

In 1880, Mulholland oversaw the laying of the first iron water pipeline in Los Angeles. Mulholland left the employment of the LACWC briefly in 1884, but returned in mid-December. He left again in 1885 and worked for the Sespe Land and Water Company. As part of his compensation, he was granted 20 acres on Sespe Creek. In 1886, he returned to the LACWC, and in October became a naturalized American citizen. At the end of the year, he was made the superintendent of the LACWC. In 1898, the Los Angeles city government decided not to renew the contract with the LACWC.

Four years later, the Los Angeles Water Department was established with Mulholland as its superintendent. In 1911, the department was renamed the Bureau of Water Works and Supply, with Mulholland named as its chief engineer. In 1937, two years after Mulholland&#x27;s death, the Bureau of Water Works and Supply merged with the Bureau of Power and Light to form the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power; the agency continues to control, supply, and maintain all the city&#x27;s domestic services.

==Los Angeles Aqueduct==
Mulholland envisioned Los Angeles growing much larger. The limiting factor to its growth was its water supply, because it has a semiarid climate with unreliable rainfall. &quot;If you don&#x27;t get the water, you won&#x27;t need it,&quot; Mulholland famously remarked.

Mulholland shared the vision of a much larger Los Angeles with Frederick Eaton, the mayor of Los Angeles from 1898 through 1900. They had worked together in the private Los Angeles Water Company in the 1880s. In 1886, Eaton became city engineer and Mulholland became superintendent of the water company. When Eaton was elected mayor of Los Angeles, he was instrumental in converting the water company to city control in 1902.

When the company became the Los Angeles Water Department, Mulholland continued to be superintendent, due to his vast knowledge of the water system. Expansion rapidly followed as Mulholland&#x27;s public-works program began to irrigate large areas of previously arid land. Within a decade, the city&#x27;s population had doubled from just 50,000 in 1890 to more than 100,000 in 1900. Ten years later it had tripled to almost 320,000.

To create this expansion, Eaton and Mulholland realized that the large amount of runoff from the Sierra Nevada in Owens Valley could be delivered to Los Angeles through a gravity-fed aqueduct.

From 1902 to 1905, Eaton, Mulholland, and others engaged in underhanded methods to ensure that Los Angeles would gain the water rights in the Owens Valley, blocking the Bureau of Reclamation from building water infrastructure for the residents in Owens Valley. While Eaton engaged in most of the political maneuverings and chicanery, Mulholland misled Los Angeles public opinion by dramatically understating the amount of water then available for Los Angeles&#x27; growth. Mulholland also misled residents of the Owens Valley; he indicated that Los Angeles would only use unused flows in the Owens Valley, while planning on using the full water rights to fill the aquifer of the San Fernando Valley.

In 1906, the Los Angeles Board of Water Commissioners appointed Mulholland the chief engineer of the Bureau of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. From 1907 to 1913, Mulholland directed the building of the aqueduct. The Los Angeles Aqueduct, inaugurated in November 1913, required 3900 workers at its peak and involved the digging of 164 tunnels. Construction began in 1908. The complexity of the project has been compared to the building of the Panama Canal. Water from the Owens River reached a reservoir in the San Fernando Valley on November 5, 1913. At a ceremony that day, Mulholland spoke his famous words about this engineering feat: &quot;There it is. Take it.&quot;

The aqueduct carries water from the Owens Valley in the Eastern Sierra to irrigate and store water in the San Fernando Valley. When the aqueduct was built, the San Fernando Valley was not part of the city. From a hydrological point of view, the San Fernando Valley was ideal; its aquifer could serve as free water storage without evaporation. One obstacle to the irrigation was the Los Angeles City Charter, which prohibited the sale, lease, or other use of the city&#x27;s water without a two-thirds approval by the voters. This charter limitation was avoided through the annexation of a large portion of the San Fernando Valley to the city.

Mulholland realised that the annexation would raise the debt limit of Los Angeles, which allowed the financing of the aqueduct. By 1915, the initial annexations were completed, and by 1926, the land area of Los Angeles had doubled, making it the largest city in the United States by area. Areas that opted to join the municipal water network were Owensmouth (Canoga Park) (1917), Laurel Canyon (1923), Lankershim (1923), Sunland (1926), La Tuna Canyon (1926), and the incorporated city of Tujunga (1932). The historical relationship between water and the rapid urbanization and growth of Los Angeles is the basis for the fictional plot of the 1974 film &quot;Chinatown&quot;.

The water from Mulholland&#x27;s aqueduct also shifted farming from wheat to irrigated crops such as corn, beans, squash, and cotton; orchards of apricots, persimmons, and walnuts; and major citrus groves of oranges and lemons. These continued within the city environs until the next increment of development converted land use into suburbanization. A few enclaves remain, such as the groves at the Orcutt Ranch Park and CSUN campus.

==Professional recognition==

Mulholland, who was self-taught, became the first American civil engineer to use hydraulic sluicing to build a dam while constructing the Silver Lake Reservoir in 1906. This new method attracted nationwide attention of engineers and dam builders. Government engineers adopted the method when building Gatun Dam, on which Mulholland was a consultant, in the Panama Canal Zone.

In 1914, the University of California, Berkeley, awarded Mulholland an honorary doctoral degree. The inscription on the diploma read, &quot;Percussit saxa et duxit flumina ad terram sitientum&quot; (He broke the rocks and brought the river to the thirsty land). Mulholland&#x27;s public profile continued to grow. His offices were, at one point, on the top floor of Sid Grauman&#x27;s Million Dollar Theater. He was even a favorite to become mayor of Los Angeles. When asked if he was considering running for office, he replied, &quot;I&#x27;d rather give birth to a porcupine backward&quot;.

==Calaveras Dam==
In May 1913, the Spring Valley Water Company (SVWC), which owned the water supply of San Francisco, authorized an executive committee to approve plans and direct construction of the original dam to create Calaveras Reservoir; the committee was also authorized to hire Mulholland as a consultant. That October, with construction of the dam underway, San Francisco&#x27;s city engineer, Michael O&#x27;Shaughnessy, wrote negatively of Mulholland in a letter to John R. Freeman, an engineer who had assisted the city in its pursuit of permission to construct the Hetch Hetchy reservoir and water system in Yosemite National Park. O&#x27;Shaughnessy expressed the view that Mulholland and F. C. Hermann, chief engineer for the SVWC, were &quot;so intensely conceited that they imagine all they might do should be immune from criticism.&quot;

Indicating construction details or practices that he thought incorrect, O&#x27;Shaughnessy wrote of what was, in his view, sloppiness and recklessness at the Calaveras dam site; he said, &quot;another feature which made objectionable impressions&quot; on him was &quot;the flippant manner in which the young college boys in charge of the work and Mulholland, with his swollen ideas of accomplishment, have undertaken this very serious engineering project.&quot;

On March 24, 1918, the dam suffered a partial collapse of the upstream slope. At the time, the water in the reservoir was 55 feet deep; no water was released.

==Owens Valley conflict==
After the Los Angeles Aqueduct was completed, the San Fernando investors demanded so much water from the Owens Valley that it started to transform from &quot;the Switzerland of California&quot; into a desert. Mulholland was blocked from obtaining additional water from the Colorado River, so decided to take all available water from the Owens Valley. By exploiting personal bitterness of some of the Owens Valley farmers, Los Angeles managed to acquire some key water rights. After these water rights were secured, inflows to Owens Lake were heavily diverted, which caused the lake to dry up by 1924.

By 1924, farmers and ranchers rebelled. A series of provocations by Mulholland was, in turn, followed by corresponding threats from local farmers, and the destruction of Los Angeles property. Finally, a group of armed ranchers seized the Alabama Gates and dynamited the aqueduct at Jawbone Canyon, letting water return to the Owens River.
Additional acts of violence against the aqueduct continued through the year, culminating in a major showdown when opponents seized a key part of the aqueduct, and for four days, completely shut off the water to Los Angeles. The state and local authorities declined to take any action, and the press portrayed the Owens Valley farmers and ranchers as underdogs. Eventually, Mulholland and the city administration were forced to negotiate. Mulholland was quoted as saying, in anger, he &quot;half-regretted the demise of so many of the valley&#x27;s orchard trees, because now there were no longer enough trees to hang all the troublemakers who live there&quot;.

In 1927, when the conflict over the water was at its height, the Inyo County Bank collapsed, due to embezzlement. The economy of Owens Valley collapsed, and the attacks ceased. The city of Los Angeles sponsored a series of repair and maintenance programs for aqueduct facilities, that stimulated some local employment and the Los Angeles water employees were paid a month in advance to bring some relief.

==St. Francis Dam collapse==

Mulholland&#x27;s career effectively ended on March 12, 1928, when the St. Francis Dam failed 12 hours after his assistant, assistant chief engineer and general manager Harvey Van Norman and he had personally inspected the site. Within seconds after the collapse, only what had been a large section of the central part of the dam remained standing and the reservoir&#x27;s 12.4 billion gallons (47 million m3) of water began moving down San Francisquito Canyon in a torrent at 18 miles per hour (29 km/h). In the canyon, it demolished the heavy concrete Powerhouse Number Two (a hydroelectric power plant) and took the lives of 64 of the 67 workmen and their families living there.

The waters traveled south and emptied into the Santa Clara riverbed, flooding parts of present-day Valencia and Newhall. Following the riverbed, the water continued west, flooding the towns of Castaic Junction, Piru, Fillmore, Bardsdale and Santa Paula in Ventura County. It was almost two miles (3 km) wide, and still traveling at 5 miles (8 km) per hour when it reached the ocean at 5:30 am; emptying its victims and debris into the Pacific Ocean near Montalvo, 54 miles (87 km) from the reservoir and dam site. Many of the bodies that had been washed out to sea were recovered from the sea, some as far south as the Mexican border; others were never found.

Santa Paula received some of the worst damage, especially the lowland areas nearer the riverbed. Here, in many areas, only foundations or rubble marked where many homes had been. Rescue efforts were hampered and walking was made hazardous by a thick layer of mud that covered the area.

Recovery crews worked for days to dig out bodies and clear away the mud from the flood&#x27;s path. The final death toll is estimated to be at least 431, of whom at least 108 were minors.

Mulholland took full responsibility for what has been called the worst US man-made disaster of the 20th century and retired in November 1928. During the Los Angeles coroner&#x27;s inquest, Mulholland said, &quot;this inquest is very painful for me to have to attend, but it is the occasion of what is painful. The only ones I envy about this whole thing are the ones who are dead.&quot; In later testimony, after responding to a question, he added, &quot;Whether it is good or bad, don&#x27;t blame anyone else, you just fasten it on me. If there was an error in human judgment, I was the human, I won&#x27;t try to fasten it on anyone else.&quot;

The inquest jury concluded that responsibility for the disaster lay in an error in engineering judgment about the suitability of the area&#x27;s geology as a stable foundation for the dam, and in errors in public policy. They recommended that Mulholland not be held criminally responsible, as they stated in their verdict, &quot;We, the Jury, find no evidence of act of criminal act or intent on the part of the Board of Water Works and Supply of the City of Los Angeles, or any engineer or employee in the construction or operation of the St. Francis Dam...&quot;

Nonetheless, his critics pointed out that another dam on which Mulholland had acted as a consultant collapsed, and the city abandoned a dam project in San Gabriel before completion. Mulholland had increased the height of the dam by after construction had started, without specifying a corresponding increase in the width of the base.

==Later life and death==
Mulholland spent the rest of his life in relative seclusion, devastated by the tragedy. In retirement, he began writing an autobiography, but never completed it. Shortly before his death, he was consulted on the Hoover Dam and Colorado River Aqueduct projects. He died in 1935 from a stroke, and is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==Legacy==
In his book &quot;Water and Power&quot;, historian William L. Kahrl summed up Mulholland&#x27;s public legacy to the principle of public water development in writing:

The harshest judgement of Mulholland&#x27;s actions lay in the damage he had done to the principle of public water development. More than any other individual, William Mulholland, through the building of the aqueduct and the formation of the Metropolitan Water District, established the principle of public ownership of water indelibly on California&#x27;s history. But the furor that followed upon the mistakes made in the last seven years of his public service discredited the man and thereby gave aid to the enemies of the ideal he had labored all his life to establish.

In Los Angeles, Mulholland Dam in the Hollywood Hills, Mulholland Drive, Mulholland Highway and Mullholland Middle School are named for Mulholland.

==In popular culture==
* Singer/songwriter Frank Black recorded two songs about the life and works of William Mulholland: &quot;Ole Mulholland&quot;, from &quot;Teenager of the Year&quot; (1994) and &quot;St. Francis Dam Disaster&quot;, from &quot;Dog in the Sand&quot; (2001).
* William Mullholland and the California Water Wars are the subject of the BBC Northern Ireland television documentary &quot;Patrick Kielty&#x27;s Mulholland Drive&quot;. The program was broadcast in the UK in February 2016 and presented by Irish comedian and television personality Patrick Kielty.
*In the 1974 film &quot;Chinatown&quot;, the character of Hollis Mulwray is based loosely on Mulholland.
*Mulholland was portrayed by Jack Black in an episode of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Drunk History&quot; that parodied his legacy.

<doc id="425220" wikidata="Q258846" url="?curid=425220" title="Rickie Lee Jones">
<text>Rickie Lee Jones (born November 8, 1954) is an American singer, musician, and songwriter. Over the course of a career that spans five decades and 15 studio albums, she has recorded in various musical styles including rock, R&amp;B, pop, soul, and jazz. A two-time Grammy Award winner (from eight nominations), Jones was listed at No. 30 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Women in Rock &amp; Roll in 1999. AllMusic stated: &quot;Few singer/songwriters are as individual and eclectic as Rickie Lee Jones, a vocalist with an expressive and smoky instrument, and a composer who can weave jazz, folk, and R&amp;B into songs with a distinct pop sensibility.&quot;

She released her self-titled debut album in 1979, to critical and commercial success. It peaked at No. 3 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and spawned the hit single &quot;Chuck E.&#x27;s in Love&quot;, which peaked at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album went platinum later that year, and earned Jones four Grammy Award nominations in 1980, including Best New Artist, which she won. Her second album, &quot;Pirates&quot;, followed in 1981 to further critical and commercial success; it peaked at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, went gold, and ranked No. 49 on NPR&#x27;s list of the 150 Greatest Albums Made by Women in 2017.

Her third album, &quot;The Magazine&quot;, appeared in 1984 before Jones took a brief hiatus from recording. Her fourth album, &quot;Flying Cowboys&quot;, was released in 1989 and later went gold. Jones won her second Grammy Award in 1990 for &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot;, a duet with Dr. John, this time in the category of Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Duo or Group. Jones&#x27; seventh Grammy Award nomination followed in 2001 in the category of Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album for her album &quot;It&#x27;s Like This&quot; (2000). In 2021, Jones released her memoir &quot;Last Chance Texaco: Chronicles of an American Troubadour&quot;. Her 15th studio album, &quot;Pieces of Treasure&quot;, was released in 2023 and earned Jones her eighth Grammy Award nomination, for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album.

==Early life==
Jones was born the third of four children to Richard and Bettye Jones, on the north side of Chicago, Illinois, on November 8, 1954. She was named after her father, who was a singer, songwriter, painter, and trumpet player. Her mother, Bettye, was raised in orphanages around Mansfield, Ohio. She has a brother, Daniel, and two sisters, Janet Adele and Pamela Jo. Her paternal grandfather, Frank &quot;Peg Leg&quot; Jones, and her grandmother, Myrtle Lee, were vaudevillians based in Chicago. A singer, dancer, and comedian, Peg Leg Jones&#x27;s routine consisted of singing and accompanying himself on ukulele, soft shoe dance, acrobatics, and comedy.

Jones lived in Phoenix, Arizona, from age 4 to 14.

==Career==
===Early years: 1975–1982===
At the age of 21, Jones began singing traditional jazz and original compositions in bars and coffee houses in Venice, California. There she met Alfred Johnson, a piano player and songwriter, with whom she wrote &quot;Weasel and the White Boys Cool&quot;, and &quot;Company&quot;, which would later appear on Jones&#x27;s debut album. In 1977, Jones met Tom Waits at The Troubadour. They dated for about two years, before splitting in 1979.

&quot;Rickie Lee Jones&quot; was released in March 1979 and became a critical and commercial hit, buoyed by the success of the jazz-flavored single &quot;Chuck E.&#x27;s in Love&quot;, which hit  4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and featured an accompanying music video. The song was occasioned by her friend, Chuck E. Weiss, telephoning her and Tom Waits, all three of them close friends at the time, in the fall of 1977 to tell them that he had fallen in love. The album, which included guest appearances by Dr. John, Randy Newman, and Michael McDonald, reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, went Platinum, and produced another Top 40 hit with &quot;Young Blood&quot; (No. 40) in late 1979.

Her appearance – as an unknown (one month after her debut record had been released) – on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on April 7, 1979, sparked an overnight sensation. She performed &quot;Chuck E.&#x27;s in Love&quot; and &quot;Coolsville&quot;. Jones was covered by &quot;Time&quot; magazine on her very first professional show, in Boston, and they dubbed her &quot;The Duchess of Coolsville&quot;. Touring after the album&#x27;s release, she played Carnegie Hall on July 22, 1979. Members of her group included native New York guitarist Buzz Feiten, who was featured on the album and would appear in her recorded works for over a decade. Following her first-ever performances in the spring/summer of 1979, Jones appeared on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. Photographed by Annie Leibovitz, the cover image showed Jones posing in a crouched stance, wearing a black bra and a white beret.

Jones secured four nominations at the 22nd Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female for &quot;Chuck E.&#x27;s in Love&quot;; Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female for &quot;The Last Chance Texaco&quot;; and Best New Artist, which she won. The album also earned a nomination for Best Engineered Recording - Non-Classical, credited to Tom Knox.

In 1980, Francis Ford Coppola asked Jones to collaborate with Waits on his upcoming film &quot;One from the Heart&quot;, but she balked, citing their recent breakup in late 1979. Coppola argued that the duet would be perfect for the film, since the two main characters in the film are separated, and he asked her to reconsider. Waits ultimately sang with country pop star Crystal Gayle.

In 1981, Jones released her second album, &quot;Pirates&quot;, which received high marks from critics and was a commercial success. The album reached No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and soon achieved Gold certification. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remained a fervent supporter of Jones, with a second cover feature in 1981; the magazine also included a glowing five-star review of &quot;Pirates&quot;. The single &quot;A Lucky Guy&quot; became the only &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit from the album, peaking at No. 64, but &quot;Pirates (So Long Lonely Avenue)&quot; and &quot;Woody and Dutch on the Slow Train to Peking&quot; became minor Top 40 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart.

Jones left New York for San Francisco where she befriended Robin Williams. In Los Angeles, she recorded the EP &quot;Girl at Her Volcano&quot;, producing the record herself and drawing the cover art. It was released as a 10&quot; record in 1983, featuring a mix of live and studio cover versions of jazz and pop standards, as well as one Jones original, &quot;Hey, Bub&quot;, which was originally written for &quot;Pirates&quot;. Jones then relocated to Paris.

===Period of transition: 1983–1989===
In 1983, Jones lived in Paris for four months, writing new material for her third full-length solo album, &quot;The Magazine&quot;, released in September 1984. &quot;The Magazine&quot; was produced by Jones and James Newton Howard and included a three-song suite, subtitled &quot;Rorschachs&quot;, which featured multi-tracked vocals and minimalist synth patterns. The lead single, &quot;The Real End&quot;, reached No. 82 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1984.

Jones took a four-year break from her recording schedule, largely attributed to the deaths of her mentor Bob Regher as well as her father, Richard Loris Jones, that same year. During this period, she replaced Shirley Jones for the role of the Fairy Godmother in Filmation&#x27;s 1987 film, &quot;Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night&quot;, including a performance of the original song &quot;Love is the Light Inside Your Heart&quot;.

After a successful tour of Norway and Sweden, and then opening for Ray Charles in Israel with Michael Lang managing her, she returned to the US, signed to Geffen Records by Gary Gersh, who teamed her with Steely Dan&#x27;s Walter Becker for her long-awaited fourth album. In September 1988, the two of them began work on &quot;Flying Cowboys&quot;. The album was released in September 1989, and produced two hits: &quot;Satellites&quot;, which hit No. 1 on the new Adult radio format; and &quot;The Horses&quot;, co-written with Becker. The latter song was covered by Kenny Loggins, and also featured in the movie &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996). &quot;The Horses&quot; also became an Australian No. 1 hit single for Daryl Braithwaite when he covered it in 1991. &quot;Flying Cowboys&quot; made the US Top 40, reaching No. 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with the college radio hit &quot;Satellites&quot; making it to No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album was certified Gold in 1997.

Her 1988 collaboration with Rob Wasserman, &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; on his album &quot;Duets&quot;, earned Jones a Grammy Award nomination for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Female in 1989. Her duet with Dr. John, a cover of &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot;, won her second Grammy Award in 1990, this time in the category of Best Jazz Vocal Collaboration.

===Experimentation and change: 1990–2001===

Following a tour with Lyle Lovett, Jones enlisted David Was to produce her first album of jazz covers. Her producer chose an innovative approach and she agreed, thus the Argentinian flavored &quot;Pop Pop&quot;, set the pace for what would become a habit with Jones - mixing styles of jazz and pop and not staying in one genre for a whole recording: Tin Pan Alley to Jimi Hendrix. The album, released in September 1991, was a hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Contemporary Jazz Albums, peaking at No. 8, but became her least commercially successful record yet, reaching No. 121 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Soon after, The Orb issued &quot;Little Fluffy Clouds&quot;, featuring a sampled Jones interview. However, Jones&#x27; record company objected to the unauthorized use of her voice and pursued the issue in the court system. In 1992 she toured extensively with Rob Wasserman, with whom she had collaborated in the mid-1980s.

Her swan song for Geffen Records was &quot;Traffic from Paradise&quot;, released in September 1993. The album was slightly more successful than its predecessor, reaching No. 111 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was notable for its collaboration with Leo Kottke, its musical diversity, and a cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;, which was originally planned to be the title track for the Oscar-winning film &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry.&quot; Before his death, Bowie was quoted as saying that this version was his favorite cover of his work.

Throughout this period, her songs were featured in a number of films and television series, including &quot;House M.D.&quot;, &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;, &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot;, &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, &quot;Friends with Money&quot; and the French film &quot;Subway&quot;. Jones sang a duet with Lyle Lovett on &quot;North Dakota&quot; for his 1992 album &quot;Joshua Judges Ruth&quot; and has also sung on albums by John Mellencamp, Leo Kottke and Arlo Guthrie.

Jones&#x27; first solo shows in 1994 paved the way for her acoustic album &quot;Naked Songs&quot;, released in September 1995 through a one-off deal with Reprise Records. The album, which reached No. 121 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, featured acoustic re-workings of Jones classics and album material, but no new songs. The same year, Jones produced Leo Kottke&#x27;s &quot;Peculiaroso&quot; album. 

Emphasizing her experimentation and change, Jones embraced electronic music for &quot;Ghostyhead&quot;, released on Reprise Records in June 1997. The album, a collaboration with Rick Boston (both are credited with production and with twenty-one instruments in common), found Jones employing beats, loops, and electronic rhythms, and also showcased Jones&#x27; connection with the trip hop movement of the mid-to-late 1990s. Despite critical acclaim, it did not meet with commercial success, peaking at No. 159 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Jones&#x27; second album of cover versions, &quot;It&#x27;s Like This&quot;, was released on the independent record label Artemis Records in September 2000. The album included cover versions of material by artists including The Beatles, Steely Dan, Marvin Gaye, and the Gershwin brothers. It made it onto three &quot;Billboard&quot; charts – No.148 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, No. 10 on Top Internet Albums, and No. 42 on Top Independent Albums. The album also secured Jones another Grammy Award nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album. Her cover art design (shared with a staff artist but never credited to Jones) won numerous awards and is in the book Best Album Covers.

In November 2001, Artemis issued a release of archival material titled &quot;Live at Red Rocks&quot; with cover art by a young fan who had recently died in a swimming accident. Her parents brought her drawing of flying horses to one of Jones&#x27; shows in Oregon, and Jones used it for this live release.

===Artistic renaissance: 2002–present===
After &quot;Ghostyhead&quot;, Jones largely retired from public view, tending her garden and bringing up her teenage daughter Charlotte.

Released on the independent label V2 in October 2003, &quot;The Evening of My Best Day&quot; featured influences from jazz, Celtic folk, blues, R&amp;B, rock, and gospel, and spawned a successful and lengthy spurt of touring. The album peaked at No. 189 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. She invited punk bass icon Mike Watt (the Minutemen, Iggy Pop) to perform on &quot;It Takes You There&quot;, while &quot;Ugly Man&quot; was a direct aim at the George Bush &#x27;regime&#x27; evoking, with an anthem-like Hugh Masekela arrangement, what she termed &quot;the Black Panther horns&quot;, and calling for &quot;revolution, everywhere that you&#x27;re not looking, revolution.&quot;
Renewed interest in Jones led to the three-disc anthology &quot;Duchess of Coolsville: An Anthology&quot;, released through reissue specialists Rhino in June 2005. A lavish package designed by Lee Cantelon, the alphabetically arranged release featured album songs, live material, covers, and demos, and featured essays by Jones as well as various collaborators, as well as tributes from artists including Randy Newman, Walter Becker, Quincy Jones, and Tori Amos.

Also in 2005, Jones was invited to take part in her boyfriend and collaborator Lee Cantelon&#x27;s music version of his book &quot;The Words&quot;, a book of the words of Christ, set into simple chapters and themes. Cantelon&#x27;s idea was to have various artists recite the text over primal rock music, but Jones elected to try something that had never been done, to improvise her own impression of the texts, melody and lyric, in stream of consciousness sessions, rather than read Jesus&#x27; words. The sessions were recorded at an artist&#x27;s loft on Exposition Boulevard in Culver City. When Cantelon could no longer finish the project, Jones picked it up as her own record and hired Rob Schnaf to finish the production at Sunset Sound in 2007, and the result was &quot;The Sermon on Exposition Boulevard&quot;, released on the independent New West Records in February 2007. It included &quot;Circle in the Sand&quot;, recorded for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Friends with Money&quot; (2006), for which Jones also cut &quot;Hillbilly Song&quot;. &quot;The Sermon on Exposition Boulevard&quot; debuted at No. 158 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 12 on the Top Independent Albums tally. Writer Ann Powers included this on her list of Grammy-worthy CDs for 2007.

For her next project, &quot;Balm in Gilead&quot; (2009), Jones opted to finish half-written songs dating back as far as 1986 (&quot;Wild Girl&quot;) as well as include new ones (the 2008-penned &quot;The Gospel of Carlos, Norman and Smith&quot;, &quot;Bonfires&quot;). The album also included a new recording of &quot;The Moon Is Made of Gold&quot;, a song written by her father Richard Loris Jones in 1954. Ben Harper, Victoria Williams, Jon Brion, Alison Krauss and the late Vic Chesnutt all made contributions to the album.

In May 2010, Jones performed at the Sydney Opera House as part of the Vivid Live festival. Jones also served as the narrator of Cam Archer&#x27;s 2010 film &quot;Shit Year&quot;.

On September 18, 2012, Jones released &quot;The Devil You Know&quot; on Fantasy/Concord Records. &quot;The Devil You Know&quot; includes a collection of covers produced by Ben Harper, including a solo version of &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;. Shortly afterward she left Los Angeles and moved to New Orleans.

In 2015, Jones released her album &quot;The Other Side of Desire&quot;, and the single &quot;Jimmy Choos&quot; which references the shoe brand. A documentary film, &quot;Rickie Lee Jones: The Other Side of Desire&quot;, on the making of the album, was also released. It was her first album of all new original material since &quot;Balm in Gilead&quot; six years earlier.

In 2019, Jones released a single of the Paul Rodgers/Simon Kirke song, &quot;Bad Company&quot;, followed by her album &quot;Kicks&quot; which included &quot;Bad Company&quot; and cover versions of many other songs. In June of that year, she played at the Glastonbury Festival.

In 2021, Jones&#x27;s memoir &quot;Last Chance Texaco: Chronicles of an American Troubadour&quot; was released by Grove Press. Simon and Schuster bought the audio book rights.

==Activism==
In 2001, Jones was the organizer of the web community &quot;Furniture for the People&quot;, which was founded by Jones to promote &quot;peace and activism&quot;, and to act as a public forum. Members of the group engage in activities such as gardening, social activism, bootleg exchange and left-wing politics.

===Grammy Awards===
The Grammy Awards are awarded annually by The Recording Academy of the United States for outstanding achievements in the music industry. Often considered the highest music honor, the awards were established in 1958. Jones has won two awards, from eight nominations.

<text>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) is the largest municipal utility in the United States with 8,100 megawatts of electric generating capacity (2021–2022) and delivering an average of 435 million gallons of water per day (487,000 acre-ft per year) to more than four million residents and local businesses in the City of Los Angeles and several adjacent cities and communities in southwestern Los Angeles County, California.

It was founded in 1902 to supply water to residents and businesses in the city of Los Angeles and several of its immediately adjacent communities. In 1917, LADWP began to deliver electricity to portions of the city. It has been involved in a number of controversies and media portrayals over the years, including the 1928 St. Francis Dam failure and the books &quot;Water and Power&quot; and &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot;.

==History==
===Private operators===

By the middle of the 19th century, Los Angeles&#x27;s rapid population growth magnified problems with the city&#x27;s water distribution system. At that time, a system of open, often polluted ditches, was supplying water for agricultural production but was not suited to provide water to homes. In 1853, the city council rejected as &quot;excessive&quot; a closed-pipe system that would serve homes directly. As a solution, the city allowed &quot;water carriers with jugs and horse-drawn wagons…to serve the city&#x27;s domestic [water] needs.&quot; By 1857 the council decided that the system needed to be updated, granting William G. Dryden franchise rights to provide homes with water through a system of underground water mains. The initial system served only a few homes using a network of wooden pipes. In December 1861, heavy rains destroyed the system and Dryden gave up his franchise. The city attempted contracting out water distribution rights to others, but none of the systems resulting from these contracts were successful.

The city&#x27;s previous attempts to allow others to develop a water system on its behalf prompted the city council to relinquish its rights to the water in the Los Angeles River in 1868. The city of Los Angeles could no longer benefit from their municipal water distribution business. John S. Griffen, Solomon Lazard, and Prudent Beaudry, created the Los Angeles City Water Company, which violated many of the provisions of its lease on the Los Angeles River, including secretly tunneling under the river to extract 150 times as much water as the lease allowed. As the end of the lease drew near in the mid-1890s, popular support began to build for a return to complete municipal control of the local water supply.

===Public control===

Fred Eaton proposed that tax revenues would enable Los Angeles to provide water to its residents without charging them for the use of water directly. During Eaton&#x27;s nine-year term as the superintending engineer of the Los Angeles City Water Company, he headed a large expansion of the company&#x27;s water system. Eaton left his position in 1886 when he was elected City Engineer. In early 1897, city engineers created plans for an updated water system and the Los Angeles City Water Company&#x27;s lease was not be renewed beyond its expiration date, July 21, 1898. In early 1898, talks between the city and the Los Angeles City Water Company began to take over the company&#x27;s current water system.

During negotiations it was decided that the current senior employees of the Los Angeles City Water Company would keep their jobs in order to ensure that the water system could continue to operate. It was not guaranteed that William Mulholland, who took over as superintending engineer after Eaton, would have a position working with the city-owned water system. Mulholland did not produce records the city officials requested during negotiations. It was discovered that neither the requested records nor a map of the water system existed. Mulholland, who was in charge of the non-existent records, claimed that he memorized all necessary information, including the size of every inch of pipe and the age and location of every valve. Mulholland secured a job with the city when he demonstrated his ability to recall the information. He then intervened with the company&#x27;s principal stockholder, advising him to accept the city&#x27;s offer of two million dollars for the system.

===Power delivery===
The Los Angeles Bureau of Power and Light was formed in 1911 to administer the electrical system in the city that supplied power generated by private companies. In 1922, it purchased Southern California Edison&#x27;s distribution system within the city limits. In 1937, when the Bureau purchased the power system of the Los Angeles Gas and Electric Corporation, it became the dominant power supplier in the city. That year, the bureau merged with the Bureau of Water Works and Supply to become the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP). In 1939, LADWP became the sole electrical service provider for the city of Los Angeles.

The Bureau first offered municipal electricity in 1917 when their Power Plant No. 1, a hydroelectric power plant located in San Francisquito Canyon powered by the Los Angeles Aqueduct, began generating electricity. It ultimately produced 70.5 megawatts and is still in operation, producing enough electricity for 37,500 Los Angeles homes.

Three years later, in 1920, Power Plant No. 2 was added, but destroyed when the St. Francis Dam failed. However, the plant was completely rebuilt and back in service by November 1928. It remains in operation today, having the capacity to generate 18 megawatts.

On January 17, 1994, the city of Los Angeles experienced its one and only total system black-out as a result of the Northridge earthquake. Much of the power was restored within a few hours.

In September 2005, a DWP worker accidentally cut power lines that caused over half of Los Angeles to be without power for one and one-half hours.

===Notable events and controversies===
On March 12, 1928, the St. Francis Dam, built and operated by the LADWP, collapsed catastrophically. The disaster was the second-greatest loss of life in California&#x27;s history, after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. The ensuing flood caused devastation to present-day Valencia, Newhall and the cities in the Santa Clara River Valley, taking the lives of some 425 people. The high death toll was due, in part, to confusion and mis-communication by and between employees of both the LADWP and Southern California Edison, who also had facilities and operations in the area. The confusion led to a lack of prompt warnings being sent to the downriver communities. Those cities included Piru, Fillmore, Santa Paula, and San Buenaventura. Mulholland assumed full responsibility for the disaster and retired the following year.

The LADWP has been a leading actor in the struggle over access to water from the Owens Valley, starting with its initial acquisition of water rights, as well as acquiring farms and governance of Mono Lake and Owens Lake.

The LADWP played a role in the development of Hoover Dam and bringing its energy to Los Angeles. The LADWP continued to operate the Hoover Dam electrical facility alongside Southern California Edison until 1987.

On October 10, 2011, the LADWP, along with the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Cleantech Alliance, founded the LA Cleantech Incubator.

In October 2022, LADWP lost a lawsuit against the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District for failure to control dust on Owens Lake near sensitive sacred tribal land claiming that they were not responsible for the pollution.

===Criticism over excessive overtime and payroll cost===
The LADWP has been criticized for allowing excessive overtime. In 2018, 306 of its workers took home more than $100,000 in overtime pay, while the agency paid $250 million for overtime, a new high for the agency.
The most egregious example of this is a security worker who was paid $314,000 in overtime, on a listed base pay of $25,000, along with three peers who were paid more than $200,000 overtime each. (The nationwide median wage for security officers was $28,500 in 2018.)
One policy which enables these large overtime payouts is a provision in the union contracts which requires a normal shift worked after more than one hour of overtime to be paid at double time, as well as that overtime is not based on working more than 40 hours in a week, but on working time beyond a &quot;normal&quot; shift.

A separate study found that LADWP&#x27;s yearly payroll expense per customer was $490, significantly higher than the nationwide median for large utilities of $280 per customer.

==Power system==

In 2019–20, LADWP supplied more than 21,130 gigawatt hours (GWH) to more than 1.5 million residential and business customers, as well as about 5,200 in the Owens Valley.

The LADWP operates four natural gas-fired generating stations within city boundaries, which combined with other natural gas sources, account for 24% of capacity. It receives 21% of its electricity from coal-fired plants in Utah and Arizona, but plans to transition away from coal by 2025. A further 14% is generated using nuclear power, which is from the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in Arizona. It receives about 2% of its electricity from hydropower, most coming from Hoover Dam and the rest coming from the Los Angeles Aqueduct system itself as the water descends from its mountain sources.

The LADWP, along with raw water deliveries and lake level management from the California Department of Water Resources, also operates the Castaic Power Plant as a pumped storage facility. Water flows from the upper reservoir to the lower during the day, generating power when demand is highest, and is pumped back up at night when excess capacity is available. About 1,600 megawatts, or 22% of the total capacity, is generated at this facility.

LADWP maintains a diverse and vertically integrated power generation, transmission and distribution system that spans five Western states, and delivers electricity to more than 4 million people in Los Angeles.

=== Electricity mix ===
The Los Angeles City Council voted in 2004 to direct the LADWP to generate 20% of its energy (excluding Hoover Dam) from clean sources by 2010, a goal which was met and exceeded. The LADWP expected to achieve 25 percent renewables by 2016 and 33 percent by 2020, both which have been met and exceeded. As of 2020, &quot;green power&quot; renewable energy sources accounted for 37% of the LADWP&#x27;s capacity, including the 120 MW Pine Tree Wind Farm, the largest municipally-owned wind farm in the United States. LADWP is also investing in photovoltaic solar throughout the Southwest and geothermal sources in the Salton Sea area.

In March 2021, LADWP joined with Mayor Eric Garcetti, United States Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, leading energy scientists, and local elected officials to announce the results of the Los Angeles 100% Renewable Energy Study (&quot;LA100&quot;). The study, which was conducted by renewable energy experts at the U.S. Department of Energy&#x27;s National Renewable Energy Laboratory, laid out a pathway for LADWP to achieve a 100% renewable energy grid as early as 2035 and by 2045 at the latest. The pathway includes significant deployment of renewable and zero-carbon energy by 2035, including wind and solar resources accounting for 69% to 87% of generated power.

As of 2020, the largest component of the power supply was renewable energy at about 37%. The second-largest component was natural gas, at about 24%. Coal-fired power made up a further 21%. By contrast, the California investor-owned utilities SCE, PG&amp;E, and SDG&amp;E, had all eliminated their use of coal. In 2013, LADWP announced it would become coal-free by 2025 by divesting its 21% stake in Navajo Generating Station in 2016 and converting the Intermountain Power Plant to run on natural gas.

====Undergrounding====
Most of the power lines in Los Angeles were built above-ground before it became customary to run power lines below-ground. Starting in 2007, LADWP has a long-term project to upgrade the overhead power lines and convert them to underground. This difficult conversion has been slowed by budget constraints, the impact on traffic, the pursuit of other modernization projects, and the lingering effects of a workforce reduction over the last decade. Budget issues are particularly acute in the department&#x27;s transmission system, where underground transmission costs about 10 to 14 times the cost of overhead transmission, per unit length, and the technical and environmental challenges which confront such installations. Additionally, undergrounding of the three 500 kV transmission lines (five lines, if the Pacific AC Intertie&#x27;s two 500 kV lines terminating in Los Angeles are included) is presently technically infeasible. Upgrading the overhead lines is expected to take 10 to 15 years. The upgrading of LADWP&#x27;s overhead power lines consists of eliminating the V-shape brackets on the power poles that are holding up the crossarm and replacing them with cross-brackets that are put on the crossarm. Some of the wooden power poles are being replaced with metal poles. Also included in the upgrade of overhead power lines, are the upgrades of the insulators for the lower voltage distribution power lines, which are more modern than the old-fashioned ceramic insulators. The new modern insulators for lower voltage distribution lines look identical to Southern California Edison&#x27;s distribution insulators.

The department recently completed two 230 kV underground projects using an innovative cable technology which does not utilize oil as an insulator. The oilless cable mitigates the environmental issues associated with oil-type cable.

The 315 megawatt capacity Scattergood Steam Plant (Unit 3) to West Los Angeles (Receiving Station K, &quot;Olympic&quot;) 230 kV line is having to be replaced after only 45 years of operations, due to multiple failures within this rather long single-circuit, oil-filled, &quot;pipe type&quot; cable.

==Water system==
The LADWP provided about 159 billion gallons (602 million cubic meters) of water in 2019, to 735,600 water service connections, pumping it through of pipe. In fiscal years 2016–2020:

*48% of the water came from the Sierra Nevada via the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which is transported by gravity, and consequently utilizes no electric power;
*41% came from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which transports water from the California Aqueduct and Colorado River Aqueduct, which utilizes significant electric power, much of which originates at Hoover Dam, which LADWP operated for nearly 50 years;
*9% was from local groundwater, a resource that is actively managed and allocated, but is continually being threatened by chemical pollutants, such as MTBE and perchlorates;
*2% came from recycled water and was used for irrigation, recreation, and industrial purposes.

The use of water from specific sources can vary greatly from year to year.

The prospect of increased demand coupled with reduced supply from the Mono and Owens basins is causing the LADWP to look into a number of new water sources, including a new direct connection to the California Aqueduct, increased use of recycled water, use of stormwater capture and reuse, and increased conservation. Many of the old pipelines are beginning to wear out, or are at capacity and insufficient to handle future demand. LADWP has undertaken pipeline replacement projects on many L.A. boulevards like Exposition and Olympic.

==Service territory==
In addition to Los Angeles, LADWP provides services to parts of:
*Bishop, California
*Culver City, California
*South Pasadena, California
*West Hollywood, California

Over its service territory, LADWP serves four million residents and businesses.

==Governance==

===Board of Water and Power Commissioners===
LADWP is overseen by the five-member Los Angeles Board of Water and Power Commissioners, who are appointed by the Mayor of Los Angeles and confirmed by the Los Angeles City Council for five-year terms. The board sets policy for the Department of Water and Power and votes on utility rates, renewable energy projects, and pension tiers for LADWP employees.

The Board meets regularly on the second and fourth Tuesday of each month at 10:00 a.m. Currently, the Board is observing physical distancing measures in accordance with California Governor Gavin Newsom&#x27;s order for COVID-19 prevention.

Regular meeting agendas are available to the public at least 72 hours before the Board meets. The agenda for meetings contains a brief general description of the items to be considered. The Board may consider an item not on the agenda only in limited circumstances consistent with the Brown Act.

On May 26, 2023, Cynthia Ruiz, the first Native American to serve on the Los Angeles Board of Water and Power Commissioners was informed by the deputy mayor that she was being removed as a commissioner less than one year into her four-year term, which was confirmed that day by an email from Mayor Karen Bass, whose decision it was. George McGraw was sworn in as a commissioner on June 20, replacing Ruiz.

===Executive management===
The general manager, senior assistant general managers, chief financial officer, and managing senior assistant city attorney (under the Los Angeles City Attorney) manage operations.

On January 31, 2014, Ron Nichols resigned as chief of the LADWP amid ongoing controversies regarding the LADWP.

On February 21, 2014, Marcie L. Edwards was unanimously confirmed by the Los Angeles City Council on February 21, 2014. She is the first woman to lead the LADWP. At the time of her nomination, Edwards was Anaheim&#x27;s City Manager. Prior to her appointment as Anaheim&#x27;s City Manager, Edwards served as chief of Anaheim Public Utilities for 13 years. Edwards previously worked at the LADWP for 24 years, starting at the age of 19 as a clerk typist.

In August 2016, Marcie L. Edwards announced her retirement. On August 16, 2016, the Los Angeles Board of Water and Power Commissioners appointed David H. Wright Interim General Manager, and requested the City Council to confirm his appointment as permanent General Manager. Wright remained General Manager until 2019, when he resigned following a raid by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of LADWP Headquarters. Wright was then investigated and sentenced to 72 months in federal prison for accepting bribes from a lawyer to ensure the approval of a three-year $30 million no-bid contract.

LADWP veteran Martin L. Adams was confirmed by City Council as General Manager on September 13, 2019.

In 2024, the incoming head of the municipal agency Janisse Quiñones had an annual salary of $750,000. After Karen Bass nominated her, the City Council unanimously approved her for the highest-paying post in Los Angeles government.

==Headquarters==
LADWP is headquartered in a Corporate-International Style building designed by A.C. Martin &amp; Associates and completed in May 1965. The 17-story building was constructed on Bunker Hill with the purpose of consolidating 11 building offices scattered across Downtown Los Angeles and housing LADWP&#x27;s 3,200 employees. On September 21, 2012, it was designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.

The General Office Building of the Los Angeles Department of Water &amp; Power was renamed the John Ferraro Building on November 16, 2000, after the late Los Angeles City Councilman John Ferraro. The building was featured extensively in the 2010 science fiction thriller film &quot;Inception&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Unusually for a municipal public utility, LADWP has been mentioned several times in popular culture, both fiction and nonfiction:
* The 1974 Roman Polanski film &quot;Chinatown,&quot; a fictionalized story based on the California Water Wars, was inspired by LADWP&#x27;s efforts to acquire land and water rights.
* In 1982 the University of California Press published William L. Kahrl&#x27;s book &quot;Water and Power: The Conflict over Los Angeles&#x27; Water Supply in the Owen&quot; (). The book examined the development of water policy in the American West, particularly concentrating on the role of William Mulholland and the LADWP.
* The 1986 book &quot;Cadillac Desert: The American West and its Disappearing Water&quot; by Marc Reisner () is about land development and water policy in the western United States. The subsequent television documentary of the same name devotes an entire episode to &quot;Mulholland&#x27;s Dream&quot; to provide plentiful water for Los Angeles.
*The 1997 film &quot;Volcano&quot;, about a volcano under Los Angeles, mentions the LADWP.
* The 2022 TV series &quot;The Lincoln Lawyer&quot;, based on the bestselling novels by Michael Connelly, is about an iconoclastic idealist criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles who runs his practice out of the back seat of his Lincoln. This TV series includes many scenes at the John Ferraro Building, headquarters for LADWP.

<text>The Los Angeles Aqueduct system, comprising the Los Angeles Aqueduct (Owens Valley aqueduct) and the Second Los Angeles Aqueduct, is a water conveyance system, built and operated by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The Owens Valley aqueduct was designed and built by the city&#x27;s water department, at the time named The Bureau of Los Angeles Aqueduct, under the supervision of the department&#x27;s Chief Engineer William Mulholland. The system delivers water from the Owens River in the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains to Los Angeles.

The aqueduct&#x27;s construction was controversial from the start, as water diversions to Los Angeles eliminated the Owens Valley as a viable farming community. Clauses in the city&#x27;s charter originally stated that the city could not sell or provide surplus water to any area outside the city, forcing adjacent communities to annex themselves into Los Angeles.

The aqueduct&#x27;s infrastructure also included the completion of the St. Francis Dam in 1926 to provide storage in case of disruption to the system. The dam&#x27;s collapse two years later killed at least 431 people, halted the rapid pace of annexation, and eventually led to the formation of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California to build and operate the Colorado River Aqueduct to bring water from the Colorado River to Los Angeles County.

The continued operation of the Los Angeles Aqueduct has led to public debate, legislation, and court battles over its environmental impacts on Mono Lake and other ecosystems.

==First Los Angeles Aqueduct==
===Construction===
The aqueduct project began in 1905 when the voters of Los Angeles approved a bond for the &#x27;purchase of lands and water and the inauguration of work on the aqueduct&#x27;. On June 12, 1907, a second bond was passed with a budget of to fund construction.

Construction began in 1908 and was divided into eleven divisions. The city acquired three limestone quarries, two tufa quarries and it constructed and operated a cement plant in Monolith, California, which could produce 1,200 barrels of Portland cement per day. Regrinding mills were also built and operated by the city at the tufa quarries. To move 14 million ton-miles of freight, the city contracted with Southern Pacific to build a 118 mile long rail system from the Monolith mills to Olancha.

The number of men who were on the payroll the first year was 2,629 and this number peaked at 6,060 in May 1909. In 1910, employment dropped to 1,150 due to financial reasons but rebounded later in the year. In 1911 and 1912, employment ranged from 2,800 to 3,800 workers. The number of laborers working on the aqueduct at its peak was 3,900. In 1913, the City of Los Angeles completed construction of the first Los Angeles Aqueduct.

===Route===
The aqueduct as originally constructed consisted of six storage reservoirs and of conduit. Beginning north of Blackrock (Inyo County), the aqueduct diverts the Owens River into an unlined canal to begin its journey south to the Lower San Fernando Reservoir. This reservoir was later renamed the Lower Van Norman Reservoir.

The original project consisted of of open unlined canal, of lined open canal, of covered concrete conduit, of concrete tunnels, steel siphons, of railroad track, two hydroelectric plants, three cement plants, of power lines, of telephone line, of roads and was later expanded with the construction of the Mono Extension and the Second Los Angeles Aqueduct.

The aqueduct uses gravity alone to move the water and also uses the water to generate electricity, which makes it cost-efficient to operate.

===Reactions by impacted communities===

The construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct effectively eliminated the Owens Valley as a viable farming community and eventually devastated the Owens Lake ecosystem. A group labeled the &quot;San Fernando Syndicate&quot; – including Fred Eaton, Mulholland, Harrison Otis (the publisher of The Los Angeles Times), Henry Huntington (an executive of the Pacific Electric Railway), and other wealthy individuals – were a group of investors who bought land in the San Fernando Valley allegedly based on inside knowledge that the Los Angeles aqueduct would soon irrigate it and encourage development. Although there is disagreement over the actions of the &quot;syndicate&quot; as to whether they were a &quot;diabolical&quot; cabal or only a group that united the Los Angeles business community behind supporting the aqueduct, Eaton, Mulholland and others connected with the project have long been accused of using deceptive tactics and underhanded methods to obtain water rights and block the Bureau of Reclamation from building water infrastructure for the residents in Owens Valley, and creating a false sense of urgency around the completion of the aqueduct for Los Angeles residents.
By the 1920s, the aggressive pursuit of water rights and the diversion of the Owens River precipitated the outbreak of violence known as the California water wars. Farmers in Owens Valley, following a series of unmet deadlines from LADWP, attacked infrastructure, dynamiting the aqueduct numerous times, and opened sluice gates to divert the flow of water back into Owens Lake. The lake has never been refilled, and is now maintained with a minimum level of surface water to prevent the introduction of dangerous, toxic lake-floor dust into the local community.

=== St. Francis Dam failure ===
In 1917, The Bureau of Los Angeles Aqueduct sought to build a holding reservoir to regulate flow and provide hydroelectric power and storage in case of disruption to the aqueduct system. The initial site chosen was in Long Valley along the Owens River, but Eaton, who had bought up much of the valley in anticipation of the need for a reservoir, refused to sell the land at the price offered by Los Angeles. Mulholland then made the decision to move the reservoir to San Francisquito Canyon above what is now Santa Clarita, California. The resulting St. Francis Dam was completed in 1926 and created a reservoir capacity of 38,000 acre-feet (47,000,000 m3). On March 12, 1928, the dam catastrophically failed, sending a wall of water down the canyon, ultimately reaching the Pacific Ocean near Ventura and Oxnard, and killing at least 431 people. The resulting investigation and trial led to the retirement of William Mulholland as the head of the Los Angeles Bureau of Water Works and Supply in 1929. The dam failure is the worst man-made flood disaster in the US in the 20th century and the second largest single-event loss of life in California history after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

==Mono Basin extension==
In an effort to find more water, the city of Los Angeles reached farther north. In 1930, Los Angeles voters passed a third bond to buy land in the Mono Basin and fund the Mono Basin extension. The extension diverted flows from Rush Creek, Lee Vining Creek, Walker Creek, and Parker Creek that would have flowed into Mono Lake. The construction of the Mono extension consisted of an intake at Lee Vining Creek, the Lee Vining conduit to the Grant Reservoir on Rush Creek, which would have a capacity of , the Mono Craters Tunnel to the Owens River, and a second reservoir, later named Crowley Lake with a capacity of in Long Valley at the head of the Owens River Gorge.

Completed in 1940, diversions began in 1941. The Mono Extension has a design capacity of of flow to the aqueduct. However, the flow was limited to due to the limited downstream capacity of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. Full appropriation of the water could not be met until the second aqueduct was completed in 1970.

=== The Mono extension&#x27;s impact on Mono Basin and litigation ===
From 1940 to 1970, water exports through the Mono Extension averaged per year and peaked at in 1974. Export licenses granted by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) in 1974 increased exports to per year. These export levels severely impacted the region&#x27;s fish habitat, lake level, and air quality, which led to a series of lawsuits. The results of the litigation culminated with a SWRCB decision to restore fishery protection (stream) flows to specified minimums, and raise Mono Lake to above sea level. The agreement limited further exports from the Mono Basin to or less per year during the transition period.

==Second Los Angeles Aqueduct==

In 1956, the State Department of Water Resources reported that Los Angeles was exporting only of water of the available in the Owens Valley and Mono Basin. Three years later, the State Water Rights Board warned Los Angeles that they could lose rights to the water they were permitted for but not appropriating. Faced with the possible loss of future water supply, Los Angeles began the five-year construction of the aqueduct in 1965 at a cost US$89 million. Once the city received diversion permits, water exports jumped in 1970, adding 110,000 AF that year into the aqueduct system. By 1974, exports climbed to per year. Unlike the First Aqueduct which was built entirely by Public Works, the Second Los Angeles Aqueduct was primarily built on contract by various private construction firms including R.A. Wattson Co., Winston Bros., and the Griffith Co. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power managed the project and performed some finishing construction on the Mojave conduit and Jawbone &amp; Dove Spring pipelines.

===Route===
The aqueduct was designed to flow and begins at the Merritt Diversion Structure at the junction of the North and South Haiwee Reservoirs, south of Owens Lake, and runs roughly parallel to the first aqueduct. Water flows entirely by gravity from an elevation of at the Haiwee Reservoir through two power drops to an elevation of at the Upper Van Norman Reservoir.

The Second Aqueduct was not built as a single contiguous conduit. For design and construction purposes the aqueduct was divided into Northern and Southern sections and the two are connected by the San Francisquito Tunnels, which are part of the First Aqueduct.

The Northern Section carries water starting at the North Haiwee Reservoir through the Haiwee Bypass passing around the South Haiwee Reservoir. The flow then continues south through a series of pressure pipelines and concrete conduits where it connects with the First Aqueduct at the North Portal of the Elizabeth Tunnel near the Fairmont Reservoir.

The San Francisquito Tunnels (which include the Elizabeth Tunnel) have a flow capacity of and are large enough to handle the flow of both aqueducts. Once the combined flow reaches the penstocks above Power Plant #2, water is diverted into the Southern Section of the second aqueduct through the Drinkwater Tunnel to the Drinkwater Reservoir.

The last segment of pipe, known as the Saugus Pipeline, carries water south past Bouquet Canyon, Soledad Canyon and Placerita Canyon in the city of Santa Clarita. From there it roughly parallels Sierra Highway before it enters Magazine Canyon near the Terminal structure and Cascades. Water from the Terminal structure can then flow to either the Cascade or penstock to the Foothill Power Plant and into the Upper Van Norman Reservoir.

In addition to the construction in the Northern and Southern sections, improvements were also made to the lined canal between the Alabama Gates and the North Haiwee Reservoir in the Northern Section that consisted of adding sidewalls to both sides of the canal and the raising of overcrossings. This work increased the capacity of the lined canal from to cfs.

===Second aqueduct&#x27;s impact on the water system===

The increased flows provided by the second aqueduct lasted only from 1971 through 1988. In 1974 the environmental consequences of the higher exports were first being recognized in the Mono Basin and Owens Valley. This was followed by a series of court ordered restrictions imposed on water exports, which resulted in Los Angeles losing water. In 2005, the Los Angeles Urban Water Management Report reported that 40–50% of the aqueduct&#x27;s historical supply is now devoted to ecological resources in Mono and Inyo counties.

==Influence on Los Angeles and the county==
From 1909 to 1928, the city of Los Angeles grew from to . This was due largely to the aqueduct, and the city&#x27;s charter which stated that the City of Los Angeles could not sell or provide surplus water to any area outside the city.
Outlying areas relied on wells and creeks for water and, as they dried up, the people in those areas realized that if they were going to be able to continue irrigating their farms and provide themselves domestic water, they would have to annex themselves to the City of Los Angeles.

Growth was so rapid that it appeared as if the city of Los Angeles would eventually assume the size of the entire county. William Mulholland continued adding capacity to the aqueduct, building the St. Francis Dam that would impound water creating the San Francisquito Reservoir, filed for additional water from the Colorado River, and began sending engineers and miners to clear the heading at the San Jacinto Tunnel that he knew was key to the construction of the Colorado River Aqueduct.

The aqueduct&#x27;s water provided developers with the resources to quickly develop the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles through World War II. Mulholland&#x27;s role in the vision and completion of the aqueduct and the growth of Los Angeles into a large metropolis is recognized with the William Mulholland Memorial Fountain, built in 1940 at Riverside Drive and Los Feliz Boulevard in Los Feliz. Mulholland Drive and Mulholland Dam are both named after him.

Many more cities and unincorporated areas would likely have annexed into the city of Los Angeles if the St. Francis Dam had not collapsed. The catastrophic failure of the St. Francis Dam in 1928 killed an estimated 431 people, flooded parts of Santa Clarita, and devastated much of the Santa Clara River Valley in Ventura County.

The failure of the dam raised the question in a number of people&#x27;s minds whether the city had engineering competence and capability to manage such a large project as the Colorado River Aqueduct despite the fact that they had built the Los Angeles Aqueduct. After the collapse, the pace of annexation came to a rapid halt when eleven nearby cities including Burbank, Glendale, Pasadena, Beverly Hills, San Marino, Santa Monica, Anaheim, Colton, Santa Ana, and San Bernardino decided to form the Metropolitan Water District with Los Angeles. The city&#x27;s growth following the formation of the MWD would be limited to 27.65 square miles.

=== Farmers ===

In 1905, the city of Los Angeles began the process of acquiring water and land rights in the Owens Valley region in preparation for the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, initially misleading farmers who were under the assumption that the purchases were intended for a local water project. Due to many farmers holding on to a very small portion of the total water in Owens Valley, no singular farmer had the means to influence or divert attention away from the desires of Los Angeles in wanting to acquire water and land rights in the region. Accordingly, farmers formed collective groups to increase their bargaining power, the most notable being the Owens Valley Irrigation District. Nevertheless, the city of Los Angeles bypassed such efforts from the collective farmer groups through engaging in checkerboarding, purchasing and acquiring surrounding land of an opposing farmer and essentially circumvent the need to buy their land altogether. By 1934, the city of Los Angeles had acquired 95% of the agricultural land in the Owens Valley.

=== Indigenous ===
According to archaeologists and anthropologists, the Paiute people, also known as &quot;Nüńwa Paya Hūp Ca’á Otūǔ’m&quot; (translates to “We are Water Ditch Coyote children&quot;), settled in the Owens Valley region as early as 600 C.E., having long adopted and specialized in a hunting and harvesting economy. 

As a result of mining and agricultural development in California in the mid-19th century following the annexation of the state as well as the subsequent influx of white settlers coming into the region, many Paiute people were relocated to what is now modern-day Porterville, California in 1863. The Paiute people that remained found it difficult to continue harvesting indigenous food sources as the ongoing siphoning of the Owens Valley water by the city of Los Angeles for the aqueduct project dramatically altered the supply of water in the surrounding region. 

In 1937, the United States Federal Government signed into the law the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, commonly known as the Land Exchange Act, which allowed Paiute people to trade 2,914 acres of allotted land to the city of Los Angeles in exchange for 1,392 acres of hospitable lands which became the Bishop, Big Pine, and Lone Pine Reservations located east from the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Nevertheless, the U.S. federal government was unable to secure for the Paiutes water rights from the city of Los Angeles, which insisted that they required a two-third vote from city residents to be able to transfer water. This left the Paiute people without adequate amounts of water to accommodate for their growing population. 

In 1994, the Department of the Interior opened an ongoing investigation looking into the water rights issues between the city of Los Angeles and the Paiute people, led by the Owens Valley Indian Water Commission, a consortium comprising the Bishop, Big Pine, and Lone Pine Reservations. 

=== Owens Valley ecosystem and agriculture ===
The impact of the Los Angeles Aqueduct Project to the Owens Valley region was immediate and detrimental to future agricultural work of local farmers. In 1923, in an effort to increase the water supply, the city of Los Angeles began purchasing vast parcels of land and commenced the drilling of new wells in the region, significantly lowering the level of groundwater in the Owens Valley, even affecting farmers who “did not sell to the city’s representatives.” By 1970, constant groundwater pumping by the city of Los Angeles had virtually dried up all the major springs in the Owens Valley, impacting the surrounding wetlands, springs, meadows, and marsh habitats.

=== Ecological disruption ===
The consequent transfer of water out of the Owens Lake and Mono Lake decimated the natural ecology of the region, transforming what was a “lush terrain into desert.” Furthermore, alkaline sediment from the receding shorelines of both Owens Lake and Mono Lake resulting from increased water usage made their way to areas of human settlement by way of being lifted from dust storms, ultimately increasing the chances of respiratory illnesses and cancer. Some of the first victims to be impacted by these dust storms were Japanese Americans interned at the Manzanar War Relocation facilities during World War II.

Despite the ecological and environmental destruction of both Mono and Owens Lake from the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, the Owens Valley and adjoining Mono Lake remain a sanctuary for many bird species that migrate to this region. The legal notion of a “Public Trust Doctrine” used by community members of Owens Valley has been successful in restoring regions of Mono Lake, Mono Highlands and the Owens Valley impacted by the Los Angeles Aqueduct, evident by the re-watering projects that have spurred revitalization of natural local ecosystems. 

In 1991, the City of Los Angeles signed the Inyo-LA Long Term Water Agreement despite objections from community members and stakeholders. Concessions of the deal included mitigation projects like the Lower Owens River Project that sought to reduce further air contamination and health risks associated with the dust storms as well as future preservation of the ecology of the Owens Valley. 

In 2001, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power commenced studies on the environmental impact of dust storms, suggesting proposals in re-watering both Mono Lake and Lake Owens.

In 2006, work commenced on the Lower Owens River Project 15 years after it was signed, helping boost the number of fish in the river, restoring marsh habitats, and promoting recreational activities such as fishing and canoeing by re-watering 62 miles of riverbed.

In 2009, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power resumed ongoing efforts to a proposed master plan in the preservation of the natural habitat of Lake Owens as part of its Owens Lake Dust Mitigation Program (OLDMP).

== Future water needs ==
Los Angeles faces significant challenges in securing its water supply for the future due to climate change, population growth, and increasing competition for resources. The city&#x27;s reliance on imported water from the Los Angeles Aqueduct (LAA), the Colorado River Aqueduct, and the California State Water Project is becoming increasingly strained. These sources are threatened by reduced Sierra Nevada snowpack, prolonged droughts, and legal disputes over water rights.

Efforts to address these challenges include transitioning to more sustainable, local sources such as reclaimed water, desalination, and rainwater harvesting. The city is also exploring integrated water management strategies, including groundwater treatment and water reuse. Additionally, demand management measures, such as incentives for water conservation and public awareness campaigns, are being implemented to reduce dependency on imported water. Innovations in water pricing and regulation are expected to play a vital role in managing future demand.

== Water scarcity ==
Water scarcity is a growing concern in Los Angeles, driven by factors such as climate change, population growth, and environmental obligations. Reduced Sierra Nevada snowpack and changing precipitation patterns have jeopardized the reliability of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, while prolonged droughts strain access to water from the Colorado River and other sources. 
Los Angeles must also balance its water needs with environmental restoration efforts. Legal requirements mandate water retention in Owens Valley and Mono Lake to address ecological damage caused by aqueduct operations. At the same time, agriculture consumes the majority of water statewide, leading to conflicts between urban and rural water use. Despite these challenges, urban water conservation measures, including rainwater harvesting and improved irrigation practices, offer promising strategies for mitigating scarcity. Increased public awareness of water scarcity&#x27;s historical and environmental roots has also led to advocacy for more sustainable water management practices, such as preserving the Los Angeles River.

==In popular culture==
* Saugus High School derives the name of its daily newsletter, The Pipeline, from an exposed portion of the first aqueduct that passes southwest of the school&#x27;s property.
* San Francisquito Canyon and DWP Power House #1 are featured in &quot;Visiting... with Huell Howser&quot; Episode 424.

== California Historical Landmark – Cascades ==
The Cascades, which was completed on November 5, 1913, is located near the intersection of Foothill Boulevard and Balboa Boulevard, four miles northwest of San Fernando. It was designated as a California Historical Landmark on July 28, 1958.

<text>Frederick Fung Kin-kee, SBS, JP (; born 17 March 1953) is a former member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong from 1991 to 1997 and from 2000 to 2016 and the former chairman of the pro-democracy Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People&#x27;s Livelihood (ADPL) from 1989 to 2007.

Fung pioneered pro-democrats&#x27; participation in electoral politics by standing in the 1983 Urban Council election. As well as his role in the Urban Council, he was also a member of the Sham Shui Po District Council. He was first elected to the Legislative Council in the 1991 direct election. He is noted for his middle-of-the-road strategy of &quot;simultaneously negotiating with and confronting&quot; Beijing and joined the Beijing-installed Provisional Legislative Council in 1996 despite the pro-democrats&#x27; boycott. Fung was a candidate for the 2012 Chief Executive election but lost in the pro-democracy primary.

He resigned from the ADPL chairmanship after the party&#x27;s defeat in the 2007 District Council election. He lost his Sham Shui Po District Council seat in 2015 and lost his re-election to the Legislative Council in 2016. Fung contested in the pro-democracy primary for the March 2018 Kowloon West by-election, but lost to Yiu Chung-yim. He subsequently declined to be a backup candidate for Yiu. He also drew the ire of former allies from the pro-democracy camp by standing in the November Kowloon West by-election, in a spoiler role against the camp&#x27;s chosen candidate, Lee Cheuk-yan.

==Education and early political career==
Fung was born in Hong Kong in 1953 with the family root of Dongguan. He entered the University of Hong Kong in 1974 but was ousted a year after because he spent too much time organising social movements and failed his exams. He then joined the pressure group Society for Community Organisation. He went to the United Kingdom in 1979 and obtained his undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree in Social Policy and Public Administration at the University of Bradford in 1982.

After he returned to Hong Kong, he was noted as one of the pioneers of the pro-democrats to participate in the electoral politics, by running in the 1983 Urban Council election, the first free direct election for the municipal council. He won a seat in Sham Shui Po East with 7,450 votes, which established his long time base in the district. At the time he was the chairman of the Hong Kong People&#x27;s Council on Public Housing Policy (PCPHP). In 1986, he co-founded the Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People&#x27;s Livelihood (ADPL) as vice chairman. The ADPL became one of the three major pro-democracy political groups in the 1980s.

==Legislative career==
===British Hong Kong Colonial period===
In 1989, he replaced Ding Lik-kiu as chairman of the ADPL. Under his chairmanship, he was initially involved in forming the United Democrats of Hong Kong, a political party which aimed to unite all democrats in 1990, but later on refused to join his fellow democrats to form the new party, citing his association represented grassroots&#x27; interest whereas the United Democrats were more focused on the &quot;middle class&quot;. At the time he also served as a member in the Hong Kong Housing Authority from 1990 to 1998.

In the first ever direct elections for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong in 1991, he ran in Kowloon West and was elected to the legislature for the first time. A moderate pan-democrat, he is known for his middle-of-the-road strategy of &quot;simultaneously negotiating with and confronting&quot; Beijing, which, in his words, is to try to keep contact with the mainland authorities so you will have a chance to convince them to listen to your views. Such stance has been criticised by the mainstream and radical democrats as opportunistic and pulled him into controversy in the run-up to the 1997 handover. In 1996, he decided to join the Beijing-controlled Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Provisional Legislative Council with his party which created by Beijing as a counter legislature against the democratic legislature under Chris Patten, the last Governor of Hong Kong&#x27;s electoral reform, while the other democrats boycotted the provisional legislature, criticising them as a backwards step for democracy.

===HKSAR period===
Amid criticism, Fung lost his seat in the 1998 Legislative Council election in Kowloon West, the first legislative election after the SAR was established along with all ADPL candidates. He returned to the Legislative Council in the 2nd Legislative Council election two years later in 2000 and was since re-elected in 2004, 2008 and 2012.

He was also member of the Sham Shui Po District Council from 1999 to 2015. He resigned as chairman of the ADPL after the 2007 District Council election, after his party received a disastrous defeat. In the 2015 District Council election, he lost his long held seat in Lai Kok to a 25-year old newcomer, Chan Wing-yan, of the pro-Beijing Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) and Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong with 99-vote margin, while former ADPL member Eric Wong Chung-ki stood in the constituency, taking away 215 votes.

On 8 December 2011, he decided to run for the 2012 Hong Kong Chief Executive election, but lost the primary election of the pan-democracy camp to Democratic Party&#x27;s Albert Ho. In the 2012 Legislative Council election, he ran for the new territory-wide District Council (Second) functional constituency &quot;super seat&quot; which was created under the 2010 Hong Kong electoral reform he supported and successfully returned to the Legislative Council. Since was ineligible to run for the same constituency in 2016 Legislative Council election as he was unseated from his District Council seat in 2015. He chose to give up his long-time base in Kowloon West and ran in the New Territories West, but failed to win any seat. His decision caused criticism as he was blamed for snatching votes from other pro-democrat candidates including Lee Cheuk-yan which led to his downfall in his long time base.

==After Legislative Council==
He participated in the pro-democracy primary of the March 2018 Kowloon West by-election after incumbent Yau Wai-ching of Youngspiration was ousted from the Legislative Council over the oath-taking controversy. His decision of running sparked intra-party conflicts. His candidacy was initially challenged by party&#x27;s young member Kalvin Ho who later withdrew from the race. Former vice-chairwoman Rosanda Mok and all ADPL&#x27;s Yau Tsim Mong and Kowloon City District Councillors quit the party in the midst of the intra-party primary, in protest against Fung&#x27;s candidacy. Fung eventually became the party&#x27;s sole representative in the pro-democracy primary. He was defeated in the telephone polls and generic ballots in the primary to Yiu Chung-yim, the legislator who was also disqualified over the oath-taking controversy. According to the primary mechanism, Fung was a backup candidate in case Yiu was barred from running in the election. However, announced that he was under pressure to withdraw as a backup candidacy as agreed in the primary if Yiu was disqualified by the Electoral Affair Commission. &quot;Someone from the progressive democracy bloc told me that if I ran in the poll, they would definitely send someone as well [to challenge me],” Fung said. “I hope my withdrawal will allow the hatred to dissipate.&quot;

In October 2018, Fung announced that he was standing in the November Kowloon West by-election, three months after quitting the ADPL, which intended to back unity pro-democracy candidate Lau Siu-lai. Amid criticism from allies, he declared that he was unhappy that another veteran, Lee Cheuk-yan, was chosen by the pro-democracy camp as Lau&#x27;s backup, rather than himself, in case she was barred from running. When Lau was in fact barred by the government, Fung began campaigning in earnest, risking a catastrophic split in the democratic vote, and seemingly unconcerned that fellow democrats called him a &quot;spoiler&quot;, &quot;sore loser&quot;, and &quot;a has-been politician who cares more about his ego than the causes he claims to espouse&quot;. As a result, Fung received 12,509 votes, about five per cent of the total vote share while Beijing-backed Chan Hoi-yan won 106,457 votes, about 900 votes more than Fung and Lee combined.

Fung unsuccessfully ran for a seat on Yau Tsim Mong District Council, in Tsim Sha Tsui West constituency, during the 2019 local elections.
He then run in the 2021 Hong Kong legislative election but failed to win a seat

<text>...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead (often abbreviated as Trail of Dead), are an American alternative rock band from Austin, Texas, formed in 1994. The band&#x27;s earliest stable lineup consisted of Conrad Keely, Jason Reece, Kevin Allen and Neil Busch, though for most of the band&#x27;s history Keely and Reece were the core members with other musicians serving for varying lengths of time. Trail of Dead had a cult following and were known for their energetic and protracted live performances. Between 1998 and 2023, the band released eleven studio albums and five EPs along with one live album and twenty-two singles. The artwork for all of the albums was created by Keely (who is also a painter) using various media. This artwork has recurring mythical and historical themes.

Their latest studio album, &quot;XI: Bleed Here Now&quot;, was released on July 15, 2022. In February 2023, the band posted on Instagram an image reading &quot;Trail closed&quot; which created rumours that the band had broken up. Although the band still exists, Conrad Keely later clarified they had no immediate plans to either tour nor make any more music in the traditional sense, citing a disastrous final tour, exhaustion, and the inhospitable state of the music industry towards smaller bands as the main drivers behind their decision.

==History==
===Formation===
Keely and Reece have been friends since their youth, and originally in Hawaii. They each formed their first bands in Olympia, Washington, where Keely studied at The Evergreen State College. Keely, a songwriter and bassist named James Olsen and a guitarist (Paul Westmoreland) started a band in the early 1990s. The band was called varied things before settling on &quot;Benedict Gehlen&quot; (named after a monk laid to rest in the St. Martin&#x27;s Abby in Olympia). That went on in various names and forms until 1993. Soon after, Keely became involved in a group called Nancyville, while Reece went on to play drums with Honeybucket and then queercore band Mukilteo Fairies (the name is a play on words, referencing the ferry boat that travels between Mukilteo and Clinton, Washington). Eventually, Keely and Reece moved to Austin, Texas. The two started playing as a duo under the moniker &quot;You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead.&quot; The band expanded eventually to include guitarist Kevin Allen and bassist Neil Busch. They then officially lengthened their name to ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead. Keely&#x27;s girlfriend from Olympia, Deanne Rowley (later Deanne McAdams), briefly played with them as a live back-up guitarist.

According to the band&#x27;s website, their name is taken from an ancient Mayan ritual chant which showed a similarity to an ancient Egyptian chant. They have also stated that this is a joke.

===Rise and success (1995–2006)===

In 1995, Trail of Dead issued their first release, a song titled &quot;Novena Without Faith&quot; on a cassette-only compilation titled &quot;Austin Live Houses&quot;, followed by another self-titled four-song cassette on Golden Hour. In January 1998, they released a self-titled full-length on Trance Syndicate.

Trail of Dead soon joined Merge Records after the Trance Syndicate label folded. The band released &quot;Madonna&quot; on Merge in late 1999 and toured the U.S., opening for labelmates Superchunk to promote it. They signed to Interscope Records and released the &quot;Relative Ways&quot; EP in 2001.

In early 2002, Trail of Dead released &quot;Source Tags &amp; Codes&quot;, which received wide acclaim, including a 10/10 rating from Pitchfork Media, later saying it is &quot;one of indie rock&#x27;s truly epic albums&quot;. Their following tour was chronicled by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, with Andrew Dansby commenting on their group dynamic as a &quot;post-punk Voltron, that just might be the most exciting unit working today.&quot;

A follow-up EP to &quot;Source Tags &amp; Codes&quot; was released in April 2003, titled &quot;The Secret of Elena&#x27;s Tomb&quot;. The EP contained the electronic track &quot;Intelligence&quot; which featured and was co-written by Tyler Jacobson from A Roman Scandal, Reece&#x27;s other band.

In July 2004, it was announced that Neil Busch had been removed from the band and Danny Wood would be taking his place on bass. Second drummer/percussionist Doni Schroader also joined the band around this time. Trail of Dead released &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; on January 25, 2005. Music videos were filmed for singles &quot;And the Rest Will Follow&quot; and &quot;Caterwaul&quot;. The band also added live keyboardist David Longoria to their touring lineup. Now a six-piece, the band toured heavily on the album, with its trademark explosive live performances and a two-drummer attack. Opening for part of this tour was Longoria&#x27;s band The Black, which featured Longoria on vocals and guitarist Alan Schaefer, with the rest of TOD filling out the group. The band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;So Divided&quot;, was released on November 14, 2006. Clay Morris replaced Longoria as live keyboardist, and eventually became a full-time member.

On April 26, 2005, their song &quot;Will You Smile Again For Me&quot; was featured at the conclusion of The Shield&#x27;s 7th episode of their 4th season, &quot;Hurt&quot;.

===Post-Interscope era (2007–2023)===
In late summer of 2007, Trail of Dead once again toured Europe, this time with drummer Aaron Ford replacing Doni Schroader. Danny Wood was absent from these performances, having quietly left the band. He would eventually be replaced by Jay Leo Phillips. The band provided the soundtrack to the 2007 film &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot;, a documentary about the formation of Roller Derby in Austin, Texas. After their overseas tour ended on March 15, 2007, Trail of Dead returned to the studio to begin recording their sixth record. In October, they supported the virtual band Dethklok on an Adult Swim college tour. In that same month, the band became independent after leaving Interscope Records due to a lack of support.

In early 2008, Trail of Dead went back into the studio without a record contract. Using their own capital, they filmed their recording experiences and released them on YouTube. On October 21, they released an EP, resembling an &quot;album teaser&quot;, titled &quot;Festival Thyme&quot; on Richter Scale Records. On February 17, 2009, a 13-track album, &quot;The Century of Self&quot; was released. In September 2010, Keely posted news of an upcoming album 2011 release, produced by Chris &quot;Frenchie&quot; Smith, with an accompanying comic book. Smith is also set to re-mix their debut eponymous album. On November 10, 2010, the band announced that their seventh album, &quot;Tao of the Dead&quot;, would be released in North America on February 8, 2011. It was also revealed that the band had stripped down to a core four-piece, and that Jay Phillips, Clay Morris and longtime guitarist Kevin Allen had been removed from the lineup. Circumstances of these departures are currently unknown. Aaron Ford recorded all of the drums for &quot;Tao of the Dead&quot;, but then left the band. The band performed live on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on February 7, 2011, debuting bassist Autry Fulbright II (from Reece side project Midnight Masses) and drummer/guitarist Jamie Miller, of the band theSTART. On February 17, 2011, it was announced that Reece would guest host Toby Ryan&#x27;s radio show on Austin&#x27;s KROX-FM (101X).

In 2012, the band recorded material for a new album in Hanover, Germany again with producer Frenchie Smith and engineer Mirko Hofmann. On August 22, the band announced their eighth studio album, &quot;Lost Songs&quot;, and released a song entitled &quot;Up To Infinity&quot;, which was dedicated to Pussy Riot. Cover art was revealed on September 6, 2012. On September 25, they released &quot;Catatonic&quot; through Spotify.

In May 2013, the band announced a forthcoming EP &quot;Tao of the Dead Part III&quot; via Twitter. Using PledgeMusic, they were taking pre-orders for special editions of the EP. In February 2014, the band announced a limited U.S. tour focused on playing music from &quot;Source Tags and Codes&quot; and plans to record their next album, a sequel to &quot;Tao of the Dead&quot;, in the spring and summer of 2014. In April 2014, they released the album &quot;Live at Rockpalast 2009&quot;. In August 2014, the band announced their ninth album, &quot;IX&quot;, using an online jigsaw puzzle. Pitchfork suggested &quot;the arrival at a crossroads&quot; for the band with the album. After a subsequent tour the band, Keely moved to Cambodia and released his debut solo album, &quot;Original Machines&quot;, in 2016. In November 2017, the band announced a European tour to celebrate the 20 year anniversary of the release of their debut album, &quot;Madonna&quot;, performing the album in full.

On November 14, 2019, the band released &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Down&quot;, the first single from their tenth album, &quot;&quot;. The second single, &quot;Into the Godless Void&quot;, was released on December 6, 2019.

In 2022 the band&#x27;s latest album, &quot;XI: Bleed Here Now&quot; was released with quadraphonic mixing. After the band posted &quot;Trail closed&quot; on Instagram there were suspicions it might disband. The band still exists, although Keely stated that among various other issues, due to the hostile state of the music industry towards smaller bands, they could no longer afford to tour and that he had no desire to do it again.

<text>Phraortes, son of Deioces, was the second king of the Median kingdom.

Like his father Deioces, Phraortes started wars against Assyria, but was defeated and killed by the Assyrian king, probably Ashurbanipal (r. 668-631 BCE).

== Biography ==
All information about him is from Herodotus. According to him (1.102), Phraortes was the son of Deioces and united all Median tribes into a single state. He also subjugated the Persians and Parthians and other nations of ancient Iran. He ruled for twenty-two years (c. 675 – c. 653 BC), however, some scholars assume that he ruled for fifty-three years, c. 678 – c. 625. Phraortes is commonly identified with Kashtariti, a chieftain in Media, although some scholars consider such an identification doubtful. He was later succeeded by his son Cyaxares.

<doc id="425251" wikidata="Q2918999" url="?curid=425251" title="Solange Gemayel">
<text>Solange Gemayel (; born 1949) is a Lebanese political figure and former First Lady of Lebanon. The widow of former President-elect Bachir Gemayel (1947–1982), who was assassinated days before he was due to take office in 1982. She co-founded the Bachir Gemayel Foundation to keep her late husband&#x27;s legacy alive.

==Political activities and views==
Solange Gemayel strongly opposed the Syrian military presence in Lebanon, and was an enemy of the Syrian-backed government which took power in 1990. She is strongly pro-Western, and in 2003 she rattled the political establishment by publicly supporting U.S. President George W. Bush in his decision to attack Iraq and depose the government of Saddam Hussein.

In 2002, she openly condemned Karim Pakradouni as the Kataeb&#x27;s &quot;imposed by force&quot; leader and argued that he betrayed the real Phalange values that her husband fought for during his lifetime.

Hosting a formal dinner at her home in August 2003, she praised what she called America&#x27;s &quot;historic step&quot; to &quot;establish democracy, fight terrorism, make peace and give the people a taste of freedom.&quot; She also joined her son, Nadim, in endorsing Hikmat Dib of the Free Patriotic Movement in an important byelection. This put her (and her son) at odds with her brother-in-law, former President Amine Gemayel, who endorsed the more moderate Henri Helou. Helou won, but by a much smaller margin than had been expected.

She was an outspoken critic at several major demonstrations against the Syrian presence and the Syrian-backed government, in the wake of the 14 February assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.

Ghattas Khoury declared in May 2005 that he would withdraw from the Beirut elections for the sole Maronite seat, enabling Saad Hariri to include Solange Gemayel on his list. Saad Hariri announced on 16 May 2005 that Gemayel would contest the election as a member of a multiconfessional electoral ticket he had compiled. On 30 May 2005, Gemayel was elected to represent the Beirut constituency. In 2009 elections, she stepped out the race in favor of her son, Nadim.

==Personal life==
Solange belongs to the Tutunji family which traces its roots to Aleppo, in present-day Syria. She married Bachir Gemayel in March 1977. Their first daughter, Maya, was born the following year. She was killed in 1980, by a car bomb intended against her father. A second daughter, Youmna, was born in 1980, and a son, Nadim, in 1982, only months before his father&#x27;s assassination. Solange Gemayel raised her two surviving children to carry on their late father&#x27;s legacy. Nadim indicated his intention to follow in the footsteps of his father and mother by participating in the political process.

In October 2017, the Lebanese justice sentenced the killers of Bachir Gemayel, 35 years after the killing, a trial she said she &quot;had been expecting&quot;.

<text>Bel Air (or Bel-Air) is a residential neighborhood on the Los Angeles Westside, in the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains in the U.S. state of California.

Together with Beverly Hills and Holmby Hills, Bel Air forms the Platinum Triangle of Los Angeles neighborhoods. Along with Beverly Hills and the Los Angeles community of Brentwood, Bel Air is also part of a high-priced area on the Westside known as the &quot;three Bs.&quot;

==History==
The community was founded in 1923 by Alphonzo Bell. Bell owned farm property in Santa Fe Springs, California, where oil was discovered. He bought a large ranch with a home on what is now Bel Air Road. He subdivided and developed the property with large residential lots, with work on the master plan led by the landscape architect Mark Daniels. He also built the Bel-Air Bay Club in Pacific Palisades and the Bel-Air Country Club. His wife chose Italian names for the streets. She also founded the Bel-Air Garden Club in 1931.

===Fires===

On November 6, 1961, a fire ignited and devastated the community of Bel Air, destroying 484 homes in the area. On December 6, 2017, a fire started by a homeless encampment burned in the same area, destroying six homes.

==Geography==
Bel Air is situated about west of Downtown Los Angeles, set entirely within the Santa Monica Mountains. It lies across Sunset Boulevard from the northern edge of the main campus of the University of California, Los Angeles. At the heart of the community sits the Bel-Air Country Club and the Hotel Bel-Air.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm and dry summers. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Bel Air has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==
The 2000 U.S. census counted 7,691 residents in the Bel Air neighborhood; with it has among the lowest population densities for the city and the county. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 8,253.

In 2000, the median age for residents was 46, which was high for city and county neighborhoods. The percentages of residents aged 50 and older was among the county&#x27;s highest.

The median yearly household income in 2008 was $207,938, the highest figure for any neighborhood or city in Los Angeles County. Renters occupied 14.5% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment-owners held 85.5%. The average household size of 2.4 people was considered typical for Los Angeles.

The 4.1% of families headed by single parents was considered low for city and county neighborhoods. The percentages of married people in Bel Air were among the county&#x27;s highest—66.0% for men and 65.7% for women. There were 808 veterans, or 12.9% of the population.

The neighborhood was considered &quot;not especially diverse&quot; ethnically within Los Angeles, with a relatively high percentage of white people. The breakdown was whites, 83.0%; Asians, 8.2%; Latinos, 4.6%; African Americans, 0.9%; and others, 3.2%. Iran (26.1%) and South Africa (8.2%) were the most common places of birth for the 24.1% of the residents who were born abroad—which was an average percentage for Los Angeles as a whole.

===Neighborhoods===
Of several entrances, there are two main ones: (1) the East Gate at Beverly Glen and Sunset Boulevards and (2) the West Gate at Bellagio Way and Sunset Boulevard, opposite an entrance to UCLA. Bel Air is generally subdivided into three distinct neighborhoods: East Gate Old Bel Air, West Gate Bel Air, and Upper Bel Air.

Bel Air Estates, the original subdivision of the Bel Air community, is generally bounded by Nimes Road to the north, Sunset Boulevard to the south, Beverly Glen Boulevard to the east and both sides of Bel Air Road to the west.

==Attractions==
The Hannah Carter Japanese Garden is located in Bel Air. It was inspired by the gardens of Kyoto. Many structures in the garden—the main gate, garden house, bridges, and shrine—were built in Japan and reassembled on site. Antique stone carvings, water basins and lanterns, as well as the five-tiered pagoda, and key symbolic rocks are also from Japan.

==Government and infrastructure==
The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services SPA 5 West Area Health Office serves Bel Air.

It lies within the 5th city council district, represented by Katy Young Yaroslavsky. It is located in the 90077 (Bel Air Estates &amp; Beverly Glen) ZIP code, which is part of the city of Los Angeles. Stone Canyon Reservoir lies in the northeastern part of Bel Air. Established in 1994, it serves around 500,000 people. The Bel Air Association has been operational since 1942, dedicated to preserving the aesthetic appearance of the residential community.

==Education==

Almost two-thirds (66.1%) of Bel Air residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, a high percentage for the city and the county. The percentages of residents in that age range with a bachelor&#x27;s degree or greater were high for the county. The community is within the Los Angeles Unified School District. The area is within Board District 4. As of 2009, Steve Zimmer represented the district.

===Schools===
The schools within Bel Air are as follows:

====Public====
* Roscomare Road Elementary School, 2425 Roscomare Road
* Community Magnet Charter Elementary School, 11301 Bellagio Road. , because the school&#x27;s points-based admissions system does not favor area residents, children living in Bel Air generally do not attend the school. It is located in the former Bellagio Road School campus.

Roscomare Road and Warner Avenue Elementary School in Westwood are the zoned elementary schools serving Bel Air.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT 2005/mar/06&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Bel Air is within the attendance boundaries of Emerson Middle School in Westwood and University High School, West Los Angeles.

In April 1983, an advisory committee of the LAUSD recommended closing eight LAUSD schools, including Bellagio Road School. The committee did not target Fairburn Avenue School in Westwood, as a way of allowing it to preserve its ethnic balance, and so it can take children from Bellagio Road in case it closed. In August 1983, the board publicly considered closing Bellagio, which had 240 students at the time. The school&#x27;s enrollment had been decreasing. In May 1983 the board voted to keep the school open. In February 1984, after the composition of the board had changed, the board voted to close the Bellagio Road School.

Bel Air previously housed the Bellagio Road Newcomer School, a 3rd–8th grade school for newly arrived immigrants. In 2002, it had 390 students from Armenia, China, El Salvador, Guatemala, Korea, Russia, and other countries. This program was housed in the former Bellagio Road school.

====Private====
* Marymount High School, 10643 Sunset Boulevard
* Stephen S. Wise Temple Elementary School/Milken Community Schools, K–12, 15500 Stephen S. Wise Drive
* John Thomas Dye School, K–6, 11414 Chalon Road
* The Mirman School
* Westland School, 16200 Mulholland Drive, was founded in 1949. It moved to its current location in 1965, becoming the first school to locate in what has now developed into a major &#x27;institutional corridor&#x27; in the area of the Sepulveda Pass.

====University====
Bel Air is home to the American Jewish University. Additionally, Bel Air borders the University of California, Los Angeles on the south.

==In popular culture==
Television shows and films have been filmed in Bel Air, or are said to take place in the community. Exterior shots for the &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot; were shot in and around 750 Bel Air Road, built by Lynn Atkinson (and later sold to hotelier Arnold Kirkeby after Atkinson&#x27;s wife refused to move into a house she thought too ).
Several scenes in the film &quot;Get Hard&quot; (2015) were set in Bel Air.
Exterior scenes from films such as &quot;Get Shorty&quot; (1995) have also been filmed in the area. Several episodes of the television show &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; were filmed in Bel Air.

The television sitcom &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, starring actor and rapper Will Smith, was set in the neighborhood, although the exterior shots used were filmed in nearby Brentwood.

The Bel Air house featured in the film &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot; (1960) was built and completed during filming, and still stands today as a private residence.

The Bel Air Film Festival, first held in 2008, is an annual international film festival held in Bel Air and the Los Angeles area.

<text>Take the High Road (renamed High Road from 1994 to 2003) was a British soap opera produced by Scottish Television, which started in February 1980 as an ITV daytime programme, and was broadcast until 2003. It was set in the fictional village of Glendarroch, Scotland, with exteriors filmed in the village of Luss on the banks of Loch Lomond.

The series was dropped by most ITV stations in the 1990s, while Scottish, Grampian, Border and Ulster stations continued to screen it until its last episode. From April 2020, the entire series was made available to stream to UK viewers on the STV Player app.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1979, the ITV network decided its daytime schedule would be improved by the inclusion of a soap opera set in Scotland. At the time the only soap opera being made by any of the three Scottish regional companies was Scottish Television&#x27;s &quot;Garnock Way&quot;, set in a Central Belt mining community between Glasgow and Edinburgh. It had been running in Scotland for three years but was dropped for a new concept to feature a more picturesque view of rural Scotland, with &quot;lots of lochs and hills&quot;. It was decided its replacement should focus on a highland estate community, comprising a village and several farms. As Michael Elder puts it, the series would have a scenic backdrop against which the everyday events would be set.

As the original name for the setting was &#x27;Glendhu&#x27; and focussed on the role of its estate manager, known in Scotland as a factor, the proposed title was &quot;The Glendhu Factor&quot;. The network disliked the village name and rejected the title, thinking its meaning was unclear. As a result, the setting was renamed &#x27;Glendarroch&#x27;. Once the village of Luss on the western shore of Loch Lomond was proposed as a filming location, the title &quot;Take the High Road&quot; was suggested by the folk song about the area, &quot;The Bonnie Banks o&#x27; Loch Lomond&quot; which contains the line &quot;O ye&#x27;ll tak&#x27; the high road, and I&#x27;ll tak&#x27; the low road&quot;.

Production began in late 1979 once &quot;Garnock Way&quot; was axed.

===Links to &quot;Garnock Way&quot;===
Producers sought to keep the audience of &quot;Garnock Way&quot; by featuring some of its key cast members in &quot;Take the High Road&quot; and suggesting continuity by having a character, Todd the garage mechanic, played by Bill Henderson, leave Garnock Way to set up business in the highlands. As a direct cross-over was not possible a similar character with the same origin story was created and played by the same actor in &quot;Take the High Road&quot;.

===Production and changes===
The main writer was series creator Don Houghton with many early scripts written by actor Michael Elder, who played Dr Wallace in the show. Until 1986, the series broadcast for 40 weeks of the year, with a break in the first quarter of the year. Themes broadly reflected a nostalgic view of Scottish highland culture through relationships between crofters and villagers, the gentry and an estate manager (or &#x27;factor&#x27;). Dramatic use was made of the external threats of commercialisation, tourism and redevelopment. Historically one family had owned the estate, the village and neighbouring crofts and farms. The series begins with their struggle to resist plans to convert Glendarroch into a leisure resort for wealthy tourists. In 2005, this scenario was echoed when Donald Trump bought and decimated an Aberdeenshire estate to build a controversial golf resort.

In March 1990, the series was revamped to appeal to a younger audience which jarred with the sense of authenticity of a Scottish village. Within six months, the changes were considered successful and enabled stronger story lines and the introduction of new characters.

&quot;Take the High Road&quot; was the only soap for the ITV network which was not made by one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; companies. This helped to give Scotland an identity on the network and also provide sufficient revenue to help STV to produce more programmes for ITV and Channel 4.

===Dropped by the ITV network===
When ITV reviewed all long-standing series made by ITV companies in 1993, it became apparent regions outside of Scotland were months behind in their transmissions, suggesting a lower demand. On 2 June 1993, Marcus Plantin, ITV&#x27;s network director, announced &quot;Take the High Road&quot; would be dropped from English schedules from September 1993, as &#x27;ITV&#x27;s statisticians believed English audiences have had enough&#x27;. This resulted in public protest, as many believed that without the support of English ITV companies, the Scottish series had no future. The issue was raised in parliament under early day motions, and the &quot;Daily Record&quot; held a protest.

By the end of June, Scottish Television resolved to continue producing the series regardless and it was reclassified as a product other ITV networks could purchase as a cheaper rate. To cut costs, the number of episodes was cut and the cast took a reduction in salaries. When English viewers campaigned to their local broadcasters to keep the series nearly all ITV companies agreed, except Carlton, Central, Tyne Tees and Yorkshire, who ceased transmitting it from 7 September 1993. Subsequently, popular demand forced Carlton to reinstate the series from 16 October 1993, and Central from 5 November 1993. The two companies that initially declined to reinstate the series, Tyne Tees Television and Yorkshire Television, eventually brought it back in early 1996, screening it from where they left off.

On 22 July 1994 the series&#x27; name was permanently shortened to &quot;High Road&quot;, the name viewers knew it by colloquially.

From 1995 the number of ITV areas broadcasting the soap gradually reduced; however, some did complete the series:

* Anglia and Meridian until Christmas 1995.
* Yorkshire, Tyne Tees, HTV and Granada until Christmas 1997 
* Carlton until Christmas 1998.
* Central and Westcountry until Friday 24 May 2002.
* Border completed the series in 2003.
* UTV completed the series in 2004.

By October 2000 Scottish Television had run up a larger stockpile of episodes, with many believing the series was about to get axed. In April 2001 STV announced high road would be reviewed in 2002 as part programme review The last episode of the series was screened in April 2003.

==Theme tune==

The original theme was written by composer Arthur Blake, STV&#x27;s Musical Director. The first instrumental version was recorded by Silly Wizard and used until 1982 reflected the Scottish folk themes. This was replaced by an orchestral version from Episode 127 on August 1982 until episode 334 in 1985. Instruments featured included the oboe, clarinet, violin, and drum kit. While this version was in use, the music for the break strings tended to vary from episode to episode. Like the Silly Wizard version, the music for the closing credits also featured a drum roll introduction.

The third version was a different orchestral arrangement and was used from episode 335 in 1986 until episode 727 at the beginning of 1990. This new orchestral version was more violin led than the former, which had made more use of wind instruments, and featured no percussion.

From episode 728 in 1990, the fourth, rock-style, version made its debut and continued to be used until the end of the series. This version was electric guitar led (played by session guitarist Duncan Finlay) and featured percussion during the &quot;middle&quot; section. From 1994 when the programme name was shortened to High Road, the length of the closing credits was cut, so the closing theme was faded in just before the middle eight.

==Cast and characters==
==Broadcasting==
===STV series===
Dates are for Scottish Television, which on some occasions was ahead of the ITV network daytime showing. 
* Series 1: 19 February 1980 – 28 May 1980: episodes 1–30
* Series 2: 14 October 1980 – 7 January 1981: episodes 31–56

From February 1987 onward, the series was broadcast all year round twice a week. In May 1993 the series became weekly, due to the fact that English stations were 20 episodes behind. Later in the run, however, there were several gaps during which the series was not shown, although the storylines continued uninterrupted each time the series resumed. The gaps were from 12 September to 22 October 2000; from 16 April to 12 May 2001; from June to August 2001; from 24 September to 27 October 2001; from 18 February to 6 April 2002; from June to September 2002; and in February 2003.

===Regional scheduling===
&quot;Take the High Road&quot; was broadcast by all ITV companies when it started in 1980. Nearly all regions broadcast &quot;Take the High Road&quot; during the daytime, except for Scottish Television who broadcast the soap in the early evenings around 7.00pm, instead of &quot;Emmerdale&quot;. From 1984 Border Television moved the series to a peak-time slot. Grampian Television did the same too in September 1987.

===International===
&quot;Take the High Road&quot; was broadcast in a number of countries around the world, including Canada, the United States and New Zealand. In Australia, it was broadcast on ABC1. In Ireland, the series was shown five days a week from the beginning on RTÉ One. As episodes caught up with the UK transmissions, the number of broadcasts were reduced.

===Repeats===
&quot;Take the High Road&quot; was repeated on Sky Soap; the episodes shown in early 1997 were from the beginning, and 1989 episodes were being shown when the channel ended in April 1999. Early episodes from about 1994–95 were shown on Sky Scottish in 1997/98. It was repeated briefly on Life One from February 2008. This channel began with episode 1000 from 1992 but it ceased broadcasting after only six weeks having shown only four episodes.

In the autumn of 2010, STV added nearly every episode to its YouTube channel, making the series accessible to viewers across the world. It was removed once it began repeating on STV&#x27;s new local channel, STV Glasgow from 3 June 2014, broadcasting one episode each weekday, with an omnibus at the weekends. The series was also shown on STV Edinburgh from its launch in January 2015. When STV Glasgow &amp; STV Edinburgh were renamed STV2, the series was moved to a Saturday morning between 9am and 11am until June 2018, when the STV2 channel closed down. STV continued to make the series available online via the STV Player, from the same point where STV2 left off. Five episodes were uploaded every week from 8 July 2018 on Sundays. From 14 September 2019 this increased to five episodes each Saturday and five episodes each Sunday. This run ended after the final episodes were uploaded on 18 April 2020.

====Current availability====
Starting on 26 April 2020, STV began a complete rerun of by loading five episodes per week onto their STV Player app. They are free to UK viewers. Each block of five episodes remains available for six months, with the first five removed on 23 October 2020 and so on. UK viewers can access the available episodes on mobile media by registering with STV Player and can watch them on television by linking their membership to the STV Freeview function.

As of 15 July 2021, a few selected episodes from the series are available on BritBox, a subscription only service curated by the BBC and ITV.

==Sponsorship==
During its network transmission &quot;Take the High Road&quot; was sponsored by Brooke Bond and Scottish Blend tea from the beginning of 1992 until 1995 and Mother&#x27;s Pride from August 1999 to September 2001 on Scottish and Grampian TV. The STV Player rerun has been sponsored by Tunnock&#x27;s bakery, McDonald&#x27;s, and ScotRail, among others.

==Media==

===DVD releases===
&quot;Take the High Road&quot; became available for the first time ever when distribution company Go Entertain commenced releasing the series in 2012 on DVD.

Rights to the series were later acquired by Alba Home Entertainment in 2013, with sets released in the same format, with the exception of each set now available with one disc. The series ceased releasing in 2014 after 16 volumes and 96 episodes, possibly due to poor sales. It is currently unknown if any future sets will become available.

In an unusual occurrence, the series was not rated by the BBFC for home video release, which is normally the case for all television series and films. It received an &#x27;E&#x27; (Exempt from classification) rating, an unofficial rating only applied to documentaries or sports events released on home video.

==Theme tune==

The theme tune was written by composer Arthur Blake, who was STV&#x27;s Musical Director at the time, and there were four versions of it over the 23-year run. The first version was performed by Silly Wizard and was used until 1982. This version was quite &quot;Scottish folk band&quot; in style and pretty lively. Instruments featured included the accordion, banjo, drum kit, and synthesiser. The music for the closing credits featured a drum roll introduction. Silly Wizard performed another version which was released on record in 1980.

The &quot;Silly Wizard&quot; theme tune was replaced by an orchestral version from Esp 127 on 24 August 1982. The orchestral version was used from 1982 until episode 334 in 1985. Instruments featured included the oboe, clarinet, violin, and drum kit. While this version was in use, the music for the break strings tended to vary from episode to episode. Like the Silly Wizard version, the music for the closing credits also featured a drum roll introduction.

The third version was a different orchestral arrangement and was used from episode 335 in 1986 until episode 727 at the beginning of 1990. This new orchestral version was more violin led than the former, which had made more use of wind instruments, and featured no percussion.

From episode 728 in 1990, the fourth, rock-style, version made its debut and continued to be used until the end of the series. This version was electric guitar led (played by session guitarist Duncan Finlay) and featured percussion during the &quot;middle&quot; section. From 1994 when the programme name was shortened to High Road, the length of the closing credits was cut, so the closing theme was faded in just before the middle eight.

<text>Telstar 1 is a defunct communications satellite launched by NASA on July 10, 1962. One of the earliest communications satellites, it was the first satellite to achieve live transmission of broadcast television images between the United States and Europe. Telstar 1 remained active for only 7 months before it prematurely failed due to Starfish Prime, a high-altitude nuclear test conducted by the United States. Although the satellite is no longer operational, it remains in Earth orbit.

==History==

The idea of relaying information from one point on Earth to another by means of satellites was not new. As early as October 1945, the visionary Arthur C. Clarke published an article talking about it in the specialized magazine &quot;Wireless World&quot;. His idea was to enable communication between two points which were prevented from direct radio communication by the curve of the Earth, by relaying the information by radio through an orbiting satellite. During the Cold War, the shock caused by the successful launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, by the Soviets increased the United States&#x27; interest in aerospace research. Soon thereafter, the Americans began their attempts to launch orbital communications satellites for transmitting telephone, radio, and television signals.

In December 1958, the United States successfully launched its first communications satellite, SCORE. Through it, then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent a Christmas message to the entire world. However, SCORE stayed in orbit for only a few months, its enormous surface area and very low Earth orbit forcing reentry after only 500 laps around the planet due to aerodynamic resistance. Also, SCORE relied on a passive reflector, which greatly reduced signal strength, since it did not amplify the signal before sending it back to earth.

The Telstar project represented a substantial financial investment to advance satellite communications technology. According to a memorandum dated August 16, 1962, the total expenditure for the Telstar experimental satellite project, as reported by AT&amp;T to Senator Kerr, was approximately $50 million. This figure includes an initial estimate of $45 million as of April 19, 1962, covering the costs of orbiting the Telstar satellite and establishing a fully operational ground station in Andover, Maine. Additional expenses incurred after this date increased the total project costs by $5 million, with the Andover facility alone costing around $10 million and another $4 million for necessary tie-in lines.

AT&amp;T also reported that it had invested $1.4 billion in research and development for the essential components of the communications system, of which over $1 billion was directed towards technology closely related to satellite communications.

Specific launch costs were also covered by AT&amp;T. On February 16, 1962, approximately five months before the July 10, 1962, launch, AT&amp;T made an advance payment to NASA totaling $2,680,982.

==Launch==

Telstar 1 was launched on July 10, 1962, from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, atop a Delta rocket. Spherical in shape, the satellite had a diameter of and weighed .

==Operations==
The satellite had a transponder (receiver and transmitter) with a 50 MHz bandwidth that could relay a single television channel or a FDM signal containing multiple telephone calls or datastreams. The two rings of microwave cavities visible around the satellite&#x27;s middle were the uplink and downlink antennas for the data signal. The satellite received the 6.39 GHz microwave uplink signal from the transmitting ground station through the upper ring of smaller cavities, and transmitted the 4.17 GHz downlink signal back to the receiving ground station through the lower ring of larger cavities. Since the transmitter was very weak, with a radiated power of only 14 watts, and the antenna array was omnidirectional, very large aperture antennas were required at the ground stations to communicate with it. The satellite also had a helical antenna at one end to receive control commands. 
A 53-meter terrestrial antenna manufactured by AT&amp;T Corporation, located in Andover, Maine, was used for the transmissions between the United States and Europe. Built in 1961, and used by Telstar 1, it was later used by Relay 1. Telstar 1 operated normally from launch until November 1962 when the radiation from the Starfish Prime detonation affected the command channel, which began to behave erratically. The satellite was continuously switched on to work around this problem. On November 23, 1962, the command channel stopped responding. On December 20, the satellite was successfully reactivated, and intermittent data were obtained until February 21, 1963, when the transmitter failed. The energy used by it was produced by 3,600 solar cells. The satellite relied on an active repeater and magnified signal strength by a factor of a hundred using a travelling wave tube amplifier (TWTA). Thirteen days after the launch, the first live broadcast of a television show between the United States and Europe took place.

<text>Phobos 1 was an uncrewed Soviet space probe of the Phobos Program launched from the Baikonour launch facility on 7 July 1988. Its intended mission was to explore Mars and its moons Phobos and Deimos. The mission failed on 2 September 1988 when a computer malfunction caused the end-of-mission order to be transmitted to the spacecraft. At the time of launch it was the heaviest interplanetary spacecraft ever launched, weighing .

==Background==

The intent to carry out a mission with Phobos as the target was first made public 14 November 1984. Phobos was chosen as the target in order to avoid directly competing with previous American missions. Originally a 1986 launch was planned but this later moved to 1988.

== Flight plan ==
It was to take an estimated 200 days for the &quot;Phobos 1&quot; space probe to travel from the Earth to Mars. Two mid-course corrections were planned, the first between days 7 and 20, and the second between days 185 and 193. These corrections would place the probe in a highly elliptical orbit around Mars. Next, it was to move into an almost circular observation orbit at 350 km. After achieving observation orbit the lower stage of the propulsion system would be dropped. The probe would then rendezvous with Phobos, drop a lander containing scientific equipment from an altitude of 50 meters, and move into a final equatorial orbit above Mars where it would study the Martian surface and atmosphere.

== Mission objectives ==
The &quot;Phobos 1&quot; probe&#x27;s scientific study was separated into three phases. In stage one the probe would investigate the Sun and interplanetary space while traveling from the Earth to Mars. In stage two the probe would study Mars and Phobos while in orbit around Mars. During the final stage it would approach to within 50 meters of the Phobos surface while conducting several experiments.

== Experiments ==
The Phobos probe carried several scientific experiments. It carried a radar transmitter, X-ray and alpha-backscatter spectrometers, camera, and a laser that could vaporize tiny spots so a reflector could analyze the vapor for atomic masses.

The probe also carried a . The hopper would be dropped onto Phobos to drill and analyze the soil. It would be able to bounce across the terrain by using spring loaded legs.

==Mission profile==

The optical coronagraph that was part of the Terek experiment and designed to observe the Sun was non-functional from launch.

=== Malfunction ===
On 2 September 1988, the expected transmission from &quot;Phobos 1&quot; was not received. This was traced to a faulty key-command that was sent on 28 August from ground control in Yevpatoria. Same as the case of Mariner 1, a technician unintentionally left out a single hyphen in one of the keyed commands. All commands were supposed to be proofread by a computer before being transmitted, but the computer that checked code was malfunctioning. The technician violated procedure and transmitted the command before the computer could be fixed to proofread it. This minor alteration in code deactivated the attitude thrusters. By losing its lock on the Sun, the spacecraft could no longer properly orient its solar arrays, thus depleting its batteries.

Software instructions to turn off the probe&#x27;s attitude control, normally a fatal operation, were part of a routine used when testing the spacecraft on the ground. Normally this routine would be removed before launch. However, the software was coded in PROMs, and so removing the test code would have required removing and replacing the entire computer. Because of time pressure from the impending launch, engineers decided to leave the command sequence in, though it should never be used. However, a single-character error in constructing an upload sequence resulted in the command executing, with subsequent loss of the spacecraft.

The error is also attributed to a political argument between Yevpatoria and Moscow over who should control the mission. Moscow won control responsibility, but Yevpatoria would be responsible for checking all transmitted commands. This further complicated the process of transmitting valid commands to the spacecraft.

== Subsequent investigation ==
After the incident at Yevpatoria, an investigation was immediately ordered to determine who was responsible for the failure. Nevertheless, disciplinary action was postponed until the completion of the &quot;Phobos 2&quot; mission. This was to prevent the demoralization of the &quot;Phobos 2&quot; team. Any penalization of the &quot;Phobos 1&quot; team would create anxiety among the &quot;Phobos 2&quot; team and reduce the chances of mission success. This postponement of punitive measures was urged by IKI director Roald Sagdeev. He quoted the former secret-service chief under Stalin, Lavrenti Beria, who said, &quot;Let&#x27;s make them work for now. We can shoot them all later.&quot; The investigation concluded with the dismissal of the ground control commander at Yevpatoria and the acknowledgement that the computer system was poorly designed.

==Results==
The probe observed the Sun in both X-rays (0.5–2.5 nm) and extreme ultraviolet (17–18 nm). On 27 August a solar flare was observed.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Phobos 1&quot; failed before it could achieve its main scientific objectives, and while the Phobos program as a whole can be considered a failure, the probes discovered previously unknown information concerning Mars and Phobos during their lengthy orbital flights. In 1988, less was known about Mars and its satellites than the more distant gas giants.

<text>Phobos 2 was the last space probe designed by the Soviet Union. It was designed to explore the moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos. It was launched on 12 July 1988, and entered orbit on 29 January 1989.

&quot;Phobos 2&quot; operated nominally throughout its cruise and Mars orbital insertion phase on 29 January 1989, gathering data on the Sun, interplanetary medium, Mars, and Phobos. &quot;Phobos 2&quot; investigated the Mars surface and atmosphere and returned 37 images of Phobos with a resolution of up to 40 meters.

Shortly before the final phase of the mission, during which the spacecraft was to approach within of Phobos&#x27; surface and release two landers (one, a mobile , the other, a stationary platform) contact with &quot;Phobos 2&quot; was lost. The mission ended when the spacecraft signal failed to be reacquired on 27 March 1989. The cause of the failure was determined to be a malfunction of the on-board computer.

==Background==
The mission to Phobos was announced on 14 November 1984. Phobos was chosen as the target in order to avoid direct competition with previous American missions. The original 1986 launch plan was later moved to 1988.

==Mission profile==
Phobos 2 started to develop problems during the interplanetary flight phase of the mission. By the time the probe reached Mars orbit, two of its three computers were malfunctioning. One computer was completely dead, and a second was starting to fail. Since the probe depended on two computers to agree on any decision, the one healthy computer would not be able to control the craft because it could not outvote two bad computers. The craft&#x27;s high speed transmitter had also developed issues.

Phobos 2 successfully carried out three preliminary encounters with Phobos by using its Videospectrometric Camera, the Combined Radiometer and Photometer for Mars and the Imaging Spectrometer for Mars.

==Spacecraft design==
===Instruments===

The &quot;Phobos 2&quot; infrared spectrometer (ISM) obtained 45000 spectra in the near infrared (from ) in the equatorial areas of Mars, with a spatial resolution ranging from , and 400 spectra of Phobos at 700 m resolution. These observations made it possible to generate the first mineralogical maps of the planet and its satellite, and to study the atmosphere of Mars. ISM was developed at IAS and DESPA (Paris Observatory) with support from CNES.

* Lima-D laser experiment - designed to vaporize material from the Phobos surface for chemical analysis by a mass spectrometer
* Automatic Space Plasma Experiment with Rotating Analyzer (ASPERA), an electron spectrometer and ion mass analyzer from the Swedish Institute of Space Physics.

==Results==
The craft took 37 photos of Phobos imaging the majority (80%) of the moon. The infrared spectrometer found no sign of water.

==Legacy==
The Phobos design was used again for the long delayed &quot;Mars 96&quot; mission which ended in failure when the launch vehicle&#x27;s fourth stage misfired. In addition, the &quot;Fobos-Grunt&quot; mission, also designed to explore Phobos, failed in 2011. There has yet to be a completely successful probe to Phobos.

<doc id="425270" wikidata="Q962605" url="?curid=425270" title="Mulholland Drive">
<text>Mulholland Drive is a street and road in the eastern Santa Monica Mountains of Southern California. It is named after pioneering Los Angeles civil engineer William Mulholland. The western rural portion in Los Angeles and Ventura counties is named Mulholland Highway. The road is featured in a significant number of films, songs, and novels. David Lynch, who wrote and directed a film named after Mulholland Drive, has said that one can feel &quot;the history of Hollywood&quot; on it. Jack Nicholson has lived on Mulholland Drive for many years, and still did so .

==History==
The main portion of the road, from Cahuenga Pass in Hollywood westward past Sepulveda Pass, was originally called Mulholland Highway and was opened in 1924. It was built by a consortium of developers investing in the Hollywood Hills. DeWitt Reaburn, the construction engineer responsible for the project, said while it was being built, &quot;The Mulholland Highway is destined to be one of the heaviest traveled and one of the best known scenic roads in the United States.&quot;

The street has experienced multiple closures throughout the years due to mudslides and storm damage, with the latest one being in 2024. 

==Geography==

The long mostly two-lane, minor arterial road loosely follows the ridgeline of the eastern Santa Monica Mountains and the Hollywood Hills, connecting two sections of U.S. Route 101, and crossing Sepulveda Boulevard, Beverly Glen Boulevard, Coldwater Canyon Avenue, Laurel Canyon Boulevard, Nichols Canyon Road, and Outpost Drive.

The road offers views of the Los Angeles Basin, the San Fernando Valley, Downtown Los Angeles and the Hollywood Sign.

Mulholland Drive has some of the most exclusive and expensive homes in the world, housing mainly Hollywood celebrities.

==Route==
The eastern terminus of Mulholland Drive is at its intersection with Cahuenga Boulevard at the Cahuenga Pass over the Santa Monica Mountains (at this point Cahuenga Boulevard runs adjacent to Highway 101/The Hollywood Freeway). The road continues to the west, offering vistas of the Hollywood Sign, Downtown Los Angeles, and then Burbank, Universal City, and the rest of the San Fernando Valley with the San Gabriel, Verdugo, and Santa Susana Mountains.

The road winds along the top of the mountains until a few miles west of the San Diego/Interstate 405 Freeway. Just west of the intersection with Encino Hills Drive, it becomes an unpaved road not open to motor vehicles. This part is known by many as &quot;Dirt Mulholland&quot;. This portion connects with other unpaved roads and bike trails and allows access to a decommissioned Project Nike command post that is now a Cold War memorial park. (This portion of Mulholland Drive was open to through traffic as late as the 1990s before being permanently closed to motor vehicles so that they would no longer interfere with the natural beauty and wilderness of the area.)

The road opens again east of Topanga Canyon Boulevard (State Route 27) at Santa Maria Road but remains dirt until it reaches Saltillo Street. Shortly thereafter, the thoroughfare splits into Mulholland Drive and Mulholland Highway. Mulholland Drive terminates at U.S. Highway 101 (the Ventura Freeway), where it becomes Valley Circle Boulevard. Mulholland Highway continues to the southwest until it terminates at State Route 1 (PCH) in Leo Carrillo State Park at the Pacific Ocean coast and the border of Los Angeles and Ventura counties.

<text>George Ryoichi Ariyoshi (, born March 12, 1926) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the third governor of Hawaii from 1974 to 1986. A Democrat, he is Hawaii&#x27;s longest-serving governor and the first American of Asian descent to serve as governor of a U.S. state. He assumed gubernatorial powers and duties when Governor John A. Burns was declared incapacitated in October 1973 and was elected in 1974 (assuming governorship December 1974), becoming the first Asian-American to be elected governor of a U.S. state or territory. His lengthy tenure is a record likely to remain unbroken due to term limits enacted after he left office. Since the death of former U.S. president Jimmy Carter in December 2024, he is the oldest living former governor of any U.S. state.

==Early life==
Ariyoshi was born in Honolulu, then in the Territory of Hawaii, to Japanese immigrant parents, who named him after George Washington. Ariyoshi graduated in 1944 from McKinley High School. As World War II drew to a close, he served as an interpreter with the U.S. Army Military Intelligence Service in Japan. Upon returning stateside, he first attended the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, then transferred to Michigan State University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1949. He then went on to receive his J.D. degree from the University of Michigan Law School in 1952.

==Political career==
Ariyoshi&#x27;s political career began in 1954 when he was elected to the Hawaii Territorial House of Representatives. He was later elected to the Hawaii Territorial Senate in 1958, then to the Hawaii State Senate in 1959. He served in the senate until 1970 when he ran for and was elected lieutenant governor of Hawaii in 1970 with Governor John A. Burns. When Governor Burns fell ill in October 1973, Ariyoshi assumed his constitutional role as acting governor.

==Governor==

In the election of 1974, Ariyoshi was elected governor in his own right, with Nelson Doi as his lieutenant governor. He was re-elected in 1978 with Jean King as lieutenant governor and in 1982 with John D. Waihee III as lieutenant governor. Ariyoshi&#x27;s administration was marked by fiscal conservatism as the post-statehood economic boom came to an end. He guided the state through its first economic recession. Barred by term limits from seeking another term in 1986, Ariyoshi was succeeded by Waihee. After leaving public office, he served in a variety of corporate and non-profit capacities.

==Personal life==

Ariyoshi married Jean Miya Hayashi in 1955 in Honolulu, Hawaii. They have a daughter, Lynn, born in 1957; and two sons, Ryozo, born in 1959, and Donn, 1961.

In her book &quot;Washington Place: A First Lady&#x27;s Story&quot;, Jean Ariyoshi credits former police officer Larry Mehau as becoming responsible for her family&#x27;s safety. Mehau was also named &quot;Neighbor Islands Coordinator&quot; for her husband&#x27;s campaign for governor. In the book she states that Mehau, although having a reputation as being honest and tough, was nicknamed in the press as &quot;the Godfather&quot;. She does not mention why he was given this nickname, but the press did so because he was accused of having ties to the criminal underworld, many claiming that he was the top boss of organized crime in Hawai&#x27;i. According to Jean Ariyoshi, Mehau offered his help but told her husband: &quot;I know I&#x27;m controversial, so don&#x27;t put me up in front.&quot; Her husband responded: &quot;I&#x27;ve known you for a long time and I&#x27;ve known you to be a good and honest person. What kind of friend would I be if I said &#x27;I want your help but I don&#x27;t want anyone to know you&#x27;re helping me?&#x27; I&#x27;m not afraid to have people know of our friendship.&quot; In his own 200-page autobiography, &quot;With Obligation to All&quot;, George Ariyoshi does not mention Larry Mehau at all.

Ariyoshi has also served as president of the Hawaii Bar Association and served on the board of directors for First Hawaiian Bank, the Honolulu Gas Company and Hawaiian Insurance Guaranty Company. He also served on the board of governors at the East-West Center, based in Honolulu, an internationally known education and research organization that was established by U.S. Congress. As governor, he is credited with revitalizing the organization, and joined the board when his term as governor ended. He served five terms as chairman, until he was not reappointed by Republican governor Linda Lingle in 2003.

<doc id="425279" wikidata="Q29071" url="?curid=425279" title="Containment">
<text>Containment was a geopolitical strategic foreign policy pursued by the United States during the Cold War to prevent the spread of communism after the end of World War II. The name was loosely related to the term &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;, which was containment of the Soviet Union in the interwar period.

Containment represented a middle-ground position between détente (relaxation of relations) and rollback (actively replacing a regime). The basis of the doctrine was articulated in a 1946 cable by U.S. diplomat George F. Kennan during the post-World War II term of U.S. President Harry S. Truman. As a description of U.S. foreign policy, the word originated in a report Kennan submitted to US Defense Secretary James Forrestal in 1947, which was later used in a &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; article.

In a broader context, the term is employed to denote a strategy designed to limit or hinder an opponent&#x27;s capacity for international power projection. China used this term to characterize the United States&#x27; efforts to impede its global ascent.

==Earlier uses of term==
Both Americans and Europeans were aware of significant historical antecedents. In the 1850s, anti-slavery forces in the United States developed a free soil strategy of containment to stop the expansion of slavery until it later collapsed. Historian James Oakes explains the strategy:
Between 1873 and 1877, Germany repeatedly intervened in the internal affairs of France&#x27;s neighbors. In Belgium, Spain, and Italy, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck exerted strong and sustained political pressure to support the election or appointment of liberal, anticlerical governments. That was part of an integrated strategy to promote republicanism in France by strategically and ideologically isolating the clerical-monarchist regime of President Patrice de MacMahon. It was hoped that by surrounding France with a number of liberal states, French Republicans could defeat MacMahon and his reactionary supporters. The modern concept of containment provides a useful model for understanding the dynamics of this policy.

After the 1917 October Revolution in Russia, there were calls by Western leaders to isolate the Bolshevik government, which seemed intent on promoting worldwide revolution. In March 1919, French Premier Georges Clemenceau called for a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;, a ring of non-communist states, to isolate Soviet Russia. Translating that phrase, US President Woodrow Wilson called for a &quot;quarantine.&quot;

The World War I allies launched an incursion into Russia, as after the Bolshevik Revolution, Vladimir Lenin withdrew the country from the First World War, allowing Germany to reallocate troops to face the Allied forces on the Western Front. Concurrently, President Wilson became increasingly aware of the human rights violations perpetuated by the new Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and opposed the new regime&#x27;s militant atheism and advocacy of a command economy. He also was concerned that Marxism–Leninism would spread to the remainder of the Western world, and intended his landmark Fourteen Points partially to provide liberal democracy as an alternative worldwide ideology to Communism. Despite reservations, the United States, as a result of the fear of Japanese expansion into Russian-held territory and their support for the Allied-aligned Czech Legion, sent a small number of troops to Northern Russia and Siberia. The United States also provided indirect aid such as food and supplies to the White Army. The incursion was unpopular at home and lacked a cohesive strategy, leading the allies to ultimately withdraw from Russia.

The U.S. initially refused to recognize the Soviet Union, but President Franklin D. Roosevelt reversed the policy in 1933 in the hope to expand American export markets.

The Munich Agreement of 1938 was a failed attempt to contain Nazi expansion in Europe. The U.S. tried to contain Japanese expansion in Asia from 1937 to 1941, and Japan reacted with its attack on Pearl Harbor.

After Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 during World War II, the U.S. and the Soviet Union found themselves allied against Germany and used rollback to defeat the Axis powers: Germany, Italy, and Japan.

==Origin (1944–1947)==

Key State Department personnel grew increasingly frustrated with and suspicious of the Soviets as the war drew to a close. Averell Harriman, U.S. Ambassador in Moscow, once a &quot;confirmed optimist&quot; regarding U.S.–Soviet relations, was disillusioned by what he saw as the Soviet betrayal of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising as well as by violations of the February 1945 Yalta Agreement concerning Poland. Harriman would later have a significant influence in forming Truman&#x27;s views on the Soviet Union.

In February 1946, the U.S. State Department asked George F. Kennan, then at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, why the Russians opposed the creation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. He responded with a wide-ranging analysis of Russian policy now called the &quot;Long Telegram&quot;:

Kennan&#x27;s cable was hailed in the State Department as &quot;the appreciation of the situation that had long been needed.&quot; Kennan himself attributed the enthusiastic reception to timing: &quot;Six months earlier the message would probably have been received in the State Department with raised eyebrows and lips pursed in disapproval. Six months later, it would probably have sounded redundant.&quot; Clark Clifford and George Elsey produced a report elaborating on the &quot;Long Telegram&quot; and proposing concrete policy recommendations based on its analysis. This report, which recommended &quot;restraining and confining&quot; Soviet influence, was presented to Truman on September 24, 1946.

In January 1947, Kennan drafted an essay entitled &quot;The Sources of Soviet Conduct.&quot; Navy Secretary James Forrestal gave permission for the report to be published in the journal &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;X.&quot; Biographer Douglas Brinkley has dubbed Forrestal &quot;godfather of containment&quot; on account of his work in distributing Kennan&#x27;s writing. The use of the word &quot;containment&quot; originates from this so-called &quot;X Article&quot;: &quot;In these circumstances, it is clear that the main element of any United States policy toward the Soviet Union must be that of long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies.&quot;

Kennan later turned against the containment policy and noted several deficiencies in his X Article. He later said that by containment he meant not the containment of Soviet Power &quot;by military means of a military threat, but the political containment of a political threat.&quot; Second, Kennan admitted a failure in the article to specify the geographical scope of &quot;containment&quot;, and that containment was not something he believed the United States could necessarily achieve everywhere successfully.

==Harry S. Truman==

After Republicans gained control of Congress in the 1946 elections, President Truman, a Democrat, made a dramatic speech that is often considered to mark the beginning of the Cold War. In March 1947, he requested that Congress appropriate $400 million in aid to the Greek and Turkish governments, which were fighting communist subversion. Truman pledged to, &quot;support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.&quot; This pledge became known as the Truman Doctrine. Portraying the issue as a mighty clash between &quot;totalitarian regimes&quot; and &quot;free peoples&quot;, the speech marks the adoption of containment as official US policy. Congress appropriated the money.

Truman&#x27;s motives on that occasion have been the subject of considerable scholarship and several schools of interpretation. In the orthodox explanation of Herbert Feis, a series of aggressive Soviet actions in 1945–1947 in Poland, Iran, Turkey, and elsewhere awakened the American public to the new danger to freedom to which Truman responded. In the revisionist view of William Appleman Williams, Truman&#x27;s speech was an expression of longstanding American expansionism. In the&quot; realpolitik&quot; view of Lynn E. Davis, Truman was a naive idealist who unnecessarily provoked the Soviets by couching disputes in terms like democracy and freedom that were alien to the communist vision.

According to a psychological analysis by Deborah Larson, Truman felt a need to prove his decisiveness and feared that aides would make unfavorable comparisons between him and his predecessor, Roosevelt. &quot;I am here to make decisions, and whether they prove right or wrong I am going to take them&quot;, he once said.

The drama surrounding the announcement of the Truman Doctrine catered to the president&#x27;s self-image of a strong and decisive leader, but his real decision-making process was more complex and gradual. The timing of the speech was not a response to any particular Soviet action but to the fact that the Republican Party had just gained control of Congress. Truman was little involved in drafting the speech and did not himself adopt the hard-line attitude that it suggested until several months later.

The British, with their own position weakened by economic distress, urgently called on the U.S. to take over the traditional British role in Greece. Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson took the lead in Washington, warning congressional leaders in late February 1947 that if the United States did not take over from the British, the result most probably would be a &quot;Soviet breakthrough&quot; that &quot;might open three continents to Soviet penetration.&quot; Truman was explicit about the challenge of communism taking control of Greece. He won wide support from both parties as well as experts in foreign policy inside and outside the government. It was strongly opposed by the left, notably by former Vice President Henry A. Wallace, who ran against Truman in the 1948 presidential campaign.

Truman, under the guidance of Acheson, followed up his speech with a series of measures to contain Soviet influence in Europe, including the Marshall Plan, or European Recovery Program, and NATO, a 1949 military alliance between the U.S. and Western European nations. Because containment required detailed information about communist moves, the government relied increasingly on the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Established by the National Security Act of 1947, the CIA conducted espionage in foreign lands, some of it visible, more of it secret. Truman approved a classified statement of containment policy called NSC 20/4 in November 1948, the first comprehensive statement of security policy ever created by the United States. The Soviet Union&#x27;s first nuclear test in 1949 prompted the National Security Council to formulate a revised security doctrine. Completed in April 1950, it became known as NSC 68. It concluded that a massive military buildup was necessary to deal with the Soviet threat. According to the report, drafted by Paul Nitze and others:

==Alternative strategies==
There were three alternative policies to containment under discussion in the late 1940s. The first was a return to isolationism, minimizing American involvement with the rest of the world, a policy that was supported by conservative Republicans, especially from the Midwest, including former President Herbert Hoover and Senator Robert A. Taft. However, many other Republicans, led by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, said that policy had helped cause World War II and so was too dangerous to revive.

The second policy was a continuation of the détente policies that aimed at friendly relationships with the Soviet Union, especially trade. Roosevelt had been the champion of détente, but he was dead, and most of his inner circle had left the government by 1946. The chief proponent of détente was Henry Wallace, a former vice president and the Secretary of Commerce under Truman. Wallace&#x27;s position was supported by far-left elements of the CIO, but they were purged in 1947 and 1948. Wallace ran against Truman on the Progressive Party ticket in 1948, but his campaign was increasingly dominated by Communists, which helped to discredit détente.

The third policy was rollback, an aggressive effort to undercut or destroy the Soviet Union itself. Military rollback against the Soviet Union was proposed by James Burnham and other conservative strategists in the late 1940s. After 1954, Burnham and like-minded strategists became editors and regular contributors to William F. Buckley Jr.&#x27;s &quot;National Review&quot; magazine.

Truman himself adopted a rollback strategy in the Korean War after the success of the Inchon landings in September 1950, only to reverse himself after the Chinese counterattack two months later and revert to containment. General Douglas MacArthur called on Congress to continue the rollback policy, but Truman fired him for insubordination.

Under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a rollback strategy was considered against communism in Eastern Europe from 1953 to 1956. Eisenhower agreed to a propaganda campaign to roll back the influence of communism psychologically, but he refused to intervene in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, mainly for fear that it would cause World War III. Since late 1949, when the Soviets had successfully tested an atomic bomb, they had been known to possess nuclear weapons.

==Korea==

The U.S. followed containment when it first entered the Korean War to defend South Korea from a communist invasion by North Korea. Initially, this directed the action of the U.S. to only push back North Korea across the 38th Parallel and restore South Korea&#x27;s sovereignty, thereby allowing North Korea&#x27;s survival as a state. However, the success of the Inchon landing inspired the U.S. and the United Nations to adopt a rollback strategy instead and to overthrow communist North Korea, thus allowing nationwide elections under UN auspices. General Douglas MacArthur then advanced across the 38th Parallel into North Korea. The Chinese, fearful of a possible U.S. presence on their border or even an invasion by them, then sent in a large army and defeated the UN forces, pushing them back below the 38th parallel. Truman publicly hinted that he might use his &quot;ace in the hole&quot; of the atomic bomb, but Mao was unmoved. The episode was used to support the wisdom of the containment doctrine as opposed to rollback. The Communists were later pushed back to roughly around the original border, with minimal changes. Truman criticized MacArthur&#x27;s focus on absolute victory and adopted a &quot;limited war&quot; policy. His focus shifted to negotiating a settlement, which was finally reached in 1953. For his part, MacArthur denounced Truman&#x27;s &quot;no-win policy.&quot;

==Dulles==
Many Republicans, including John Foster Dulles, were concerned that Truman had been too timid. In 1952, Dulles called for rollback and the eventual liberation of Eastern Europe. Dulles was named secretary of state by incoming President Eisenhower, but Eisenhower&#x27;s decision not to intervene during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, which was put down by the Soviet Army, made containment a bipartisan doctrine. Eisenhower relied on clandestine CIA actions to undermine hostile governments and used economic and military foreign aid to strengthen governments supporting the American position in the Cold War.

==Cuba==
In the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, the top officials in Washington debated using rollback to get rid of Soviet nuclear missiles, which were threatening the United States. There was fear of a nuclear war until a deal was reached in which the Soviets would publicly remove their nuclear weapons, the United States would secretly remove its missiles from Turkey and to avoid invading Cuba. The policy of containing Cuba was put into effect by President John F. Kennedy and continued until 2015.

==Vietnam==
Senator Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate for president in 1964, challenged containment and asked, &quot;Why not victory?&quot; President Lyndon Johnson, the Democratic nominee, answered that rollback risked nuclear war. Johnson explained containment doctrine by quoting the Bible: &quot;Hitherto shalt thou come, but not further.&quot; Goldwater lost to Johnson in the 1964 election by a wide margin. Johnson adhered closely to containment during the Vietnam War. Rejecting proposals by General William Westmoreland for U.S. ground forces to advance into Laos and cut communist supply lines, Johnson gathered a group of elder statesmen called The Wise Men. The group included Kennan, Acheson and other former Truman advisors.

Rallies in support of the troops were discouraged for fear that a patriotic response would lead to demands for victory and rollback. Military responsibility was divided among three generals so that no powerful theater commander could emerge to challenge Johnson as MacArthur had challenged Truman.

Nixon, who replaced Johnson in 1969, referred to his foreign policy as détente, a relaxation of tension. Although it continued to aim at restraining the Soviet Union, it was based on political realism, thinking in terms of national interest, as opposed to crusades against communism or for democracy. Emphasis was placed on talks with the Soviet Union concerning nuclear weapons called the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. Nixon reduced U.S. military presence in Vietnam to the minimum required to contain communist advances, in a policy called Vietnamization. As the war continued, it grew less popular. A Democratic Congress forced Nixon, a Republican, to abandon the policy in 1973 by enacting the Case–Church Amendment, which ended U.S. military involvement in Vietnam and led to successful communist invasions of South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

==Afghanistan==
President Jimmy Carter came to office in 1977 and was committed to a foreign policy that emphasized human rights. However, in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, containment was again made a priority. The wording of the Carter Doctrine (1980) intentionally echoed that of the Truman Doctrine.

==Reagan Doctrine==
Following the communist victory in Vietnam, Democrats began to view further communist advances as inevitable, but Republicans returned to the rollback doctrine. Ronald Reagan, a long-time advocate of rollback, was elected U.S. president in 1980. He took a more aggressive approach to dealings with the Soviets and believed that détente was misguided and peaceful coexistence was tantamount to surrender. When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, American policymakers worried that the Soviets were making a run for control of the Persian Gulf. Throughout the 1980s, under a policy that came to be known as the Reagan Doctrine, the United States provided technical and economic assistance to the Afghan guerrillas (mujahideen) fighting against the Soviet army.

==After the Cold War==
The conclusion of the Cold War in 1992 marked the official end of the containment policy, but the U.S. kept its bases in the areas around Russia, such as those in Iceland, Germany, and Turkey. Much of the policy later helped influence U.S. foreign policy towards China in the 21st century.

Downtown Los Angeles is divided into neighborhoods and districts, some overlapping. Most districts are named for the activities concentrated there now or historically, such as the Arts, Fashion, Banking, Theater, Toy, and Jewelry Districts. It is the hub for the city&#x27;s urban rail transit system, as well as the Pacific Surfliner and Metrolink commuter rail system covering greater Southern California. Also located in downtown is the Civic Center, the administrative core of the city government.

Historically, downtown held a dense concentration of banks, department stores, and movie palaces that drew residents and visitors of all socioeconomic classes, but after the 1950s the area began to experience an economic decline. Still, it remained an important center for various activities—government business in the Civic Center, banking on Bunker Hill, and retail and entertainment, especially for Hispanic Angelenos and immigrants, on Broadway. Since the early 2000s, downtown has experienced a renaissance of economic revitalization, including the Crypto.com Arena in downtown&#x27;s south end, and the restoration and repurposing of historic buildings in the area.

==History==
The Tongva village of Yaanga was located in what is now downtown Los Angeles, possibly near or underneath where the Bella Union Hotel was located (now Fletcher Bowron Square).

===Spanish and Mexican era===

Father Juan Crespí, a Spanish Franciscan missionary charged with exploring sites for Catholic missions in California, noted in 1769 that the region had &quot;all the requisites for a large settlement&quot;. On September 4, 1781, Los Angeles was founded by a group of settlers who trekked north from present-day Mexico. Like most urban centers in the Spanish Empire, the town grew in a grid-like street pattern around a central plaza which faced the first church. The area passed to American control in 1847, and the small town grew to 11,000 by 1880, The business district was centered along Main Street between the Plaza and First Street.

===Victorian-era Downtown===

Land speculation increased in the 1880s, which saw the population of the city explode from 11,000 in 1880 to nearly 100,000 by 1896. Infrastructure enhancements and the laying of a street grid eventually brought development south of the Plaza: Victorian Downtown Los Angeles in the 1800s and 1890s along Main, Spring and Broadway south to Third Street – all of which were razed to make way for today&#x27;s Civic Center. After 1900, larger buildings were constructed along Broadway and Spring from Third to Ninth streets in what is now called the Historic Core.

===Downtown&#x27;s golden age===
By 1920, the city&#x27;s private and municipal rail lines were the most far-flung and most comprehensive in the world in mileage, even besting that of New York City. By this time, a steady influx of residents and aggressive land developers had transformed the city into a large metropolitan area, with DTLA at its center. Rail lines connected four counties with over of track.

During the early part of the 20th century, banking institutions clustered around South Spring Street, forming the Spring Street Financial District. Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Wall Street of the West&quot;, the district held corporate headquarters for financial institutions including Bank of America, Farmers and Merchants Bank, the Crocker National Bank, California Bank &amp; Trust, and International Savings &amp; Exchange Bank. The Los Angeles Stock Exchange was also located on the corridor from 1929 until 1986 before moving into a new building across the Harbor (110) Freeway.

Commercial growth brought with it hotel construction—during this time period several grand hotels, the Alexandria (1906), the Rosslyn (1911), and the Biltmore (1923), were erected—and also the need for venues to entertain the growing population of Los Angeles. Broadway became the nightlife, shopping and entertainment district of the city, with over a dozen theater and movie palaces built before 1932.

Department stores, most that had grown from local dry goods businesses, moved from Spring and Main streets around Temple and 1st, to much larger stores along Broadway, including The Broadway, Hamburger&#x27;s, which became May Co., Robinson&#x27;s, Bullock&#x27;s, Coulter&#x27;s, Desmond&#x27;s, Silverwoods, Harris &amp; Frank, and the Fifth Street Store/Walker&#x27;s, serving a variety of socioeconomic groups from across the city and suburbs. All but Coulter&#x27;s would, in the 1920s–1950s, launch branches dotting shopping centers across a growing Southern California. Numerous specialty stores also flourished including those in the jewelry business which gave rise to the Downtown Jewelry District. Among these early jewelers included the Laykin Diamond Company (later becoming Laykin et Cie) and Harry Winston &amp; Co., both of which found their beginnings in the Hotel Alexandria at Fifth and Spring streets.

===Decline and redevelopment===

Following World War II, suburbanization, the development of the Los Angeles freeway network, and increased automobile ownership led to decreased investment downtown. Many corporate headquarters slowly dispersed to new suburbs or fell to mergers and acquisitions. As early as the 1920s once-stately Victorian mansions on Bunker Hill were dilapidated, serving as rooming houses for 20,000 working-class Angelenos.

The Broadway theaters saw much use as Spanish-language movie houses during this time, beginning with the conversion of the Million Dollar Theater in the 1950s to a Spanish-language theater.

===Recent years===

In the early 2000s, the neighborhood became popular with Artists and Creatives due to low rent, open loft space, and many vacancies. In mid-2013, downtown was noted as &quot;a neighborhood with an increasingly hip and well-heeled residential population&quot;.

Because of the downtown area&#x27;s office market&#x27;s migration west to Bunker Hill and the Financial District, many historic office buildings have been left intact, which is simply used for storage or remaining empty during recent decades. In 1999, the Los Angeles City Council passed an adaptive reuse ordinance, making it easier for developers to convert outmoded, vacant office and commercial buildings into renovated lofts and luxury apartment and condo complexes.

As of early 2009, 14,561 residential units have been created under the adaptive reuse ordinance, leading to an increase in the residential population. With 28,878 residents in 2006, 39,537 in 2008, and over 60,000 in 2017, downtown Los Angeles is seeing new life and investment.

*Crypto.com Arena, which opened in 1999, has contributed immensely to the revitalization plans, adding 250 events and nearly 4 million visitors per year to the neighborhood. Since the opening of the Staples Center, the adjacent L.A. Live complex was completed, which includes the Microsoft Theatre and the Grammy Museum.
*Los Angeles Metro Rail, a rail transit network centered on the downtown area, facilitates access to the city center, especially from the congested West Side.
*Real estate developers and investors planned a $1.8 billion revitalization project along Grand Avenue, which included the development of Grand Park, a large city park, and the construction of major city landmarks, including the Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall and contemporary art museum The Broad, which opened in 2015.
*On August 7, 2007, the Los Angeles City Council approved sweeping changes in zoning and development rules for the downtown area. Strongly advocated by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, the changes allow larger and denser developments downtown; developers who reserve 15% of their units for low-income residents are now exempt from some open-space requirements and can make their buildings 35% larger than current zoning codes allow.
*In 2009, Bottega Louie opened on the first floor of the historic Brockman Building on Grand Avenue and Seventh Street. It contributed to the revitalization of DTLA by creating Restaurant Row, which has since brought numerous new restaurants and retail shops to the area. In 2012, the upper 11 floors of the Brockman Building were bought with the intention of being sold as luxury lofts.
*Several labels of Warner Music Group moved into the Los Angeles Arts District in 2019 where the company had purchased a former Ford Motor Company assembly plant.
* Broadway retail is transitioning from a broad mix of stores catering mostly to Hispanic immigrants and a burgeoning sneaker and streetwear retail cluster has emerged from 4th to 9th streets: Sneaker Row.
* Oceanwide Plaza has planned to open in 2020, but was later changed to unknown date due to financial problems and costs.

Multiple Olympic and Paralympic events will be held in DTLA during the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.

After six years of construction, the new Sixth Street Viaduct opened on July 9, 2022 at a cost of $588-million. This new bridge replaced a 1932 viaduct of the same name which was demolished in 2016 due to a fact that it would collapse if there were a major earthquake, and alkali-silica reaction – colloquially known as &quot;concrete cancer&quot;. Pedestrian and bicycle access points link to other projects such as 12 acres of new park space below the viaduct.

== Shopping malls ==
Shopping centers include FIGat7th, and The Bloc Los Angeles, an open-air shopping area. Others include Japanese Village Plaza in Little Tokyo, City National Plaza, the Homer Laughlin Building, and the Los Angeles Mall.

==Population==

The 2000 U.S. census found that just 27,849 residents lived in the 5.84 square miles of downtown—or 4,770 people per square mile, among the lowest densities for the city of Los Angeles but about average for the county. The Southern California Association of Governments estimates that downtown&#x27;s daytime population is 207,440. The population increased to 34,811 by 2008, according to city estimates. By the end of 2019, the population of the district had grown to 85,000 residents, and 7,956 residential units were under construction. The median age for residents was 39, considered old for the city and the county.

Downtown Los Angeles is almost evenly balanced among the four major racial and ethnic groups—Asian Americans (23%), African Americans (22%), Latinos (25%) and non-Hispanic whites (26%)—according to an analysis of 2010 census data made by Loyola Marymount University researchers.

A study of the 2000 census showed that downtown was the second–most diverse neighborhood in Los Angeles, its diversity index being 0.743, outrated only by Mid-Wilshire. The ethnic breakdown in 2000 was Latinos, 36.7%; blacks, 22.3%; Asians, 21.3%; whites, 16.2%, and others, 3.5%. Mexico (44.7%) and Korea (17%) were the most common places of birth for the 41.9% of the residents who were born abroad, about the same ratio as in the city as a whole.

The median household income in 2008 dollars was $15,003, considered low for both the city and the county. The percentage of households earning $20,000 or less (57.4%) was the highest in Los Angeles County, followed by University Park (56.6%) and Chinatown (53.6%). The average household size of 1.6 people was relatively low. Renters occupied 93.4% of the housing units, and home or apartment owners the rest.

In 2000, there were 2,400 military veterans living downtown, or 9.7% of the population, considered a high rate for the city but average for the county overall.

In 2010, census data concluded that 40,227 people lived in downtown Los Angeles.

In 2013, a study by Downtown Center Business Improvement District showed that of the 52,400 people resided in downtown Los Angeles, the demographic breakdown was 52.7% Caucasian, 20.1% Asian, 17.0% Latino, and 6.2% African-American; 52.9% female, 47.1% male; and 74.8% of residents were between the ages of 23–44. The median age for residents was 34. The median household income was $98,700. The median household size was 1.8. In terms of educational attainment, 80.1% of residents had completed at least 4 years of college. The study was a self-selecting sample of 8,841 respondents across the DTLA area. It was not a &quot;census&quot; but rather a comprehensive survey of Downtown LA consumers.

An additional study by the Downtown Center Business Improvement District showed that by 2017 the population reached 67,324. In early 2020 the population was estimated to have exceeded 80,000 at the end of 2019.

==Public transportation==
===Local and regional service===

Downtown Los Angeles is the center of the region&#x27;s growing rail transit system, with six commuter lines operated by Metrolink, as well as six urban rail transit lines and local and regional bus service operated by Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro).

Major Metro stations in the district include Union Station, Civic Center/Grand Park station, Pershing Square station, 7th Street/Metro Center station, Pico station, Little Tokyo/Arts District station, Historic Broadway station, and Grand Avenue Arts/Bunker Hill station.

*The Los Angeles Metro Rail system has four rail lines that serve downtown Los Angeles: the A Line, B Line, D Line, and E Line.
*In late 2009, the Metro J Line bus rapid transit project opened, replacing two unconnected bus rapid transit lines with through service at street level through the downtown area.
*In 2006, a portion of the Metro Red Line (now the B Line) was rebranded by Metro as the Metro Purple Line (now the D Line), a heavy-rail subway line which runs from Union Station to Wilshire/Western station in Koreatown. A westward extension of the line to Westwood is currently under construction.
*Metro operates an extensive bus network, including Metro Local, Metro Express commuter lines, and Metro Rapid buses with signal priority and limited stops.
*Los Angeles Department of Transportation operates seven local DASH shuttle lines downtown on weekdays: Lines A, B, C, D, E and F. Weekend service is operated on lines DD (Downtown Discovery), E and F.
*The Regional Connector Transit Corridor connected the A, E, and L Lines between the Little Tokyo/Arts District and 7th Street/Metro Center stations which opened on June 16, 2023. This had the A and E Lines take over different parts of the L Line, which was promptly discontinued.

===Amtrak===
Amtrak operates intercity passenger train service on five routes through Los Angeles Union Station: the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot;, &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot;, &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;, &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;, and &quot;Texas Eagle&quot;.

===Transit expansion===
*The Metro E Line was built in two phases and completed in 2016. The first phase of the project connected 7th Street/Metro Center Station downtown with Culver City via the former Pacific Electric Railway Santa Monica Air Line right-of-way. The second phase extended the line to Santa Monica. The E Line shares tracks with the Metro A Line north of Washington Boulevard, and shares the Pico Station, 7th Street/Metro Center Station, Grand Avenue Arts/Bunker Hill station, Historic Broadway station, and Little Tokyo/Arts District station with the A Line.
*Union Station is set to be a major stop on the under-construction California High-Speed Rail system, though it will not be a part of the project&#x27;s Initial Operating Segment. The project would connect Northern and Southern California via the San Joaquin Valley, with service averaging .
*Work is planned to bring streetcar-style trolley service to downtown Los Angeles via Broadway, connecting the L.A. Live development with the Grand Avenue cultural corridor and Bunker Hill.

Additionally, the city recently completed a new park located on the 400 block of South Spring Street in the Historic Core neighborhood.

==Skyline==

Despite its relative decentralization and comparatively new high-rises (until 1958, the city did not permit any structures taller than the 27-story City Hall building), Los Angeles has one of the largest skylines in the United States, and its development has continued in recent years.

The skyline has seen rapid growth due to improvements in seismic design standards, which has made certain building types highly earthquake-resistant. Many of the new skyscrapers contain a housing or hotel component.

Some current and upcoming examples of skyscraper construction include:
*705 Ninth Street, a 35-story residential tower, was completed in 2009.
*717 Olympic, a 26-story residential tower, was completed in mid-2008.
*888 Olive, a 32-story apartment tower by Vancouver-based Omni Group, opened in 2015.
*Concerto, a 28-story residential tower, was completed in early 2009. A second phase (Tower II) is currently under construction.
*The Grand Avenue Project, designed by architect Frank Gehry, is a multi-phase project on four parcels. It includes a 39-story hotel tower at the corner of First Street and Grand Avenue and a civic park.
*L.A. Live, a multi-phased dining, entertainment and hotel development that includes a Ritz-Carlton and JW Marriott Hotel hybrid as well as Ritz-Carlton-branded condominiums, was completed in February 2010.
*Marriott International completed a 24-story Courtyard and Residence Inn tower near L.A. Live, which opened in July 2014, and plans to build a 20+ story Renaissance Hotel to open in 2016.
*Metropolis, a mixed-use four-tower project (60, 50, 38, and 19 stories) at Francisco and Ninth streets, is currently under construction.
*&quot;South&quot;, a three-tower complex called Elleven, Luma, and Evo, spans the block from 11th Street and Grand Avenue to 12th Street and Grand Avenue, and was completed in phases ending in early 2009.
*The Wilshire Grand Tower redevelopment, a 900-room hotel and office project built in 2017, is the tallest tower west of the Mississippi River, at .
*Figueroa Centre, a 975-foot residential and hotel tower proposed across from The Original Pantry restaurant on the Figueroa Corridor. The tower proposed will become the third tallest building in Los Angeles when completed.
*Angels Landing, a proposed super tall tower at 1020 ft. Currently in the funding stage. Approved by the city council in 2017.

===Building height limits: 1904–1957===

The first height limit ordinance in Los Angeles was enacted following the completion of the 13-story Continental Building, located at the southeast corner of Fourth and Spring streets. The purpose of the height limit was to limit the density of the city. There was great hostility to skyscrapers in many cities in these years, mainly due to the congestion they could bring to the streets, and height limit ordinances were a common way of dealing with the problem. In 1911, the city passed an updated height limit ordinance, establishing a specific limit of . Exceptions were granted for decorative towers such as those later built on the Eastern Columbia Building and United Artists Theatre, as well as the now-demolished Richfield Tower.

===Flat Roof Ordinance===
The pattern of buildings in Los Angeles to feature flat rooftops was the result of a 1974 fire ordinance which required all tall buildings in the city to include rooftop helipads in response to the devastating 1974 Joelma Fire in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in which helicopters were used to effect rescues from the flat rooftop of the building. The Wilshire Grand Center was the first building granted an exception by the Los Angeles City Fire Department in 2014. However, as the building was under construction, L.A. City Council removed the flat roof ordinance as of 2015.

==Government and infrastructure==

The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services operates the Central Health Center in downtown Los Angeles.

==Economy==
DTLA is a node in the tech economy that extends beyond Silicon Beach. A venture capital firm counted 78 tech-oriented firms in DTLA in 2015. This included mobile apps, hardware, digital media and clean-tech companies plus co-working spaces, start-up incubators, and other related businesses.

The Arts District has become a popular spot for companies seeking out something different from typical modern offices. The central location is accessible from various parts of the Los Angeles Basin.

<text>Thomas Hurndall (27 November 1981 – 13 January 2004) was a British photography student, a volunteer for the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), and an activist against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories. On 11 April 2003, he was shot in the Gaza Strip by an Israeli IDF sniper, Taysir Hayb. Hurndall was left in a coma and died nine months later.

Hayb was convicted of manslaughter and obstruction of justice by an Israeli military court in April 2005 and sentenced to eight years in prison. On 10 April 2006, a British inquest jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing.

Tom&#x27;s mother Jocelyn Hurndall has written a biography of him called &quot;Defy the Stars: The Life and Tragic Death of Tom Hurndall&quot;, published in April 2007 and reprinted in May 2008 with the alternative title &quot;My Son Tom: The Life and Tragic Death of Tom Hurndall&quot;. His sister, Sophie, works for Medical Aid for Palestinians.

==Student turns activist==
Hurndall was educated at Winchester College, a boarding independent school in Winchester in England.

Aged 21, Tom Hurndall took a working break from his degree course at Manchester Metropolitan University in photographic journalism to join the &quot;human shields&quot; in Iraq before the 2003 Iraq War. As the volunteers ran out of money and war became inevitable, he moved to Jordan and donated £500 to medical supplies for refugees from Iraq. It was here that he encountered the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), and decided to make his way overland to Gaza. He arrived in the town of Rafah on 6 April 2003 and began emailing images of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Palestinians back to his family. His &quot;Guardian&quot; obituary states that &quot;the tone of his journals changed dramatically&quot; and he justified his new location with &quot;No one could say I wasn&#x27;t seeing what needs to be seen now&quot;.

==Death==
In April 2003, the IDF were on a mission in the Gaza border town of Rafah. Hurndall and a group of activists were in the area, having planned to set up a peace tent on one of the nearby roads to blockade IDF tank patrols. Hurndall was shot in the head on 11 April 2003. According to the IDF, an Israeli checkpoint came under fire from Palestinian militants, and the soldiers at the checkpoint returned fire. Hurndall&#x27;s group of nine activists abandoned their protest to seek cover. Hurndall then ran out into the street to save two children and was shot in the head by an IDF soldier. He was taken to a Palestinian hospital in Rafah, and was declared clinically dead. The IDF transferred him to Israel, and he was taken to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, where he was kept on a ventilator and underwent surgery. Six weeks after the surgery, he was flown back to the United Kingdom, where he was taken to the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability in London, where he remained in a persistent vegetative state, suffering from irreversible brain damage. He died on 2004, after nine months in a coma.

His father told a British inquest that, according to ISM and Palestinian witnesses, Hurndall had seen a group of children playing and had noticed that bullets were hitting the ground between them. Several children had run away but some were &quot;paralysed with fear&quot; and Hurndall went to help them. Hurndall&#x27;s father told the inquest: &quot;Tom went to take one girl out of the line of fire, which he did successfully, but when he went back, as he knelt down [to collect another], he was shot.&quot;

==Israeli inquiry and trial==
The IDF initially refused more than a routine internal inquiry, which concluded that Hurndall was shot accidentally in the crossfire, and suggested that his group&#x27;s members were essentially functioning as human shields. However, witnesses at the demonstration in the Palestinian town of Rafah said he had been hit by a rifle bullet while trying to shield the children rather than having been merely hit in the crossfire, and Hurndall&#x27;s parents demanded an investigation.

===Investigation as a result of pressure===
As pressure from the parents mounted, supported in part by British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, in October 2003 Israel&#x27;s Judge Advocate General Menachem Finkelstein ordered the IDF to open a further military police investigation into Hurndall&#x27;s death.

===Taysir Hayb&#x27;s early testimony===
Idier Wahid Taysir Hayb (or al-Heib) claimed he had shot at a man in military fatigues although photographic evidence clearly showed Hurndall was wearing a bright orange jacket denoting he was a foreigner. Hayb was an award-winning marksman and his rifle had a telescopic sight. He claimed to have aimed four inches from Hurndall&#x27;s head, &quot;but he moved&quot;. Hayb said a policy of shooting at unarmed civilians existed at the time.

===Autopsy report===
The defence in the trial of Sergeant Hayb attempted to raise doubts as to what ultimately caused Hurndall&#x27;s death. A military court was informed that Hurndall died of pneumonia. Chen Kugel, an Israeli forensic pathologist appearing for the defence, stated that the pneumonia had not been properly treated and &quot;the large amounts of morphine&quot; Hurndall was receiving contributed to his death. The court rejected these claims.

===Hayb&#x27;s change of testimony===
On 1 January 2004, Sergeant Hayb, a 20-year-old IDF soldier, appeared in court to have his custody extended. Apparently he had been arrested in late December 2003 and an IDF press release said that he had &quot;admitted to firing in proximity to an unarmed civilian as a deterrent&quot;. Initially the soldier admitted to shooting what he described as a man wearing a uniform of a Palestinian faction and armed with a pistol. Upon further interrogation, he changed his story, and said he had fired a shot near an unarmed civilian as a deterrent, but ended up hitting him unintentionally.

===Indictments===
After his changed testimony, the soldier was indicted on six charges, including a charge of aggravated assault. Following Hurndall&#x27;s death, the military judge overseeing the case indicated the charge was likely to be changed to manslaughter or murder.

On 12 February 2004, the charge was upgraded to one of manslaughter. According to an army statement, he was also charged with &quot;intent to cause injury, two counts of obstruction of justice, one count of submitting false information, one count of incitement to submit false information and one count of conduct unbecoming.&quot;

On 10 May 2004, Sergeant Hayb&#x27;s trial began at a military court in Ashkelon. There were six indictments: manslaughter; two counts of obstruction of justice; incitement to false testimony; false testimony; improper conduct. Hayb had entered a plea of &quot;Not Guilty&quot; to all charges at an earlier non-public hearing. After some argument over the admissibility of Hayb&#x27;s confession, the trial was adjourned until 19 May 2004. The trial remained adjourned for much of the time leading up to early August 2004.

===Verdict===
On 27 June 2005, Hayb was convicted of manslaughter, obstruction of justice, giving false testimony and inducing comrades in his unit to bear false witness; on 11 August 2005, he was sentenced to eleven and a half years for manslaughter by a military court, of which he was to serve eight years in prison. In August 2010, an army committee headed by Advocate-General Avichai Mandelblit shortened Hayb&#x27;s sentence for good behaviour, resulting in his serving a total of six and a half years in custody.

===Military police report access denial===
Tom Hurndall&#x27;s family and their legal team were denied access to the military police report which led to the trial. After an appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court, in early August the state prosecution offered the legal team access to the report, but not to the Hurndall family themselves. According to a spokesman for the Tom Hurndall Foundation, this will allow them to decide whether Hayb could be indicted for the more serious charge of murder, and to find out if responsibility for Hurndall&#x27;s death lies higher up the chain of command.

==Coroner&#x27;s inquest==
On 10 April 2006, an English inquest jury at St Pancras coroner&#x27;s court in London found that Hurndall had been &quot;unlawfully killed&quot;. Hurndall&#x27;s father told reporters that there had been a &quot;general policy&quot; to shoot civilians in the area without fear of reprisals, as stated by the soldier who fired the shot, Taysir Hayb. Hayb had earlier told a military tribunal that the Israeli army &quot;fires freely in Rafah.&quot; The lawyer representing the family, Michael Mansfield QC, stated: 
Make no mistake about it, the Israeli defence force have today been found culpable by this jury of murder.

A week earlier, an inquest found that the British journalist James Miller had been killed by an Israeli soldier just three weeks after Mr. Hurndall was shot, a mile away from Hurndall&#x27;s position. The coroner Dr. Andrew Reid stated that he would write to the Attorney General about how similar incidents could be prevented, including the possible prosecutions of Israeli commanders, and that the case raised issues of command within the IDF. He stated that &quot;two British citizens engaged in lawful activities&quot; had been killed by Israeli soldiers, and that &quot;British citizens, journalists, photographers or others may be subject to the risk of fatal shots.&quot;

==Media==
Tom&#x27;s mother Jocelyn Hurndall wrote a commentary in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 10 January 2004, in which she stated:

It seems that life is cheap in the occupied territories. Different value attached to life depends on whether the victim happens to be Israeli, international or Palestinian.

==Documentaries==
On 13 October 2008, Channel 4 broadcast a dramatised documentary &quot;The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall&quot;, which was written by Simon Block and directed by Rowan Joffe. Stephen Dillane plays Anthony Hurndall and Kerry Fox plays Jocelyn Hurndall. Anthony and Jocelyn Hurndall were interviewed at length in &quot;The Observer&quot; prior to the airing of the documentary:

&quot;The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall&quot; was nominated for the 2009 British Academy Television Award for Best Single Drama (Simon Block, Rowan Joffe, Barney Reisz, Charles Furneaux) and won Best Actor (Stephen Dillane) and Best Director Fiction/Entertainment (Rowan Joffe). At the Monte Carlo TV Festival Rowan Joffe won Golden Nymph 2009 as Best Director in a TV Film.

==Artistic tributes==
Tom Hurndall memorialised in second movement (&quot;Dance for Tom Hurndall (no lyrics)&quot;) of US composer Philip Munger&#x27;s 2003 cantata The Skies are Weeping which is titled after by Thushara Wijeratna&#x27;s poem. The cantata which comprises seven movements for a soprano soloist, chamber choir, and percussion ensemble, is written in memory of Rachel Corrie, an American member of the International Solidarity Movement killed in 2003 by a bulldozer operated by the Israel Defense Forces while she tried to prevent a house demolition in the southern Gaza Strip during the Second Intifada.

<text>Ochre ( ; , ), iron ochre, or ocher in American English, is a natural clay earth pigment, a mixture of ferric oxide and varying amounts of clay and sand. It ranges in colour from yellow to deep orange or brown. It is also the name of the colours produced by this pigment, especially a light brownish-yellow. A variant of ochre containing a large amount of hematite, or dehydrated iron oxide, has a reddish tint known as red ochre (or, in some dialects, ruddle).

The word ochre also describes clays coloured with iron oxide derived during the extraction of tin and copper.

==Earth pigments==
Ochre is a family of earth pigments, which includes yellow ochre, red ochre, purple ochre, sienna, and umber. The major ingredient of all the ochres is iron(III) oxide-hydroxide, known as limonite, which gives them a yellow colour. A range of other minerals may also be included in the mixture:

* Yellow ochre, , is a hydrated iron hydroxide (limonite) also called gold ochre.
* Red ochre, , takes its reddish colour from the mineral hematite, which is an iron oxide, reddish brown when hydrated.
* Purple ochre is a rare variant identical to red ochre chemically but of a different hue caused by different light diffraction properties associated with a greater average particle size.
* Brown ochre, also FeO(OH), (goethite), is a partly hydrated iron oxide. Similarly, lepidocrocite — γ-FeO(OH), a secondary mineral, a product of the oxidation of iron ore minerals, found in brown iron ores
*Sienna contains both limonite and a small amount of manganese oxide (less than 5%), which makes it darker than ochre.
*Umber pigments contain a larger proportion of manganese (5-20%), which makes them a dark brown.

When natural sienna and umber pigments are heated, they are dehydrated and some of the limonite is transformed into hematite, giving them more reddish colours, called burnt sienna and burnt umber. Ochres are non-toxic and can be used to make an oil paint that dries quickly and covers surfaces thoroughly. Modern ochre pigments often are made using synthetic iron oxide. Pigments which use natural ochre pigments indicate it with the name PY-43 (Pigment yellow 43) on the label, following the Colour Index International system.
== Historical use in art and culture ==

===Prehistory===

Over recent decades, red ochre has played a pivotal role in discussions about the cognitive and cultural evolution of early modern humans during the African Middle Stone Age. In Africa, evidence for the processing and use of red ochre pigments has been dated by archaeologists to around 300,000 years ago, the climax of the practice coinciding broadly with the emergence of &quot;Homo sapiens.&quot; Evidence of ochre&#x27;s use in Australia is more recent, dated to 50,000 years ago, while new research has uncovered evidence in Asia that is dated to 40,000 years ago.

A re-examination of artifacts uncovered in 1908 at Le Moustier rock shelters in France has identified Mousterian stone tools that were attached to grips made of ochre and bitumen. The grips were formulated with 55% ground goethite ochre and 45% cooked liquid bitumen to create a mouldable putty that hardened into handles. Earlier excavations at Le Moustier prevent conclusive identification of the archaeological culture and age, but the European Mousterian style of these tools suggests they are associated with Neanderthals during the late Middle Paleolithic, between 60,000 and 35,000 years before present. It is the earliest evidence of compound adhesive use in Europe.

Pieces of ochre engraved with abstract designs have been found at the site of the Blombos Cave in South Africa, dated to around 75,000 years ago. &quot;Mungo Man&quot; (LM3) in Australia was buried sprinkled with red ochre around 40,000 years ago. In Wales, the paleolithic burial called the Red Lady of Paviland from its coating of red ochre has been dated to around 33,000 years before present. Paintings of animals made with red and yellow ochre pigments have been found in paleolithic sites at Pech Merle in France (ca. 25,000 years old), and the cave of Altamira in Spain (–15,000 BC). The cave of Lascaux has an image of a horse coloured with yellow ochre estimated to be 17,300 years old. Neolithic burials may have used red ochre pigments symbolically, either to represent a return to the earth or possibly as a form of ritual rebirth, in which the colour may symbolize blood and a hypothesized Great Goddess.
The Ancient Picts were said to paint themselves &quot;Iron Red&quot; according to the Gothic historian Jordanes. Frequent references in Irish myth to &quot;red men&quot; (Gaelic: Fer Dearg) make it likely that such a practice was common to the Celts of the British Isles, bog iron being particularly abundant in the midlands of Ireland.

Ochre has uses other than as paint: &quot;tribal peoples alive today . . . use either as a way to treat animal skins or else as an insect repellent, to staunch bleeding, or as protection from the sun. Ochre may have been the first medicament.&quot;

===Africa===

Red ochre has been used as a colouring agent in Africa for over 200,000 years. Women of the Himba ethnic group in Namibia use a mix of ochre and animal fat for body decoration, to achieve a reddish skin colour. The ochre mixture is also applied to their hair after braiding. Men and women of the Maasai people in Kenya and Tanzania have also used ochre in the same way.

===Ancient Egypt===
In Ancient Egypt, yellow was associated with gold, which was considered to be eternal and indestructible. The skin and bones of the gods were believed to be made of gold. The Egyptians used yellow ochre extensively in tomb painting, though occasionally they used orpiment, which made a brilliant colour, but was highly toxic, since it was made with arsenic. In tomb paintings, men were always shown with brown faces, women with yellow ochre or gold faces.

Red ochre in Ancient Egypt was used as a rouge, or lip gloss for women. Ochre-coloured lines were also discovered on the Unfinished obelisk at the northern region of the Aswan Stone Quarry, marking work sites. Ochre clays were also used medicinally in Ancient Egypt: such use is described in the Ebers Papyrus from Egypt, dating to about 1550 BC.

=== Ancient Phoenicia ===
Pigments, particularly red ochre, were essential to grave rituals in ancient Phoenician society. They were more than just cosmetics; they also had important symbolic and ritualistic connotations. With its vivid color that was evocative of blood and energy, red ochre represented life, death, and rebirth. It also represented the desire for resurrection and the belief in an afterlife. In order to honor the deceased and get them ready for their passage to the afterlife, these pigments, particularly red ochre, were most likely applied to their body or other grave goods as part of the burial rites. “Phoenicians&#x27; love of red is highlighted by the great number of powders of this color found in the containers. The powders were probably used to give a hue to cheeks or to lips. Besides these uses as make-up powders, we can also assume a ritual use of ointments and powders containing cinnabar or ochre, applied to the face and the forehead during preparation rituals of the bodies. The discovery of red paint traces on bones and skulls suggests that these practices were common among the Phoenicians as for other populations.” Greater-quality pigments and more intricate applications would typically indicate people of greater rank or particular significance within the community. Moreover, the presence and quality of pigments in a burial site may indicate the identity or social standing of the deceased. In addition to acting as offerings to the gods and protective symbols, pigments were employed to adorn grave goods including pottery, amulets, and other objects, so elevating the spiritual purity of the interment. The visual impact of red ochre could also have been intended to preserve the appearance of the body or make it presentable for mourning ceremonies, ensuring that the deceased was honored appropriately. This vivid color would enhance the overall visual and emotional impact of funerary displays. In essence, the use of red ochre and other pigments in Phoenician funerary contexts highlights their cultural and symbolic importance, reflecting deep-seated beliefs about death, the afterlife, and social hierarchy, thus providing a richer understanding of Phoenician customs and values.

===Ancient Greece and Rome===
Ochre was the most commonly used pigment for painting walls in the ancient Mediterranean world. In Ancient Greece, red ochre was called μίλτος, &quot;míltos&quot; (hence Miltiades: &quot;red-haired&quot; or &quot;ruddy&quot;). In ancient Athens when Assembly was called, a contingent of public slaves would sweep the open space of the Agora with ropes dipped in &quot;miltos&quot;: those citizens that loitered there instead of moving to the Assembly area would risk having their clothes stained with the paint. This prevented them from wearing these clothes in public again, as failure to attend the Assembly incurred a fine.

In England, red ochre was also known as &quot;raddle&quot;, &quot;reddle&quot;, or &quot;ruddle&quot; and was used to mark sheep and can also be used as a waxy waterproof coating on structures. The reddle was sold as a ready-made mixture to farmers and herders by travelling workers called reddlemen.

In Classical antiquity, the finest red ochre came from a Greek colony on the Black Sea where the modern city of Sinop in Turkey is located. It was carefully regulated, expensive and marked by a special seal, and this colour was called sealed Sinope. Later the Latin and Italian name sinopia was given to wide range of dark red ochre pigments. Roman triumphators painted their faces red, perhaps to imitate the red-painted flesh of statues of the Gods. The Romans used yellow ochre in their paintings to represent gold and skin tones, and as a background colour. It is found frequently in the murals of Pompeii.

===Australia===

Ochre pigments are plentiful across Australia, especially the Western Desert, Kimberley and Arnhem Land regions, and occur in many archaeological sites. The practice of ochre painting has been prevalent among Aboriginal Australians for over 40,000 years. Pleistocene burials with red ochre date as early as 40,000 BP and ochre plays a role in expressing symbolic ideologies of the earliest arrivals to the continent. Ochre has been used for millennia by Aboriginal people for body decoration, sun protection, mortuary practices, cave painting, bark painting and other artwork, and the preservation of animal skins, among other uses. At Lake Mungo, in Western New South Wales, burial sites have been excavated and burial materials, including ochre-painted bones, have been dated to the arrival of people in Australia; &quot;Mungo Man&quot; (LM3) was buried sprinkled with red ochre at least 30,000 BP, and possibly as early as 60,000 BP.

Ochre was also widely used as medicine and, when ingested, some ochres have an antacid effect on the digestive system while others, which are rich in iron, can assist with lethargy and fatigue. Ochre is also often mixed with plant oils and animal fats to create other medicines.

This ochre was mined by Aboriginal people in pits and quarries across Australia; there are over 400 recorded sites, and many of these (including the Ochre Pits in the Tjoritja / West MacDonnell National Park) are still in use. The National Museum of Australia has a large collection of ochre samples from many sites across Australia.

There are many words for ochre in Australian Aboriginal languages throughout Australia, including:

* Yolŋu languages; which refers to white ochre as &quot;gapan&quot;.
* Noongar language; which calls red and yellow ochre &quot;wilgee&quot;.
* Wiradjuri language; which calls red ochre &quot;gubarr&quot; or &quot;gidyi.&quot;
* Yawuru language; which refers to white/yellow ochre as &quot;gumbarri,&quot; white as &quot;larli&quot; and red &quot;duguldugul&quot; (when used in ritual).

===New Zealand===
The Māori people of New Zealand were found to be making extensive use of mineral ochre mixed with fish oil. Ochre was the predominant colouring agent used by Maori, and was used to paint their large &quot;waka taua&quot; (war canoe). Ochre prevented the drying out of the wood in canoes and the carvings of meeting houses; later missionaries estimated that it would last for 30 years. It was also roughly smeared over the face, especially by women, to keep off insects. Solid chunks of ochre were ground on a flat but rough surfaced rock to produce the powder.

===Indigenous North America===
In Newfoundland its use is most often associated with the Beothuk, whose use of red ochre led them to be referred to as &quot;Red Indians&quot; by the first Europeans to Newfoundland. The Beothuk may have also used yellow ochre to colour their hair. It was also used by the Maritime Archaic as evidenced by its discovery in the graves of over 100 individuals during an archaeological excavation at Port au Choix. Its use was widespread at times in the Eastern Woodlands cultural area of Canada and the US; the Red Ocher people complex refers to a specific archaeological period in the Woodlands –400 BC. California Native Americans such as the Tongva and Chumash were also known to use red ochre as body paint. Researchers diving into dark submerged caves on Mexico&#x27;s Yucatán Peninsula have found evidence of an ambitious mining operation starting 12,000 years ago and lasting two millennia for red ochre.

=== Colonial North America ===
In Newfoundland, red ochre was the pigment of choice for use in vernacular outbuildings and work buildings associated with the cod fishery. Deposits of ochre are found throughout Newfoundland, notably near Fortune Harbour and at Ochre Pit Cove. While earliest settlers may have used locally collected ochre, people were later able to purchase pre-ground ochre through local merchants, largely imported from England.
The dry ingredient, ochre, was mixed with some type of liquid raw material to create a rough paint. The liquid material was usually seal oil or cod liver oil in Newfoundland and Labrador, while Scandinavian recipes sometimes called for linseed oil. Red ochre paint was sometimes prepared months in advance and allowed to sit, and the smell of ochre paint being prepared is still remembered today.

Variations in local recipes, shades of ore, and type of oil used resulted in regional variations in colour. Because of this, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact shade or hue of red that would be considered the traditional &quot;fishing stage red&quot;. In the Bonavista Bay area one man maintained that seal oil mixed with the ochre gave the sails a purer red colour, while cod liver oil would give a &quot;foxy&quot; colour, browner in hue.

===Renaissance===
During the Renaissance, yellow and red ochre pigments were widely used in painting panels and frescoes. The colours vary greatly from region to region, depending upon whether the local clay was richer in yellowish limonite or reddish hematite. The red earth from Pozzuoli near Naples was a salmon pink, while the pigment from Tuscany contained manganese, making it a darker reddish brown called terra di siena, or sienna earth.

The 15th-century painter Cennino Cennini described the uses of ochre pigments in his famous treatise on painting. 

In early modern Malta, red ochre paint was commonly used on public buildings.

==Modern history==
The industrial process for making ochre pigment was developed by the French scientist Jean-Étienne Astier in the 1780s. He was from Roussillon in the Vaucluse department of Provence, and he was fascinated by the cliffs of red and yellow clay in the region. He invented a process to make the pigment on a large scale. First the clay was extracted from open pits or mines. The raw clay contained about 10 to 20 percent ochre. Then he washed the clay to separate the grains of sand from the particles of ochre. The remaining mixture was then decanted in large basins, to further separate the ochre from the sand. The water was then drained, and the ochre was dried, cut into bricks, crushed, sifted, and then classified by colour and quality. The best quality was reserved for artists&#x27; pigments.

In Britain, ochre was mined at Brixham, England. It became an important product for the British fishing industry, where it was combined with oil and used to coat sails to protect them from seawater, giving them a reddish colour. The ochre was boiled in great caldrons, together with tar, tallow and oak bark, the last ingredient giving the name of barking yards to the places where the hot mixture was painted on to the sails, which were then hung up to dry. In 1894, a theft case provided insights into the use of the pigment as a food adulterant in sausage roll production whereby the accused apprentice was taught to soak brown bread in red ochre, salt, and pepper to give the appearance of beef sausage for the filling.

As noted above, the industrial process for making ochre pigment was developed by the French scientist Jean-Étienne Astier in the 1780s, using the ochre mines and quarries in Roussillon, Rustrel, or Gargas in the Vaucluse department of Provence, in France. Thanks to the process invented by Astier and refined by his successors, ochre pigments from Vaucluse were exported across Europe and around the world. It was not only used for artists paints and house paints; it also became an important ingredient for the early rubber industry.

Ochre from Vaucluse was an important French export until the mid-20th century, when major markets were lost due to the Russian Revolution and the Spanish Civil War. Ochre also began to face growing competition from newly synthetic pigment industry. The quarries in Roussillon, Rustrel, the Mines of Bruoux closed one by one. Today, the last quarry in activity is in Gargas (Vaucluse) and belongs to the Société des Ocres de France.

==In heraldry and vexillology ==
Ochre, both red and yellow, appear as tinctures in South African heraldry; the national coat of arms, adopted in 2000, includes &quot;red ochre&quot;, while (yellow) ochre appears in the arms of the University of Transkei.

Ochre is also used as a symbol of Indigenous Australians, and appears on the Flag of the Northern Territory and on the flags of the Taungurung and Aṉangu people.

==In popular culture==

A reddleman named Diggory Venn was prominently described in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s 1878 novel entitled &quot;The Return of the Native&quot;.

<text>The kilogram-force (kgf or kgF), or kilopond (kp, from ), is a non-standard gravitational metric unit of force. It is not accepted for use with the International System of Units (SI) and is deprecated for most uses. The kilogram-force is equal to the magnitude of the force exerted on one kilogram of mass in a gravitational field (standard gravity, a conventional value approximating the average magnitude of gravity on Earth). That is, it is the weight of a kilogram under standard gravity. One kilogram-force is defined as . Similarly, a gram-force is , and a milligram-force is .

==History==
The gram-force and kilogram-force were never well-defined units until the CGPM adopted a &quot;standard acceleration of gravity&quot; of 9.80665 m/s2 for this purpose in 1901, though they had been used in low-precision measurements of force before that time. Even then, the proposal to define kilogram-force as a standard unit of force was explicitly rejected. Instead, the &quot;newton&quot; was proposed in 1913 and accepted in 1948.
The kilogram-force has never been a part of the International System of Units (SI), which was introduced in 1960. The SI unit of force is the newton.

Prior to this, the units were widely used in much of the world. They are still in use for some purposes; for example, they are used to specify tension of bicycle spokes, draw weight of bows in archery, and tensile strength of electronics &quot;bond wire&quot;, for informal references to pressure (as the technically incorrect &quot;kilogram per square centimetre&quot;, omitting &quot;-force&quot;, the kilogram&quot;-force&quot; per square centimetre being the &quot;technical atmosphere&quot;, the value of which is very near those of both the &quot;bar&quot; and the &quot;standard atmosphere&quot;), and to define the &quot;metric horsepower&quot; (PS) as 75 metre-kiloponds per second. In addition, the kilogram force was the standard unit used for Vickers hardness testing.
In 1940s, Germany, the thrust of a rocket engine was measured in kilograms-force, in the Soviet Union it remained the primary unit for thrust in the Russian space program until at least the late 1980s. Dividing the thrust in kilograms-force on the mass of an engine or a rocket in kilograms conveniently gives the thrust to weight ratio, dividing the thrust on propellant consumption rate (mass flow rate) in kilograms per second gives the specific impulse in seconds.

The term &quot;kilopond&quot; has been declared obsolete.

== Related units ==
The tonne-force, metric ton-force, megagram-force, and megapond (Mp) are each 1000 kilograms-force.

The decanewton or dekanewton (daN), exactly 10 N, is used in some fields as an approximation to the kilogram-force, because it is close to the 9.80665 N of 1 kgf.

The gram-force is of a kilogram-force.

<text>The Santa Monica Mountains are a coastal mountain range in Southern California, next to the Pacific Ocean. It is part of the Transverse Ranges. The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area encompasses this mountain range. Because of its proximity to densely populated regions, it is one of the most visited natural areas in California.

==Geography==
The range extends approximately east-west from the Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles to Point Mugu in Ventura County. The western mountains, separating the Conejo Valley from Malibu, suddenly end at Mugu Peak as the rugged, nearly impassible shoreline gives way to tidal lagoons and coastal sand dunes of the alluvial Oxnard Plain. The mountain range contributed to the isolation of this vast coastal plain before regular transportation routes reached western Ventura County. The eastern mountains form a barrier between the San Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles Basin, separating &quot;the Valley&quot; on the north and west-central Los Angeles on the south. The Santa Monica Mountains are parallel to the Santa Susana Mountains, which are located directly north of the mountains across the San Fernando Valley.

The range is of moderate height, with no particularly craggy or prominent peaks outside the Sandstone Peak and Boney Mountains area. While often rugged and wild, the range hosts a substantial amount of human activity and development. Houses, roads, businesses, and recreational centers are dotted throughout the Santa Monica Mountains.

A number of creeks in the Santa Monica Mountains are part of the Los Angeles River watershed. Beginning at the western end of the San Fernando Valley, the river runs to the north of the mountains. After passing between the range and the Verdugo Mountains it flows south around Elysian Park, defining the easternmost extent of the mountains.

===Archeology===
The Santa Monica Mountains have more than 1,000 archeology sites of significance, primarily from the Californian Native American cultures of the Tongva and Chumash people. The mountains were part of their regional homelands for over eight thousand years before the arrival of the Spanish. The Spanish mission system had a dramatic impact on their culture, and by 1831 their population had dropped from over 22,000 to under 3,000.

===Geology===
Geologists consider the northern Channel Islands to be a westward extension of the Santa Monicas into the Pacific Ocean. The range was created by repeated episodes of uplifting and submergence by the Raymond Fault, which created complex layers of sedimentary rock, some containing fossils of invertebrates and fish. Volcanic intrusions have been exposed, including the poorly named andesitic &quot;Sandstone Peak&quot;, which is the highest point in the range at . Malibu Creek, which eroded its own channel while the mountains were slowly uplifted, bisects the mountain range.

===Climate ===

The Santa Monica Mountains have dry summers with frequent coastal fog on the ocean (south) side of the range and rainy, cooler winters. In the summer, the climate is quite dry (except for the coastal fog), which makes the range prone to wildfires, especially during dry &quot;Santa Ana&quot; wind events.

Snow is unusual in the Santa Monica Mountains, since they are not as high as the nearby San Gabriel Mountains. The lower slopes of the range average between of rain per year, while the higher slopes of the central and western Santa Monica Mountains average of rain per year. The bulk of the rain falls between November and March. The higher rainfall in the central and western parts of the range results in more widespread woodlands (with oak, sycamore, walnut, bay laurel, alder and other trees) than the eastern part of the range, where trees are usually restricted to the stream courses.

On January 17, 2007, an unusually cold storm brought snow in the Santa Monica Mountains. The hills above Malibu picked up three inches (eight centimeters) of snow - the first measurable snow in fifty years. Snow was reported on Boney Peak in the winter of 2005; and in March 2006, snow also fell on the summit of the mountain. Snow also fell on the peak of Boney Peak in late December 2008. The latest recorded snowfall in the area was in February 2019, when an unusual amount of snowfall accumulated in low passes in the mountains. That storm system also brought rare snowfall to the Los Angeles area. Heavy graupel was recorded in Malibu Canyon on January 23, 2021. It accumulated as low as 400 feet in elevation.
=== Wildfire ===
In the Santa Monica Mountains, when the fuels, seasonal drought, wind, and terrain combine with an ignition, a major wildfire occurs. These fires are large, wind-driven canopy fires that consume the above ground vegetation and often cause major property damage and home losses.

In 2018, the Woolsey Fire burned through 88% of the federal parkland resulting in trails being closed for months. The fire, which was three times larger than the biggest fire ever before in the mountains, burned over 40% of the natural area in the Santa Monicas. A restoration plan was developed to plant 100,000 trees, shrubs and grasses of 25 different species.

==Protected areas==

Much of the mountains are located within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Preservation of lands within the region are managed by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, the National Park Service, the California State Parks, and County and Municipal agencies. The Santa Monica Mountains face pressure from local populations as a desirable residential area, and in the parks as a recreational retreat and wild place that&#x27;s increasingly rare in urban Los Angeles. In 2014 the California Coastal Commission and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved the Santa Monica Mountains Local Coastal Program, a land-use plan that will distinguish between the private lands that need strict protection and property that could be developed in strict conformance with this detailed plan.

===Regional parks===
Over twenty individual state and municipal parks are in the Santa Monica Mountains, including: Topanga State Park, Leo Carrillo State Park, Malibu Creek State Park, Point Mugu State Park, Will Rogers State Historic Park, Point Dume State Beach, Griffith Park, Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park, Charmlee Wilderness Park, Franklin Canyon Park, Runyon Canyon Park, King Gillette Ranch Park, and Paramount Ranch Park.

===Satwiwa===
The Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center in Newbury Park, California is located within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The area was purchased by the U.S. National Park Service in 1980. The Rosewood Trail near Stagecoach Inn, which leads to Angel Vista is an access point in Newbury Park.

===Griffith Park===

At the eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains are Griffith Park and Elysian Park. Griffith Park is separated from the rest of the Santa Monica Mountains to the west by the Cahuenga Pass, over which the 101 Freeway (also called the Hollywood Freeway) passes from the San Fernando Valley into Hollywood. Elysian Park is in the easternmost part of the mountains and is bordered by the Los Angeles River to the east and Downtown Los Angeles nearby to the south.

===Rim of the Valley Trail===

The Rim of the Valley Trail is a plan in progress for accessing and connecting the parkland and recreational areas of the mountains surrounding the Conejo, San Fernando, Simi, and Crescenta Valleys. With trailheads in the mountains and valleys, it would link them through existing and new: walking, hiking, equestrian, and mountain biking trails; parklands; and conservation easements. The Rim of the Valley project also has the goal to protect flora and fauna habitats and wildlife corridors between the Santa Monica Mountains and the inland ranges.

==Flora and fauna==

===Fauna===
The range is host to a variety of wildlife. Common mammals in the range include mule deer, coyotes, bobcats, striped skunks, raccoons, several native bat species, brush rabbits, and many rodents including California voles, western gray squirrels, dusky-footed and desert woodrats, western harvest and California pocket mice, Botta&#x27;s pocket gophers, and pacific kangaroo rats.

The mountain lions population is challenged because the Santa Monica Mountains are isolated and not big enough for weaned cubs to find their own territory. The primary cause of the decline is due to a combination of traffic-related mortality, anti-coagulants ingested from human poisoned prey, and attacks by other, more dominant mountain lions. The Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing will bridge the Ventura Freeway which acts as a barrier in the wildlife corridor between the Simi Hills to the north and the Santa Monica Mountains to the south. The National Park Service has recorded a dozen mountain lions struck and killed by motorists on this section of freeway since 2002 when they began a study. Mountain lions approach this particular area and turn back without attempting the hazardous crossing of the freeway as shown by GPS tracking collars fitted to them by the researchers. In 2020, wildlife biologists found the first evidence of physical abnormalities in the isolated population. Newcomers would bring new genetic material into the mountains where the lack of genetic diversity is a serious threat to their long-term survival. It would allow young mountain lions, born in the Santa Monicas, a chance to find a new territory before possibly being killed by one of the more dominant, older males. P-22 was a wild mountain lion residing in Griffith Park in the eastern end of the range, until his death in 2022.

A three to four year old black bear was captured, examined, and collared in 2023. Designated BB-12, he was probably the only bear in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and it was estimated that he has been living there for two years. In July 2023, BB-12 was killed while crossing the 101 Freeway. This is not uncommon for animals living in and around the Santa Monica Mountains; a common cause of bobcat and mountain lion fatalities is being struck by vehicles.

Over 380 native bird species call the Santa Monica Mountains home. Abundant native song birds species include the Bushtit, California Scrub Jay, House Finch, Lesser Goldfinch, Cliff Swallow, Red-winged Blackbird, Oak Titmouse, Song Sparrow, California Towhee, Spotted Towhee, House Wren, and Black Phoebe. Red-Tailed Hawks, Sharp-shinned Hawks, Red-shouldered Hawks, Northern Harriers, American Kestrels, Great Horned Owls, and Western Screech-Owls are among common raptors in the area. White-tailed kites, Bald Eagles, Golden Eagles, and Burrowing Owls have also been sighted. In addition to these residential species, many bird species pass through the Santa Monica Mountains as they travel along the Pacific Flyway including Brown Pelicans, Rufous Hummingbirds, Canada Geese, Bonaparte&#x27;s Gulls, and Elegant Terns.

Native fish found in the Santa Monica Mountains include tidewater gobies, arroyo chub, and pacific lamprey. Additionally, Malibu creek is home to the southern steelhead trout, which is an endangered species.

Snakes are common but only occasionally seen: the Southern Pacific rattlesnake (the only venomous species), mountain kingsnake, California kingsnake, gopher snake, and garter snake. The mountains are also home to the western fence lizard and the coastal whiptail. The population of red-legged frogs is small and isolated, and was impacted by the Woolsey Fire that swept through the area in November 2018.

===Flora===
The Santa Monica Mountains are in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, and includes the California oak woodland and southern coastal sage scrub plant community, and are covered by hundreds of local plant species, some of which are very rare or endemic, and others which are widespread and have become popular horticultural ornamentals. Dudleya verityi is a rare species of succulent plant known by the common name &quot;Verity&#x27;s liveforever&quot;. This species is endemic to Ventura County and is found only on one edge of the Santa Monica Mountains, where it occurs in coastal sage scrub habitat. The most common trees in the mountains are oak and sycamore. The California black walnut, endemic to California, grows on the northern side of the mountains in the Valley and Griffith Park. Other species include willow and alder (along stream courses) and bay laurel. Several species of ferns (including large sword ferns) are found in wetter, shady areas throughout the range, especially near streams.

===Invasive species===
Many invasive weeds have colonized the mountain habitats which can bring about significant changes in the ecosystems by altering the native plant communities and the processes that support them. These non-native plants include annual Mediterranean grasses, Spanish broom (&quot;Genista juncea&quot;), and yellow starthistle (&quot;Centaurea solstitialis&quot;). In creekside riparian habitats are found plants such as giant cane (&quot;Arundo donax&quot;), German ivy (&quot;Delairea odorata&quot;), blue periwinkle (&quot;Vinca major&quot;), and ivy (&quot;Hedera spp.&quot;).

More frequent fires have created conditions favorable to invasive plants. The 2018 Woolsey Fire burned through 88% of the federal parkland. The fire, which was three times larger than the biggest fire ever before in the mountains, burned over 40% of the natural area in the Santa Monicas. The fire created a challenge to native plants as black mustard with bright yellow flowers quickly established itself as a wet winter followed the fire. The mustard plants will also provide fuel for the next fires.

The New Zealand mud snail is an invasive species found in the Santa Monica Mountains, that pose a serious threat to native species, complicating efforts to improve stream-water quality for the endangered steelhead. Within a period of four years, the snails expanded from their first known population in Medea Creek in Agoura Hills to nearly 30 other stream sites. Researchers at the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Commission believe the snails&#x27; expansion may have been expedited after the mollusks traveled from stream to stream on the gear of contractors and volunteers.

==Roads and access==

Cahuenga Pass, present-day site of U.S. Route 101, is the easiest pass through the range connecting the Los Angeles Basin to the San Fernando Valley. In the 1800s, two battles were fought there, and the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed nearby. In Hollywood&#x27;s heyday, movie studios were found clustered on both sides of the highway.

Sepulveda Pass is the main north–south pass to the west, connecting the Westside to Sherman Oaks via the San Diego Freeway (I-405) and Sepulveda Boulevard.

Other passes between the Sepulveda and Cahuenga passes include: Laurel Canyon Boulevard, Coldwater Canyon Avenue, and Beverly Glen Boulevard. West of the Sepulveda Pass are Topanga Canyon Boulevard (SR 27), Malibu Canyon Road, Kanan Road/Kanan Dume Road, and Decker Canyon Road.

Mulholland Drive runs much of the length of the Santa Monica Mountains, from Cahuenga Pass to Woodland Hills, although it is not open to motor vehicles west of Encino. The Mulholland Highway runs from Woodland Hills to Sequit Point at the Pacific Ocean.

===Area communities===

The eastern end of the range, located in the City of Los Angeles, is more intensively developed than the western end. The city of Malibu runs between the coast and the leading mountain ridge, from Topanga Canyon in the east to Leo Carrillo State Park in the west.

<text>An elastic modulus (also known as modulus of elasticity (MOE)) is a quantity that describes an object&#x27;s or substance&#x27;s resistance to being deformed elastically (i.e., non-permanently) when a stress is applied to it. 

== Definition ==
The elastic modulus of an object is defined as the slope of its stress–strain curve in the elastic deformation region: A stiffer material will have a higher elastic modulus. An elastic modulus has the form:

:formula_1

where stress is the force causing the deformation divided by the area to which the force is applied and strain is the ratio of the change in some parameter caused by the deformation to the original value of the parameter. 

Since strain is a dimensionless quantity, the units of formula_2 will be the same as the units of stress.

== Elastic constants and moduli ==
Elastic constants are specific parameters that quantify the stiffness of a material in response to applied stresses and are fundamental in defining the elastic properties of materials. These constants form the elements of the stiffness matrix in tensor notation, which relates stress to strain through linear equations in anisotropic materials. Commonly denoted as &quot;Cijkl&quot;, where &quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;,&quot;k&quot;, and &quot;l&quot; are the coordinate directions, these constants are essential for understanding how materials deform under various loads.

== Types of elastic modulus ==
Specifying how stress and strain are to be measured, including directions, allows for many types of elastic moduli to be defined. The four primary ones are:
# &quot;Young&#x27;s modulus&quot; (E) describes tensile and compressive elasticity, or the tendency of an object to deform along an axis when opposing forces are applied along that axis; it is defined as the ratio of tensile stress to tensile strain. It is often referred to simply as the &quot;elastic modulus&quot;.
# The &quot;shear modulus&quot; or &quot;modulus of rigidity&quot; (G or formula_3Lamé second parameter) describes an object&#x27;s tendency to shear (the deformation of shape at constant volume) when acted upon by opposing forces; it is defined as shear stress over shear strain. The shear modulus is part of the derivation of viscosity.
# The &quot;bulk modulus&quot; (K) describes volumetric elasticity, or the tendency of an object to deform in all directions when uniformly loaded in all directions; it is defined as volumetric stress over volumetric strain, and is the inverse of compressibility. The bulk modulus is an extension of Young&#x27;s modulus to three dimensions.
# &quot;Flexural modulus&quot; (&quot;E&quot;flex) describes the object&#x27;s tendency to flex when acted upon by a moment.
Two other elastic moduli are Lamé&#x27;s first parameter, λ, and P-wave modulus, &quot;M&quot;, as used in table of modulus comparisons given below references. Homogeneous and isotropic (similar in all directions) materials (solids) have their (linear) elastic properties fully described by two elastic moduli, and one may choose any pair. Given a pair of elastic moduli, all other elastic moduli can be calculated according to formulas in the table below at the end of page.

Inviscid fluids are special in that they cannot support shear stress, meaning that the shear modulus is always zero. This also implies that Young&#x27;s modulus for this group is always zero.

In some texts, the modulus of elasticity is referred to as the &quot;elastic constant&quot;, while the inverse quantity is referred to as &quot;elastic modulus&quot;.

== Density functional theory calculation ==
Density functional theory (DFT) provides reliable methods for determining several forms of elastic moduli that characterise distinct features of a material&#x27;s reaction to mechanical stresses.Utilize DFT software such as VASP, Quantum ESPRESSO, or ABINIT. Overall, conduct tests to ensure that results are independent of computational parameters such as the density of the k-point mesh, the plane-wave cutoff energy, and the size of the simulation cell.

# Young&#x27;s modulus (&quot;E&quot;) - apply small, incremental changes in the lattice parameter along a specific axis and compute the corresponding stress response using DFT. Young’s modulus is then calculated as &quot;E&quot;=&quot;σ&quot;/&quot;ϵ&quot;, where &quot;σ&quot; is the stress and &quot;ϵ&quot; is the strain.
## Initial structure: Start with a relaxed structure of the material. All atoms should be in a state of minimum energy (i.e., minimum energy state with zero forces on atoms) before any deformations are applied. 
## Incremental uniaxial strain: Apply small, incremental strains to the crystal lattice along a particular axis. This strain is usually uniaxial, meaning it stretches or compresses the lattice in one direction while keeping other dimensions constant or periodic.
## Calculate stresses: For each strained configuration, run a DFT calculation to compute the resulting stress tensor. This involves solving the Kohn-Sham equations to find the ground state electron density and energy under the strained conditions
## Stress-strain curve: Plot the calculated stress versus the applied strain to create a stress-strain curve. The slope of the initial, linear portion of this curve gives Young&#x27;s modulus. Mathematically, Young&#x27;s modulus &quot;E&quot; is calculated using the formula &quot;E&quot;=&quot;σ&quot;/&quot;ϵ&quot;, where &quot;σ&quot; is the stress and &quot;ϵ&quot; is the strain.
# Shear modulus (&quot;G&quot;)
## Initial structure: Start with a relaxed structure of the material. All atoms should be in a state of minimum energy with no residual forces. (i.e., minimum energy state with zero forces on atoms) before any deformations are applied.
## Shear strain application: Apply small increments of shear strain to the material. Shear strains are typically off-diagonal components in the strain tensor, affecting the shape but not the volume of the crystal cell.
## Stress calculation: For each configuration with applied shear strain, perform a DFT calculation to determine the resulting stress tensor.
## Shear stress vs. shear strain curve: Plot the calculated shear stress against the applied shear strain for each increment.The slope of the stress-strain curve in its linear region provides the shear modulus, &quot;G&quot;=&quot;τ&quot;/&quot;γ&quot;, where &quot;τ&quot; is the shear stress and &quot;γ&quot; is the applied shear strain.
# Bulk modulus (&quot;K&quot;)
## Initial structure: Start with a relaxed structure of the material. It’s crucial that the material is fully optimized, ensuring that any changes in volume are purely due to applied pressure.
## Volume changes: Incrementally change the volume of the crystal cell, either compressing or expanding it. This is typically done by uniformly scaling the lattice parameters.
## Calculate pressure: For each altered volume, perform a DFT calculation to determine the pressure required to maintain that volume. DFT allows for the calculation of stress tensors which provide a direct measure of the internal pressure.
## Pressure-volume curve: Plot the applied pressure against the resulting volume change. The bulk modulus can be calculated from the slope of this curve in the linear elastic region.The bulk modulus is defined as &quot;K&quot;=−&quot;VdV&quot;/&quot;dP&quot;, where &quot;V&quot; is the original volume, &quot;dP&quot; is the change in pressure, and &quot;dV&quot; is the change in volume.

<text>The Resistance Medal (, ) was a decoration bestowed by the French Committee of National Liberation, based in the United Kingdom, during World War II. It was established by a decree of General Charles de Gaulle on 9 February 1943 &quot;to recognize the remarkable acts of faith and of courage that, in France, in the empire and abroad, have contributed to the resistance of the French people against the enemy and against its accomplices since 18 June 1940&quot;.

The Resistance medal was awarded to approximately 38,288 living persons and 24,463 posthumously. These awards were both for membership in the Free French forces and for participation in the metropolitan clandestine Resistance during the German occupation of France in World War II. Higher deeds were rewarded with the &quot;Ordre de la Libération&quot;. Proposals for the medal ceased to be accepted on 31 March 1947. For acts that occurred in Indochina, however, that date was moved back to 31 December 1947.

The medal was also awarded to 18 communities and territories, 21 military units, and to 15 other organizations including convents, high schools, and hospitals that particularly distinguished themselves.

==Award statute==


The Resistance medal was awarded by the Chief of a Fighting France to French, and rarely non-French, individuals and communities:
* who took an especially active part since 18 June 1940 in the resistance against Axis forces and their accomplices on French soil or in a territory under French sovereignty;
* who took an effective and important part in the rallying of French territories to Fighting France or rendered services in the war effort of those territories that were confirmed and logged;
* who played an eminent role in the actions of organizations of Fighting France abroad or in propaganda destined at regrouping and supporting the forces of the resistance;
* who rallied troops, ships or aircraft in exceptionally difficult or dangerous conditions;
* who joined the Free French Forces in particularly dangerous and meritorious conditions.

The Resistance medal may be revoked by decree following any act contrary to honour or integrity, whether committed prior to or after bestowal of the medal.

==Award description==
The Resistance medal is a 37mm in diameter circular medal struck from bronze. Its slightly obverse bears at center a vertical Cross of Lorraine with the relief semi circular inscription of the date of General de Gaulle&#x27;s appeal of 18 June 1940 in Roman numerals &quot;XVIII.VI.MCMXL&quot; (18.06.1940) bisected by the lower part of the cross. The reverse bears the relief image of an unfurling ribbon bearing the relief inscription in Latin &quot;PATRIA NON IMMEMOR&quot; translating into &quot;THE NATION DOES NOT FORGET&quot;. The suspension is cast as an integral part of the medal.

The medal hangs from a 36mm wide black silk moiré ribbon with six vertical red stripes of varying widths, 3mm wide edge stripes, two 1mm wide central stripes 2mm apart, and two 1mm wide stripes 6mm from the central stripes. A 28mm in diameter rosette is on the ribbon of the &quot;Officer of the Resistance&quot; medal.

<doc id="425315" wikidata="Q608413" url="?curid=425315" title="Cajun jig">
<text>Cajun jig or Cajun one-step is among the simplest of Cajun dance forms. It has only one basic step. The Cajun jig was popular in Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but remains a mainstay of dancers. Often, this step pattern is alternated with other styles, during a single song, particularly among those who are regular dancers, in urban and non-traditional settings, or those who are also Zydeco dancers. 

The Cajun jig is danced to fast or slow. Cajun music played under or timing, associated with the two-step, rather than one-step blues time or timing associated with a waltz. The Cajun Jig shares vague similarity to Merengue.

Despite the single-like step, variations of the handhold combined with turns give the dance infinite dance move options. The dancers&#x27; handholds can be uncrossed (i.e., the right hand of one partner meets the left hand of the other one and vice versa) or crossed (i.e., joined right hands over left, or left over right).

<doc id="425316" wikidata="Q5018008" url="?curid=425316" title="Cajun Jitterbug">
<text>Cajun Jitterbug is a style of Cajun dancing with two variations. The main style is a classic two-step form of a six-count East Coast Swing, which is differentiated from the one-step Cajun Jig. The other is considered a cowboy-style of Jitterbug or swing dance, also referred to as the Lake Charles Slide, the Cowboy Jitterbug and the Whiskey River Jitterbug.

Cajun Two Step is a style of Cajun dancing, also with two variations, and is arguably the most traditional. It is very similar to the country western two-step. The traditional Cajun two-step doesn&#x27;t have as many fancy turns and spins as their country western cousin.

Some Cajun dance moves are initiated from one of two basic positions: the open-handed position and the cross-handed position. In the open-handed position, the partners face each other and join right hand to left (and left to right) slightly below waist level. The cross-handed position is identical, except the hands are crossed (right hands joined on top, left hands below).

Traditional Cajun Jig, the newest form of Cajun dance features a “hobble step” alternating feet like you are stepping on and off a curb, and many underarm turns popular with country and western dance.

One form of the Cajun dance features stepping or walking, in time to the music, with alternating feet. In an exaggerated form, most often seen in newer dancers, this resembles a “hobble step”, as if stepping on and off a curb. In reality, it is a subtle weighting down of one foot/leg (right for lead, left for follower) which allows the opposite leg to move about. The effect is to facilitate turns and swings reminiscent of jitterbug and swing dancing, or versions of Country Western dancing.

One usage of the term, &quot;Cajun Jitterbug&quot;, alludes to the style of Cajun dancing which contains more turns and spins, regardless of the basic step pattern.
