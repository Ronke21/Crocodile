<doc id="416308" wikidata="Q252583" url="?curid=416308" title="List of dominance hierarchy species">
<text>Dominance hierarchies occur in many social animals.

==Primates==

Researcher M. W. Foster investigated primates and found that the leaders were more likely to be those who did more for those around them instead of being determined by strength.

===Baboons===

Alpha male baboons monopolize resources and mating access to females, and they are also more likely to suffer from stress. Lower status males must expend more time and energy for mating opportunities. Alpha males may sometimes allow subordinate males to have access to mating, so the subordinate males can serve as &quot;spare dads&quot; and protect their offspring from other alpha males.

===Capuchin monkeys===

A study on the association of alpha males and females during the non-breeding season in wild Capuchin monkeys examined whether alpha males are the preferred mate for females and, secondly, whether female-alpha status and relationship to the alpha-male can be explained through the individual characteristics and or social network of the female. The results indicated that alpha male Capuchin are the preferred mate for adult females. However, only the alpha females had strong interactions with the alpha males by virtue of a dominance hierarchy among the females in which only the most dominant and strong females were able to interact with the alpha male.

===Chimpanzees===

Common chimpanzee males use strength, intelligence, and political alliances to establish and maintain alpha position. There have been rare cases where a group has killed and even eaten the alpha male.
Common chimpanzees show deference to the alpha of the community by ritualized postures and gestures such as presenting their back, crouching, bowing, or bobbing. Chimpanzees lower in rank than the alpha male will offer their hand while grunting to the alpha male as a sign of submission. 

Bonobo chimpanzee society on the other hand is governed by alpha females. Males will associate with females for rank acquisition because females dominate the social environment. If a male is to achieve alpha status in a bonobo group, he must be accepted by the alpha female. Female bonobos will interact sexually to increase social status. High-ranking females rarely interact sexually with other females, but low-ranking females interact sexually with all females.

===Gorillas===

Gorillas use intimidation to establish and maintain alpha position. A study conducted regarding the reproductive behavior of male mountain gorillas (&quot;Gorilla beringei beringei&quot;) found further evidence that dominant males are favored to father offspring, even when there is a greater number of males in a notably enlarged group size. The study also concluded that mating access dropped off less steeply with status, so that non-dominant males had mating success more similar to the alpha male than had been expected.

===Mandrills===

Adult male mandrills with alpha status display vivid coloration on their skin, while those with beta status are more dull in colour. Both types of males engage in mating, but only the dominant alpha males have the ability to produce offspring. Male mandrills sometimes fight for breeding rights which results in dominance. Though conflicts are rare, they can be deadly. Gaining dominance, that is becoming the alpha male, results in an &quot;increased testicular volume, reddening of sexual skin on the face and genitalia, and heightened secretion of the sternal cutaneous gland&quot;. When a male loses dominance or its alpha status, the reverse happens, although the blue ridges remain brightened. There is also a fall in its reproductive success. This effect is gradual and takes place over a few years. When beta males mate-guard a female, the competition between them allows the alpha males to have a greater chance of producing offspring, since betas outnumber alphas 21 to 1.

==Carnivora==

===Seals===
Dominant male elephant seals arrive at potential breeding sites in spring, and fast to ensure that they can mate with as many females as possible. Male elephant seals use fighting, vocal noises, and different positions to determine who will be deemed the dominant male. When males reach eight to nine years of age, they have developed a pronounced long nose, in addition to a chest shield, which is thickened skin in their chest area. They display their dominance by showing their noses, making loud vocalisations, and altering their postures. They fight each other by raising themselves and ramming each other with their chests and teeth.

When females arrive, the dominating males have already selected their territory on the beach. Females cluster in groups called harems, which could consist of up to 50 females surrounding one alpha male. Outside of these groups, a beta bull is normally roaming around on the beach. The beta bull helps the alpha by preventing other males accessing the females. In return, the beta bull might have an opportunity to mate with one of the females while the alpha is occupied.

===Canids===

In the past, the prevailing view on gray wolf packs was that they consisted of individuals vying with each other for dominance, with dominant gray wolves being referred to as the &quot;alpha&quot; male and female, and the subordinates as &quot;beta&quot; and &quot;omega&quot; wolves. This terminology was first used in 1947 by Rudolf Schenkel of the University of Basel, who based his findings on researching the behavior of captive gray wolves. This view on gray wolf pack dynamics was later popularized by the researcher L. David Mech in his 1970 book &quot;The Wolf&quot;. He later found additional evidence that the concept of an Alpha male may have been an interpretation of incomplete data and formally disavowed this terminology in 1999. He explained that it was heavily based on the behavior of captive packs consisting of unrelated individuals, an error reflecting the once prevailing view that wild pack formation occurred in winter among independent gray wolves. Later research on wild gray wolves revealed that the pack is usually a family consisting of a breeding pair and their offspring of the previous 1–3 years. In the article, Mech wrote that the use of the term &quot;alpha&quot; to describe the breeding pair adds no additional information, and is &quot;no more appropriate than referring to a human parent or a doe deer as an alpha.&quot; He further notes the terminology falsely implies a &quot;force-based dominance hierarchy.&quot; In 13 years of summer observations of wild wolves, he witnessed no dominance contests between them.

In some other wild canids, the alpha male may not have exclusive access to the alpha female. Other pack members as in the African wild dog (&quot;Lycaon pictus&quot;) may guard the maternity den used by the alpha female.

==Birds==

===&quot;Chiroxiphia&quot;===
Male &quot;Chiroxiphia&quot; manakins can typically be designated alpha and beta, since there is a clear dominance relationship between them. There is only ever one alpha male, but, depending on species, there may be one or two beta males. Beta males are sometimes sub-adults - easily recognized, as their plumage retain female-like characters. Only the alpha male is ever seen to mate with the female.

===Montezuma oropendolas===

Webster et al. observed that males defend sexually-receptive females, suggesting that Montezuma oropendolas have a female-defence mating system. While the females nest, the males fight and fend off one another, and the males were ranked depending on the outcome of each fight. The alpha male eventually pushes out all other males until he is the only one left. When the alpha males leave the others come back and defend females until he returns. This type of mating system is similar to that of polygynous mammals, not birds.

===Pale chanting goshawks===

Normally, female pale chanting goshawks mate with a single male (monogamy), but in &quot;broken veld&quot; vegetation (a prey-rich habitat in the Little Karoo), a female and two males may form a polyandrous trio. In these cases an alpha male and female will be assisted in raising the young by a beta male. The alpha male copulates with the female 31-5 days before laying while the beta male copulates 5-3 days before laying. Subordinate co-breeding males may have reproductive fitness benefits by assisting the alpha female with nest defense and prey provision. Non-breeding individuals from previous broods may remain in their natal territory and form part of the breeding group.

== Fish ==

=== Cichlids ===

Aggressive behavior in cichlids is ritualized and consists of multiple displays used to seek confrontation while being involved in evaluation of competitors, coinciding with temporal proximity to mating. Displays of ritualized aggression in cichlids include a remarkably rapid change in coloration, during which a successfully dominant territorial male assumes a more vivid and brighter coloration, while a subordinate or &quot;nonterritorial&quot; male assumes a dull-pale coloration. In addition to color displays, cichlids employ their lateral lines to sense movements of water around their opponents to evaluate the competing male for physical traits/fitness. Male cichlids are very territorial due to the pressure of reproduction, and establish their territory and social status by physically driving out challenging males (novel intruders) through lateral displays (parallel orientation, uncovering gills), biting, or mouth fights (head-on collisions of open mouths, measuring jaw sizes, and biting each other&#x27;s jaws). The cichlid social dichotomy is composed of a single dominant with multiple subordinates, where the physical aggression of males becomes a contest for resources (mates, territory, food). Female cichlids prefer to mate with a successfully alpha male with vivid coloration, whose territory has food readily available.

===Moon wrasse===
Some moon wrasses live in groups consisted of a dominant male, and a &quot;harem&quot; of about a dozen other wrasses, some female and some male. The alpha male is more brightly colored, and at every low tide hour, changes from green to blue, and goes into a show of attacking and nipping all the other wrasses. This is his way of showing his dominance to the rest of the males and keeping the females in check. During breeding season and before high tide, the alpha male turns completely blue, gathers up every single female, and the spawning frenzy begins.

===Mozambique tilapia===

Mozambique tilapias often travel in groups where a strict dominance hierarchy is maintained. Positions within the hierarchy correlate with territoriality, courtship rate, nest size, aggression, and hormone production. In terms of social structure, Mozambique tilapias engage in a system known as lek-breeding, where males establish territories with dominance hierarchies while females travel between them. Social hierarchies typically develop because of competition for limited resources including food, territories, or mates. During the breeding season, males cluster around certain territory, forming a dense aggregation in shallow water. This aggregation forms the basis of the lek through which the females preferentially choose their mates. Reproductive success by males within the lek is highly correlated to social status and dominance. 
In experiments with captive tilapias, evidence demonstrates the formation of linear hierarchies where the alpha male participates in significantly more agonistic interactions. Thus, males that are higher ranked initiate much more aggressive acts than subordinate males. However, contrary to popular belief, Mozambique tilapias display more agonistic interactions towards fish that are farther apart in the hierarchy scale than they do towards individuals closer in rank. One hypothesis behind this action rests with the fact that aggressive actions are costly. In this context, members of this social system tend to avoid confrontations with neighboring ranks in order to conserve resources rather than engage in an unclear and risky fight. Instead, dominant individuals seek to bully subordinate tilapias both for an easy fight and to keep their rank.

== Lagomorphs ==

=== Pikas ===
The American pika (&quot;Ochotona princeps&quot;) is known to maintain strict territorial boundaries, and dominance between individuals is enforced through a dominant pika invading another pika&#x27;s territory, forcing the latter out. The general hierarchy of dominance has been observed (higher to lower in dominance) from male to female and adult to juvenile. Pikas with greater body mass were perceived as more dominant.

=== Rabbits ===
Both domestic rabbits (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;) and wild rabbits, such as the swamp rabbit (&quot;Sylvilagus aquaticus&quot;), maintain dominance hierarchies in control of territory and frequency of copulation. Social strata within groups of female domestic rabbits have been observed.

<doc id="416313" wikidata="Q234263" url="?curid=416313" title="Caroline Harrison">
<text>Caroline Lavinia Harrison ( Scott; October 1, 1832 – October 25, 1892) was an American music teacher, artist, and the first lady of the United States from 1889 until her death. She was married to President Benjamin Harrison, and was the second first lady to die while serving in the role.

The daughter of a college professor, Harrison was well-educated, and she expressed interest in art, music, and literature throughout her life. She married Benjamin Harrison in 1853 and taught music while he engaged in a legal and political career. She was heavily involved in the community, working at her church, participating in charity work, and managing local institutions such as an orphanage and a women&#x27;s club. During the Civil War, she contributed to the war effort through women&#x27;s volunteer groups. When her husband was nominated for the presidency, she was a hostess as her home became the center of a front porch campaign.

As first lady, Harrison took little interest in her duties as hostess and dedicated much of her time to charity work. She was in favor of women&#x27;s rights, and she was an organizing member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, serving as its first President General. Harrison engaged in a major undertaking to renovate the White House, having much of its interior and utilities entirely redone. These renovations included the addition of electricity, though the family declined to use it for fear of electrocution. Her plans for the White House would later influence the construction of the East Wing and the West Wing. She also took inventory of furnishings and other possessions kept in the White House, beginning the practice of White House historical preservation.

==Early life==
Caroline Lavinia Scott was born on October 1, 1832, in Oxford, Ohio, to Mary Potts Neal, a teacher at a girls&#x27; school, and John Witherspoon Scott, a Presbyterian minister and professor at Miami University. Caroline&#x27;s parents were abolitionists, and were active in the Underground Railroad. Her great-grandfather was the founder of the first Presbyterian church in the United States, and of the College of New Jersey, which was later renamed Princeton University. She had two sisters and two brothers. Among her family, she was known as &quot;Carrie&quot;. Her father left Miami University following a dispute over his abolitionist beliefs, and the family moved to Cincinnati. Her parents were supporters of women&#x27;s education, and they ensured that she was well educated.

While in Cincinnati, Caroline attended a girls&#x27; school that her father founded. Caroline&#x27;s father also took a job teaching science and mathematics at Farmer&#x27;s College in Cincinnati. Caroline began a courtship with Benjamin Harrison, one of her father&#x27;s students at Farmer&#x27;s College. The extent of their relationship was kept secret, and the two would often meet for buggy and sleigh rides together. They would also secretly attend dancing parties, which were seen as sinful at her father&#x27;s institute. When Caroline&#x27;s father was appointed the first president of the Oxford Female Institute, the Scotts returned to Oxford, and Benjamin transferred to Miami University so he could be close to Caroline. 

In addition to her enrollment as a student, Scott took a part-time job at the institute teaching art and music. They were engaged in 1852, but they delayed the marriage until the following year. While Harrison advanced his legal career, Scott took a job as a music teacher in Carrollton, Kentucky, with Bethania Bishop Bennet. Bennet had previously been in charge of the Oxford Female Institute. Caroline was severely overworked while in Kentucky, which negatively affected her health: as a result she and Benjamin wed sooner than originally planned. They were married on October 20, 1853, with Caroline&#x27;s father presiding.

Benjamin and Caroline were often contrasted with one another, as Benjamin&#x27;s serious personality was distinct from Caroline&#x27;s friendly demeanor. After their marriage, they stayed at the Harrison family home in North Bend, Ohio until Benjamin was admitted to the bar 1854, at which point they moved to Indianapolis. The Harrisons struggled financially in the early years of their marriage; though the Harrison family had been well-to-do, their wealth had been diluted over generations. Caroline kept house while Benjamin worked as an attorney. While she was pregnant with her first child in 1854, Caroline stayed at her family home in Ohio. The Harrisons&#x27; lives were further complicated by a fire that destroyed their home in Indianapolis the same year.

The Harrisons had three children, two of whom survived to adulthood. Russell Benjamin Harrison was born on August 12, 1854; Mary Scott Harrison was born on April 3, 1858; and another daughter died at birth in 1861. The family lived more comfortably as Benjamin&#x27;s legal career advanced. In addition to keeping house, Caroline took up several hobbies. She began china painting and playing the piano and the organ. Harrison also established an art studio from which she taught ceramics and other forms of art. The Harrisons were active in the First Presbyterian Church; Caroline participated in the church choir, sewing society, and fundraisers, and she also taught Sunday school. She was also active in the community, joining the Indianapolis Orphans&#x27; Asylum board of managers in 1860 and holding the position until her death. She served as the president of the Indianapolis Woman&#x27;s Club. Other organizations to which she contributed include the Indianapolis Benevolent Society, a group that distributed aid in the community, and the Home for Friendless Women, a woman&#x27;s retirement home.

== Civil War and senator&#x27;s wife ==
Harrison experienced periods of loneliness and depression as her husband began his political career, for he was often away and their marriage was neglected. This was exacerbated by the onset of the Civil War, at which time both Caroline and Benjamin sought to help in the war effort. Caroline joined volunteer groups such as the Ladies Patriotic Association and the Ladies Sanitary Committee. When visiting her husband at the soldiers&#x27; camp, she would mend uniforms and perform other chores, and when at home in Indianapolis, she would tend to wounded soldiers. She continued her education after the war, taking literature and art classes. Her pursuit of literature led her to establish the Impromptu Club, a local literary discussion group, while her pursuit of art became such that she began featuring her work in art exhibitions. She also took a position on the board of lady managers of the Garfield Hospital. Harrison faced several serious health problems in the 1880s: she took a severe fall on the ice, underwent surgery in 1883, and became seriously ill in 1886. In 1874, the Harrisons oversaw the construction of a sixteen-room house. It was finished in 1875, and gave Caroline experience in planning a home that would prove valuable when she became first lady years later.

Benjamin continued to pursue politics after the war. He ran an unsuccessful campaign to be the Governor of Indiana in 1876, and he was elected to the United States Senate in 1880. After his election, Caroline oversaw the family&#x27;s move to a rented suite in Washington, D.C. She served as an advisor in his political career and assisted him in his political campaigns. Her work as a family hostess grew significantly when her husband was chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1888 presidential election. He ran a front porch campaign as was common at the time, bringing thousands of people through their home. She also became a public figure in her own right, and she was used in the campaign to contrast with the popular incumbent first lady Frances Cleveland. The campaign was stressful for Harrison, and she expressed a hope to find privacy in the White House. Her husband was elected president, and was sworn in on March 4, 1889.

==First Lady==

Harrison was responsible for a large family in the White House; in addition to the president and herself, the White House was home to their two children and their families, Caroline&#x27;s father, Caroline&#x27;s sister Elizabeth, and Elizabeth&#x27;s widowed daughter. Managing this large family contributed to her image as grandmotherly and as an ideal of domestic life. Both her daughter and her daughter-in-law helped with the responsibilities of the first lady. She considered her domestic duties to be her primary responsibilities, expressing little interest in her role as White House hostess. Harrison continued in her artistic pursuits while she was first lady, and she would mail ceramic milk sets to parents that named their children after the president.

To appeal to the public, Harrison would arrange publicity photos of her infant grandson, popularly known as &quot;Baby McKee&quot;. She also continued her charitable work as first lady, giving her little time to organize grand receptions. She did implement some reforms for presidential receptions; Harrison abolished the practice of handshaking in receiving lines, and she restored dancing as a common practice. Harrison caused one major political controversy in 1889 when she accepted a seaside cottage from John Wanamaker as a gift, leading to accusations of bribery.

Harrison supported women&#x27;s rights movements while serving as first lady. It was on her advice that her husband appointed Alice Sanger to the White House staff, the first woman to hold such a position. Harrison also organized educational programs in the White House for the wives and daughters of cabinet members, including ceramics and French classes. In 1890, Harrison was the first President General of the Daughters of the American Revolution, a woman&#x27;s organization that celebrated the contributions of women during the founding of the United States. Her involvement gave the organization legitimacy, and her first speech to the group was the first public speech to be written and delivered by a first lady. The same year, she and several other women helped raise funds for the Johns Hopkins University Medical School on the condition that it admit women. This was the first medical school in the United States to accept women, and it would lead to similar policies in other medical schools.

=== Renovations and preservation ===

When she became the first lady, Harrison inspected the White House in its entirety and found many problems that she wished to address. The structure had been damaged by rot as well as by pests such as termites and rats. She consulted with Thomas Edison to bring electricity into the building, but he concluded that it could not safely incorporate electrical wiring in its current state. The extended family also found that there were not enough bedrooms between them and that there was only one bathroom. She took particular issue with the integration of the residential spaces and public offices, allowing visitors access to the family&#x27;s quarters. She wished to entirely reconstruct the White House, even drawing plans with architect Frederick D. Owen, but Congress was unwilling to fund the project. Instead, Congress authorized $35,000 () for renovations, decoration, and modernization.

Harrison made large changes with the allocated funds. The rooms were repainted, and the drapes, carpets, and upholstery were replaced. The kitchens, which had not been updated in over forty years, were modernized. More bathrooms were installed, and new furniture was purchased for the house. Wooden structures in the state rooms were repainted ivory, and five layers of floorboards were replaced due to rot. She oversaw the installation of electrical wiring over a period of four months, but the family and much of the staff were afraid to use the light switches. She also authorized other utilities, including the installation of a heating system and modernized plumbing. The wood-frame bathtubs were replaced with iron tubs. To address the rat problem, she released ferrets,and she had the basement redone with concrete floors and tiled walls. For decoration, Harrison introduced the use of orchids as the official floral decoration at state receptions, and she also had the first White House Christmas tree put up. The Green Room was redone in rococo style. By the time she had finished, she had refurbished the White House in its entirety, becoming the first first lady to do so.

Harrison took interest in the history of the White House, and she would offer personal tours. She ended the practice of selling off furnishing at the end of a presidential administration to preserve historic pieces from past administrations and mitigate a continual need of refurnishing. She especially took interest in china from previous administrations that had been stored in the attic, organizing it and creating what would become the White House china collection. She also designed china of her own to be used as the official White House china of her husband&#x27;s presidency. She had her husband order a total account of the furniture in the White House that documented the history of every item. One such item, the &quot;Resolute&quot; desk, was also used by subsequent presidents. Under her management, the White House hired its first art curator, a practice that would be revived by the Kennedy administration.

=== Illness and death ===

In 1891, it was discovered that Harrison had tuberculosis. As her health declined, she delegated her responsibilities to relatives, primarily her daughter Mary. This caused conflict with the second lady and the wife of the Secretary of State, who both felt that they were entitled to the position. She traveled to spend the summer of 1892 in the Adirondack Mountains, as the air was considered healthful for tuberculosis patients. After her condition became terminal, she returned to the White House. Her condition was worsened by suspicions that her husband had begun a romantic relationship with her niece Mary Scott Dimmick. In respect for her condition, both her husband and his opponent limited their campaign activity in the 1892 presidential election.

Harrison died on October 25, 1892, two weeks before her husband was defeated for reelection. It is believed that she died from a combination of tuberculosis and another illness, such as typhoid fever or influenza. Preliminary services were held in the East Room, then her body was returned to Indianapolis for the final funeral at her church and her burial at Crown Hill Cemetery. Her duties as first lady were taken over by their daughter Mary for the remainder of the term. In 1896, Benjamin married Mary Scott Dimmick.

== Legacy ==

Harrison is described as an &quot;underrated&quot; first lady who was more active than most first ladies of her generation. She is ranked poorly by historians, typically being placed in the bottom quartile in historian polls. Coverage of Harrison in historical analysis has been limited. Early historical analysis of Harrison&#x27;s performance as first lady often emphasized her role as a housekeeper, but her legacy has been reconsidered to include her advocacy for the arts, women&#x27;s causes, and White House preservation. A bronze statue of Harrison was placed in the Oxford Community Arts Center garden in 2018, the site previously being the location of the Oxford Female Institute. 

Harrison was celebrated in her day as a model of domestic life for proficiently managing the White House. In her role as White House hostess, she is described as unsuccessful, being unable to maintain good relations with Washington society and lacking the grandeur associated with past first ladies. Her desire for privacy often superseded her duties as the public face of the White House. In particular, she was often compared to and sometimes overshadowed by her immediate predecessor Frances Cleveland, who was much younger and widely beloved.

Contemporary historians recognize Harrison for her renovation work in the White House, and her renovation projects had a major effect on future presidencies. Her rejected proposal to remodel the White House would be adapted into a future renovation plan, resulting in the construction of the building&#x27;s East Wing and West Wing. Frances Cleveland, who managed the White House both before and after Harrison, expressed her approval of the renovations. Harrison&#x27;s work remains one of the most comprehensive projects to affect the White House. Her measures to preserve White House china and furnishings have established long-standing collections.

<doc id="416314" wikidata="Q379889" url="?curid=416314" title="Lij Iyasu">
<text>&quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu (; 4 February 1895 – 25 November 1935) was the designated Emperor of Ethiopia from 1913 to 1916. His baptismal name was Kifle Yaqob (ክፍለ ያዕቆብ &quot;kəflä y’aqob&quot;). Ethiopian emperors traditionally chose their regnal name on the day they were crowned, and since he was never crowned, he is usually referred to as &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu, &quot;Lij&quot; meaning child, especially one born of royal blood.

==Early life and ancestry==
&quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu was born on 4 February 1895 in the city of Dessie, in the Wollo province of Ethiopia. Iyasu’s father was a Muslim ruler of Wollo, his mother &quot;Woizero&quot; (&quot;Lady&quot;) Shoaregga, was a Shewan Amhara and the eldest daughter of Emperor Menelik II. Iyasu&#x27;s father was &quot;Ras&quot; Mikael, Governor of Wollo and longstanding friend of Menelik. Mikael had been born &quot;Mohammed Ali&quot; and was a Muslim until 1875, when he converted to Christianity by order of Yohannes IV in Boru meda council in order to stay in power. 

==Emperorship==
===Background===
Late in his life, Emperor Menelik was confronted with the problem of his succession; if he did not explicitly name an heir before he died, the nation he had built would likely dissolve into civil war and be devoured by European colonial powers. He had four possible heirs. According to the traditional rules of succession, the next direct patrilineal descendant was the grandson of Menelik&#x27;s uncle, &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Taye Gulilat. His other three heirs were all in the female line. The first of these was his oldest grandson, &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Wosan Seged, son of his daughter Shoaregga Menelik by her first marriage to Wedadjo Gobena. The second heir of the female line was his younger grandson &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu. Finally, the third heir of the female line was Menelik&#x27;s elder daughter &quot;Woizero&quot; Zewditu, who was married to &quot;Ras&quot; Gugsa Welle, nephew of the Empress Taitu.

Menelik refused to consider Taye Gulilat, whom he deeply disliked. Wosan Seged was eliminated from consideration due to dwarfism. In March 1908, at any rate, Wosan Seged was in poor health and dying of tuberculosis. It was clear that the aristocracy would not respect a woman as their leader, so Zewditu was also not seriously considered at this time. On 11 June 1908, Menelik experienced a stroke while on pilgrimage to Debre Libanos. On 15 May 1909 Menelik informed his ministers that Iyasu would succeed him. However, due to Iyasu&#x27;s youth, Menelik agreed to the suggestion that he appoint a Regent (&quot;Enderase&quot;) during the minority of his heir apparent. Until Iyasu came of age, the elder statesman Ras Tessema Nadew would be Regent Plenipotentiary (&quot;Balemulu &#x27;Enderase&quot;).

In May 1909, shortly before the Emperor made this decision, &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu was married to &quot;Woizero&quot; Romanework Mengesha, the daughter of &quot;Ras&quot; Mengesha Yohannes, granddaughter of Emperor Yohannes IV, and the niece of Empress Taitu. However, that marriage was annulled without having been consummated. Subsequently, in April 1910, Iyasu married Seble Wengel Hailu, the daughter of &quot;Ras&quot; Hailu Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam.

===Regency===
Not long after his decision that &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu would succeed him, Emperor Menelik succumbed to further strokes. These eventually left him a mere shell of his once-powerful self, and incapacitated until his death in 1913. During his last years, in a bid to retain power, Empress Taitu intrigued against his choice, intending to substitute either her step-daughter &quot;Leilt&quot; Zewditu or her daughter&#x27;s husband &quot;Ras&quot; Gugsa Welle (who happened to be Taitu&#x27;s nephew) for Iyasu. In response to Taitu&#x27;s intriguing, a number of nobles organized in an ever-closer alliance against her. On 28 October 1909, after a massive stroke, Menelik&#x27;s choice of Iyasu as his heir was made public with &quot;Ras&quot; &quot;Bitweded&quot; Tessema Nadew as regent.

The new regent found his authority undermined not only by the still living but paralyzed Emperor Menelik, but also by the Empress. For example, she insisted that questions from the foreign legations in Addis Ababa be directed to her, not to Tessema. Furthermore, Tessema himself suffered from an illness, which left him appearing helpless and apathetic and would take his life within a year. It took a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; engineered by a group of aristocrats and the head of the Imperial Bodyguard to convince &quot;Ras&quot; Tesemma and Habte Giyorgis to decisively limit the influence of the Empress. Despite these developments, the imperial government continued to falter: administrators were unwilling to make decisions because Tessema himself might be overthrown, and foreign affairs likewise suffered. Despite this, Harold Marcus notes that the presence of Tessema &quot;did curb ministerial dissensions and intrigues and was a reminder of the existence of central authority.&quot;

With Tessema, Iyasu continued Menelik&#x27;s program of modernization, including the establishment of the first police force in Addis Ababa. On 10 April 1911, Tessema Nadew died and, when the council met to appoint a successor as &quot;Enderase&quot;, &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu demanded a role in the process. When asked whom he desired in the position, he is reported to have replied, &quot;Myself!&quot; On 11 May, the seal of Iyasu replaced that of his grandfather, although not with the style of Emperor.

Marcus describes Iyasu&#x27;s abilities as a ruler:

In the first year, he was faced with several serious challenges to his rule. On 31 May, &quot;Ras&quot; Abate attempted a &quot;coup d’état&quot; by seizing the arsenal and its modern weapons in the palace, but was eventually convinced to make a public submission in return for being allowed to depart for his estates in the southern provinces. On 14 July, an attempt was made to poison Iyasu. That same year Menelik&#x27;s soldiers sent a delegation demanding back pay and regular supplies, which made clear that the government was on the brink of financial insolvency. Intelligence reached Iyasu&#x27;s father, &quot;Ras&quot; Mikael, of another plot, and he arrived on 14 November in Addis Ababa with an army of 8,000 men. This was only the first of many efforts &quot;Ras&quot; Mikael made to keep his son on the Imperial throne. Mikael established a powerful position behind the scenes.

At this point, &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu decided to leave the capital, ostensibly on a military expedition against the Afar, but he simply traveled through eastern Shewa and into Wollo, meeting with the common people. He had promised to return to Addis Ababa in May 1912, but instead visited Debre Libanos, then Addis Alem, before joining &quot;Dajazmach&quot; Kabbada&#x27;s expedition into southwest Ethiopia. Here &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu took part in a series of slave raids, in which 40,000 people of both sexes were captured, &quot;half of whom died en route of smallpox, dysentery, hunger and fatigue.&quot; Marcus explains this constant journeying beyond the capital by his will &quot;to prove that the government could not function without him and to force the ministers to authorize his immediate coronation.&quot;

Once he finally returned to the capital, he came into conflict with the commander of the Imperial Bodyguard, which was eventually settled by the mediation of Abuna Mattewos. The conflict began when Iyasu expressed his wish to the ministers that the incapacitated Emperor be removed from the Imperial Palace so that Iyasu himself could take up residence there. Trying to please the heir, the ministers asked for an audience with Empress Taitu and suggested that she take the Emperor to Ankober as a change of scene that might be beneficial for his health. Taitu had however been informed that Iyasu was intent on moving into the Imperial Palace, and defiantly refused to move either herself or her husband from the Palace. Informed of this exchange, the commander of the Imperial Bodyguard swore that he would protect the Emperor in his palace with his life. Angrily, Iyasu ordered the palace complex surrounded by his soldiers and only allowed in enough food for the Emperor himself. With Iyasu&#x27;s soldiers in a tense standoff with the Imperial guard, the situation deteriorated to the point that gunfire was exchanged, and the bedridden Emperor had to be moved to the cellars as his bedroom windows were shattered in the battle. Hearing the guns, the Archbishop rushed to the scene and arranged for a ceasefire. Empress Taitu then emerged from the palace to publicly berate Iyasu as an ungrateful child who wanted to kill his grandfather. She angrily declared that neither she nor the Emperor would be going anywhere and returned to her rooms. Iyasu was thwarted, but demanded vengeance against the commander of the Imperial Bodyguard. Although he had wanted him severely punished, he was convinced to accept a sentence of banishment from the capital. Iyasu indulged in a lavish celebration, which led the European diplomats to conclude &quot;that he was purposely neglecting urgent business and impeding the ministers from carrying out their duties&quot;.

&quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu left the capital after little more than a month, and during this time engaged in a raid upon the Afar, who had reportedly massacred 300 of the Karayu Oromo at the village of Sadimalka on the Awash River. Unable to find the responsible parties, he made a punitive raid upon the general population which provoked a general uprising of the Afar. On 8 April, after repeated messages from his father to return to the capital, he finally did arrive at the city and managed to accomplish nothing. On 8 May, Iyasu left to meet his father in Dessie.

==Reign==

On the night of 12–13 December 1913, Emperor Menelik II died. Iyasu was informed of his grandfather&#x27;s death. The Emperor&#x27;s body was secretly locked away in a small room adjoining the Se&#x27;el Bet Kidane Meheret (Our Lady Covenant of Mercy) Church on the grounds of the Imperial Palace. No public announcement of the Emperor&#x27;s death was made, and no requiem or any type of mourning ritual was allowed. Empress Taitu was immediately expelled from the Imperial Palace and sent to the old palace on Mt. Entoto. &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu&#x27;s aunt, Zewditu Menelik, was also removed from the palace and banished into internal exile at her estates at Falle. By mid-January, the news had slipped through the official wall of silence. On 10 January 1914, the leading nobles of Ethiopia had gathered to discuss their response to his loss and the future of Ethiopia. &quot;Although no records of the 1914 meeting have come to the author&#x27;s notice,&quot; Marcus admits, he states that &quot;it is safe to conclude&quot; that their arrival in Addis Ababa &quot;indicated their fidelity to Menelik&#x27;s heir.&quot; However, they opposed his immediate coronation, although they did approve of his proposal to crown his father &quot;Negus of the North&quot;.

&quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu showed a pronounced lack of interest in the day-to-day running of the government, leaving most of the work for the ministers to deal with. However, the cabinet of ministers remained largely unchanged from the days of his grandfather, and by now the ministers wielded much power and influence. They were constantly subject to insults and disparagement by &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu who referred to them as &quot;my grandfather&#x27;s fattened sheep.&quot; He constantly spoke of his intention of dismissing &quot;these Shewans&quot;, as he called them, and appointing new officials and creating a new aristocracy of his own choosing. His essentially reformist orientation clashed with the conservatism of his grandfather&#x27;s old ministers. As Paul Henze notes, Iyasu &quot;seems deliberately to have antagonized the Shewan establishment. He lacked the diplomatic skill and the refined sense of discretion that came naturally to Tafari.&quot;

Iyasu&#x27;s many capricious acts served only to further alienate the aristocracy. One was his betrothal of his royal-blooded cousin &quot;Woizero&quot; Sakamyelesh Seyfu to his former driver, Tilahun. Another was the appointment of his Syrian friend, the rubber merchant Hasib Ydlibi, to the position of &quot;Nagadras&quot; (or Customs-Master) at the railway depot at Dire Dawa, thus giving him control of the vast tariffs and customs that were collected there. All this, combined with Iyasu&#x27;s frequent absences from the capital, created the ideal environment for the ministers, led by &quot;Fitawrari&quot; Habte Giyorgis, the Minister of War, to plot his downfall.

===Alleged conversion to Islam===

In 1914, Iyasu assigned Abdullahi Sadiq with the governorship of Ogaden, a decision that was vehemently opposed by the British. In February 1915, Iyasu travelled to Harar with Abdullahi Sadiq, who had become his constant companion, and went to the largest mosque of the city, the Jamia Mosque, for a three-hour service. Throughout his stay in Harar he was friendly towards the Muslims, an act which worried the priests of Ethiopia; when he remained in this Muslim community over Easter, they were scandalized.

However, the foreign delegations in Addis Ababa had been lobbying for him to join their sides in World War I. According to Marcus, many of the Ethiopian nobility and commoners were impressed by the early successes of the Central Powers, and both listened eagerly to German and Turkish propaganda concerning events. Both sides sought Ethiopian support: the Central Powers wanted the Ethiopians to drive the Italians out of Eritrea and Somalia. Rumors circulated that, in return for Iyasu invading the Sudan with 50,000 soldiers, he would be rewarded with the strategic port of Djibouti. At a minimum, the Allies sought to keep Ethiopia neutral.

In August 1915, Iyasu went to French Somaliland in disguise, without informing either French diplomats in Addis Ababa or even the colonial government. There he spent two days in mysterious meetings. Although Marcus states that &quot;What actually happened will not be known until information from the French archives becomes available,&quot; &quot;Fitawrari&quot; (&quot;Commander of the Vanguard&quot;) Tekle Hawariat Tekle Mariyam, a fervent reformer and a onetime friend of Iyasu, states in his recently published autobiography that the Djibouti trip was something of a vacation for &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu, and that he spent much of his time consorting with Muslim notables in the city and consuming large amounts of qat as well as completely depleting the funds of the Ethiopian mission in the French colony.

Around the same time, the British reported that documents preaching jihad against the Europeans had been posted in the Harar marketplace. That August, the British reported that supplies were being sent to Jijiga to support the activities of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan and Sheikh Hassan Barsane, a devout Muslim pair who were at war with the British and Italians in Somalia and Somaliland. Then in September, the Italians revealed that one of their Somali agents had witnessed Iyasu declaring to an assemblage of Muslim leaders that he was a Muslim, and swore to his apostasy on a Quran. Although Harold Marcus accepts these reports at face value, Bahru Zewde is more suspicious of their veracity and instead argues that Iyasu&#x27;s intent was to integrate the Somalis into the Ethiopian Empire, but &quot;Allied ingenuity lent palpability to Iyasu&#x27;s apostasy (which was the main charge levelled against him) by forging pictures and documents to prove the charge.&quot; Whatever the truth, these reports brought the simmering discontent with Iyasu to a fierce boil against him. European colonial powers in the region began supporting a coup d&#x27;état against Iyasu because of signs he was about join World War 1 on the opposing side.

===Fall===

On 27 September 1916, while at the city of Harar, &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu was deposed in favor of his aunt, Zewditu. The nobility under the leadership of Fitawrari Habte Giyorgis Dinagde had assembled in the capital and charged &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu with apostasy, alleging that he had converted to Islam and had thus forfeited the Imperial crown. The Coptic Archbishop Mattewos, after some hesitation, was convinced to release the nobility from its oath of loyalty to Iyasu, and he was declared deposed from the throne and excommunicated from the Church. The assembly of nobles then named Zewditu Menelik as Empress of Ethiopia, and Dejazmatch Tafari Makonnen was elevated to the title of Ras, and made heir to the throne. Iyasu sent an army to attack Addis Ababa, which was met at Mieso and turned back. His father initially hesitated, then marched south from Dessie with 80,000 troops. On 27 October, &quot;Negus&quot; Mikael was defeated at the Battle of Segale. According to Paul Henze, Iyasu had reached Ankober the morning of the battle with a few thousand loyal followers, and after witnessing his father&#x27;s defeat, fled towards the Eritrean border. On 8 November, Iyasu appeared in Dessie where he vainly sought the support from the nobility of Tigray and then the Italians. On 10 December, Iyasu fled and took refuge with his followers on the abandoned amba of Maqdala. At Maqdala, he was surrounded and subjected to an uninspired siege. On 18 July 1917, Iyasu slipped through the siege lines and rallied the peasantry of Wollo to revolt. On 27 August in Wello, troops under Habte Giyorgis defeated the rebels and captured many of Iyasu&#x27;s generals, including &quot;Ras&quot; Imer. After this defeat, with a few hundred picked men, Iyasu fled to the desert of the Afar Triangle, where he roamed for five years. On 11 January 1921, Iyasu was captured and taken into custody by Gugsa Araya Selassie. He was handed over to the custody of his cousin &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa Haile Darge. &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa kept Iyasu in comfortable house arrest at his country home at Fiche.

Empress Zewditu I, who in spite of having been treated harshly by her nephew seems to have had considerable sympathy for Iyasu&#x27;s fate, is said to have tried to have him handed over to her personal custody in order that he &quot;be brought back to Christ and salvation&quot; under her guidance. In her view, the most serious part of his fate was his excommunication, and she deeply wanted to save her nephew from what she regarded as assured damnation. While her plea to have her nephew moved to the Imperial Palace in Addis Ababa was vehemently vetoed by both &quot;Fitawrari&quot; Habte Giorgis and by the Crown Prince, &quot;Ras&quot; Teferi Makonnen, the Empress took care that Iyasu lived in luxury and was supplied with whatever he desired. &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa also adhered to this policy for as long as Iyasu was in his custody, so the terms of Iyasu&#x27;s imprisonment were not particularly harsh.

==Later years==
Empress Zewditu died in 1930, and was succeeded by Emperor Haile Selassie, who was considerably less sympathetic to Iyasu. In 1931, Iyasu escaped from imprisonment at Fiche. He apparently achieved his freedom with the aid of his former father-in-law, &quot;Ras&quot; Hailu Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam, although Haile Selassie claimed that the Italians had a hand in his escape – or at least planned to assist in Iyasu&#x27;s attempt to regain the throne. In his autobiography, Haile Selassie reports that when Italian Baron Raimondo Franchetti landed his plane in a field outside of Addis Alem, onlookers &quot;noticed that inside it were a machine-gun as well as rifles and many cartridges&quot; – implying these were to arm Iyasu&#x27;s followers.

Iyasu was recaptured shortly after his escape. Having deeply alienated &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa with his escape, and having angered the Emperor, Iyasu was taken to a fortress on the slopes of Mount Gara Muleta in Girawa, where he was guarded closely by locals loyal to Emperor Haile Selassie. When the forces of Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935, aircraft of the Royal Italian Air Force scattered fliers asking the population to rebel against Haile Selassie and support the &quot;true Emperor Iyasu V.&quot; It was feared that the Italians would make use of Iyasu to fragment Ethiopian resistance to their conquest.

In November 1935, Iyasu&#x27;s death was announced. The circumstances surrounding his death and his burial place remain shrouded in mystery. One rumour that persists to this day is that Emperor Haile Selassie ordered his guards to kill him. Others dispute this and allege that Iyasu died of natural causes. His grandson and current Iyasuist claimant to the Ethiopian throne, &quot;Lij&quot; Girma Yohannes, claims that Iyasu&#x27;s body was brought to the Church of St. Mark at Addis Ababa&#x27;s Guenete Leul Palace (since 1961 the main campus of Addis Ababa University) and buried there in secret. Because he had been excommunicated, these claims are extremely unlikely. Another recently published account states that Iyasu was interred in the grave prepared for Emperor Haile Selassie&#x27;s confessor and almoner, Abba Hanna Jimma, at Debre Libanos. This account contends that, upon the priest&#x27;s death, &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu&#x27;s remains were moved to the crypt of St. Tekle Haimanot&#x27;s Church at the monastery, and placed below the tomb prepared for Ethiopia&#x27;s first Patriarch, Abuna Basilios.

==Family==
His younger sister Zenebe Worq was married off at a young age to &quot;Ras&quot; Bezabih of Gojjam, but died in childbirth. Iyasu also had an elder half-sister, &quot;Woizero&quot; Sehin Mikael, married to &quot;Jantirar&quot; Asfaw, Lord of Ambassel, whose daughter would eventually become Empress Menen Asfaw, wife of Emperor Haile Selassie. Another half sister of &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu was &quot;Woizero&quot; Tewabech Mikael, second wife of Ras Seyoum Mangasha of Tigray. While through his Imperial mother, Iyasu could claim to be descended from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, through his father, he claimed descent from Muhammad. Iyasu seems to have had at least thirteen secondary wives and an uncertain number of natural children, several of whom have been Iyasuist claimants to the Imperial throne, as well as grandchildren like Girma Yohannes. &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu&#x27;s only legitimate child was a daughter born in 1916 to him and Seble Wengel Hailu, Alem Tsahai Iyasu, who was granted the title of Emebet-hoy by Emperor Haile Selassie.

==Evaluation==
The Ethiopian historian Bahru Zewde describes Iyasu&#x27;s reign as &quot;one of the most enigmatic in Ethiopian history.&quot; A common account of his reign is provided by J. Spencer Trimingham, who writes that his acts favoring Islam were
...encouraged by German and Turkish diplomats. He made the &quot;fuqaha&quot; construct a genealogy deriving his ancestry on his father&#x27;s side from the Prophet. He made prolonged stays in Harar where he adopted Muslim dress and customs. He put away his Christian wife, Romane-Warq, and started a &quot;harim&quot; by marrying the daughters of &#x27;Afar and Oromo chiefs, including a daughter and niece of Abba Jifar of Jimma. He built mosques at Dire Dawa and Jigjiga. In 1916 he officially placed Abyssinia in religious dependence upon Turkey, and sent the Turkish consul-general an Abyssinian flag embroidered with a crescent and the Islamic formula of faith. He sent similar flags to his own Muslim chiefs and promised to lead them to the &quot;jihad&quot;. He entered into negotiations with Muhammed ibn &#x27;Abd Allah, the Mahdi of the Ogaden, and sent him rifles and ammunition. He then issued a summons to all Somalis, some of whom regarded him as true Mahdi, to follow him in a &quot;jihad&quot; against the Christians, and went to Jigjiga to collect an army.

According to &quot;Fitawrari&quot; Tekle Hawariat Tekle Mariyam, &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu at one point announced &quot;If I do not make Ethiopia Muslim, then I am not Iyasu.&quot; He also recalls &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu&#x27;s visit to Dire Dawa in 1916, when the ruler walked into a Roman Catholic church in that city (this act alone would scandalize the Ethiopian Orthodox establishment) and commenced to light and smoke a cigarette while Mass was being conducted. Tekle Hawariat concludes that Iyasu was completely unsuited for the throne, and that his deposing was necessary for the survival of the Empire and the good of the people.

Bahru Zewde on the other hand, while admitting that &quot;contradiction and inconsistency were the hallmark of his character and policies&quot;, notes that Iyasu&#x27;s reign was characterized by &quot;a series of measures which, because of the social and economic security they implied, may well be considered progressive.&quot; Iyasu modernized many sections of the Ethiopian criminal code, and created a municipal police force, the &quot;Terenbulle&quot;. His overtures to the Muslim inhabitants of Ethiopia &quot;can be interpreted as one of trying to redress the injustices of the past, of making the Muslims feel at home in their own country.&quot;

However, Iyasu had the misfortune of being succeeded (in Bahru Zewde&#x27;s words) &quot;by a ruler of extraordinary political longevity who found it in his interest to suppress any objective appreciation of the man.&quot; According to Paul B. Henze, during the reign of his cousin Haile Selassie, Iyasu was &quot;practically an &#x27;unperson&#x27;. If he was referred to at all, it was invariably in extremely negative terms.&quot; While admitting the lack of information about this man, Henze suggests that &quot;the fairest conclusion that can be reached on the basis of present knowledge may be to credit him with good intentions but condemn him for intemperate, inept and in the end, disastrous performance.&quot;

<text>A parliamentary secretary is a member of parliament in the Westminster system who assists a more senior minister with their duties. In several countries, the position has been re-designated as assistant minister, junior minister or associate minister.

In the parliamentary systems of several Commonwealth countries, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, India and Singapore, it is customary for the prime minister to appoint parliamentary secretaries from their political party in parliament to assist cabinet ministers with their work. The role of parliamentary secretaries varies under different prime ministers. The post has often served as a training ground for future ministers.

== In the Commonwealth ==

=== Australia ===
In Australia, parliamentary secretaries are appointed in the federal government and most state governments. At the federal level, the Australian constitution provides only for the appointment of &quot;ministers of state&quot;. Parliamentary secretaries are formally ministers of state, however they are not responsible for any portfolios and act under the direction of a more senior minister. Since 2015, &quot;parliamentary secretaries&quot; have been titled as &quot;assistant ministers&quot;. However, they remain formally &quot;parliamentary secretaries&quot; under the &quot;Ministers of State Act 1952&quot;. An assistant minister&#x27;s title may not necessarily correspond to their official position, with Matt Thistlethwaite in 2022 titled the &quot;Assistant Minister for the Republic&quot; while formally they held the offices of &quot;Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, Minister for Defence and Minister for Veterans Affairs&quot;. The prime minister is permitted to appoint a member from either house of Parliament to be a parliamentary secretary to a minister. As they are ministers of state for constitutional purposes, parliamentary secretaries may be paid a salary.

According to Paul Keating in 1993, &quot;the institution of Parliamentary Secretary provides a very inexpensive means not only of giving talented individuals executive experience but providing Ministers with needed support.&quot;

In the state of Queensland, parliamentary secretaries were re-designated as &#x27;assistant ministers&#x27; following the 2012 Queensland election.

===Canada===
During Jean Chrétien&#x27;s term as Prime Minister of Canada, parliamentary secretaries were set to two-year terms and the post was used as a reward for weary backbenchers. Their duty was to answer questions and table reports on behalf of ministers when they were unable to be present in the house.

Chrétien&#x27;s successor as Canadian prime minister, Paul Martin, when sworn in in 2003, promised a new role for parliamentary secretaries. They would now be sworn into the privy council, giving them access to some secret documents, and allowing them to attend Canadian Cabinet meetings and be assigned specific files by ministers. This replaced the positions of secretaries of state which had been employed under Chrétien.

===Sri Lanka independence===
===1972(Ceylon Dutch 1658-1796/Britain 1796( annexed) (ceded by the Dutch 1815-1948)Ceylon 1948-1972 British Commonwealth of Nations ===
Under the Soulbury Constitution, junior members of parliament were appointed to serve as parliamentary secretaries. Each cabinet minister would have one parliamentary secretary. In 1972, the republican constitution replace the position of parliamentary secretary with that of deputy minister. With the parliamentary secretary for external affairs and defence serving as the de facto parliamentary secretary to the prime minister of Ceylon.

===Malaysia===
===Mauritius===
Since the 1968 Independence the constitution of Mauritius allowed for 14 ministers and 5 parliamentary secretaries. Initially the role of a parliamentary secretary was to assist ministers. The number of such positions rose steadily but their roles have progressively changed. After the 1987 elections the candidates who had missed out on ministerial positions were nominated as parliamentary secretaries.

=== New Zealand ===
The position titled Parliamentary Under-Secretary is established by the Constitution Act 1986. Unlike ministers in the New Zealand Government, parliamentary under-secretaries are not members of the Executive Council.

New Zealand also has Parliamentary Private Secretaries.

=== Singapore ===
=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, parliamentary secretary (in full, usually Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in those departments headed by a secretary of state) is the third level of government minister, below minister of state and secretary of state (or another minister of secretary of state rank, such as the chancellor of the exchequer). Not all departments have all three levels of minister.

A parliamentary private secretary (PPS), on the other hand, is a member of parliament who acts as an unpaid assistant to an individual minister, but has no ministerial role, although is expected to support the government at all times.

== Outside the Commonwealth ==

=== Germany ===

A parliamentary state secretary (&quot;&quot;) is a member of the Bundestag given a portfolio to assist a minister with running a government ministry. The position is roughly analogous to deputy ministers.

In 2021, there are 36 parliamentary state secretaries in the Merkel IV Cabinet. The position was first introduced in 1967 to help younger politicians gain experience for future ministerial roles.

===Ireland===
In the Irish Free State, the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 created the post of parliamentary secretary (), originally limited to seven holders. In 1978, the office was superseded in Ireland by the office of Minister of State.

<doc id="416322" wikidata="Q234261" url="?curid=416322" title="Lucretia Garfield">
<text>Lucretia Garfield ( Rudolph; April 19, 1832 – March 14, 1918) was the first lady of the United States from March to September 1881, as the wife of James A. Garfield, the 20th president of the United States. 

Born in Garrettsville, Ohio, Garfield first met her husband at Geauga Seminary. After a long courtship, they married in 1858. Their early years were difficult, as James was often away and became romantically involved with other women. They would eventually have seven children together, five of whom lived to adulthood. Highly educated and knowledgeable of Washington politics, Garfield was a regular adviser for her husband, and she assisted him in his front porch campaign for the presidency. She was well regarded during her brief period in the White House, but after only a few months contracted malaria and went to Long Branch, New Jersey, to recuperate.

On July 2 1881, her husband was shot and mortally wounded by Charles Guiteau. He remained on his deathbed for months, during which time his wife stayed at his bedside and received much public sympathy. Garfield returned to her former residence in Ohio after being widowed, and she spent much of the rest of her life preserving her husband&#x27;s papers and other materials, establishing what was effectively the first presidential library.

==Early life==
Lucretia &quot;Crete&quot; Rudolph was born in Garrettsville, Ohio, on April 19, 1832. She was the daughter of carpenter Zebulon Rudolph and Arabella Mason Rudolph, the first of four children. She was raised as a member of the Disciples of Christ. Rudolph was often in poor health as a child, suffering from respiratory issues. Spending long periods of time bedridden as a child, she developed a love for reading. Her family was reserved, with very few outward shows of affection.

Rudolph learned household skills from her mother, such as cleaning and cooking, as was common for girls at the time. Her parents also decided to have her receive a formal education, which was less common, and she attended the town&#x27;s grammar school. She then attended the Geauga Seminary in Chester Township, Ohio, at same time as James A. Garfield. Her father co-founded the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (now Hiram College), and she began attending the school in 1850. Here she pursued her interest in literature, starting a literary group and contributing to a school magazine. James attended the school as well, and he also took on a teaching position, becoming one of Randolph&#x27;s teachers. Rudolph expressed beliefs that women were capable of their own achievements in society and that they should receive equal pay in employment, though she abandoned these beliefs after leaving college.

Rudolph and Garfield began a personal correspondence in November 1853, and they agreed to marry in early 1854. They began a courtship by letter when Garfield moved away to attend Williams College. Garfield first noticed her for her intelligence, though he discouraged her from overexerting herself in her studies. Rudolph became a teacher, instructing classes in Cleveland and Ravenna, Ohio. The strength of their relationship fluctuated over the following years, as Garfield lamented Rudolph&#x27;s reserved demeanor. At one point, Garfield began a relationship with another woman, Rebecca Selleck, while he attended Williams College. Only after returning home and being allowed to read Rudolph&#x27;s diary did Garfield realize the extent of her commitment.

==Marriage and family==

=== &quot;Years of darkness&quot; ===
Lucretia Rudolph and James Garfield married at Rudolph&#x27;s home on November 11, 1858. Both had serious doubts about the wedding in the time leading up to their marriage, as they both felt that they had to marry because they were expected to do so, and Rudolph was worried that she would lose any independence that she had obtained with a career. They did not have a honeymoon after their marriage, instead moving straight into a boarding house.

Lucretia Garfield&#x27;s life did not change significantly in the years after her marriage, during which she continued working as a teacher. Her husband was rarely home, away as a preacher, as a state legislator, and then as an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. In these first five years, they spent no more than 20 weeks together, and James openly expressed regret and contempt for their marriage. Garfield kept living her life independently, maintaining her own social life and traveling without her husband. She was hurt by the lack of attention he showed her, particularly after the birth of their first child, Eliza, in 1860. When James went to war in 1861, Lucretia returned to her parents&#x27; home. They later described this period of their lives as their &quot;years of darkness&quot;.

The Garfields did not develop a close relationship until James returned home from the Civil War, on leave after falling seriously ill with dysentery. They moved to a farmhouse in Howland Springs, Ohio, where he could recover. This was the first home that they had to themselves, and historians have described this period as a belated honeymoon. It was short lived, as he was called back to war the following month after he had recovered. His return to the military marked an end to this improvement in their relationship, and they were again distant from one another. James pursued other women while away, again expressing interest in Selleck as well as Kate Chase. Garfield had her second child, Harry, in 1863. Two months later, their firstborn died of diphtheria. This sudden death strengthened their relationship further as they shared their grief.

=== Congressional wife ===
Shortly after their daughter&#x27;s death, James moved to Washington, D.C., as he had been elected to the United States House of Representatives. Lucretia remained in Ohio, where she again felt lonely as her husband was away. While James was away, he engaged in romantic intimacy with Lucia Calhoun, an editorial writer, and then confessed to his wife. The extent of James&#x27;s actions are unknown; he traveled to New York on Lucretia&#x27;s request to retrieve the compromising letters he sent and destroy them. The Garfields determined that they had to fix their marriage, and their relationship began to improve. Garfield began visiting her husband in Washington in early 1864. She had two more children during this time: she had her third child, James, in 1865 while she stayed in Washington, and she had her fourth child Mary, in 1867.

The Garfields often traveled to New Jersey each summer, and they took a vacation to Europe in 1867. In 1869, the family decided to relocate to Washington permanently, and they built a home in the capital. It was the first home that they owned themselves, and it was the first time that Lucretia and James lived together for an extended period of time. She had three more children while living here: Irvin in 1870, Abram in 1872, and Edward in 1874. Also among their household were servants, governesses, and James&#x27;s mother. Their youngest son died in 1876. The same year, they purchased a farm in Ohio so they had a home of their own that they could live in each summer. Garfield agreed with the belief that women should live domestic lives, though she also resented the idea. She did not play a direct role in her husband&#x27;s Congressional career, hosting and attending very few Washington social events. Instead, she offered him advice, and she visited the United States Capitol to watch him speak in Congress.

=== 1880 presidential election ===
Garfield was dismayed when her husband was only raised as a compromise presidential candidate during the 1880 Republican National Convention; she wished that he would be nominated because he was the most popular choice. Over the following months, they held a front porch campaign in which countless voters visited the Garfield home to meet the candidate. She only learned that he was successfully nominated when the first visitors arrived with the news. Garfield became the first spouse of a presidential candidate to appear on a campaign poster, though she only allowed the one photo to be taken of her for the campaign. James was elected president in the 1880 presidential election.

During the interim period in which James was president-elect, Lucretia became his closest adviser. When he was choosing members of his presidential cabinet, she insisted on the inclusion of James G. Blaine, whom she admired, while she rejected Thaddeus C. Pound because his wife had once been involved in a scandal. She also urged her husband not to trust the Stalwart faction of his party, insisting that he &quot;fight them dead&quot;. Her distrust of the Stalwarts came not only from Blaine&#x27;s warnings about them, but also the fact that Stalwart leader Roscoe Conkling, like her husband, had been romantically involved with Kate Chase. Leading up to the inauguration, Garfield traveled to New York under an alias to shop for a dress, and the Garfields arrived in Washington on March 1, 1881.

==First Lady of the United States==

=== White House hostess ===
Garfield became first lady on March 4, 1881, after her husband was inaugurated as President of the United States. Her hosting responsibilities as first lady went far beyond those that were expected of her when she was a Congressional wife, and she sought advice from Blaine&#x27;s wife, Harriet. Her interest was in the opportunity to meet prominent writers and artists, and she entered the White House with a list of names she wished to invite. Garfield paid more attention to political aspects of the role than the social aspects, and the president kept her updated on happenings in Washington that were not known to the public. Though she believed in gender equality, she rejected the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, feeling that women had yet to embrace education, which she believed was necessary before equality could be achieved.

Unlike her predecessor, Lucy Webb Hayes, Garfield did not have strong opinions about the temperance movement, and she resumed the serving of alcohol at White House events. This was a decision of some political consequence, as the temperance movement was a predominantly Republican voting bloc, but the banning of alcohol displeased prominent Washington figures and foreign diplomats. She dismissed the temperance advocates lobbying her to reinstate the ban, determining that alcohol in the White House was a small aspect of temperance receiving disproportionate attention.

As her tenure began, Garfield took on the responsibility of refurbishing the White House and lobbying Congress for funding to this end. She took particular interest in White House history, and she often visited the Library of Congress to research the building. Garfield participated in only one interview while she was first lady, in which she freely spoke about politics and her support for Blaine.

=== Assassination of James A. Garfield ===

Only two months into her tenure as first lady, Garfield was afflicted with a life-threatening case of malaria. The president suspended many of his duties so that he could personally tend to her. Her health began to return by June, and her husband rented a cottage in Long Branch, New Jersey, for her to live in while she recuperated. Charles J. Guiteau waited to intercept them with the intention of shooting the president, but the sight of Lucretia, still visibly ill, caused him to hesitate. Weeks later, on July 2, Guiteau shot the president. The shot was not immediately lethal, and James sent David G. Swaim to inform Lucretia. A train was arranged to take her directly to Washington so she could see her injured husband.

Over the following months, Lucretia stayed by James&#x27;s bed as his injuries became infected and his health deteriorated. She insisted that her own personal physician, Susan Ann Edson, one of the country&#x27;s first female physicians, was among those treating the president. Garfield&#x27;s anguish while sitting at her husband&#x27;s deathbed earned her widespread sympathy and admiration from the public. The president died on September 19, 1881.

==Later life and death==

Garfield organized her husband&#x27;s public funeral and the creation of his tomb in Lake View Cemetery. She was financially secure as a widow. In addition to an annual $5,000 pension granted by Congress (), Cyrus W. Field saw to the creation of a donation drive for her and her children that accumulated a large sum of money. Despite this wealth, she continued to live economically.

Over the following years, Garfield worked to preserve records of her husband&#x27;s presidency and his legacy. She worked with historian Theodore Clarke Smith to organize her husband&#x27;s papers and to document her own memories of the presidency. In 1885, she oversaw the construction of a library on her Ohio property to house all of her husband&#x27;s books and presidential documents. This came to be recognized as the first presidential library.

In her old age, Garfield found a winter home in South Pasadena, California. She became a prominent member of the community, and she attended the first Rose Parade. When World War I began, she carried out volunteer work each day with the Pasadena Red Cross war committee. When Theodore Roosevelt became president, Garfield became a supporter of his progressivism. In 1916, she supported Democrat Woodrow Wilson for president. Garfield died of pneumonia at her winter home in South Pasadena, California, on March 19, 1918. She was buried with her husband in Lake View Cemetery.

== Legacy ==

Garfield had one of the shortest tenures of any first lady, second only to Anna Harrison. Despite this short tenure, she has received more attention from historians than her predecessor, Lucy Hayes. This short tenure precluded any direct influence that she may have had on the position, but her practice of preserving her husband&#x27;s documents in a library was adopted by other first ladies, such as Edith Wilson and Nancy Reagan. Garfield&#x27;s own papers are kept in the Library of Congress. She was only the second of the first ladies to receive higher education. 

=== Historical assessments ===
Since 1982 Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. In terms of cumulative assessment, Garfield has been ranked:

* 30th-best of 42 in 1982
* 28th-best of 37 in 1993
* 30th-best of 38 in 2003
* 27th-best of 38 in 2008
* 28th-best of 38 in 2014

<text>Anna Tuthill Harrison (&quot;née&quot; Symmes; July 25, 1775 – February 25, 1864) was the first lady of the United States in 1841 as the wife of President William Henry Harrison. She served in the role for only one month, as her husband contracted pneumonia and died shortly after his term began. Their son John Scott Harrison was the father of President Benjamin Harrison. She never entered the White House during her tenure as first lady, remaining the only presidential wife to never visit the capital during her husband&#x27;s presidency. At age 65 when her husband&#x27;s presidential term began, Harrison was the oldest woman ever to assume the role of first lady, a record held until Jill Biden became first lady at age 69 in 2021. She also has the distinction of holding the title for the shortest length of time, and the first first lady to be widowed while holding the title. Harrison was the last first lady to have been born before the inauguration of George Washington. She was the only First Lady of the United States to have been the wife of one U.S. President and the grandmother of another U.S. President.

Anna was raised by her grandparents on Long Island and given an education better than any other first lady had yet received. She married military officer William Henry Harrison against her father&#x27;s wishes in 1795, and she raised their family of ten children in the frontier of Ohio and Indiana while William pursued a political career. Eight of Anna&#x27;s ten children died in her lifetime, causing her to become more deeply involved in her Presbyterian faith. She became first lady when William became president in 1841, though she did not attend his inauguration. William died while Anna was preparing to travel to Washington, D.C., only one month into his term. Anna lived the remainder of her life in Ohio, first in their family log cabin, and then with her only surviving son. Her short tenure as first lady, her absence from the White House, and the destruction of her personal papers in a fire have caused her to be overlooked by historians, and her life has been the subject of relatively little scholarly analysis.

==Early life==
Anna Tuthill Symmes was born on July 25, 1775, in Morristown, New Jersey, as the second child of Anna Tuthill and John Cleves Symmes. Her father was an associate justice on the Supreme Court of New Jersey. Her mother died on her first birthday, leaving her father to raise her alone. When the American Revolutionary War began, John was a colonel in the Continental Army. To ensure his daughter&#x27;s safety, he assumed the guise of a British soldier and transported her to Long Island via horseback. Here she was raised by her maternal grandparents. One rumor suggested that John carried two bags: one with Anna, and one with turnips that he showed to any soldiers who questioned him, claiming that he was delivering them to the British commander.

As a child, Anna first attended Clinton Academy in East Hampton and then the private school of Isabella Graham in New York City. Her education was religious in nature, as her grandparents raised her to be a Presbyterian. Once the war ended in 1783, Anna&#x27;s father paid her a brief visit in New York before relocating to the Northwest Territory. She reunited with her father in 1794 at the age of 19 when she moved to the Northwest Territory to live with him in the town that he had established there: North Bend, Ohio. Also present was her stepmother, Susannah Livingston, with whom Anna got along well.

== Marriage and family ==
Symmes met William Henry Harrison during a visit to Lexington, Kentucky, to see her sister Maria. Despite her father&#x27;s disapproval, she began a courtship with him. Her father disapproved of the courtship because of Harrison&#x27;s military career. His experience with the soldiers of the Northwest Territory convinced him that they were little more than criminals, and he feared that Harrison&#x27;s lack of experience in any other field would make it difficult to provide for a family.

Symmes and Harrison decided to elope while her father was away on business. They were married on November 25, 1795, with Dr. Stephen Wood presiding. The ceremony may have been in the home of the presiding minister or at the home of Anna&#x27;s father; historians disagree on the exact location. Anna&#x27;s father was displeased, and weeks went by before he finally spoke to his new son-in-law, demanding to know how he would support a family with Anna. William responded that he would use his sword. John&#x27;s animosity toward William did not last. He eventually campaigned on his behalf and named him an executor of his estate.

Anna accompanied William when he returned to the nearby Fort Washington where he was stationed. She lived the traditional life of an army wife, including the associated travel with her husband. In 1798, William resigned from the army, purchased land in North Bend, and built a log cabin for their home. At this point they had their first child, who had been born in 1796. They eventually had ten children together over a period of 18 years. Nine of them preceded Anna in death.

==Husband&#x27;s rise to fame==
After William was elected to the House of Representatives in 1799, the family moved to Philadelphia, which was the capital of the United States at the time. Besides Philadelphia, they also spent time in Richmond, Virginia, to see William&#x27;s family. It was here that Anna had their third child in 1800. They moved to Vincennes, Indiana, later that year when William was appointed territorial governor of Indiana. After four years in Vincennes, William built Grouseland, a brick house for the Harrisons that also served as a popular location for the territory&#x27;s social events. Attacks on families by Native American soldiers sometimes occurred in the region, and the children were regularly forced to hide inside the home, which was built to be readily defensible. A Methodist minister lived with the Harrisons in Grouseland, and he guarded the house during attacks. While living in Vincennes, Anna sought whatever newspapers and journals she could, reading about various political topics. She felt lonely in Vincennes because of the distance from her extended family; the opportunity to meet visiting national figures provided little consolation. She had five more children during her time in Indiana.

Anna took her children to live with her father during the War of 1812, as William was again serving in the military. At this time she joined the First Presbyterian Church, and she had her ninth child. At the end of the war, the Harrisons moved their log cabin, the Bend, onto property in North Bend, which Anna had inherited from her father after his death in 1814. William had retired a war hero, attracting numerous guests to their home, including their church congregation, who were invited to dinner after services each Sunday morning. Their tenth and final child was born in 1814, but he died in 1817. This was the first of several early deaths among their children: a daughter Lucy died in 1826, and their son William died in 1830, followed by the deaths of three more sons in 1838, 1839, and 1840.

Anna spent much of the 1810s and 1820s alone, as William had a successful political career that took him to the United States Congress, the Ohio Senate, and the diplomatic mission to Colombia. She educated their children, eventually founding a school in North Bend. Religious education was handled by a circuit rider. The Harrisons were not efficient with their budget, and their finances were further stressed by weddings and college tuition as their children grew. Another complication was that their son William had accumulated $12,000 () in debt, which they assumed when he died.

Anna was hesitant when her husband expressed an ambition to be president of the United States, and she was upset by his presidential runs in the 1836 and 1840 presidential elections. Despite her objections, she assisted in his campaigns, hosting as prospective supporters visited their home in North Bend. Her political knowledge was valuable during the campaigns, as she was able to converse with visiting politicians. Given her observance of the Sabbath, she convinced William to skip campaigning on Sundays. Her participation continued until the death of another of her sons in 1840.

==First Lady of the United States==
Harrison was displeased when her husband was elected president. She is quoted as saying &quot;I wish that my husband&#x27;s friends had left him where he is, happy and contented in retirement.&quot; At the age of 65, she was the oldest woman to that point to become first lady. In anticipation of her new position, she worried that she would be poorly received in Washington society and would be unable to fulfill the traditional responsibilities of a first lady. William was inaugurated as president in 1841, but Anna did not accompany him to Washington; she was feeling unwell, and the journey would involve harsh weather. She instead sent Jane Irwin Harrison, the widow of their late son, to serve as acting first lady. She prepared to join her husband the following May, but before she left, she received news that he had died of pneumonia. She chose not to make the journey, forgoing his state funeral.

==Later life and death==
Harrison returned to North Bend after her husband&#x27;s death. Though Harrison did not like her husband&#x27;s successor, President John Tyler, she lobbied him to give political appointments to members of her family, leveraging her status as a former first lady. She likewise lobbied the following president, James K. Polk, to give military commissions to her grandsons. Harrison was granted a pension by the federal government in June 1841, which she spent paying her late husband&#x27;s debts. Harrison became more involved in politics and religion in her later years. During the Civil War, she was a supporter of abolitionism, and she encouraged her grandsons to serve in the Union Army. In 1855, Harrison&#x27;s cabin was destroyed in a fire, and she spent her final years living with her son John. Harrison died on February 25, 1864, at the age of 88. She was buried beside her husband in North Bend. Her funeral sermon was preached by Horace Bushnell.

== Legacy ==
Harrison was the first woman widowed while first lady, and was followed by a long series of wives of presidents unwilling or unable to carry out the duties associated with the role. She did not develop a significant reputation as first lady, as her husband died before she arrived at the White House. Furthermore, her personal papers were destroyed by fire with her log cabin. For these reasons, Harrison and her performance as first lady have not been the subject of significant scholarly analysis or debate. Her historical image is primarily characterized by her devotion to religion and to family.

One subject of debate among historians is how much influence Harrison had over her husband; earlier presidential historians such as Laura Carter Holloway and argued that she had a strong command over her husband and his career, but more recent historians have contested this. One historian, Paul Boller, compared Harrison to Rachel Jackson: as both were wives of men that were often away on military and political duties, both wished for their husbands to retire from public life, and both used their Presbyterianism to cope with these struggles.

Harrison held several distinctions as first lady. She was the last first lady to be born before the inauguration of George Washington, and the first to receive a formal education. She was the oldest woman to become first lady at the time, doing so at the age of 65. She held this record until 2021, when Jill Biden became first lady at the age of 69. She also holds records due to her husband&#x27;s short term: she served the shortest tenure of any first lady, only holding the title for 31 days, and she is the only first lady to have never been to the capital during her husband&#x27;s presidency. Harrison&#x27;s grandson, Benjamin Harrison, became president of the United States in 1889, effectively making her the only woman to be both the wife of one U.S. president and the grandmother of another.

In the 1982 Siena College Research Institute survey asking historians to assess American first ladies; Harrison was included. The first ladies survey, which has been conducted periodically since, ranks first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. In the 1982 survey, out of 42 first ladies and acting first ladies, Harrison was assessed as the 23rd-highest regarded among historians. Due to the brevity of her time as first lady, Harrison has been excluded from subsequent iterations of the survey.

<doc id="416328" wikidata="Q1851281" url="?curid=416328" title="List of United States senators from Alabama">
<text>Alabama was admitted to the Union on December 14, 1819. The state elects U.S. senators to class 2 and class 3. Its United States Senate seats were declared vacant from March 1861 to July 1868 due to its secession from the Union during the American Civil War. Richard Shelby is Alabama&#x27;s longest serving senator (served 1987–2023). Alabama&#x27;s current U.S. senators are Republicans Tommy Tuberville (since 2021) and Katie Britt (since 2023).

== In fiction ==

&quot;They Shall Have Stars&quot;, the first volume in science fiction writer James Blish&#x27;s &quot;Cities in Flight&quot; series, was published in 1950 and is set in a fictional 2013. A major character is Alaska Senator Bliss Wagoner, head of the Joint Congressional Committee on Space Flight, who is depicted as playing a crucial role in Humanity&#x27;s spread into space. At the time of writing, Alaska was not yet a state and had no senators, but Blish correctly assumed that this would come about by 2013.

<doc id="416331" wikidata="Q1465908" url="?curid=416331" title="List of United States senators from Arkansas">
<text>Arkansas was admitted to the Union on June 15, 1836, and elects its senators to class 2 and class 3. Arkansas&#x27;s Senate seats were declared vacant in July 1861, due to its secession from the Union. They were again filled from June 1868. Its current senators are Republicans John Boozman and Tom Cotton. John L. McClellan was Arkansas&#x27;s longest-serving senator (1943–1977).

<doc id="416333" wikidata="Q1324449" url="?curid=416333" title="List of United States senators from Colorado">
<text>Colorado was admitted to the Union on August 1, 1876 and elects U.S. senators to Senate class 2 and class 3. 

Both of Colorado&#x27;s current U.S. senators are Democrats Michael Bennet (serving since 2009) and John Hickenlooper (serving since 2021). Colorado is one of sixteen states alongside California, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, and West Virginia, to have a younger senior senator and an older junior senator.
Henry M. Teller was Colorado&#x27;s longest-serving senator (1876–1882; 1885–1909).

<text>This is a chronological listing of the United States senators from [[Connecticut]].

United States senators are popularly elected, for a six-year term, beginning January 3. Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. Before 1914, they were chosen by the Connecticut General Assembly, and before 1935, their terms began March 4. Its current U.S. senators are Democrats Richard Blumenthal (serving since 2011) and Chris Murphy (serving since 2013). Chris Dodd is Connecticut&#x27;s longest-serving senator (1981–2011).

<text>Below is a chronological listing of the United States senators from Delaware. U.S. senators were originally elected by the Delaware General Assembly for designated six-year terms beginning March 4. Frequently portions of the term would remain only upon a U.S. senator&#x27;s death or resignation. From 1914 and the enforcement of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, adopted in 1913 but rejected by the General Assembly that year and not ratified until July 1, 2010, officeholders were popularly elected on the first Tuesday after November 1; starting 1935, the beginning of their term is January 3.

Delaware&#x27;s current U.S. senators are Democrats Chris Coons (serving since November 15, 2010) and Lisa Blunt Rochester (serving since January 3, 2025). Joe Biden is Delaware&#x27;s longest serving senator (1973–2009).

<text>Richard Sharpe Shaver (October 8, 1907 – November 5, 1975) was an American writer and artist who achieved notoriety in the years following World War II as the author of controversial stories which were printed in science fiction magazines (primarily &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;). Shaver claimed that he had personal experience of a sinister ancient civilization that harbored fantastic technology in caverns under the earth. The controversy stemmed from the claim by Shaver, and his editor and publisher Ray Palmer, that Shaver&#x27;s writings, whilst presented in the guise of fiction, were fundamentally true. Shaver&#x27;s stories were promoted by Ray Palmer as &quot;The Shaver Mystery&quot;.

During the last decades of his life, Shaver devoted himself to &quot;rock books&quot; – stones that he believed had been created by the advanced ancient races and were embedded with legible pictures and texts. He produced paintings allegedly based on the rocks&#x27; images and photographed them extensively, as well as writing about them. Posthumously, Shaver has gained a reputation as an artist; his paintings and photos have been exhibited in Los Angeles, New York and elsewhere.

==Before writing==
Following the death of his brother Taylor Victor Shaver, a writer, from pneunomia in 1934, Shaver was committed to the Ypsilanti State Hospital for mental health disorders by his wife, Sophie. He stayed at the hospital for nearly two years, with periodic visits home. During his hospitalization, Sophie also died, from electrocution in her baththub. Shaver was released from hospital to his parents&#x27; farm in Pennsylvania, but soon left and traveled around the Northeastern United States and Canada. He was arrested for stowing away on a merchant vessel in Newfoundland in December 1937, and in early 1938 he was deported from Canada and sent to Grafton State Hospital in Massachusetts. He was transferred to the Ionia State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Michigan later that year, where he remained for five years. He began writing the same year that he was discharged, in 1943.

==The Shaver Mystery==
During 1943, Shaver wrote a letter to &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; magazine. He claimed to have discovered an ancient language he called &quot;Mantong&quot;, a sort of Proto-Human language that was the source of all Earthly languages. In Mantong, each sound had a hidden meaning; by applying this formula to any word in any language, one could decode a secret meaning to any word, name or phrase. Editor Ray Palmer applied the Mantong formula to several words, and said he realized Shaver was on to something.

According to Palmer (in his autobiography &quot;The Secret World&quot;), Palmer wrote back to Shaver, asking how he had learned of Mantong. Shaver responded with an approximately 10,000-word document titled &quot;A Warning to Future Man&quot;. Shaver claimed to have worked in a factory where, in 1932, odd things began to occur. As Bruce Lanier Wright notes, Shaver &quot;began to notice that one of the welding guns on his job site, &#x27;by some freak of its coil&#x27;s field atunements&#x27;, was allowing him to hear the thoughts of the men working around him. More frighteningly, he then received the telepathic record of a torture session conducted by malevolent entities in caverns deep within the earth.&quot; According to Michael Barkun, Shaver offered inconsistent accounts of how he first learned of the hidden cavern world, but that the assembly line story was the &quot;most common version&quot;.

Shaver wrote of extremely advanced prehistoric races who had built cavern cities inside the Earth before abandoning Earth for another planet due to damaging radiation from the Sun. Those ancients also abandoned some of their own offspring here, a minority of whom remained noble and human &quot;Teros&quot;, while most degenerated over time into a population of mentally impaired s known as &quot;Deros&quot;—short for &quot;detrimental robots&quot;. Shaver&#x27;s &quot;robots&quot; were not mechanical constructs, but were robot-like due to their savage behavior.

These Deros still lived in the cave cities, according to Shaver, kidnapping surface-dwelling people by the thousands for meat or torture. With the sophisticated &quot;ray&quot; machinery that the great ancient races had left behind, they spied on people and projected tormenting thoughts and voices into our minds (reminiscent of schizophrenia&#x27;s &quot;influencing machines&quot; such as the air loom). Deros could be blamed for nearly all misfortunes, from minor &quot;accidental&quot; injuries or illnesses to airplane crashes and catastrophic natural disasters. Women especially were singled out for brutal treatment, including rape, and Mike Dash notes that &quot;[s]ado-masochism was one of the prominent themes of Shaver&#x27;s writings&quot;. Though generally confined to their caves, Shaver claimed that the Deros sometimes traveled with spaceships or rockets, and had dealings with equally evil extraterrestrial beings. Shaver claimed to possess first-hand knowledge of the Deros and their caves, insisting he had been their prisoner for several years.

Palmer edited and rewrote the manuscript, increasing the total word count to a novella length of 31,000. Palmer insisted that he did not alter the main elements of Shaver&#x27;s story, but that he only added an exciting plot so the story would not read &quot;like a dull recitation&quot;. Retitled &quot;I Remember Lemuria!&quot;; it was published in the March 1945 issue of &quot;Amazing&quot;. The issue sold out, and generated quite a response: Between 1945 and 1949, many letters arrived attesting to the truth of Shaver&#x27;s claims (tens of thousands of letters, according to Palmer). The correspondents claimed that they, too, had heard strange voices or encountered denizens of the Hollow Earth. One of the letters to &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; was from a woman who claimed to have gone into a deep subbasement of a Paris, France building via a secret elevator. After months of rape and other torture, the woman was freed by a benevolent Tero. Another letter claiming involvement with Deros came from Fred Crisman, later to gain notoriety for his role in the Maury Island Incident and the John F. Kennedy assassination. &quot;Shaver Mystery Club&quot; societies were created in several cities. The controversy gained some notice in the mainstream press at the time, including a mention in a 1951 issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

Palmer claimed that &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; magazine had a great increase of circulation because of the Shaver Mystery, and the magazine emphasized the Shaver Mystery for several years. Barkun notes that, by any measure, the Shaver Mystery was successful in increasing sales of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. There was disagreement as to the precise increase in circulation, but Barkun notes that reliable sources reflect an increase in monthly circulation from about 135,000 to 185,000.

From 1945 to 1948, Barkun notes that about 75% of the issues of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; featured Shaver Mystery content, sometimes to the near-exclusion of any other topic. Historian Mike Dash declares that &quot;Shaver&#x27;s tales were amongst the wildest ever spun, even in the pages of the pulp science fiction magazines of the period&quot;. He also published in &quot;Other Worlds&quot; magazine; the first issue featured his story &quot;The Fall of Lemuria&quot;.

Many science fiction fans felt compelled to condemn the Shaver Mystery as &quot;the Shaver Hoax&quot;. These fans, already distressed by Palmer&#x27;s shift away from the literary or hard science fiction of earlier years to often slapdash space operas, organized letter-writing campaigns to try to persuade the publishers of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; to cease all Shaver Mystery articles. In fact, Palmer printed a number of critical or skeptical letters sent to &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, and he and other contributors occasionally rebutted or replied to such letters in print. As Bruce Lanier Wright notes, &quot;[t]he young Harlan Ellison, later a famously abrasive writer, allegedly badgered [Palmer] into admitting that the Shaver Mystery was a &#x27;publicity grabber&#x27;; when the story came out, Palmer angrily responded that this was hardly the same thing as calling it a hoax&quot;. Dash writes that the &quot;critics of the &#x27;Shaver Mystery&#x27; were quick to point out that its author was suffering from several of the classic symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia, and that many of the letters pouring into &quot;Amazing&quot; recounting personal experiences that backed up the author&#x27;s stories patently came from the sorts of people who would otherwise spend their time claiming that they were being persecuted by invisible voices or their neighbor&#x27;s dog&quot;.

During 1948, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; ceased all publication of Shaver&#x27;s stories. Palmer would later claim the magazine was pressured by sinister outside forces to make the change; science fiction fans would credit their boycott and letter-writing campaigns for the change. The magazine&#x27;s owners said later that the Shaver Mystery had simply run its course and sales were decreasing.

The Shaver Mystery Clubs had surprising longevity: Representatives of a club discussed the Shaver Mystery on John Nebel&#x27;s popular radio show several times through the late 1950s. Nebel said he thought the discussion was entertaining, but in extant recordings he was also skeptical about the entire subject.

Even after the pulp magazines lost popularity, Palmer continued promoting the Shaver Mystery to a diminishing audience via the periodical &quot;The Hidden World&quot;. Lanier describes the magazine as &quot;Shaver in the raw&quot; with little of Palmer&#x27;s editing. Shaver and his wife produced the &quot;Shaver Mystery Magazine&quot; irregularly for some years.

==Rock books==
During the 1960s and 1970s, now living in obscurity, Shaver searched for physical evidence of the bygone prehistoric races. He claimed to find it in certain rocks, which he believed were &quot;rock books&quot; that had been created by the great ancients and embedded with legible pictures and texts. For years, he wrote about the rock books, photographed them and made paintings of the images he found in them to demonstrate their historic importance. He even ran a &quot;rock book&quot; lending library through the mail, sending a slice of polished agate with a detailed description of what writings, drawings and photographs he claimed were archived by Atlanteans inside the stone using special laser-like devices.

Shaver never succeeded in generating much attention for his later findings during his lifetime, but there have been exhibits of Shaver&#x27;s art and photographs in the years since his death. Artist Brian Tucker created an exhibition about Shaver&#x27;s life and work in 1989 at California Institute of the Arts, and presented Shaver&#x27;s work again in later years at the Santa Monica Museum of Art and the Guggenheim Gallery of Chapman University in Orange County, California. In 2009, Tucker curated &quot;Mantong and Protong&quot;, an exhibition at Pasadena City College which pairs Shaver&#x27;s work with that of Stanislav Szukalski. Shaver&#x27;s art has also been exhibited in galleries in New York City and in a traveling exhibition of &quot;outsider photography&quot; called &quot;Create and Be Recognized&quot; that originated at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco in 2004. In that exhibition, which toured the U.S., Shaver&#x27;s &quot;rock book&quot; photography was grouped with works by famous &quot;outsider artists&quot;, including Henry Darger and Adolf Wolfli.

==Influence and references to the Shaver Mystery==
After its initial effect on the &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; readership, the Shaver Mystery continued to influence science fiction and other general literature. Many modern books, films, and games make references to Deros and other aspects of Shaver&#x27;s story. The Shaver Mystery has also influenced believers of paranormal phenomena. This has taken various forms, from suspected connections between the Deros and UFOs to appearances of the Deros in the mythology of the Church of the SubGenius.

===Shaver in science fiction, fantasy and horror===
As noted above, writer Harlan Ellison reportedly thought the Shaver Mystery was nonsense. However, he did use elements of the Shaver Mystery in one of his own science fiction short stories. &quot;From A to Z, in the Chocolate Alphabet&quot; featured 26 brief stories, some a few pages long, others comprising only a few sentences. One story, &quot;The Elevator People&quot;, reports that &quot;[t]here are five hundred buildings in the United States whose elevators go deeper than the basement&quot;. Those unfortunates who descend to the caverns emerge nearly catatonic after being &quot;treated&quot; by the evil cavern inhabitants.

The 2004 Japanese horror movie &quot;Marebito&quot;, directed by Takashi Shimizu, also references Shaver&#x27;s work and the Deros. The movie references Shaver&#x27;s books directly, as well as showing Deros at several times during the film.

Richard Shaver and the Deros are mentioned on a plaque in the video game &quot;Shivers&quot;, next to a sculpture of a Dero in the &quot;Subterranean World&quot; room.

Both Shaver and his work, as well as &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, are amongst the esoteric and unusual ideas referred to in the Philip K. Dick novel &quot;Confessions of a Crap Artist&quot;.

In the role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, which was heavily influenced by pulp and weird fiction in its development, there exists a race of evil subterranean dwarves called the derro, which were first described in the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; First Edition of &quot;Monster Manual II&quot;. These derro make raids on the surface to kidnap humans for use as slaves and food, and some among them, called Savants, possess magical and psychic powers, which they can use to influence people&#x27;s minds. They are said to have a main stronghold deep underground where they plot the overthrow of humanity.

Sociologist and occultist Carroll &quot;Poke&quot; Runyon produced a 2007 pseudo-documentary, &quot;Beyond Lemuria,&quot; relating subterranean Deros to interdimensional travel. Several of Runyon&#x27;s &quot;Hermetic Hour&quot; podcasts discuss the Shaver Mysteries.
The novel &quot;Tamper&quot;, by Bill Ectric, takes its name from Shaver&#x27;s description of the Deros&#x27; ability to tamper with the minds of humans with invisible rays. In the book, a boy obsessed with the &quot;Shaver Mystery&quot; begins to hear strange noises in his parents&#x27; basement which may or may not be real.

===Shaver and UFOs===

In the summer of 1947, Kenneth Arnold claimed to have seen some unusual flying objects near Mount Rainier. His report caused widespread interest in unidentified flying objects, and Palmer was quick to argue that the &quot;flying saucers&quot; were validation of the Shaver Mystery — for several years, he noted, Shaver had mentioned the Deros&#x27; supposed spaceships. The idea that Shaver and Palmer had somehow predicted or presaged the &quot;flying saucer&quot; craze was later championed by writer John Keel. His 1983 article &quot;The Man Who Invented Flying Saucers&quot; (first published in &quot;Fortean Times&quot;) declared that &quot;Palmer assigned artists to make sketches of objects described by readers and disc-shaped flying machines appeared on the covers of his magazine long before June 1947. So we can note that a considerable number of people — millions — were exposed to the flying saucer concept before the national news media were even aware of it. Anyone who glanced at the magazines on a newsstand and caught a glimpse of the saucer-emblazoned &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; cover had the image implanted in his subconscious&quot;.

However, UFO researcher Jerome Clark would argue just the contrary, writing that &quot;[i]t must be stressed that Palmer did not depict the deros&#x27; &#x27;rockets&#x27; as disc shaped. Nonetheless in later years, some would insist, with more hyperbole than reason, that through Shaver&#x27;s yarns Palmer &#x27;invented flying saucers&#x27;. In fact, Palmer&#x27;s influence beyond his relatively minuscule audience of science fiction fans and Forteans was nonexistent&quot;.

===Other influences===
The poet and folklorist Jesse Glass joined Shaver&#x27;s Atlantean Library in the early 1970s as a young man and briefly corresponded with him. He was intrigued by Shaver&#x27;s &quot;rock books&quot; with their accompanying descriptions, but noted that sometimes the surfaces of the stones seemed to be treated in some manner. One piece of stone looked like the surface was actually a drawing or rubbing on paper that had been heavily shellacked or somehow glued on. In fact, bits of white paper seemed to be showing through the shellac. Glass corresponded with Shaver and found him to be an intelligent and well-read correspondent until one day, out of the blue, the letters took on an abusive tone. It was then that Glass ended the correspondence.

The artist Jermaine Rogers has often used his version of the Deros in his many posters used to advertise rock music concerts. Rogers has approached the subject of the Deros with an ambiguity that some have taken as proof that he truly believes in these beings. Starting in 1994, Rogers&#x27; Dero has appeared in dozens of his posters and art prints and in 2004 it became a designer vinyl toy line.

Some aspects of the QAnon conspiracy theory have also been compared to Shaver’s ideas, particularly the theme of sadomasochistic abusive acts taking place in subterranean tunnels with the perpetrators also manipulating events on the surface world.

<text>Carla Estrada (born Carla Patricia Estrada Guitrón; March 11, 1956, in Mexico City, D.F., Mexico) is a Mexican television producer, one of the foremost telenovela producers of Latin America.

==Biography==
In 2005, the Mexican government decided to place a statue of the producer in one of Mexico City&#x27;s most important parks and in January 2007 she appeared on &quot;People En Español&quot;&#x27;s list of The 100 Most Influential Hispanics in the world. When aired in the United States, Estrada&#x27;s telenovela &quot;Amor Real&quot; shocked the world by having higher ratings than all of the other television shows in America; placing Univision on top of American networks such as NBC and ABC.

Estrada went to the UAM in Xochimilco to study psychology. She decided not to follow that career soon after, however, and she asked to have her major changed. Given a choice of new classes she could take, she chose communications, in part because her father was a journalist and her mother an actress.

Before graduating from the UAM in 1978, Estrada had already been hired by Televisa. She made history at Televisa by becoming the first woman producer in Mexican television history, but her beginnings were humble: at first, no celebrity wanted to work with her. Over the years this has changed, however, and she has produced some of Mexico&#x27;s (and Latin America&#x27;s) most famous soap operas, while working with such famous actors as Adamari López, Adela Noriega, Lucero, Fernando Colunga, Gabriela Roel and many more. Estrada was asked to produce soap operas for Televisa by Victor Hugo O&#x27;Farril. Her first soap opera was &quot;Pobre Juventud&quot;. Before that, she had been the producer of the teen-oriented show, &quot;Xe-Tu&quot;, where many superstars, such as Gloria Trevi, participated.

Estrada has spoken about the abuse she had to go through during the production of &quot;Pobre Juventud&quot;, both on the mental and physical aspect. According to her, she was subjected to mistreatment by her own employees, who went as far as hitting her on her legs with a cable once, because they were not used to having a woman boss.

She has often spoken about the importance of transmitting positive messages through her shows and her fascination towards love stories.

Carla Estrada is considered by many, including personal friend Cristina Saralegui, to be the greatest soap opera producer in Mexico, and her soap operas generally have wide international acceptance. One of her projects, &quot;Amor Real&quot;, was once watched by 59 percent of the Mexican audience.

<doc id="416343" wikidata="Q24790" url="?curid=416343" title="Letitia Christian Tyler">
<text>Letitia Christian Tyler ( Christian; November 12, 1790 – September 10, 1842) was the first lady of the United States from 1841 to 1842 as the first wife of President John Tyler. After meeting in 1808, the two married in 1813. She managed their plantation in Virginia while her husband progressed his political career at the state capital and in Washington, D.C., accompanying him only while he was governor of Virginia. She had a stroke in 1839 that left her permanently disabled.

Tyler became the second lady of the United States when her husband became vice president of the United States in 1841, and she became the first lady when President William Henry Harrison died the following month and her husband ascended to the presidency. Tyler was unable to perform the duties of first lady due to her health, delegating them to her daughter-in-law Priscilla Cooper Tyler. She died of a second stroke in 1842, becoming the first person to die while serving as first lady of the United States. Tyler played virtually no role in her husband&#x27;s presidency, but maintained a positive reputation among the American people.

==Early life==
Letitia Christian was born on November 12, 1790, at the Cedar Grove plantation in New Kent County, Virginia. She was the seventh child of Mary (née Browne) and Robert Christian, a wealthy planter who was well connected with the nation&#x27;s political elite, including President George Washington. She was raised as a devout Episcopalian, and she closely followed norms of the time relating to piety and chastity. Christian did not receive a formal education, but she was taught how to be the mistress of a Southern plantation.

The Christian and Tyler families were familiar with one another, and Christian met John Tyler while he was visiting in 1808. They began a courtship in which Tyler often stopped to visit her while traveling to the state capital. Their five-year courtship was restrained and it was three weeks before the wedding that Tyler first kissed her — on the hand. In his only surviving love letter to her, written a few months before their wedding, Tyler promised, &quot;Whether I float or sink in the stream of fortune, you may be assured of this, that I shall never cease to love you.&quot; Christian&#x27;s father opposed Tyler on political grounds, as Tyler was a supporter of Thomas Jefferson.

==Marriage and family==
Letitia Christian and John Tyler married at Cedar Grove on March 29, 1813. After their marriage, they lived in their home Mons-Sacer, built on Tyler family land in Greenway Plantation using Christian family funds; Letitia&#x27;s parents had died shortly after the wedding, leaving her a large inheritance. Letitia Tyler was left alone after the wedding, as her husband had been called up to serve in the War of 1812. Two years later, they sold Mons-Sacer and built the Woodburn house nearby before eventually purchasing Greenway in its entirety in 1821. The Tylers had nine children, seven of whom survived infancy: Mary in 1815, Robert in 1816, John III in 1819, Letitia in 1821, Elizabeth in 1823, Alice in 1827, and Tazewell in 1830.Their daughter Anne died in infancy in 1825, and a ninth unnamed child died at birth.

The Tylers struggled with money throughout their marriage, as the financial burdens of raising several children and participating in the social aspects of politics outpaced any inheritance they received. Tyler avoided the limelight during her husband&#x27;s political rise, preferring domestic responsibilities to those of a public wife. Tyler was responsible for managing the plantation while her husband was away at the Virginia State Capitol, often with the assistance of relatives and hired managers. Her management of the plantation, and in particular her ability to oversee the economic aspects, allowed her husband to be away for long periods of time, so his political career could progress. Managing the plantation included managing their slaves, feeding them and weaving their clothes. There is no surviving record of how Tyler felt about slavery or her husband&#x27;s ownership of slaves.

Tyler did accompany her husband while he served as the governor of Virginia. As the governor&#x27;s wife, she worked as a hostess in the state&#x27;s capital, Richmond. Despite her husband&#x27;s insistence, she did not join him in Washington when he was elected to the United States Congress. She opted to stay in Virginia, as the plantation needed further management and she did not wish to live in the poor conditions provided by Washington, D.C. She accompanied her husband to Washington only once, in the winter of 1828–1829. Tyler generally deferred to her husband, but she made one significant exception when he suggested sending their eldest daughter to a Catholic school, which Tyler adamantly refused.

Tyler&#x27;s health was poor throughout her life, and the Tylers&#x27; oldest child, Mary, was responsible for monitoring her when John was away. Tyler&#x27;s health was worsened by the toll of several pregnancies and the burden of her husband often being away. By 1827, her poor health had become a constant, and she was plagued by regular headaches. Attempts were made to treat her illness with trips to the Greenbrier spring. Her husband stepped away from politics twice, in 1821 and in 1836, to be closer to her.

The Tylers moved to Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1837. In 1839, Tyler had a stroke that left her disabled, and her health deteriorated over the following years. Most of her time after her stroke was spent reading the Bible and her prayer book. By this point in her life, these were the only two books that she would read. She did, however, continue to oversee affairs at the plantation. After her son Robert married, Tyler developed a close bond with her daughter-in-law Priscilla Cooper Tyler.

== First lady of the United States ==
The sudden death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841 caused John Tyler to ascend to the presidency. Letitia Tyler&#x27;s health had made it impossible for her to manage the White House, and she did not immediately travel to Washington with the rest of her family. When she did arrive, she remained in a wheelchair in the upstairs living quarters of the White House. She came down once, to attend the wedding of her daughter Elizabeth in January 1842. She may have attended the theater at least once while serving as first lady. While upstairs, she continued to spend her time reading her Bible and her prayer book.

Although she retained authority over how the duties of the first lady were carried out, Tyler delegated the management of the White House to her daughter Letitia and her responsibilities as hostess to her daughter-in-law Priscilla. She also played the role of advisor for her husband as he often discussed difficult issues of the presidency with her. She was well-versed enough in political issues to discuss them in detail with visitors. Distinguished visitors to the White House, such as Charles Dickens and Washington Irving, were sometimes welcomed upstairs to meet her.

Tyler&#x27;s physical and mental health deteriorated throughout 1842. She had a second stroke on September 9, 1842, and she died the following day on September 10. Her death came as a shock to the Tyler family, who believed that she had stabilized. She was the first woman to die while serving as first lady of the United States, and she remains the shortest-lived of any American first lady, dying at the age of 51. Her funeral was widely publicized as the first of an incumbent first lady. Her coffin lay in state in the East Room of the White House, then a procession carried her coffin away. Tyler was buried on her father&#x27;s estate at Cedar Grove, and the White House was decorated in black for a period of mourning.

==Legacy==

Tyler had little influence on her husband&#x27;s presidency, confined to the White House living quarters. She also played no public role, but she maintained a positive reputation despite her husband&#x27;s embattled political situation. Priscilla Cooper Tyler remembered her as &quot;the most entirely unselfish person you can imagine. Notwithstanding her very delicate health, mother attends to and regulates all the household affairs and all so quietly that you can&#x27;t tell when she does it.&quot;

The first historian&#x27;s appraisal of Tyler&#x27;s tenure as first lady was that of Laura Holloway in 1870. Few primary sources exist regarding Tyler&#x27;s life, with most surviving mentions of her being those in letters between members of the Tyler family. None of Tyler&#x27;s own letters survive. Due to her inability to serve as first lady, Tyler has been overshadowed in recent historical analysis by her surrogate, Priscilla Cooper Tyler, and her husband&#x27;s second wife, Julia Gardiner Tyler.

Tyler was a descendant of Manx settlers of Virginia and she appears on a 28p (£0.28) commemorative postage stamp from the Isle of Man Post Office, issued May 23, 2006, as part of a series honoring Manx-Americans. She also appears on a one-half-ounce gold coin and a bronze medal issued by the United States Mint on July 2, 2009, as part of a series of commemorative first spouse coins.

Since 1982, Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. Historians were found to know &quot;almost nothing about&quot; Tyler. Consistently, she has been ranked in the bottom quartile of first ladies by historians in these surveys. In terms of cumulative assessment, Tyler has been ranked:
*35th of 42 in 1982
*30th of 37 in 1993
*34th of 38 in 2003
*35th of 38 in 2008
*37th of 39 in 2014

In the 2014 survey, Tyler and her husband were ranked the 36th out of 39 first couples in terms of being a &quot;power couple&quot;.

<doc id="416351" wikidata="Q1049881" url="?curid=416351" title="Retinoschisis">
<text>Retinoschisis is an eye disease characterized by the abnormal splitting of the retina&#x27;s neurosensory layers, usually in the outer plexiform layer. Retinoschisis can be divided into degenerative forms which are very common and almost exclusively involve the peripheral retina and hereditary forms which are rare and involve the central retina and sometimes the peripheral retina. The degenerative forms are asymptomatic and involve the peripheral retina only and do not affect the visual acuity. Some rarer forms result in a loss of vision in the corresponding visual field.

Almost all cases are X-linked recessive and caused by a mutation in the retinoschisin gene (&quot;RS1&quot;).

==Classification==

*Hereditary
**X linked juvenile retinoschisis
**Familial foveal retinoschisis
*Tractional
*Exudative
**Secondary to optic disc pit
*Degenerative
**Typical
**Reticular

===Degenerative retinoschisis===

This type of retinoschisis is very common with a prevalence of up to 7 percent in normal persons. Its cause is unknown. It can easily be confused with retinal detachment by the non-expert observer and in difficult cases even the expert may have difficulty differentiating the two. Such differentiation is important since retinal detachment almost always requires treatment while retinoschisis never itself requires treatment and leads to retinal detachment (and hence to visual loss) only occasionally. Unfortunately one still sees cases of uncomplicated retinoschisis treated by laser retinopexy or cryopexy in an attempt to stop its progression towards the macula. Such treatments are not only ineffective but unnecessarily risk complications. There is no documented case in the literature of degenerative retinoschisis itself (as opposed to the occasional situation of retinal detachment complicating retinoschisis) in which the splitting of the retina has progressed through the fovea. There is no clinical utility in differentiating between typical and reticular retinoschisis. Degenerative retinoschisis is not known to be a genetically inherited condition.
There is always vision loss in the region of the schisis as the sensory retina is separated from the ganglion layer. But as the loss is in the periphery, it goes unnoticed. It is the very rare schisis that encroaches on the macula where retinopexy is then properly used.

===Hereditary retinoschisis===

Hereditary retinoschisis is derived from a defective retinoschisin protein, which is due to an X-linked genetic defect. The genetic form of this disease usually starts during childhood and is called X-linked Juvenile Retinoschisis (XLRS) or Congenital Retinoschisis. Affected males are usually identified in grade school, but occasionally are identified as young infants.

It is estimated that this much less common form of retinoschisis affects one in 5,000 to 25,000 individuals, primarily young males. &quot;Schisis&quot; is derived from the Greek word meaning &quot;splitting&quot;, describing the splitting of the retinal layers from each other. However, &quot;schisis&quot; is a word fragment, and the term &quot;retinoschisis&quot; should be used, as should the term &quot;iridoschisis&quot; when describing splitting of the iris. If the retinoschisis involves the macula, then the high-resolution central area of vision used to view detail is lost, and this is one form of macular disease. Although it might be described by some as a &quot;degeneration&quot;, the term &quot;macular degeneration&quot; should be reserved for the specific disease &quot;age-related macular degeneration&quot;.

Very few affected individuals go completely blind from retinoschisis, but some sufferers have very limited reading vision and are &quot;legally blind&quot;. Visual acuity can be reduced to less than 20/200 in both eyes. Individuals affected by XLRS are at an increased risk for retinal detachment and eye hemorrhage, among other potential complications.

Retinoschisis causes acuity loss in the center of the visual field through the formation of tiny cysts in the retina, often forming a &quot;spoke-wheel&quot; pattern that can be very subtle. The cysts are usually only detectable by a trained clinician. In some cases vision cannot be improved by glasses, as the nerve tissue itself is damaged by these cysts.

The National Eye Institute (NEI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting clinical and genetic studies of X-Linked Juvenile Retinoschisis. This study began in 2003 and as of 2018 is continuing to recruit patients. A better understanding of why and how XLRS develops might lead to improved treatments. Males diagnosed with X-linked juvenile retinoschisis and females who are suspected carriers may be eligible to participate. In addition to giving a medical history and submitting medical records, participants submit a blood sample and the NEI will perform a genetic analysis. There is no cost to participate in this study.

===Tractional retinoschisis===

This may be present in conditions causing traction on the retina especially at the macula. This may occur in:
a) The vitreomacular traction syndrome; b) Proliferative diabetic retinopathy with vitreoretinal traction; c) Atypical cases of impending macular hole.

===Exudative retinoschisis===

Retinoschisis involving the central part of the retina secondary to an optic disc pit was erroneously considered to be a serous retinal detachment until correctly described by Lincoff as retinoschisis. Significant visual loss may occur and following a period of observation for spontaneous resolution, treatment with temporal peripapillary laser photocoagulation followed by vitrectomy and gas injection followed by face-down positioning is very effective in treating this condition.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of the disease is usually made during an examination of the back of the eye (fundus) where any splits, tears or rips may be seen. One diagnostic tool is optical coherence tomography (OCT), which uses light waves to create images of the retina and based on ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression and contact lens examination. The fellow eye should also be examined.

==Treatment==
Retinoschisis usually does not require treatment aside from glasses to improve vision . However, some children with X-linked retinoschisis may have bleeding in their eye. This can be treated with either laser therapy or cryosurgery. In rare cases, children may need surgery to stop the bleeding.

=== Gene therapy ===
As of 2022, a clinical trial of gene therapy to treat XLRS was ongoing. After 1 year, the paper concluded that the therapy &quot;was generally safe and well tolerated but failed to demonstrate a measurable treatment effect&quot; and a 5-year follow up will be conducted to assess long-term safety.

=== Gene editing ===
There may be various gene editing techniques to possibly treat hereditary retinoschisis.

<text>Florida was admitted to the Union on March 3, 1845, and elects its U.S. senators to class 1 and class 3. Florida&#x27;s U.S. Senate seats were declared vacant in March 1861, due to its secession from the Union. They were filled again in July 1868. The state is currently represented by Rick Scott (serving since 2019) and Ashley Moody (serving since 2025). Duncan U. Fletcher was Florida&#x27;s longest-serving senator (1909–1936).

<doc id="416355" wikidata="Q501431" url="?curid=416355" title="List of United States senators from Georgia">
<text>Georgia was admitted to the Union on January 2, 1788. The state has had senators since the 1st Congress. Its Senate seats were declared vacant in March 1861 owing to its secession from the Union. They were again filled from February 1871.

United States senators are popularly elected to six-year terms that begin on January 3 of the year after their election. Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. Before 1914, Georgia&#x27;s senators were chosen by the Georgia General Assembly, and before 1935, their terms began March 4. Popular Senate elections remained despite the General Assembly not taking action to ratify the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution that was passed in 1913.

Rebecca Latimer Felton was the first female U.S. senator, representing Georgia in the Senate for one day in 1922, having been appointed to the seat to replace Thomas E. Watson after his death in September 1922.

Richard Russell Jr. was the state&#x27;s longest serving senator, served from 1933 to 1971.

Since January 20, 2021, Georgia has been represented in the Senate by Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. Ossoff defeated Republican David Perdue in the regularly-scheduled 2020 election, while Warnock defeated appointed Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler in the concurrent special election, both of which were decided in runoffs on January 5, 2021. Ossoff is the first Jewish senator from Georgia and Warnock the first black senator from Georgia.

Georgia is one of fourteen states alongside California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Utah to have a younger senior senator and an older junior senator.

<text>Julia Gardiner Tyler ( Gardiner; May 4, 1820 – July 10, 1889) was the first lady of the United States from June 26, 1844, to March 4, 1845, as the second wife of President John Tyler. A member of the influential Gardiner family, she had many notable figures as suitors. She met the recently widowed President Tyler in 1842, and she agreed to marry him after he comforted her in the aftermath of her father&#x27;s death. They married in secret, and she became first lady immediately upon their marriage, serving in the role for the final eight months of his presidency.

Tyler was delighted with her role as first lady, redecorating the White House and establishing her own &quot;court&quot; of ladies-in-waiting to mimic the practices of European monarchies she had visited years before. She also established the tradition of playing &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; when the president arrived at an event, and she popularized the waltz and polka dances in the United States. Tyler was a fierce advocate for her husband&#x27;s political priorities, organizing social events to lobby Congressmen, particularly for the Texas annexation. She is credited with revitalizing the position of first lady, both socially and politically, after several inactive first ladies before her.

After leaving the White House, Tyler moved to the Sherwood Forest Plantation in Virginia with her husband and had seven children. She became a prominent supporter of slavery in the United States, writing an influential pamphlet in 1853 that defended the practice. During the American Civil War, she provided support to the Confederate States of America, creating a permanent rift with her family in New York. After the war, she was involved in a legal dispute regarding her mother&#x27;s estate with her brother, who had been a loyal Unionist. Tyler returned to Washington in the 1870s as her reputation recovered, assisting first lady Julia Grant at the White House and convincing Congress to provide a pension for widowed first ladies. She spent her final years in Richmond, Virginia, where she lived in poor health. She died of a stroke on July 10, 1889, in the same hotel where her husband had died from the same illness 27 years before.

==Early life==

Julia Gardiner was born on May 4, 1820, on Gardiner&#x27;s Island in New York. She was the daughter of David Gardiner, a landowner and New York State senator (1824–1828), and Juliana MacLachlan Gardiner. Her ancestry was Dutch, Scottish, and English, and she was the third of four children. The Gardiners were a wealthy and influential family, and she was taught to value social class and advantageous marriages. She was educated at home until she was 16 years old, and she then attended the Chagaray Institute in New York, where she studied music, French literature, ancient history, arithmetic, and composition. She was raised as a Presbyterian.

As a young woman Gardiner closely followed fashions. She was introduced in Saratoga Springs, New York at the age of 15. In 1840, she shocked polite society by appearing in an advertisement for a department store, posed with an unidentified man and identified as &quot;The Rose of Long Island&quot;. Her family took her to Europe, possibly to avoid further publicity, while the nickname &quot;Rose of Long Island&quot; became permanently associated with Gardiner. They first left for London, arriving on October 29, 1840. They visited England, France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, and Scotland before returning to New York in September 1841. While in France, she was presented to the French court, adding to her list of suitors. After returning from Europe, the Gardiners spent time in Washington, D.C.

== Courtship and wedding ==
=== Courtship with President Tyler ===
In Washington, Gardiner and her sister Margaret accumulated so many suitors that an extra room had to be rented to entertain them. She continued to make visits to Washington over the following years. She received marriage proposals from several prominent figures, including two congressmen and a Supreme Court justice. She also received such proposals from President John Tyler.

She first met Tyler in January 1842, when she was introduced to him at a White House reception. On Gardiner&#x27;s request, her family spent more time in Washington, returning in 1843. President Tyler invited Gardiner to a private game of cards on February 7, 1843, after which he playfully chased her around the tables. After the death of his first wife, Letitia Christian Tyler, Tyler made it clear that he wished to be romantically involved with Gardiner. Though the Gardiner and Tyler families grew closer, Julia initially felt little attraction to the president, who was 30 years her senior. The increased time that Gardiner and President Tyler spent together prompted public speculation about their relationship. Tyler first proposed to her at a White House Masquerade Ball on February 22, 1843, when she was 22 years old. She refused that and later proposals he made, though they reached an understanding by the following month that they would someday be wed.

On February 22, 1844, Gardiner, her sister Margaret, and her father joined a presidential excursion on the new steam frigate &quot;Princeton&quot;. During this excursion, her father, David Gardiner, along with others, lost his life in the explosion of a huge naval gun called the &quot;Peacemaker&quot;. Gardiner is said to have fainted after learning of her father&#x27;s death, having President Tyler carry her off the ship. While she grieved for her father, even Gardiner acknowledged that the president had become a surrogate father. She became much more receptive to his advances over the following weeks, and she agreed to marry him.

=== Wedding of Julia Gardiner and John Tyler ===
It was decided that the wedding of Gardiner and Tyler would be carried out in secret. They were wed on June 26, 1844, at the Church of the Ascension in New York. The wedding was controversial when it was announced to the public. It was the first time that a president had married while holding the office, and critics felt that it was inappropriate for him to remarry while he was president, so shortly after the death of his first wife. Their age difference was also a subject of criticism: President Tyler was 54 years old, while Gardiner was 24. Some, such as Congressman and former President John Quincy Adams, mocked the president for marrying a young bride so soon after meeting her. Julia Tyler&#x27;s new stepchildren were dismayed by the marriage, especially as some of them were older than she and it was so soon after their mother&#x27;s death. Her stepdaughters in particular were distrustful, though she was ultimately accepted by all of them with the exception of Letitia Semple. After her marriage, Tyler determined that she would give up being a New Yorker and identify instead as a Virginian like her husband.

==First Lady of the United States==
=== White House hostess ===
As the wife of the president, Julia Tyler served as first lady of the United States for the final eight months of his presidency. After their marriage, they honeymooned in Washington, Old Point Comfort, and the president&#x27;s privately owned Sherwood Forest Plantation. Tyler was enthralled by the crowds that followed them and the public interest in their secret wedding. After arriving at the White House, she sought to make the presidential home more extravagant; she had the building cleaned, the furniture replaced, and the staff uniforms updated. Access to the Gardiner family fortune allowed her to remake the White House more than would have otherwise been possible. She also purchased many elaborate dresses at personal expense, becoming a prominent influence in fashion. The extravagance was muted, however, by her period of mourning for her father.

Tyler&#x27;s sister Margaret assisted her while visiting Washington, serving as a social secretary. Tyler became a point of contact for those wishing to receive favors from the president, and the Gardiner family in particular regularly sought support from the first lady. Among her favorite requests were those for pardons and commutations by the president, and it was Tyler&#x27;s interjection that spared a convict, &quot;Babe&quot; the pirate, from a death sentence in New York. Tyler was often the subject of human-interest stories, particularly those by Washington correspondent F. W. Thomas of the &quot;New York Herald&quot;. Thomas&#x27; coverage of her was consistently positive, and he bestowed upon her the nickname &quot;Lady Presidentress,&quot; with which she was popularly identified.

=== Political influence ===
Tyler did not have strong political views of her own. Rather, she adopted and defended those of her husband. She encouraged her husband to pursue whatever policies he desired, and she would even flatter members of the Senate to win their support. Political considerations were always factored into social events, and Tyler used her influence to exert power in her own right. In particular, she lobbied for the annexation of Texas as she believed it would benefit her husband&#x27;s legacy. Her open expression of political opinion diverged from previous first ladies, who generally expressed little interest in politics. After the president signed off on the annexation of Texas in one of his final official acts, Tyler began wearing the pen he used around her neck. Her lobbying on the Texas issue is credited as a major factor in its success. Her support for the annexation of Texas became publicly known to the point where she was identified with the topic, and it was the subject of the first political cartoon to tie a first lady to a political issue.

=== Public image ===
As first lady, Tyler wished to emulate the customs of European courts. She had her own court formed from her sister, her cousins, and her daughter-in-law, who served as her ladies-in-waiting, and she invited ladies of prominent families to join her at events and receiving lines. She also kept an Italian Greyhound that accompanied her, which the president had ordered for her from Naples. Her sense of extravagance was also noted when she drove four horses and when she received guests on an armchair that was slightly elevated. To bring an element of grandiose to the presidency, she began the tradition of a presidential anthem, having &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; played to announce the entry of the president.

Tyler broke social norms by dancing in public, which was considered scandalous by the country&#x27;s Puritan tradition. Her love for the polka helped popularize the dance in the United States. She also introduced the waltz to White House events despite the president&#x27;s previous opposition to dancing. Several &quot;Julia Waltzes&quot; were written in her honor and saw wide success. Though Tyler was generally popular as first lady, her love of drinking and dancing earned her the ire of religious citizens amidst the Second Great Awakening. In the last month of her husband&#x27;s administration, Tyler hosted a grand White House ball for 3,000 guests.

==Post-presidency==

=== Motherhood at Sherwood Forest Plantation ===

After leaving the White House, the Tylers retired to the Sherwood Forest Plantation. Although a Northerner by birth, Tyler adopted her new Southern identity wholeheartedly, saying that she was &quot;ashamed&quot; of New York. The Tylers had seven children together after leaving the White House: David Gardiner Tyler in 1846, John Alexander Tyler in 1848, Julia Gardiner Tyler in 1849, Lachlan Tyler in 1851, Lyon Gardiner Tyler in 1853, Robert Fitzwalter Tyler in 1856, and Pearl Tyler in 1860.

Tyler was responsible for the care of not only her seven children, but several of her adult stepchildren, their two hired workers, and approximately 70 slaves who were made to work on the plantation. Tyler often hosted social gatherings and long-term guests at their home, and the family regularly traveled throughout the United States for vacation and for speaking engagements. She also carried out renovations on their home, their boat, and their carriage. Tyler eventually bought the Villa Margaret summer home in Hampton, Virginia to accommodate their growing family. The Tylers spent beyond their means, depleting the Gardiner fortune and plunging them into financial trouble for much of their marriage.

When several women of the British aristocracy published an open letter challenging slavery in the Southern United States, Tyler wrote a response that defended slavery, publishing it in the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; in 1853. In this response, Tyler made several false claims to suggest that slaves lived comfortably in the United States. Such a public expression of political opinion was unusual for a woman in the Southern United States, but the nature of the slavery debate won acceptance for her essay among the South. In the North, she was regarded as a doughface, a disparaging term for a Northerner that supported the South. In response to Tyler&#x27;s essay, Harriet Jacobs, a former slave and later abolitionist writer, authored her first published work, a letter to the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; in 1853.

=== Civil War ===
Though their allegiance was with the South, the Tylers did not want the Southern states to secede in the buildup to the Civil War. They went to Washington in early 1861 to alleviate the crisis, with Tyler involving herself in the city&#x27;s social life to help improve Northern–Southern relations. By February, however, Tyler and her husband accepted secession and aligned themselves with the Confederate States of America. She volunteered to support the Confederate war effort during the civil war, and she cut ties with her family in New York when they remained loyal to the Union. She became further opposed to the Union after Union soldiers captured her summer home Villa Margaret.

When a nightmare caused her to worry for her husband&#x27;s health while he was away, Tyler joined him at the Confederate House of Representatives in Richmond, Virginia. He died of a stroke on January 18, 1862, at the age of 71, days after she arrived. Tyler hired a manager and two employees to tend to Sherwood Forest Plantation. Then with her two youngest children, she traveled to Bermuda where she lived with other Confederates who had settled there, and she returned to her family home in New York in November 1862 She bitterly argued with her Unionist brother, who was eventually banished from the house after striking her. Tyler was upset to hear that Sherwood Forest Plantation had been captured while she was in New York, that her former slaves had been given the crops that they grew, and that the building was being used as a desegregated school.

Tyler continued to support the Confederacy throughout the war, making donations to the Confederate Army and distributing pamphlets in support of the cause. The day after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865, three men broke into her home demanding that she turn over her Confederate flag, searching for it after she denied having one. She suspected her brother of orchestrating the attack. The Tylers remained unpopular after the war for supporting the Confederacy, so the Tyler children were sent out of the country for schooling.

=== Later life and death ===

Tyler&#x27;s mother died in October 1864, writing a new will while she was on her deathbed. Tyler&#x27;s brother challenged the will, arguing that Tyler had exerted &quot;undue influence&quot; over their mother. The dispute was resolved in 1868, when she was granted the Gardiner-Tyler House in Staten Island and three-eighths of the family&#x27;s property in New York City. She moved into the Gardiner-Tyler House and lived there until 1874. Tyler was also involved in a separate legal battle to regain her summerhouse Villa Margaret, which she eventually won back in 1869. After trying to sell it to President Ulysses S. Grant, she was forced to sell Villa Margaret at a loss. 

Tyler resumed her social life in Washington in the 1870s as the stigma of her Confederate sympathies subsided. She sometimes attended White House events, supporting first lady Julia Grant as hostess. In 1870, Tyler donated a portrait of herself to the White House, starting the first ladies portrait collection. In 1872, Tyler moved to Georgetown. Seeking meaning later in life, she and her daughter Pearl converted from the Tyler family&#x27;s Episcopalianism to Roman Catholicism in 1872. The economic depression that followed the Panic of 1873 depleted her finances, forcing her to sell her other properties so she could purchase Sherwood Forest Plantation back from the Bank of Virginia that had come to control it. She lobbied Congress for a pension and was granted a monthly allowance in 1880. Following the assassination of President James Garfield in 1881, Congress granted an annual pension of $5,000 to widows of former presidents.
In 1882, Tyler moved to Richmond, Virginia. Toward the end of her life, she suffered from malaria. She made her final visit to Washington in 1887, when she met with first lady Frances Cleveland, to whom she would sometimes provide advice. Tyler suffered a stroke and died on July 10, 1889, while she was staying at the Exchange Hotel—the same hotel where her husband had died of a stroke 27 years before. She was buried next to him at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. Tyler had lived the longest post-White House life of any first lady, living another 44 years after leaving the White House. She held this record until it was overtaken by Frances Cleveland.

==Legacy==
The papers of the Tyler family, including Julia Gardiner Tyler, are held by the Special Collections Research Center at the College of William and Mary. Tyler&#x27;s son Lyon, like his father, married his second wife late in life. As a result, Julia Tyler had two grandsons who survived into the 21st century: one died in September 2020, while Harrison Ruffin Tyler was still alive as of that date.

Tyler was generally well received during her time as first lady, and she is credited with revitalizing social life in Washington after the death of her husband&#x27;s first wife. She also provided a level of extravagance to the presidency, but she did little to change or expand the substance of the role of first lady. Instead, she strongly affected the role&#x27;s imagery, incorporating regal elements. She is recognized as one of the most successful hostesses in the history of the White House due to her charm and the grandiosity of her parties, and she was one of the earliest first ladies to be directly active in politics. Her prominence in Washington has prompted greater historical interest in her life compared to the less active presidential wives that immediately preceded her.

=== Regard by historians ===
Since 1982 Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. Consistently, Tyler has been ranked in the lower half of first ladies by historians in these surveys. In terms of cumulative assessment, Tyler has been ranked:
*27th of 42 in 1982
*27th of 37 in 1993
*26th of 38 in 2003
*28th of 38 in 2008
*27th of 39 in 2014

In the 2014 survey, Tyler and her husband were ranked the 34th out of 39 first couples in terms of being a &quot;power couple&quot;.

<doc id="416359" wikidata="Q62604" url="?curid=416359" title="List of United States senators from Hawaii">
<text>Hawaii was admitted to the Union on August 21, 1959, and elects U.S. senators to classes 1 and 3. Seven people including only one Republican have served as a U.S. senator from Hawaii. The state&#x27;s current U.S. senators are Democrats Brian Schatz and Mazie Hirono. Hawaii&#x27;s class 1 seat is the only one in the United States that has always been held by an ethnic minority. Its class 3 seat is the only one in the United States that has always been held by a member of the Democratic Party. Hawaii is one of fifteen states alongside California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Utah to have a younger senior senator and an older junior senator.

Hawaii last elected a Republican in 1970, which has resulted in the longest streak in the nation for a state&#x27;s having all-Democratic senators. Daniel K. Inouye was Hawaii&#x27;s longest-serving senator, from 1963 to 2012.

<text>In the United States, special legislation is legislation that targets an individual or a small, identifiable group for treatment that does not apply to all the members of a given class. The expression &quot;special legislation&quot; is legal term of art. A statute is often called special legislation when it targets a named person, but the term can also be applied to legislation that singles out an association or corporation. Although a prototypical special law applies only to a single particular person or entity, legislation is often considered special when it applies to a small group of people or other entities.

Special legislation can be used to place burdens on or grant benefits to identifiable individuals. During the Confederation Period, bills of attainder, the most well-known type of special legislation, were enacted by state legislatures to punish individuals suspected, but neither charged nor convicted, of a crime. Special legislation was also used during that period to grant benefits to identifiable individuals, including monopoly rights and exemptions from generally applicable laws.

Legislatures still enact special laws that grant special burdens or provide special benefits to individuals; however, the most well-known type of special law, the bill of attainder, has largely disappeared. One recent group of state special laws grants special privileges to Tesla by permitting them to sell electric cars directly to consumers under circumstances that are prohibited to other consumers. Other modern special laws apply to a particular city or county. These laws are often called local laws.

Special laws are often criticized because they reflect the corruption of the legislative process, a lack of deliberation on the part of legislatures and because they lead to unjustifiably unequal treatment and allow the legislative branch to encroach on the powers of the executive and judicial branches. However, they are sometimes defended on the ground that they can address problems created by generally applicable laws or cure local problems that call for a local solution.

Most states have constitutional restrictions on some types of special laws. Most state constitutions prohibit special legislation related to certain enumerated subject matters, including prohibiting special laws granting divorces, changing names, and altering court rules. Most other state constitutions provide that the legislature may not pass special laws when a general law can be made applicable. A few states allow special legislation, but only of the legislature follows certain special procedures, like providing notice and a chance to object.

Under the United States Constitution, the modern Supreme Court has not recognized a constitutional prohibition on special legislation. Nevertheless, some scholars have argued that the text and historical background of the Constitution suggests that the Constitution should prohibit some types of special laws.

Special legislation is closely related to what in the United Kingdom are called special or private acts.

In Canada, the federal or provincial governments have the ability to introduce &quot;back-to-work legislation&quot;, which is a special law that blocks the strike action or lockout from happening or continuing. It can also impose binding arbitration or a new contract on the disputing parties. Such legislation was enacted during the 2011 Canada Post strike and the 2012 CP Rail strike, thus effectively ending these strikes as legal actions. On the provincial level, similar acts can be passed for other purposes; the National Assembly of Quebec enacted Act 78 in 2012 in order to quell a series of student protests.

<doc id="416361" wikidata="Q234285" url="?curid=416361" title="Sarah Childress Polk">
<text>Sarah Childress Polk (September 4, 1803 – August 14, 1891) was the first lady of the United States from 1845 to 1849. She was the wife of the 11th president of the United States, James K. Polk.

Well educated in a successful family, Sarah met her future husband at a young age. They never had children of their own, though they did foster relatives. Socially keen and well informed, Sarah helped her husband&#x27;s career with her hosting skills and advised him on political matters at times, though she stayed out of the public limelight. Following her husband&#x27;s death in 1849, Sarah had a 42-year widowhood, the longest of any First Lady.

==Early life and education==

Sarah Childress was born in 1803 to Elizabeth Whitsitt and Joel Childress, a prominent planter, merchant, and land speculator—the third of their six children. She was well educated for a woman of her time and place, attending the exclusive Moravians&#x27; Salem Academy in Winston-Salem, North Carolina in 1817, one of the few institutions of higher learning available to women in the early 19th century.

Sarah Childress met James K. Polk while both were receiving instruction from Samuel P. Black at his house in Murfreesboro, Tennessee; he was 19, she was 12. They would be formally introduced in the early 1820s with Polk&#x27;s involvement with the State Legislature. Shortly after he began courting her, legend says Andrew Jackson called her &quot;wealthy, pretty, ambitious, and intelligent,&quot; and urged Polk to marry her. In 1823 the two became engaged, and on January 1, 1824, Sarah Childress, aged 20, married James Polk, aged 28, at the plantation home of the bride&#x27;s parents near Murfreesboro.

They remained married for 25 years, but never had children. This is often attributed to the bladder stone surgery Polk had as a young man, which is thought to have made him sterile. They were the only presidential couple to never have children while together, biologically, adopted or from previous marriage. They raised a nephew, Marshall Tate Polk (1831–1884), as their ward for a few years before James sent him to a school in Washington, D.C., and later Georgetown University. After her husband&#x27;s death, Sarah would foster her great-niece, Sarah Polk Fall (1847–1924).

==Years of political life (1825–1849)==

During his political career, Polk assisted her husband with his speeches, using her insight to guide his outlines and provide needed assurance. She accompanied her husband as often as she could whenever he made trips to Washington and made sure to take an active political role. She even copied down his correspondence and developed notable social skills. Mrs. Polk was not a woman who chose to proclaim her sentiment openly, striving to maintain a humble demeanor. It was her husband himself who declared that his most active supporter and critique was his wife. She also gave him advice on policy matters and played an active role in his campaigns. Mrs. Polk maintained correspondence with national leaders gaining access to global issues that were relevant to her husband&#x27;s campaign. 

She was one of the first president&#x27;s wives to take an active role in her husband&#x27;s electoral process and campaign itself. Not only did she keep up with this measure of communication, but she also wrote for a local newspaper expressing her support for James Polk&#x27;s administration and his proposed policy initiatives. One of the more controversial topics she was able to write about was on the idea of expansionism which delved into the concept of manifest destiny pertaining to the United States&#x27; rights as a sovereign power. In Washington as a congressman&#x27;s wife during the administrations of John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, and Martin Van Buren, Polk very much enjoyed her social duties. Mrs. Polk was a religious woman who openly refused to dance, attend horse races, or theater. She took great pride in being a sociable woman but maintained a great sense of integrity. Though she did not drink herself, she made sure to serve a decadent selection of drinks and assorted foods during promotional dinners being the queen of hospitality. She was a woman who &quot;enjoyed wide popularity as well as deep respect&quot;. In 1830 she risked a breach with Jackson, her husband&#x27;s mentor, by taking part in the social ostracism of Peggy Eaton, during the Petticoat affair, although she continued to greet Eaton, unlike Vice President John C. Calhoun&#x27;s wife, Floride Calhoun, and most of the cabinet members&#x27; wives.

In 1845, Sarah Polk became the 11th First Lady of the United States. She was lively, charming, intelligent, and a good conversationalist. President Polk at times discussed policy matters with her. While she enjoyed politics, she also cautioned her husband, whose health was never robust, against overwork. A devout Presbyterian, as First Lady she banned dancing, card games, and hard liquor at official receptions. Unlike Julia Tyler&#x27;s waltzes, the Polk entertainments were sedate and sober affairs which earned the First Lady the nickname &quot;Sahara Sarah&quot;. Although some accounts stated that the Polks never served wine, a Congressman&#x27;s wife &quot;recorded in her diary details of a four-hour dinner for forty at the White House—glasses for six different wines, from pink champagne to ruby port and sauterne, &#x27;formed a rainbow around each plate.&#x27;&quot;

== Later life ==
After attending the inauguration of Zachary Taylor on March 4, 1849, Polk and her husband left by horse and carriage to their new home, Polk Place, in Nashville, Tennessee. Upon arriving in Tennessee, to Polk&#x27;s disappointment, Polk Place was not yet fully finished. They then went from Nashville to Columbia to spend two weeks with her mother-in-law before going to spend a few days in Murfreesboro with her family before returning to Nashville. Three months later, James Polk died of cholera, having had the shortest retirement of any U.S. president. He was 53 years old. 

Polk remained in Polk Place throughout these later years of her widowhood rarely leaving, becoming a bit of a recluse. She did not start hosting guests until a few years after her husband&#x27;s death. She hosted distinguished and popular guests throughout her widowhood, such as Abram Hewitt, Edward Cooper, John C. Calhoun II, John Catron, George Bancroft, among numerous others, including Presidents Rutherford B. Hayes and Grover Cleveland.

Once widowed, Polk unofficially adopted a grandniece, Sarah Polk Jetton, nicknamed &quot;Sallie&quot; (1847–1924), and saw her as her own daughter. After Polk&#x27;s niece died, she was brought to live with Polk. They lived together in Nashville until Polk&#x27;s death in 1891 at the age of 87.

Polk faced small financial difficulties throughout her widowhood. Her primary form of income was coming in through a plantation she inherited from her husband. She was forced to sell the plantation before the Civil War in 1861. Later she received money through her younger brother John Childress. Starting in 1884 the United States government granted Sarah a pension of $5,000 (~$ in ) a year until her death.
During the American Civil War, Polk was officially neutral, but she indicated sentiments in favor of preserving the Union during periodic visits to her home by several Union Army commanders, including Don Carlos Buell, George Henry Thomas, Ulysses S. Grant, and William Tecumseh Sherman. However, as a traditional Southern woman she also gave mention to Confederate sympathies during visits from Confederate generals in Nashville where Sarah would spend over 42 years of her widowhood. Sarah Polk lived at Polk Place for 42 years, the longest widowhood of any US first lady, and the longest retirement until Frances Cleveland exceeded her in 1939, and Rosalynn Carter (briefly) in 2023. As a true Victorian widow, Sarah always wore black in public. She visited her brother at his Childress-Ray House in Murfreesboro, whose daughter was married to Tennessee Governor John C. Brown. She also frequently visited her close friend Adelicia Acklen at Belmont.

== Death ==
Polk died on August 14, 1891, at age 87. She was originally buried next to her husband at their home in Nashville and was later reinterred with him at the Tennessee State Capitol when Polk Place was demolished in 1901. Polk left the contents of Polk Place to her grandniece, Sarah Polk Fall.

<text>Below is a chronological listing of the United States senators from Idaho. The state was admitted to the Union on July 3, 1890, and its U.S. senators belong to class 2 and class 3. Idaho&#x27;s current U.S. Senators are Republicans Mike Crapo (serving since 1999) and Jim Risch (serving since 2009). William Borah was Idaho&#x27;s longest-serving senator (1907–1940). Idaho is one of fourteen states alongside California, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Utah to have a younger senior senator and an older junior senator.

<doc id="416365" wikidata="Q1851271" url="?curid=416365" title="List of United States senators from Indiana">
<text>Indiana was admitted to the Union on December 11, 1816. Since then, the state has been represented in the United States Senate by 45 different men in class 1 and 3; David Turpie served non-consecutive terms in class 1, Dan Coats served non-consecutive terms in class 3, and William E. Jenner served in both classes. Until the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913, senators were elected by the Indiana General Assembly; after that, they were elected popularly by Indiana citizens. A senatorial term lasts six years, beginning on January 3. In case of a vacancy, the governor of Indiana has the duty to appoint a new U.S. senator. Indiana&#x27;s current U.S. senators are Republicans Todd Young (serving since 2017) and Jim Banks (serving since 2025). Richard Lugar was the state&#x27;s longest serving senator (1977–2013).

<text>Philip Stephen Hendrie is an American radio personality and actor. He is widely known for his voiceover talent throughout the radio and film industry. He came to prominence in the 1990s hosting &quot;The Phil Hendrie Show&quot;, a radio talk show where he portrayed both himself as a calm, rational host while simultaneously portraying any of several outrageous and offensive characters who would engage in debates with both Hendrie as well as actual listeners calling in to the show.

Hendrie has also acted professionally on a number of occasions, notably in a recurring role on the drama &quot;The Unit&quot;, as well as the voice of multiple characters on the animated comedies &quot;F is for Family&quot;, &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and&quot; The Midnight Gospel.&quot;

==Early life==
Hendrie was born and raised in Arcadia, California. In 1958, his family took a road trip to visit relatives in Toronto, Ontario. They listened to the radio the whole way. He knew then he wanted to work in radio one day. He was one of four children in an upper-middle-class Catholic family and was an altar boy at Arcadia&#x27;s Holy Angels Church. 
Hendrie&#x27;s father was a Sales Executive who came to Los Angeles in 1950 after serving in the Canadian Army during World War II. In his early teenage years, Hendrie has described listening to the radio as being his primary escape. He was a huge fan of the Top 40 D.J. &quot;Emperor&quot; Bob Hudson and once rode his bike to radio station KRLA in Pasadena to meet him.
When he was in his early teens, Hendrie&#x27;s parents divorced. His father moved to Europe and married a woman who had four kids. Hendrie&#x27;s family home was repossessed, forcing them to move into a small rented apartment where he slept on a couch during his senior year in high school. After graduating, Hendrie attended Pasadena City College to earn an English degree. After one year at college, he left for Orlando, Florida, in the early-1970s. He got a job in construction working on the build-out of Walt Disney World.

==Career==

===Radio===
Hendrie made a demo tape and got his first DJ job at WBJW in Winter Park, Florida a city just outside Orlando, in May of 1973. In 1978, he left WORJ in Orlando to do evenings at WNOE-FM in the French Quarter of New Orleans. He would go on from there to spin records up until 1988 in Miami.

In 1989, Phil debuted as a weekend talk show host on KFI, a news/talk station in Los Angeles.

After his show was cancelled on KFI, KVEN in Ventura, California, offered him a job in August 1990. In late September 1990, Hendrie introduced his first fictional on-air character on his radio talk show: Iraqi Raj Fahneen. The Gulf War had broken out and Fahneen vociferously defended Saddam Hussein. Thinking it was a real person on the air, listeners went ballistic. An entire cast of characters evolved, and in 18 months Hendrie took the show to major market stations in Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Miami and eventually back to Los Angeles.

As a radio satirist whose show is driven by a cast of fictional characters, all of whom Hendrie created and plays on air, he sets up a topic and discusses it with one of his characters. Feeding the circle of social satire are the callers who are real and genuinely passionate about what Hendrie&#x27;s &quot;guest&quot; is saying. Loyal fans enjoy being in on the ruse as Hendrie orchestrates a parody of his own profession—talk radio.

In October 1996 Hendrie went back to KFI to host &quot;The Phil Hendrie Show&quot; daily. Hendrie&#x27;s popularity resulted in the radio show going national in 1999 via Premiere Radio Networks, a subsidiary of Clear Channel Communications.

In February 2005, Hendrie&#x27;s flagship station, KFI, moved him to sister station KLAC in an effort to help turn the all-sports talk radio station into a ratings winner with entertainment programming incorporated. The show remained nationally syndicated on 120 radio stations until 2006.

On April 27, 2006, Hendrie announced he was leaving radio to pursue his acting career on a full-time basis. At the time, Hendrie was working on NBC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Teachers&quot; as cynical history teacher Dick Green.

His last day on air was June 23, 2006.

On June 4, 2007, it was announced that Phil Hendrie would return to radio June 25, 2007, via national syndicator Talk Radio Network (TRN), with shows airing nationally Monday through Friday from 10 PM to 1 AM Pacific Time on 100 radio stations. The show was a straight talk show until September 14, 2009, when he welcomed back his cast of characters, bringing back his original brand of radio theater. &quot;Radio needs alternative programming, like my show, now more than ever,&quot; said Hendrie. &quot;Having the advantage of communicating compelling and outrageous points of view through these characters is an opportunity no other host has.&quot;

On Saturday, November 20, 2010, KFI in Los Angeles announced that Phil Hendrie and his cast of voices were joining the station&#x27;s weekend lineup. Heard Saturdays on KFI, Hendrie did a local show for the station while doing his national show Monday through Friday.

On February 23, 2012, Hendrie announced to his fans via Twitter and the show&#x27;s website that February 25, 2012, would be his last KFI show. Hendrie said, &quot;This was not an easy decision because I&#x27;m going to miss everyone at KFI big time. However, doing a show like mine six days a week is murder.&quot;

In mid 2013, Hendrie announced he was leaving TRN. In 2014 Hendrie announced he would be leaving over-air broadcasting for good. He then switched to an all-digital format of his show that was listenable online, airing Monday-Friday at 9a.m. Pacific time, accessible from his website or via the smartphone application TuneIn. The show was then podcast for free within hours, available for a period of five days. Today, the show is available in podcast form on-demand seven days a week from Hendrie&#x27;s website, PodCast One and various other internet and podcast platforms.

<doc id="416367" wikidata="Q1469461" url="?curid=416367" title="List of United States senators from Illinois">
<text>Illinois was admitted to the Union on December 3, 1818, and has been represented in the United States Senate by 47 senators. Senators from Illinois are elected to class 2 and class 3.

The Senate twice refused to seat Frank L. Smith, in December 1926 for an appointed term and in March 1927 for an elected one, due to corruption, but he is included in this list because Smith and the Governor considered him to be a senator for approximately two years.

Of the eight African Americans ever to sit in the U.S. Senate since Reconstruction, three have held Illinois&#x27;s class 3 seat, including Barack Obama who went on to become the president of the United States. This makes Illinois the state with the most African-American senators. Illinois&#x27;s current U.S. senators are Democrats Dick Durbin (serving since 1997) and Tammy Duckworth (serving since 2017). Shelby Moore Cullom was the longest serving senator, who served from 1883 to 1913.

<doc id="416368" wikidata="Q499865" url="?curid=416368" title="List of United States senators from Kansas">
<text>This is a list of United States senators from Kansas. Kansas was admitted to the Union on January 29, 1861, and its senators belong to class 2 and class 3. Kansas&#x27;s current senators are Republicans Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall. 29 of Kansas&#x27;s senators have been Republicans, three have been Democrats, and two have been Populists. Arthur Capper was the state&#x27;s longest serving senator, served from 1919 to 1949.

Kansas last elected a Democratic senator in 1932, and both seats have been occupied by Republicans since 1939, the longest current streak of one party controlling both of a state&#x27;s Senate seats. Its class 2 seat has been occupied consecutively by Republicans since 1919, the longest current streak for a single seat in the country.

<text>Picea mariana, the black spruce, is a North American species of spruce tree in the pine family. It is widespread across Canada, found in all 10 provinces and all 3 territories. It is the official tree of Newfoundland and Labrador and is that province&#x27;s most abundant tree. Its range extends into northern parts of the United States: in Alaska, the Great Lakes region, and the upper Northeast. It is a frequent part of the biome known as taiga or boreal forest.

The Latin specific epithet &quot;mariana&quot; means &quot;of the Virgin Mary&quot;.

== Description ==

&quot;P. mariana&quot; is a slow-growing, small upright evergreen coniferous tree (rarely a shrub), having a straight trunk with little taper, a scruffy habit, and a narrow, pointed crown of short, compact, drooping branches with upturned tips. Through much of its range it averages tall with a trunk diameter at maturity, though occasional specimens can reach tall and diameter. The bark is thin, scaly, and greyish brown. The leaves are needle-like, long, stiff, four-sided, dark bluish green on the upper sides, paler glaucous green below. The cones are the smallest of all of the spruces, long and broad, spindle-shaped to nearly round, dark purple ripening red-brown, produced in dense clusters in the upper crown, opening at maturity but persisting for several years.

Natural hybridization occurs regularly with the closely related &quot;P. rubens&quot; (red spruce) and very rarely with &quot;P. glauca&quot; (white spruce). It differs from &quot;P. glauca&quot; in having a dense cover of small hairs on the bark of young branch tips, an often darker reddish-brown bark, shorter needles, smaller and rounder cones, and a preference for wetter lowland areas. Numerous differences in details of its needle and pollen morphology also exist but require careful microscopic examination to detect. From true firs, such as &quot;Abies balsamea&quot; (balsam fir), it differs in having pendulous cones, persistent woody leaf-bases, and four-angled needles, arranged all round the shoots.

Due to the large difference between heartwood and sapwood moisture content, it is easy to distinguish these two wood characteristics in ultrasound images, which are widely used as a nondestructive technique to assess the internal condition of the tree and avoid useless log breakdown. Older taxonomic synonyms include &quot;A. mariana&quot;, &quot;P. brevifolia&quot;, or &quot;P. nigra&quot;.

== Ecology ==
Growth varies with site quality. In swamp and muskeg it shows progressively slower growth rates from the edges toward the centre. The roots are shallow and wide spreading, resulting in susceptibility to windthrow. In the northern part of its range, ice pruned asymmetric black spruce are often seen with diminished foliage on the windward side. Tilted trees colloquially called &quot;drunken trees&quot; are associated with thawing of permafrost.

In the southern portion of its range it is found primarily on wet organic soils, but farther north its abundance on uplands increases. In the Great Lakes region it is most abundant in peat bogs and swamps, also on transitional sites between peatlands and uplands. In these areas it is rare on uplands, except in isolated areas of northern Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
Most stands are even-aged due to frequent fire intervals in black spruce forests. It commonly grows in pure stands on organic soils and in mixed stands on mineral soils. It is tolerant of nutrient-poor soils and is commonly found on poorly drained acidic peatlands. It is considered a climax species over most of its range; however, some ecologists question whether black spruce forests truly attain climax because fires usually occur at 50 to 150 year intervals, while &quot;stable&quot; conditions may not be attained for several hundred years. The frequent fire return interval, a natural fire ecology, perpetuates numerous successional communities. Throughout boreal North America, &quot;Betula papyrifera&quot; (paper birch) and &quot;Populus tremuloides&quot; (quaking aspen) are successional hardwoods that frequently invade burns in black spruce. Black spruce typically seeds in promptly after fire and with the continued absence of fire eventually dominates the hardwoods.

Black spruce is a pioneer that invades the sphagnum mat in filled-lake bogs, though often preceded slightly by &quot;Larix laricina&quot; (tamarack). Black spruce frequently out-competes shade-intolerant tamarack in the course of bog succession. However, as the peat soil is gradually elevated by the accumulation of organic matter and the fertility of the site improves, balsam fir and northern white cedar (&quot;Thuja occidentalis&quot;) eventually replace black spruce and tamarack. On drier sites following fires, black spruce can take over stands of faster growing jack pine (&quot;Pinus banksiana&quot;) by virtue of its ability to grow in partially shaded conditions which inhibit pine seedlings. But black spruce seedlings are intolerant to the low light and low moisture conditions under mature spruce stands. Balsam fir and northern white cedar, both more understory-tolerant species with deeper taproots, survive and eventually succeed the spruce in the absence of fire.

The spruce budworm, a moth larva, causes defoliation which kills trees if it occurs several years in a row, though black spruce is less susceptible than white spruce or balsam fir. Trees most at risk are those growing along with balsam fir and white spruce.

== Cultivation ==
Numerous cultivars have been selected for use in parks and gardens. The cultivar &quot;P. mariana&quot; &#x27;Nana&#x27; is a dwarf form which has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. Picea mariana is known to hybridize with Serbian spruce, &quot;Picea omorika&quot;. The hybrid is &quot;Picea machala&quot;, and hybrids with Sitka spruce are known as well.

== Uses and symbolism ==
Black spruce is the provincial tree of Newfoundland and Labrador. The timber is of low value due to the small size of the trees, but it is an important source of pulpwood and the primary source of it in Canada. Fast-food chopsticks are often made from black spruce. It is increasingly being used for making cross laminated timber by companies such as Nordic Structures, which allows the high strength due to the tight growth rings to be assembled into larger timbers. Along with red spruce, it has also been used to make spruce gum and spruce beer.

<doc id="416370" wikidata="Q238371" url="?curid=416370" title="Jane Pierce">
<text>Jane Means Pierce (née Appleton; March 12, 1806 – December 2, 1863) was the wife of Franklin Pierce and the first lady of the United States from 1853 to 1857. She married Franklin Pierce, then a congressman, in 1834 despite her family&#x27;s misgivings. She refused to live in Washington, D.C., and in 1842, she convinced her husband to retire from politics. He sought the Democratic presidential nomination without her knowledge in 1852 and was elected president later that year. Their only surviving son, Benjamin, was killed in a train accident before Franklin&#x27;s inauguration, sending Jane into a deep depression that afflicted her for the rest of her life. Pierce was a reclusive first lady, spending the first two years of her husband&#x27;s presidency mourning her son. Her duties at this time were often fulfilled by Abby Kent-Means. After Franklin&#x27;s presidency, they traveled abroad for two years before settling in Massachusetts. She died of tuberculosis in 1863.

Pierce disliked political life and was unhappy in the role of first lady. She took interest in abolitionism, and attempted to influence her husband&#x27;s decisions on the subject. A Puritan, Pierce was strictly religious and believed the tragedies she suffered were divine retribution for her and her husband&#x27;s sins. Jane has been described as the opposite of her husband, who was outgoing, political, and a heavy drinker. She was reclusive, averse to politics, and a teetotaler.

== Early life ==
Jane Appleton was born in Hampton, New Hampshire, on March 12, 1806, to Congregationalist minister Jesse Appleton and his wife Elizabeth Means Appleton. The Appletons had six children: three elder daughters, of which Jane was the third, and three younger sons. Their father became president of Bowdoin College in 1807, and the family settled in Brunswick, Maine (then part of Massachusetts). Her father&#x27;s religious practices included a strict fasting diet that caused his health to decline, leading to his death in 1819. After his death, the family lived with Elizabeth&#x27;s mother in Amherst, New Hampshire. In her childhood, Appleton acquired a devotion to Puritan, evangelical Calvinism.

Appleton came from a well-off and well-connected New England family. Jane&#x27;s education was of a high quality, consisting of both public schooling and homeschooling. She attended the prestigious Miss Catherine Fiske&#x27;s Young Ladies Seminary in Keene, New Hampshire, where she received an education of a higher quality than women could typically access. She was talented in music and enthusiastic about literature, but declined to pursue these further in favor of Bible study. As she approached young adulthood, Appleton was shy, devoutly religious, and pro-temperance. Even in her youth, her health was poor; she regularly contracted severe winter colds.

== Marriage and family ==
Appleton met Franklin Pierce after he moved to Amherst to study law at Bowdoin. One anecdote suggests that they met during a thunderstorm when he implored her not to sit under a tree for risk of lightning strikes. Another suggests that they were introduced by Alpheus Packard, Jane&#x27;s brother-in-law and one of Franklin&#x27;s professors. She may also have met him while he was visiting her mother&#x27;s home. Appleton&#x27;s family opposed the relationship for a number of reasons, including their difference in class, his poor manners, his drinking, his tolerance of slavery, his Episcopalian beliefs, and his political aspirations. They courted for seven years, including a period in which Franklin moved to Hillsborough, New Hampshire, to practice law and serve in the New Hampshire General Court. Franklin and Jane married in a small ceremony on November 19, 1834, by which time Franklin was a member of the House of Representatives. They were seen as opposites, Jane&#x27;s reclusiveness and depression contrasting with Franklin&#x27;s gregariousness and public aspirations.

The Pierces went together to Washington, D.C., after their marriage, but Jane found the city unpleasant. In 1835, she attended the White House New Year&#x27;s Day reception with her husband and met President Andrew Jackson. She decided to leave the city later that year, returning to her mother&#x27;s home in Amherst while her husband remained in Washington. The Pierces later purchased a home in Hillsborough where Jane chose to live while Franklin was away. They moved to Concord, New Hampshire, in 1838 while Franklin was a senator, and Jane encouraged him to resign and retire from politics in 1842. Jane abhorred politics, and her distaste for the subject created a tension that continued throughout her husband&#x27;s political ascent. Though politics was often a point of debate or argument between the two, they were otherwise warm with one another and wrote each other regularly when apart.

Franklin and Jane had three sons, all of whom died in childhood. Franklin Jr. was born in 1836 and died three days after his birth. Frank Robert was born in 1839 and died in 1843 at age four of epidemic typhus. Benjamin was born in 1841 and died in 1853 at age 11 in a train accident. Following the end of her husband&#x27;s term in the Senate, Pierce was able to live a domestic life with her family together at home. Franklin provided for the family with his law practice, though he briefly went away to serve as a brigadier general in the Mexican–American War. This period of Jane&#x27;s life is often regarded as her happiest, as her husband was out of politics and she still had two surviving sons. Their house was sold during the war, and the family made various living arrangements over the following months. President James K. Polk offered Franklin an appointment as United States Attorney General, but he turned it down due to Jane&#x27;s objection. After the death of their second son, Pierce focused on raising their only surviving son, Benjamin, in a strict religious manner while her husband operated his law practice. She wholly dedicated herself to Benjamin and avoided any obligations beyond her family and her religion. Pierce did not carry out housework due to her health, so it was carried out by a married couple that Franklin hired to care for Jane and Benjamin while he was away.

==First Lady of the United States==
In 1852, Pierce&#x27;s husband received the Democratic Party nomination for president. She is said to have fainted upon hearing the news. He had deceived her about his presidential aspirations, denying the extent to which he was seeking the office. He sought to persuade her that if he became president, their son Benjamin would be more likely to become successful. Despite this, she regularly prayed that her husband would lose the presidential election. Her prayers went unanswered, as he was elected by a large margin on November 2, 1852.

While Franklin was president-elect, a train with the Pierces on board derailed, and Benjamin was killed in front of his parents. Pierce went into a deeper depression after witnessing her final son&#x27;s death, believing that God took their sons as a punishment for her husband&#x27;s political aspirations. She did not attend his presidential inauguration, instead staying in Baltimore for two weeks. Pierce was also affected by the deaths of her predecessor Abigail Fillmore and Vice President William R. King over the following weeks.

For the first few months of her husband&#x27;s term, Pierce did not take visitors and only sparingly attended public receptions, and she entertained only family and friends. Upon arriving at the White House, she wore black and had the White House decorated for mourning. She did not host social events or supervise the White House in the traditional role of first lady, leaving these responsibilities to her aunt and close friend Abby Kent-Means. She avoided company, regularly engaging in private Bible study. Pierce also developed a friendship with Varina Davis, wife of Secretary of War Jefferson Davis. She took an interest in the Davises&#x27; infant son, though he became ill and died in 1854. She gradually acclimated to life as First Lady, attending the New Year&#x27;s reception two years into her husband&#x27;s term and the Friday evening receptions thereafter. Pierce attempted to communicate with her late son while she was first lady, sometimes writing letters to him as an exercise in grief. She also attempted to contact him through a séance with the assistance of the Fox sisters, major figures in the Spiritualism movement.

As first lady, Pierce insisted on adherence to religious practice in the White House, instructing the staff to attend church and holding religious services in the White House library. Pierce&#x27;s cousin Amos A. Lawrence described the effect this had on her husband, saying that he was deeply pious in her presence but drank heavily when she was away. She also lobbied him on occasion; in 1856, she convinced him to reverse the arrest of abolitionist Charles L. Robinson. During times of poor health, Franklin invited many of her nieces and nephews to the White House to care for her. Taking an interest in abolitionism, she began attending Congressional debates after her period of mourning to follow the issue. At the end of her husband&#x27;s term, she again declined to attend the presidential inauguration, this time of her husband&#x27;s successor James Buchanan.

==Later life and death==
The Pierces lived in Washington for a month after the end of Franklin&#x27;s presidential term and then toured New England during the summer. They traveled abroad for two years, returning home to purchase of land in Concord before leaving for the West Indies. Pierce avoided Concord as it reminded her of her late son, and she often stayed with relatives in Massachusetts for the remainder of her life. During the American Civil War, she supported the Union and the cause of abolitionism, while her husband supported the preservation of slavery in order to preserve the nation and the Constitution. Pierce&#x27;s bouts of tuberculosis worsened in the years after Franklin&#x27;s presidency, and she died on December 2, 1863, at age 57. She was buried at Old North Cemetery in Concord. Franklin Pierce died on October 8, 1869, aged 64, and was interred beside his wife and son. In her will, she bequeathed money to the American Bible Society, the American Society for Foreign Missions, and the American Colonization Society.

== Public perception and legacy ==

The general public&#x27;s first impression of Pierce was in a biography of her husband by family friend Nathaniel Hawthorne at the beginning of Franklin&#x27;s campaign. It emphasized her poor health as her husband&#x27;s reason for declining a role in the Polk administration, creating a reputation as a sickly woman that has persisted ever since. While first lady, Pierce was considered an invalid and seen as a depressing presence in a depressing White House, though she received sympathy from the people for her grief. She was known as &quot;the shadow of the White House&quot;. She received backlash from the public after canceling Saturday evening Marine Band concerts in view of the Sabbath. Hawthorne once wrote that she &quot;wasn&#x27;t really of this world.&quot;

Pierce is ranked poorly among historians, with polling showing that she is considered one of the least effectual first ladies. She is also one of the most obscure, having served in the role before it had national prominence and during a presidency that has itself become obscure. Much like other antebellum first ladies, she has often been identified as avoiding the spotlight and of little importance to her husband&#x27;s administration. She is considered to have had little influence on the position of first lady and set no precedent for her successors. Pierce&#x27;s influence on her husband manifested through her dislike of politics, including her role in his decision to retire from the Senate in 1842. Some scholars have suggested that in the course of her relationship with her husband, she may have felt a religious compulsion to save his soul and courted him because of his vices rather than despite them. While contemporary perception of Pierce was generally one of sympathy, a trend among 20th-century historians was to describe her as a hypochondriac who failed to support her husband during tragedy and to consider her as a damaging factor in her husband&#x27;s poorly received presidency.

== Political beliefs ==
Pierce was a Puritan, and this formed the basis of her worldview. Her religious beliefs impressed on her the conviction that suffering was punishment from God. She strongly opposed Washington&#x27;s political and social culture, lamenting the regular parties and alcohol consumption. She was raised as a Whig, which caused conflict with her family when she married her husband, who served in office as a Democrat. She supported the temperance movement and opposed the consumption of alcohol. Pierce also supported abolitionism, in contrast to her husband&#x27;s tolerance of slavery in the name of states&#x27; rights, and wished for a Union victory in the American Civil War. Pierce admired Andrew Jackson while he was president. She disliked Representative Davy Crockett, believing him &quot;conceited, stupid, [and] silly&quot;.

<text>Martin Andersen Nexø (26 June 1869 – 1 June 1954) was a Danish writer. He was one of the authors in the Modern Breakthrough movement in Danish art and literature. He was a socialist throughout his life and during the Second World War moved to the Soviet Union, and afterwards to Dresden in East Germany.

==Biography==

Martin Andersen Nexø was born into a large family (the fourth of eleven children) in Christianshavn, at the time an impoverished district of Copenhagen. In 1877 his family moved to Nexø on Bornholm, and he adopted the name of this town as his last name. Having been an industrial worker before, in Nexø he attended a folk high school, and later worked as a journalist. He spent the mid-1890s travelling in Southern Europe, and his book &quot;Soldage&quot; (1903) (English: &quot;Days in the Sun&quot;) is largely based on those travels. Like many of his literary contemporaries, including Johannes Vilhelm Jensen, Nexø was at first heavily influenced by fin-de-siècle pessimism, but gradually turned to a more extroverted view, joining the Social Democratic movement and later the Communist Party of Denmark; his later books reflect his political support of the Soviet Union.

&quot;Pelle Erobreren&quot; (English: &quot;Pelle the Conqueror&quot;), published in four volumes 1906–1910, is his best-known work and the one most translated. Its first section was made the subject of the DDR-FS movie &quot;Pelle der Eroberer&quot; in 1986 and the movie &quot;Pelle Erobreren&quot; in 1987. &quot;Ditte Menneskebarn&quot; (English: &quot;Ditte, Child of Man&quot;), written from 1917 to 1921, praises the working woman for her self-sacrifice; a Danish film version of the first part of the book was released in 1946 as &quot;Ditte, Child of Man&quot;. The much-debated &quot;Midt i en Jærntid&quot; (i.e. &quot;In an Iron Age&quot;, English: &quot;In God&#x27;s Land&quot;), written in 1929, satirises the Danish farmers of World War I. During his latter years, 1944 to 1956, Nexø wrote but did not complete a trilogy consisting of the books &quot;Morten hin Røde&quot; (English: &quot;Morten the Red&quot;), &quot;Den fortabte generation&quot; (English: &quot;The Lost Generation&quot;), and &quot;Jeanette&quot;. This was ostensibly a continuation of &quot;Pelle the Conqueror&quot;, but also a masked autobiography.

In 1941, during Denmark&#x27;s occupation by Germany, Danish police arrested Nexø due to his communist affiliation. Upon his release he traveled to neutral Sweden and then to the Soviet Union, where he made broadcasts to Nazi-occupied Denmark and Norway. After World War II, Nexø moved to Dresden in East Germany, where he was made an honorary citizen. The Martin-Andersen-Nexø-Gymnasium high school in Dresden was named after him. His international reputation as one of the greatest European social writers grew, especially, but not exclusively, in socialist countries.

Nexø died in Dresden in 1954 and was interred in the Assistens Kirkegård in the Nørrebro neighbourhood of Copenhagen. A minor planet, 3535 Ditte, discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1979, is named after the main character in his novel &quot;Ditte, Child of Man&quot;.
Martin Andersen Nexø&#x27;s home in Nexø has become a museum in his memory. As per Danish copyright law, his works entered the public domain on 1 January 2025, 70 full calendar years after his death in 1954.

==Honours and awards==
In 1949, Nexø received an honorary doctorate from the University of Greifswald&#x27;s Faculty of Arts.

<doc id="416378" wikidata="Q444550" url="?curid=416378" title="Harriet Lane">
<text>Harriet Rebecca Lane Johnston (May 9, 1830 – July 3, 1903) acted as first lady of the United States during the administration of her uncle, lifelong bachelor president James Buchanan, from 1857 to 1861. She has been described as the first of the modern first ladies, being a notably charming and diplomatic hostess, whose dress-styles were copied, and who promoted deserving causes. In her will, she left funds for a new school on the grounds of Washington National Cathedral. Several ships have been named in her honor, including the cutter USCGC &quot;Harriet Lane&quot;, still in service.

==Status==
Lane is the only person to have served as First Lady to a bachelor president, Buchanan being the only U.S. president never to have married. She is among 11 women who have served as First Lady, but were not married to the president, with most of the other women being relatives of widowed presidents.

==Early life==
Harriet Lane&#x27;s family was from Franklin County, Pennsylvania. She was the youngest child of Elliott Tole Lane, a merchant, and Jane Ann Buchanan Lane. She lost her mother when she was nine; when her father&#x27;s death two years later made her an orphan, she requested that her favorite uncle, James Buchanan, be appointed as her legal guardian. Buchanan, an unmarried Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, indulged his niece and her sister, enrolling them in boarding schools in Charles Town, Virginia (later for two years at the Georgetown Visitation Monastery in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C.). By this time, Buchanan was Secretary of State, and, as he had promised, he introduced her to fashionable and political circles.

In 1854, she joined him in London, where he was minister to the Court of St. James&#x27;s. Queen Victoria gave &quot;dear Miss Lane&quot; the rank of ambassador&#x27;s wife; admiring suitors gave her the fame of a beauty. In appearance &quot;Hal&quot; Lane was of medium height, with masses of light, almost golden-colored hair. She had eyes that were described as &quot;violet colored&quot;.

==Acting First Lady of the United States==
The capital welcomed its new &quot;Democratic Queen&quot; to the White House in 1857. Harriet was a popular hostess during the four years of the Buchanan presidency. Women copied her hair and clothing styles (especially when she lowered the neckline on her inaugural gown by 2.5 inches), parents named their daughters for her, and a popular song (&quot;Listen to the Mockingbird&quot;) was dedicated to her. While in the White House, she used her position to promote social causes, such as improving the living conditions of Native Americans in reservations. She also made a point of inviting artists and musicians to White House functions. For both her popularity and her advocacy work, she has been described as the first of the modern first ladies, and her popularity at the time is compared to that of Jacqueline Kennedy in the 1960s. The presidential yacht was named for her—the first of several ships to be named after her, one of which remains in service.

As sectional tensions increased, she worked out seating arrangements for her weekly formal dinner parties with special care, to give dignitaries their proper precedence and still keep political foes apart. Her tact did not falter, but her task became impossible—as did her uncle&#x27;s. Seven states had seceded by the time Buchanan retired from office and returned with his niece to his spacious country home, Wheatland, near Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

In the 1982 Siena College Research Institute survey asking historians to assess American first ladies, Lane and several other &quot;acting&quot; first ladies were included. The first ladies survey, which has been conducted periodically since, ranks first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. In the 1982 survey, out of 42 first ladies and acting first ladies, Lane was assessed as the 29th most highly regarded among historians. Acting first ladies such as Lane have been excluded from subsequent iterations of this survey.

==Romance and marriage==
During her time in England, Sir Fitzroy Kelly, then Prime Minister Palmerston&#x27;s attorney general, proposed marriage to her; Queen Victoria was strongly in favor of this match, as it would keep Lane in England.

Lane considered the advantages of a number of bachelors. Her uncle cautioned Lane against &quot;rushing precipitately into matrimonial connections&quot; as his ward found her potential suitors &quot;pleasant but dreadfully troublesome&quot;. Lane eventually married Baltimore banker Henry Elliott Johnston at the age of 36. They had two sons: James Buchanan Johnston (1866–1881) and Henry Elliot Johnston (1869–1882), but within the 18 years from 1867 to 1885, her uncle, her husband, and her children all died.

==Later life and death==
Harriet wrote her will in 1895 and lived another eight years, during which the country&#x27;s general prosperity greatly increased the value of her estate. She added a codicil in 1899 directing that a school building be constructed on the grounds of the Washington National Cathedral property and asked that it be called the Lane-Johnston Building &quot;to the end that the family names of my husband and myself may be associated with the bequest made in loving memory of our sons.&quot; A codicil of 1903 increased her gift by one third but said that only half the total was to be spent on the building. The remainder was &quot;specially to provide for the free maintenance, education and training of choirboys, primarily those in service of the Cathedral.&quot; This bequest founded the prestigious boys&#x27; school that today is called St. Albans School, which opened in October 1909. 
At Harriet Lane Johnston&#x27;s funeral, services were conducted by Bishop Satterlee and Canon DeVries of the Washington National Cathedral. She was buried in Green Mount Cemetery, Baltimore, Maryland, her grave marked with a Celtic cross like the Peace Cross on the cathedral close. In 1905, guests were invited to see the cornerstone of the first St. Albans School building, laid for what the invitation referred to as &quot;The Lane Johnston Choir School for Boys of the Washington Cathedral&quot;.

==Legacy==
Lane left bequests in her will that established a children&#x27;s hospital and a boys&#x27; school, and she donated her collection of artwork to the Smithsonian. Several Navy and Coast Guard ships have been named in her honor.

Her birthplace, the Lane House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

===Hospital and school===
She dedicated $400,000 () to establish the Harriet Lane Home for Invalid Children at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland as a memorial to two sons who had died in childhood. In October 1912 the Harriet Lane Home officially opened. It was the first children&#x27;s clinic in the United States that was associated with a medical school. Eventually treating over 60,000 children a year, the Harriet Lane Home became a pioneer treatment, teaching, and research clinic.

From 1930 to 1963 Helen Taussig, who helped to develop the blue baby operation, headed the pediatric cardiac clinic. Child psychiatrist Leo Kanner did studies of autistic children. Lawson Wilkins established an endocrine clinic that developed procedures used universally to treat children with certain glandular disorders, including dwarfism. John E. Bordley and William G. Hardy broke ground in detecting hearing impairments in very young children. It became a renowned pediatric facility; the Harriet Lane Outpatient Clinics serve thousands of children today, and the widely used manual for pediatric house officers, &quot;The Harriet Lane Handbook&quot;, bears her name.

The Harriet Lane Outpatient Clinics continue to operate in countries throughout the world.

The pediatric medicine &quot;Harriet Lane Handbook&quot; series continues in print and online, with multiple titles. The original title (subtitled &quot;A Manual for Pediatric House Officers&quot;) is in its 22nd edition, published by Mosby.

===Art collection===
She had an art collection based on European works which she left to the U.S. government. The Smithsonian Institution called her the &quot;First Lady of the National Collection of Fine Arts&quot; after her collection was accepted into public ownership.

===Namesake ships===
The United States Coast Guard has had three cutters named in her honor. The first was the USRC &quot;Harriet Lane&quot;, commissioned into the United States Revenue Cutter Service (predecessor of the USCG) in 1857. This cutter was transferred to the United States Navy in 1861 because of the American Civil War.

The second cutter named for Harriet Lane was the 125 foot USCGC &quot;Harriet Lane&quot; (WSC-141), commissioned in 1926 and decommissioned in 1946.

The third cutter named for Harriet Lane is the USCGC &quot;Harriet Lane&quot; (WMEC-903). The cutter was commissioned in May 1984, and , is still in active service.
