<text>Flexible electronics, also known as &quot;flex circuits&quot;, is a technology for assembling electronic circuits by mounting electronic components on flexible plastic substrates, such as polyimide, PEEK or transparent conductive polyester film. Additionally, flex circuits can be screen printed silver circuits on polyester. Flexible electronic assemblies may be manufactured using identical components used for rigid printed circuit boards, allowing the board to conform to a desired shape, or to flex during its use.

==Manufacturing==
Flexible printed circuits (FPCs) are made with a photolithographic technology. An alternative way of making flexible foil circuits or flexible flat cables (FFCs) is laminating very thin (0.07 mm) copper strips in between two layers of PET. These PET layers, typically 0.05 mm thick, are coated with an adhesive which is thermosetting, and will be activated during the lamination process. FPCs and FFCs have several advantages in many applications:
* Tightly assembled electronic packages, where electrical connections are required in 3 axes, such as cameras (static application).
* Electrical connections where the assembly is required to flex during its normal use, such as folding cell phones (dynamic application).
* Electrical connections between sub-assemblies to replace wire harnesses, which are heavier and bulkier, such as in cars, rockets and satellites.
* Electrical connections where board thickness or space constraints are driving factors.

===Advantage of FPCs===
* Potential to replace multiple rigid boards or connectors
* Single-sided circuits are ideal for dynamic or high-flex applications
* Stacked FPCs in various configurations

===Disadvantages of FPCs===
* Cost increase over rigid PCBs
* Increased risk of damage during handling or use
* More difficult assembly process
* Repair and rework is difficult or impossible
* Generally worse panel utilization resulting in increased cost

==Applications==
Flex circuits are often used as connectors in various applications where flexibility, space savings, or production constraints limit the serviceability of rigid circuit boards or hand wiring. 

Most flexible circuits are passive wiring structures that are used to interconnect electronic components such as integrated circuits, resistors, capacitors and the like; however, some are used only for making interconnections between other electronic assemblies either directly or by means of connectors. Consumer electronics devices make use of flexible circuits in cameras, personal entertainment devices, calculators, or exercise monitors.Flexible circuits are found in industrial and medical devices where many interconnections are required in a compact package. Cellular telephones are another widespread example of flexible circuits.

=== Input Devices ===
A common application of flex circuits is in Input devices like computer keyboards; most keyboards use flex circuits for the switch matrix. 

=== Displays===

==== LCD displays ====
In LCD fabrication, glass is used as a substrate. If thin flexible plastic or metal foil is used as the substrate instead, the entire system can be flexible, as the film deposited on top of the substrate is usually very thin, on the order of a few micrometres.

==== OLED displays ====
Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are normally used instead of a back-light for flexible displays, making a flexible organic light-emitting diode display.

=== Flexible batteries===
Flexible batteries are batteries, both primary and secondary, that are designed to be conformal and flexible, unlike traditional rigid ones.

=== Automotive circuits ===
In the automotive field, flexible circuits are used in instrument panels, under-hood controls, circuits to be concealed within the headliner of the cabin, and in ABS systems. 

=== Printers ===
In computer peripherals flexible circuits are used on the moving print head of printers, and to connect signals to the moving arm carrying the read/write heads of disk drives.

=== Solar cells ===

Flexible, thin-film solar cells have been developed for powering satellites. These cells are lightweight, can be rolled up for launch, and are easily deployable, making them a good match for the application. They can also be sewn into backpacks or outerwear, among many other types of consumer-oriented applications. 

The growing markets related with flexible and/or portable electronics, such as for self-powered IoT systems, have driven the development of bendable thin-film photovoltaics (PV) in view of enhancing the energetic autonomy of such off-grid devices. It has been shown that this class of PV technologies is already capable of reaching high solar-to-electricity efficiencies, at the level of rigid wafer-based solar cells, particularly when integrated with effective light-trapping structures. Such photonic schemes allow high broadband absorption in the thin PV absorber materials, despite their reduced thickness required for mechanical bendability.

=== Skin-like circuits ===
In December 2021, engineers from Keio University in Tokyo and Stanford University announced the creation of stretchable and skin-like semiconductor circuits. In the future, these wearable electronics may be used to send health data to doctors wirelessly.

=== Printed Electronics ===
Printed electronics are in use or under consideration include wireless sensors in packaging, skin patches that communicate with the internet, and buildings that detect leaks to enable preventative maintenance. Most of these applications are still in the prototyping and development stages. There is a particularly growing interest for flexible smart electronic systems, including photovoltaic, sensing and processing devices, driven by the desire to extend and integrate the latest advances in (opto-)electronic technologies into a broad range of low-cost (even disposable) consumer products of our everyday life, and as tools to bring together the digital and physical worlds.

Norwegian company ThinFilm demonstrated roll-to-roll printed organic memory in 2009.

Another company, Rotimpres based in Spain, has successfully introduced applications on different markets as for instance; heaters for smart furniture or to prevent mist and capacitive switch for keyboards on white goods and industrial machines.

==History==
Patents issued at the turn of the 20th century show interest in flat electrical conductors sandwiched between layers of insulating material. The resulting electrical circuits were to serve in early telephony switching applications. One of the earliest descriptions of what could be called a flex circuit was unearthed by Dr Ken Gilleo and disclosed in a 1903 English patent by Albert Hansen that described a construction consisting of flat metal conductors on paraffin coated paper. Thomas Edison’s lab books from the period indicate that he was thinking to coat cellulose gum applied to linen paper with graphite powder to create what would have clearly been flexible circuits, though no evidence indicates that it was reduced to practice.

The 1947 publication &quot;Printed Circuit Techniques&quot; by Brunetti and Curtis a brief discussion of creating circuits on what would have been flexible insulating materials (e.g. paper). In the 1950s Dahlgren and Sanders made significant strides developing and patenting processes for printing and etching flat conductors on flexible base materials to replace wire harnesses. An advertisement from the 1950s placed by Photocircuits Corporation demonstrated their interest in flexible circuits.

Flexible circuits are variously known around the world variously as &quot;flexible printed wiring, flex print, flexi circuits,&quot; are used in many products. Credit is due to the efforts of Japanese electronics packaging engineers who have found ways to employ flexible circuit technology. Flexible circuits are one of the fastest growing interconnection product market segments. One variation on flexible circuit technology is called &quot;flexible electronics&quot;. It involves the integration of both active and passive functions in the device.

==Flexible circuit structures==
Flexible circuits display significant variation in their construction. 

===Single-sided flex circuits===
Single-sided flexible circuits have a conductor layer made of either a metal or conductive (metal filled) polymer on a flexible dielectric film. Component termination features are accessible only from one side. Holes may be formed in the base film to allow component leads to pass through for interconnection, normally by soldering. Single sided flex circuits can be fabricated with or without such protective coatings as cover layers or cover coats, however the use of a protective coating over circuits is the most common practice. The development of surface mounted devices on sputtered conductive films has enabled the production of transparent LED Films, which is used in LED Glass but also in flexible automotive lighting composites.

===Double access or back-bared flex circuits===
Double access flex, also known as back-bared flex, are flexible circuits that have a single conductor layer, but allow access to selected features of the conductor pattern from both sides. While this type of circuit has benefits, the specialized processing requirements for accessing the features limits its use.

===Sculptured flex circuits===
Manufacturing sculptured flex circuits involves a special flex circuit multi-step etching method that yields a flexible circuit having finished copper conductors wherein the conductor thickness differs at various places along their length. (I.e., the conductors are thin in flexible areas and thick at interconnection points.)

===Double-sided flex circuits===
Double-sided flex circuits have two conductor layers. They can be fabricated with or without plated through holes, though the plated through hole variation is much more common. When constructed without plated through holes, connection features are accessed from one side only, and the circuit is defined as a &quot;Type V (5)&quot; according to military specifications. Because of the plated through hole, terminations are provided on both sides of the circuit, thus allowing components to be placed on either side. Depending on design requirements, double-sided flex circuits can be fabricated with protective coverlayers on one, both or neither side of the completed circuit, but are most commonly produced with the protective layer on both sides. One major advantage is that it allows easy crossover connections. Many single sided circuits are built on a double sided substrate because of the crossover connections. An example of this use is the circuit that connects a mousepad to the motherboard. All connections on that circuit are located on only one side of the substrate, except a small crossover connection that uses the other side.

===Multilayer flex circuits===
Flex circuits with three or more layers of conductors are known as multilayer flex circuits. Commonly the layers are interconnected by means of plated through holes, though this is not required because it is possible to provide openings to access lower circuit level features. The layers may or may not be continuously laminated together throughout the construction with the exception of the areas occupied by through-holes. Discontinuous lamination is common in cases requiring maximum flexibility. This is accomplished by leaving unbonded the areas where flexing or bending is to occur.

===Rigid-flex circuits===
Rigid-flex circuits are a hybrid combining rigid and flexible substrates laminated into a single structure. Rigid-flex circuits are not rigidized flex constructions, which are flex circuits to which a stiffener is attached to support the weight of the components. A rigidized or stiffened flex circuit can have one or more conductor layers. The terms represent quite different products.

The layers are normally interconnected by plated through holes. Rigid-flex circuits are often chosen by military product designers and increasingly in commercial products. Compaq Computer chose the approach for laptop computer boards in the 1990s. While the computer&#x27;s main rigid-flex PCBA did not flex during use, subsequent Compaq designs utilized rigid-flex circuits for the hinged display cable, passing tens of thousands of flexures during testing. By 2013, the use of rigid-flex circuits in consumer laptop computers had become common.

Rigid-flex boards are normally multilayer structures; however, two metal layer constructions are sometimes used.

===Polymer thick film flex circuits===
Polymer thick film (PTF) flex circuits print circuit elements onto a polymer film. They are typically single conductor layer structures, however two or more metal layers can be printed sequentially separated by printed insulating layers. While lower in conductivity and thus limited to certain applications, PTF circuits have found a home in low-power applications at slightly higher voltages. Keyboards are a common application.

==Flexible circuit materials==
Each element of the flex circuit construction must be able to consistently meet the demands placed upon it for the life of the product. In addition, the material must work reliably in concert with the other elements of the flexible circuit construction to assure ease of manufacture and reliability. Following are brief descriptions of the basic elements of flex circuit construction and their functions.

===Base material===
The base material is the flexible polymer film which provides the foundation for the laminate. Under normal circumstances, the flex circuit base material provides most primary physical and electrical properties of the flexible circuit. In the case of adhesiveless circuit constructions, the base material provides all of the characteristic properties.
While a wide range of thickness is possible, most flexible films are provided in a narrow range of relatively thin dimension from 12 μm to 125 μm (1/2 mil to 5 mils) but thinner and thicker material are possible. Thinner materials are of course more flexible and for most material, stiffness increase is proportional to the cube of thickness. Thus for example, means that if the thickness is doubled, the material becomes eight times stiffer and will only deflect 1/8 as much under the same load.
There are a number of different materials used as base films including: polyester (PET), polyimide (PI), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyetherimide (PEI), along with various fluropolymers (FEP) and copolymers. Polyimide films are most prevalent owing to their blend of advantageous electrical, mechanical, chemical and thermal properties.

===Bonding adhesive===
Adhesives are used as the bonding medium for creating a laminate. When it comes to temperature resistance, the adhesive is typically the performance limiting element of a laminate especially when polyimide is the base material. Because of the earlier difficulties associated with polyimide adhesives, many polyimide flex circuits presently employ adhesive systems of different polymer families. However some newer thermoplastic polyimide adhesives are making important in-roads.
As with the base films, adhesives come in different thickness. Thickness selection is typically a function of the application. For example, different adhesive thickness is commonly used in the creation of cover layers in order to meet the fill demands of different copper foil thickness which may be encountered.

===Metal foil===
A metal foil is most commonly used as the conductive element of a flexible laminate. The metal foil is the material from which the circuit paths are normally etched. A wide variety of metal foils of varying thickness are available from which to choose and create a flex circuit, however copper foils serve the vast majority of all flexible circuit applications. Copper&#x27;s excellent balance of cost and physical and electrical performance attributes make it an excellent choice. There are actually many different types of copper foil. The IPC identifies eight different types of copper foil for printed circuits divided into two much broader categories, electrodeposited and wrought, each having four sub-types.) As a result, there are a number of different types of copper foil available for flex circuit applications to serve the varied purposes of different end products. With most copper foil, a thin surface treatment is commonly applied to one side of the foil to improve its adhesion to the base film. Copper foils are of two basic types: wrought (rolled) and electrodeposited and their properties are quite different. Rolled and annealed foils are the most common choice, however thinner films which are electroplated are becoming increasingly popular.

In certain non standard cases, the circuit manufacturer may be called upon to create a specialty laminate by using a specified alternative metal foil, such as a special copper alloy or other metal foil in the construction. This is accomplished by laminating the foil to a base film with or without an adhesive depending on the nature and properties of the base film.

==Flexible circuit industry standards and specifications==
Specifications are developed to provide a common ground of understanding of what a product should look like and how it should perform. Standards are developed directly by manufacturer&#x27;s associations such as the Association Connecting Electronics Industries (IPC) and by users of flexible circuits.

<doc id="251877" wikidata="Q1615188" url="?curid=251877" title="King of Hearts (1966 film)">
<text>King of Hearts (original French title: Le Roi de cœur) is a 1966 French/Italian international co-production comedy-drama film directed by Philippe de Broca and starring Alan Bates and Geneviève Bujold.

The film is set in a small town in France near the end of World War I. As the Imperial German Army retreats, they booby trap the whole town to explode. The locals flee and, left to their own devices, a gaggle of cheerful lunatics escape the asylum and take over the town — thoroughly confusing the lone Scottish soldier who has been dispatched to defuse the bomb.

==Plot==
In October 1918, as the Great War is ending, a small village in France is awaiting liberation from German occupiers. The retreating Germans wire the automaton clock in the main square to set off a bomb when the mechanical knight strikes the bell at midnight, blowing up the ammunition magazine and the entire town. The town’s barber, an Allied agent, overhears and passes the word of the impending explosion. The residents quickly abandon the town, leaving behind homes, businesses, and the insane asylum. The barber is killed while transmitting to the Allies, only managing to relay that the magazine will blow up when “the knight strikes at midnight.”

Signaller Charles Plumpick, whose expertise is caring for war pigeons, not explosives, is sent by his colonel to disarm the bomb. He needs to discover the meaning of the phrase “the knight strikes at midnight.”

Arriving in town with two pigeons in a cage, Plumpick must evade German soldiers. Slipping into the asylum, he puts on pajamas and mixes with inmates who introduce themselves as The Duke of Clubs and Monsignor Daisy. When Plumpick introduces himself as “the King of Hearts,” the inmates accept him with deference and the Germans overlook him. Back in town, Plumpick is knocked unconscious by a falling pole, unaware when the inmates leave the asylum, occupy the town, and take on the roles of the townspeople, including those of bishop, brothel madame, prostitutes, barber, circus manager, circus performers, firefighters, soldiers, duke, and duchess. Regaining consciousness, Plumpick has no reason to think the people left in town are not who they appear to be—other than the colorful and playful way in which they&#x27;re living their lives, so at odds with the fearful and war-ravaged times. 

The barber, his supposed contact, does not recognize the password phrase “the mackerel likes frying&quot; and is unhelpful to Plumpick’s mission. “General Geranium” cannot direct him to the magazine. One of his pigeons is shot down by the Germans, who mistakenly interpret its message to mean the magazine has been dismantled. Finding the asylum empty, he finally realizes who is occupying the town. The lunatics crown Plumpick the &quot;King of Hearts&quot; with surreal pageantry as he frantically tries to find the bomb. The madame introduces him to the young innocent Poppy, a neophyte eager to help forget the war around them. Plumpick warns of the impending explosion at midnight, but everyone shrugs it off, living for the day. As &quot;king,&quot; he decides to lead them all out of the town to safety. The inmates follow him to the edge of town but refuse to go further into the dangerous unknown world. As midnight approaches, he almost gives up.

At three minutes to midnight Plumpick is watching the clocktower with Poppy, anticipating the end. Poppy comments that the knight will come out at midnight. Suddenly Plumpick understands and climbs the clocktower to stop the mechanical knight from striking the bell. As he struggles to dislodge the bell, the knight approaches, strikes Plumpkin’s head instead of the bell, and then retreats. The town is saved.

As morning breaks, the Germans march toward town as the British colonel orders his men to line up—including Plumpick. Plumpick joins the formation, but Poppy and the women pull him out of the formation as it marches away. Despite his protests, they take their &quot;king,&quot; bound and gagged, to a balcony overlooking the square to watch as the British and German troops confront and shoot each other dead. Plumpick is the only soldier left alive.

A lookout announces that thousands of “liberators” are converging from all sides. Not wanting to meet the “outsiders,” the inmates decide to leave and return to the insane asylum. 

Plumpick and his surviving pigeon receive medals for their mission. While being transported with the troops past the asylum, Plumpick jumps off the truck, discards his rifle and uniform, and presents himself at the gate of the asylum, stark naked holding only the cage with his favorite pigeon. The inmates joyously welcome their “King of Hearts,” and they all agree that he will never again leave them.

The film posits the question, &quot;Who is crazier, the asylum inmates or the battlefield soldiers&quot;?

==Cast==
==Release==
When it was released in France in 1966, &quot;King of Hearts&quot; was not especially successful critically or at the box office, with only 141,035 admissions.

However, it achieved cult film status, when United States distribution rights were picked up by Randy Finley and Specialty Films in Seattle in 1973. It was paired with Marv Newland&#x27;s &quot;Bambi Meets Godzilla&quot; and John Magnuson&#x27;s &quot;Thank You Mask Man&quot; and marketed under the heading &quot;The King of Hearts and His Loyal Short Subjects&quot;. During the mid 1970s, it was presented in repertory movie theaters as well as non-theatrical college and university film series across the United States, eventually running for five years at the now defunct film house the Central Square Cinemas (2 screens) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Stage adaptation==

In 1978, &quot;King of Hearts&quot; was adapted as a Broadway musical of the same name, with a book by Joseph Stein, lyrics by Jacob Brackman, music by Peter Link, orchestrations by Bill Brohn, set design by Santo Loquasto, and direction and choreography by Ron Field. The cast featured Don Scardino as the lead character, who was reworked as an American soldier named Johnny Perkins. Pamela Blair, Bob Gunton, and Millicent Martin played supporting roles. Opening at New York City&#x27;s Minskoff Theatre on October 22, amid the three-month 1978 New York City newspaper strike that may have impeded its advance publicity, the show closed after 48 performances.

<doc id="251879" wikidata="Q319084" url="?curid=251879" title="Al Franken">
<text>Alan Stuart Franken (born May 21, 1951) is an American politician, comedian, actor, and writer who served as a United States senator from Minnesota from 2009 to 2018. He first gained fame as a writer and performer on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where he worked for three stints. He first served as a writer for the show from 1975 to 1980, and returned from 1985 to 1995 as a writer and, briefly, a cast member. After decades as an entertainer, he became a liberal political activist, hosting &quot;The Al Franken Show&quot; on Air America Radio.

Franken was elected to the United States Senate in 2008 as the nominee of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL, an affiliate of the Democratic Party), defeating incumbent Republican Senator Norm Coleman by 312 votes out of nearly three million cast (a margin of just over 0.01%) in one of the closest elections in the history of the Senate. Though initially dismissed as a novelty candidate due to his comedic background, Franken demonstrated political acumen and was reelected in 2014 with 53.2% of the vote over Republican challenger Mike McFadden. Franken resigned on January 2, 2018, after allegations of sexual misconduct were made against him. He has since said he regrets that decision.

In September 2019, Franken announced he would be hosting &quot;The Al Franken Show&quot; on Saturday mornings on SiriusXM radio. It covers global affairs, politics, and entertainment.

== Early life and education ==
Franken was born in New York City to Joseph Philip Franken (1908–1993), a printing salesman, and Phoebe Geraldine Franken (née Kunst) (1918–2003), a real estate agent. His paternal grandparents emigrated from Germany; his maternal grandfather came from Grodno, Russian Empire; and his maternal grandmother&#x27;s parents were also from the Russian Empire. Phoebe was from Allentown, Pennsylvania. Both of his parents were Jews, and Franken was raised in a Reform Jewish home and attended Temple Israel in Minneapolis. He has an older brother, Owen (b. circa 1946), who is a photojournalist, and his cousin Bob is a journalist for MSNBC.

The Frankens moved to Albert Lea, Minnesota, when Al was four years old. His father opened a quilting factory, but it failed after two years. The family then moved to St. Louis Park, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. Franken graduated from The Blake School in 1969, where he was a member of the wrestling team. Franken says that he scored 800 (out of 800) on the math section of his SATs and 662 on the verbal section. He attended Harvard College, where he majored in political science, graduating &quot;cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Arts in 1973. As a student, Franken wrote comedy and idolized comedians Dick Gregory and Lenny Bruce because they did acts about hypocrisy and corruption while making the audience laugh.

Franken began performing in high school, where he and his longtime friend and writing partner Tom Davis were known for their comedy. The duo first performed on stage at Minneapolis&#x27;s Brave New Workshop theater specializing in political satire. They soon found themselves in what was described as &quot;a life of near-total failure on the fringes of show business in Los Angeles&quot;.

== &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; ==
Franken and Tom Davis were recruited as two of the original writers and occasional performers on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) (1975–1980, 1985–1995). In &quot;SNL&quot;″s first season, the two apprentice writers shared a salary of $350 per week. Franken received 15 Emmy nominations and five Emmy awards for his television writing and producing, while creating such characters as self-help guru Stuart Smalley. Another routine proclaimed the 1980s the &quot;Al Franken Decade&quot;. Franken and Davis wrote the script of the 1986 comedy film &quot;One More Saturday Night&quot;, appearing in it as rock singers in a band called Bad Mouth. They also had minor roles in &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; and the film &quot;Trading Places&quot;, starring Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd. In the early 80s, Franken, Davis, and Jim Downey wrote a feature film parody of &quot;1984&quot; called &quot;1985&quot; for Lorne Michaels to produce under his deal with MGM, but the movie was deemed too expensive and never produced.

On &quot;Weekend Update&quot; near the end of season 5, Franken delivered a commentary called &quot;A Limo for a Lame-O&quot;. He mocked controversial NBC president Fred Silverman as &quot;a total unequivocal failure&quot; and displayed a chart showing the poor ratings of NBC programs. As a result of this sketch, Silverman declined Lorne Michaels&#x27;s recommendation for Franken to succeed him as the producer, and Franken left the show when Michaels did, at the end of the 1979–1980 season. Franken returned to the show in 1985 as a writer and occasional performer. He has acknowledged using cocaine and other illegal drugs while working in television and stated that he stopped after John Belushi died of an overdose. In 1995, Franken left the show in protest over losing the role of &quot;Weekend Update&quot; anchor to Norm Macdonald.

== Post-&quot;SNL&quot; activities ==

In 1995, Franken wrote and starred in the film &quot;Stuart Saves His Family&quot;, which was based on his &quot;SNL&quot; character Stuart Smalley. The film was a critical and commercial failure and Franken became depressed as a result. Despite its aggregate rating of 30% on Rotten Tomatoes, the film received favorable reviews from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and Gene Siskel.

Franken is the author of four books that made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. His 1996 book &quot;Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations&quot; topped the &quot;New York Times&quot; list; the audiobook, which was read by Franken, won a Grammy Award. Another Grammy was awarded for Franken&#x27;s 2003 &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right&quot;, a satirical book on American politics and conservatism. The book&#x27;s title incorporated the Fox News slogan &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot;, and had a cover photo of Fox News commentator Bill O&#x27;Reilly; that August, Fox News sued claiming infringement of its registered trademark phrase. A federal judge found the lawsuit &quot;wholly without merit&quot;. The incident focused media attention on Franken&#x27;s book and, according to him, greatly increased its sales. The publicity resulting from the lawsuit propelled Franken&#x27;s yet-to-be-released book to number 1 on Amazon.com.

Franken signed a one-year contract in early 2004 to host a talk show for Air America Radio&#x27;s flagship program with co-host Katherine Lanpher, who remained with the show until October 2005. The network was launched on March 31, 2004. Originally named &quot;The O&#x27;Franken Factor&quot; as a pun on right-wing talk show &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, but later renamed &quot;The Al Franken Show&quot; on July 12, 2004, the show aired three hours a day, five days a week for three years. Its stated goal was to put more progressive views on the public airwaves to counter what Franken perceived as the dominance of conservative syndicated commentary on the radio: &quot;I&#x27;m doing this because I want to use my energies to get Bush unelected&quot;, he told a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter in 2004. Franken&#x27;s last radio show on Air America Radio was on February 14, 2007, at the end of which he announced his candidacy for the United States Senate.

Franken also co-wrote the film &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;, co-created and starred in the NBC sitcom &quot;LateLine&quot;, and appeared in the 2004 remake of &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;.

In 2003, Franken served as a Fellow at Harvard Kennedy School&#x27;s Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy. Since 2005 he has been a contributor to &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;.

Franken toured Iraq several times with the United Service Organizations (USO). On March 25, 2009, he was presented with the USO Metro Merit Award for his ten years of involvement with the organization.

== Political activism ==

According to an article by Richard Corliss published in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;In a way, Franken has been running for office since the late &#x27;70s.&quot; Corliss also hinted at Franken&#x27;s &quot;possibly ironic role as a relentless self-promoter&quot; in proclaiming the 1980s &quot;The Al Franken Decade&quot; and saying, &quot;Vote for me, Al Franken. You&#x27;ll be glad you did!&quot; In 1999 Franken released a parody book, &quot;Why Not Me?&quot;, detailing his hypothetical campaign for president in 2000. He had been a strong supporter of Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone and was deeply affected by Wellstone&#x27;s death in a plane crash shortly before the 2002 election. Wellstone was a mentor and political and personal role model for Franken, who stated his hopes of following in Wellstone&#x27;s footsteps. Senator Norm Coleman&#x27;s comment that he was a &quot;99 percent improvement&quot; over Wellstone was an impetus for Franken&#x27;s run for the Senate.

Franken said he learned that 21% of Americans received most of their news from talk radio, an almost exclusively conservative medium. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to sit on the sidelines, and I believed Air America could make a difference&quot;, he said. In November 2003 Franken talked about moving back to his home state of Minnesota to run for the Senate. At the time the seat once held by Wellstone was occupied by Republican Norm Coleman. At a 2004 Democratic presidential campaign event, Franken tackled a man who was allegedly threatening other attendees and heckling Governor Howard Dean. In 2005 Franken announced his move to Minnesota: &quot;I can tell you honestly, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m going to run, but I&#x27;m doing the stuff I need to do in order to do it.&quot; In late 2005 he started his own political action committee, Midwest Values PAC. By early 2007 the PAC had raised more than $1million.

Franken was the subject of the 2006 documentary film &quot;Al Franken: God Spoke&quot;, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;an investigation of the phenomenon of ideological celebrity&quot;.
Franken initially supported the Iraq War, but opposed the 2007 troop surge. In an interview with MSNBC&#x27;s Joe Scarborough, he said that he &quot;believed Colin Powell&quot;, whose presentation at the United Nations convinced him that the war was necessary, but had since come to believe that &quot;we were misled into the war&quot; and urged the Democratic-controlled Congress to refuse to pass appropriations bills to fund the war if they did not include timetables for leaving Iraq. In an interview with Josh Marshall, Franken said of the Democrats, &quot;I think we&#x27;ve gotta make President George W. Bush say, &#x27;OK, I&#x27;m cutting off funding because I won&#x27;t agree to a timetable.

In 2004, Franken favored transitioning to a universal health care system, with the provision that every child in America would receive health care coverage immediately. In 2014, he objected to efforts to privatize Social Security or cut benefits, favoring raising the cap on wages to which Social Security taxes apply. On his 2008 campaign website, he voiced support for cutting subsidies for oil companies, increasing money available for college students, and cutting interest rates on student loans.

During the 2008 election, New York state officials asserted that Al Franken Inc. had failed to carry required workers&#x27; compensation insurance for employees who assisted him with his comedy and public speaking from 2002 to 2005. Franken paid a $25,000 fine to the state of New York upon being advised his corporation was out of compliance with the state&#x27;s workers&#x27; compensation laws. At the same time, the California Franchise Tax Board reported that the same corporation owed more than $4,743 in taxes, fines, and associated penalties in the state of California for 2003 through 2007, because the corporation did not file tax returns in the state for those years. A Franken representative said that it followed the advice of an accountant who believed when the corporation stopped doing business in California that no further filing was required. Franken subsequently paid $70,000 in back income taxes in 17 states dating back to 2003, mostly from his speeches and other paid appearances. Franken said he paid the income tax in his state of residence, and he would seek retroactive credit for paying the taxes in the wrong state.

== U.S. Senate ==

===2008 elections===
On January 29, 2007, Franken announced his departure from Air America Radio, and on the day of his final show, February 14, he formally announced his candidacy for the United States Senate from Minnesota in 2008. Challenging him for the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party endorsement was Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer, a professor, author, and activist; trial lawyer Mike Ciresi; and attorney and human rights activist Jim Cohen, who dropped out of the race early. Franken won the nomination with 65% of the vote.

On July 8, 2007, Franken&#x27;s campaign stated that it expected to announce that he had raised more money than his Republican opponent, Norm Coleman, during the second quarter of the year, taking in $1.9million to Coleman&#x27;s $1.6million, although in early July 2007, Coleman&#x27;s $3.8million cash on hand exceeded Franken&#x27;s $2million.

In May 2008, the Minnesota Republican Party released a letter about an article Franken had written for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in 2000 titled &quot;Porn-O-Rama!&quot; The letter, signed by six prominent GOP women, including a state senator and state representative, called on Franken to apologize for what they called a &quot;demeaning and degrading&quot; article. His campaign spokesman responded, &quot;Al had a long career as a satirist. But he understands the difference between what you say as a satirist and what you do as a senator. And as a Senator, Norm Coleman has disrespected the people of Minnesota by putting the Exxons and Halliburtons ahead of working families. And there&#x27;s nothing funny about that.&quot;

On June 7, 2008, Franken was endorsed by the DFL. In a July 2008 interview with CNN, he was endorsed by Ben Stein, an entertainer, speechwriter, lawyer and author known for his conservative views, who generally supported Republican candidates. Stein said of Franken, &quot;He is my pal, and he is a really, really capable smart guy. I don&#x27;t agree with all of his positions, but he is a very impressive guy, and I think he should be in the Senate.&quot;

During his campaign, Franken was criticized for advising &quot;SNL&quot; creator Lorne Michaels on a political sketch ridiculing Senator John McCain&#x27;s ads attacking Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. Coleman&#x27;s campaign reacted, saying, &quot;Once again, he proves he&#x27;s more interested in entertainment than service, and ridiculing those with whom he disagrees.&quot;

Preliminary reports on election night, November 4, were that Coleman was leading by over 700 votes, but the official results, certified on November 18, 2008, had Coleman leading by only 215 votes. As the two candidates were separated by less than 0.5 percent of the votes cast, the Minnesota Secretary of State, Mark Ritchie authorized the automatic recount provided for in Minnesota election law. In the recount, ballots and certifying materials were examined by hand, and candidates could file challenges to the legality of ballots or materials for inclusion or exclusion. On January 5, 2009, the Minnesota State Canvassing Board certified the recounted vote totals, with Franken ahead by 225 votes.
On January 6, 2009, Coleman&#x27;s campaign filed an election contest which led to a trial before a three-judge panel. The trial ended on April 7, when the panel ruled that 351 of 387 disputed absentee ballots were incorrectly rejected and ordered them counted. Counting those ballots raised Franken&#x27;s lead to 312 votes. Coleman appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court on April 20. On April 24 the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Oral arguments were conducted on June 1.

On June 30, 2009, the Minnesota Supreme Court unanimously rejected Coleman&#x27;s appeal and said that Franken was entitled to be certified as the winner. Shortly after the court&#x27;s decision, Coleman conceded. Governor Tim Pawlenty signed Franken&#x27;s election certificate that evening.

===2014 elections===
Franken was reelected to a second term in 2014. He won the August 12 primary election, in which he was challenged by Sandra Henningsgard, with 94.5% of the vote. He won the general election against the Republican nominee, Mike McFadden with 53.2% of the vote.

=== Tenure ===

Franken was sworn into the Senate on July 7, 2009, 246 days after the election. He took the oath of office with the Bible of late Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone, whose old seat Senate leaders set aside for Franken.

On August 6, 2009, Franken presided over the confirmation vote of Sonia Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. On August 5, 2010, Franken presided over the confirmation vote of Elena Kagan. His first piece of legislation, the Service Dogs for Veterans Act, which he wrote jointly with Republican Senator Johnny Isakson, passed the Senate by unanimous consent. It established a program with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to pair disabled veterans with service dogs.
A video of Franken at the Minnesota State Fair on September 2, 2009, engaging in a discussion with a group of Tea Party protesters on health care reform, began circulating on the Internet and soon went viral. The discussion was noted for its civility, in contrast to the explosive character of several other discussions between members of the 111th Congress and their constituents that had occurred over the summer.

During the debate on health care reform, Franken was one of the strongest supporters of a single-payer system. He authored an amendment to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act called the Medical Loss Ratio, which required that insurance companies spend at least 80% of premiums on actual health care costs, and 85% for large group plans. On September 30, 2013, Franken voted to remove a provision that would repeal Obamacare&#x27;s medical device tax from a government funding bill, saying that though he supported the provision, he disagreed with its being used as a condition for preventing the 2013 federal government shutdown.

Citing the case of Jamie Leigh Jones, Franken introduced a limit to the arbitration policy of the 2010 Defense Appropriations bill that withheld defense contracts from companies that restrict their employees from taking workplace sexual assault, battery, and discrimination cases to court. It passed the Senate in November 2010, 68 to 30, in a roll-call vote.

In May 2010 Franken proposed a financial-reform amendment that created a board to select which credit rating agency would evaluate a given security. At the time, any company issuing a security could select the company that evaluated the security. The amendment passed, but the financial industry lobbied to have it removed from the final bill. Negotiations between the Senate and House, whose version of financial reform did not include such a provision, resulted in the amendment&#x27;s being watered down to require only a series of studies being done on the issue for two years. After the studies, if the Securities and Exchange Commission had not implemented another solution to the conflict-of-interest problem, Franken&#x27;s solution would go into effect.

In August 2010, Franken made faces and hand gestures and rolled his eyes while Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered a speech in opposition to the confirmation of Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court. McConnell responded, &quot;This isn&#x27;t &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Al.&quot; After Kagan&#x27;s confirmation, Franken delivered a handwritten apology to McConnell and issued a public statement saying that McConnell had a right &quot;to give his speech with the presiding officer just listening respectfully&quot;.

The &quot;National Journal&quot; reported in 2013 that Franken supported the National Security Agency&#x27;s data mining programs, believing they had saved lives, and that &quot;I can assure you, this is not about spying on the American people.&quot;

In 2013, Franken received the Stewart B. McKinney Award for his work fighting homelessness.

When Franken declared his intention to seek reelection in 2014, his seat was thought to be a top target for the Republicans because of his very slim margin of victory in 2008. But &quot;Politico&quot; reported that his high approval rating, his large campaign fund, and the Republicans&#x27; struggle to find a top-tier candidate meant he was a &quot;heavy favorite&quot; to win reelection, and Franken won the race comfortably.

In 2015, during Loretta Lynch&#x27;s confirmation hearings, Franken asked her about the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, reiterating concern for the aggressive prosecution of Aaron Swartz in &quot;United States v. Swartz&quot;.

The Associated Press noted in 2013 that, contrary to expectations, Franken did not seek out the media spotlight: &quot;He rarely talks to the Washington press corps, has shed his comedic persona and focused on policy, working to be taken seriously.&quot; In interviews he expressed his desire to be known for a focus on constituency work, keeping his head down, and working hard.

Franken was an effective fundraiser for the Democrats. By late 2015, his political action committee had raised more than $5million in donations. In 2016, his PAC raised $3.3million. According to &quot;The Star Tribune&quot;, Franken was able to &quot;draw crowds and donations across the country&quot;.

Franken condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to the crisis.

In September 2016, in advance of UN Security Council resolution 2334 condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, Franken signed an AIPAC-sponsored letter urging Obama to veto &quot;one-sided&quot; resolutions against Israel. Franken supported an Anti-Boycott Act, which would make it legal for U.S. states to refuse to do business with contractors that engage in boycotts against Israel.

In July 2017 Franken voted in favor of the Countering America&#x27;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act that placed sanctions on Iran, Russia, and North Korea.

=== Sexual misconduct allegations ===

On November 16, 2017, radio broadcaster and model Leeann Tweeden alleged in a blog post and an interview with her radio station, 790 KABC, that Franken kissed her on a 2006 USO tour during a rehearsal for a skit. She wrote, &quot;I said &#x27;OK&#x27; so he would stop badgering me. We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth.&quot; She said she pushed him away, feeling &quot;disgusted and violated&quot;. Roger Stone circulated news of the allegations to right-wing media.
During the 2006 tour, Franken was photographed holding his hands above Tweeden&#x27;s breasts while she was asleep wearing body armor and a helmet. In Franken&#x27;s defense, CNBC&#x27;s John Harwood said, &quot;That pic was obviously a joke, not groping, just like LeeAnn Tweeden wrapping her leg around Robin Williams and smacking his butt; entertainment for soldiers deployed overseas is raunchy like that.&quot; Harwood was referring to video taken of Tweeden &quot;humping&quot; the married Williams on a similar 2004 USO tour.

In response, Franken said, &quot;I certainly don&#x27;t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann ... As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn&#x27;t. I shouldn&#x27;t have done it.&quot; A few hours later, Franken issued a longer apology, which Tweeden accepted.

In the days that followed, seven additional women came forward with allegations of inappropriate behavior during photo ops. Lindsay Menz accused Franken of touching her clothed &quot;upper&quot; buttocks while they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two anonymous women made similar complaints related to events during political events. Franken apologized, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve met tens of thousands of people and taken thousands of photographs, often in crowded and chaotic situations. I&#x27;m a warm person; I hug people. I&#x27;ve learned from recent stories that in some of those encounters, I crossed a line for some women—and I know that any number is too many.&quot; Another anonymous woman said that after she was a guest on Franken&#x27;s radio show in 2006, Franken leaned in toward her face during a handshake and gave her &quot;a wet, open-mouthed kiss&quot; on the cheek when she turned her face aside. The same day, Stephanie Kemplin, an army veteran, told CNN that Franken held the side of her breast for 5 to 10 seconds &quot;and never moved his hand&quot; while posing for a photograph with her during a 2003 USO tour in Iraq.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sent Tweeden&#x27;s accusations to the Senate Ethics Committee for review, a decision supported by members of both parties, including Franken. On November 30 the committee announced that it was investigating allegations against him. Some liberal groups and commentators, including the Indivisible movement and Sally Kohn, called on Franken to resign. On December 6, two more accusations surfaced, one by an anonymous congressional aide about an attempted kiss at his radio show studio, and one by congressional aide Tina Dupuy that Franken squeezed her waist at a party before he took office. More than two dozen Democratic senators, led by New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, called on Franken to resign before the ethics committee could review the allegations.

==== Resignation ====
Although Franken had asked to be allowed to appear before the Senate Ethics Committee to give his side of the story, on December 6 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told him he had to announce his resignation by five o’clock or he could be censured and stripped of committee assignments. On December 7, Franken announced his intention to resign his Senate seat. He called some of the accusations &quot;simply not true&quot; and said he remembered others &quot;very differently&quot;. In his resignation speech he made comparisons to Republican politicians, saying he was &quot;aware of the irony&quot; that President Trump remained in office despite the comments Trump made in the &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape released a month before his election, and that the Republican Party supported Roy Moore&#x27;s Senate campaign despite the many allegations of harassment and molestation against Moore. Franken resigned on January 2, 2018, and Minnesota governor Mark Dayton appointed the lieutenant governor, Tina Smith, to Franken&#x27;s seat until a November 2018 special election, which Smith won.

====Aftermath====
After resigning from the Senate, Franken canceled appointments with close friends and ignored phone calls from others. &quot;It got pretty dark, I became clinically depressed. I wasn&#x27;t a hundred percent cognitively. I needed medication&quot;, he said.

Reporting in 2019 by &quot;New Yorker&quot; journalist Jane Mayer documented substantial inaccuracies in Tweeden&#x27;s allegations. Seven former or current senators who called for Franken&#x27;s resignation in 2017 told Mayer they regretted doing so. Patrick Leahy said calling for Franken&#x27;s resignation without having all the facts was &quot;one of the biggest mistakes I&#x27;ve made&quot; as a senator. New Mexico senator Tom Udall said, &quot;I made a mistake. I started having second thoughts shortly after he stepped down. He had the right to be heard by an independent investigative body. I&#x27;ve heard from people around my state, and around the country, saying that they think he got railroaded. It doesn&#x27;t seem fair. I&#x27;m a lawyer. I really believe in due process.&quot; Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, &quot;It&#x27;s terrible what happened to him. It was unfair. It took the legs out from under him. He was a very fine senator.&quot;

Accusations that the forced resignation was unfair were described as a liability to Gillibrand&#x27;s presidential campaign in mid-2019. In a 2018 &quot;Politico&quot; article, Franken supporters accused Gillibrand of doing damage that Republicans could not have done, given Franken&#x27;s effectiveness in the Senate. Prominent Democratic fundraiser Susie Tompkins Buell said that the episode &quot;stained [Gillibrand&#x27;s] reputation as a fair player. I do hear people refer to Kirsten Gillibrand as &#x27;opportunistic&#x27; and shrewd at the expense of others to advance herself, and it seems to have been demonstrated in her rapid treatment of her colleague Al Franken. I heard her referred to as &#x27;She would eat her own,&#x27; and she seems to have demonstrated that. I know [Gillibrand] thought she was doing the right thing, but I think she will be remembered by this rush to judgment. I have heard [that] some of her women colleagues regret joining her.&quot;

In 2019, Franken said that he was sorry that he made some women feel uncomfortable, and that while he was still trying to understand what he did wrong, he felt that differentiating dissimilar kinds of behavior is important. &quot;The idea that anybody who accuses someone of something is always right—that&#x27;s not the case. That isn&#x27;t reality,&quot; he said.

In September 2019, a ninth accuser told &quot;New York&quot; magazine that in 2006 Franken touched her buttock in a photo line at an event for Patty Murray. The unnamed woman, described as a &quot;former staffer who served on Democratic campaigns and works at a large progressive organization&quot;, said she had not come forward because she feared it would be held against her in her career. In response, Franken told &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;Two years ago, I would have sworn that I&#x27;d never done anything to make anyone feel uncomfortable, but it&#x27;s clear that I must have been doing something. As I&#x27;ve said before, I feel terrible that anyone came away from an interaction with me feeling bad.&quot;

In a February 9, 2022, interview with &quot;Washington Post Live&quot;, Franken said he regretted resigning from the Senate and might run for public office again.

== Post-Senate career ==
After his resignation, Franken went into a period of self-imposed isolation and, in May 2019, started &quot;The Al Franken Podcast&quot;. Around the same time, Franken went on tour with a non-comedic show that he did from a podium and with notes. The COVID-19 pandemic put the show on hold, but when clubs reopened, he made unannounced shows at the Comedy Cellar in Manhattan. In the fall of 2021, his first post-quarantine theater show took place in Northampton, Massachusetts, in front of a friendly audience. The solo show, called &quot;The Only Former US Senator Currently on Tour Tour&quot;, continued into 2022. In March 2023, Franken guest-hosted &quot;The Daily Show&quot; after Trevor Noah&#x27;s departure.

== Personal life ==
Franken met his wife, Franni Bryson, during his first year at Harvard. In 2005 they moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota. They have a daughter, a son, and four grandchildren. Their daughter, Thomasin, has degrees from Harvard and the French Culinary Institute; as of 2011 she was the director of extended learning at DC Prep, an organization in Washington, D.C., that manages charter schools. Their son, Joseph, works in the finance industry. Franken is a second cousin of the actor Steve Franken, known for his appearances in the television series &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;.

Franken has said that he &quot;very strongly&quot; identifies &quot;as a Jew as a pretty secular Jew&quot;. He has also said he believes in God.

In the summer of 2021, Franken moved back to New York City, settling on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

<text>The quart (symbol: qt) is a unit of volume equal to a quarter of a gallon. Three kinds of quarts are currently used: the liquid quart and dry quart of the US customary system and the of the British imperial system. All are roughly equal to one liter. It is divided into two pints or (in the US) four cups. Historically, the size of a quart has varied with the different values of gallons over time, and in the case of the dry quart, in reference to different commodities.

==Name==
The term comes from the Latin (meaning one-quarter) via the French . However, although the French word has the same root, it frequently means something entirely different. In Canadian French in particular, the quart is called , whilst the pint is called .

==History==

Since gallons of various sizes have historically been in use, the corresponding quarts have also existed with various sizes.

==Definitions and equivalencies==

=== Imperial quart ===
The imperial quart is equal to one-quarter of an imperial gallon of exactly , i.e. . In the United Kingdom, goods may be sold by the quart if the equivalent metric measure is also given.
In Canadian French, by federal law, the imperial quart is called .

===US liquid quart===
In the United States, traditional length and volume measures have been legally standardized for commerce by the international yard and pound agreement of 1959, using the definition of 1 yard being 0.9144 meters: from this definition the metric equivalents for inches, feet, miles, area measures, and measures of volume are determined. The US liquid quart is equal to one-quarter of a gallon of exactly 231 cubic inches, i.e. 57.75 cubic inches or .
=== US dry quart ===
In the United States, the dry quart is equal to of a US bushel of exactly 2150.42 cubic inches, i.e. 67.200625 cubic inches or . 
==Winchester quart==
The Winchester quart is an obsolescent measure: it was originally equal to two imperial quarts (half of an imperial gallon) or exactly , but was later metricated to (2.2 imperial quarts). Despite its name, it is unrelated to the Winchester measure.

The 2.5L bottles in which laboratory chemicals are supplied are sometimes referred to as Winchester quart bottles, although these contain 10% more than a traditional Winchester quart.

==Reputed quart==
The reputed quart was a measure equal to two-thirds of an imperial quart (one-sixth of an imperial gallon), or exactly 0.757681 liters, which is only 0.08% larger than one US fifth (exactly 0.7570823568 liters).

The reputed quart was previously recognized as a standard size of wine bottle in the United Kingdom, and is only about 1% larger than the current standard wine bottle of 0.75L.

<text>:&quot;This English mathematician is sometimes confused with the Irish mathematician William S. Burnside (1839–1920).&quot;


William Burnside (2 July 1852 – 21 August 1927) was an English mathematician. He is known mostly as an early researcher in the theory of finite groups.

Burnside was born in London in 1852. He went to school at Christ&#x27;s Hospital until 1871 and attended St. John&#x27;s and Pembroke Colleges at the University of Cambridge, where he was the Second Wrangler (bracketed with George Chrystal) in 1875. He lectured at Cambridge for the following ten years, before being appointed professor of mathematics at the Royal Naval College in Greenwich. While this was a little outside the main centres of British mathematical research, Burnside remained a very active researcher, publishing more than 150 papers in his career.

Burnside&#x27;s early research was in applied mathematics. This work was of sufficient distinction to merit his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1893, though it is little remembered today. Around the same time as his election his interests turned to the study of finite groups. This was not a widely studied subject in Britain in the late 19th century, and it took some years for his research in this area to gain widespread recognition.

The central part of Burnside&#x27;s group theory work was in the area of group representations, where he helped to develop some of the foundational theory, complementing, and sometimes competing with, the work of Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, who began his research in the subject during the 1890s. One of Burnside&#x27;s best known contributions to group theory is his &quot;paqb&quot; theorem, which shows that every finite group whose order is divisible by fewer than three distinct primes is solvable.

In 1897 Burnside&#x27;s classic work &quot;Theory of Groups of Finite Order&quot; was published. The second edition (pub. 1911) was for many decades the standard work in the field. A major difference between the editions was the inclusion of character theory in the second.

Burnside is also remembered for the formulation of Burnside&#x27;s problem that concerns the question of bounding the size of a group if there are fixed bounds both on the order of all of its elements and the number of elements needed to generate it, and also for Burnside&#x27;s lemma (a formula relating the number of orbits of a permutation group acting on a set with the number of fixed points of each of its elements) though the latter had been discovered earlier and independently by Frobenius and Augustin Cauchy.

He received an honorary doctorate (D.Sc.) from the University of Dublin in June 1901.

In addition to his mathematical work, Burnside was a noted rower. While he was a lecturer at Cambridge, he also coached the rowing crew team. In fact, his obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; took more interest in his athletic career, calling him &quot;one of the best known Cambridge athletes of his day&quot;.

He is buried at the West Wickham Parish Church in South London.

<text>The northern gannet (Morus bassanus) is a seabird, the largest species of the gannet family, Sulidae. It is native to the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean, breeding in Western Europe and Northeastern North America. It is the largest seabird in the northern Atlantic. The sexes are similar in appearance. The adult northern gannet has a mainly white streamlined body with a long neck, and long and slender wings. It is long with a wingspan. The head and nape have a buff tinge that is more prominent in breeding season, and the wings are edged with dark brown-black feathers. The long, pointed bill is blue-grey, contrasting with black, bare skin around the mouth and eyes. Juveniles are mostly grey-brown, becoming increasingly white in the five years it takes them to reach maturity.

Nesting takes place in colonies on both sides of the North Atlantic, the largest of which are at Bass Rock (75,000 pairs as of 2014), St. Kilda (60,000 pairs as of 2013) and Ailsa Craig (33,000 pairs as of 2014) in Scotland, Grassholm in Wales, and Bonaventure Island (60,000 pairs in 2009) off the coast of Quebec. Its breeding range has extended northward and eastward, with colonies being established on Russia&#x27;s Kola Peninsula in 1995 and Bear Island (the southernmost island of Svalbard), in 2011. Colonies are mostly located on offshore islands with cliffs, from which the birds can more easily launch into the air. The northern gannet undertakes seasonal migrations and catches fish (which are the mainstay of its diet) by making high-speed dives into the sea.

The northern gannet was previously hunted for food in certain parts of its range, and although that practice still continues in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland and the Faroe Islands, the bird faces few other natural or man-made threats. Since its population is growing, the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers it a least-concern species. Because it is both a conspicuous and a common bird, it is referred to in several ancient myths and legends.

==Taxonomy==
The Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner gave the northern gannet the name &quot;Anser bassanus&quot; or &quot;scoticus&quot; in the 16th century, and noted that the Scots called it a &quot;solendguse&quot;. The former name was also used by the English naturalist Francis Willughby in the 17th century; the species was known to him from a colony in the Firth of Forth and from a stray bird that was found near Coleshill, Warwickshire. It was one of the many species originally described by the Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, where it was given the binomial name &quot;Pelecanus bassanus&quot;. The French biologist Brisson placed it in the genus &quot;Sula&quot; in 1760, and his compatriot Louis Pierre Vieillot moved the species to his new genus &quot;Morus&quot; in 1816. &quot;Morus&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;moros&quot;, meaning &quot;foolish&quot;, and refers to the lack of fear shown by breeding gannets and boobies, which enables them to be easily killed. The specific name &quot;bassanus&quot; is from the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth. The ornithologist Bryan Nelson in 1978 supported the species&#x27; inclusion in &quot;Sula&quot; as he felt the differences in anatomy, behaviour, ecology and morphology between gannets and boobies were not sufficient to warrant separate genera.

Charles Lucien Bonaparte described the American populations as &quot;Sula americana&quot; in 1838, though the basis for distinguishing them from the European species was unclear and the name is now considered to be a synonym.

&quot;Northern gannet&quot; has been designated as the official common name for the species by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC). It is also known as the North Atlantic gannet. &quot;Gannet&quot; is derived from Old English &quot;ganot&quot;, meaning &quot;strong or masculine&quot;, which is ultimately from the same Old Germanic root as &quot;gander&quot;. &quot;Soland goose&quot; and similar old names for the northern gannet such as &quot;solan&quot; or &quot;solan goose&quot; derive from a hypothetical Scottish Gaelic &quot;sulan&quot;, itself borrowed from the Old Norse &quot;sula&quot;. The literal meaning is &quot;cleft stick&quot;, referring to the appearance of the conspicuous crossed black wing tips on a perched northern gannet. Old regional names such as Norfolk&#x27;s &quot;herring gant&quot; or Yorkshire&#x27;s &quot;mackerel gant&quot; refer to typical fish prey. Lincolnshire&#x27;s &quot;gaunt&quot;, although derived from the same Germanic root, usually applies to the great crested grebe, but the English writer Richard Hakluyt used the term in 1600 to refer to the gannet, &quot;a great White foule&quot;. Young birds have been called &quot;spotted booby&quot; or &quot;parliament goose&quot;, the former term referring to their plumage. The feeding habits of the gannet have led to its name being used as slang for a gluttonous person, a usage first recorded in 1929.

The Sulidae, the gannets and boobies, appeared about 30 million years ago. Early Sulidae fossils resembled the boobies, although they were more aquatic, the gannets splitting off later, about 16 million years ago. The gannets evolved in the northern hemisphere, later colonising the southern oceans. The most ancient extant species may be the Abbott&#x27;s booby, possibly the sole survivor of an otherwise extinct separate lineage. A 2011 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA suggests that the ancestor of the gannets arose around 2.5 million years ago before splitting into northern and southern lineages. The latter then split into the Cape and Australasian gannets around 0.5 million years ago. The three gannets are generally considered to be separate species forming a superspecies, though they have also formerly been classified as subspecies of &quot;Sula bassanus&quot;.

== Description ==
An adult northern gannet has a wingspan, and is long and weighs , making it the largest gannet and the largest seabird native to the western Palearctic. The two sexes are generally of a similar size and appearance. The plumage is white with dark brown to black wing tips; the primary flight feathers, primary coverts and alulae are dark. The head and neck are tinged buff-yellow, becoming much more prominent in the breeding season. Males are more deeply coloured than females. The eyes are surrounded by black bare skin and have a cobalt blue orbital ring, the iris is light blue-grey with a fine dark outer ring. In birds that survive avian influenza, the irises become black.

The beak is long, strong and conical with a slight downcurve at the end and a sharp cutting edge. In adults, the beak is blue-grey with dark grey or black edges. There is a black groove running the length of the mandible that merges into the skin around the eyes. A black band of bare skin also separates the pale feathers of the forehead and throat from the bill, which gives the gannet its distinctive face markings. The four-toed feet are joined by a membrane that can vary in colour from dark grey to dark brown. There are coloured lines running along the toes that continue along up the legs. These are typically greenish-yellow in males and bluish in females and probably have a role in mating.
Fledglings are dark grey to slate-grey with upperparts and wings finely speckled with white. There is a prominent V-shaped white area under the rump. The wing tips and tail are dark brown-black, partly tipped with white. The bill and iris are dark brown. They can weigh more than by the time they leave the nest at about 10 weeks of age. In the second year, the bird&#x27;s appearance changes depending on the different phases of moulting: they can have adult plumage at the front and continue to be brown at the rear. Gannets gradually acquire more white in subsequent seasons until they reach maturity after five years.


Northern gannets are slightly larger and thicker-billed than Cape or Australian gannets. The northern gannet has more white in the wings and an all-white tail, the other species having black tips to their tail feathers. Individuals on the west coast of Africa could be confused with vagrant masked boobies, though the latter is smaller overall, lacks the buff tinge to the head, and has a black tail. From a distance, or in poor visibility, albatrosses can be confused with northern gannets, particularly those with immature plumage that have more black on the wings.

=== Adaptations for diving ===
Northern gannets have streamlined bodies adapted for plunge-diving at high speed, including powerful neck muscles, and a spongy bone plate at the base of the bill. The nostrils are inside the bill and can be closed to prevent water entry; the eyes are protected by strong nictitating membranes. There are subcutaneous air sacs in the lower body and along the sides. Other air sacs are located between the sternum and the pectoral muscles and between the ribs and the intercostal muscles. These sacs are connected to the lungs and are filled with air when the bird breathes in. The air can be returned to the lungs by muscle contractions.

The feathers are waterproof, which allows the birds to spend long periods in water. A water-impermeable secretion produced by a sebaceous gland covers the feathers and the birds spread it across their body using their beak or head. Individuals have a subcutaneous fat layer, dense down feathers and tightly overlapping feathers that help them withstand low temperatures. A reduced blood flow in the webbing on their feet outside of the breeding season also helps to maintain body temperature when the birds swim.

=== Call ===
The northern gannet is a loud and vocal bird, particularly in the colony. Its typical call is a harsh &quot;arrah-arrah&quot; or &quot;urrah-urrah&quot;, which is emitted upon arriving or when challenging other gannets at the colony. The call is shortened to a &quot;rah&quot; &quot;rah&quot; when fishing or collecting nesting material, and lengthened to a &quot;ooo-ah&quot; when taking off. The calls of the sexes are similar. According to Nelson northern gannets can recognize the call of their breeding partner, their chicks and birds in neighbouring nests. Individuals from outside this sphere are treated with more aggression.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The northern gannet&#x27;s breeding range is on both sides of the North Atlantic on coasts influenced by the Gulf Stream, There are colonies in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and on the islands off the east coast of Canada. They normally nest in large colonies, on cliffs overlooking the ocean or on small rocky islands. The water needs to be cool enough for Atlantic mackerel and herring, which are the main food source for the northern gannet. These areas also overlie the continental shelf. Northern gannet colonies can be found in the far north in regions that are very cold and stormy, and Nelson has suggested that they can survive in these regions for several reasons, including the combination of body weight and a powerful beak that allows them to capture strong muscular fish, and the ability to dive to great depths and capture prey far from the cliffs. Their fat reserves act as weight when diving and as reserves during extended periods without food.

The northern limit of their breeding area depends on the presence of waters that are free of sea ice during the breeding season. Therefore, while Greenland and Svalbard offer suitable breeding sites, the Arctic regions have summers that are too short to allow the northern gannets to lay their eggs and raise a brood, which requires between 26 and 30 weeks. The southern limit of their distribution mainly depends on the presence of sufficient prey. There is fossil evidence of northern gannets breeding on Crete in the Pleistocene.

===Breeding colonies===

Some northern gannet breeding colonies have been recorded as being located in the same place for hundreds of years. The cliffs containing the colonies appear white when seen from a distance, due to the number of nesting birds present on them. There is a written record of a colony on the island of Lundy from 1274. There were only 70 nests by 1871, and the colony finally disappeared by 1909 at the latest. More than two-thirds of the world population breeds around the coasts of the British Isles. Colonies include:

*Scotland
:* Bass Rock, in the Firth of Forth, first recorded in 1493. In 2004, it contained more than 48,000 nests. By 2014 this had increased to over 75,000, making it the largest colony in the world.
:* Northern gannets began a colony at Troup Head in Aberdeenshire in 1988, and by 2014 it held an estimated 6,456 pairs.
:* Saint Kilda and Sula Sgeir, in the Hebrides, Scotland. The former colony was estimated at 60,290 pairs and the latter 11,230 pairs in 2013. A colony on the Flannan Isles almost doubled in size to 5,280 pairs in 2013. Further south, the island of Ailsa Craig in the Firth of Clyde hosted an estimated 33,226 pairs in 2014. Ailsa Craig has been known as a colony since 1583.
:* In Shetland, there were an estimated 25,580 breeding pairs at Hermaness, 11,786 on Noss, and 3,591 on Fair Isle in 2013, while Orkney had an estimated 4,550 pairs at Sule Stack. Sule Skerry&#x27;s breeding population rose from 57 to 1,870 pairs between 2003 and 2013.
*Wales
:* Grassholm off the Pembrokeshire coast in Wales had an estimated 36,011 pairs in 2015. Gannets began nesting here between 1820 and 1860, though never in great numbers, only exceeding 300 pairs by 1913.
*England
:* Bempton Cliffs hosted an estimated 12,494 pairs in 2015, more than tripling in size in 12 years.
*Ireland 

:*Little Skellig, a small island located about off the Iveragh Peninsula of County Kerry is the largest colony in Ireland, hosting around 30,000 breeding pairs. Known as a gannetry before 1700, human impact had reduced the population to 30 pairs by 1880 before rapidly increasing to around 10,000 pairs by 1906, the fastest recovery ever recorded at a gannet colony. There are small colonies on Ireland&#x27;s southern coast, on Bull Rock, County Cork, Clare Island, County Mayo and Great Saltee Island, County Wexford.
*Alderney. Around 7,500 pairs nest on two islets—Ortac and Les Etacs—off the coast of Alderney in the English Channel, the first birds only nesting there in the 1940s. These birds migrate further south to the Mediterranean and west coast of Africa than more northerly breeding colonies.
*France. The French island of Rouzic in the Jentilez archipelago off the coast of Brittany hosts the southernmost breeding colony of northern gannets. Established in the late 1930s, it had grown to over 11,500 breeding pairs by 1995. Pairs have nested sporadically with varying success along the Mediterranean coast.
*Germany. Northern gannets have reappeared on Heligoland in 1991 and around 680 breeding pairs have been counted in 2016.
*Italy. A pair raised a chick successfully for three successive seasons from 2013 to 2015 on a moored boat at Porto Venere in northern Italy, after birds had been seen there since 1993.
*The Faroe Islands. Mykines in the Faroe Islands held about 2,000 breeding pairs in 2000, although that had risen to 2,500 pairs by 2014.
*Iceland. Eldey, a small island located about off the coast of the Reykjanesskagi Peninsula, Iceland, hosting around 16,300 breeding pairs in 1962, and a similar number in 2008. Iceland has several small colonies along its coast, and on Grimsey, around north.
*Norway. As of 2016, there are an estimated 6,900 breeding pairs in Norway. Northern gannets first bred in the south of the country in the mid 1940s at Runde in Møre og Romsdal. In 1967 a colony was established at Syltefjord, within the Arctic Circle at 70°N. Colonies were also established on low islets in Lofoten and Vesterålen, but declined due to increasing numbers of white-tailed eagles. Once rare, these were protected in 1968 and their numbers have risen. It is unclear why the eagles have not impacted on gannet numbers further north. In 2011, gannets began breeding on Bear Island, southernmost island of Svalbard, likely due to the warming of the Barents Sea and influx of fish. The colony numbered 52 pairs in 2016.
*Russia. There are around 250 pairs in a colony at Kharlov on the Kola Peninsula in Russia. Established in 1995, this is also thought to be due to the warming of the Barents Sea.
*North America. There are six breeding colonies along the coast of Canada. The Gulf of Saint Lawrence hosts three colonies—Bonaventure Island, Bird Rocks and Anticosti Island—and there are three off the eastern and southeastern coast of Newfoundland (Cape St. Mary&#x27;s Ecological Reserve, Funk Island, Baccalieu Island Ecological Reserve. Bonaventure Island off the south coast of the Gaspé Peninsula of Quebec is the largest colony with 60,000 nests as of 2009.

=== Migration ===
After the breeding season, adult northern gannets disperse over a wide area although they travel no more than from the breeding colony. It is not known if all birds from one colony migrate to the same over-wintering area. Many adults migrate to the west of the Mediterranean, passing over the Strait of Gibraltar and flying over land as little as possible. Other birds follow Africa&#x27;s Atlantic coastline to arrive in the Gulf of Guinea. Immature northern gannets from colonies in Canada fly to the Gulf of Mexico, much further south than the adults.
The immature gannets migrate southwards for great distances and have been recorded as far south as Ecuador. In their second year some birds return to the colony they were born in, where they arrive later than the mature birds. They then migrate south again at the end of the breeding season, but travel shorter distances in this second migration. Gannets from Alderney have been tracked since 2015 to gain better knowledge of their movements. One individual was found to have travelled from its colony in Alderney to Scandinavian waters, a round trip of around .

The species has been recorded as a vagrant in many central and eastern European countries as far south and west as the Black Sea, and also in Bermuda, Cuba, Cyprus, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Jan Mayen and Syria. In February 2016, one was recorded from Ceará in northeastern Brazil—the first sighting in the Southern Hemisphere.

== Behaviour ==

The wings of the northern gannet are long and narrow and are positioned towards the front of the body, allowing efficient use of air currents when flying. Even in calm weather they can attain velocities of between although their flying muscles are relatively small: in other birds flying muscles make up around 20% of total weight, while in northern gannets the flying muscles are less than 13%. Despite their speed, they cannot manoeuvre in flight as well as other seabirds. Northern gannets need to warm up before flying. They also walk with difficulty and this means that they have problems getting airborne from a flat area. They take off from water by facing into the wind and strongly beating their wings. In light winds and high waves they are sometimes unable to take off and they can become beached.

Northern gannets alight on land using angled wings, fanned tail and raised feet to control their speed, not always successfully, since damaged or broken wings were recorded as a frequent cause of death in adults at one colony.

=== Feeding ===
Northern gannets forage for food during the day, generally by diving at high speed into the sea. They search for food both near to their nesting sites but also further out to sea. Birds that are feeding young have been recorded searching for food up to from their nest. It has been found that 2% of birds nesting in the colony on Bass Rock search for fish at Dogger Bank, between away. It is likely that they fly further than this while foraging, possibly up to double the distance; normally they fly less than . Some studies have found that the duration and direction of flights made while foraging for food are similar for both sexes, although there are significant differences in the search behaviour of males and females. Female northern gannets are not only more selective than males in choosing a search area: they also make longer and deeper dives and spend more time floating on the surface than males. 

Gannets will follow fishing boats or cetaceans to find discarded or injured fish.
They forage from heights of up to with no clear preference, and typically dive between . They dive with their bodies straight and rigid, wings tucked close to the body but angled back, extending beyond the tail, before piercing the water like an arrow. They control the direction of the dive using their wings and tail, and fold their wings against the body just before impact. Birds can hit the water at speeds of up to . This allows them to penetrate up to below the surface, and they will swim down to an average , sometimes deeper than . The bird&#x27;s subcutaneous air sacs may have a role in controlling their buoyancy.

Gannets usually push their prey deeper into the water and capture it as they return to the surface. When a dive is successful, they swallow the fish underwater before surfacing, and never fly with the fish in their bill. Larger fish are swallowed headfirst, smaller fish are swallowed sideways or tail-first. The fish is stored in a branched bag in the throat and does not cause drag when in flight.
Their white colour helps other gannets to identify one of their kind and they can deduce the presence of a shoal of fish by this diving behaviour; this in turn facilitates group foraging, which makes capturing their prey easier. The colour also makes the gannet less visible to the fish underneath. Northern gannets also forage for fish while swimming with their head under water.

They eat mainly fish in length that shoal near the surface. Virtually any small fish (roughly 80–90% of their diet) or other small pelagic species (largely squid) will be taken opportunistically. Sardines, anchovies, haddock, smelt, Atlantic cod and other shoal-forming species are also eaten. &quot;M. bassanus&quot; takes huge quantities from the waters around Newfoundland for the energy requirements of their growing chicks. Given the economic importance of the prey taken, whether they are in competition with human fishing industry in the area is an important question which remains unassessed. (But given the small amount taken, NL&#x27;s cod take is probably unaffected.) On the other hand, they profit off of discarded bycatch and processed parts and the reduction in competition if humans are taking predatory fish.

&quot;M. bassanus&quot; inflicts significant wastage on the northwest Atlantic &quot;Salmo salar&quot; fishery, but does not actually eat much of them. This makes it difficult to resolve this conflict with the fishing industry in the area, as the only option would be to exterminate the birds, which is ecologically unacceptable.

=== Breeding ===

The oldest birds are the first to return to the northern gannet&#x27;s breeding colonies. Birds not of breeding age arrive a few weeks later. In general, birds first return to a colony (not uncommonly the one in which they were hatched) when they are two or three years old. Once an individual has successfully bred in a colony it will not normally change to another. Nesting starts in March or April.

Immature birds stay on the edges of the colony. They may even make a nest but they do not breed until they are 4 or 5 years old. Some birds of this age occupy empty nests that they will aggressively defend if they have sat on them for two or three days. If an apparently empty nest has an owner, the immature bird will leave without a struggle when the owner arrives to take possession.

The preferred nesting sites are on coastal hillsides or cliffs. If these are not available northern gannets will nest in groups on islands or flat surfaces. As they find it more difficult to take off from such locations they will often cross the area occupied by an adjacent nest causing an aggressive reaction from the sitting pair; this means that the stress levels are higher in this type of colony than in those on steeper surfaces. Notwithstanding this, nests are always built close together and otherwise ideal nesting sites will not be used if they are some distance from a colony. On average there are 2.3 nests per square metre (1.9 per square yard). Both sexes fiercely defend the area around their nest. Where space allows, the distance between nests is double the reach of an individual.

Nests are made from seaweed, plants, earth and debris from the sea. The males usually collect the materials. Nests are compact cups typically in height. The area which a nest occupies grows throughout the breeding season as the breeding pairs throw their excrement outside the nest. Over years, nests can reach in height.

Northern gannets lay one egg that on average weighs , which is light for such a large seabird. The egg is around long by wide and the shell is pale blue and translucent initially before fading to a chalky white surface that is easily stained. &quot;M. bassanus&quot; was among those birds most affected by the shell-thinning effect of DDT, which contributed in large degree to its ban. Where two eggs are found in a nest this is the result of two females laying an egg in the same nest or one egg being stolen from another nest. Northern gannets will lay a replacement egg if the first is lost. Incubation takes 42 to 46 days, during which time the egg is surrounded by the brooding bird&#x27;s warm, webbed feet. Just before hatching begins, the brooding bird releases the egg from its feet to prevent the egg from breaking under the adult&#x27;s weight as the chick breaks it open. This is a frequent cause of death for chicks of birds that are breeding for the first time. The process of breaking the eggshell can take up to 36 hours. The webbed feet are also used to cover the chicks, which are only rarely left alone by their parents. Chicks that are left unattended are often attacked and killed by other northern gannets.

Newly hatched chicks are featherless and are dark blue or black in colour. In the second week of life they are covered in white down, replaced over the next five weeks by dark brown feathers flecked with white. Young chicks are fed regurgitated semi-digested fish by their parents, who open their mouths wide for their young to fetch the food from the back of their throats. Older chicks receive whole fish. Unlike the chicks of other species, northern gannet chicks do not move about the nest or flap their wings to ask for food: this reduces the likelihood that they will fall from the nest.

The adults feed their offspring for around 13 weeks, right up until the time they leave. The young birds fledge between 84 and 97 days old, departing by launching themselves off a cliff and flying—a procedure for which it is impossible to practice beforehand. If they leave the nest in bad weather they can be mortally wounded as they can be blown against the rocks. The young birds are attacked by adults if unattended. Once they leave the nest they stay at sea learning to fish and fly, their flight skills being too poor for them to return to the breeding ledges.

Northern gannets have only one brood a year. The survival rate for young birds for their first four years is 30% and the annual survival rate for adults is 91.9%. The typical lifespan after becoming adult is 17 years, and the maximum known age is 37 years 4 months 16 days. Gannet pairs are monogamous and may remain together over several seasons, if not for all of their lives. The pairs separate when their chicks leave the nest but they bond again the following year. Should one of the pair die, the other bird will find another mate.

===Displays===
Northern gannets exhibit many types of aggressive behaviour while they are nesting. Confrontations normally only take place between birds of the same sex. Females will lower their heads before an aggressive male that is defending its nest: this will expose the back of the female&#x27;s neck and the male will take it in its beak and expel the female from the nest. A female will not react if a male approaches a nest but it will react fiercely if another female approaches. The fights between males occupying nests for the first time are particularly intense. Such fights can last for up to two hours and lead to serious injuries. Birds lunge at each other and lock bills, wrestling for extended periods while neighbours peck at them. The fights are preceded by threatening gestures, which are also seen outside the breeding season. Males demonstrate ownership of a nest by gesturing towards their neighbours in a &quot;bowing display&quot;; their heads and beaks point down, and their wings are held up and away from the body, yet folded backwards. The male moves his head from side to side before bowing forwards.

Males try to attract an available female after establishing a territory. The females will fly over the colony several times before landing. Their posture, with the neck stretched out, tells the male that they are available for courtship. The male will then shake their heads in a similar way to when they are guarding their nest, but with their wings closed. Mated pairs engage in a &quot;fencing display&quot; when the male arrives back at the nest. The two birds stand breast to breast with wings spread and bills extended vertically. They fence and scissor with their bills rapidly, calling loudly at the same time. Fencing is interspersed with bill bowing.

== Predators and parasites ==

The northern gannet is not heavily predated. The only known habitual natural predators of adults are bald eagles, white-tailed eagles and golden eagles. Predators of eggs and nestlings include the great black-backed gull and American herring gull, common ravens, ermine, and red fox. Attacks at sea are insignificant, though large sharks and seals may rarely snatch a gannet out at sea.

Kleptoparasitism by skuas, particularly the great skua, occurs at breeding sites. The skua chases its victim until it disgorges its stomach contents, providing a meal for the attacker. Skuas may catch the tip of the gannet&#x27;s wing, causing it to fall into the sea, or seize the tail to tip its victim into the water. The gannet is only released when it has regurgitated its catch.

External parasites include feather lice, although there are relatively few species and none are found on the head. As with grebes and divers, it may be that the short head feathers provide insufficient cover for the parasite. In one species, &quot;Michaelichus bassani&quot;, immature lice are found in the membranes lining the subcutaneous air-cells. &quot;Ixodes&quot; mites include the widespread &quot;I. uriae&quot;.

The spiny-headed worm &quot;Corynosoma tunitae&quot; appears to occur only in gannets and closely related seabird families such as the cormorants. The tapeworm &quot;Tetrabothrius bassani&quot; absorbs toxic heavy metals at a higher concentration than the gannet&#x27;s own tissues, with an average 12 times as much cadmium as the gannet&#x27;s pectoral muscles and 7–10 times the lead level of the bird&#x27;s kidney and liver. Since levels of these toxic metals are detectable in the parasite earlier than in the host, the tapeworm might be used as an early indicator of marine pollution.

== Conservation status==

A 2004 survey counted 45 gannet breeding colonies and some 361,000 nests. The population is apparently growing between 3% and 5% a year, although this growth is concentrated in just a few colonies. Although northern gannet populations are now stable, their numbers were once greatly reduced due to loss of habitat, removal of eggs and killing of adults for their meat and feathers. In 1939, there were 22 colonies and some 83,000 nests, which means that the populations have increased fourfold since that time.

In 1992, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimated the bird&#x27;s population to be some 526,000. After taking into account an estimate produced for BirdLife International in 2004 of the European population, the IUCN revised its global population to between 950,000 and 1,200,000 individuals.

The IUCN lists northern gannets as a species of least concern, as they are widely distributed and as there is a large population that appears to be growing due to high breeding success, with 75% of eggs producing fledged young.

==In culture==
 In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the sea goddess Leucothea ( &quot;white goddess&quot;), appears &quot;in the likeness of a Gannet&quot; and tells the shipwrecked Odysseus to discard his cloak and raft, instead offering him her veil to wind round himself which will save his life and enable him to reach land.

Another early reference to the gannet is in the 7th-century Old English epic poem &quot;The Seafarer&quot;.

An old myth from Mykines in the Faroe Islands tells of the giant Tórur seeking mercy following defeat at the hands of Óli, the islanders&#x27; head man and magician. In return, he gave them whales, driftwood logs and a bird unique to the archipelago, on condition that the inhabitants did not laugh at his gifts. Over time, the islanders forgot their promise, and lost the whales and logs, but fearful of losing a valuable food source, they never mocked the gannets that Tórur had given them.

Northern gannets have long been eaten for food. Birds, mainly the young, were taken from Bass Rock for at least 350 years until 1885, when the annual cull of about 1,500 individuals finally ceased, and Shetland gannets were sold as &quot;Highland goose&quot; in London restaurants during World War II. Views of the palatability of this bird are mixed, but as well as being a food for the poor it also regularly featured in Scottish royal banquets. In Scotland gannets were traditionally salted to preserve them until they got to market, this technique being replaced by partially cooking or smoking in the era of modern transport. They are normally served roasted, although sometimes raw when pickled or dried. 

Although the Bass Rock population fell to fewer than 4,000 pairs in the early 19th century, the population soon recovered once hunting ceased, and St. Kilda was harvested sustainably for hundreds of years. Elsewhere, the recovery was less complete. The Bird Rocks colony in the Gulf of St Lawrence may once have held 250,000 birds, but unchecked hunting, including for fish bait, meant that the population was only 1,000 birds by 1932, despite government protection since 1904.

===St Kilda===
Among the best-known sites for harvesting historically was the remote island of St. Kilda, where adults and eggs were taken in the spring. The fat chicks, known locally as &quot;gugas&quot;, were harvested from the precipitous cliffs in August, just before they could fly, and thrown to waiting boats far below. Much of the meat was salted in barrels for storage, but the rest of the bird was also used. Islanders paid their rent in feathers for stuffing pillows and furniture, the gannet stomachs were used to hold oil derived from the carcasses, and the breastbones served as lamp wicks. Hunting on St. Kilda ceased in 1910. 

===Sula Sgeir===
The gannetry on Sula Sgeir is still exploited under a licence that permits 2,200 chicks to be taken each year. During the hunt, 10 men live on the island, and the cleaned birds are singed on a fire fuelled by their own oil-rich offal. The men typically come from the Ness area of the Isle of Lewis. The filleted birds are then taken to Stornoway, where each hunter receives 200 skins to give away or sell. The practice was described at length as part of the story in The Blackhouse, a novel by Scottish writer Peter May. The continuing existence of the practice of hunting and eating gannets attracts criticism in some quarters. The island&#x27;s name &quot;Sula Sgeir&quot; itself derives from &quot;sula&quot;, meaning &quot;gannet&quot;, and the Old Norse &quot;skerr&quot;, a skerry. Other sites that continued hunting into the 20th century were Eldey in Iceland, where the activity ceased in 1939, and Mykines, where small-scale culling still persists. About 500 young are culled for consumption each year in Mykines, using techniques similar to those of the Sula Sgeir hunts.

<text>A luxury [[car]] is a passenger vehicle providing above-average to high-end comfort levels, features, and equipment. More expensive materials and surface finishes are often used, and buyers expect better build quality. The usually higher pricing and more upscale appearance are often associated with the users&#x27; higher social status compared to low- and mid-market segment cars.

The term is relative and partially subjective, reflecting both objective qualities of a car, as well as the projected and perceived image of the vehicle&#x27;s marque. Luxury brands rank above &quot;premium brands&quot;, though there is no clear distinction between the two.

Most luxury cars were large, though smaller sports-oriented models were produced. &quot;Compact&quot; luxury vehicles such as hatchbacks and off-road capable sport utility vehicles are more recent expansions of luxury qualities in various cars.

== Classification standards ==
Several car classification schemes include a luxury category, such as:
* Australia: Since the year 2000, the Federal Government&#x27;s luxury car tax applies to new vehicles over a certain purchase price, with higher thresholds applying for cars considered as fuel efficient. As of 2019, the thresholds were approximately AU$66,000 (US$,000) for normal cars and AU$76,000 (US$,000) for fuel-efficient cars.
* Europe: Luxury cars are classified as F-segment vehicles in the European Commission classification scheme.
* Italy: The term &quot;auto di lusso&quot; is used for luxury cars.
* France: The term &quot;voiture de luxe&quot; is used for luxury cars.
* Germany: The term (&quot;upper class&quot;) is used for luxury cars.
* Russia: The term ( (&quot;&quot;representative class vehicle&quot;, also translated as &quot;luxury vehicle&quot;) is used for luxury cars.
* Rental cars: The ACRISS Car Classification Code is a system used by many car rental companies to define equivalent vehicles across brands. This system includes &quot;Luxury&quot; and &quot;Luxury Elite&quot; categories (along with &quot;Premium&quot; and &quot;Premium Elite&quot; categories). The criteria for a vehicle to be considered &quot;luxury&quot; is not published.
==Characteristics==
===Features===
Luxury cars have traditionally emphasized higher levels of comfort and safety. Manufacturers often introduce new safety technologies and comfort amenities on luxury models before they are available on more affordable models. Some brands, like Audi and BMW have expanded their marketing by &quot;introducing lesser priced and strip-down economy versions of their products.&quot;

Luxury vehicles can be a status symbol for conspicuous consumption. However, since many European luxury car buyers shy away from conspicuous consumption, brands offer buyers the option of removing exterior badges that identify the model name or engine size.

The suspension system of most luxury cars is tuned to prioritize ride quality over handling; however, some are marketed as &quot;sports luxury&quot; and have a greater emphasis on handling characteristics.

===Layout and powertrain===
Traditionally, luxury cars have used a front-engine, rear-wheel drive (FR) layout. The FR layout is more expensive to produce and produces lower fuel economy than a front-wheel drive layout; however, it allows for larger engines (particularly straight-six, V8, and V12) to be used.

Some American luxury cars during the 1970s through the 1990s switched to a front-wheel drive layout with a transverse engine provoked by the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973 and the 1979 oil crisis, which caused automakers to discontinue many FR platforms in favor of the more economical front-wheel drive (FF) layout. From the early 2000s, several of these American luxury cars reverted to FR layouts.

Since the introduction of the Bentley Continental GT in 2003, additional luxury grand tourers feature all-wheel drive.

== History ==

=== European manufacturers ===
Prior to World War II, a wide array of European producers made luxury cars, including Rolls-Royce, Bugatti, Delage, Delahaye, Talbot-Lago, Bentley, Alvis, Avions Voisin, Isotta Fraschini, Horch, Simson, Stoewer, Maybach, Mercedes-Benz, Hispano Suiza, Daimler Company, and Spyker.

France was a leading producer of powerful luxury automobiles before World War II. After World War II, the French government used &quot;puissance fiscale&quot; tax regulations to encourage manufacturers to build cars with small engines and French motorists to buy them. The Maserati-powered Citroën SM and the Citroën C6 were arguably the last domestic French luxury cars. In the 2010s, some French manufacturers have attempted to develop luxury cars; however the lack of a historical legacy has hindered these efforts. In 2014, Citroën introduced DS Automobiles sub-brand to market luxury cars.

Pre World War II, intermediate car manufacturers like Renault, Fiat, Opel, Lancia, Škoda, Riley, Praga, Peugeot, Hillman, and Tatra made luxury cars. However, they had to transition to produce economy cars and superminis post World War II. 

Following World War II, Germany rose to become an export powerhouse, building on success with the Mercedes-Benz brand. Aircraft engine manufacturer BMW, began making motorcycles, then small cars, including under license from the Austin Motor Company, and evolved into the luxury market segment ultimately acquiring Rolls-Royce Motor Cars in 1998. Volkswagen entered the high-end market by expanding or acquiring additional brands such as Audi, Porsche, Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti.

In the Soviet Union, the manufacturer ZiL (then called Zis) began producing representational limousines in the mid-1930s. In the early 1950s, GAZ joined with the somewhat smaller &quot;Chaika&quot; model range. In 2018, Aurus Motors was established to produce luxury vehicles for the Russian market.

===North American manufacturers===
The luxury car phenomenon began at the start of the automobile industry when the wealthy frequently invested in manufacturing such models to gain social prestige. Emphasis was also placed on custom-built coachwork. The 1920s and 1930s were the apogee of production of these very large luxury automobiles from many manufacturers. The significant North American manufacturers from 1910 until 1940 included Auburn, Buick, Cadillac, Chrysler, Continental, Cord, Daniels, DeSoto, Duesenberg, Franklin, Imperial, LaFayette, LaSalle, Lincoln, Marmon, Packard, Peerless, Pierce Arrow, Ruxton, Stearns-Knight, and Stutz. The Great Depression put many luxury car manufacturers out of business; others would hold on before going defunct during the postwar era.
From 1946 until the late 1990s, Cadillac was the top-selling brand of luxury cars in the U.S., while Lincoln was second. The most successful and long-running model names during this era were the Cadillac DeVille, Lincoln Continental, and the Chrysler Imperial. The Lincoln Mark Series and Cadillac Eldorado were positioned in the personal luxury category, and competition between them continued into the 1990s.

The personal luxury car emerged into mass popularity and affordability as an America-specific category of popularly-priced cars made from the 1950s by the four domestic manufacturers (GM, Ford, Chrysler, and AMC) that reached peak popularity in the 1970s. The cars were stylized, mass-produced two-door coupés or convertibles, relying on standard components. These distinctively styled cars were targeting the needs of individual customers, not an entire family. The longest running model lines were the 1958-1997 Ford Thunderbird, 1956-1998 Lincoln Mark Series, and the 1967-2002 Cadillac Eldorado.

In 1990, American luxury brands dominated, with Cadillac selling over a quarter-million cars, and Lincoln had its best year ever at 231,660 units. However, the market was changing with an ever greater acceptance of smaller, more efficient imported luxury brands while at the same time, the domestic manufacturers were downsizing their models with product decisions that backfired on quality and brand respect.

Since the late 1990s, Japanese and German brands have sold the most luxury-type cars in the United States. However, the Cadillac Escalade has led the luxury SUV segment sales in the United States since its introduction in 1998, with the highest sales for 15 out of its first 20 years on the market.
In the 2000s, both Ford and General Motors produced luxury pickups: 2002-2013 Cadillac Escalade EXT, 2002-2003 Lincoln Blackwood, and 2006-2014 Lincoln Mark LT.
In the late 2000s, the Cadillac CTS and Cadillac DTS led to a resurgence in the brand&#x27;s luxury sedans. The equivalent sedan from the Ford group, the 2008 Lincoln MKS, was also regarded as a significant improvement over previous models. In 2010, BMW was the best-selling luxury vehicle manufacturer by sales, with Audi and Mercedes-Benz the second and third highest selling luxury brands.
=== East Asian manufacturers ===
Chinese manufacturer Hongqi was launched in 1958, making it the oldest Chinese luxury car marque. Later newcomers joined taking advantage of the rise of electric powertrains, with NEV brands such as Nio in 2014, Lynk &amp; Co in 2016, HiPhi in 2019, and Zeekr in 2021 producing luxury electric and hybrid vehicles.

Japanese manufacturers have been producing luxury cars since the 1950s, including the Toyota Crown (1955–present), Prince/Nissan Gloria (1959–2004), Nissan Cedric (1960–2015), Mitsubishi Debonair (1964–1998), Nissan President (1965–2010), Toyota Century (1967–present), Mazda Luce/929 (1969–1991), and Honda Legend (1985–2021).

Since the 1980s, overseas sales of Japanese luxury cars have increased, challenging traditional European luxury brands.

Several East Asian manufacturers have created sub-brands for the marketing of luxury cars. The first of these was the 1986 launch of Acura (a Honda sub-brand), followed by Lexus (Toyota) in 1989, Infiniti (Nissan) in 1989, and Genesis (Hyundai) in 2015.

===2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession===
The time of the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession was the first time since the Great Depression that the luxury car market suffered considerably, something not seen in previous economic downturns. Many such customers saw their net worth decline during this time. For example, some of the steepest drop-offs came at the high end, including the BMW 7 Series and Rolls-Royce Phantom, and in 2010 Mercedes-Benz dropped the price of the W212 E-Class. The unusually sharp decline in luxury car sales has led observers to believe that there is a fundamental shift and reshaping of the luxury automotive market, with one industry official suggesting that the marques no longer command the premiums that they used to and another saying that conspicuous consumption was no longer attractive in poor economic conditions. Additionally, mainstream brands have been able to offer amenities and devices such as leather, wood, and anti-lock brakes, previously found only on luxury cars, as the costs decline.

However, luxury vehicle sales remained relatively high compared to their non-luxury counterparts. This was aided by growing interest in luxury vehicles from emerging markets such as China and Russia.

Sales in the entry-level luxury segment remained strong throughout the GFC, due to prices being lowered to compete with well-equipped non-luxury cars. For example, in Canada, several luxury manufacturers set sales records in August 2009, due mostly to discounted pricing on entry-level luxury vehicles.

== Brands ==


Some auto manufacturers market their luxury models using the same marque as the rest of their line. Others have created a separate marque (e.g. Lexus, launched by Toyota in 1989) or purchased one (e.g. Bentley, by Volkswagen in 1998).

Occasionally, a luxury car is initially sold under a mainstream marque and is later rebranded under a specific luxury marque (for example, the Hyundai&#x27;s Genesis to Genesis G80 as well as the Citroën DS to DS 5).

For mass-produced luxury cars, sharing of platforms or components with other models is common, as per modern automotive industry practice.

== Market categories ==

=== Compact executive / compact luxury ===
A compact executive car or a compact luxury car is a premium car larger than a premium compact and smaller than an executive car. In European classification, compact executive cars are part of the D-segment. In North American terms, close equivalents are &quot;compact premium car&quot;, &quot;compact luxury car&quot;, &quot;entry-level luxury car&quot; and &quot;near-luxury car&quot;. Compact executive cars are usually based on the platform of a mid-size car (also known as large family car or D-segment), while some models may be based on a compact car (also known as small family car or C-segment).

=== Executive / mid-size luxury ===
Executive car is a British term for an automobile larger than a large family car. In official use, the term is adopted by Euro NCAP, a European organization founded to test for car safety. It is a passenger car classification defined by the European Commission.

=== Luxury saloon / full-size luxury sedan ===
The next category of luxury cars is known in Great Britain as a &quot;luxury saloon&quot; or &quot;luxury limousine,&quot; and is known in the United States as a full-size luxury sedan, large luxury sedan, or flagship sedan. It is the equivalent of the European F-segment and the German Oberklasse segment.

Many of these luxury saloons are the flagship for the marque and include the newest automotive technology. Several models are available in long-wheelbase versions, which provide additional rear legroom and may have a higher level of standard features.

Examples of luxury saloons / full-size luxury sedans include the BMW 7 Series, Jaguar XJ, Cadillac CT6, Genesis G90, Audi A8, Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Lexus LS,Hongqi H9, Porsche Panamera and Maserati Quattroporte.


=== Ultra-luxury ===
Luxury cars costing over (as of 2007) can be considered as &quot;ultra-luxury cars&quot;. Examples include the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Maybach 57 and 62, Hongqi L5, Bentley Mulsanne, Cadillac Celestiq, Toyota Century, and Aurus Senat. High-end sports cars which are targeted towards performance rather than luxury are not usually classified as ultra-luxury cars, even when their cost is greater than . The history of a brand and the exclusivity of a particular model can result in price premiums compared to luxury cars with similar features from less prestigious manufacturers. Ultra-luxury cars are usually selected as the official state car.

===Grand tourer===
Grand tourers are essentially high-performance luxury vehicles. These vehicles are generally two-door coupes and are made for long-distance driving, combined with the luxury of an executive car or full-size luxury car.
===Luxury SUV / crossover===
Long before the luxury SUV segment was defined and became popular, the 1966 Jeep Super Wagoneer was marketed at the time as a fully-equipped station wagon. It was the first off-road SUV to offer a V8 engine and automatic transmission along with luxury car trim and equipment. Standard features included bucket seating, a center console, air conditioning, a seven-position tilt steering wheel, a vinyl roof, and gold-colored trim panels on the body sides and tailgate. By the late 1970s, optional equipment included an electric sunroof. The 1978 Jeep Wagoneer Limited was the spiritual successor to the Super Wagoneer and was the first four-wheel drive car to use leather upholstery.

The Range Rover was released in 1970 as a two-door vehicle for off-road durability with few &quot;creature comforts.&quot; A four-door version was added in 1981, and the model was pushed upmarket in 1983 by introducing an automatic transmission (Chrysler&#x27;s A727 TorqueFlite) as an option. The Range Rover had a long-travel coil-spring suspension and an aluminium V8 engine.

In the mid-1990s, the SUV market expanded with new entrants. By the mid-1990s, the entry-level Ford Explorer and upscale Jeep Grand Cherokee were the market leaders for SUVs. The fastest-growing sector of this market was for the so-called luxury SUVs, which included the Jeep Grand Cherokee ... the Grand Cherokee&#x27;s allure: &quot;This vehicle is proof you can have a true off-road vehicle without giving up luxuries and amenities&quot; with the Jeep providing a crucial new intangible factor for buyers—image.

The SUV models generated higher profit margins than passenger cars, and car manufacturers began introducing new luxury SUVs during the late 1990s. SUVs such as the 1995 Lexus LX, 1997 Mercedes-Benz M-Class, and 1998 Lincoln Navigator were the first SUVs produced by these luxury car brands. Some of these early luxury SUV models used unibody construction, becoming part of the trend moving away from the body-on-frame construction traditionally used by off-road vehicles.

During the mid-2000s, SUVs from luxury car brands grew by almost 40% in the United States to more than 430,000 vehicles (excluding SUV-only brands like Hummer and Land Rover), at a time when luxury car sales suffered a 1% decline, and non-luxury SUV sales were flat. By 2004, 30% of major luxury brands&#x27; U.S. sales were SUVs. Crossover SUVs became increasingly popular in the mid-2000s, and manufacturers also began to produce luxury versions of crossovers. The Lexus RX was the earliest luxury crossover on the market, and it has since been the best-selling luxury vehicle in the US. Some luxury crossovers are built on a platform shared with sedans or hatchbacks. For example, the Infiniti FX is based upon the same platform as the Infiniti G35 sedans and coupes. While early luxury crossovers released in the late 1990s have resembled traditional boxy SUVs, later crossovers, such as the Infiniti FX and BMW X6, have been designed with a sporting appearance.

Despite the increased popularity of crossover models, traditional luxury SUVs remain in production. Examples include the Lexus LX, Infiniti QX80, and Lincoln Navigator.

Research data from the mid-2000s suggested that luxury SUV buyers did not consider traditional luxury cars (e.g. sedans and coupes), therefore the SUV is becoming the key to bringing new customers into luxury dealerships.
Luxury car companies have increasingly introduced SUV or crossover models in the 2010s. For example, Rolls-Royce Cullinan, Bentley Bentayga, Aston Martin DBX, Maserati Levante, Lamborghini Urus, and Ferrari Purosangue. Some brands, such as Lincoln, have even moved to an all SUV and/or crossover lineup.

=== Luxury MPV ===
Manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Lexus, Buick, Hongqi, Zeekr and Volvo have marketed upscale luxury MPVs as luxury vehicles, mainly marketed for Asian markets.
Luxury MPVs generally have 3-rows of six or seven seats; however, range-topping flagship models may also offer a 2-rows option with four seats, which typically have more features than their cheaper counterparts. By the early 2020s, manufacturers have found additional strategies to improve technologies, such as new materials, new systems, and improving exteriors.

Examples of luxury MPV models include Mercedes-Benz V-Class, Lexus LM, Buick GL8, Hongqi HQ9, Toyota Alphard, Volvo EM90 and the Zeekr 009.

<text>The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the principal in-house research agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). ARS is one of four agencies in USDA&#x27;s Research, Education and Economics mission area. ARS is charged with extending the nation&#x27;s scientific knowledge and solving agricultural problems through its four national program areas: nutrition, food safety and quality; animal production and protection; natural resources and sustainable agricultural systems; and crop production and protection. ARS research focuses on solving problems affecting Americans every day. The ARS Headquarters is located in the Jamie L. Whitten Building on Independence Avenue in Washington, D.C., and the headquarters staff is located at the George Washington Carver Center (GWCC) in Beltsville, Maryland. For 2018, its budget was $1.2 billion. For 2023, the budget grew to $1.9 billion.

== Mission ==
ARS conducts scientific research for the American public. Their main focus is on research to develop solutions to agricultural problems and provide information access and dissemination to:
* ensure high quality, safe food and other agricultural products,
* assess the nutritional needs of Americans,
* sustain a competitive agricultural economy.
* enhance the natural resource base and the environment, and
* provide economic opportunities to rural citizens, communities, and society as a whole.

ARS research complements the work of state colleges and universities, agricultural experiment stations, other federal and state agencies, and the private sector. ARS research may often focus on regional issues that have national implications, and where there is a clear federal role. ARS also provides information on its research results to USDA action and regulatory agencies and to several other federal regulatory agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

ARS disseminates much of its research results through scientific journals, technical publications, &quot;Agricultural Research&quot; magazine, and other forums. Information is also distributed through ARS&#x27;s National Agricultural Library (NAL). ARS has more than 150 librarians and other information specialists who work at two NAL locations—the Abraham Lincoln Building in Beltsville, Maryland; and the DC Reference Center in Washington, D.C. NAL provides reference and information services, document delivery, interlibrary loan and interlibrary borrowing services to a variety of audiences.

== History ==

Prior to the inception of ARS, agricultural research was first conducted under the umbrella of the Agricultural Department in the U.S. Patent Office in 1839. It was created to collect statistics, distribute seeds and compile and distribute pertinent information. In 1862 the USDA was created and agricultural research was moved to its department. That same year, the department issued its first research bulletin on the sugar content of grape varietals and their suitability for wine. Six years later the USDA would begin its first research on animal diseases, specifically hog cholera, which was causing devastating losses at the time. In the early 1900s the USDA began analyzing food composition and the first studies of nutrition and the effects of cooking and processing foods were conducted. Finally, in 1953 the Agricultural Research Service was created to be the USDA&#x27;s primary scientific research agency.

== Research centers ==

ARS supports more than 2,000 scientists and post docs working on approximately 690 research projects within 15 National Programs at more than 90 research locations. The ARS is divided into 5 geographic areas: Midwest Area, Northeast Area, Pacific West Area, Plains Area, and Southeast Area. ARS has five major regional research centers:
* Western Regional Research Center in Albany, California
* Center for Agricultural Resources Research in Fort Collins, Colorado
* Southern Regional Research Center in New Orleans, Louisiana
* National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research in Peoria, Illinois
* Eastern Regional Research Center in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania

The research centers focus on innovation in agricultural practices, pest control, health, and nutrition among other things. Work at these facilities has given life to numerous products, processes, and technologies.

ARS&#x27; Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) in Beltsville, Maryland, is the world&#x27;s largest agricultural research complex. Other D.C. area locations include the United States National Agricultural Library and the United States National Arboretum.

ARS also has six major human nutrition research centers that focus on solving a wide spectrum of human nutrition questions by providing authoritative, peer-reviewed, science-based evidence. The centers are located in Arkansas, Maryland, Texas, North Dakota, Massachusetts (the Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging), and California. ARS scientists at these centers study the role of food and dietary components in human health from conception to advanced age.

The ARS also offers the Culture Collection, which is the largest public collection of microorganisms in the world, containing approximately 93,000 strains of bacteria and fungi. The ARS Culture Collection is housed at the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research (NCAUR). There is also a collection of entomopathogenic fungi, called ARSEF, at the Robert W. Holley Center for Agriculture and Health in Ithaca, New York. The ARS operates the U.S. Horticultural Research Laboratory in Fort Pierce, Florida, and the U.S. National Poultry Research Center in Athens, Georgia. Other notable ARS facilities include Northern Great Basin Experimental Range in Oregon, and formerly the Plum Island Animal Disease Center off Long Island.

Several ARS research units focus on pests, diseases, and management practices of horticultural crops. The is located on the campus of the University of Minnesota in Saint Paul. It primarily hosts research into rusts and &quot;Fusaria&quot; of cereals. The San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Sciences Center in Parlier, California conducts research on specialty crops including grapes, citrus, almonds, alfalfa, peaches, pomegranates, and many others. Several research locations throughout the US also house germplasm collections of plant species important for agricultural and industrial uses as part of the National Genetic Resources Program.

== Research impacts ==
From the very beginning the Department of Agriculture and in turn the Agricultural Research Service has been focused on improving not only the farming industry but also the quality of food and the health of Americans. In 1985, technology to produce lactose-free milk, yogurt, and ice cream was developed through the Agricultural Research Service. The grape breeding program, currently located in Parlier, CA which began in 1923, developed seedless grapes and continues to release new grapevine varieties with improved traits. The ARS Citrus and Subtropical Products Laboratory in Winter Haven, Florida, actively works to improve the taste of orange juice concentrate.

The Agricultural Research Service had a &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; (&quot;T. gondii&quot;) research program, which experimented on cats infected with the parasite, from 1982 until 2018. The prevalence of &quot;T. gondii&quot; parasite has been reduced by 50% in the U.S. which the ARS claims is a result of their research. The USDA has since discontinued the use of cats in their research amid acute accusations of animal abuse, and a lack of meaningful contribution to the field in recent years (only three of thirteen papers published about &quot;T. gondii&quot; by the ARS were published after the year 2000).

More recently, the ARS has focused research on genetics and plant and animal DNA. Their research has developed pest-resistant corn, faster growing plants and fish, and a focus on plant and animal genome research and mapping. Outside of scientific research, the ARS has worked to release databases on food components in order to assist consumers with making informed decisions about food choices.

<doc id="251899" wikidata="Q305481" url="?curid=251899" title="Alanine transaminase">
<text>Alanine transaminase (ALT), also known as alanine aminotransferase (ALT or ALAT), formerly serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) or serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), is a transaminase enzyme () that was first characterized in the mid-1950s by Arthur Karmen and colleagues. ALT is found in plasma and in various body tissues but is most common in the liver. It catalyzes the two parts of the alanine cycle. Serum ALT level, serum AST (aspartate transaminase) level, and their ratio (AST/ALT ratio) are routinely measured clinically as biomarkers for liver health.

The half-life of ALT in the circulation approximates 47 hours. Aminotransferase is cleared by sinusoidal cells in the liver.

== Function ==
ALT catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from -alanine to α-ketoglutarate, the products of this reversible transamination reaction being pyruvate and -glutamate.

:-alanine + α-ketoglutarate ⇌ pyruvate + -glutamate
ALT (and all aminotransferases) require the coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate, which is converted into pyridoxamine in the first phase of the reaction, when an amino acid is converted into a keto acid.
==Clinical significance==
ALT is commonly measured clinically as part of liver function tests and is a component of the AST/ALT ratio. When used in diagnostics, it is almost always measured in international units/liter (IU/L) or μkat. While sources vary on specific reference range values for patients, 0-40 IU/L is the standard reference range for experimental studies.

===Elevated levels===
Test results should always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that produced the result. However typical reference intervals for ALT are:
Significantly elevated levels of ALT (SGPT) often suggest the existence of other medical problems such as viral hepatitis, diabetes, congestive heart failure, liver damage, bile duct problems, infectious mononucleosis, or myopathy, so ALT is commonly used as a way of screening for liver problems. Elevated ALT may also be caused by dietary choline deficiency. However, elevated levels of ALT do not automatically mean that medical problems exist. Fluctuation of ALT levels is normal over the course of the day, and they can also increase in response to strenuous physical exercise.

When elevated ALT levels are found in the blood, the possible underlying causes can be further narrowed down by measuring other enzymes. For example, elevated ALT levels due to hepatocyte damage can be distinguished from bile duct problems by measuring alkaline phosphatase. Also, myopathy-related elevations in ALT should be suspected when the aspartate transaminase (AST) is greater than ALT; the possibility of muscle disease causing elevations in liver tests can be further explored by measuring muscle enzymes, including creatine kinase. Many drugs may elevate ALT levels, including zileuton, omega−3-acid ethyl esters (Lovaza), anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, cholesterol medications, some antipsychotics such as risperidone, and anticonvulsants. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) may also elevate ALT levels.

For years, the American Red Cross used ALT testing as part of the battery of tests to ensure the safety of its blood supply by deferring donors with elevated ALT levels. The intent was to identify donors potentially infected with hepatitis C because no specific test for that disease was available at the time. Prior to July 1992, widespread blood donation testing in the US for hepatitis C was not carried out by major blood banks. With the introduction of second-generation ELISA antibody tests for hepatitis C, the Red Cross changed the ALT policy. , donors previously disqualified for elevated ALT levels and no other reason may be reinstated as donors when they contact the donor-counseling department of their regional Red Cross organization.

In 2000, the American Association for Clinical Chemistry determined that the appropriate terminology for AST and ALT are aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. The term transaminase is outdated and no longer used in liver disease.

=== Low ALT ===
Low plasma ALT can be a marker of low muscle mass and is associated with frailty, sarcopenia, disability, as well as increased mortality in the elderly population. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, low ALT is associated with a more active disease.

<doc id="251900" wikidata="Q1330377" url="?curid=251900" title="Burnside's lemma">
<text>Burnside&#x27;s lemma, sometimes also called Burnside&#x27;s counting theorem, the Cauchy–Frobenius lemma, or the orbit-counting theorem, is a result in group theory that is often useful in taking account of symmetry when counting mathematical objects. It was discovered by Augustin Louis Cauchy and Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, and became well-known after William Burnside quoted it. The result enumerates orbits of a symmetry group acting on some objects: that is, it counts distinct objects, considering objects symmetric to each other as the same; or counting distinct objects up to a symmetry equivalence relation; or counting only objects in canonical form. For example, in describing possible organic compounds of certain type, one considers them up to spatial rotation symmetry: different rotated drawings of a given molecule are chemically identical. (However a mirror reflection might give a different compound.)

Formally, let &quot;G&quot; be a finite group that acts on a set &quot;X&quot;. For each &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, let &quot;Xg&quot; denote the set of elements in &quot;X&quot; that are fixed by &quot;g&quot; (left invariant by &quot;g&quot;): that is, &quot;Xg&quot; = { &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; | &quot;g&quot;.&quot;x&quot; = &quot;x&quot; }. Burnside&#x27;s lemma asserts the following formula for the number of orbits, denoted |&quot;X&quot;/&quot;G&quot;|:

formula_1

Thus the number of orbits (a natural number or +∞) is equal to the average number of points fixed by an element of &quot;G&quot;. For an infinite group &quot;G,&quot; there is still a bijection:

formula_2

== Examples of applications to enumeration ==
===Necklaces===
There are 8 possible bit strings of length 3, but tying together the string ends gives only four distinct 2-colored necklaces of length 3, given by the canonical forms 000, 001, 011, 111: the other strings 100 and 010 are equivalent to 001 by rotation, while 110 and 101 are equivalent to 011. That is, rotation equivalence splits the set &quot;X&quot; of strings into four orbits: formula_3The Burnside formula uses the number of rotations, which is 3 including the null rotation, and the number of bit strings left unchanged by each rotation. All 8 bit vectors are unchanged by the null rotation, and two (000 and 111) are unchanged by the other two rotations. Thus the number of orbits is:
formula_4

For length 4, there are 16 possible bit strings; 4 rotations; the null rotation leaves all 16 strings unchanged; the 1-rotation and 3-rotation each leave two strings unchanged (0000 and 1111); the 2-rotation leaves 4 bit strings unchanged (0000, 0101, 1010, 1111). The number of distinct necklaces is thus: formula_5, represented by the canonical forms 0000, 0001, 0011, 0101, 0111, 1111.

The general case of &quot;n&quot; bits and &quot;k&quot; colors is given by a necklace polynomial.

=== Colorings of a cube ===
Burnside&#x27;s lemma can compute the number of rotationally distinct colourings of the faces of a cube using three colours.

Let &quot;X&quot; be the set of 36 possible face color combinations that can be applied to a fixed cube, and let the rotation group &quot;G&quot; of the cube act on &quot;X&quot; by moving the colored faces: two colorings in &quot;X&quot; belong to the same orbit precisely when one is a rotation of the other. Rotationally distinct colorings correspond to group orbits, and can be found by counting the sizes of the fixed sets for the 24 elements of &quot;G&quot;, the colorings left unchanged by each rotation:
* the identity element fixes all 36 colorings
* six 90-degree face rotations each fix 33 colorings
* three 180-degree face rotations each fix 34 colorings
* eight 120-degree vertex rotations each fix 32 colorings
* six 180-degree edge rotations each fix 33 colorings.

A detailed examination may be found
here.

The average fixed-set size is thus:

: formula_6

There are 57 rotationally distinct colourings of the faces of a cube in three colours. In general, the number of rotationally distinct colorings of the faces of a cube in &quot;n&quot; colors is:

: formula_7

== Proof ==

In the proof of Burnside&#x27;s lemma, the first step is to re-express the sum over the group elements &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot; as an equivalent sum over the set of elements &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;:

:formula_8

Here &quot;Xg&quot; = {&quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; | &quot;g.x&quot; = &quot;x&quot;} is the set of points of &quot;X&quot; fixed by &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;, whereas &quot;Gx&quot; = {&quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot; | &quot;g.x&quot; = &quot;x&quot;} is the stabilizer subgroup of G, symmetries that fix the point &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;.)

The orbit-stabilizer theorem says that for each &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; there is a natural bijection between the orbit &quot;G·x&quot; = {&quot;g·x&quot; | &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;}  and the set of left cosets &quot;G/Gx&quot;. Lagrange&#x27;s theorem implies:

:formula_9

The sum may therefore be rewritten as:

:formula_10

Writing &quot;X&quot; as the disjoint union of its orbits in &quot;X/G&quot;:

:formula_11

Putting everything together gives the desired result:

:formula_12

This is similar to the proof of the conjugacy class equation, which considers the conjugation action of &quot;G&quot; on itself: &quot;X&quot; = &quot;G&quot; and &quot;g&quot;.&quot;x&quot; = &quot;gxg&quot;−1, so that the stabilizer of &quot;x&quot; is centralizer&quot;: Gx = ZG&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

==Enumeration vs. generation==
Burnside&#x27;s lemma counts distinct objects, but it does not construct them. In general, combinatorial generation with isomorph rejection considers the symmetries of &quot;g&quot;, on objects &quot;x&quot;. But instead of checking that &quot;g.x = x&quot;, it checks that &quot;g.x&quot; has not already been generated. One way to accomplish this is by checking that &quot;g.x&quot; is not lexicographically less than &quot;x&quot;, using the lexicographically least member of each equivalence class as the canonical form of the class. Counting the objects generated with such a technique can verify that Burnside&#x27;s lemma was correctly applied.

==History: the lemma that is not Burnside&#x27;s==
William Burnside stated and proved this lemma in his 1897 book on finite groups, attributing it to . But even prior to Frobenius, the formula was known to Cauchy in 1845. Consequently, this lemma is sometimes referred to as the lemma that is not Burnside&#x27;s. Misnaming scientific discoveries is referred to as Stigler&#x27;s law of eponymy.

<doc id="251906" wikidata="Q3519769" url="?curid=251906" title="The American Prospect">
<text>The American Prospect is a daily online and bimonthly print American political and public policy magazine dedicated to American modern liberalism and progressivism. Based in Washington, D.C., &quot;The American Prospect&quot; says it &quot;is devoted to promoting informed discussion on public policy from a progressive perspective.&quot; Its motto is &quot;Ideas, Politics, and Power&quot;.

==History==
The magazine, initially called &quot;The Liberal Prospect&quot;, was founded in 1990 by Robert Kuttner, Robert Reich, and Paul Starr as a response to the perceived ascendancy of conservatism in the 1980s. Kuttner and Starr serve as co-editors. As of December 2024, David Dayen serves as executive editor and Mitch Grummon serves as publisher. Ganesh Sitaraman chairs the board of directors.

Other editors include Managing Editor Ryan Cooper, co-founder and co-editor Robert Kuttner, Editor-at-Large Harold Meyerson, co-founder and co-editor Paul Starr, Deputy Editor Gabrielle Gurley, associate editor Susanne Beiser, and investigations editor Maureen Tkacik.

Staff writers and contributors have included Gabriel Arana, Steve Erickson, Adele Stan, Paul Waldman, and EJ Dionne. Other notable contributors to &quot;The Prospect&quot; print and online magazine include author David Garrow and Harvard Law professor Randall Kennedy. Eric Alterman served as the main media criticism and history columnist from 2021 to 2023, when he was replaced by Rick Perlstein, who served through 2024.

&quot;The Prospect&quot; has several programs to focus on the development of the next generation of progressive writers and journalists. Its internship program counts among its alumni Bernie Sanders advisor Matt Duss. Former &quot;Prospect&quot; intern Shera Avi-Yonah was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship in 2021. Its writing fellowship program enables young writers to develop their skills under an intensive mentoring program that is widely regarded as one of the foremost springboards to fulfilling careers in journalism and the academy. Alumni include Ezra Klein, Matt Yglesias, Jamelle Bouie, Adam Serwer, Chris Mooney, Joshua Micah Marshall, Dana Goldstein, Nicholas Confessore, and Kate Sheppard.

In March 2010, &quot;The American Prospect&quot; entered into an affiliation with Demos, a public policy research and advocacy center based in New York City. The official affiliation ended in 2012. That year, the magazine nearly folded due to financial struggles, but raised enough money to stay afloat. In 2014, the magazine repurposed itself as a &quot;quarterly journal of ideas&quot;. Kit Rachlis announced he was leaving the editorship of the magazine, senior writer Monica Potts and editor Bob Moser were laid off, and several other editorial staffers left the publication.

In 2019, &quot;The Prospect&quot; celebrated its 30th anniversary. At the anniversary gala, Kuttner said, &quot;&quot;The Prospect&quot; has been all about connecting dots—between the structural corruptions of capitalism, the deep analysis of how that operates politically, the narrative story of how regular people experience it, the related corruption of our democracy, and the movement politics of taking America back.&quot;

Executive editor David Dayen introduced a new motto for &quot;The Prospect&quot;: &quot;Ideas, Politics, and Power&quot;. Dayen reported extensively on the coronavirus pandemic in his daily newsletters, Unsanitized and First 100, and pointed &quot;The Prospect&quot;″s coverage toward Washington insider knowledge, including series like Cabinet Watch, which broke news of several of Joe Biden&#x27;s high-profile Cabinet appointments.

In 2020, &quot;The Prospect&quot; introduced its flagship Day One Agenda series, outlining the ways in which then President-elect Biden could use executive power to implement progressive policy. Reporting from the series has been cited in &quot;Vox&quot;, &quot;Salon&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

As of 2020, &quot;The Prospect&quot; partners with news organizations including &quot;The Intercept&quot; and &quot;Dissent Magazine&quot;.

==Accolades, awards, and recognition==
In 2010, &quot;The American Prospect&quot; was the recipient of &quot;Utne Reader&quot; magazine&#x27;s Utne Independent Press Award for Political Coverage.
In 2017, then-&quot;Prospect&quot; columnist Adele M. Stan won the Hillman Prize for Opinion and Analysis Journalism. Her reporting on the American far right predicted Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency. The committee wrote of Stan&#x27;s work: &quot;Stan&#x27;s prescient 2016 portfolio stands as a chilling testimony to fearless commentary, and signals the changes we need in public life and in journalism to preserve civil liberties and pursue social justice.&quot;

In 2021, Dayen won the Hillman Prize in Magazine Journalism for his Unsanitized newsletter series.

Also in 2021, Deputy Editor Gabrielle Gurley won the Gene Burd Award for Excellence in Urban Journalism for her article &quot;Public Transportation in Crisis&quot;.

Managing Editor Jonathan Guyer won the 2021 Dateline Award for Investigative Journalism (Magazine), recognizing excellence in the category of Investigative Journalism, for his feature &quot;The Lucrative Afterlife of a Trump Official&quot;.

==Format==
Originally, &quot;The American Prospect&quot; published quarterly, then bimonthly. In 2000, thanks to a grant from the Schumann Center for Media and Democracy, it became biweekly. Financial and logistical difficulties ensued, and the magazine moved to a ten-issue-per-year format in spring 2003 and a bimonthly format in summer 2012. The online version of the magazine included a blog called TAPPED (derived from TAP, the acronym of &quot;The American Prospect&quot;). Facing financial issues, the magazine reduced its bi-monthly publication schedule to a quarterly publication schedule in 2014. Starting in 2020, the magazine returned to a bimonthly schedule.

&quot;The Prospect&quot; releases periodic special issues, including the Green New Deal (November 2019), Caregiving in Crisis (October 2020), and the Supply Chain Debacle (February 2022).

<doc id="251916" wikidata="Q595564" url="?curid=251916" title="Houston Chronicle">
<text>The Houston Chronicle is the largest daily newspaper in Houston, Texas, United States. it is the third-largest newspaper by Sunday circulation in the United States, behind only &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. With the 1995 buyout of its longtime rival the &quot;Houston Post&quot;, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; became Houston&#x27;s newspaper of record.

The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; is the largest daily newspaper owned and operated by the Hearst Corporation, a privately held multinational corporate media conglomerate with $10 billion in revenues. The paper employs nearly 2,000 people, including approximately 300 journalists, editors, and photographers. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; has bureaus in Washington, D.C., and Austin. The paper reports that its web site averages 125 million page views per month.

The publication serves as the &quot;newspaper of record&quot; of the Houston area. Previously headquartered in the Houston Chronicle Building at 801 Texas Avenue, Downtown Houston, the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; is now located at 4747 Southwest Freeway.

While Houston Chronicle staff formerly published on the ad-supported, non-subscriber site Chron.com, today Chron and Houston Chronicle have separate websites and newsrooms. Houstonchronicle.com, launched in 2012, is a subscriber-only site that contains everything found in the daily print edition.

==History==
From its inception, the practices and policies of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; were shaped by strong-willed personalities who were the publishers. The history of the newspaper can be best understood when divided into the eras of these individuals.

===1901–1926: Marcellus E. Foster era===
The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; was founded in 1901 by a former reporter for the now-defunct &quot;Houston Post&quot;, Marcellus E. Foster. Foster, who had been covering the Spindletop oil boom for the &quot;Post&quot;, invested in Spindletop and took $30 of the return on that investment—at the time equivalent to a week&#x27;s wages—and used it to fund the &quot;Chronicle&quot;.

The &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s first edition was published on October 14, 1901, and sold for two cents per copy, at a time when most papers sold for five cents each. At the end of its first month in operation, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; had a circulation of 4,378—roughly one tenth of the population of Houston at the time. Within the first year of operation, the paper purchased and consolidated the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.

In 1908, Foster asked Jesse H. Jones, a local businessman and prominent builder, to construct a new office and plant for the paper, &quot;and offered [a] half-interest in the newspaper as a down payment, with twenty years to pay the remainder. Jones agreed, and the resulting Chronicle Building was one of the finest in the South.&quot;

Under Foster, the paper&#x27;s circulation grew from about 7,000 in 1901 to 75,000 on weekdays and 85,000 on Sundays by 1926. Foster continued to write columns under the pen name &quot;Mefo&quot;, and drew much attention in the 1920s for his opposition to the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). He sold the rest of his interest to Jesse H. Jones on June 26, 1926, and promptly retired.

===Goodfellows===
In 1911, city editor George Kepple started Goodfellows. On Christmas Eve 1911, Kepple passed a hat among the &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s reporters to collect money to buy toys for a shoe-shine boy.

Goodfellows continues today through donations made by the newspaper and its readers. It has grown into a citywide program that provides needy children between the ages of two and ten with toys during the winter holidays. In 2003, Goodfellows distributed almost 250,000 toys to more than 100,000 needy children in the Greater Houston area.

===1926–1956: Jesse H. Jones era===
In 1926, Jesse H. Jones became the sole owner of the paper. He had approached Foster about selling, and Foster had answered, &quot;What will you give me?&quot; Jones described the buyout of Foster as follows:
In 1937, Jesse H. Jones transferred ownership of the paper to the newly established Houston Endowment Inc. Jones retained the title of publisher until his death in 1956.

According to the &quot;Handbook of Texas&quot; online, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; generally represented very conservative political views during the 1950s:
... the &quot;Chronicle&quot; generally represented the very conservative political interests of the Houston business establishment. As such, it eschewed controversial political topics, such as integration or the impacts of rapid economic growth on life in the city. It did not perform investigative journalism. This resulted in a stodgy newspaper that failed to capture the interests of newcomers to the city. By 1959, circulation of the rival &quot;Houston Post&quot; had pulled ahead of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;.

Jones, a lifelong Democrat who organized the Democratic National Convention to be in Houston in 1928, and who spent long years in public service first under the Wilson administration, helping to found the Red Cross during World War I, and later famously under the Roosevelt administration, described the paper&#x27;s mission in these terms:

I regard the publication of a newspaper as a distinct public trust, and one not to be treated lightly or abused for selfish purposes or to gratify selfish whims. A great daily newspaper can remain a power for good only so long as it is uninfluenced by unworthy motives, and unbought by the desire for gain. A newspaper which can be neither bought nor bullied is the greatest asset of a city or state. Naturally, a newspaper makes mistakes in judgment, as it does in type; but, so long as errors are honestly made, they are not serious when general results are considered.

The success or failure of a particular issue is of little consequence compared with the all-important principle of a fearless and honest newspaper. This I intend the &quot;Chronicle&quot; shall always be, a newspaper for all the people, democratic in fact and in principle, standing for the greatest good to the greatest number, championing and defending what it believes to be right, and condemning and opposing what it believes to be wrong.

Such have always been the policies of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; and to such it is now rededicated.&quot;

Under Jones&#x27; watch, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; bought KTRH, one of Houston&#x27;s oldest radio stations, in 1937. In 1954, Jones led a syndicate that signed on Houston&#x27;s third television station, KTRK-TV.

===1956–1965: John T. Jones era===
The board of Houston Endowment named John T. Jones, nephew of Jesse H. Jones, as editor of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. Houston Endowment president, J. Howard Creekmore, was named publisher. In 1961, John T. Jones hired William P. Steven as editor. Steven had previously been editor of the &quot;Tulsa Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Minneapolis Star Tribune&quot;, and credited with turning around the declining readership of both papers. One of his innovations was the creation of a regular help column called &quot;Watchem&quot;, where ordinary citizens could voice their complaints. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; later called this column a pioneer and prototype of the modern newspaper &quot;Action Line&quot;.

Steven&#x27;s progressive political philosophy soon created conflict with the very conservative views of the Houston Endowment board, especially when he editorially supported the election of Lyndon B. Johnson, the Democratic candidate for president. However, more than political philosophy was involved: Robert A. Caro revealed in his biography of Johnson that written assurance of this support from John T. Jones had been the price demanded by Johnson in January 1964 in return for approval of the merger of Houston&#x27;s National Bank of Commerce, in which Jones had a financial interest, with another Houston bank, the Texas National.

In 1964, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; purchased the assets of its evening newspaper competitor, the &quot;Houston Press&quot;, becoming the only evening newspaper in the city. By then, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; had a circulation of 254,000—the largest of any paper in Texas. The &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; credited the growth to the changes instigated by Steven.

In the summer of 1965, Jones decided to buy a local television station that was already owned by the Houston Endowment. He resigned from the Houston Endowment board to avoid a conflict of interest, though he remained as publisher of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. On September 2, 1965, Jones made a late-night visit to the Steven home, where he broke the news that the Endowment board had ordered him to dismiss Steven. Jones had to comply. On September 3, the paper published a story announcing that Everett Collier was now the new editor.

No mention was made of Steven or the Houston Endowment board. &quot;Houston Post&quot; staff wrote an article about the change, but top management killed it. Only two weekly papers in Houston mentioned it: &quot;Forward Times&quot; (which targeted the African-American community) and the &quot;Houston Tribune&quot; (an ultra-conservative paper). Both papers had rather small circulations and no influence among the city&#x27;s business community. The two major newspapers in Houston never mentioned Steven for many years thereafter.

===1965–1987: J. Howard Creekmore era===
John J. Jones left the &quot;Chronicle&quot; not long after Steven&#x27;s ouster. J. Howard Creekmore, president of the Houston Endowment, took John Jones&#x27; place at the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. Everett D. Collier replaced Steven as editor. Collier remained in this position until his retirement in 1979.

J. Howard Creekmore was born in Abilene, Texas, in 1905. His parents died while he was young, so he was raised by his stepmother. The family moved to Houston in 1920. Howard enrolled in Rice Institute, where he graduated with degrees in history and English. After graduation, he went to work for Jesse Jones as a bookkeeper. Jones took an interest in the young man&#x27;s career, and put him through law school. Creekmore passed the bar exam in 1932 and returned to work for Jones. He held several positions in the Jones business empire. In 1959, he was named to the board of Houston Endowment, and was promoted to president of the board in 1964.

By 1965, Creekmore had persuaded other directors of Houston Endowment to sell several business properties, including the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. Houston oilman John Mecom offered $85 million for the newspaper, its building, a 30 percent interest in Texas National Bank of Commerce, and the historic Rice Hotel. Early in 1966, Mecom encountered problems raising the additional cash to complete the transaction. He then began lining up potential buyers for the newspaper, which included non-Houstonians such as Sam Newhouse, Otis Chandler and the Scripps-Howard organization. Creekmore strongly believed that local persons should own the paper. He insisted that Mecom pay the $84 million debt immediately in cash. Mecom cancelled his purchase agreement.

In 1968, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; set a Texas newspaper circulation record.
In 1981, the business pages—which until then had been combined with sports—became its own section of the newspaper. Creekmore remained as publisher until Houston Endowment sold the paper to the Hearst Corporation.

===1987–present: Hearst Corporation era===
On May 1, 1987, the Hearst Corporation purchased the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; from Houston Endowment for $415 million.

Richard J. V. Johnson, who had joined the paper as a copy editor in 1956, and worked up to executive vice president in 1972, and president in 1973, remained as chairman and publisher until he retired on April 1, 2002. He was succeeded by Jack Sweeney.

In 1994, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; switched to being a morning-only paper. With the demise of the &quot;Houston Post&quot; on April 18 the next year, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; became Houston&#x27;s sole major daily newspaper.

On October 18, 2008, the paper endorsed Senator Barack Obama for President of the United States in the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election, the first Democrat to be endorsed by the newspaper since 1964, when it endorsed Texan Lyndon B. Johnson. It endorsed Mitt Romney in 2012, but endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Joe Biden in 2020.

Locally, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; endorsed Wendy Davis for governor in 2014, and Sylvester Turner for mayor in 2015. Additionally, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; initially endorsed Jeb Bush for the 2016 Republican primary, but did not endorse any other candidate after he dropped out.

===2018 source-fabrication scandal===
In September 2018, then-executive editor Nancy Barnes released a statement on the &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s website notifying readers for the first time that the paper&#x27;s Austin bureau chief, Mike Ward, had resigned and was the subject of an internal investigation after questions were raised by a staff member over fabricating sources. Barnes opted not to disclose the source-fabrication or Ward&#x27;s resignation to &quot;Chronicle&quot; readers and the general public until she was contacted by reporters at other outlets pursuing a story about the &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s scandal—one full week after Ward had resigned. By the time Barnes informed the public about what would turn into the biggest journalism scandal of 2018, it had already become one of the worst kept secrets in Austin among the capitol press corps that writes about Texas politicians. The scandal had also become popular fodder among staffers who work at the capital. Within 45 minutes of being contacted by a freelance reporter for the &quot;Texas Observer&quot;, Barnes hastily issued a press release announcing that one of her reporters bad been caught making up sources over the course of several years. Barnes never explained why the &quot;Chronicle&quot; decided against being transparent to it readers immediately, instead of waiting for word to leak to the extent that other news outlets started planning stories.

The sources being questioned in Ward&#x27;s reporting were the product of &quot;man-on-the-street&quot; interviews from a story dealing with rebuilding efforts following Hurricane Harvey. Barnes said &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; researchers had problems finding a number of sources quoted in Ward&#x27;s story, so the newspaper hired investigative journalist David Wood, a Pulitzer Prize winner.

On November 8, 2018, one day before Barnes left for a position as senior vice president of news at National Public Radio, the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; released some of Wood&#x27;s findings. The paper announced it was retracting a total of eight stories.

Barnes later went on to tell &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; that the widespread fabrication apparent in Ward&#x27;s articles was unprecedented, in her experience: &quot;I&#x27;ve been an editor a long time and I have never seen anything like this, period.&quot;. None of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s editors responsible for overseeing Ward&#x27;s stories—including then-managing editor Vernon Loeb—assumed any responsibility for the fact that one of their reporters had been cheating for years under their noses. In many instances over the course of years, Loeb worked directly with Ward and even rewrote his stories for final publication.

The &quot;Austin American Statesman&quot;, where Ward worked as a reporter for 25 years covering the state&#x27;s political class prior to joining the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; in 2014, also conducted an internal review of &quot;his final years&quot; of work at the paper.

A copy of the original story that led to the investigation has been removed from the &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s website. But Austin-based NPR affiliate KUT interviewed Ward for the radio in the days after the story ran and still has the story posted on its website, despite the fact that the sources used in Ward&#x27;s reporting are suspected of being fake.

==Headquarters==

===4747 Southwest Freeway===

On July 21, 2014, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; announced that its Downtown employees were moving to the 610 Loop campus, at the intersection of the 610 Loop and U.S. Route 59/I-69 (Southwest Freeway).

The facility, previously used as the &quot;Houston Post&quot; headquarters, will have a total of seven buildings with a total of over of space. The original building is a 1970s four-story &quot;New Brutalist&quot; building.

As of 2016, the building housed the &quot;Chronicle&quot; Production Department, as well as the offices of the Spanish newspaper &quot;La Voz de Houston&quot;.

===801 Texas Avenue===

The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; building in Downtown Houston was the headquarters of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;. The facility included a loading dock, office space, a press room, and production areas. It had ten stories above ground and three stories below ground. The printing presses used by the newspaper spanned three stories. The presses were two stories below ground and one above. In the Downtown facility, the presses there were decommissioned in the late 2000s. The newsroom within the facility had bullpen-style offices with a few private cubicles and offices on the edges. The facility was connected to the downtown Houston tunnel system. Turner wrote that &quot;in recent decades,&quot; 801 Texas Avenue &quot;offered viewers an architectural visage of unadorned boxiness... An accretion of five buildings made into one, it featured a maze of corridors, cul-de-sacs and steps that seemed to spring on strollers at the most unexpected times.&quot;

The facility, which was 106 years old in 2016, was originally four separate structures, which were joined to make one building. Jesse H. Jones erected the first &quot;Chronicle&quot; building, a long, narrow structure clad in granite, on the corner of Travis Street and Texas Avenue in 1910. The second building, the Majestic Theater, was built west of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; building. The second building built by Jones opened in 1910. In 1918, the third Jones building, Milam Building, opened west of the theater. An annex was built on the north side of the main building in 1938 and gained a fifth floor in the 1960s. The fifth building was a production plant, built north of the original four buildings. They were joined in a major renovation and modernization project, which was completed in the late 1960s.

On April 25, 2017, it was imploded and reduced to rubble. The site is now occupied by the Texas Tower.

==Other publications==
In April 2004 the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; began carrying a Spanish-language supplement, the entertainment magazine &quot;La Vibra&quot;. &quot;La Vibra&quot; caters to speakers of Spanish and bilingual English-Spanish speakers, and is mainly distributed in Hispanic neighborhoods. In December 2004 the &quot;Chronicle&quot; acquired the Spanish-language newspaper &quot;La Voz de Houston&quot;.

==Criticism==
===Robert Jensen on the September 11 attacks===
In the weeks following the September 11 attacks, the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; published a series of opinion articles by University of Texas journalism professor Robert Jensen that asserted the United States was &quot;just as guilty&quot; as the hijackers in committing acts of violence and compared that attack with the history of U.S. attacks on civilians in other countries. The opinion piece resulted in hundreds of angry letters to the editor and reportedly over 4,000 angry responses to Jensen.

Among them were claims of insensitivity against the newspaper and of giving an unduly large audience to a position characterized as being extremist. University of Texas president Larry Faulkner issued a response denouncing Jensen&#x27;s as &quot;a fountain of undiluted foolishness on issues of public policy&quot;, noting &quot;[h]e is not speaking in the University&#x27;s name and may not speak in its name.&quot;

===Light rail controversy===

The document was online for only an hour, but long enough to be viewed by some readers. Soon after, the &quot;Houston Review&quot;, a conservative newspaper published by students at the University of Houston, printed the memo&#x27;s full text and an accompanying commentary that criticized the paper.

Harris County District Attorney Rosenthal later dismissed the &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s complaint, finding it without merit on the grounds that the statute did not apply. Rosenthal&#x27;s involvement in the probe itself came under fire by the &quot;Houston Press&quot;, which in editorials questioned whether Rosenthal was too close to TTM: from 2000 to 2004, Rosenthal accepted some $30,000 in donations from known TTM supporters.

===Sandoval family interview===
In early 2004, &quot;Chronicle&quot; reporter Lucas Wall interviewed the family of Leroy Sandoval, a Marine from Houston who was killed in Iraq. After the article appeared, Sandoval&#x27;s stepfather and sister called into Houston talk radio station KSEV and said that a sentence alleging &quot;President Bush&#x27;s failure to find weapons of mass destruction&quot; in Iraq misrepresented their views on the war and President George W. Bush, that Wall had pressured them for a quotation that criticized Bush, and that the line alleging Bush&#x27;s &quot;failure&quot; was included against the wishes of the family.

A dispute ensued between KSEV radio show host/owner Dan Patrick and an assistant managing editor at the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. The incident prompted Patrick to join the call for a boycott of the paper. The story was also picked up by the local Houston television stations and, a week later, the O&#x27;Reilly Factor. Eventually, &quot;Chronicle&quot; publisher Jack Sweeney contacted the Sandoval family to apologize.

===Purchase of &quot;Houston Post&quot; assets===
Internal memos obtained via FOIA from the Justice Department antitrust attorneys who investigated the closing of the &quot;Houston Post&quot; said the &quot;Chronicle&#x27;s&quot; parent organization struck a deal to buy the &quot;Post&quot; six months before it closed. The memos, first obtained by the alternative paper the &quot;Houston Press&quot;, say the &quot;Chronicle&#x27;s&quot; conglomerate and the &quot;Post&quot; &quot;reached an agreement in October, 1994, for the sale of Houston Post Co.&#x27;s assets for approximately $120 million.&quot;

===Tom DeLay poll===
In January 2006 the &quot;Chronicle&quot; hired Richard Murray of the University of Houston to conduct an election survey in the district of U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay, in light of his 2005 indictment by District Attorney Ronnie Earle for alleged campaign money violations. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; said that its poll showed &quot;severely eroded support for U.S. Rep Tom DeLay in his district, most notably among Republicans who have voted for him before.&quot;

Former Texas Secretary of State Jack Rains contacted the &quot;Chronicle&#x27;s&quot; James Howard Gibbons, alleging that the poll appeared to incorrectly count non-Republican Primary voters in its sample. Rains also asserted that Murray had a conflict of interest in the poll, as Murray&#x27;s son Keir was a political consultant working for Nick Lampson, DeLay&#x27;s Democratic challenger in 2006.

==Other controversies==
The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; has faced significant challenges with its journalistic integrity. In 2020, the paper faced allegations of publishing articles without properly adhering to its own ethics policy, especially in regards to contacting subjects before publishing negative portrayals. There were also claims suggesting retaliation against individuals for not purchasing advertisements. This trust was further eroded in 2018 when the &quot;Chronicle&quot; retracted eight articles after it was revealed they were significantly based on sources whose existence could not be verified. An extensive review of the articles penned by Austin bureau chief Mike Ward showed that out of 275 individuals he quoted in various stories, 44% could not be located or confirmed. Beyond the retractions, an additional 64 of Ward&#x27;s stories required corrections due to the inclusion of unverified sources, further tainting the paper&#x27;s credibility. This was a result of an examination of 744 stories written by Ward since January 2014, with independent investigators unable to verify the existence of nearly half of the individuals he had quoted.

==Availability of &quot;Houston Post&quot; articles==
Some &quot;Houston Post&quot; articles had been made available in the archives of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; website, but by 2005 they were removed. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; online editor Mike Read said that the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; decided to remove &quot;Houston Post&quot; articles from the website after the 2001 United States Supreme Court &quot;New York Times Co. v. Tasini&quot; decision; the newspaper originally planned to filter articles not allowed by the decision and to post articles that were not prohibited by the decision. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; decided not to post or re-post any more &quot;Houston Post&quot; articles because of difficulties in complying with the &quot;New York Times Co. v. Tasini&quot; decision with the resources that were available to the newspaper.

People interested in reading &quot;Houston Post&quot; articles may view them on microfilm. The Houston Public Library has the newspaper on microfilm from 1880 to 1995 and the &quot;Houston Post&quot; Index from 1976 to 1994. The 1880–1900 microfilm is in the Texas and Local History Department of the Julia Ideson Building, while 1900–1995 is in the Jesse H. Jones Building, the main building of the Central Library. In addition, the M.D. Anderson Library at the University of Houston has the &quot;Houston Post&quot; available on microfilm from 1880 to 1995, and the &quot;Houston Post&quot; Index from 1976 to 1979 and from 1987 to 1994.

<doc id="251917" wikidata="Q290107" url="?curid=251917" title="Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough">
<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Richard John Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough (13 November 1871 – 30 June 1934), styled Earl of Sunderland until 1883 and Marquess of Blandford between 1883 and 1892, was a British soldier and Conservative politician, and a close friend of his first cousin Winston Churchill. He was often known as &quot;Sunny&quot; Marlborough after his courtesy title of Earl of Sunderland.

==Early life and education==
Born at Simla, British India, Marlborough was the only son of the then Marquess of Blandford (who succeeded as The 8th Duke of Marlborough in July 1883) and Lady Albertha Frances Anne, daughter of The 1st Duke of Abercorn. He was a nephew of Lord Randolph Churchill and a first cousin of Sir Winston Churchill, with whom he had a close and lifelong friendship. He was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Political career==

Marlborough entered the House of Lords on the early death of his father in 1892, and made his maiden speech in August 1895. In 1899, he was appointed Paymaster General by Lord Salisbury, a post he held until 1902. He was then Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies under Arthur Balfour between 1903 and 1905. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1899.

He again held political office during the First World War, when he was Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries between 1917 and 1918 in David Lloyd George&#x27;s coalition government. He made his last speech in the House of Lords in December 1931.

Shortly before the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, Marlborough was invested as a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter (KG) at Buckingham Palace on 30 May 1902. He subsequently served as Lord High Steward at the coronation the following August (the coronation had originally been scheduled for June). He went to India to attend the January 1903 Delhi Durbar as a guest of the Viceroy, Lord Curzon.

The Duke of Marlborough was Mayor of Woodstock between 1907 and 1909, and Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire from 1915 until his death.

He was President of the National Fire Brigades Union and founded the British Cotton Growers Association. He was also, after his father, a prominent member of the Ancient Order of Druids, and patron of the prestigious AOD Albion Lodge based at Oxford. On 10 August 1908, in the park of Blenheim Palace, he welcomed the ceremony of initiation of his cousin, Winston Churchill, as a Druid.

==Military career==

Marlborough was appointed a lieutenant in the Queen&#x27;s Own Oxfordshire Hussars in 1897. After the outbreak of the Second Boer War, he was in January 1900 seconded for service as a Staff Captain in the Imperial Yeomanry serving in South Africa, and received the temporary rank of captain. He arrived in Cape Town in March 1900, and left for Naauwpoort in Northern Cape Colony with the Oxford company of the Imperial Yeomanry.

He was subsequently appointed Assistant Military Secretary to Lord Roberts, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in South Africa, and was aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Ian Hamilton.

He was mentioned in despatches and promoted to major on 7 December 1901. After the formation of the Territorial Army he was appointed honorary colonel of the 3rd (Special Reserve) Battalion of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry in 1908.

He was promoted Lieutenant-Colonel of his yeomanry regiment in 1910, serving until 1914. He was awarded the Territorial Decoration (TD) in 1913. He rejoined during the First World War, when he served as a lieutenant-colonel on the General Staff in France. During a visit at the Western Front to his cousin Winston who was then serving in the trenches, both narrowly missed being killed when a piece of shrapnel (now displayed at Blenheim Palace) fell between them. He was later Honorary Colonel and commandant of the Oxfordshire Volunteer Regiment of the Volunteer Training Corps from 1918 to 1920.

==Marriages and issue==
Marlborough was married twice. His first wife was the American railroad heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt, whom he married at Saint Thomas Church in New York City on 6 November 1895. The marriage was a mercenary one. Inheriting his near-bankrupt dukedom in 1892, he was forced to find a quick and drastic solution to the financial problems of his family. Prevented by the strict social dictates of late 19th-century society from earning money, he was left with one solution; to marry money.

The marriage was celebrated following lengthy negotiations with his bride&#x27;s divorced parents: her mother, Alva Vanderbilt, was desperate to see her daughter a duchess, and the bride&#x27;s father, William Vanderbilt, paid for the privilege. The final price was $2,500,000 (worth about $77,000,000 in 2021) in 50,000 shares of the capital stock of the Beech Creek Railway Company with a minimum 4% dividend guaranteed by the New York Central Railroad Company. The couple were each given a further annual income of $100,000 for life. The bride later claimed she had been locked in her room until she agreed to the marriage. The contract was actually signed in the vestry of St. Thomas Episcopal Church, immediately after the wedding vows had been made. While they honeymooned in Europe, Marlborough told Consuelo that he actually loved another woman but had married her to &quot;save Blenheim&quot;.

They had two sons, John Spencer-Churchill, Marquess of Blandford, eventually the 10th Duke of Marlborough, and Lord Ivor Spencer-Churchill. Their mother famously referred to them as &quot;the heir and the spare&quot;.

The Vanderbilt dowry was used to restore Blenheim Palace and replenish its furnishings and library, for many of the original contents had been sold over the course of the 19th century. Many of the jewels worn by subsequent Duchesses of Marlborough also date from this period. The 9th Duke employed noted landscape gardener Achille Duchêne to create the water garden on the terrace at Blenheim. In 1934 he owned 19,685 acres of land.

However, Consuelo was far from happy; she recorded many of her problems in her autobiography &quot;The Glitter and the Gold&quot;. Consuelo was also unfaithful; her liaisons included her first love, Winthrop Rutherfurd (who was alleged to be the father of her second son, Lord Ivor, since he allegedly bore no resemblance to either the Duke or his brother), and three of her husband&#x27;s cousins: Hon. Freddie Guest (son of Ivor Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne, and Lady Cornelia Spencer-Churchill), Hon. Reginald Fellowes (son of William Fellowes, 2nd Baron de Ramsey, and Lady Rosamund Spencer-Churchill) and Charles, Viscount Castlereagh.

The couple shocked society by separating in 1906. In order to facilitate the divorce, Alva Vanderbilt testified that she had coerced her daughter into marrying the Duke. The couple were divorced in 1921; the marriage was annulled by the Vatican on 19 August 1926, no doubt facilitated by the Duke&#x27;s wish to become a Roman Catholic. Consuelo subsequently married a Frenchman, Jacques Balsan. She died in 1964, having lived to see her son become Duke of Marlborough; she frequently returned to Blenheim, the house she had found uncomfortable and inconvenient when living there.

In the late 1890s, the Duke invited to Blenheim Palace Gladys Deacon, another American, who became friends with Consuelo. Deacon, the daughter of Edward Parker Deacon, became the Duke&#x27;s mistress soon after moving into the palace. She and Marlborough were married on 25 June 1921 in Paris, shortly after his divorce from Consuelo.

Later in life the Duke converted to Catholicism in 1927, around which time the couple began drifting apart and Deacon took to keeping a revolver in her bedroom to prevent her husband’s entry. He moved out of the palace, and two years later evicted her. The couple separated but never divorced.

==In popular culture==
Marlborough was played by David Markham in the ITV drama &quot;Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years&quot;.

<text>The University of Massachusetts Lowell (UMass Lowell and UML) is a public research university in Lowell, Massachusetts, with a satellite campus in Haverhill, Massachusetts. It is the northernmost member of the University of Massachusetts public university system and has been accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE) since 1975. With 1,110 faculty members and over 18,000 students, it is the largest university in the Merrimack Valley and the second-largest public institution in the state. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research spending and doctorate production&quot;.

The university offers 120 bachelor&#x27;s degree, 43 master&#x27;s degree, and 25 doctoral degree programs, including nationally recognized programs in engineering, criminal justice, education, music, science, and technology. The university is one of the few public universities in the United States to offer accredited undergraduate degrees in meteorology, sound recording technology, nuclear engineering and plastics engineering. It was the first to offer a degree in music education. Academically, UMass Lowell is organized into six schools and colleges: the College of Fine Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences; the College of Education; the Kennedy College of Sciences; the Francis College of Engineering; the Manning School of Business; and the Zuckerberg College of Health Sciences.

==History==

The University of Massachusetts Lowell owes its origins to two institutions founded in the 1890s: Lowell State College on the south side of the Merrimack River and Lowell Technological Institute on the north side. Each would follow its own path of expansion through the 20th century.

===Lowell State College===
Lowell State College got its start as the Lowell Normal School, which was chartered in 1894 as a teacher-training institution for women. The 10th and final normal school to be established in Massachusetts, it opened in 1898 with 108 students and five faculty members. The original classroom building opened the next year at the corner of Broadway and Wilder streets, and quickly became a landmark in the city. Designed by local firm Stickney &amp; Austin, it reflects the fashion of the time: high-style Beaux Arts with classical symmetry, arches, cast-iron lampposts and yellow brick. Its design was influenced in part by Lowell High School, which was also designed by Lowell native Frederick W. Stickney. Frank Coburn, for whom the hall was later named, served as the school&#x27;s first principal until 1908.

After being threatened with closure during the Great Depression, school administrators rallied local support to help keep it open. A delegation of prominent individuals representing Lowell&#x27;s powerful interest groups traveled to Boston and convinced state officials of the school&#x27;s importance. The result was that the school not only survived, but continued to grow and expand. In 1950, Dr. Daniel O&#x27;Leary assumed the presidency and initiated an ambitious building program. The physical plant of the campus expanded during post-war era from a single structure to a multi-building complex, forming an area now known as UMass Lowell&#x27;s South Campus.

As the demand for more qualified teachers grew, the legislature reorganized the Normal School into Lowell State College in 1960 with a curriculum that expanded beyond education to include baccalaureate degrees in other fields including nursing and music. Beginning in 1967, the college was authorized to confer two more degrees: Master of Education and Master of Music Education.

===Lowell Technological Institute===
Established in 1895 as the Lowell Textile School, the institution was founded to train technicians and managers for work in Lowell&#x27;s booming textile industry. Modeled after the now-defunct Polytechnic College of Pennsylvania, Lowell Textile was the combined effort of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and corporations eager to form a school dedicated to textile education. Under the guidance of founder James T. Smith, Lowell Textile opened its doors in February 1897 in the upper floors of a downtown commercial block located on Middle Street. The school offered three-year training programs in cotton and wool manufacturing, design, textile chemistry and dyeing.

In 1903, the school moved from downtown to its permanent location just northwest of the Merrimack River. The yellow brick mill-like Southwick Hall was dedicated to Royal and Dierexa Southwick. Grandparents of the wealthy businessman Frederick Ayer, the Southwicks were Quakers and abolitionists who came to Lowell in the 1820s to help establish the Lowell Carpet Company. Ten years later, the school granted its first bachelor&#x27;s degrees in textile dyeing and textile engineering.

In 1953, President Martin Lydon expanded the curriculum to include programs in plastics, leather, paper and electronics technology, increased the liberal arts offerings and renamed the school the Lowell Technological Institute. He moved the institute decisively toward general engineering, setting up a bachelor&#x27;s program in 1956. The textile program was closed in 1971, reflecting the closure of most of the mills in the city.

===University of Lowell===
In 1972, a feasibility study was conducted on merging Lowell State College with Lowell Technological Institute. Lowell State and Lowell Tech merged in 1975 as the University of Lowell. Durgin Hall, with its 1000-seat performance venue, was dedicated as the home of the Music Department. The Manning School of Business (then the College of Management Science) was accredited. The College of Education became certified to offer a doctorate in education (Ed.D.). The College of Health Professions (now the Zuckerberg College of Health Sciences) was established. Enrollment increased 58% by 1985.

=== Merger with University of Massachusetts ===
In 1991, the Lowell campus joined the University of Massachusetts system under its current name. Under Chapter 142, the UMass system was restructured to combine the Amherst, Boston, and Worcester campuses with the University of Lowell and Southeastern Massachusetts University (now UMass Dartmouth).

=== Recent developments ===
In 2019, a sexual harassment complaint against Associate Dean Oliver Ibe was settled by the university. The complaint was from a younger female staff member in 2017. Ibe&#x27;s title of associate dean was removed and he returned to the faculty despite a petition from faculty and staff to have him removed from the campus. He retired the following year.

== Campus ==
UMass Lowell is the second-largest campus in the University of Massachusetts system, and has three campus clusters: North, South, and East. The university&#x27;s main facilities are located in Lowell, Massachusetts, 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Boston on both sides of the Merrimack River. Between 2013 and 2018, the university increased student housing by more than 2,500 beds, including opening three new residence halls in 2013, 2015, and 2017. In fall 2021, thirty-five percent of undergraduates lived in university–owned, operated, or affiliated housing, including sixty-one percent of first year students.

== Organization and administration ==
The university is governed by a six-member executive cabinet, including and led by the chancellor. The current chancellor is Julie Chen, who was appointed in May 2022. Marty Meehan, former UMass Lowell Chancellor, is currently the president of the entire University of Massachusetts system. He assumed office in July 2015 after serving as the chancellor since September 2007.

== Academics ==
The University of Massachusetts Lowell has an acceptance rate of 72 percent, a freshman retention rate of 85 percent, and a graduation rate of 63 percent. In 2016, 87% of first-year students rated their overall educational experience as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;excellent&quot;. The average combined SAT score (Critical Reading and Math) for incoming freshmen for fall 2018 was 1233, up nearly 150 points since fall 2010, and the average entering GPA was a 3.60, up from 3.18 in fall 2010. 47% of undergraduate classes had 20 students or fewer in the fall 2018 semester. In 2018 UMass awarded a total of 2,798 Bachelor&#x27;s, 1,102 Master&#x27;s and 122 Doctoral degrees.

<text>There are only five Pillars of Islam that are universally accepted as the basis of Islamic practice. However, the Kharijites upheld the belief that Jihad may be considered the sixth pillar. In their interpretation, jihad could be an individual&#x27;s internal struggle against baser instincts, the struggle to build a good Muslim society, or a war for the faith against unbelievers. Jihad is a vague term for the act of promoting Islam or improving observance of Islamic practices and may range from defending one&#x27;s religion against aggressors when attacked to struggle against the lower self (against ones ego) meaning self-improvement .

In Twelver Shi&#x27;a Islam, the second-largest branch of Islam, jihad is one of the ten Practices of the Religion.

Jihad was brought up in controversial magazine &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot;, which suffered a terrorist attack in 2015, stirred controversy with its coverage of Tariq Ramadan, with a headline that associated him with the Sixth Pillar of Islam. It was brought up since jihad is the pillar that sustains this type of practice in Islam.

<doc id="251938" wikidata="Q1459668" url="?curid=251938" title="Where's the beef?">
<text>&quot;Where&#x27;s the beef?&quot; is a catchphrase in the United States and Canada, introduced as a slogan for the fast food chain Wendy&#x27;s in 1984. Since then it has become an all-purpose phrase questioning the substance of an idea, event, or product.

==History==

The phrase first came to the public audience in a U.S. television commercial for the Wendy&#x27;s chain of hamburger restaurants in 1984. The strategy behind the campaign was to distinguish competitors&#x27; (McDonald&#x27;s and Burger King) big name hamburgers (Big Mac and Whopper respectively) from Wendy&#x27;s &quot;modest&quot; Single by focusing on the large bun used by the competitors and the larger beef patty in Wendy&#x27;s hamburger.

In the ad, titled &quot;Fluffy Bun&quot;, an elderly woman, played by actress Clara Peller, receives a burger with a large bun but a comically small patty from a fictional competitor, which uses the slogan &quot;Home of the Big Bun&quot;. The small patty angers the woman, who exclaims &quot;Where&#x27;s the beef?&quot;

Director Joe Sedelmaier actually wanted Peller to say, &quot;Where is all the beef?&quot; but Peller was unable to say the original line due to emphysema.

The commercial was originally supposed to star a young couple, but Sedelmaier did not find the concept funny and changed it to the elderly women.

An earlier version, featuring a middle-aged bald man saying, &quot;Thanks, but where&#x27;s the beef?&quot;, failed to make much impact. After the Peller version, the catchphrase was repeated in television shows, films, magazines, and other media outlets.

First airing in 1984, the original commercial featured three elderly women at the &quot;Home of the Big Bun&quot; examining an exaggeratedly large hamburger bun. The other two women poke at it, exchanging bemused comments (&quot;It certainly is a &quot;big&quot; bun. It&#x27;s a &quot;very big&quot; bun. It&#x27;s a &quot;big fluffy&quot; bun. It&#x27;s a &quot;very big fluffy&quot;—&quot;). As one of the women lifts the top half of the bun, a comically minuscule hamburger patty with cheese and a pickle is revealed (prompting her to finish the sentence &quot;—bun.&quot; with a much more disappointed tone). Peller immediately responds with her outraged, irascible question.

Sequels featured Peller yelling at a Fluffy Bun executive from his yacht over the phone and approaching fast food drive-up windows (including the &quot;Home of the Big Bun&quot; and a restaurant with a golden arch) that were slammed down before she could complete the line.

Later in 1984, Nashville songwriter and DJ Coyote McCloud wrote and performed a hit song entitled &quot;Where&#x27;s the Beef?&quot; as a promotion for Wendy&#x27;s restaurants&#x27; famous advertising campaign featuring Clara Peller.

The advertising campaign ended in 1985 after Peller performed in a commercial for Prego pasta sauce, saying &quot;I found it, I really found it&quot;, a phrase alluding to the beef in the listener&#x27;s mind.

There were many &quot;Where&#x27;s the beef?&quot; promotional items, including bumper stickers, frisbees, clothing patches, a Milton Bradley game, and more.

In 2011, Wendy&#x27;s revived the phrase for its new ad campaign, finally answering its own question with &quot;Here&#x27;s the beef&quot;.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in 2020, when stores were experiencing a shortage of beef, Wendy&#x27;s revived the ad.

To launch their new breakfast menu in Canada, Wendy&#x27;s released a new advertisement campaign called &quot;Where&#x27;s the Bacon?&quot; as a callback to the &quot;Where&#x27;s the Beef?&quot; campaign. The new campaign is similar to its older counterpart, except it focuses on the amount of bacon in breakfast sandwiches rather than beef size.

For the 2023 Daytona 500, Legacy Motor Club driver Noah Gragson, sponsored by Wendy&#x27;s, uses the No. 42 Chevrolet Camaro carrying &quot;The Beef&quot; on the hood, and a video released by the team featured Gragson using the phrase in the promotional video.

==Credits==
William Welter, the executive vice president of Wendy&#x27;s International, led the marketing team at the time of the campaign. The commercial was directed by Joe Sedelmaier as part of a campaign by the advertising agency Dancer Fitzgerald Sample. It was written by Cliff Freeman. The marketing and promotion campaign were created by Alan Hilburg and the Burson-Marsteller team under the direction of Denny Lynch, the vice president of corporate communications at Wendy&#x27;s.

==Use in politics==
===1984 Democratic presidential primaries===
The phrase became associated with the 1984 United States presidential election. During primaries in the spring of 1984, when the commercial was at its height of popularity, Democratic candidate and former Vice President Walter Mondale used the phrase to sum up his arguments that program policies championed by his rival, Senator Gary Hart, were insubstantial, beginning with a March 11, 1984, televised debate at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta prior to the New York and Pennsylvania primaries.

Hart had moved his candidacy from dark horse to the lead over Mondale based on allegedly superficial similarities to John F. Kennedy, and his repeated use of the phrase &quot;new ideas&quot;. When Hart once again used the slogan in the debate, Mondale leaned forward and said, &quot;When I hear your new ideas, I&#x27;m reminded of that ad, &#x27;Where&#x27;s the beef? Subsequently, the two campaigns continually clashed using the two dueling slogans, Hart frequently showing reams of policy papers and retorting &quot;Here&#x27;s the beef.&quot; Mondale&#x27;s strategy succeeded in casting doubt on Hart&#x27;s new ideas, and changing the debate to specific details, earning him the Democratic presidential nomination.

<text>A catchphrase (alternatively spelled catch phrase) is a phrase or expression recognized by its repeated utterance. Such phrases often originate in popular culture and in the arts, and typically spread through word of mouth and a variety of mass media (such as films, internet, literature and publishing, television, and radio). Some become the de facto or literal &quot;trademark&quot; or &quot;signature&quot; of the person or character with whom they originated, and can be instrumental in the typecasting of a particular actor. Catchphrases are often humorous, can be (or become) the punch line of a joke, or a callback reminder of a previous joke.

==Culture==
According to Richard Harris, a psychology professor at Kansas State University who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotes in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. &quot;People are doing it to feel good about themselves, to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh,&quot; he said. He found that all of the participants in his study had used film quotes in conversation at one point or another. &quot;They overwhelmingly cited comedies, followed distantly by dramas and action adventure flicks.&quot; Horror films, musicals and children&#x27;s films were hardly ever cited.

==History==
The existence of catchphrases predates modern mass media. A description of the phenomenon is found in &quot;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&quot; published by Charles Mackay in 1841:

And, first of all, walk where we will, we cannot help hearing from every side a phrase repeated with delight, and received with laughter, by men with hard hands and dirty faces, by saucy butcher lads and errand-boys, by loose women, by hackney coachmen, cabriolet-drivers, and idle fellows who loiter at the corners of streets. Not one utters this phrase without producing a laugh from all within hearing. It seems applicable to every circumstance, and is the universal answer to every question; in short, it is the favourite slang phrase of the day, a phrase that, while its brief season of popularity lasts, throws a dash of fun and frolicsomeness over the existence of squalid poverty and ill-requited labour, and gives them reason to laugh as well as their more fortunate fellows in a higher stage of society.

<text>The battles of the Mexican–American War include all major engagements and most reported skirmishes, including Thornton&#x27;s Defeat, the Battle of Palo Alto, and the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, which took place prior to the official start of hostilities.

==Background==
The Mexican–American War lasted from 1846 until 1848. It grew out of unresolved border disputes between the Republic of Texas and Mexico after the United States annexed Texas nine years after the Texas Revolution. It ended in 1848 with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in which Mexico was forced to sell a vast tract of land that amounted to almost half its national territory to the United States.

<text>Sir Andrew Motion (born 26 October 1952) is an English poet, novelist, and biographer, who was Poet Laureate from 1999 to 2009. During the period of his laureateship, Motion founded the Poetry Archive, an online resource of poems and audio recordings of poets reading their own work. In 2012, he became President of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, taking over from Bill Bryson.

==Early life==

Motion was born on 26 October 1952 in London, to (Andrew) Richard Michael Motion (1921-2006), a brewer at Ind Coope, and (Catherine) Gillian (née Bakewell; 1928–1978). Richard Motion was from a brewing dynasty; his grandfather founded Taylor Walker, but by Richard Motion&#x27;s time this had been absorbed by Ind Coope. The Motion family were wealthy armigers who lived at Upton House, Banbury, Oxfordshire, and were prominent in the local area; Richard Motion&#x27;s grandfather Andrew Richard Motion was a Justice of the Peace for Essex, Oxfordshire and Warwickshire, who had worked his way up from being a brewery labourer in the East End of London to ownership of his own successful brewery. When his children had grown up and married, he sold the Upton House estate and went to live at Stisted Hall, in Essex.

When Motion was 12 years old, the family moved to Glebe House at Stisted, near Braintree in Essex, where Richard Motion&#x27;s grandparents had previously lived at Stisted Hall, by that time converted into a home for the elderly. Motion went to boarding school from the age of seven joined by his younger brother. Most of his friends were from the school and so when Motion was in the village, he spent a lot of time on his own. He began to have an interest and affection for the countryside, and he went for walks with a pet dog. Later he went to Radley College, where, in the sixth form, he encountered Peter Way, an inspiring English teacher who introduced him to poetry – first Thomas Hardy, then Philip Larkin, W. H. Auden, Seamus Heaney, Ted Hughes, Wordsworth and Keats.

When Motion was 17 years old, his mother had a horse-riding accident and suffered a serious head injury requiring a lifesaving neurosurgery operation. She regained some speech, but she was severely paralysed and remained in and out of coma for nine years. She died in 1978 and her husband died of cancer in 2006. Motion has said that he wrote to keep his memory of his mother alive. When Motion was about 18 years old, he moved away from the village to study English at University College, Oxford; however, since then he has remained in contact with the village to visit the church graveyard, where his parents are buried, and also to see his brother, who lives nearby. At university he studied at weekly sessions with W. H. Auden, whom he greatly admired. Motion won the university&#x27;s Newdigate Prize and graduated with a first class honours degree. This was followed by an MLitt on the poetry of Edward Thomas.

==Career==
Between 1976 and 1980, Motion taught English at the University of Hull and while there, at the age of 24, he had his first volume of poetry published. At Hull he met the university librarian and poet Philip Larkin. Motion was later appointed as one of Larkin&#x27;s literary executors, which would privilege Motion&#x27;s role as his biographer following Larkin&#x27;s death in 1985. In &quot;Philip Larkin: A Writer&#x27;s Life&quot;, Motion says that at no time during their nine-year friendship did they discuss writing his biography and it was Larkin&#x27;s longtime companion Monica Jones who requested it. He reports how, as executor, he rescued many of Larkin&#x27;s papers from imminent destruction following his friend&#x27;s death. His 1993 biography of Larkin, which won the Whitbread Prize for Biography, was responsible for bringing about a substantial revision of Larkin&#x27;s reputation.

Motion was editorial director and poetry editor at Chatto &amp; Windus (1983–89); he edited the Poetry Society&#x27;s &quot;Poetry Review&quot; from 1980 to 1982 and succeeded Malcolm Bradbury as professor of creative writing at the University of East Anglia. He is now on the faculty at the Johns Hopkins Writing Seminars.

===Laureateship===
Motion was appointed Poet Laureate on 1 May 1999, following the death of Ted Hughes, the previous incumbent. The Nobel Prize–winning Northern Irish poet and translator Seamus Heaney had ruled himself out for the post. Breaking with the tradition of the laureate retaining the post for life, Motion stipulated that he would stay for only ten years. The yearly stipend of £200 was increased to £5,000 and he received the customary butt of sack. He wanted to write &quot;poems about things in the news, and commissions from people or organisations involved with ordinary life&quot;, rather than be seen as a &#x27;courtier&#x27;. So, he wrote &quot;for the TUC about liberty, about homelessness for the Salvation Army, about bullying for ChildLine, about the foot and mouth outbreak for the &quot;Today&quot; programme, about the Paddington rail disaster, the 11 September attacks and Harry Patch for the BBC, and more recently about shell shock for the charity Combat Stress, and climate change for the song cycle he finished for Cambridge University with Peter Maxwell Davies.&quot;

On 14 March 2002, as part of the &#x27;Re-weaving Rainbows&#x27; event of National Science Week 2002, Motion unveiled a blue plaque on the front wall of 28 St Thomas Street, Southwark, to commemorate the sharing of lodgings there by John Keats and Henry Stephens while they were medical students at Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in 1815–16.

In 2003, Motion wrote &quot;Regime change&quot;, a poem in protest at the Invasion of Iraq from the point of view of Death walking the streets during the conflict, and in 2005, &quot;Spring Wedding&quot; in honour of the wedding of the Prince of Wales to Camilla Parker Bowles. Commissioned to write in the honour of 109-year-old Harry Patch, the last surviving &quot;Tommy&quot; to have fought in the First World War, Motion composed a five-part poem, read and received by Patch at the Bishop&#x27;s Palace in Wells in 2008.

As laureate, he also founded the Poetry Archive, an on-line library of historic and contemporary recordings of poets reciting their own work.

Motion remarked that he found some of the duties attendant to the post of poet laureate difficult and onerous and that the appointment had been &quot;very, very damaging to [his] work&quot;. The appointment of Motion met with criticism from some quarters. As he prepared to stand down from the job, Motion published an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that concluded, &quot;To have had 10 years working as laureate has been remarkable. Sometimes it&#x27;s been remarkably difficult, the laureate has to take a lot of flak, one way or another. More often it has been remarkably fulfilling. I&#x27;m glad I did it, and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m giving it up – especially since I mean to continue working for poetry.&quot;

Motion spent his last day as Poet Laureate holding a creative writing class at his alma mater, Radley College, before giving a poetry reading and thanking Peter Way, the man who taught him English at Radley, for making him who he was. Carol Ann Duffy succeeded him as Poet Laureate on 1 May 2009.

===Post-laureateship===
Motion is chairman of the Arts Council of England&#x27;s literature panel (appointed 1996) and is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. In 2003, he became professor of creative writing at Royal Holloway, University of London. Since July 2009, Motion has been Chairman of the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) appointed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. He is also a vice-president of the Friends of the British Library, a charity which provides funding support to the British Library. He was knighted in the 2009 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours list. He has been a member of English Heritage&#x27;s Blue Plaques Panel since 2008.

Motion was selected as jury chair for the Man Booker Prize 2010 and in March 2010, he announced that he was working with publishers Jonathan Cape on a sequel to Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. Entitled &quot;Silver&quot;, the story is set a generation on from the original book and was published in March 2012. In July 2010, Motion returned to Kingston-upon-Hull for the annual &quot;Humber Mouth&quot; literature festival and taking part in the Larkin 25 festival commemorating the 25th anniversary of Philip Larkin&#x27;s death. In his capacity as Larkin&#x27;s biographer and as a former lecturer in English at the University of Hull, Motion named an East Yorkshire Motor Services bus &quot;Philip Larkin&quot;. Motion&#x27;s debut play &quot;Incoming&quot;, about the war in Afghanistan, premièred at the High Tides Festival in Halesworth, Suffolk in May 2011. Motion also featured in &quot;Jamie&#x27;s Dream School&quot; in 2011 as the poetry teacher.

In June 2012, he became the President of the Campaign to Protect Rural England. In March 2014 he was elected an Honorary Fellow at Homerton College, Cambridge.

Motion won the 2015 Ted Hughes Award for new work in poetry for the radio programme &quot;Coming Home&quot;. The production featured poetry by Motion based on recordings he made of British soldiers returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In 2017 Motion moved to Baltimore, Maryland to take up a post at the Writing Seminars as a Homewood Professor of the Arts at Johns Hopkins University.

==Work==
Motion has said of himself: &quot;My wish to write a poem is inseparable from my wish to explain something to myself.&quot; His work combines lyrical and narrative aspects in a &quot;postmodern-romantic sensibility&quot;. Motion says that he aims to write in clear language without tricks.

&quot;The Independent&quot; describes the stalwart poet as the &quot;charming and tireless defender of the art form&quot;. Motion has won the Arvon Prize, the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, Eric Gregory Award, Whitbread Prize for Biography and the Dylan Thomas Prize.

Motion took part in the Bush Theatre&#x27;s 2011 project &quot;Sixty-Six Books&quot;, writing and performing a piece based upon a book of the &quot;King James Bible&quot;.

==Personal life==
Motion&#x27;s marriage to Joanna Powell ended in 1983. He was married to Jan Dalley from 1985 to 2009, divorcing after a seven-year separation. They had one son born in 1986 and twins, a son and a daughter, born in 1988. In 2010 he married Kyeong-Soo Kim. He currently lives part of the year in Baltimore, Maryland, in the United States.

<doc id="251951" wikidata="Q373543" url="?curid=251951" title="Blowgun">
<text>A blowgun (also called a blowpipe or blow tube) is a simple ranged weapon consisting of a long narrow tube for shooting light projectiles such as darts. It operates by having the projectile placed inside the pipe and using the force created by forced exhalation (&quot;blow&quot;) to pneumatically propel the projectile. The propulsive power is limited by the strength of the user&#x27;s respiratory muscles and the vital capacity of their lungs.

==History==

Many cultures have used such a weapon, but various indigenous and aboriginal peoples of East Asia, Southeast Asia, Western Europe, North America, Central America (the Huehuetenango region of Guatemala), and South America (the Amazon Basin and the Guianas) are best known for its historical usage.

Projectiles include seeds, clay pellets, and darts. Some cultures dip the tip of the darts in curare or other arrow poisons in order to paralyze the target. Blowguns were very rarely used by these tribes as anti-personnel weapons, but primarily to hunt small animals such as monkeys and birds. The North American Cherokee were known for making blowguns from river cane to supplement their diet with rabbits and other small creatures. The Choctaw Indians of North America also made use of cane blowguns to hunt squirrel and birds.

Blowguns are depicted in paintings on pre-Columbian pottery and are mentioned in many Mesoamerican myths. Back then and today, the Maya use a blowgun to hunt birds and small animals with spherical dry seeds and clay pellets. The clay ammunition is made slightly larger than needed (to allow for shrinkage and refinement) and stored in a shoulderbag. The outside of the dry clay pellet is shaved off and burnished right before use.

Shorter blowguns and smaller bore darts were used for varmint hunting by pre-adolescent boys in traditional Cherokee villages. They used the blowguns to reduce the population of small rodents such as rats, mice, chipmunks and other mammals that cut or gnaw into food caches, seed and vegetable stores, or that are attracted to the planted vegetables. While this custom gave the boys something to do around the village and kept them out of mischief, it also worked as an early form of pest control. Some food was also obtained by the boys, who hunted squirrels with blowguns well into the 20th century.

Today blowguns are used with tranquilizer darts to capture wildlife or to stun caged dangerous animals. Herpetologists use blowguns to capture elusive lizards with stun darts. Blowguns are also used recreationally, with either darts or paintballs.

==Sport blowgun==
There are several competition styles practised around the world. A standardization of competition style, based upon fukiya, is being pursued by the International Fukiyado Association and hopes to become an Olympic event. It is a target shooting, using a standardized length 120 cm or 48 inch, and barrel caliber, dart shape, length and weight are free. In each round the shooter shoots 5 darts and there are 6 rounds per game, for a total of 30 darts. The target faces are 7 (6 cm), 5 (12 cm), 3 (18 cm) points. The bullseye is 160 cm or 63inches above the floor.

Two other styles are also being pursued to make up the Olympic blowgun event, both based upon the Cherokee Annual Gathering Blowgun Competition. The Field Style competition is similar to the winter Biathlon, where the shooter runs from a starting line to a target lane, shoots and retrieves the darts, and continues to the next station. The course length varies from or longer, with from 9 to 16 targets at various heights and shooting distances. The final style is the Long Distance target shoot. The target is a circle of diameter, and the firing line is away. Three darts are fired by each shooter, at least one of which must stick in the target. All successful shooters move to the next round, moving back each time.

The sport blowgun competition is managed by the International Fukiyado Association, with which national associations in the United States, France, Germany, and the Philippines are affiliated.

==Materials==
Darts are typically made of hardwoods to prevent cracking, although bamboo skewers can be used informally. The dart&#x27;s fletch can be made of many materials, such as down, feather tips, and animal fur. Modern materials, such as aluminium or carbon-reinforced plastic, are also used.

In Japan, the competition darts are made of cellophane rolled into a cone (Fukiya), topped with a non-pointed brass brad. The Japan Sports Fukiya Association JSFA has privatized the sport, and all materials must be purchased from them. International Fukiya Association IFA chairman H.Higuchi promotes worldwide blowgun rule cooperating with other countries.

In other nations, modified piano wire is used to make the  cal and  cal darts, with certain manufacturers making specialty darts for odd sized or larger caliber barrels ( cal,  cal,  cal, and  cal).

Use of home-made darts in the larger sizes, or for hunting is common, utilizing bamboo skewers ( diameter), wire coat hangers, and even nails, or knitting needles.

==Specifications==
As a primitive weapon, there are no set dimension for a blowgun&#x27;s length and diameter. However, generally there are several sizes:
# Fukidake — diameter is  cal in Japan. Tournament length is , but for practice one can use a tube. No mouthpiece is used; users wrap their lips around the tube. International versions can be slightly more flexible, allowing a tube of and  cal under IFA rules. Darts consist of a paper cone long, weighing .
# Cherokee – made of river cane, . Dart is long and made of locustwood or other available hardwoods such as oak, ash, maple, walnut, etc., fletched with thistle down or rabbit fur, that provides an air seal.
# Jakaltek — wooden blowgun averages long with a sight placed from the end. Clay pellets are the most common type of ammunition and clay is sometimes added under the sight when the diameter of the blowgun is too thin for more stability and a better aim. 
# Modern (US/EU) — typically has a diameter of  cal, however, both the  cal and  cal are admitted for competitive shooting, with restrictions on barrel length and darts dimensions/weight; with varying lengths having distance restrictions imposed. Bell-shaped mouthpiece. Standard length limited to in IFA sanctioned competition.
# Paintball marker — made to be identical to the size of a  cal paintball.
# Sumpit — usually about in length and in diameter. It is made from bamboo or wood, and can be a single piece or two to three pieces joined. Metal spearheads are uniquely commonly affixed at the tip, allowing them to also be used as stabbing weapons. They use thick short darts with soft cork plugs or resin-coated feathers or fibers at the blunt end. Bird-hunting versions can use clay pellets.

==Legality==
A law passed in Guatemala in the 1930s outlawed the use of the blowgun in an effort to protect small game. It was difficult to enforce in rural areas, but was one of the reasons for the decline of blowgun use in Guatemala.

In the United Kingdom under the Criminal Justice Act 1988, and in Australia, the blowgun is categorized as an offensive weapon, and as such it is illegal to manufacture, sell or hire or offer for sale or hire, expose or have in one&#x27;s possession for the purpose of sale or hire, or lend or give to any other person. Antique blowguns are, however, exempt.

In Canada, the blowgun is classified as a prohibited weapon and is defined as any device that &quot;being a tube or pipe designed for the purpose of shooting arrows or darts by the breath&quot;. Any imported blowgun must be deactivated by either drilling a hole or by blocking.

In the Republic of Ireland, blowpipes (blow guns) are classified as illegal offensive weapons.

In the U.S. state of California, blowguns are illegal. They are also illegal in Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., but are legal elsewhere. There is currently no age requirement for using a blowgun.

==Poisoned darts==
Shooting darts with a blowgun is an extremely stealthy, and even lethal, hunting technique if the darts are poisoned with plant extracts or animal secretions. In Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, some isolated areas in South America, and in the Amazon and Orinoco basins, blowgun hunters fill the tips of their darts with &quot;curare&quot;. The explorer Joseph Gumilla first mentioned the use of this poison. In ancient literature, it&#x27;s also referred to as &quot;uiraêry&quot;, &quot;uirary&quot;, &quot;uraré&quot;, &quot;woorara&quot;, and &quot;wourali&quot;.

The Ticuas, an ethnic group from Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, produce a type of &quot;curare&quot; called &quot;Ticuna&quot;. This poison acts quickly on the prey, killing birds like the toucan in a matter of three to four minutes and small monkeys in about eight to ten minutes.

In the Orinoco basin, the blowgun and curare are used by: the Hoti, who make blowguns that are unique in their components; the Panare, who obtain blowguns from the Hoti; the Huottuja, or Piaroa, who get their blowguns from the Yekuana or Maquiritares; the Maquiritare, who get their &quot;curare&quot; from the Piaroa; and the Pemones, who also get their blowguns from the Yekuana or Maquiritares, though they make their own &quot;curare&quot;.

In the upper Rio Negro basin, the combination of blowguns and poisoned darts is used by the Curripacos, or Banivas, who make their own blowguns using technology and materials different, in part, from those of the ethnic groups of the Orinoco. They also produce their own &quot;curare&quot;. Their ancestors, the Waodani, used a match known as &quot;kakapa&quot; along with the &quot;curare&quot; to impregnate the darts of their blowpipes.

The Piaroa are known for making &quot;curare&quot; to impregnate the darts of their blowguns. They produce it beginning with extracts of different species of plants from the Strychnos genus– mainly &quot;maracure&quot; (Strychnos crevauxii)– mixed with &quot;kraraguero&quot; sap to increase the adhesion of the poison. An animal hit by a dart poisoned using the Piaroa recipe usually dies within fifteen minutes, depending on its body mass.

In the Philippines, Borneo, and Sulawesi, the sumpit (or sumpitan) blowgun darts are typically coated in the sap of &quot;Antiaris toxicaria&quot; (&quot;upas&quot;)a toxin also used by the Orang Asli of Peninsular Malaysia⁠which causes convulsions and death by cardiac arrest. Uniquely among blowguns, sumpit are also commonly tipped with metal spearheads for use in close combat or when the ammunition is exhausted, functionally similar to bayonets.

<doc id="251954" wikidata="Q452590" url="?curid=251954" title="Sgt. Slaughter">
<text>Robert Rudolph Remus (born August 27, 1948), better known by his ring name Sgt. Slaughter, is an American voice actor and retired professional wrestler. He is currently signed to WWE in the ambassador program.

From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, Slaughter had success in the National Wrestling Alliance, American Wrestling Association, and the World Wrestling Federation. He won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and headlined WrestleMania VII in 1991. Slaughter also captured the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship twice. He is a WWE Hall of Famer, inducted as part of the class of 2004. As Sgt. Slaughter, Remus became known for his dark sunglasses, his campaign hat, and his Vietnam War-era military fatigues. In the 1980s, an alternate version of the Sgt. Slaughter character was incorporated into the &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot; toy line as well as its animated series and comic books.

The gimmick of Sgt. Slaughter is that of a former U.S. Marine who fought in the Vietnam War. Remus himself never served in the military. He received several draft deferments and even opposed the war, often protesting and demonstrating within the antiwar movement. This has caused controversy because, at times, Remus has talked about military service while seeming to be speaking as himself, and not in kayfabe character.

==Early life==
Remus was born in Detroit, Michigan, and grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He attended Eden Prairie High School in nearby Eden Prairie, where he wrestled and played football.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1972–1980)===
Remus was trained by Verne Gagne in Minnesota for American Wrestling Association (AWA) territory in 1972. In 1974, he made his debut in Portland, Oregon and Vancouver. Then he made his first tour in Japan in January 1975 for International Wrestling Enterprise and July 1975 for All Japan Pro wrestling.

Remus held numerous regional titles early in his career and experienced his second major success in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). In 1978, Remus returned to the American Wrestling Association under a mask as Super Destroyer Mark II with manager Lord Alfred Hayes, whom he dismissed and replaced with Bobby Heenan, leading to a feud between the two managers with Hayes as the babyface.

===World Wrestling Federation (1980–1981)===
He then signed with the WWF and was pushed as a villainous character. Between 1980 and 1981, Slaughter wrestled in the WWF under the guidance of the Grand Wizard. He very quickly rose to the status of number one contender on the strength of his &quot;cobra clutch&quot; challenges where he would seat wrestlers in a chair in the ring, and apply the hold, offering $5,000 to anyone who could break it. He would eventually face Bob Backlund for the World Wrestling Federation World Heavyweight Championship across the WWF territory in 1980, earning two-of-three falls main event matches in most markets. Slaughter was the only WWF-based challenger not to do the honors for Backlund at MSG (Backlund defeated him at the Meadowlands, but never in the Garden). Slaughter then engaged in a feud with Pat Patterson, which stemmed from Slaughter calling Patterson &quot;yellow&quot; and offering him $10,000 (double the usual amount) to try to break the cobra clutch. Patterson accepted on television and was escaping from the hold when Slaughter released it and put a beat-down on Patterson. This started a hot feud that culminated in an &quot;Alley Fight&quot; in New York, New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden between the two, which is widely regarded as the best &quot;hardcore&quot; match of the Kayfabe era.

===National Wrestling Alliance, Catch Wrestling Association (1981–1983)===
In September 1981, Slaughter joined the National Wrestling Alliance, mainly wrestling for its flagship territory Jim Crockett Promotions. In October 1981, he took part in a tournament to determine a new NWA United States Heavyweight Champion; he defeated Johnny Weaver, Jay Youngblood, and Rick Steamboat in the tournament to win the vacant title. He would hold onto the title for over seven months, before losing the title to Wahoo McDaniel in May 1982.

In September 1982, Slaughter and partner Don Kernodle were awarded the NWA World Tag Team Championship, claiming a title victory over Antonio Inoki and Giant Baba in Tokyo. They would be in a heated rivalry with the team of Rick Steamboat and Jay Youngblood, which culminated on March 12, 1983, losing the titles to Steamboat and Youngblood in a steel cage match in Greensboro, North Carolina. After the rivalry ended, Slaughter left JCP.

During this period, Slaughter also toured Germany and Austria for the Catch Wrestling Association, twice (in 1982 and 1983) unsuccessfully challenging CWA World Heavyweight Champion Otto Wanz.

===Return to WWF (1983–1984)===

Slaughter returned to the WWF in March 1983, and again took on the Grand Wizard as his manager. He immediately targeted Backlund, who was still the reigning WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Slaughter turned up the feud another notch when he attacked Backlund at a television taping; Backlund was in the process of completing the Harvard step test before Slaughter beat him repeatedly with his riding crop, leaving bruises on his back. Although he won several matches by disqualification, he never won the title.

In early 1984, Slaughter&#x27;s career took off after he turned face and defended America&#x27;s honor against The Iron Sheik from Iran. They had many matches throughout the year, culminating in a boot camp match that took place before a sold-out Madison Square Garden that summer. With Hulk Hogan rising as the WWF World Heavyweight Champion and lead face within the company, Slaughter left for the AWA.

On Vince McMahon&#x27;s &quot;McMahon&quot; DVD, Slaughter said he was fired by McMahon in Toronto after no-showing an event in protest of McMahon&#x27;s refusal to give him six weeks of paid vacation. Other interviews with Slaughter and McMahon have revealed that Slaughter left the company more over a dispute that emerged due to the WWF not allowing Slaughter&#x27;s role in the G.I. Joe toy line. Sports editor and columnist Lew Freedman wrote of Slaughter&#x27;s popularity in the wake of his face turn in August 1985: &quot;Talk about your overnight sensations. Slaughter had been wrestling for 10 years and suddenly he was hotter than Dwight Gooden&quot;.

===American Wrestling Association (1985–1990)===

He received a considerable push in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) throughout 1985 and 1986, becoming the AWA America&#x27;s Heavyweight Champion, defeating Larry Zbyszko shortly after his arrival. He defended the title against wrestlers like Zbyszko, Kamala, Boris Zukhov, and Nick Bockwinkel (before the belt was retired) and feuded with Sheik Adnan Al-Kaissey and his stable of wrestlers, The Road Warriors, and Colonel DeBeers. He even challenged Stan Hansen for the AWA title. He was also involved in the short-lived Pro Wrestling USA Promotion. This was a brief attempt at pulling together the remaining wrestling talent to go up against the rising WWF. Slaughter in this company won a large 25-man battle royal by eliminating Kamala, winning the right to challenge Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.

In 1988, Slaughter returned to wrestling in the AWA, resuming some of his past feuds with the likes of Sheik Adnan Al-Kaissey, the Iron Sheik, and Col. DeBeers. He also became a top contender to the AWA World title during Larry Zbyszko&#x27;s reign in 1989 and was a team captain for the AWA&#x27;s ill-fated Team Challenge Series during the first half of 1990. The AWA even teased fans with Slaughter appearing to win the World title from Zbyszko live on ESPN, only to have the decision reversed on a technicality (a booking practice the AWA had been employing for years).

=== Second return to the WWF (1990–1994) ===

====Iraqi sympathizer (1990–1991)====
After WrestleMania VI, Slaughter sent a letter to Vince McMahon saying he loved the program and was interested in returning. McMahon told Slaughter he wanted a heel, and his new gimmick would be that Slaughter turned on the United States due to its acceptance of the Russian Nikolai Volkoff to Slaughter, he found it difficult to do the anti-American promos associated with this gimmick.

The August 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Ba&#x27;athist Iraq triggered a political crisis that would lead to the 1991 Gulf War, in which Kuwait was freed by a U.S.-led military coalition. A decision was made to have Slaughter support the Iraqi cause, not for the actual political reasons, but more for the fact that Slaughter liked &quot;brutality&quot; and the Iraqi government was &quot;brutal&quot; while the US regime was said by Slaughter to have become &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;weak&quot;. Slaughter aligned himself with an Iraqi enthusiast and kayfabe Iraqi military general, General Adnan (his old rival who left the AWA shortly after Slaughter did), and entered a feud with Volkoff (which saw Slaughter win the majority of their encounters at house shows), leading to a match at that year&#x27;s Survivor Series which saw The Alliance (Volkoff, Tito Santana, and The Bushwhackers) defeat The Mercenaries (Slaughter, Boris Zhukov, and The Orient Express (professional wrestling)). As part of his character change, Slaughter began wearing Arab headdresses to the ring, adopted the Camel Clutch as one of his finishers, and was (kayfabe) photographed meeting with Saddam Hussein. Slaughter also infamously adopted a move where he would grind the tip of one of his knuckles into his opponent&#x27;s temple. It was reported that while Slaughter was portraying a turncoat, he had received numerous death threats and could not go anywhere in public without wearing a bullet-proof vest and had to be surrounded with security personnel at all times. According to Slaughter, Vince asked him to burn the American flag, but Slaughter refused to do that, so Slaughter suggested he burn Hulk Hogan&#x27;s shirt.

As 1990 ended, Slaughter began challenging for the WWF Championship that had been held by The Ultimate Warrior since WrestleMania VI. Slaughter got his chance at the Royal Rumble in January 1991, days after the Gulf War air campaign had begun. He defeated the Warrior when &quot;Macho King&quot; Randy Savage, who had also been feuding with the Warrior at the time, struck the champion in the head with his royal scepter. Slaughter thus became the thirteenth WWF Champion and was immediately challenged by Royal Rumble winner Hulk Hogan, who was furious that Slaughter had (kayfabe) desecrated the American flag (off-screen) as part of his victory celebration. Hogan demanded a match against Slaughter at WrestleMania VII in Los Angeles, California, and Slaughter accepted. Slaughter lost the WWF Championship to Hogan at WrestleMania. After WrestleMania, Slaughter introduced his newest ally, Colonel Mustafa (The Iron Sheik, Slaughter&#x27;s old nemesis). Slaughter and company went on to feud with Hogan for months, including having a three-on-two handicap match at SummerSlam, which saw the team of Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior prevail over Slaughter, Adnan, and Mustafa.

====Various feuds (1991–1994)====
After finishing the Hogan feud, Slaughter became a face again, appearing in vignettes next to American landmarks, saying, &quot;I want my country back&quot;. During an episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, Jim Duggan was under attack from The Nasty Boys, and Slaughter made the save. Duggan and Slaughter teamed up to defeat the Nasty Boys and continued to team over the next several months. Slaughter would also feud with General Adnan and Col. Mustafa, winning every match in his feud with the heel duo. Slaughter was taken off TV in June 1992 and worked in house shows against The Mountie until August of that year. Slaughter&#x27;s last regular WWF match, which was against Nailz, was in October 1992 and ended in no contest when Nailz viciously attacked Slaughter before the match could begin.

Slaughter started appearing as an on-air official from October 1992 to June 1994. He made his first wrestling appearance in over a year when he appeared on a house show version of a Royal Rumble that was held on January 17, 1994, at Madison Square Garden. After helping to eliminate Adam Bomb he, in turn, was tossed out by Crush. Later that year he would wrestle on four house shows in July in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, facing and defeating Quebecer Pierre. He left the company in September.

===Third return to the WWF (1997–2009)===
====WWF Commissioner and sporadic appearances (1997–2009)====
After a hiatus, he returned to WWF television on the August 4, 1997, episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; to assume the role of on-air commissioner by (kayfabe) President Gorilla Monsoon who in reality retired from being on camera due to health issues. Initially popular, he eventually became the target of D-Generation X (DX), who called him &quot;Sgt. Slobber&quot;. On an episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, he put Shawn Michaels and Triple H in a match for Michaels&#x27; European Championship. Michaels dropped the belt to Helmsley by lying down in the ring. Slaughter challenged Triple H to a Boot Camp match at the December pay-per-view, which he lost. His feud with Triple H continued into WrestleMania XIV where he handcuffed himself to Chyna to prevent her from interfering with Helmsley&#x27;s match against Owen Hart. But Slaughter&#x27;s efforts ultimately proved futile, as Chyna threw powder into his eyes, interfered with the match anyway, and hurled Slaughter into the front row.

In 1998, Slaughter turned heel, joined Vince McMahon along with Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson, and became the on-screen lackeys of McMahon; running errands for him and dishing out punishment to McMahon&#x27;s rivals, namely Steve Austin. In late 1998, Slaughter relinquished the role of commissioner to Shawn Michaels and largely disappeared from television. On September 15, on Raw, Slaughter lost to Al Snow in a Boot Camp match.

Slaughter still appeared from time to time in the ring, mostly at house shows. He appeared on &quot;Raw&quot; to put over younger wrestlers, such as Kurt Angle and Funaki. Slaughter also made an appearance at WrestleMania X-Seven, in the gimmick Battle Royal, which was won by The Iron Sheik. Slaughter got his revenge after the match by locking the Sheik in the cobra clutch. He also appeared on both &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot; on occasion during the Invasion storyline in non-wrestling roles, usually in conjunction with Vince McMahon.

On November 24, 2003, he lost to Randy Orton on &quot;Raw&quot; as Orton became the Legend Killer.

On January 31, 2005, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he lost to (kayfabe) Saudi Arabian wrestler Muhammad Hassan. He made a special appearance on June 13, 2005, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to challenge Chris Masters in his &quot;Master Lock Challenge&quot;, which Slaughter lost. Then, he returned again on December 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where he and Michael Hayes confronted Edge. He also appeared on the July 4, 2006 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; for a &quot;Diva Boot Camp&quot; segment, as a part of the 2006 Diva Search Competition.

He re-appeared on October 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, defeating Nicky from the Spirit Squad with a roll-up when D-Generation X (DX) distracted him from up on the TitanTron. Slaughter appeared on the October 23 &quot;Raw&quot; in the corner of Ric Flair as he faced Kenny of the Spirit Squad. After Kenny cheated to gain the victory, Slaughter, Dusty Rhodes, and Roddy Piper cleared the tag champions from the ring. Slaughter was one of three options between himself, Roddy Piper, and Dusty Rhodes that fans could vote for as a tag partner for Ric Flair at Cyber Sunday, but did not win the vote. At Survivor Series, Slaughter teamed with Flair, Ron Simmons, and Dusty Rhodes to take on four members of the Spirit Squad in a Survivor Series match. Slaughter was eliminated in the match, but his team won, with Flair as the sole survivor.

On December 18, 2006, Slaughter participated in a 30-man battle royal for a chance to face John Cena in the main event for the WWE Championship, but he was eliminated from the match and did not get the title shot. At the pay-per-view in June 2007, he faced Deuce &#x27;n Domino for the WWE Tag Team Championship, alongside Jimmy Snuka. They were unsuccessful in their attempt for the titles. He challenged Randy Orton on July 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, only to become another victim of the &quot;Legend Killer&quot; and was wheeled out on a stretcher. On &quot;Raw XV&quot;, the 15th-anniversary &quot;Raw&quot; special on December 10, 2007, Slaughter participated in the 15th Anniversary Battle Royal. On March 31, 2008, on an episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Slaughter paid tribute to longtime friend Ric Flair at the end of the show. He appeared on &quot;Raw&quot;&#x27;s 800th episode in Kung Fu Naki&#x27;s dance-off and also made an appearance in the Slammy Awards.

Slaughter, who had been working as a producer for WWE for the past several years, was released from his backstage producer duties with the company on January 13, 2009.

===Independent circuit (1994–2014)===
His first appearance on the independent circuit was at American Wrestling Federation in 1994 until the promotion closed down in October 1996. Following his 1997 signing with WWF, was for the World Wrestling Alliance (WWA) in a tag team match with George &quot;The Animal&quot; Steele in 1998. After that, he would only wrestle for WWF/WWE until making two appearances for the WWA in 2003. He started slowing down starting in 2006, wrestling only a few matches a year. On March 28, 2009, he defeated his former rival Kamala at IWC Night of Legends in Franklin, Pennsylvania. To finish off his career he had one match in 2013 and two matches in 2014, all tag team encounters. His last two matches were for Northeast Wrestling (NEW), who he had competed for in the past. His last match was teaming with Jeff Starr as they defeated Dalton Castle and Jake Manning on March 29, 2014.

===Fourth return to WWE (2009–present)===

He was the special guest host on &quot;Raw&quot; on August 10, 2009, where he made fun of Canadians and saying how the USA is the greatest country in the world. He made an appearance on the &quot;Decade of SmackDown&quot; on October 2, 2009, where he had an altercation with the Iron Sheik about which country was the greatest, USA or Iran. Slaughter would appear on November 15, 2010&#x27;s Old School RAW losing to Alberto Del Rio in one minute and 53 seconds. Then on June 27, 2011&#x27;s Raw edition he lost to Jack Swagger in 68 seconds. On July 3, 2012, Slaughter appeared on Smackdown teaming with Jim Duggan and Santino Marella defeating Drew McIntyre, Hunico and Camacho for the Great American Bash. He later appeared on December 31, 2012, edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, where he was challenged by then-United States Champion Antonio Cesaro in a match for the WWE United States Championship. He lost the match and failed to capture the title. This would be his final match for WWE. He then made an appearance on Old School RAW, serving as the special guest referee for The Great Khali vs Damien Sandow match after he got the most votes.

Slaughter made an appearance on November 24, 2014, edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, where he confronted United States Champion Rusev and his valet, Lana, and attempted to force Lana and Rusev to recite the Pledge of Allegiance (with the alternative, per an edict from Daniel Bryan, who was running the show that night, being that he would be forced to defend his title against the entire &quot;Raw&quot; roster). Rusev refused and had a staredown with Slaughter, who stood his ground. Jack Swagger and his manager, Zeb Colter, ran down to the ring and fended Rusev off. Swagger, Colter, and Slaughter then finished reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.
Slaughter returned at the &quot;Tribute to the Troops&quot; show on December 17, 2014, and helped Dean Ambrose beat Bray Wyatt by giving Dean his steel-toe boot to use on Wyatt.

Slaughter made a one-night appearance to WWE for the special &quot;Raw Reunion&quot; on July 22, 2019.

==G.I. Joe and other media==

Fictionalized versions of Sgt. Slaughter were part of the &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot; toyline, animated series and comic books, as a member of the &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; team and first appeared in the five-part TV episode entitled &quot;Arise, Serpentor, Arise!&quot; Along with the traditional merchandising of WWE superstars, Sgt. Slaughter is one of only a few real people to be produced as a &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; figure, (NFL football player William &quot;The Refrigerator&quot; Perry, pro-wrestler Roddy Piper, and astronaut Buzz Aldrin are some of the others), and even appeared in &quot;G.I. Joe: The Movie&quot;.

Slaughter also appeared twice as a special guest on &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot;, which starred fellow wrestler Captain Lou Albano. He appeared in the episodes &quot;All Steamed Up&quot; (in &quot;Butch Mario and the Luigi Kid&quot;) and &quot;Caught in a Draft&quot; (in &quot;Bad Rap&quot;).

A brief cross promotional stint in the late 1980s had Sgt. Slaughter and his &quot;battling battalion&quot; pitted against the Bigfoot Monster Truck in a tug-of-war challenge. It is featured on Blood, Sweat, &amp; Gears USHRA home video. This stunt was recently attempted again with Sgt. Slaughter using fans from the crowd at a Monster Truck show to tug-o-war with Bigfoot.

He was featured in the 1989 video game &quot;Sgt. Slaughter&#x27;s Mat Wars&quot; by Mindscape.

In the animated series &quot;Code Monkeys&quot;, Slaughter appeared as Sgt. Murder. He and Bulk Brogan (Hulk Hogan), &quot;Manly Man&quot; Ricky Ravage (Randy &quot;Macho Man&quot; Savage), and Sergei the Giant (André the Giant) were hired by a video game company to take on their rivals. His brother, Tommy Murder, was killed by &quot;The Black Shadow&quot;, who really was Black Steve, the company&#x27;s accountant.

He appeared on episode #3.6 of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Tosh.0&quot;, when he clotheslined Daniel Tosh and put David Wills (a.k.a. YouTube&#x27;s &quot;Crying Wrestling Fan&quot;) in a Cobra Clutch during Wills&#x27; &quot;Web Redemption&quot; segment.

In 2014, Sgt. Slaughter made a cameo appearance in the RadioShack Super Bowl XLVIII commercial &quot;The &#x27;80s Called&quot;.

He later voiced Dr. Military in the 2013 animated series &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; in a two-part episode called &quot;Teen Titans Vroom!&quot;

Slaughter voiced an adult-oriented version of himself in the animated WWE Network Exclusive show &quot;Camp WWE&quot;.

<text>A dehumidifier is an air conditioning device which reduces and maintains the level of humidity in the air. This is done usually for health or thermal comfort reasons or to eliminate musty odor and to prevent the growth of mildew by extracting water from the air. It can be used for household, commercial, or industrial applications. Large dehumidifiers are used in commercial buildings such as indoor ice rinks and swimming pools, as well as manufacturing plants or storage warehouses. Typical air conditioning systems combine dehumidification with cooling, by operating cooling coils below the dewpoint and draining away the water that condenses.

Dehumidifiers extract water from air that passes through the unit. There are two common types of dehumidifiers: condensate dehumidifiers and desiccant dehumidifiers, and there are also other emerging designs.

Condensate dehumidifiers use a refrigeration cycle to collect water known as condensate, which is normally considered to be greywater but may at times be reused for industrial purposes. Some manufacturers offer reverse osmosis filters to turn the condensate into potable water.

Desiccant dehumidifiers (known also as absorption dehumidifiers) bond moisture with hydrophilic materials such as silica gel. Cheap domestic units contain single-use hydrophilic substance cartridges, gel, or powder. Larger commercial units regenerate the sorbent by using hot air to remove moisture and expel humid air outside the room.

An emerging class of membrane dehumidifiers, such as the ionic membrane dehumidifier, dispose of water as a vapor rather than liquid. These newer technologies may aim to address smaller system sizes or reach superior performance. 

The energy efficiency of dehumidifiers can vary widely.

==History==
The first dehumidifier was created by American inventor Willis Carrier in 1902 to dehumidify a Brooklyn printing plant. Carrier cited the discovery as later motivating further discoveries in air conditioning. These &quot;active&quot; dehumidifiers condensed water from air. However, &quot;passive&quot; humidity control, such as increased natural ventilation, has been used since ancient times.

==Types==

=== Thermal condensation dehumidification ===
These methods rely on drawing air across a cold surface. Since the saturation vapor pressure of water decreases with decreasing temperature, the water in the air condenses on the surface, separating the water from the air.

==== Refrigeration (electric) ====
Electric refrigeration dehumidifiers are the most common type of dehumidifiers. They work by drawing moist air over a refrigerated evaporator with a fan. There are 3 main types of evaporators. They are coiled tube, fin and tube, and microchannel technology.

The cold evaporator coil of the refrigeration device condenses the water, which is removed, and then the air is reheated by the condenser coil. The now dehumidified, re-warmed air is released into the room. This process works most effectively at higher ambient temperatures with a high dew point temperature. In cold climates, the process is less effective. Highest efficiency is reached above and 45% relative humidity. This relative humidity value is higher if the temperature of the air is lower.

This type of dehumidifier differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the &quot;same&quot; room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually &quot;heated&quot;, just as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.

In addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the latent heat of vaporization). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an evaporative cooler, and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier will always warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity more directly, by condensing and removing water.

Warm, moist air is drawn into the unit at A in the diagram above. This air passes into a crossflow plate heat exchanger (B) where a substantial proportion of the sensible heat is transferred to a cool supply air stream. This process brings the extracted air close to saturation. The air then passes to the plenum chamber of the extract fan (C) where a portion of it may be rejected to outside. The amount that is rejected can be varied and is
determined either by legislation on fresh air requirements, or by the requirement to maintain a fresh, odour free environment. The balance of the air then passes into the evaporator coil of the heat pump where it is cooled and the moisture is condensed. This process yields substantial amounts of latent energy to the refrigeration circuit. Fresh air is then introduced to replace the amount that was extracted and the mix is discharged by the supply fan (G) to the crossflow plate exchanger (B) where it is heated by the extract air from the pool. This pre-warmed air then passes through the heat pump condenser (F) where it is heated by the latent energy removed during the condensation process as well as the energy input to the compressor. The warm dry air is then discharged to the room.

==== Conventional air conditioners ====
A conventional air conditioner is very similar to an electric dehumidifier and inherently acts as a dehumidifier when chilling the air. In an air conditioner, however, the air passes over the cold evaporator coils and then directly into the room. It is not re-heated by passing over the condenser, as in a refrigeration dehumidifier. Instead, the refrigerant is pumped by the compressor to a condenser which is located outside the room to be conditioned, and the heat is then released to the outside air. Conventional air conditioners use additional energy exhausting air outside, and new air can have more moisture than the room needs, such as a pool room that already holds a high amount of moisture in the air.

The water that condenses on the evaporator in an air conditioner is usually routed to remove extracted water from the conditioned space. Newer high-efficiency window units use the condensed water to help cool the condenser coil by evaporating the water into the outdoor air, while older units simply allowed the water to drip outside.

==== Spray dehumidifiers ====
When water is chilled below the atmospheric dew point, atmospheric water will condense onto it faster than water evaporates from it. Spray dehumidifiers mix sprays of chilled water and air to capture atmospheric moisture. They also capture pollutants and contaminants like pollen, for which purpose they are sometimes called &quot;air washers&quot;.

==== Makeshift dehumidifiers ====
Because window air conditioner units have condensers and expansion units, some of them can be used as makeshift dehumidifiers by sending their heat exhaust back into the same room as the cooled air, instead of the outside environment. If the condensate from the cooling coils is drained away from the room as it drips off the cooling coils, the result will be room air that is drier but slightly warmer.

However, many window air conditioners are designed to dispose of condensate water by re-evaporating it into the exhaust air stream, which cancels out the air humidity decrease caused by the condensation of moisture on the cooling coils. To be effective as a dehumidifier, an air conditioner must be designed or modified so that most or all of the water that condenses is drained away in liquid form, rather than re-evaporated. Even if condensate is drained, a modified air conditioner is still less efficient than a single-purpose appliance with a design optimized for dehumidification. Dehumidifiers are designed to pass air directly over the cooling coils and then the heating coils in a single efficient pass through the device.

In addition, most air conditioners are controlled by a thermostat which senses temperature, rather than a humidistat that senses humidity and is typically used to control a dehumidifier. A thermostat is not designed for the control of humidity, and controls it poorly if at all.

==== Ice buildup ====
Under certain conditions of temperature and humidity, ice can form on a refrigeration dehumidifier&#x27;s evaporator coils. The ice buildup can impede airflow and eventually form a solid block encasing the coils. This buildup prevents the dehumidifier from operating effectively, and can cause water damage if condensed water drips off the accumulated ice and not into the collection tray. In extreme cases, the ice can deform or distort mechanical elements, causing permanent damage.

Better-quality dehumidifiers may have a frost or ice sensor. These will turn off the machine and allow the ice-covered coils to warm and defrost. Once defrosted, the machine usually will automatically restart. Most ice sensors are simple thermal switches and do not directly sense the presence or absence of ice buildup. An alternative design senses the impeded airflow and shuts off the cooling coils in a similar manner.

Certain malfunctions of dehumidifiers, such as partial loss of refrigerant, can cause repeated icing of the coils. This condition requires repair or replacement of the equipment.

==== Thermoelectric dehumidifiers ====
Thermoelectric dehumidifiers use a Peltier heat pump to cool a surface and condense water vapor from the air. The design is simpler and has the benefit of being quieter compared to a dehumidifier with a mechanical compressor. However, because of its relatively poor Coefficient of Performance, this design is mainly used for small dehumidifiers. Ice buildup may be a problem, similar to problems with refrigeration dehumidifiers.

=== Absorption/desiccant dehumidification ===
This process uses a desiccant (humidity-absorbing material) to absorb moisture. The saturated material is then moved and the collected moisture is discharged, typically via heating.

Dehumidifiers that work according to the absorption principle are well-suited for high humidity at low temperatures. They are often used in industry to achieve humidity levels below 35%.

Because of the absence of compressor parts, desiccant dehumidifiers are often lighter and quieter than compressor dehumidifiers. Desiccant dehumidifiers can operate at lower temperatures as the unit does not need cooled coils.

Initial installation costs have limited the acceptance of desiccant dehumidification, worsened by lack of understanding of operational benefits, lack of technology awareness, and company priorities.

=== Membrane dehumidification ===
Several approaches can remove water vapor by flowing air past a membrane that allows vapor to enter. Dehumidification with membranes can allow for water vapor removal without condensation; this avoids the energy required with the enthalpy of vaporization, offering high efficiency for well-designed systems. Such dehumidification can be done passively with a rejected air stream; see Energy recovery ventilation. Active systems can use pressure gradients or electrocatalytic approaches.

==== Selective membrane dehumidification ====
Selective membranes use materials that block other ambient gases besides water vapor. Water vapor will then diffuse through these membranes under a concentration difference. Such a difference in concentration (partial pressure) can be caused by vacuum pumping, or simply passing by an airstream with a lower concentration of water. The most efficient configurations save energy by using two membranes that isolate a vacuum pump from ambient air. This dramatically reduces the pressure across the vacuum pump, saving energy. While such systems are often termed &quot;Isothermal Membrane Dehumidification,&quot; recent research has shown that these systems can be made more efficient by combining them with heat exchange. Such integration can improve performance by improving the vapor compression cycle&#x27;s COP (by operating between closer temperatures), and enhancing air mixing near the membrane.

Selective membranes can be made by immobilizing a liquid that can absorb water (or another solute) within a membranes, dubbed &quot;supported liquid membranes&quot;. Typically, there are two layer types; a highly porous membrane that contains the absorbing liquid, and a trapping layer that prevents the liquid from escaping. This liquid absorbing layer allows them to behave like selective membranes, without having a solid selective materials or very small pores. The liquids within which absorbs water well (hygroscopic) may include glycol mixtures or ionic liquids.

==== Ionic membrane dehumidification ====
An ionic membrane can be used to move humidity into or out of a sealed enclosure, using chemical reactions rather than condensation or selective materials. These systems use electrodes and proton-conducting membranes to remove water vapor by electrolysis. At the anode, is split into protons, , and electrons, where the protons travel through a material and react with ambient oxygen on the other side to create water again.

Perhaps the first materials for such electrolysis-based dehumidification were solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) membranes. This approach provides a low power, steady-state dehumidifier for enclosed areas where long-term maintenance is difficult. This electrolytic process delivers dehumidifying capacities ranging from 0.2 grams/day from a 0.2 m³ (7 cu ft) space to 58 grams/day from an 8m³ (280 cu ft). SPE systems generally do not have high dehydration capacities, but because the water vapor is removed through electrolysis, the process is maintenance-free. The process also uses very little electrical energy to operate, requiring no moving parts, making the ionic membranes silent in operation and very reliable over long periods of time. SPE dehumidifiers are typically used to protect sensitive electrical components, medical equipment, museum specimens, or scientific apparatus from humid environments.

The SPE consists of a proton-conductive solid polymer electrolyte and porous electrodes with a catalytic layer composed of noble metal particles. When a voltage is applied to the porous electrode attached to the membrane, the moisture on the anode side (dehumidifying side) dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and oxygen. The hydrogen ions migrate through membrane to be discharged on the cathode (moisture discharging) side where they react with oxygen in the air, resulting in water molecules (vapor), being discharged. Oxygen is released from the dehumidifying side, and if a large amount of water has been introduced to an airtight enclosure then oxygen can build up inside the enclosure.

==Condensate==

Not all dehumidifiers collect condensate; for example, many desiccant types discharge an airflow from the heated desiccant which contains water-saturated air. This can either be recondensed and collected as condensate, or expelled outside. Also, some air conditioner types spray any collected condensate onto the exterior condenser coils to cool it by evaporation, improving overall efficiency.

===Disposal===
Products using condensation technology have traditionally used a cold surface where humidity in warm air is condensed. Today, warm condensation technology, based on the concept of over-saturated steam inside a closed environment, makes it possible to dehumidify air at sub-zero temperatures. This is a very energy-efficient technology and equally efficient in all temperatures.

Most portable dehumidifiers are equipped with a condensate collection receptacle, typically with a float sensor that detects when the collection vessel is full, to shut off the dehumidifier and prevent an overflow of collected water. In a warm humid environment, these buckets will generally fill with water in 8–12 hours, and may need to be manually emptied and replaced several times per day to ensure continued operation.

Many portable dehumidifiers can also be adapted to connect the condensate drip output directly to a drain via a hose. Some dehumidifier models can tie into plumbing drains or use a built-in water pump to empty themselves as they collect moisture. Alternatively, a separate condensate pump may be used to move collected water to a disposal location, when gravity drainage is not possible.

Central air conditioning units typically need to be connected to a drain, because frequent manual emptying of multiple containers of condensate water extracted by such systems is impractical. If the condensate water is directed into the sewer system, it should be suitably trapped to prevent septic odors and sewer gases from entering the building. The condensate should not be directed into a septic system of a house, because it does not need special treatment as effluent. When the height of the air handler (containing the evaporator) is above the level of the surface drains used for rainwater, the condensate drain lines can often be routed into them. Air handlers located below grade level, e.g. the basement of a house, may need to use a condensate pump to lift the water to a surface drain.

===Potability===
Generally, dehumidifier water is considered a rather clean kind of greywater: not suitable for drinking, but acceptable for watering plants, though not garden vegetables. The health concerns are:
*The water contains trace metals from the heat exchanger, such as copper and aluminum, or zinc from galvanized steel supporting the frame and drain pan. Condensate would only be exposed to tin-lead solder in copper drain pipe, but the lead content is particularly dangerous. Trace metals may pose a danger if used on edible plants, as they can bioaccumulate. However, the water is considered usable for irrigation of ornamental plants and lawns.
*Various pathogens, including fungal spores, may accumulate in the water, particularly due to its stagnancy. Unlike in distilled water production, the water is not boiled, which would kill pathogens (including bacteria).
*As with distilled water, beneficial minerals are largely absent.

Food-grade dehumidifiers, also called atmospheric water generators, are specifically designed to avoid toxic metal contamination and to keep all water contact surfaces clean. The devices are primarily intended to produce pure water, and the dehumidifying effect is viewed as secondary to their operation.

==Maintenance==
If condensate water is handled automatically, most dehumidifiers require very little maintenance. Because of the volume of airflow through the appliance, dust buildup needs to be removed so it does not impede airflow; many designs feature removable and washable air filters. Condensate collection trays and containers may need occasional cleaning to remove debris buildup and prevent clogging of drainage passages, which can cause water leakage and overflow; if large amounts of certain particulates or dust are collected, then this may need to be performed frequently to avoid microbial growth.

==Applications==

Relative humidity in dwellings should preferably range from 30% to 50%.

===Homes and offices===

Dehumidification within buildings can control:
*excessive body perspiration buildup that cannot evaporate in moisture-saturated air
*condensation dripping from cold-water pipes
*warping and sticking of furniture and doors
*mold and mildew, which can cause fabrics, books, and furnishings to develop mustiness
*clothes moths, fleas, cockroaches, silverfish, woodlice, millipedes, and dust mites, which thrive in damp conditions (basements, crawl spaces, kitchens, bedrooms, bathrooms, spas or indoor pool areas, warehouses, workshops)

===Construction===
Dehumidifiers are also used in construction areas and renovations of indoor space to remove excess humidity or mildew.

===Industrial processes===
Dehumidifiers are used in industrial climatic chambers, to reduce relative humidity and the dew point in many industrial applications from waste and fresh water treatment plants to indoor grow rooms where the control of moisture is essential.

==Market size==
According to a 2015 estimate, the projected annual global total addressable market of dehumidifiers was about $3.5 billion by 2022. This includes various types and applications, encompassing different applications such as household and industrial and different technologies such as ventilating and desiccant.

<doc id="251978" wikidata="Q258915" url="?curid=251978" title="Renin">
<text>Renin (etymology and pronunciation), also known as an angiotensinogenase, is an aspartic protease protein and enzyme secreted by the kidneys that participates in the body&#x27;s renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)—also known as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis—that increases the volume of extracellular fluid (blood plasma, lymph, and interstitial fluid) and causes arterial vasoconstriction. Thus, it increases the body&#x27;s mean arterial blood pressure.

Renin is not commonly referred to as a hormone, although it has a receptor, the (pro)renin receptor, also known as the renin receptor and prorenin receptor (see also below), as well as enzymatic activity with which it hydrolyzes angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.

== Biochemistry and physiology ==
===Structure===
The primary structure of renin precursor consists of 406 amino acids with a pre- and a pro-segment carrying 20 and 46 amino acids, respectively. Mature renin contains 340 amino acids and has a mass of 37 kDa.

=== Secretion ===
The enzyme renin is secreted by pericytes in the vicinity of the afferent arterioles and similar microvessels of the kidney from specialized cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus—the juxtaglomerular cells, in response to three stimuli:
# A decrease in arterial blood pressure (that could be related to a decrease in blood volume) as detected by baroreceptors (pressure-sensitive cells). This is the most direct causal link between blood pressure and renin secretion (the other two methods operate via longer pathways).
# A decrease in sodium load delivered to the distal tubule. This load is measured by the macula densa of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.
# Sympathetic nervous system activity, which also controls blood pressure, acting through the β1 adrenergic receptors.

Human renin is secreted by at least 2 cellular pathways: a constitutive pathway for the secretion of the precursor prorenin and a regulated pathway for the secretion of mature renin.

===Renin–angiotensin system===

The renin enzyme circulates in the bloodstream and hydrolyzes (breaks down) angiotensinogen secreted from the liver into the peptide angiotensin I.

Angiotensin I is further cleaved in the lungs by endothelial-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) into angiotensin II, the most vasoactive peptide. Angiotensin II is a potent constrictor of all blood vessels. It acts on the smooth muscle and, therefore, raises the resistance posed by these arteries to the heart, and so for the same cardiac output, the blood pressure will rise. Angiotensin II also acts on the adrenal glands and releases aldosterone, which stimulates the epithelial cells in the distal tubule and collecting ducts of the kidneys to increase re-absorption of sodium, exchanging with potassium to maintain electrochemical neutrality, and water, leading to raised blood volume and raised blood pressure. The RAS also acts on the CNS to increase water intake by stimulating thirst, as well as conserving blood volume, by reducing urinary loss through the secretion of vasopressin from the posterior pituitary gland.

The normal concentration of renin in adult human plasma is 1.98–24.6 ng/L in the upright position.

== Function ==
Renin activates the renin–angiotensin system by using its endopeptidase activity to cleave the peptide bonds between leucine and valine residues in angiotensinogen, produced by the liver, to yield angiotensin I, which is further converted into angiotensin II by ACE, the angiotensin–converting enzyme primarily within the capillaries of the lungs. Angiotensin II then constricts blood vessels, increases the secretion of ADH and aldosterone, and stimulates the hypothalamus to activate the thirst reflex, each leading to an increase in blood pressure. Renin&#x27;s primary function is therefore to eventually cause an increase in blood pressure, leading to restoration of perfusion pressure in the kidneys.

Renin is secreted from juxtaglomerular kidney cells, which sense changes in renal perfusion pressure, via stretch receptors in the vascular walls. The juxtaglomerular cells are also stimulated to release renin by signaling from the macula densa. The macula densa senses changes in sodium delivery to the distal tubule, and responds to a drop in tubular sodium load by stimulating renin release in the juxtaglomerular cells. Together, the macula densa and juxtaglomerular cells comprise the juxtaglomerular complex.

Renin secretion is also stimulated by sympathetic nervous stimulation, mainly through β1 adrenoreceptor activation.

The (pro)renin receptor to which renin and prorenin bind is encoded by the gene ATP6ap2, ATPase H(+)-transporting lysosomal accessory protein 2, which results in a fourfold increase in the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I over that shown by soluble renin as well as non-hydrolytic activation of prorenin via a conformational change in prorenin which exposes the catalytic site to angiotensinogen substrate. In addition, renin and prorenin binding results in phosphorylation of serine and tyrosine residues of ATP6AP2.

The level of renin mRNA appears to be modulated by the binding of HADHB, HuR and CP1 to a regulatory region in the 3&#x27; UTR.

== Genetics ==

The gene for renin, &quot;REN&quot;, spans 12 kb of DNA and contains 8 introns. It produces several mRNA that encode different REN isoforms.

Mutations in the &quot;REN&quot; gene can be inherited, and are a cause of a rare inherited kidney disease, so far found to be present in only 2 families. This disease is autosomal dominant, meaning that it is characterized by a 50% chance of inheritance and is a slowly progressive chronic kidney disease that leads to the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation. Many—but not all—patients and families with this disease have an elevation in serum potassium and unexplained anemia relatively early in life. Patients with a mutation in this gene can have a variable rate of loss of kidney function, with some individuals going on dialysis in their 40s while others may not go on dialysis until into their 70s. This is a rare inherited kidney disease that exists in less than 1% of people with kidney disease.

== Clinical applications ==
An over-active renin-angiotensin system leads to vasoconstriction and retention of sodium and water. These effects lead to hypertension. Therefore, renin inhibitors can be used for the treatment of hypertension. This is measured by the plasma renin activity (PRA).

In current medical practice, the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system&#x27;s overactivity (and resultant hypertension) is more commonly reduced using either ACE inhibitors (such as ramipril and perindopril) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs, such as losartan, irbesartan or candesartan) rather than a direct oral renin inhibitor. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are also part of the standard treatment after a heart attack.

The differential diagnosis of kidney cancer in a young patient with hypertension includes juxtaglomerular cell tumor (reninoma), Wilms&#x27; tumor, and renal cell carcinoma, all of which may produce renin.

=== Measurement ===

Renin is usually measured as the plasma renin activity (&quot;PRA&quot;). PRA is measured specially in case of certain diseases that present with hypertension or hypotension. PRA is also raised in certain tumors. A PRA measurement may be compared to a plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) as a &quot;PAC/PRA ratio&quot;.

==Discovery and naming==
The name &quot;renin&quot; = &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, &quot;kidney&quot; + &quot;compound&quot;. The most common pronunciation in English is (long &quot;e&quot;); (short &quot;e&quot;) is also common, but using allows one to reserve for &quot;rennin&quot;. Renin was discovered, characterized, and named in 1898 by Robert Tigerstedt, Professor of Physiology, and his student, Per Bergman, at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.

<text>Alloces is a demon that appears in demonological grimoires such as the &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot;, and the &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;. He is described in the &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; (as the fifty-second spirit) and (as Allocer or Alocer) in the &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; (as the sixty-third spirit) as a duke, taking the form of a fire-breathing, lion-headed soldier riding a horse. His purported duties include teaching astronomy, and liberal sciences, and granting familiars. He is claimed to have 36 legions of demons under his command. In the &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot;, Alloces appears as Allogor or Algor, again a duke, but otherwise with a completely different appearance and abilities -- a spear-toting knight who answers questions, provides advice for plans, and commands only 30 legions of demons. In the duplicate entry, Alloces appears as Algor, ruled by the spirit &quot;Orience&quot; (Oriens), again as a knight who explains secrets, but with the additional power of garnering the favor of nobles. According to Rudd, Alloces is opposed by the Shemhamphorasch angel Imamiah.

== Popular Culture ==
Alloces is portrayed in the Japanese anime and manga series Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun as a lion-headed boy named Allocer Schneider.

Alloces in Romancing SaGa 3 is one of the Four Sinistrals who rule the Abyss, with him being the lord of Earth.

<doc id="251986" wikidata="Q1062789" url="?curid=251986" title="Congregationalism">
<text>Congregationalism (also Congregationalist churches or Congregational churches) is a Reformed (Calvinist) tradition of Protestant Christianity in which churches practice congregational government. Each independently and autonomously runs its own affairs. These principles are enshrined in the Cambridge Platform (1648) and the Savoy Declaration (1658), Congregationalist confessions of faith. The Congregationalist Churches are a continuity of the theological tradition upheld by the Puritans. Their genesis was through the work of Congregationalist divines Robert Browne, Henry Barrowe, and John Greenwood.

In the United Kingdom, the Puritan Reformation of the Church of England laid the foundation for these churches. In England, the early Congregationalists were called &quot;Separatists&quot; or &quot;Independents&quot; to distinguish them from the similarly Calvinistic Presbyterians, whose churches embrace a polity based on the governance of elders; this commitment to self-governing congregations was codified in the Savoy Declaration. Congregationalism in the United States traces its origins to the Puritans of New England, who wrote the Cambridge Platform of 1648 to describe the autonomy of the church and its association with others. Within the United States, the model of Congregational churches was carried by migrating settlers from New England into New York, then into the Old Northwest, and further.

The Congregationalist tradition has a presence in the United States, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Ireland, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and various island nations in the Pacific region. It has been introduced either by immigrant dissenters or by missionary organizations such as the London Missionary Society. A number of evangelical Congregational churches are members of the World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship. Congregationalism, as defined by the Pew Research Center, is estimated to represent 0.5 percent of the worldwide Protestant population.

==Beliefs==
Congregationalism is a Reformed (Calvinist) tradition of Protestant Christianity that enjoins a church polity in which congregations are self-governing (cf. congregational polity). Through the years, Congregationalists have adopted various confessional statements, including the Savoy Declaration, the Cambridge Platform and the Kansas City Statement of Faith.

Unlike Presbyterians, Congregationalists practise congregational polity (from which they derive their name), which holds that the members of a local church have the right to decide their church&#x27;s forms of worship and confessional statements, choose their own officers and administer their own affairs without any outside interference. Congregationalist polity is rooted in a foundational tenet of Congregationalism: the priesthood of all believers. According to Congregationalist minister Charles Edward Jefferson, this means that &quot;Every believer is a priest and ... every seeking child of God is given directly wisdom, guidance, power&quot;. Consequently, there is an absence of godparents, since the whole congregation is the godparent to all the children in the church.

Congregationalists have two sacraments: baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper. Congregationalists practise infant baptism, but hold that &quot;.. there is no distinction between &quot;infant baptism&quot; and &quot;believer&#x27;s baptism&quot;.&quot; The Lord&#x27;s Supper is normally celebrated once or twice a month. Congregationalists do not invoke the intercession of saints. Certain Congregationalist hymns that have become popular across Christendom include &quot;When I Survey the Wondrous Cross&quot; and &quot;Hark the Glad Sound&quot;.

== Origins ==


The origins of Congregationalism are found in 16th-century Puritanism, a movement that sought to complete the English Reformation begun with the separation of the Church of England from the Catholic Church during the reign of Henry VIII (1509–47). During the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603), the Church of England was considered a Reformed or Calvinist church, but it also preserved certain characteristics of medieval Catholicism, such as cathedrals, church choirs, a formal liturgy contained in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, traditional clerical vestments and episcopal polity (government by bishops).

The Puritans were Calvinists who wanted to further reform the church by abolishing all remaining Catholic practices, such as clerical vestments, wedding rings, organ music in church, kneeling at Holy Communion, using the term &quot;priest&quot; for a minister, bowing at the name of Jesus, and making the sign of the cross in baptism and communion. Many Puritans believed the Church of England should follow the example of Reformed churches in other parts of Europe and adopt presbyterian polity, in which an egalitarian network of local ministers cooperated through regional synods. Other Puritans experimented with congregational polity both within the Church of England and outside of it. Puritans who left the established church were known as Separatists.

Congregationalism may have first developed in the London Underground Church under Richard Fitz in the late 1560s and 1570s. The Congregational historian Albert Peel argued that it was accepted that the evidence for a fully thought out congregational ecclesiology is not overwhelming.

Robert Browne (1550–1633) was the first person to set out explicit congregational principles and is considered the founder of Congregationalism. While studying for ordination, Browne became convinced that the Church of England was a false church. He moved to Norwich and together with Robert Harrison formed an illegal Separatist congregation. 

In 1581, Browne and his followers moved to Holland in order to worship freely. While in Holland, Browne wrote treatises that laid out the essential features of Congregationalism. Browne argued for a church only of genuine, regenerate believers and criticized the Anglicans for including all English people within their church. The congregation should choose its own leaders, and the ministers should be ordained by the congregation itself not by bishops or fellow ministers. Each congregation should be founded on a written church covenant, and the congregation as a whole should govern the church: &quot;The meetings together… of every whole church, and of the elders therein, is above the apostle, above the prophet, the evangelist, the pastor, the teacher, and every particular elder&quot; and &quot;The voice of the whole people, guided by the elders and the forwardest, is said [in Scripture] to be the voice of God&quot;. While each church would be independent, separate churches would still come together to discuss matters of common concern.

Short lifespans were typical of Separatist churches (also known as Brownist congregations). These were small congregations who met in secret and faced persecution. They were often forced to go into exile in Holland and tended to disintegrate quickly. Notable Separatists who faced exile or death included Henry Barrow (–1593), John Greenwood (died 1593), John Penry (1559–1593), Francis Johnson (1563–1618), and Henry Ainsworth (1571–1622).

In the early 1600s, a Separatist congregation in Scrooby was founded through the efforts of John Smyth (who later rejected infant baptism and became a founder of the Baptist movement). John Robinson was the congregation&#x27;s pastor and William Brewster was an elder. In 1607, the congregation moved to Holland fleeing persecution. In 1620, the group (known in history as the Pilgrims) sailed to North America on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, establishing the Plymouth Colony and bringing the Congregational tradition to America.

In 1639 William Wroth, then Rector of the parish church at Llanvaches in Monmouthshire, established the first Independent Church in Wales &quot;according to the New England pattern&quot;, i.e. Congregational. The Tabernacle United Reformed Church at Llanvaches survives to this day.

During the English Civil War, those who supported the Parliamentary cause were invited by Parliament to discuss religious matters. The Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) was officially claimed to be the statement of faith for both the Church of England (Anglican/Episcopal) and Church of Scotland (Presbyterian), which was politically expedient for those in the Presbyterian dominated English Parliament who approved of the Solemn League and Covenant (1643).

After the Second Civil War, the New Model Army which was dominated by Congregationalists (or Independents) seized control of the parliament with Pride&#x27;s purge (1648), arranged for the trial and execution of Charles I in January 1649 and subsequently introduced a republican Commonwealth dominated by Independents such as Oliver Cromwell. This government lasted until 1660 when the monarch was restored and Episcopalism was re-established (see the Penal Laws and Great Ejection). 

In 1662, two years after the Restoration, two thousand Independent, Presbyterian, and congregational ministers were evicted from their parishes as dissenters and not being in Holy Orders conferred by bishops. 

In 1658 (during the interregnum) the Congregationalists created their own version of the Westminster Confession, called the Savoy Declaration, which remains the principal subordinate standard of Congregationalism.

== By country ==
=== Argentina ===
The mission to Argentina was the second foreign field tended by German Congregationalists. The work in South America began in 1921 when four Argentine churches urgently requested that denominational recognition be given to George Geier, serving them. The Illinois Conference licensed Geier, who worked among Germans from Russia who were very similar to their kin in the United States and in Canada. The South American Germans from Russia had learned about Congregationalism in letters from relatives in the United States.

In 1924 general missionary John Hoelzer, while in Argentina for a brief visit, organised six churches. In the province of Entre Ríos, congregations began to join the Evangelical Congregational Church in Crespo. Information indicates that since 1923 there were activities in private homes and in 1928 the first pastoral house was inaugurated, in San Salvador from 1928, in Concordia, from 1929–1930, in Federal from 1934, in Paraná since the 1940&#x27;s. In Concepción del Uruguay since 1942. Basavilbaso from 1944. Gualeguaychú from 1950. And then many more followed.
In the province of Chaco, immigrants from Germany, Russia and neighbouring areas settled in Colonia Palmar, between Charata and General Pinedo. When they heard about the existence of the Evangelical Congregational Church, they contacted and invited the North American missionary Guillermo Strauch to visit them. This took place on August 25, 1928, when the first service was held and as a result of the meeting they decided to join the I. E. C. The following year, their first church was inaugurated. Due to a great drought, in 1945 this church had to close its doors, and the families emigrated to Villa Ángela, Coronel Du Graty or Santa Sylvina, in the province of Chaco, or to El Colorado, in Formosa. In each of these places, new faith communities emerged from the relocation of members of Colonia Palmar. In Villa Ángela, the first church was actually established in Colonia Juan José Paso in 1947, and two years later the first church was inaugurated. In Coronel Du Graty, it originated from prayer meetings in 1947 (with those who came from Colonia Palmar) in &quot;Campo Ugarte&quot; and &quot;Campo Ñandubay&quot;. Later they joined together to build their own place for worship, which happened in 1954. In the province of Misiones, in Leandro N. Alem and the surrounding area, immigrants from Poland, Germany and Brazil began to arrive between 1929 and 1938. Although their economic condition was precarious, they were rich in their desire to work, to progress and in their spirituality. They began to hold prayer meetings, and faith communities were formed in Alem Sud, Picada Almafuerte and Picada Flor (Colonia El Chatón).

In 1932 a group of these believers adopted the name of &quot;Congregation of Evangelical Brothers&quot; and when they began the process of registration in the National Register of Cults, they became aware of the Evangelical Congregational Church, decided to join it, and in 1935 the North American missionary, Pastor Federico Gross visited them for an Extraordinary Assembly, where they approved their statutes with the name of &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Congregational Church&quot;. This consolidated their union with the IEC of Argentina. In other cities of Misiones the Congregational work began in Oberá in the 1930s, in San Francisco de Asís a work began with believers from Brazil in 1935, in Dos de Mayo since 1945, in Valle Hermoso a group of Lutheran origin joined the Evangelical Congregational Church in 1949, in El Soberbio since 1950, in San Vicente since 1966, in Posadas since 1970 and later many more congregations.

In Buenos Aires, as a result of the migration of congregational members from the interior of the country, it was started in Rivadavia 6001 in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, in 1937 by the missionary Federico Gross. From that moment on they received pastoral care from Entre Ríos. In 1946 the missionary Otto Tiede organised the first board of directors in the Colegiales neighbourhood, when the congregation met in the church &quot;El Buen Pastor&quot;, which was lent to them by the Disciples of Christ. In 1947, Pastor Ludwig Serfas became the first local pastor, with residence in Olivos, and it was decided to build the first church in Villa Ballester, which was inaugurated in 1950.

The Evangelical Congregational Church spread to Córdoba in 1972, with itinerant missionary work from Basavilbaso (Entre Ríos). In the province of Santa Fe from 1980, from Paraná (Entre Ríos). In Corrientes (capital) from 1982 and in CABA a missionary work started in 1995. In the first 100 years, it has spread from Entre Ríos to several provinces: Misiones, Corrientes, Chaco, Formosa, Córdoba, Santa Fe, Buenos Aires and CABA. It has spread to southern Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. It is currently present in more than 150 towns and cities in Argentina.

It has a social commitment, working among the most vulnerable, deprived and marginalised. It serves in the containment of families in the most varied contexts. With specific programmes for children, adolescents, young people, married couples and the elderly. With presence in formal and informal education, training and instructing people of all ages, in arts and crafts, in values and principles that make solidarity, human rights, and a better quality of life for all, according to the possibilities and opportunities. With canteens and picnic areas, with an integral pastoral care, which includes accompaniment in hospitals and prisons. It has a Higher Biblical Institute that offers an official degree: &quot;Profesorado en Ciencias Sagradas&quot;.

=== Australia ===

In 1977, most congregations of the Congregational Union of Australia merged with all Churches of the Methodist Church of Australasia and a majority of Churches of the Presbyterian Church of Australia to form the Uniting Church in Australia.

Those congregations that did not join the Uniting Church formed the Fellowship of Congregational Churches or continued as Presbyterians. Some more ecumenically minded Congregationalists left the Fellowship of Congregational Churches in 1995 and formed the Congregational Federation of Australia.

===Bulgaria ===

Congregationalists (called &quot;Evangelicals&quot; in Bulgaria; the word &quot;Protestant&quot; is not used) were among the first Protestant missionaries to the Ottoman Empire and to the Northwestern part of the European Ottoman Empire which is now Bulgaria, where their work to convert these Orthodox Christians was unhampered by the death penalty imposed by the Ottomans on Muslim converts to Christianity. These missionaries were significant contributors to the Bulgarian National Revival movement. Today, Protestantism in Bulgaria represents the third largest religious group, behind Orthodox and Muslim. Missionaries from the United States first arrived in 1857–58, sent to Istanbul by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). The ABCFM was proposed in 1810 by the Congregationalist graduates of Williams College, MA, and was chartered in 1812 to support missions by Congregationalists, Presbyterian (1812–1870), Dutch-Reformed (1819–1857) and other denominational members. The ABCFM focused its efforts on southern Bulgaria and the Methodist Church on the region north of the Balkan Mountains (Stara Planina, or &quot;Old Mountains&quot;).

In 1857, Cyrus Hamlin and Charles Morse established three missionary centres in southern Bulgaria – in Odrin (Edirne, former capital city of the Ottoman Empire, in Turkey), Plovdiv and Stara Zagora. They were joined in 1859 by Russian-born naturalized America Frederic Flocken in 1859. American Presbyterian minister Elias Riggs commissioned, supported and edited the work of Bulgarian monk Neofit Rilski to create a Bible translations into Bulgarian which was then distributed widely in Bulgaria in 1871 and thereafter. This effort was supported by Congregationalist missionary Albert Long, Konstantin Fotinov, Hristodul Sechan-Nikolov and Petko Slaveikov. Reportedly, 2,000 copies of the newly translated Bulgarian language New Testament were sold within the first two weeks.

Congregational churches were established in Bansko, Veliko Turnovo, and Svishtov between 1840 and 1878, followed by Sofia in 1899. By 1909, there were 19 Congregational churches, with a total congregation of 1,456 in southern Bulgaria offering normal Sunday services, Sunday schools for children, biblical instruction for adults; as well as women&#x27;s groups and youth groups. Summer Bible schools were held annually from 1896 to 1948.

Congregationalists led by James F. Clarke opened Bulgaria&#x27;s first Protestant primary school for boys in Plovdiv in 1860, followed three years later by a primary school for girls in Stara Zagora. In 1871 the two schools were moved to Samokov and merged as the American College, now considered the oldest American educational institution outside the US. In 1928, new facilities were constructed in Sofia, and the Samokov operation transferred to the American College of Sofia (ACS), now operated at a very high level by the Sofia American Schools, Inc.

In 1874, a Bible College was opened in Ruse, Bulgaria for people wanting to become pastors. At the 1876 annual conference of missionaries, the beginning of organizational activity in the country was established. The evangelical churches of Bulgaria formed a united association in 1909.

The missionaries played a significant role in assisting the Bulgarians throw off &quot;the Turkish Yoke&quot;, which included publishing the magazine Zornitsa (Зорница, &quot;Dawn&quot;), founded in 1864 by the initiative of Riggs and Long. Zornitsa became the most powerful and most widespread newspaper of the Bulgarian Renaissance. A small roadside marker on Bulgarian Highway 19 in the Rila Mountains, close to Gradevo commemorates the support given the Bulgarian Resistance by these early Congregationalist missionaries.

On 3 September 1901 Congregationalist missionaries came to world attention in the Miss Stone Affair when missionary Ellen Maria Stone, of Roxbury, Massachusetts, and her pregnant fellow missionary friend Macedonian-Bulgarian Katerina Stefanova–Tsilka, wife of an Albanian Protestant minister, were kidnapped while traveling between Bansko and Gorna Dzhumaya (now Blagoevgrad), by an Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization detachment led by the voivoda Yane Sandanski and the sub-voivodas Hristo Chernopeev and Krǎstyo Asenov and ransomed to provide funds for revolutionary activities. Eventually, a heavy ransom (14,000 Ottoman lira (about US$62,000 at 1902 gold prices or $5 million at 2012 gold prices) raised by public subscription in the USA was paid on 18 January 1902 in Bansko and the hostages (now including a newborn baby) were released on 2 February near Strumica—a full five months after being kidnapped. Widely covered by the media at the time, the event has been often dubbed &quot;America&#x27;s first modern hostage crisis&quot;.

The Bulgarian royal house, of Catholic German extraction, was unsympathetic to the American inspired Protestants, and this mood became worse when Bulgaria sided with Germany in WWI and WWII. Matters became much worse when the Bulgarian Communist Party took power in 1944. Like the royal family, it too saw Protestantism closely linked to the West and hence more politically dangerous than traditional Orthodox Christianity. This prompted repressive legislation in the form of &quot;Regulations for the Organization and Administration of the Evangelical Churches in the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria&quot; and resulted in the harshest government repression, possibly the worst in the entire Eastern Bloc, intended to extinguish Protestantism altogether. Mass arrests of pastors (and often their families), torture, long prison sentences (including four life sentences) and even disappearance were common. Similar tactics were used on parishioners. 

In fifteen highly publicized mock show-trials between 8 February and 8 March 1949, all the accused pastors confessed to a range of charges against them, including treason, spying (for both the US and Yugoslavia), black marketing, and various immoral acts. State appointed pastors were foisted on surviving congregations. As late as the 1980s, imprisonment and exile were still employed to destroy the remaining Protestant churches. The Congregationalist magazine &quot;Zornitsa&quot; was banned; Bibles became unobtainable. As a result, the number of Congregationalists is small and estimated by Paul Mojzes in 1982 to number about 5,000, in 20 churches. (Total Protestants in Bulgaria were estimated in 1965 to have been between 10,000 and 20,000.) More recent estimates indicate enrollment in Protestant (&quot;Evangelical&quot; or &quot;Gospel&quot;) churches of between 100,000 and 200,000, presumably reflecting the success of more recent missionary efforts of evangelical groups.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the first foreign field, thirty-one churches that had been affiliated with the General Conference became part of the United Church of Canada when that denomination was founded in 1925 by the merger of the Canadian Congregationalist and Methodist churches, and two-thirds of the congregations of the Presbyterian Church in Canada. In 1988, a number of UCC congregations separated from the national church, which they felt was moving away theologically and in practice from Biblical Christianity. Many of the former UCC congregations banded together as the new Congregational Christian Churches in Canada.

The Congregational Christian Churches in Canada (or 4Cs) is an evangelical, Protestant, Christian denomination, headquartered in Brantford, Ontario, and a member of the World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship. The name &quot;congregational&quot; generally describes its preferred organizational style, which promotes local church autonomy and ownership, while fostering fellowship and accountability between churches at the National level.

=== Ireland ===
The Congregational Union of Ireland was founded in 1829 and currently has around 26 member churches. In 1899 it absorbed the Irish Evangelical Society.

=== Samoa ===

The Congregational Christian Church of Samoa is one of the largest group of churches throughout the Pacific Region. It was founded in 1830 by the London Missionary Society missionary John Williams on the island of Savai&#x27;i in the village of Sapapali&#x27;i. As the church grew it established and continues to support theological colleges in Samoa and Fiji. There are over 100,000 members attending over 2,000 congregations throughout the world, most of which are located in Samoa, American Samoa, New Zealand, Australia and America. The Christian Congregational Church of Jamaica falls under the constitution of the Samoan Church.

=== South Africa ===
Congregational churches were brought to the Cape Colony by British settlers.
=== United Kingdom ===
The Congregational Union of England and Wales was established in 1831. It had no authority over the affiliated churches, but instead aimed to advise and support them.
In 1972, about three-quarters of English Congregational churches merged with the Presbyterian Church of England to form the United Reformed Church (URC). However, about 600 Congregational churches have continued in their historic independent tradition. Under the United Reformed Church Act 1972 (c. xviii), which dealt with the financial and property issues arising from the merger between what had become by then the Congregational Church of England and Wales and the Presbyterian Church of England, certain assets were divided between the various parties.
In England, there are three main groups of continuing Congregationalists. These are the Congregational Federation, which has offices in Nottingham and Manchester, the Evangelical Fellowship of Congregational Churches, which has offices in Beverley, and about 100 Congregational churches that are loosely federated with other congregations in the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches, or are unaffiliated. The unaffiliated churches&#x27; share of the assets of the Congregational Union/Church of England and Wales is administered by a registered charity, the Unaffiliated Congregational Churches Charities, which supports the unaffiliated churches and their retired ministers.

In 1981, the United Reformed Church merged with the re-formed Association of Churches of Christ and, in 2000, just over half of the churches in the Congregational Union of Scotland also joined the United Reformed Church (via the United Reformed Church Act 2000). The remainder of Congregational churches in Scotland joined the Congregational Federation.

Wales traditionally is the part which has the largest share of Congregationalists among the population, most Congregationalists being members of &quot;Undeb yr Annibynwyr Cymraeg&quot; (the Union of Welsh Independents), which is particularly important in Carmarthenshire and Brecknockshire.

The London Missionary Society was effectively the world mission arm of British Congregationalists, sponsoring missionaries including Eric Liddell and David Livingstone. After mergers and changes of name, the Society was succeeded in 1977 by the worldwide Council for World Mission.

=== United States ===

In the United States, the Congregational tradition traces its origins mainly to Puritan settlers of colonial New England. Congregational churches have had an important role in the political, religious and cultural history of the United States. Their practices concerning church governance influenced the early development of democratic institutions in New England, and some of the nation&#x27;s oldest educational institutions, such as Harvard and Yale University, were founded to train Congregational clergy. In the 21st century, the Congregational tradition is represented by the United Church of Christ, the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches, Conservative Congregational Christian Conference, the Evangelical Association and many unaffiliated local churches. Some congregations and denominations are conservative on social issues, (e.g. CCCC) while others are liberal (e.g. UCC).

<text>Alexandros Koumoundouros (; 4 February 1815 – 26 February 1883) was a Greek politician and founder of the Nationalist Party, who served as Prime Minister of Greece ten times, from 1865 to 1867, 1870 to 1871, and from 1875 to 1882. Born in Kampos, on the Messenian side of the Mani Peninsula, he was the son of Spyridon-Galanis Koumoundouros, the bey of the area during the last period of the administration of the region by the Ottoman Empire.

He was a political personality famous for his work towards national progress, despite him having been in office during a very unsettled period of Greek history, alongside his longtime political rival Charilaos Trikoupis. At the time of his death, he was the country&#x27;s longest serving Prime Minister in non-consecutive terms in office.

== Biography ==

After the Greek War of Independence, he moved to Nafplion where he went to school, then to Athens to study law. In 1841, he took part in the revolution in Crete despite believing it was a lost cause—the conditions were not right for such an undertaking at that time.

Koumoundouros’ long career encompassed many facets of political life, including serving in parliament, authoring of legislation, promotion of a democratic regime, restoration of the army, distribution of national farms to landless farmers, and the approval of major construction work (such as the Isthmus of Corinth). 

During his 50-year-long period of political involvement he tried to remain neutral, and to avoid confrontation both with the three Great Powers and with the smaller powers of that time. In this period he held various ministerial appointments eighteen times, was twice president of the Greek Parliament and ten times Prime Minister of Greece. Despite often experiencing inimical conditions, including at least three assassination attempts, he still managed to create a firm foundation for democracy in Greece. He served as prime minister of Greece a record ten times.

=== Early political career ===
He was appointed as Public Prosecutor in the Tribunal of Kalamata, but he soon quit this position in order to become a politician. His first political distinction emerged in 1853 when he was elected deputy of the province of Messinia (the province of Kalamàta). Two years later he became Speaker of the Hellenic Parliament, and the following year Minister of Economics.

He kept the same ministry in the new governments both of 1857 and 1859. After the overthrow of King Otto in 1862 he became Minister of Justice of the temporary government.

The first elections for a proper government after the fall of King Otto took place in 1863 and Koumoundouros remained as Minister of Justice, however, the extremely poor political stability lead to new elections the following year.

In the succeeding government of 1864, Koumoundouros was moved to the Ministry of Religion and Education and later to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

=== Tenure as Prime Minister ===
On 25 March 1865, he became Prime Minister of Greece for the first time and won the elections of 1866, too. Four years later, he retained the position of the Minister of Army and Internal Affairs, in addition to being Prime Minister. In 1875, Koumoundouros was successful in uniting all other parliamentary parties against Charilaos Trikoupis. In August 1875, he became President of the Parliament once again and in the elections of the same year he was made Prime Minister of the country once more.

Elections took place three times in 1876 and Koumoundouros was victorious in two of them. He also won the elections of 1878.

Koumoundouros’ greatest achievement came in 1881, during his last (tenth) premiership, when after the Congress of Berlin and after diplomatic contacts with the Ottomans, he managed to bring about the annexation of the areas of Thessaly and Arta to the Greek mainland (with the Convention of Constantinople).

Right after this achievement he called for new elections so that representatives of the newly annexed regions could enter Parliament. Despite this concession, the new candidates elected the representative of the opposition party as President of Parliament. As a result, Koumoundouros resigned on 3 March 1882. He died some months later on 26 February 1883, in his home on Ludwig Square (now known as Koumoundourou Square), in Athens, and was buried at public expense in the First Cemetery of Athens.

== Personal life ==
After the end of the unsuccessful Cretan revolution, he married Ekaterìni Konstantinou G. Mavromichàli of the famed Maniot family. They had two children. His first son Konstantìnos, was born in Kalamata 1846, and daughter Marìa, was born in Kalamata 1845. Ekaterìni died young and Koumoundouros married Efthimìa Perotì who presented him with his second son in 1858, Spirìdonas and in 1867 a daughter, Olga.

<text>A potion is a liquid &quot;that contains medicine, poison, or something that is supposed to have magic powers.&quot; It derives from the Latin word &quot;potio&quot; which refers to a drink or the act of drinking. The term philtre is also used, often specifically for a love potion, a potion that is supposed to create feelings of love or attraction in the one who drinks it.
Throughout history there have been several types of potions for a range of purposes. Reasons for taking potions ranged from curing an illness, to securing immortality to trying to induce love. These potions, while often ineffective or poisonous, occasionally had some degree of medicinal success depending on what they sought to fix and the type and amount of ingredients used. Some popular ingredients used in potions across history include Spanish fly, nightshade plants, cannabis, and opium.

During the 17th to 19th century, it was common in Europe to see peddlers offering potions for ailments ranging from heartbreak to the plague. These were eventually dismissed as quackery. Prostitutes, courtesans, enchanters and midwives were also known to distribute potions.

==Etymology==
The word potion has its origins in the Latin word &quot;potus&quot;, an irregular past participle of &quot;potare&quot;, meaning &quot;to drink&quot;. This evolved to the word &quot;potionem&quot; (nominative &quot;potio&quot;) meaning either &quot;a potion, a drinking&quot; or a &quot;poisonous draught, magic potion&quot;. In Ancient Greek, the word for both drugs and potions was &quot;pharmaka&quot; or &quot;pharmakon&quot;.
 In the 12th century, the French had the word &quot;pocion&quot;, meaning &quot;potion&quot;, &quot;draught&quot;, or &quot;medicine&quot;. By the 13th century, this word became &quot;pocioun&quot;, referring to either a medicinal drink, or a dose of liquid medicine (or poison).

The word &quot;potion&quot; is also cognate with the Spanish words &quot;pocion&quot; with the same meaning, and &quot;ponzoña&quot;, meaning &quot;poison&quot;; The word &quot;pozione&quot; was originally the same word for both &quot;poison&quot; and &quot;potion&quot; in Italian, but by the early 15th century in Italy, potion began to be known specifically as a magical or enchanted drink.

==Administrators of potions==
The practice of administering potions has had a long history of being illegalised. Despite these laws, there have been several different administrators of potions across history.

===Quacks===
Quacks or charlatans are people who sell &quot;medical methods that do not work and are only intended to make money&quot;. In Europe in the 15th century it was also common to see long-distance peddlers, who sold supposedly magical healing potions and elixirs. During the Great Plague of London in the 17th century, quacks sold many fake potions promising either cures or immunity. Because pills looked less trustworthy to the public, potions were often the top sellers of quacks. These potions often included bizarre ingredients such as floral pomanders and the smoke of fragrant woods. The well known Wessex quack Vilbert was known to sell love potions made of pigeon hearts.  By the 18th century in England, it was common for middle class households to stock potions that claimed to solve a variety of ailments. Quackery grew to its height in the 19th century.

===Pharmacists===
In 18th- and 19th-century Britain, pharmacies or apothecaries were often a cheaper, more accessible option for medical treatment than doctors. Potions distributed by chemists for illnesses were often derived from herbs and plants, and based on old beliefs and remedies.

Prior to the Pharmacy Act 1868 anybody could become a pharmacist or chemist. Since the practice was unregulated, potions were often made from scratch.

Potions were additionally used to cure illness in livestock. One potion found in a 19th-century pharmacist&#x27;s recipe book was to be used for &quot;lambs of about 7 years old&quot; and contains chalk, pomegranate and opium.

===The role of women in distributing potions===
There was a strict hierarchy in the medical community of Europe during the 12th to 15th centuries. Male doctors were the most respected and paid followed by female apothecaries, barber-surgeons and surgeons. Women were often the main way that individuals who could not afford doctors or apothecaries could gain medical treatment Potions, in addition to calming teas or soup, were a common homemade treatment made by women. When unable to go to a female house member, early modern people would often go to the wise women of their village. Wise women (who were often supposed witches) were knowledgeable in health care and could administer potions, lotions or salves in addition to performing prayers or chants. This was often free of charge or significantly less expensive than the potions of apothecaries.

The limited jobs available to women during the 17th to 18th century in Europe often involved a knowledge of potions as an additional way to gain a financial income. Jobs that often involved the selling of love potions included prostitutes, courtesans, enchanters and midwives. These practices varied by region. In Rome, up until the period of the civil wars, the only physicians were drug-sellers, enchanters and midwives. In Greece, retired courtesans often both created potions and worked as midwives. Prostitutes in Europe were often expected to be an expert in magic and administer love potions.

===Self-administration===
In the Middle Ages and the early modern period, using potions to induce sterility and abortion was widely practiced in Europe. The majority of abortive potions were made using emmenagogue herbs (herbs used to stimulate menstruation) which were intended to cause a period and end a pregnancy. Additionally abortive potions could also be prepared by infusion of a herb or tree. The willow tree was a common ingredient in these potions, as it was fabled to cause sterility. Several key theological and legal literature of the time condemned this practice, including Visigothic law and the Church.

Many herbal potions containing emmenagogues did not contain abortifacients (substances that induce abortion) and were instead used to cure amenorrhoea (a lack of period). There are several different types of literature in the humoral tradition that propose the use of herbal potions or suppositories to provoke menstruation.

==Famous potion makers==

===Giulia Tofana and Gironima Spana===
Giulia Tofana (1581-1651) was an Italian poisoner, known as the inventor of the famous poison Aqua Tofana. Born in Sicily, she invented and started to sell the poison in Palermo in Sicily. She later established herself in Rome, where she continued the business, specialising in selling to women in abusive marriages who wanted to become widows. She died peacefully in 1651 and left the business to her stepdaughter Gironima Spana, who expanded it to a substantial business in the 1650s. The organization was exposed in 1659 and resulted in the famous Spana Prosecution, which became a subject of sensationalistic mythologization for centuries.

===Paula de Eguiluz===
Paula de Eguiluz was born into slavery in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic in the 17th century. Within the area in which she lived, sickness and disease ravaged the towns and major cities. Paula de Eguiluz decided to research and find her own cures to these maladies. Because of this, she is widely known for being involved in health care and healing.

Once her healing and health care practice took off, she started to sell potions and serums to clients. de Eguiluz&#x27;s business attracted a following and slowly got her into a bit of trouble.

Due to Paula&#x27;s healing accomplishments, she was arrested approximately 3 times. During these inquisitions, she was forced to tell the jury that she performed witchcraft. In response to these false confessions, she was imprisoned and whipped several times.

===Catherine Monvoisin===
Catherine Monvoisin, better known to some as La Voisin, was born within the year 1640 in France.

Catherine Monvoisin married Antoine Monvoisin who was a jeweler in Paris. His business plummeted and Catherine had to find work in order for her and her family to survive. She had a knack for reading people very accurately coupled with chiromancy and utilized her skills in order to make money.

La Voisin would read people&#x27;s horoscopes and perform abortions, but she also sold potions and poisons to her clients. Her work quickly became well known throughout France and people would quickly become her clients. Around the year 1665, her fortune telling was questioned by Saint Vincent de Paul&#x27;s Order, but she was quick to dismiss the allegations of witchcraft.

Catherine would then begin making potions whether it be for love, murder, or everyday life. Her love potion consisted of bones, the teeth of moles, human blood, Spanish fly beetles, and even small amounts of human remains. Her predecessor and major influence was Giulia Tofana.

On March 12, 1679, Catherine was arrested Notre- Dame Bonne- Nouvelle due to a string of incidents involving her and her potions. She confessed her crimes of murder and told authorities a majority of everything they needed to know about the people she knowingly murdered.

On February 22, 1680, La Voisin was sentenced to a public death wherein she was to be burned as the stake for witchcraft.

===Jacqueline Felicie===
Jacqueline Felice de Almania was tried in Italy in 1322 for the unlicensed practice of medicine. She was mainly accused of doing a learned male physicians job and accepting a fee. This job involved &quot;examining urine by its physical appearance; touching the body; and prescribing potions, digestives, and laxatives.&quot; Eight witnesses testified to her medical experience and wisdom. However, as she had not attended university, her knowledge was dismissed. Jacqueline Felice was then found guilty and fined and excommunicated from the church.

==Popular types of potions==
Emotions such as anger, fear, and sadness are universal and as such potions have been created across history and cultures in response to these human emotions.

===Love potion===
Love potions have been used throughout history and cultures. Scandinavians often used love-philtres, which is documented in the Norse poem The Lay of Gudrun.

In 17th-century Cartagena, Afro-Mexican curer (curanderos/as) and other Indigenous healers could gain an income and status from selling spells and love potions to women trying to secure men and financial stability. These love potions were sold to women of all social classes, who often wished to gain sexual agency.

===Restorative potion===

====Confectio Alchermes====
In the early 9th century, Arab physician Yuhanna ̄ Ibn Masawaih used the dye kermes to create a potion called &quot;Confectio Alchermes&quot;. The potion was &quot;intended for the caliph and his court and not for commoners.&quot; The potion was intended to cure heart palpitations, restore strength and cure madness and depression.

During the Renaissance in Europe, &quot;Confectio Alchermes&quot; was used widely. Recipes for the potion appeared in the work of the popular English apothecary Nicholas Culpeper and the official pharmacopoeia handbooks of London and Amsterdam. Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s French ambassador was even treated with the remedy; however, the recipe was altered to include a &quot;unicorn&#x27;s horn&quot; (possibly a ground-up narwhal tusk) in addition to the traditional ingredients. The ingredients for the potion mainly included ambergris, cinnamon, aloes, gold leaf, musk, pulverized lapis lazuli, and white pearls.

====St Paul&#x27;s potion====
St Paul&#x27;s potion was intended to cure epilepsy, catalepsy and stomach problems. Many ingredients used in the potion had medicinal value. According to Toni Mount the list of ingredients included &quot;liquorice, sage, willow, roses, fennel, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, cormorant blood, mandrake, dragon&#x27;s blood and three kinds of pepper&quot;.

Many of these ingredients still have medicinal value in the 21st century. Liquorice can be used to treat coughs and bronchitis. Sage can help memory and improve blood flow to the brain. Willow contains salicylic acid, which is a component of aspirin. Fennel, cinnamon and ginger are all carminatives, which help relieve gas in the intestines. The cormorant blood adds iron to treat anemia. If used in small doses, Mandrake is a good sleeping draught (though in large doses Mandrake can be poisonous.) Dragon&#x27;s blood refers to the bright red resin of the tree Dracaena draco. According to Toni Mount &quot;it has antiseptic, antibiotic, anti-viral and wound-healing properties, and it is still used in some parts of the world to treat dysentery.&quot;

===Immortality potion===
Creating a potion for immortality, was a common pursuit of alchemists throughout history. The Elixir of Life is a famous potion that aimed to create eternal youth. During the Chinese dynasties, this elixir of life was often recreated and drunk by emperors, nobles and officials. In India, there is a myth of the potion amrita, a drink of immortality made out of nectar.

===Psychedelic potions===

====Ayahuasca====
Ayahuasca, is a hallucinogenic plant-based potion used in many parts of the world. It was first created by indigenous South Americans from the Amazon basin as a spiritual medicine. The potion was often administered by a shaman during a ceremony. The potion contains the boiled stems of the ayahuasca vine and leaves from the chacruna plant. Chacruna contains dimethyltryptamine (also known as DMT), a psychedelic drug. The potion caused users to vomit or &#x27;purge&#x27; and induced hallucinations.

==Folklore==
Potions or mixtures are common within many of local mythologies. In particular, references to love potions are common in many cultures. Yusufzai witches, for example, would bathe a recently deceased leatherworker and sell the water to those seeking a male partner; this practice is said to exist in a modified form in modern times.

==Famous potions in literature==
Potions have played a critical role in many pieces of literature.  Shakespeare wrote potions into many of his plays including a love potion in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, poison in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and Juliet takes a potion to fake her death in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

In the fairytale &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; by Hans Christian Andersen, the Little Mermaid wishes to become human and have an immortal soul.  She visits the Sea Witch who sells her a potion, in exchange for which she cuts out the Little Mermaid&#x27;s tongue.  The Sea Witch makes the potion using her own blood that she cuts from her breast.  She warns the Little Mermaid that it will feel as if she had been cut with a sword when her fin becomes legs, that she will never be able to become a mermaid again, and risks turning into seafoam and not having an immortal soul if she fails to win the Prince&#x27;s love.  The Little Mermaid decides to take the potion which successfully turns her into a human so that she can try to win the love of the Prince and an immortal soul.

In the novella &quot;The&quot; &quot;Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson, Dr. Henry Jekyll creates a potion that transforms him into an evil version of himself called Edward Hyde.  Dr. Jekyll does not explain how he created this potion because he felt his &quot;discoveries were incomplete,&quot; he only indicates that it requires a &quot;particular salt.&quot;  He uses the potion successfully to go back and forth between his normal self, Dr. Jekyll, and his evil self, Mr. Hyde.

In the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, potions also play a main role. The students are required to attend potion classes, taught by Severus Snape and Horace Slughorn and knowledge of potions often becomes a factor for many of the characters. Throughout the course of the story, several characters take Polyjuice Potion to impersonate other characters, while the use of Felix Felicus potion in Book 6 helps Harry Potter gain vital information about horcruxes.

==Popular ingredients used in potions==

===Solanaceous plants===
In the 11th century, plants belonging to the nightshade family Solanaceae were often used as an ingredients in the potions - aphrodisiac or otherwise - and flying ointments of witches. The specific nightshades used in such concoctions were usually tropane alkaloid-containing species belonging to the Old World tribes Hyoscyameae and Mandragoreae. These potions were known as &quot;pharmaka diabolika&quot; (&quot;devilish drugs&quot;).

The root of &quot;Mandragora officinarum&quot;, the celebrated mandrake, fabled in legend to shriek when uprooted, was often used to prepare sleeping potions, although it could prove poisonous in excess, due to its tropane alkaloid content. &quot;M. officinarum&quot; is native to the Mediterranean region. Administered in small doses mandrake root has been used in folk medicine as an analgesic, an aphrodisiac and a remedy for infertility. Larger doses act as an entheogen of the deliriant class, having the potential to cause profound confusion and dysphoria characterised by realistic hallucinations of an unpleasant character. Classical and Renaissance authors have left certain accounts of the use of the plant by witches in the preparation of potions intended variously to excite love, cause insanity or even kill. Scopolamine, a toxic, deliriant alkaloid present in (and named after) &quot;Scopolia carniolica&quot; and also present in Mandragora, Hyoscyamus and other Solanaceae, was used by the infamous Dr. Crippen to kill his wife.

===Spanish fly===
In ancient Greece, the Spanish fly (also known as &quot;cantharides)&quot; was crushed with herbs and used in love potions. It was believed to be effective due to the bodily warmth that resulted from ingesting it. However, this was actually a result of inflammation from toxins in the tissues of the beetle. Ferdinand II of Aragon drank many potions and elixir contains the Spanish fly.

===Cochineal===
Cochineal, another type of dye, replaced kermes as an ingredient in Confectio Alchermes in the 17th and 18th centuries. Cochineal was also heavily used as an ingredient in potions for jaundice. Jaundice potions were a mix of Cochineal, cream of tartar and Venetian soap and patients were directed to take it three times a day.

===Cannabis and opium===
Cannabis and opium has been used in potions throughout human history. Potions containing cannabis and/or opium were particularly popular in Arabia, Persia, and Muslim India after the arrival of the drugs around the 9th century. Cannabis and opium were a common ingredient used in potions and tinctures sold by apothecaries in 19th-century Europe, as the ingredients made patients feel better, and the addictive nature of the drug meant it sold well. Nepenthes pharmakon is a famous type of magical potion recorded in Homer&#x27;s Odyssey, intended to cure sorrow. In Ancient Greek &quot;Pharmakon&quot; was the word for medicine and &quot;Nepenthes&quot; meant no (&quot;ne)&quot; sorrow (&quot;penthes).&quot; Since the 18th century it is believed to be made from opium.

<text>The Oxford Classical Dictionary (OCD) is generally considered &quot;the best one-volume dictionary on antiquity,&quot; an encyclopædic work in English consisting of articles relating to classical antiquity and its civilizations. It was first published in 1949 (&quot;OCD&quot;1 or &quot;OCD&quot;), edited by Max Cary with the assistance of H. J. Rose, H. P. Harvey, and Alexander Souter. A second edition followed in 1970 (&quot;OCD&quot;2), edited by Nicholas G. L. Hammond and H. H. Scullard, and a third edition in 1996 (&quot;OCD&quot;3), edited by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth. A revised third edition was released in 2003, which is nearly identical to the previous third edition. A fourth edition was published in 2012 (&quot;OCD&quot;4), edited by Simon Hornblower, Antony Spawforth, and Esther Eidinow. In 2016, a fully digital edition launched online, edited by Sander Goldberg (2013–2017) and Tim Whitmarsh (2018–present). Continuously updated on a monthly basis, this edition incorporates all 6,300 entries from &quot;OCD&quot;4 (which are being updated on a rolling basis) as well as newly commissioned entries, and features multimedia content and freely accessible maps of the ancient world.

The &quot;OCD&quot;&#x27;s over 6,400 articles cover everything from the daily life of the ancient Greeks and Romans to their geography, religion, and their historical figures.

==Digital and on-line availability==
The fourth edition and the third revised edition of the &quot;OCD&quot; are available online for members of subscribed institutions and for subscribed individuals via Oxford Reference. The third edition (1996) was also available on CD-ROM, but it is partially incompatible with more recent versions of Windows and has not been revised or re-released.

The new digital edition is accessible online to institutional and individual subscribers via the &quot;Oxford Research Encyclopedias&quot;. Entry extracts/summaries and select full-length entries are freely available to non-subscribing individuals.

==&quot;Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization&quot;==
The &quot;Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization&quot; (&quot;OCCC&quot;), part of the Oxford Companions series of Oxford University Press, is an independent publication consisting of a selection of articles from the &quot;OCD&quot;, with accompanying illustrations. The first edition was published in 1998 (&quot;OCCC&quot;1 or &quot;OCCC&quot;), edited by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, and contains over 600 articles selected from the &quot;OCD&quot;3. A paperback edition was issued in 2004. The current second edition was published in 2014 (&quot;OCCC&quot;2), edited by Simon Hornblower, Antony Spawforth, and Esther Eidinow, and contains over 700 articles selected from the &quot;OCD&quot;4.

<doc id="252000" wikidata="Q953984" url="?curid=252000" title="Mammoth Mountain">
<text>Mammoth Mountain is a lava dome complex partially located in the town of Mammoth Lakes, California, in the Inyo National Forest of Madera and Mono counties. It is home to a large ski area primarily on the Mono County side.

Mammoth Mountain was formed in a series of eruptions that ended 57,000 years ago. Mammoth still produces hazardous volcanic gases that kill trees.

==Geology==
Mammoth Mountain is a lava dome complex in Mono County, California. It lies in the southwestern corner of the Long Valley Caldera and consists of about 12 rhyodacite and dacite overlapping domes. These domes formed in a long series of eruptions from 110,000 to 57,000 years ago, building a volcano that reaches in elevation. During this time, massive dacite eruptions occurred roughly every 5000 years. The volcano is still active with minor eruptions, the largest of which was a minor phreatic (steam) eruption 700 years ago.

Mammoth Mountain also lies on the south end of the Mono-Inyo chain of volcanic craters. The magma source for Mammoth Mountain is distinct from those of both the Long Valley Caldera and the Inyo Craters.
Mammoth Mountain is composed primarily of dacite and rhyolite, part of which has been altered by hydrothermal activity from fumaroles (steam vents).

==Volcanic gas discharge==
Mammoth is outgassing large amounts of carbon dioxide out of its south flank, near Horseshoe Lake, causing mazuku in that area. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the ground ranges from 20 to 90 percent . Measurements of the total discharge of carbon dioxide gas at the Horseshoe Lake tree-kill area range from per day. This high concentration causes trees to die in six regions that total about in size (see photo).

The tree-kills originally were attributed to a severe drought that affected California in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Another idea was that the kills were the result of a pathogen or other biological infestation. However, neither idea explained why all trees in the affected areas were killed regardless of age or health. Then, in March 1990, a U.S. Forest Service Ranger became ill with suffocation symptoms after being in a snow-covered cabin near Horseshoe Lake.
Measurements around the lake found that restrooms and tents had a greater than 1% concentration (toxic) and a deadly 25% concentration of in a small cabin. concentrations of less than 1% are typical and healthy in most soils; however, soil concentrations of in the tree-kill areas ranged from 20% to 90%. This overabundance of was found to be the cause of the tree-kills because tree roots need to absorb O2 directly and the high level reduced available O2. Researchers also determined that Mammoth releases about of every day. As of 2003, the concentration of carbon dioxide in soil gas at Mammoth Mountain is being monitored on a continuous, year-round basis at four sites—three at Horseshoe Lake and one near the base of the previous Chair 19 at the ski area.

The most likely sources of the are degassing of intruded magma and gas release from limestone-rich metasedimentary rocks that are heated by magmatic intrusions. The remarkable uniformity in chemical and isotopic composition of the and accompanying gases at different locations around Mammoth Mountain indicates that there may actually be a large reservoir of gas deep below the mountain from which gas escapes along faults to the surface. Measurements of helium emissions support the theory that the gases emitted in the tree kill area have the same source as those discharged from Mammoth Mountain Fumarole. There is evidence that the rate of discharge has been declining, with emissions peaking in 1991.

===Ski patrol fatalities incident===
In April 2006, three members of the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area ski patrol died while on duty when a fumarole caused a snow bridge to collapse under the patrollers. The 2005/2006 winter season delivered significant snow depth of . As the ski patrollers assessed the fumarole for skier safety, the perimeter snow collapsed, dropping the patrollers into the bottom of the fumarole, exposing them to extremely high levels of carbon dioxide. It is unclear if they died as a result of the fall or as a result of the gas.

==Climate==
==Recreational use==

Mammoth Mountain is home to the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, founded by Dave McCoy in 1953. Mammoth is a ski, snowboard, and snowmobile mountain during the winter months. Mammoth is the highest ski resort in California and is notable for the unusually large amount of snowfall it receives compared to other Eastern Sierra peaks—about annually and about 300 out of 365 days of sunshine—due to its location in a low gap in the Sierra crest. The ski area has more than of skiable terrain, with of vertical serviced by 25 lifts. In the summer months the ski gondolas are used by mountain bikers and tourists who wish to get a summit view of Long Valley Caldera directly to the east and Sierra peaks to the west, south and north. To the south of the mountain, there are a number of lakes that serve as tourist attractions in the summer.

<doc id="252006" wikidata="Q474769" url="?curid=252006" title="Dabiša of Bosnia">
<text>Stephen Dabiša (; ; died on 8 September 1395) was as a member of the Kotromanić dynasty who reigned as King of Bosnia from March 1391 until his death. Elected to succeed the first king, Tvrtko I, Dabiša at first maintained the integrity of the Kingdom of Bosnia. He successfully resisted Hungary, Naples, and even Ottoman Turks. The latter part of his reign, however, saw the ascent of magnates and considerable loss of Bosnia&#x27;s territory and influence.

== Background ==

Dabiša&#x27;s relationship with the rest of the Kotromanić family is uncertain. In a letter, Dabiša called himself younger brother of Tvrtko I, who became Ban of Bosnia in 1353, but this should not be taken literally. He certainly was a relative of Tvrtko I though. Influenced by the writings of the 16th century Ragusan chronicler Mavro Orbini, modern historiography usually describes Dabiša as the illegitimate son of Ninoslav, who was the brother of Tvrtko&#x27;s father Vladislav.

According to Orbini, Dabiša ruled the &quot;župa&quot; (county) of Neretva (corresponding to the area around the Upper Neretva and the town of Konjic) and, supporting Tvrtko&#x27;s brother Vuk, took part in the rebellion that led to the deposition of Tvrtko in 1366. Dabiša, however, is the only rebel mentioned by Orbini whose name does not appear in contemporary accounts of the uprising. Tvrtko prevailed in 1367 and banished Dabiša, revoking his lands. Dabiša spent the following two decades in obscurity, while Tvrtko had himself crowned King of Bosnia in 1377.

== Election and initial success ==
Dabiša appears to have mended his relations with King Tvrtko I in the late 1380s, as he is recorded at royal court in Sutjeska in June 1390. Under unclear circumstances following Tvrtko&#x27;s sudden death on 10 March 1391, Dabiša was elected king by the &quot;rusag&quot;. He immediately notified the authorities of the neighbouring republics of Venice and Ragusa, which recognized his accession on 1 and 15 June respectively, as well as the kings Sigismund of Hungary and Ladislaus of Naples. Following in his predecessor&#x27;s footsteps, Dabiša took up using the royal name Stephen.

In the first years of his reign, Dabiša successfully maintained the integrity of Tvrtko&#x27;s Kingdom of Bosnia, which included not only Bosnia proper, but also Croatia proper, Dalmatia, Zachlumia, and Rascia. The former two had been conquered from King Sigismund and Queen Mary of Hungary, and the Republic of Ragusa&#x27;s immediate attempts to convince the Dalmatian cities to return to the fold of the Hungarian Crown ended in failure. Sigismund and Mary were not the only one claiming Dalmatia - or the Hungarian lands in general. Insisting that Dabiša did not support his bid for the Hungarian throne as effectively as his predecessor had, King Ladislaus of Naples started to enforce his own claim to Dalmatia and Croatia. Tvrtko I had professed to support Ladislaus when he expanded his realm to include those lands. Dabiša nevertheless remained at Ladislaus&#x27; side in his struggle against Sigismund.

From Tvrtko I, Dabiša also inherited the hostility of the Hungarian king, who strived to recover the territories lost to Tvrtko. Sigismund&#x27;s wish to have his war against Bosnia equated to a crusade obtained Pope Boniface IX&#x27;s approval. Dabiša was Roman Catholic, but a substantial population of his kingdom consisted of adherents of the Bosnian Church and the Serbian Orthodox Church, branded &quot;heretics and schismatics&quot; respectively in Sigismund&#x27;s letter to Boniface. It is not known what came about this planned offensive. In the spring of 1392, Dabiša&#x27;s troops defeated an Ottoman Turkish incursion, reminiscing Tvrtko&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Bileća. Within a year, Dabiša and Sigismund had agreed to a truce.

== Signs of decline ==

While the Kingdom of Bosnia retained its standing among neighbouring states in the immediate aftermath of Tvrtko I&#x27;s death, it was already during Dabiša&#x27;s reign that conditions within the state started deteriorating. The nobility grew stronger and for the first time acted independently of the king, starting with the Zachlumian Sanković noble family. Dabiša curbed the Sanković power, but the trend was irreversible and eventually led to the weakening of the royal authority. Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, the kingdom&#x27;s leading magnate, who governed Croatia on behalf of the Bosnian crown and in defiance of Hungarian claims, came into agreement with Sigismund and Mary but remained loyal to Dabiša. Dabiša and his other vassals were coming closer to an agreement with Sigismund as well, and the two kings were expected to make the Compromise of Đakovo in May 1393. In the end, the meeting did not take place.

By June 1394, King Dabiša was in open conflict with John Horvat, a fervent supporter of Ladislaus and enemy of Sigismund. He ordered that men from his islands of Brač, Hvar, and Korčula assist in the siege of Omiš, a city ruled by Horvat. Sigismund, who had been amassing an army since April, took advantage of the discord. The Battle of Dobor saw John Horvat&#x27;s defeat and execution as well as destruction of the eponymous town on the river Bosna by Sigismund&#x27;s troops. Soon thereafter, in a camp near the ruins of the town, Dabiša submitted to Sigismund. He resigned Croatia and Dalmatia to the Hungarian king and, with the agreement of his vassals, recognized him as his feudal overlord as well as heir designate to the Bosnian throne. It is not clear what prompted Dabiša to agree to such harsh terms. In return, as evident from a treaty issued in July 1394, Sigismund included Dabiša among the highest ranking Hungarian officials and named him &quot;ispán&quot; (count) of Somogy.

== Death and legacy ==

The agreement to recognize Sigismund as king following Dabiša indicates that the latter was by then of advanced age. Indeed, King Dabiša&#x27;s health deteriorated in early 1395. At the end of March, writing from Bišće in Hum land, Dabiša requested that Ragusan authorities send a physician. The following month, in Sutjeska, he issued a charter granting the Zachlumian village of Veljaci to his daughter Stana, whose daughter Vladika was married to the nobleman Juraj Radivojević. He died on 8 September 1395. Despite initially consenting to his agreement with Sigismund, it was Dabiša&#x27;s widow, Helen, who succeeded in ascending the throne with the support of the magnates.

Despite an auspicious start, Dabiša&#x27;s reign ended with the Kingdom of Bosnia displaying first signs of decay. Much of Tvrtko&#x27;s extraordinary legacy was lost in the summer of 1394, and the state resumed its previous boundaries. Dabiša left the Bosnian state more dependent on Hungary than ever before, and the kingdom&#x27;s influence in the Balkans waned.

<text>Language technology, often called human language technology (HLT), studies methods of how computer programs or electronic devices can analyze, produce, modify or respond to human texts and speech. Working with language technology often requires broad knowledge not only about linguistics but also about computer science. It consists of natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics (CL) on the one hand, many application oriented aspects of these, and more low-level aspects such as encoding and speech technology on the other hand. 

Note that these elementary aspects are normally not considered to be within the scope of related terms such as natural language processing and (applied) computational linguistics, which are otherwise near-synonyms. As an example, for many of the world&#x27;s lesser known languages, the foundation of language technology is providing communities with fonts and keyboard setups so their languages can be written on computers or mobile devices.

<doc id="252009" wikidata="Q1199022" url="?curid=252009" title="Radical of an ideal">
<text>In ring theory, a branch of mathematics, the radical of an ideal formula_1 of a commutative ring is another ideal defined by the property that an element formula_2 is in the radical if and only if some power of formula_2 is in formula_1. Taking the radical of an ideal is called &quot;radicalization&quot;. A radical ideal (or semiprime ideal) is an ideal that is equal to its radical. The radical of a primary ideal is a prime ideal.

This concept is generalized to non-commutative rings in the semiprime ring article.

==Definition==

The radical of an ideal formula_1 in a commutative ring formula_6, denoted by formula_7 or formula_8, is defined as
:formula_9

(note that formula_10).
Intuitively, formula_8 is obtained by taking all roots of elements of formula_1 within the ring formula_6. Equivalently, formula_8 is the preimage of the ideal of nilpotent elements (the nilradical) of the quotient ring formula_15 (via the natural map formula_16). The latter proves that formula_8 is an ideal.

If the radical of formula_1 is finitely generated, then some power of formula_8 is contained in formula_1. In particular, if formula_1 and formula_22 are ideals of a Noetherian ring, then formula_1 and formula_22 have the same radical if and only if formula_1 contains some power of formula_22 and formula_22 contains some power of formula_1.

If an ideal formula_1 coincides with its own radical, then formula_1 is called a &quot;radical ideal&quot; or &quot;semiprime ideal&quot;.

==Examples==
* Consider the ring formula_31 of integers.
*# The radical of the ideal formula_32 of integer multiples of formula_33 is formula_34 (the evens).
*# The radical of formula_35 is formula_35.
*# The radical of formula_37 is formula_38.
*# In general, the radical of formula_39 is formula_40, where formula_41 is the product of all distinct prime factors of formula_42, the largest square-free factor of formula_42 (see Radical of an integer). In fact, this generalizes to an arbitrary ideal (see the Properties section).
* Consider the ideal formula_44. It is trivial to show formula_45 (using the basic property but we give some alternative methods: The radical formula_8 corresponds to the nilradical formula_47 of the quotient ring formula_48, which is the intersection of all prime ideals of the quotient ring. This is contained in the Jacobson radical, which is the intersection of all maximal ideals, which are the kernels of homomorphisms to fields. Any ring homomorphism formula_49 must have formula_50 in the kernel in order to have a well-defined homomorphism (if we said, for example, that the kernel should be formula_51 the composition of formula_52 would be formula_53, which is the same as trying to force formula_54). Since formula_55 is algebraically closed, every homomorphism formula_56 must factor through formula_55, so we only have to compute the intersection of formula_58 to compute the radical of formula_59 We then find that formula_60

==Properties==
This section will continue the convention that &quot;I&quot; is an ideal of a commutative ring formula_6:

*It is always true that formula_62, i.e. radicalization is an idempotent operation. Moreover, formula_8 is the smallest radical ideal containing formula_1.
*formula_8 is the intersection of all the prime ideals of formula_6 that contain formula_1formula_68and thus the radical of a prime ideal is equal to itself. Proof: &quot;On one hand, every prime ideal is radical, and so this intersection contains formula_8. Suppose formula_41 is an element of formula_6 that is not in formula_8, and let formula_73 be the set formula_74. By the definition of formula_8, formula_73 must be disjoint from formula_1. formula_73 is also multiplicatively closed. Thus, by a variant of Krull&#x27;s theorem, there exists a prime ideal formula_79 that contains formula_1 and is still disjoint from formula_73 (see Prime ideal). Since formula_79 contains formula_1, but not formula_41, this shows that formula_41 is not in the intersection of prime ideals containing formula_1. This finishes the proof.&quot; The statement may be strengthened a bit: the radical of formula_1 is the intersection of all prime ideals of formula_6 that are minimal among those containing formula_1.
*Specializing the last point, the nilradical (the set of all nilpotent elements) is equal to the intersection of all prime ideals of formula_6 formula_91This property is seen to be equivalent to the former via the natural map formula_16, which yields a bijection formula_93: formula_94 defined by formula_95
*An ideal formula_1 in a ring formula_6 is radical if and only if the quotient ring formula_15 is reduced.
*The radical of a homogeneous ideal is homogeneous.
*The radical of an intersection of ideals is equal to the intersection of their radicals: formula_99.
*The radical of a primary ideal is prime. If the radical of an ideal formula_1 is maximal, then formula_1 is primary.
*If formula_1 is an ideal, formula_103. Since prime ideals are radical ideals, formula_104 for any prime ideal formula_79.
*Let formula_106 be ideals of a ring formula_6. If formula_108 are comaximal, then formula_109 are comaximal.
*Let formula_110 be a finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring formula_6. Thenformula_112 where formula_113 is the support of formula_110 and formula_115 is the set of associated primes of formula_110.

==Applications==
The primary motivation in studying radicals is Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz in commutative algebra. One version of this celebrated theorem states that for any ideal formula_22 in the polynomial ring formula_118 over an algebraically closed field formula_119, one has
:formula_120
where
:formula_121
and
:formula_122
Geometrically, this says that if a variety formula_123 is cut out by the polynomial equations formula_124, then the only other polynomials that vanish on formula_123 are those in the radical of the ideal formula_126. 

Another way of putting it: the composition formula_127 is a closure operator on the set of ideals of a ring.

<doc id="252013" wikidata="Q279693" url="?curid=252013" title="Stefan Uroš V">
<text>Saint Stefan Uroš V (, ; 13362/4 December 1371), known in historiography and folk tradition as Uroš the Weak (), was the second Emperor (Tsar) of the Serbian Empire (1355–1371), and before that he was Serbian King and co-ruler (since 1346) with his father, Emperor Stefan Dušan.

==Early life==
Stefan Uroš V was the only son of Stefan Uroš IV Dušan by Helena of Bulgaria, the sister of Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria. He had been crowned as king (second highest title) in the capacity of heir and co-ruler after Dušan was crowned emperor in 1346. Although by the time of his succession as sole ruler and emperor in 1355 Stefan Uroš V was no longer a minor, he remained heavily dependent on his mother and various members of the court.

==Reign==
The account of the contemporary John VI Kantakouzenos describes the descent of the Serbian Empire into disintegration soon after the death of Uroš&#x27; father and his accession. However, Kantakouzenos mainly focused on the Greek lands rather than the Serbian core lands. Further the general disorder along with the powerlessness of the center represents the situation that arose much later in Uroš&#x27;s reign. According to Mihaljčić, during the initial years of his rule the threats to the territorial integrity of Uroš&#x27;s empire in the south came mainly from external attacks.
The death of Uroš&#x27;s father was quickly followed by the death of Preljub, who governed Thessaly. In the spring of 1356, Nikephoros Orsini landed a force on the coast of Thessaly and quickly overran it. He then followed up this success by driving despot Simeon Uroš from Aetolia and Acarnania. Simeon was a paternal uncle and the closest male relative of young Emperor Uroš. Retreating to Epirus and western Macedonia, he seized Kostur and proclaimed himself Tsar in hope of becoming co-ruler, or even replacing young Uroš on the Serbian throne. His claim was not widely welcomed, and the support he gained was limited to some southern regions. The Sabor (state council) held in Skoplje did not accept Simeon&#x27;s claims and following the endorsement of the magnates, Uroš became more energetic in his political activities, publishing a number of charters. In 1358, Simeon attacked the Skadar region, trying to capture the old Serbia region of Zeta, but was defeated. Defeated in the north, Simeon again turned to south, retaking Epirus and Thessaly in 1359, where he continued to rule with the title &quot;emperor of Serbs and Greeks&quot;.

There is one account, early in his reign, that is in contrast to his general record of incompetence. In 1356, Matthew Kantakouzenos, a pretender to the Byzantine throne, gathered an army of 5,000 Turks and marched on Serres, the Serbian-held capital of Jovan Uglješa. Uroš V, whose mother ruled from Serres, decided to raise an army to defend his mother. In 1357, when Matthew and his Turks attacked, the Serbian army under Vojihna of Drama (a major player in that region) came to aid. The Turks were defeated. Matthew Kantakouzenos was captured and held hostage until his ransom was paid by the Byzantine Emperor John V Palaiologos.

In following years, the Serbian Empire gradually fragmented into a conglomeration of principalities, some of which did not even nominally acknowledge Uroš&#x27;s rule. His position was not helped by his mother Helena, who started to rule autonomously from Serres in alliance with Jovan Uglješa. A similarly autonomous posture was assumed by the Dejanović family, the Balšić family, Nikola Altomanović. By 1365, the most powerful Serbian nobleman became Uglješa&#x27;s brother Vukašin Mrnjavčević who became co-ruler with Emperor Uroš and was granted the title of Serbian King. By 1369, as Uroš was childless, Vukašin designated his eldest son Prince Marko as heir to the throne, with the title of &quot;young king&quot;.

Stefan Uroš V died childless in December 1371, after much of the Serbian nobility had been destroyed by the Turks in the Battle of Maritsa earlier that year. The exact cause of his death at a relatively young age remains unknown. Vukašin&#x27;s son Prince Marko inherited his father&#x27;s royal title, but real power in northern Serbia was held by Lazar Hrebeljanović. The latter did not assume the imperial or royal titles (associated with the Nemanjić dynasty), and in 1377 accepted King Tvrtko I of Bosnia (a maternal grandson of Stefan Dragutin) as titular king of Serbia. Serbia proper became a vassal of the Ottomans in 1390, but remained effectively ruled by the Lazarević family and then by their Branković successors until the fall of Smederevo in 1459.

The exceptional modesty and tolerance of this ruler was the main reason he was called &quot;the weak&quot;, and also the reason he was canonized 211 years after his death.

Stefan Uroš V was canonized by the Serbian Orthodox Church. His body is kept in the Jazak monastery on Fruška Gora mountain.

==Legacy==

Today, Stefan Uroš V is viewed mostly in contrast to his able and strong-willed father, as a lacking and indecisive ruler, unable to keep the Serbian nobility under his control, whose weak and unassertive personality greatly contributed to the fall of the Empire and the eventual destruction of the Serbian state by the Ottomans. In Serbian folklore and epic poems he is often described as a just, well-intentioned ruler of pleasant appearance but weak character. While this view is popular among historians as well, some argue that he was not especially incompetent in his role as Emperor of Serbia, and that the decline of the empire was much less spectacular and started much later into his rule than popular opinion suggests. For a long time, it was considered a historical fact that he was murdered by his co-ruler, Vukašin Mrnjavčević, but eventually Vukašin was proven to have died before the Emperor.

In 1825 Stefan Stefanović, a Serbian writer living in the Austrian Empire wrote a tragic play called &quot;The Death of Uroš V&quot;, which drew inspiration from both facts and folk tradition about Uroš, including the aforementioned belief that he was killed by King Vukašin.

<doc id="252014" wikidata="Q17165793" url="?curid=252014" title="Premium-rate telephone number">
<text>Premium-rate telephone numbers are telephone numbers that charge callers higher price rates for select services, including information and entertainment. A portion of the call fees is paid to the service provider, allowing premium calls to be an additional source of revenue for businesses. Tech support, psychic hotlines, and adult chat lines (e.g. dating and phone sex) are among the most popular kinds of premium-rate phone services. Other services include directory enquiries, weather forecasts, competitions and ratings televoting (especially relating to television shows). Some businesses, e.g. low-cost airlines, and diplomatic missions, such as the US Embassy in London or the UK Embassy in Washington, have also used premium-rate phone numbers for calls from the general public.

Premium calls are typically independent of the caller&#x27;s area code. These telephone numbers are usually allocated based on a national telephone numbering plan that makes them easily distinguishable from non-premium numbers; telephone companies often offer their customers the option to block calls from these number ranges, and in some jurisdictions, are required by law to offer blocking services.

SMS (texting) also has a feature for premium rate services, however instead of standard telephone numbers, premium-rate texting uses so-called shortcodes, which are 4–6 digit numbers that work only for SMS.

==Africa==

=== Egypt ===
In Egypt, premium rate numbers begin with the prefix 0900, and for mobile services it uses short numbers to call or to send SMS to (4 digits only).

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, premium rate SMS short codes are four or five digits long, starting with either &#x27;3&#x27; or &#x27;4&#x27;. Premium rate telephone services are regulated by The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) and ranges from 0862 through 0869(increasing rates relating to the next digit after 086).

==Asia==
===Armenia===
In Armenia, premium numbers start with 900, followed by six digits.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, premium numbers begin with 0809 and are marketed by Telkom as Japati, an acronym for Jaringan Pintar Nasional (&quot;National Smart Network&quot;). Due to the number&#x27;s association with adult services (Telkom&#x27;s dial-up Internet service, Telkomnet Instan at 080989999 being a major exception) premium-rate phone services have come under public scrutiny and regulatory crackdown, most notably in May 2015 following rash of spam text messages enticing mobile phone users to dial them.

===Japan===
In Japan, premium rate telephone number service was currently known as &quot;Navi-dial&quot; and began with the prefix 0570 followed by six digits. The &quot;DIAL Q2&quot; service that&#x27;s number had the prefix 0990 was ended operations in early 2013.

===South Korea===
In South Korea, premium rate numbers start with the prefix 060 followed by 7 or 8 digits. Some consumers do not know that numbers starting with 060 are premium rate numbers because 060 is mistaken for one of long-distance area codes in Korea (there are 062, 061 and 063). They call back when they find that they miss a call to their mobile phones from a 060 number ending up paying for just making a call.

1588-#### and 1577-#### are not premium rate numbers per se. They are used by banks, insurance companies, nationwide restaurant chains, consumer electronics companies, online shopping malls and others for customer service and delivery order. In many cases, customers calling them are charged at a long-distance rate without knowing that they are making a long-distance call.

===Vietnam===
In Vietnam, premium rate numbers start with 1900; premium rate SMS have 4 digits starting with 4,5,6,7,8 and the 2nd digit decides the price (except 1400 - 1409 with variable prices from 3000-18000 VND per sms, reserved for charity and 156, 5656, 1414 which are free).

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan, premium rate numbers start with 0203, 0204 and 0209.

===Mongolia===
In Mongolia, premium rate numbers start with 1900.

==Europe==

In many European countries, such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom, it was common for organisations to operate customer service lines on premium-rate numbers using prefixes that fall outside the scope of the country&#x27;s premium-rate number regulations. Therefore, in contrast to North America where customer service numbers are typically free of charge to the caller, consumers in Europe often used to pay a premium above the cost of a normal telephone call. The EU Consumer Rights Directive 2011/EU/83, which came into force on 13 June 2014, was intended to eliminate this pricing model, but the law&#x27;s implementation and success varies widely from country to country.

In France, numbers starting with 08xx (International : +33 8(...)) are special rate numbers. They range from toll free numbers (080x) to premium numbers (08Rx) (R from 1 to 9) (called Audiotel by France Telecom). There are also various moderately priced numbers (from about 0.03 to 0.15 €/minute) in the 081x and 082x ranges. Most of these numbers are not reachable from outside France.

There are also special 4 digits numbers (national speed dial) in the form of 3xxx, for which billing rules can be the ones from any 08xx number, to the provider&#x27;s choice.

The split rule between different premium rate numbers is not clearly defined (premium rate information numbers and premium rate entertainment numbers).

The regulator (ARCEP, previously ART) had issued a range for Telephony over xDSL in the 087x range, which might confuse consumers, as calls to these numbers are billed as local calls nationwide. Starting 20 December 2005, these have been changed to 09xx numbers, which are dedicated to VoIP. All 087x numbers have been converted to 09xx numbers by 15 December 2008.

The digit after 0900 decides the kind of service offered, unlike 0190, where it determined the pricing. This is called offline billing and causes problems for coin telephones (where they are restricted entirely) or prepaid services.

This was when 09 numbers were designated as premium rate, with 0845 and 0870 numbers charged from landlines at rates that mirrored the cost of standard local and national phone calls respectively. Later, revenue share numbers starting 0844, 0871, 0843 and 0872 also came into use. Prior to all of this, when numbers were one digit shorter than they are today, a wide mix of prefixes were in use, from the well-recognized 0891 and 0898 prefixes to others such as 0331, 0345, 03745, 0541, 0645 and 0990.

In Australia, premium rate numbers generally begin with the prefix 19, with premium-rate voice services using the prefix 190x. Of these 1900 was the initial prefix and is the most common; since then 1901 and 1902 have also been allocated. The 1901 prefix is specifically reserved for &quot;restricted services&quot;, where a user must register with the provider of the service on that number - these can include services of a sexual nature, although this is not the only definition of &quot;restricted&quot;. The prefix 1906 is reserved for premium-rate paging services.

Other numbers beginning with 19 are generally used for premium rate short message service (SMS) services on mobile phones. These were originally trialled using the 188 prefix.

Previously (before the introduction of eight digit numbering), the prefix 0055 was used for this purpose, and as a result 190x numbers are occasionally referred to colloquially as &quot;0055 numbers&quot; (pronounced double-oh, double-five).

== Illicit use ==

Computer criminals have historically used premium-rate numbers to defraud unsuspecting Internet users. One scheme involved inducing computer users who used now-uncommon dial-up Internet access to download a program known as a dialer that surreptitiously dialed a premium-rate number, accumulating charges on the user&#x27;s phone bill without their knowledge. Another now-uncommon premium-rate scam involved television programming that induced young children to dial the number, banking on the notion that they will be unaware of the charges that will be incurred. One variant, targeted at children too young to dial a number, enticed children to hold a landline telephone up to the television set while the DTMF tones of the number were played. This type of scam was especially popular in the late 1980s to early 1990s in the United States before tougher regulations on the 900 number business forced many of these businesses to close.

<doc id="252020" wikidata="Q26444" url="?curid=252020" title="Tufted duck">
<text>The tufted duck (or tufted pochard) (Aythya fuligula) is a small diving duck with a population of close to one million birds, found in northern Eurasia. They are partially migratory. The scientific name is derived from Ancient Greek , an unidentified seabird mentioned by authors including Hesychius and Aristotle, and Latin &#x27;soot&#x27; and &quot;&quot; &#x27;throat&#x27;. It is a game bird. 

==Taxonomy==
The tufted duck was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Anas fuligula&quot;. He cited the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner who in 1555 had used the identical name &quot;Anas fuligula&quot; in his &quot;Historiae animalium&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Europe but in 1761 restricted it to Sweden. The tufted duck is now one of 12 species placed in the genus &quot;Aythya&quot; that was introduced in 1822 by the German naturalist Friedrich Boie. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;aithuia&quot;, an unidentified seabird mentioned by Aristotle, Hesychius and other authors. The specific epithet &quot;fuligula&quot; combines Latin meaning &quot;soot&quot; and &quot;gula&quot; meaning &quot;throat&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. An alternative common name is &quot;tufted pochard&quot;.

== Description ==
The adult male is all black except for white flanks and a blue-grey bill with gold-yellow eyes, along with a thin crest on the back of its head. It has an obvious head tuft that gives the species its name. The adult female is brown with paler flanks, and is more easily confused with other diving ducks. In particular, some have white around the bill base which resembles the scaup species, although the white is never as extensive as in those ducks. The females&#x27; call is a harsh, growling &quot;karr&quot;, mostly given in flight. The males are mostly silent but they make whistles during courtship based on a simple &quot;wit-oo&quot;.

The only ducks which are similar are the greater scaup and lesser scaup, but these species have no tuft and a different call.

The tufted duck is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

Refer to the following table for measurements of the tufted duck:
== Distribution and habitat==
The tufted duck breeds throughout temperate and northern Eurasia. It occasionally can be found as a winter visitor along both coasts of the United States and Canada. It is believed to have expanded its traditional range with the increased availability of open water due to gravel extraction, and the spread of freshwater mussels, a favourite food. These ducks are migratory in most of their range, and overwinter in the milder south and west of Europe, southern Asia and all year in the British Isles. One individual has been reported as far south as Melbourne, Australia. They form large flocks on open water in winter.

Their breeding habitat is close to marshes and lakes with plenty of vegetation to conceal the nest. They are also found on coastal lagoons, shorelines and sheltered ponds.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===

In northern Europe breeding takes place between mid May and the end of July. They are not colonial but sometimes the nests can be in a loose group. Most nests are placed beside water; an island site is preferred. The nest is built by the female and consists of depression in the ground that is lined with grass, reeds and down. The clutch consists of 8–11 greenish-grey eggs that measure . They are incubated by the female starting after the clutch is complete so that they hatch synchronously. The female covers the eggs with down when she is away from the nest. The eggs hatch after around 25 days (range 23–28 days). The young are precocial and nidifugous. They can feed themselves and are cared for by the female who broods them when they are small. They typically fledge when aged between 45 and 50 days. Tufted ducks usually first breed at one year but occasionally at 2 years.

=== Food and feeding===
These birds feed mainly by diving, but they will sometimes upend from the surface. They eat molluscs, aquatic insects and some plants and sometimes feed at night.

== Hunting ==
They are hunted as sport in the UK, Italy, Iran, Finland and Denmark, and commercially in Iran. Eggs used to be (and maybe continue to be) gathered in Iceland.
Because it feeds on the water bottom, it can taste &quot;muddy&quot; and is considered a less tasty duck.

<doc id="252027" wikidata="Q5267212" url="?curid=252027" title="Devil's Punch Bowl">
<text>The Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl is a visitor attraction and biological Site of Special Scientific Interest situated just to the east of the village of Hindhead in the English county of Surrey. It is part of the Wealden Heaths Phase II Special Protection Area.

The Punch Bowl is a large natural amphitheatre and is the source of many stories about the area. The London to Portsmouth road (the A3) skirted the rim of the site before the Hindhead Tunnel was built in 2011. The land is owned and maintained by the National Trust as part of the &quot;Hindhead Commons and the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl&quot; property. The highest point of the rim of the bowl is Gibbet Hill, which is above sea level and commands a panoramic view that includes, on a clear day, the skyline of London some away.

The Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl was featured on the 2005 TV programme &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; as one of the wonders of the South.

== Toponym ==

The name Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl dates from at least 1768, the year that John Rocque&#x27;s map of the area was published. This was 18 years before the murder of the unknown sailor on Gibbet Hill, so this event was clearly not the origin of the name. Prior to 1768, it was marked as &quot;ye Bottom&quot; on a map by John Ogilby dated 1675. The northern end of the Bowl is known as Highcombe Bottom which exists in different variants: Hackombe Bottom, Hacham Bottom, and Hackham Bottom.

== Geology ==
This part of Surrey comprises a sandstone known as the Hythe Formation that lies above a mudstone known as the Atherfield Clay Formation. The bowl&#x27;s deep depression is believed to be the result of erosion caused by spring water beneath the sandstone, causing the upper level to collapse. The steep slopes are characterised by heathland, streams and woodland.

The site, which has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest, has abundant wildlife such as the lesser spotted woodpecker and common redstart. It has been known for the wood warbler, a rare summer visitor with the last documented sighting in 2009.

== Roads ==
During the Tudor period in the 16th Century, Portsmouth developed into a major naval dockyard, needing access to London. The steep gradients of the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl and nearby Gibbet Hill made this difficult. As a consequence, there have been three phases of road construction through the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl. 

===Earliest route===

The Old Portsmouth Road is the oldest highway through the area. It is a ridgeway that skirts the Punch Bowl to the summit of Gibbet Hill before descending into Hindhead. The murder of an unknown sailor in 1786 on this route is commemorated by the Sailor&#x27;s Stone. The route is still used by walkers, cyclists and horse-riders.

===Turnpike===

In 1748 Kingston-Upon-Thames to Sheet Bridge Turnpike Company took over the management of Old Portsmouth Road. They installed mileposts, toll houses, gates and maintained the highway through the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl. However, by the early 19th Cenutry increased pedestrian and horse-drawn traffic meant this steep section of highway between Portsmouth and London required major improvements.

In 1826, the Portsmouth &amp; Sheet Bridge Turnpike Road Trust began asking for tenders from bidders to improve the road. The winning bid resulted in a completely new highway through the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl. Old Portmouth Road was abandoned in favour of a new cutting below the ridgeline. By digging into the hillside at a lower height, the new road removed the steep ascents and descents of the summit over Gibbet Hill. The surveyed route had a gradient of no more than 5% which meant larger and heavier horse-drawn carriages could now use this section of the road. 

In the 1920s, this route became the A3 when road numbering was introduced by the Ministry of Transport with the advent of motorised transport. For almost hundred years, it remained a principal route from London to Portsmouth.

=== Return to nature ===

By the start of the 21st century most of the A3 had become a dual carriageway, leaving only the section through Hindhead and the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl as single carriageway. Due to daily traffic volumes, this section operated at or above capacity for much of the day and had an accident rate 40% higher than the national average for that class of road. As a consequence, the decision to bypass the route over the Devil Punch Bowl was taken.

The Hindhead Tunnel opened in 2011 which passes directly under Gibbet Hill and the Punch Bowl. The 1826 turpike route of the former A3 was completely removed with the intention that it will revert to natural heathland.

== Conservation ==

The Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl, along with Hindhead Common, was acquired by the National Trust in 1906, making it one of the first open spaces acquired by the Trust. The beauty of the area and the diversity of nature it attracts resulted in the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl being designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest on 30 April 1986. 

This ownership and status helped save the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl from above-ground redevelopment of the A3 in the first decade of the 21st century. The National Trust co-operated with developers Balfour Beatty, who designed the alternative Hindhead Tunnel, running underneath the area. The tunnel preserves not only the area from the road widening originally proposed but also removes the heavy traffic congestion which previously affected this section of the A3 in peak hours.

The National Trust provide car parking and a cafe at the Hindhead end of the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl. A number of different footpaths, of differing length and difficulty, provide access to all parts of the Punch Bowl and surrounding area.

The Hindhead youth hostel, run by the Youth Hostel Association, used to be located inside the bowl but closed in 2015.

== In fiction ==
Punch Bowl Farm, at the northern end of the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl, was the home of children&#x27;s novelist Monica Edwards from 1947 until 1998. In her books she renamed the farm Punchbowl Farm. In Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;, Nicholas and Smike visit the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl on their journey to Portsmouth.

The third novel in the Horatio Hornblower series, &quot;Flying Colours&quot; by C.S. Forester, makes a one-line reference to the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl in chapter eighteen as Hornblower is returning to London: &quot;Even the marvellous beauty of the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl was lost on Hornblower as they drove past it.&quot;
The &quot;Devil&#x27;s Punch-Bowl in Surrey&quot; is briefly mentioned in &quot;The Shining Pyramid&quot;, a short story by Arthur Machen, and in &quot;The Manhood of Edward Robinson&quot;, the fifth story in Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;The Listerdale Mystery and Other Stories&quot;. The area is the setting for Sabine Baring-Gould&#x27;s novel &quot;The Broom-squire&quot;.

== Local legends ==
According to a local legend the Devil hurled lumps of earth at the god Thor to annoy him. The hollow out of which he scooped the earth became the Punch Bowl. The local village of Thursley means Thor&#x27;s place. An alternative version of this story says that Thor threw the lumps of earth at the Devil, who was annoying Thor by jumping across the Devil&#x27;s Jumps.

==Legacy project==

A lottery award from the Heritage Lottery Fund was made in 2012 for a project with young people from schools in the area, celebrating the landscape. Several sculptures marked the completion in early 2013 and a carving from a 3-tonne block of Portland stone by Jon Edgar now sits on the spine of the former A3 near the visitor centre.

<doc id="252035" wikidata="Q747023" url="?curid=252035" title="Macula">
<text>The macula (/ˈmakjʊlə/) or macula lutea is an oval-shaped pigmented area in the center of the retina of the human eye and in other animals. The macula in humans has a diameter of around and is subdivided into the umbo, foveola, foveal avascular zone, fovea, parafovea, and perifovea areas.

The anatomical macula at a size of is much larger than the clinical macula which, at a size of , corresponds to the anatomical fovea.

The macula is responsible for the central, high-resolution, color vision that is possible in good light. This kind of vision is impaired if the macula is damaged, as in macular degeneration. The clinical macula is seen when viewed from the pupil, as in ophthalmoscopy or retinal photography.

The term macula lutea comes from Latin &quot;macula&quot;, &quot;spot&quot;, and &quot;lutea&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;.

==Structure==

The macula is an oval-shaped pigmented area in the center of the retina of the human eye and other animal eyes. Its center is shifted slightly away from the optical axis (laterally, by 5°=1.5 mm).
The macula in humans has a diameter of around and is subdivided into the umbo, foveola, foveal avascular zone, fovea, parafovea, and perifovea areas.
An even smaller central region of highest receptor density (40–80 μm) is sometimes referred to as the &quot;foveal bouquet&quot;.
The anatomical macula at is much larger than the clinical macula which, at , corresponds to the anatomical fovea.

The clinical macula is seen when viewed from the pupil, as in ophthalmoscopy or retinal photography. The anatomical macula is defined histologically in terms of having two or more layers of ganglion cells. The umbo is the center of the foveola which in turn is located at the center of the fovea.

The fovea is located near the center of the macula. It is a small pit that contains the largest concentration of cone cells. The retina&#x27;s receptor layer contains two types of photosensitive cells, the rod cells and the cone cells.

===Color===
Because the macula is yellow in color, it absorbs excess blue and ultraviolet light that enter the eye and acts as a natural sunblock (analogous to sunglasses) for this area of the retina. The yellow color comes from its content of lutein and zeaxanthin, which are yellow xanthophyll carotenoids, derived from the diet. Zeaxanthin predominates at the macula, while lutein predominates elsewhere in the retina. There is some evidence that these carotenoids protect the pigmented region from some types of macular degeneration. A formulation of 10 mg lutein and 2 mg zeaxanthin has been shown to reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration progressing to advanced stages, although these carotenoids have not been shown to prevent the disease.

After death or enucleation (removal of the eye), the macula appears yellow, a color that is not visible in the living eye except when viewed with light from which red has been filtered.

===Regions===
* Fovea – 
* Foveal avascular zone (FAZ) – 
* Foveola – 
* Umbo – 

==Function==
Structures in the macula are specialized for high-acuity vision. Within the macula are the fovea and foveola that both contain a high density of cones, which are nerve cells that are photoreceptors with high acuity.

In detail, the normal human eye contains three different types of cones, with different ranges of spectral sensitivity. The brain combines the signals from neighboring cones to distinguish different colors. There is only one type of rod, but the rods are more sensitive than the cones, so in dim light, they are the dominant photoreceptors active, and without information provided by the separate spectral sensitivity of the cones it is impossible to discriminate colors. In the fovea &quot;centralis&quot;, cones predominate and are present at high density. The macula is thus responsible for the central, high-resolution, color vision that is possible in good light; and this kind of vision is impaired if the macula is damaged, for example in macular degeneration.

==Clinical significance==

The clinical macula is seen when viewed from the pupil, as in ophthalmoscopy or retinal photography.

Whereas loss of peripheral vision may go unnoticed for some time, damage to the macula will result in loss of central vision, which is usually immediately obvious.
The progressive destruction of the macula is a disease known as macular degeneration and can sometimes lead to the creation of a macular hole. Macular holes are rarely caused by trauma, but if a severe blow is delivered it can burst the blood vessels going to the macula, destroying it.

Visual input from the macula occupies a substantial portion of the brain&#x27;s visual capacity. As a result, some forms of visual field loss that occur without involving the macula are termed macular sparing. (For example, visual field testing might demonstrate &quot;homonymous hemianopsia with macular sparing&quot;.)

In the case of occipitoparietal ischemia owing to occlusion of elements of either posterior cerebral artery, patients may display cortical blindness (which, rarely, can involve blindness that the patient denies having, as seen in Anton&#x27;s Syndrome), yet display sparing of the macula. This selective sparing is due to the collateral circulation offered to macular tracts by the middle cerebral artery. Neurological examination that confirms macular sparing can go far in representing the type of damage mediated by an infarct, in this case, indicating that the caudal visual cortex (which is the principal recipient of macular projections of the optic nerve) has been spared. Further, it indicates that cortical damage rostral to, and including, lateral geniculate nucleus is an unlikely outcome of the infarction, as too much of the lateral geniculate nucleus is, proportionally, devoted to macular-stream processing.

<doc id="252048" wikidata="Q192715" url="?curid=252048" title="Samuel C. C. Ting">
<text>Samuel Chao Chung Ting (, born January 27, 1936) is a Taiwanese-American physicist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1976 with Burton Richter for discovering the subatomic J/ψ particle. He is the Thomas Dudley Cabot Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 

== Early life and education ==
Ting was born on January 27, 1936, at the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to first generation immigrant parents from Ju County, Shandong, province. His parents, Kuan-hai Ting and Tsun-ying Wong, met and married as graduate students at the University of Michigan. When Ting was born, his parents had just earned their master&#x27;s degrees from the University of Michigan and his father, a civil engineer, had received a professorship at the China University of Mining and Technology.

Ting&#x27;s parents returned to China two months after his birth where Ting was homeschooled by his parents throughout WWII. After the communist takeover of the mainland that forced the nationalist government to flee to Taiwan, Ting moved to the island in 1949. He would live there as a Taiwanese &quot;waishengren&quot; from 1949 to 1956 and conducted most of his formal schooling there. His father started to teach engineering and his mother would teach psychology at National Taiwan University (NTU). Ting attended and finished Middle School in Taiwan. After graduating from Cheng Kung Senior High School in Taipei, he entered National Cheng Kung University, where he remained for one semester of study.

In 1956, Ting, who barely spoke English, returned to the United States at the age of 20 and attended the University of Michigan. He studied engineering, mathematics, and physics, completing his bachelor&#x27;s degrees, master&#x27;s degree, and doctorate in only six years. He earned two Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees in engineering, mathematics, and physics in 1959, a Master of Science (M.S.) in physics in 1960, and his Ph.D. in physics in 1962. His doctoral studies were funded by a grant by the United States Atomic Energy Commission.

== Career ==
In 1963, Ting worked at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). From 1965, he taught at Columbia University in the City of New York and worked at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in Germany. Since 1969, Ting has been a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Ting received the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award in 1976, Nobel Prize in Physics in 1976, Eringen Medal in 1977, DeGaspari Award in Science from the Government of Italy in 1988, Gold Medal for Science from Brescia, Italy in 1988, and the NASA Public Service Medal in 2001.

== Nobel Prize ==
In 1976, Ting was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, which he shared with Burton Richter of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, for the discovery of the J/ψ meson nuclear particle. They were chosen for the award, in the words of the Nobel committee, &quot;for their pioneering work in the discovery of a heavy elementary particle of a new kind.&quot; The discovery was made in 1974 when Ting was heading a research team at MIT exploring new regimes of high energy particle physics.

Ting gave his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in Mandarin. Although there had been Chinese Nobel Prize recipients before (Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang), none had previously delivered the acceptance speech in Chinese. In his Nobel banquet speech, Ting emphasized the importance of experimental work:

: &quot;In reality, a theory in natural science cannot be without experimental foundations; physics, in particular, comes from experimental work. I hope that awarding the Nobel Prize to me will awaken the interest of students from the developing nations so that they will realize the importance of experimental work.&quot;

== Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ==
In 1995, not long after the cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider project had severely reduced the possibilities for experimental high-energy physics on Earth, Ting proposed the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, a space-borne cosmic-ray detector. The proposal was accepted and he became the principal investigator and has been directing the development since then. A prototype, &quot;AMS-01&quot;, was flown and tested on Space Shuttle mission STS-91 in 1998. The main mission, &quot;AMS-02&quot;, was then planned for launch by the Shuttle and mounting on the International Space Station.

This project is a massive $2 billion undertaking involving 500 scientists from 56 institutions and 16 countries. After the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, NASA announced that the Shuttle was to be retired by 2010 and that &quot;AMS-02&quot; was not on the manifest of any of the remaining Shuttle flights. Dr. Ting was forced to (successfully) lobby the United States Congress and the public to secure an additional Shuttle flight dedicated to this project. Also during this time, Ting had to deal with numerous technical problems in fabricating and qualifying the large, extremely sensitive and delicate detector module for space. &quot;AMS-02&quot; was successfully launched on Shuttle mission STS-134 on May 16, 2011, and was installed on the International Space Station on May 19, 2011.

== Research ==
* Discovery of nuclear anti-matter (the anti-deuteron). 
* Measuring the size of the electron family (the electron, the muon, and the tau) showing that the electron family has zero size (with a radius smaller than 10−17 cm).
* Precision study of light rays and massive light rays showing that light rays and massive light rays (vector mesons) can transform into each other at high energies and providing a critical verification of the quark model.
* Precision measurement of the radius of the atomic nuclei.
* Discovery of a new kind of matter (the J particle) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The Nobel Prize was awarded to Ting for this discovery.
* Discovery of the gluon (the particle responsible for transmitting the nuclear force).
* A systematic study of the properties of gluons.
* A precision measurement of muon charge asymmetry, demonstrating for the first time the validity of the Standard Electroweak Model (Steven Weinberg, Sheldon Glashow and Abdus Salam).
* Determination of the number of electron families and neutrino species in the Universe and the precision verification of the Electroweak Unification Theory.
* Proposed, constructed and leads the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment on the International Space Station involving the participation of a 16 nation collaboration searching for the existence of antimatter, the origin of dark matter and the properties of cosmic rays.
* Development of the first large superconducting magnet for space application. 
* AMS results, based on nine years in space and more than 160 billion cosmic rays, have changed our understanding of the cosmos.

== Personal life ==
Ting lived in a turbulent age during his childhood and his family was a big influence on him. In his biographical for the Nobel Prize, he recalled:

: &quot;Since both my parents were working, I was brought up by my maternal grandmother. My maternal grandfather lost his life during the first Chinese Revolution. After that, at the age of thirty-three, my grandmother decided to go to school, became a teacher, and brought my mother up alone. When I was young I often heard stories from my mother and grandmother recalling the difficult lives they had during that turbulent period and the efforts they made to provide my mother with a good education. Both of them were daring, original, and determined people, and they have left an indelible impression on me.&quot;

: &quot;When I was twenty years old I decided to return to the United States for a better education. My parents&#x27; friend, G.G. Brown, Dean of the School of Engineering, University of Michigan, told my parents I would be welcome to stay with him and his family. At that time I knew very little English and had no idea of the cost of living in the United States. In China, I had read that many American students go through college on their own resources. I informed my parents that I would do likewise. I arrived at the Detroit airport on 6 September 1956 with $100, which at the time seemed more than adequate. I was somewhat frightened, did not know anyone, and communication was difficult.&quot;

Ting is the eldest son of his family. He has one brother, Ting Chao-hua () and one sister, Ting Chao-min (). In an interview with China Central Television, he explained that the combination of his siblings&#x27; and his name is the first three characters of &quot;&quot; (Republic of China). His parents named them after the country to commemorate their grandfather, who was a martyr in the Xinhai Revolution.

In 1960, Ting married Kay Louise Kuhne, an architect, and together they had two daughters: Jeanne Ting Chowning and Amy Ting. In 1985, he married Dr. Susan Carol Marks, and they had one son, Christopher, born in 1986.

<doc id="252054" wikidata="Q2107094" url="?curid=252054" title="Power-up">
<text>In video games, a power-up is an object that adds temporary benefits or extra abilities to the player character as a game mechanic. This is in contrast to an item, which may or may not have a permanent benefit that can be used at any time chosen by the player. Although often collected directly through touch, power-ups can sometimes only be gained by collecting several related items, such as the floating letters of the word &#x27;EXTEND&#x27; in &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot;. Well known examples of power-ups that have entered popular culture include the power pellets from &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (regarded as the first power-up) and the Super Mushroom from &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, which ranked first in UGO Networks&#x27; &quot;Top 11 Video Game Powerups&quot;.

Items that confer power-ups are usually pre-placed in the game world, spawned randomly, dropped by beaten enemies or picked up from opened or smashed containers. They can be differentiated from items in other games, such as role-playing video games, by the fact that they take effect immediately, feature designs that do not necessarily fit into the game world (often used letters or symbols emblazoned on a design), and are found in specific genres of games. Power-ups are mostly found in action-oriented games such as maze games, run and guns, shoot &#x27;em ups, first-person shooters, and platform games.

==History and influence==

===Origins of the term===
The term &quot;power-up&quot; is an example of (Japanese pseudo-Anglicisms); the sense was coined in Japanese as a compound of and , literally &quot;to up someone&#x27;s or something&#x27;s power or abilities&quot;. The general meaning of &quot;X-up&quot; in Japanese is &quot;this will increase your X&quot;, and this construction is regularly used in areas such as advertising.

===First instances===

&quot;Pac-Man&quot; from 1980 is credited as the first video game to feature a power-up mechanic. Every maze in the game contains four Power Pellets which temporarily give Pac-Man the ability to eat ghosts, turning the tables on his pursuers. The effect of the power-up was illustrated by one of the first cut scenes to appear in a video game, in the form of brief comical interludes about Pac-Man and Blinky chasing each other around. The power pellet entered popular culture with a joke on video game controversies regarding the influence of video games on children.
In 1984, &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; introduced power-ups in the form of flowers which, when blossoming, provided effects such as speed up and invincibility.

In 1985, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; introduced the Super Mushroom, which has entered popular culture, being described as &quot;the power-up&quot;. The original game idea was to have an always big Mario as a technical advance, but later the power-up was introduced to make him &quot;super&quot; as a bonus effect. The development team thought it would be interesting to have Mario grow and shrink by eating a magic mushroom, just like in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. Other power-ups introduced in this game were the Super Stars and Fire Flowers, which gave Mario invincibility and the ability to shoot fireballs at enemies, respectively.

Konami&#x27;s 1985 game &quot;Gradius&quot; had the first use of a selection bar where the player could select which power-up effect to trigger, instead of having a fixed instant effect.

In 1986 and the years after, the concept of permanent power-ups appeared in the action role-playing genre in the form of &quot;perks&quot;.

==Types of power-ups==
Power-ups can be classified according to the type of benefit they give the player.

===Offensive abilities===
Power-ups can give players a new weapon, or transform the player character into a more aggressive form that increases its attack power or makes some enemies vulnerable. This also includes &quot;nukes&quot;, which are weapons that destroy every enemy on the screen at once; these are prevalent in many different genres including vehicular combat, run and guns, and platform games. The effect of the power-up can be time-limited, have a limited number of uses, last until the player is hit, last until the player is killed, or last until game over.

Examples:
* &quot;Mega Man&quot; series: Weapons are earned from the Robot Masters/Mavericks upon defeating them. The weapons are kept until the game is turned off (unless a password is used which can bring the player back to a point after the weapon was acquired) or when the game is completed.
* &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;: The hammer that Mario (Jumpman) can use to destroy barrels and fireballs.
* &quot;Pac-Man&quot;: Power pellets can be picked up by Pac-Man, allowing him to attack ghosts. This also makes Pac-Man temporarily invulnerable.
* &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;: The player can smash overhead bricks by jumping into them after picking up a Super Mushroom, and can throw fireballs at enemies after picking up a Fire Flower. In addition to those two, there are ice flowers, mini mushrooms, mega mushrooms, hammer power, etc. Mario loses the Super Mario effect after being hit; if he has also collected a Fire Flower, then this is lost along with it.
* &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot;: In the first game, collecting Red Eco increases Jak&#x27;s attack power, while Yellow Eco gives the ability to shoot fireballs from his hands. In the next two games, Dark Eco can be used to transform into Dark Jak, giving a more powerful melee attack, and access to additional unlockable abilities.
* &quot;Doom&quot;: In secret areas, the player can find Berserk packs that greatly increases the damage from Doomguy&#x27;s fist, allowing him to kill most of the weaker enemies in one or two hits without spending any ammunition

===Defensive abilities===
Defensive power-ups typically consist of items like &quot;shields&quot; (usually a &quot;force field&quot;) surrounding the character that deflects projectiles or absorbs a certain amount of damage, or invincibility/invulnerability. In the case of invincibility, this is nearly always granted as a temporary bonus; otherwise it would negate the challenge of the game.

Invincibility (or &quot;invulnerability&quot;) comes in two main forms: either the player character merely becomes intangible to harmful things, or can also damage enemies by contact. In either case the character is often still vulnerable to some threats, such as bottomless pits. In many games, invulnerability is also temporarily granted after the player gets hit or loses a life, so that the character will not be hurt/killed twice in quick succession. The effect is commonly indicated by making the player character flash or blink or by musical cues.

Examples:
* &quot;Mario&quot;: The Starman, which grants temporary invulnerability and the ability to defeat enemies by touch.
* &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;: There are several kinds of defensive power-ups in the &quot;Sonic&quot; franchise. The first game introduced the Shield, which would protect Sonic from being hit one time. This would prevent the player from losing Rings and lives, enclosing Sonic in a spherical barrier. There are several variations of this item as well, including the Thunder/Magnetic, Aqua/Water, and Fire/Flame Shields. These games also feature the Invincibility box which grants temporary invulnerability, and the ability to defeat enemies by simply touching them.
* &quot;Blur&quot;: This game also features defensive power-ups like shield and repair to prevent the player&#x27;s car from getting wrecked. Some power-ups can be fired backwards to destroy opponents behind the player.
* &quot;Clash of Clans&quot;: The Grand Warden&#x27;s Eternal Tome ability makes all surrounding friendly units with a certain range to be invulnerable to damage from defense towers fordepending on the level3.5, 4, 4.5 or 5 seconds at ability levels 1, 2, 3 or 4, respectively.
* &quot;Splatoon&quot; series: The Armor power-up coats the player in one layer of armor and prevents enemy attacks from &quot;splatting&quot; the player. If the player takes enough damage that would otherwise splat them, a layer of armor breaks while the player is restored to full health and given a short period of invulnerability. Unlike most defensive power-ups, the player can have multiple layers of armor at once.

===Evasive abilities===
Some power-ups consist of items which help the player avoid or escape enemies or enemy weapons. This category includes &quot;speed boosts&quot; and other power-ups which affect time, which can be temporary, permanent, or cumulative, and &quot;invisibility&quot; power-ups which help the player avoid enemies.

Examples:
* &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot;: The shoe power-up, which makes the player character move more quickly.
* &quot;R-Type&quot;: The &#x27;S&#x27; icon, which increases the player&#x27;s speed every time one is collected.
* &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;, &quot;Quake I &amp; II&quot;: The Invisibility power-up, which turns the player into an indistinct wireframe or shadow. Similarly, radiation suits serve to deflect certain types of weapons as well.
* &quot;Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII&quot;: The Dash materia, which allows Zack to move at double speed to help avoid enemy attacks.
* &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot;: The Blue Eco, which enables Jak to run faster and jump higher. It is also used to activate the ancient Precursor machinery found throughout the world, opening doors and activating floating platforms. Due to this, Blue Eco can also be considered an Access ability.
* &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;: The Power Sneakers/Speed Shoes item in this series temporarily increases the speed, accelerations and jump height of the player character.
* &quot;Super Metroid&quot;: The Speed Booster is a permanent power-up that gives Samus Aran the ability to run incredibly fast, destroying any enemy in her path. She can also perform a technique with the Speed Booster called the &quot;Shinespark&quot;, which allows her to do an invincible charge in 6 possible directions, at the cost of draining health.

===Access abilities===
Some power-ups help the player enter new or previously inaccessible areas, or &quot;warp&quot; to another level. Access abilities, depending on the game, can be required to progress normally or be entirely optional.

Examples:
* &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;: The warp whistle, which allows player to first go to a warp zone, then advance to another world of a higher value, and the hammer, which allows players to take shortcuts on the overworld game map. Mario also acquires a Raccoon Leaf which allows him to fly, sometimes to hidden areas.
* &quot;Mega Man&quot; series: The Rush power-ups, which allow the player to attain power-ups not possible by any other means. The most common are Rush Jet, Rush Coil, Rush Marine, and Rush Search. Also notable are some of the capsule upgrades in the &quot;X&quot; spin-off series.
* &quot;Metroid&quot; series: Various weapons (such as the Ice Beam and the Power Bomb) are permanent power-ups that not only give Samus Aran additional offensive capability but also allow her access to various doors.

===Health and life reserves===
Health-restorative power-ups typically consist of items which restore lost health (most typically in medical kits, food, or as energy), or items which increase health capacity and 1-ups (which give an extra chance to continue playing after losing, commonly called a &#x27;life&#x27;).

Examples:
* &quot;Mario&quot;: The &quot;Super Mushrooms&quot; and 1-up Mushrooms give Mario the ability to take an extra hit and extra lives (respectively).
* &quot;Wonder Boy&quot;: Fruits recharge the continuously dwindling player energy.
* &quot;Doom&quot;: First aid kits restore part of the player&#x27;s health.
* &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;: The heart containers permanently increase the player&#x27;s total health capacity, while heart power ups each refill one heart container worth of lost health.
* &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot;: Green Eco, the most common type of Eco in the game, restores Jak&#x27;s health.
* &quot;Clash of Clans&quot;: The Healing Spell causes all friendly troops (ground or air) to regain some health depending on the level each pulse (for forty pulses) in 12 seconds.
* &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;: The Extra Life box, represented in earlier games with an icon of the character the player is controlling, and in later titles by an icon reading &quot;1-up&quot;, grants an extra life whenever it is collected.

===Ammunition and power reserves===
In some games, using certain items or abilities requires the expenditure of a resource such as ammunition, fuel or magic points. Some games use a single resource, such as magic points, while others use multiple resources, such as several types of ammunition. Some games also have power ups which increase the player&#x27;s maximum ammunition or power capacity.

Examples:
* &quot;Half-Life&quot;: Ammunition for guns.
* &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;: Obtaining &quot;Magic Jars&quot; restores magic points, which are expended by many items and other special abilities.
* &quot;Descent 2&quot;: Energy power-ups restore energy, which is required to fire most primary weapons, and to use some other equipment such as the headlight and afterburner.
* &quot;Mega Man&quot;: While the default weapon has an unlimited number of shots, the other six weapons can only be fired by expending &#x27;weapon energy&#x27;, of which each weapon has its own separate reserve. Obtaining a &#x27;weapon capsule&#x27; recharges a portion of the currently selected weapon&#x27;s energy.
* &quot;Monster Legends&quot;: Monsters have a certain number of energy points depending on their rarity. Making a move costs some energy, which must be replenished at the cost of a turn (or by using special moves that give some energy points back to the user, or the whole team).

===Token abilities===
Other power-ups consist of items whose main feature is that they are found in large numbers, to encourage the player to reach certain spots in the game world. They have various cumulative effects, often granting the hero an extra life.

Examples:
* &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;: Collecting 100 coins grants the player an extra life.
* &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;: Collecting 5 cherries causes a Starman powerup to float up from the bottom of the screen.
* &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;: Collecting at least one ring lets the player take a hit at the cost of losing all rings. Collecting 100 rings grants the player an extra life.
** Additionally, in many games in the series, acquiring all seven Chaos Emeralds and collecting at least 50 rings allows the player to activate Super Sonic mode, which grants flight, increased speed and invulnerability to most forms of damage, but gradually consuming rings over time, and expires when the player runs out of rings.
* &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot;: Collecting 100 Wumpa fruits grants the player an extra life.
* &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;: Collecting 100 bananas grants the player an extra life.

===Trick power-ups (or power-downs)===
Trick power-ups try to trick the player into grabbing them, only to result usually into damage, removed abilities, or player death.

Examples:
* &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels&quot;: Poison mushroom.
* &quot;Bonk&#x27;s Revenge&quot;: Fake power-up containers that actually release an enemy.
* &quot;Sonic 3&quot;/&quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;/&quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot;: Item Monitors that bear Eggman/Robotnik on them will cause Sonic to be hurt if he opens them.
* &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot;: Some Energy or Missile Tanks are actually enemies in disguise, and usually lead to a room with the real power-up.
* &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot;: Items like the Shrooms and Elasto reduces the player control.

==Attaining power-ups==
There are many different methods of obtaining power-ups:
* In many games, particularly platform games, there is one prevalent object scattered throughout each level that serves as a container for power-ups. In series such as the &quot;Castlevania&quot; and &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; games this object is a candle or lantern, while in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise, the oft-used container is the &quot;question block&quot;. In the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series, the power-ups in the 2D titles are usually found in cubic static TVs (named &quot;monitors&quot;), while in 3D games they are enclosed in capsule-like boxes.
* In beat &#x27;em up games, level-themed objects such as crates, barrels, or mailboxes serve as containers.
* In many games, such as the &quot;Mega Man&quot; series, power-ups can be obtained through the elimination of enemies.
* In some games, power-ups may be left within plain view, such as in &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot;. It is also typical for games to require the player to travel a certain way or perform a specific action in order to attain said power-up, such as bombing through specific blocks in &quot;Super Metroid&quot;.
* Power-ups can also be obtained by interacting with certain objects at specific points in the level, e.g. the tractor-trailer truck in &quot;Spy Hunter&quot;.

===Treasure chests===
In many video games, especially role-playing video games, treasure chests contain various items, currency, and sometimes monsters. For certain role playing games, some chests are actually mimics, in which a monster looks like a chest, but will attack the player when they attempt to open it. This is notably seen in the &quot;Seiken Densetsu&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series.

Treasure chests provide a means for the player to obtain items without paying for them in stores. In some cases, these chests contain items that cannot be purchased at stores. Chests may be locked, requiring a key of some sort. For certain games, keys can only be used once, and the key is destroyed during its use. For other games, having a particular type of key means that the player can open any of the chests with a matching lock.

For most games, once a chest has been opened, the contents remain empty, although they may be repopulated with possibly different items during different stages of the game. This is different from perishable containers, such as crates and jars, which tend to reappear if the player exits the area and then returns.

===Selection bar===

Instead of having players collect a power-up that is instantly activated, the players may be allowed to select which power-ups they want to use. This is commonly implemented through a &#x27;selection bar&#x27; which contains a number of power-up effects. To access the bar, the player must collect power-up items; the more they collect, the further along the bar they can access. The more powerful power-ups are traditionally placed further along the bar, so that more effort is required to obtain them. The selection bar was first used in Konami&#x27;s 1985 game, &quot;Gradius&quot;.

===Perks===

&quot;Perks&quot; are a variation of the power-up mechanic, but permanent rather than temporary. The concept of permanent power-ups dates back to the early NES action RPGs, &quot;Deadly Towers&quot; (1986) and &quot;Rygar&quot; (1987), which blurred the line between the power-ups used in action-adventures and the experience points used in console RPGs. An early video game that used perks, and named it as such, was the 1997 computer RPG game &quot;Fallout&quot;. Perks have been used in various other video games in recent times, including first-person shooters such as &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot;, &quot;Modern Warfare 2&quot;, and &quot;Killing Floor&quot;, as well as action games like &quot;Metal Gear Online&quot;.

<text>Germanite is a rare copper iron germanium sulfide mineral, Cu26Fe4Ge4S32. It was first discovered in 1922, and named for its germanium content. It is only a minor source of this important semiconductor element, which is mainly derived from the processing of the zinc sulfide mineral sphalerite. Germanite contains gallium, zinc, molybdenum, arsenic, and vanadium as impurities.

Its type locality is the Tsumeb Mine in Namibia where it occurs in a hydrothermal polymetallic ore deposit in dolomite in association with renierite, pyrite, tennantite, enargite, galena, sphalerite, digenite, bornite and chalcopyrite. It has also been reported from Argentina, Armenia, Bulgaria, Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo (Zaire), Finland, France, Greece, Japan, Republic of Congo (Brazzaville), Russia and the United States.

<doc id="252059" wikidata="Q968198" url="?curid=252059" title="Chiniquodon">
<text>Chiniquodon is an extinct genus of carnivorous cynodonts, which lived during the Late Triassic (Carnian) in South America (Argentina and Brazil) and Africa (Namibia and Madagascar). &quot;Chiniquodon&quot; was closely related to the genus &quot;Aleodon&quot;, and close to the ancestry of mammals.

Other contemporaries included early dinosaurs. As both groups filled a similar ecological niche, fairly large therapsid hunters such as &quot;Chiniquodon&quot; may have been outcompeted by dinosaurs.

== Classification ==
&quot;Chiniquodon theotonicus&quot;, the type species, is from the Santa Maria Formation, Brazil and Chañares Formation, Ischigualasto-Villa Unión Basin, northwestern Argentina. This species is known from a number of skulls. The holotype is in the paleontological collection at Tübingen University, Germany.

&quot;Chiniquodon kitchingi&quot;, from the Santa Maria Formation of Brazil, was described in 1982 by A. M. Sá-Teixeira based on a single skull missing the lower jaw. When first described, it was assigned to the genus &quot;Probelesodon&quot;, but was reassigned to &quot;Chiniquodon&quot; in a 1995 paper by Fernando Abdala, as the type species of &quot;Probelesodon&quot; (&quot;P. lewisi&quot;) was found to be a junior synonym of &quot;C. theotonicus&quot;. A 2002 paper by Abdala and Norberto P. Giannini went even further by synonymising &quot;C. kitchingi&quot; with &quot;C. theotonicus&quot;. In 2023 the type material of &quot;C. kitchingi&quot; was redescribed by Hoffmann &quot;et al.&quot;, who found it to be a valid species of &quot;Chiniquodon&quot;.

&quot;Chiniquodon sanjuanensis&quot; is from the Cancha de Bochas Member of the Ischigualasto Formation, Ischigualasto-Villa Unión Basin, northwestern Argentina. It was originally assigned to the genus &quot;Probelesodon&quot;, but was reassigned to &quot;Chiniquodon&quot; in 2002. It is differentiated from &quot;C. theotonicus&quot; because of its teeth and the shape of the zygomatic process.

&quot;Chiniquodon kalanoro&quot; is from the Isalo II Formation, Madagascar. This species is known from a mandible (holotype UA 10607).

&quot;Chiniquodon omaruruensis&quot; is from the Omingonde Formation of Namibia. It is known from a single specimen (GSN F315), consisting of a complete skull and parts of the postcranial skeleton.

<text>Zola Budd (also known as Zola Pieterse; born 26 May 1966) is a South African middle-distance and long-distance runner. She competed at the 1984 Olympic Games for Great Britain and the 1992 Olympic Games for South Africa, both times in the 3000 metres. In 1984 (unratified) and 1985, she broke the world record in the 5000 metres. She was also a two-time winner at the World Cross Country Championships (1985–1986). Budd mainly trained and raced barefoot. Her mile best of 4:17.57 in 1985 stood as the British record for 38 years until Laura Muir ran 4:15.24 on 21 July 2023.

She returned to South Africa in 1989, and represented South Africa at the 1992 Summer Olympics. She moved with her family to South Carolina, USA in 2008; and competed at marathons and ultramarathons. She moved back to South Africa in 2020–2021.

== Athletics career ==
===5000 metres world record===
Budd, who was born in Bloemfontein, Orange Free State, South Africa, achieved fame in early 1984, at the age of 17, when she broke the 5000 m world record with a time of 15:01.83. Since her performance took place in South Africa, then excluded from international athletics competition because of its segregation policy, the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) refused to ratify Budd&#x27;s time as an official world record.

In 1985, she claimed the world record officially, while representing Great Britain, clocking 14:48.07.

===Arrival in Britain===
The &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, a British tabloid newspaper, persuaded Budd&#x27;s father to encourage her to apply for registration as a British citizen, on the grounds that her grandfather was British, to circumvent the international sporting boycott of South Africa, so that she could compete in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. With a strong push from the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, registration as a British citizen was granted in short order and she moved to Guildford. Her application and arrival was controversial due to her acquiring a passport so quickly. Groups supporting the abolition of apartheid campaigned to highlight the rapid treatment she received; applicants for naturalisation typically had to wait years for their applications to be considered.

Shortly afterwards, Budd was forced to pull out of a 1500 metres race in Crawley, Sussex, when the town council withdrew their invitation at short notice. The race was part of the inaugural event for the town&#x27;s new Bewbush Leisure Centre and Mayor Alf Pegler said members of the council had expressed misgivings that the local significance of the event would be overshadowed by &quot;political connotations and anti-apartheid demonstrators&quot;.

She ran her first competitive race on the cinder track at Central Park in Dartford, Kent, covering 3000 m in 9:02.6 in a race shown live on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Grandstand&quot;. She ran in further races in Britain, including the UK Championships 1500 m (won in 4:04) and the 3000 m in the UK Olympic trials, which she won in 8:40, earning a place on the British Olympic team. In the 2000 m at Crystal Palace in July 1984 she set a new world record of 5:33.15. Commenting during the race for the BBC, David Coleman exclaimed, &quot;The message will now be flashed around the world – Zola Budd is no myth.&quot;

In Britain, Budd trained at Aldershot, Farnham and District Athletics Club.

===1984 Olympic 3000 metres===

In the 1984 Olympics, held in Los Angeles, California, the media billed the 3000 m race as a duel between Budd and world champion Mary Decker of USA. However, experts expected that Decker&#x27;s main competition would be Romanian Maricica Puică, who had set the fastest time that year.

Decker set a fast pace from the gun with Budd in close pursuit, followed by Puică and Britain&#x27;s Wendy Sly. When the pace slowed just past the midway point, Budd took the lead on the straight and ran wide of the pack around the turn. Setting the pace, she took herself, Decker, Sly and Puică clear of the pack. Running as a group was an unusual situation for Budd and Decker, both of whom were used to running in front and well ahead of other competitors.

At 1700 metres, the first collision occurred. Decker came into contact with one of Budd&#x27;s legs, knocking Budd slightly off balance. However, both women maintained their close position. Five strides on, at race time of 4:58, Budd and Decker again made contact, with Budd&#x27;s left foot brushing Decker&#x27;s thigh, causing Budd to lose her balance and sending her into Decker&#x27;s path. Decker&#x27;s spiked running shoe came down hard into Budd&#x27;s ankle, just above the heel, drawing blood. Videotapes later examined by Olympic officials showed Budd visibly in pain. However, she maintained equilibrium and kept stride.

Decker stepped on Budd; then, shortly after, she collided with the British runner and fell to the curb, injuring her hip. The fall ended her race, and she was carried off the track in tears by her boyfriend (and later, husband), British discus thrower Richard Slaney.

Budd, deeply affected by the occurrence, continued to lead for a while, but faded, finishing seventh. Her finishing time of 8:48 was well outside her best of 8:37. Budd tried to apologise to Decker in the tunnel after the race, but Decker was upset, and replied, &quot;Don’t bother!&quot; Puică won, with Sly second, and Canada&#x27;s Lynn Williams third.

An International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) jury found that she was not responsible for the collision. Decker said many years after the event: &quot;The reason I fell, some people think she tripped me deliberately. I happen to know that wasn&#x27;t the case at all. The reason I fell is because I am and was very inexperienced in running in a pack.&quot;

In general, it is the trailing athlete&#x27;s responsibility to avoid contact with the runner ahead; whether or not Budd had sufficient control of the race to have pulled into the curve as she did was hotly disputed. &quot;This doesn&#x27;t mean,&quot; track journalist Kenny Moore wrote in the aftermath, &quot;that a leader can swerve in with impunity, but that in the give and take of pack running, athletes learn to make allowances.&quot;

In 2002, the moment was ranked 93rd in Channel 4&#x27;s 100 Greatest Sporting Moments. On an episode of &quot;Celebrity Come Dine with Me&quot;, Budd stated that she had never seen footage of the collision. Budd and Decker later reunited for a 2016 documentary about the incident, &quot;The Fall&quot;.

===International competition===
Budd competed internationally for the UK in 1985 and 1986. In February 1985, she was World Cross Country Champion (beating Ingrid Kristiansen), but then went on to several track defeats. The most significant of these was her rematch with Mary Decker-Slaney at Crystal Palace in July 1985, in which she finished fourth, some 13 seconds behind Decker-Slaney.

Budd&#x27;s form improved significantly after this race, however, as she then went on to break the UK and Commonwealth records for the 1500 m (in 3:59.96), the mile (4:17.57), the 3000m (8:28.83) and the 5000m (14:48.07). This last reduced the world record by ten seconds. She was also victor in the European Cup 3000m. Her best times in the 1500m, mile run and 3000m were set in races with Decker-Slaney and Maricica Puică. Budd finished third in all three races, with Decker-Slaney and Puică consistently coming first and second, respectively.

1986 began with a defence of her World Cross Country title and a world indoor 3000m record of 8:39.79. However, after a couple of victories in fast early season times over 1500m (4:01.93) and 3000m (8:34.72), her outdoor track season brought several defeats by athletes she should have beaten easily. She competed in both the 1500m and 3000m at the European Championships but did not win a medal in either, finishing 9th and 4th, respectively. It later emerged that Budd was suffering a painful leg injury for much of the season; she did not compete in 1987 as she sought treatment for this.

== Personal life ==
===Suspension, return to South Africa and marriage===
In 1988, Budd began to compete again with a handful of cross-country runs. However, several African nations claimed she had competed in an event in South Africa, which, at the time, was prohibited by IAAF rule 53i because of South Africa’s policy of apartheid, and insisted she be suspended from competition. Budd said she only attended the event and did not compete. The IAAF upheld the charge, stating:

Budd was suspended, at which point she returned to South Africa, and retired from international competition for several years.

In 1989, Budd married Mike Pieterse. The couple have three children. Also in 1989, Budd published her autobiography, &quot;Zola&quot; (co-written with Hugh Eley). 

On her return to South Africa, Budd began racing again. She had an excellent season in 1991 and was the second-fastest woman in the world over 3000m. Following South Africa&#x27;s re-admission to international sport, she competed in the 3000m at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona but did not qualify for the final. In 1993, she finished fourth at the World Cross Country championships but would never translate this form on to the track. 

Budd remains the holder of numerous British and South African records at junior and senior levels, and still holds two junior world records: the mile and 3000m.

===Relocation to U.S.===

Following allegations of her husband having an affair, Budd, under her married name Pieterse, and her three children relocated to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, US, in August 2008; her husband joined them later. She initially had a two-year visa that allowed her to compete on the US masters&#x27; circuit. She raced in the South Carolina division of USA Track and Field, winning the women&#x27;s division of the Dasani Half-Marathon during Bi-Lo Myrtle Beach Marathon on 14 February 2009 with a time of 1:20:41.

On 12 January 2012, she announced her participation in the 2012 edition of the nearly Comrades (ultra)Marathon which was held on 3 June 2012. She would also participate in the Two Oceans Marathon during the Easter weekend of 2012 as she trained towards the Comrades Marathon which she ended up finishing in 8:06:09 (she was the 37th female finisher), earning a Bill Rowan Medal. Although she planned to also run the Comrades in 2013 she withdrew due to illness.

In June 2014, Budd entered the Comrades again, hoping for an overall silver medal and for a time under 7 hours 30 minutes (7:30:00). Budd beat her time target, finishing with a time of 6:55:55 and earning a gold medal for a top 10 finish as well as a gold medal as the 1st &#x27;veteran&#x27; (senior) finisher while coming in as the 7th female finisher overall (the first six being at least 10 years her junior). Budd dedicated her 2014 Comrades run to South African teacher Pierre Korkie, held captive in Yemen by Al-Qaeda for one year. She was stripped of her &#x27;veteran&#x27; gold medal (but not of her cash prize for finishing 7th overall) following accusations that she did not display a small age category tag on her running vest, in addition to the veteran designation already displayed on her running bib. Budd and her coach pointed out that the veteran gold medal and silver medal were then given to two runners who also did not have the small age category tag on their running vests, and announced in September 2014 that they had started court proceedings against the Comrades Marathon Association to have her veteran win reinstated.

In March 2015, Budd won the Run Hard Columbia (SC) Marathon in a time of 3:05:27.

As of July 2020, she was an Assistant Cross Country and Girls Track Coach at Conway High School in Conway, South Carolina; and volunteered as assistant coach at Coastal Carolina University, also in Conway.

She moved back to South Africa in 2021.

==Cultural impact==
In South Africa today, township taxis are nicknamed &quot;Zola Budd&quot; for their speed. The singer Brenda Fassie (whom &quot;Time&quot; magazine called &quot;the Madonna of the townships&quot; in 2001) had a hit single in the 1980s with her track &quot;Zola Budd&quot;.
On 20 July 2012 BBC Radio 4 broadcast a play about the political and media actions taken to bring Zola Budd to Britain with her father at the age of 17, the script implying she was unwilling and homesick.

<text>Yang Chen-Ning or Chen-Ning Yang (; born 1 October 1922), also known as C. N. Yang or by the English name Frank Yang, is a Chinese theoretical physicist who made significant contributions to statistical mechanics, integrable systems, gauge theory, and both particle physics and condensed matter physics. He and Tsung-Dao Lee received the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on parity non-conservation of weak interaction. The two proposed that the conservation of parity, a physical law observed to hold in all other physical processes, is violated in the so-called weak nuclear reactions, those nuclear processes that result in the emission of beta or alpha particles. Yang is also well known for his collaboration with Robert Mills in developing non-abelian gauge theory, widely known as the Yang–Mills theory.

== Early life and education ==
Yang was born in Hefei, Anhui, China. His father, (; 1896–1973), was a mathematician, and his mother, Meng Hwa Loh Yang (), was a housewife. 

Yang attended elementary school and high school in Beijing, and in the autumn of 1937 his family moved to Hefei after the Japanese invaded China. In 1938 they moved to Kunming, Yunnan, where National Southwestern Associated University was located. In the same year, as a second-year student, Yang passed the entrance examination and studied at National Southwestern Associated University. He received a Bachelor of Science in 1942, with his thesis on the application of group theory to molecular spectra, under the supervision of Ta-You Wu. 

Yang continued to study graduate courses there for two years under the supervision of Wang Zhuxi, working on statistical mechanics. In 1944, he received a Master of Science from Tsinghua University, which had moved to Kunming during the Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). Yang was then awarded a scholarship from the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program, set up by the United States government using part of the money China had been forced to pay following the Boxer Rebellion. His departure for the United States was delayed for one year, during which time he taught in a middle school as a teacher and studied field theory.

Yang entered the University of Chicago in January 1946 and studied with Edward Teller. He received a Doctor of Philosophy in 1948.

== Career ==
Yang remained at the University of Chicago for a year as an assistant to Enrico Fermi. In 1949 he was invited to do his research at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he began a period of fruitful collaboration with Tsung-Dao Lee. He was made a permanent member of the Institute in 1952, and full professor in 1955. In 1963, Princeton University Press published his textbook, &quot;Elementary Particles&quot;. In 1965 he moved to Stony Brook University, where he was named the Albert Einstein Professor of Physics and the first director of the newly founded Institute for Theoretical Physics. Today this institute is known as the C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics.

Yang retired from Stony Brook University in 1999, assuming the title Emeritus Professor. In 2010, Stony Brook University honored Yang&#x27;s contributions to the university by naming its newest dormitory building C. N. Yang Hall.

Yang has been elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Academia Sinica, the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Royal Society. He was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the United States National Academy of Sciences. He was awarded honorary doctorate degrees by Princeton University (1958), Moscow State University (1992), and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (1997).

Yang visited the Chinese mainland in 1971 for the first time after the thaw in China–US relations, and has subsequently worked to help the Chinese physics community rebuild the research atmosphere which was destroyed by the radical political movements during the Cultural Revolution. After retiring from Stony Brook, he returned as an honorary director of Tsinghua University, Beijing, where he is the Huang Jibei-Lu Kaiqun Professor at the Center for Advanced Study (CASTU). He is also one of the two Shaw Prize Founding Members and is a Distinguished Professor-at-Large at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Yang helped to establish the Theoretical Physics Division at the Chern Institute of Mathematics in 1986 at the request of Shiing-Shen Chern who was serving as the inaugural director of the Institute at the time.

Yang was the first president of the Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies (AAPPS) when it was established in 1989. In 1997 the AAPPS created the C.N. Yang Award in his honor to highlight young researchers.

== Personal life ==
Yang married Tu Chih-li (), a teacher, in 1950; they had two sons and a daughter together. His father-in-law was the Kuomintang general Du Yuming. Tu died in October 2003. In January 2005, Yang married Weng Fan (, a university student. They met in 1995 at a physics seminar; the couple reestablished contact in February 2004. Yang called Weng, who is 54 years his junior, his &quot;final blessing from God&quot;. Yang formally renounced his U.S. citizenship in late 2015.

On 1 October 2022, Yang became a centenarian.

== Academic achievements ==
Yang has worked on statistical mechanics, condensed matter theory, particle physics and gauge theory/quantum field theory.

At the University of Chicago, Yang first spent twenty months working in an accelerator lab, but he later found he was not as good as an experimentalist and switched back to theory. His doctoral thesis was about angular distribution in nuclear reactions. 

Yang is well known for his 1953 collaboration with Robert Mills in developing non-abelian gauge theory, widely known as the Yang–Mills theory. The idea was generally conceived by Yang, and the novice scientist Mills assisted him in this endeavor as Mills said:During the academic year 1953-1954, Yang was a visitor to Brookhaven National Laboratory...I was at Brookhaven also...and was assigned to the same office as Yang. Yang, who has demonstrated on a number of occasions his generosity to physicists beginning their careers, told me about his idea of generalizing gauge invariance and we discussed it at some length...I was able to contribute something to the discussions, especially with regard to the quantization procedures, and to a small degree in working out the formalism; however, the key ideas were Yang&#x27;s.
The Yang-Mills theory was called by The Scientist:
The foundation for current understanding of how subatomic particles interact, a contribution which has restructured modern physics and mathematics.
Subsequently, in the last three decades, many other prominent scientists have developed key breakthroughs to what is now known as gauge theory. 

Later, Yang worked on particle phenomenology; a well-known work was the Fermi–Yang model treating pion meson as a bound nucleon–anti-nucleon pair. In 1956, he and Tsung Dao (T.D.) Lee proposed that in the weak interaction the parity symmetry was not conserved, Chien-shiung Wu&#x27;s team at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington experimentally verified the theory. Yang and Lee received the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics for their parity violation theory, which brought revolutionary change to the field of particle physics. Yang has also worked on neutrino theory with Tsung Dao (T.D.) Lee, 1957, 1959, CT nonconservation (with Tsung Dao (T.D.) Lee and R. Oheme, 1957), electromagnetic interaction of vector mesons (with Tsung Dao (T.D.) Lee, 1962), CP nonconservation with Tai Tsun Wu (1964).

In the 1970s Yang worked on the topological properties of gauge theory, collaborating with Wu Tai-Tsun to elucidate the Wu–Yang monopole. Unlike the Dirac monopole, it has no singular Dirac string. 

Yang has had a great interest in statistical mechanics since his undergraduate time. In the 1950s and 1960s, he collaborated with Tsung Dao (T.D.) Lee and Kerson Huang, etc. and studied statistical mechanics and condensed matter theory. He studied the theory of phase transition and elucidated the Lee–Yang circle theorem, properties of quantum boson liquid, two dimensional Ising model, flux quantization in superconductors (with N. Byers, 1961), and proposed the concept of Off-Diagonal Long-Range Order (ODLRO, 1962). In 1967, he found a consistent condition for a one-dimensional factorized scattering many-body system, the equation was later named the Yang–Baxter equation, it plays an important role in integrable models and has influenced several branches of physics and mathematics.

<doc id="252063" wikidata="Q1189753" url="?curid=252063" title="Denotation">
<text>In linguistics and philosophy, the denotation of a word or expression is its strictly literal meaning. For instance, the English word &quot;warm&quot; denotes the property of having high temperature. Denotation is contrasted with other aspects of meaning including &quot;connotation&quot;. For instance, the word &quot;warm&quot; may evoke calmness, coziness, or kindness (as in the warmth of someone&#x27;s personality) but these associations are not part of the word&#x27;s denotation. Similarly, an expression&#x27;s denotation is separate from pragmatic inferences it may trigger. For instance, describing something as &quot;warm&quot; often implicates that it is not hot, but this is once again not part of the word&#x27;s denotation.

Denotation plays a major role in several fields. Within semantics and philosophy of language, denotation is studied as an important aspect of meaning. In mathematics and computer science, assignments of denotations are assigned to expressions are a crucial step in defining interpreted formal languages. The main task of formal semantics is to reverse engineer the computational system which assigns denotations to expressions of natural languages.

== In linguistic semantics ==

In natural language semantics, denotations are conceived of as the outputs of the semantic component of the grammar. For example, the denotation of the word &quot;blue&quot; is the property of being blue and the denotation of the word &quot;Barack Obama&quot; is the person who goes by that name. Phrases also have denotations which are computed according to the principle of compositionality. For instance, the verb phrase &quot;passed the class&quot; denotes the property of having passed the class. Depending on one&#x27;s particular theory of semantics, denotations may be identified either with terms&#x27; extensions, intensions, or other structures such as context change potentials.

When uttered in discourse, expressions may convey other associations which are not computed by the grammar and thus are not part of its denotation. For instance, depending on the context, saying &quot;I ran five miles&quot; may convey that you ran exactly five miles and not more. This content is not part of the sentence&#x27;s denotation but rather pragmatic inferences arrived at by applying social cognition to its denotation.

== Denotation, meaning, and reference ==
Linguistic discussion of the differences between denotation, meaning, and reference is rooted in the work of Ferdinand de Saussure, specifically in his theory of semiotics written in the book Course in General Linguistics. Philosophers Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell have also made influential contributions to this subject.

=== Denotation and reference ===
Although they have similar meanings, denotation should not be confused with reference. A reference is a specific person, place, or thing that a speaker identifies when using a word. Vocabulary from John Searle&#x27;s speech act theory can be used to define this relationship. According to this theory, the speaker&#x27;s action of identifying a person, place, or thing is called referring. The specific person, place, or thing identified by the speaker is called the referent. Reference itself captures the relationship between the referent and the word or phrase used by the speaker. For referring expressions, the denotation of the phrase is most likely the phrase&#x27;s referent. For content words, the denotation of the word can refer to any object, real or imagined, to which the word could be applied.

=== Denotation and meaning ===
In &quot;On Sense and Reference&quot;, philosopher Gottlob Frege began the conversation about distinctions between meaning and denotation when he evaluated words like the German words &quot;Morgenstern&quot; and &quot;Abendstern&quot;. Author Thomas Herbst uses the words &quot;kid&quot; and &quot;child&quot; to illustrate the same concept. According to Herbst, these two words have the same denotation, as they have the same member set; however, &quot;kid&quot; may be used in an informal speech situation whereas &quot;child&quot; may be used in a more formal speech situation.

==In other fields==
* In computer science, denotational semantics is contrasted with operational semantics.
*In media studies terminology, denotation is an example of the first level of analysis: what the audience can visually see on a page. Denotation often refers to something literal, and avoids being a metaphor. Here it is usually coupled with connotation which is the second level of analysis, being what the denotation represents.

<doc id="252064" wikidata="Q422863" url="?curid=252064" title="Stercobilin">
<text>Stercobilin is a tetrapyrrolic bile pigment and is one end-product of heme catabolism. It is the chemical responsible for the brown color of human feces and was originally isolated from feces in 1932. Stercobilin (and related urobilin) can be used as a marker for biochemical identification of fecal pollution levels in rivers.

== Metabolism ==
Stercobilin results from breakdown of the heme moiety of hemoglobin found in erythrocytes (red blood cells). Macrophages break down senescent erythrocytes and break the heme down into biliverdin, which rapidly reduces to free bilirubin. Bilirubin binds tightly to plasma proteins (especially albumin) in the blood stream and is transported to the liver, where it is conjugated with one or two glucuronic acid residues into bilirubin diglucuronide, and secreted into the small intestine as bile. In the small intestine, some bilirubin glucuronide is converted back to bilirubin via bacterial enzymes in the terminal ileum. This bilirubin is further converted to colorless urobilinogen by the bacterial enzyme bilirubin reductase. Urobilinogen that remains in the colon can either be reduced to stercobilinogen and finally oxidized to stercobilin, or it can be directly reduced to stercobilin. Stercobilin is responsible for the brown color of human feces. Stercobilin is then excreted in the feces.

== Role in disease ==

===Obstructive jaundice===
In obstructive jaundice, no bilirubin reaches the small intestine, meaning that there is no formation of stercobilinogen. The lack of stercobilin and other bile pigments causes feces to become clay-colored.

===Brown pigment gallstones===
An analysis of two infants suffering from cholelithiasis observed that a substantial amount of stercobilin was present in brown pigment gallstones. This study suggested that brown pigment gallstones could form spontaneously in infants suffering from bacterial infections of the biliary tract.

== Role in treatment of disease ==
A 1996 study by McPhee et al. suggested that stercobilin and other related pyrrolic pigments — including urobilin, biliverdin, and xanthobilirubic acid — has potential to function as a new class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors when delivered at low micromolar concentrations. These pigments were selected due to a similarity in shape to the successful HIV-1 protease inhibitor Merck L-700,417 (&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-bis(2-hydroxy-1-indanyl)-2,6-diphenylmethyl-4-hydroxy-1,7-heptandiamide). Further research is suggested to study the pharmacological efficacy of these pigments.

<text>Merv (, &#x27;, ; ), also known as theMerve Oasis, was a major Iranian city in Central Asia, on the historical Silk Road, near today&#x27;s Mary, Turkmenistan. Human settlements on the site of Merv existed from the 3rd millennium BC until the 18th century AD. It changed hands repeatedly throughout history. Under the Achaemenid Empire, it was the center of the satrapy of Margiana. It was subsequently ruled by Hellenistic Kings, Parthians, Sasanians, Arabs, Ghaznavids, Seljuqs, Khwarazmians and Timurids, among others.

Merv was the capital city of several polities throughout its history. In the beginning of the 9th century, Merv was the seat of the caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun and the capital of the entire Islamic caliphate. It served later as the seat of the Tahirid governors of Khorasan. In the 11th–12th centuries, Merv was the capital of the Great Seljuk Empire and remained so until the latter&#x27;s ultimate fall. Around this time, Merv turned into a chief centre of Islamic science and culture, attracting as well as producing renowned poets, musicians, physicians, mathematicians and astronomers. The great Persian polymath Omar Khayyam, among others, spent a number of years working at the observatory in Merv. As Persian geographer and traveller al-Istakhri wrote of Merv: &quot;Of all the countries of Iran, these people were noted for their talents and education.&quot; Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi counted as many as 10 giant libraries in Merv, including one within a major mosque that contained 12,000 volumes.

Merv was also a popular place for pilgrimage, and several religions considered it holy. In Zoroastrianism, Merv (Mouru) was one of 16 perfect lands created by god Ahura Mazda. Between the 5th and 11th centuries, Merv served as the seat of an East Syrian metropolitan province. A descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, 8th Imam of Twelver Shia Islam, Ali ar-Ridha, moved to Merv from Baghdad and resided there for several years. Al-Muqanna, the &quot;Veiled Prophet&quot;, who gained many followers by claiming to be an incarnation of God, was born and started his movement in Merv.
During the 12th and 13th centuries, Merv may have been the world&#x27;s largest city, with a population of up to 500,000. During this period, Merv was known as &quot;Marw al-Shāhijān&quot; (Merv the Great), and frequently referred to as the &quot;capital of the eastern Islamic world&quot;. According to geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi, the city and its structures were visible from a day&#x27;s journey away. In 1221, the city opened its gates to an invading Mongol horde, resulting in massive devastation. Historical accounts contend that the entire population (including refugees) were killed; Tolui Khan is reputed to have slaughtered 700,000 people. Though partly rebuilt after the Mongol destruction, the city never regained its former prosperity. Between 1788 and 1789, the city was razed by Shah Murad of the Emirate of Bukhara for the last time, and its population deported. By the 1800s, under pressure from the Russians, the area surrounding Merv was completely deserted.

Today the site is preserved by the Government of Turkmenistan as the State Historical and Cultural Park &quot;Ancient Merv&quot;. It was established in 1987 and is regulated by Turkmenistan&#x27;s legislation. It is the oldest and most perfectly preserved of the oasis cities along the historical Silk Road in Central Asia. A few buildings and structures still stand today, especially those constructed in the last two millennia. UNESCO has listed the site of ancient Merv as a World Heritage Site.

== History ==

Merv has prehistoric roots: archaeological surveys have revealed many traces of village life as far back as the 3rd millennium BC and have associated the area culturally with the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex. The geography of the Zend-Avesta (commentaries on the Avesta) mentions Merv (under the name of &quot;Mouru&quot;) along with Balkh. In Zoroastrianism, the god Ahura Mazda created Mouru as one of sixteen perfect lands.

Under the Achaemenid Empire (c. 550–330 BC), the historical record mentions Merv as a place of some importance: under the name of &quot;Margu&quot;, it occurs as part of one satrapy in the Behistun inscriptions (c. 515 BC) of the Persian monarch Darius the Great. The first city of Merv was founded in the 6th century BC as part of the Achaemenid expansion into the region of Cyrus the Great (559–530 BC), but later strata deeply cover the Achaemenid levels at the site.

=== Hellenistic era ===

Alexander the Great&#x27;s visit to Merv is merely legendary, but the city was named Alexandria () after him for a time. After his death in 323 BC, it became the capital of the Province of Margiana of the Seleucid, Greco-Bactrian (256–125 BC), Parthian, and Sassanid states.

The Seleucid ruler Antiochus Soter (reigned 281–261 BC) renamed it to Antiochia Margiana. He rebuilt and expanded the city at the site presently known as Gyaur Gala fortress. Isidore of Charax wrote Antiochia was called the &quot;unwatered&quot; ().

=== Parthian era ===
After the fall of the Seleucid dynasty (63 BC), Bactria, Parthia, and the Kushans took control in succession. In 53 BC, some 10,000 Roman prisoners of war from the Battle of Carrhae appear to have been deported to Merv.

Merv was a major city of Buddhist learning, with Buddhist monastery temples for many centuries until its Islamisation. At the site of Gyaur Kala and , Buddhism was followed and practised often at the local Buddhist stupas.

=== Sasanian era ===

After the Sasanid Ardashir I (220–240 AD) took Merv, the study of numismatics picks up the thread: the unbroken series of coins originally minted at Merv document a long unbroken direct Sassanian rule of almost four centuries. During this period Merv was home to practitioners of various religions beside the official Sassanid Zoroastrianism, including Buddhists, Manichaeans, and Christians of the Church of the East. Between the 5th and 11th centuries, Merv served as the seat of an East Syrian metropolitan province. The first bishop was Barshabba (c.360/424). The Hephthalite occupation from the end of the 5th century to 565 AD briefly interrupted Sassanid rule.

===Arab conquest and influence===
Sassanian rule ended when the last Sassanian ruler, Yazdegerd III (632–651) was killed near the city and the Sassanian military governor surrendered to the approaching Arab army. Representatives of the caliph, Umar occupied the city, which became the capital of the Umayyad province of Khorasan. In 671, Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan sent 50,000 Arab troops to Merv as a colony. This colony retained its native Kufan sympathies and became the nucleus of Khurasan. Using the city as their base, the Arabs, led by Qutayba ibn Muslim from 705 to 715, brought large parts of Central Asia, including Balkh, Bukhara, and Fergana under subjection. Merv, and Khorasan, in general, became one of the first parts of the Persian-speaking world to become majority-Muslim. Arab immigration to the area was substantial. A Chinese man captured at Talas, Du Huan, was brought to Baghdad and toured the caliphate. He observed that in Merv, Khurasan, Arabs and Persians lived in mixed concentrations.

Merv gained renewed importance in February 748 when the Iranian general Abu Muslim (d. 755) declared a new Abbasid dynasty at Merv, expanding and re-founding the city, and, in the name of the Abbasid line, used the city as a base of rebellion against the Umayyad caliphate. After the Abbasids established themselves in Baghdad, Abu Muslim continued to rule Merv as a semi-independent prince until his eventual assassination. Indeed, Merv operated as the centre of Abbasid partisanship for the duration of the Abbasid Revolution of 746–750, and became a consistent source of political support for the Abbasid rulers in Baghdad later on; the governorship of Khurasan at Merv was one of the most important political figures of the Caliphate. The influential Barmakid family, based in Merv, played an important part in transferring Greek knowledge (established in Merv since the days of the Seleucids and Greco-Bactrians) into the Arab world.
Throughout the Abbasid era, Merv remained the capital and most important city of Khurasan. During this time, the Arab historian Al-Muqaddasi (c. 945/946–991) called Merv &quot;delightful, fine, elegant, brilliant, extensive, and pleasant&quot;. Merv&#x27;s architecture inspired the Abbasid re-planning of Baghdad. A 10th-century Arab historian, Ibn Hawqal, wrote of Merv: &quot;and in no other city are to be seen such palaces and groves, and gardens and streams&quot;.

Merv was also known for its high-quality textiles. A 12th-century Arab geographer al-Idrisi noted: &quot;From this country is derived much silk as well as cotton of a superior quality under the name of Merv cotton, which is extremely soft.&quot; The Islamic world admired the elegant robes and silk turbans produced in Merv. The city was notable as a home for immigrants from the Arab lands and those from Sogdia and elsewhere in Central Asia.

In the period from 813 to 818, the temporary residency of the caliph, al-Ma&#x27;mun effectively made Merv the capital of the Muslim world and highlighted Merv&#x27;s importance to the Abbasids. A descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, 8th Imam of Twelver Shia Islam, Ali ar-Ridha moved to Merv and lived there for several years. Merv also became the centre of a major 8th-century Neo-Mazdakite movement led by al-Muqanna, the &quot;Veiled Prophet&quot;, who gained many followers by claiming to be an incarnation of God and heir to Abu Muslim; the Khurramiyya inspired by him, persisted in Merv until the 12th century.

During this period Merv, like Samarqand and Bukhara, functioned as one of the great cities of Muslim scholarship; the celebrated historian Yaqut (1179–1229) studied in its libraries. Merv produced a number of scholars in various branches of knowledge, such as Islamic law, &quot;hadith&quot;, history, and literature. Several scholars have the name &quot;Marwazi&quot; (المروزي) designating them as hailing from Merv. The city continued to have a substantial Christian community. In 1009, the Archbishop of Merv sent a letter to the Patriarch at Baghdad asking that the Keraites be allowed to fast less than other Nestorian Christians. Great Persian polymath Omar Khayyam, among others, spent several years working at the observatory in Merv. As Persian geographer and traveller al-Istakhri wrote of Merv: &quot;Of all the countries of Iran, these people were noted for their talents and education.&quot; Yaqut al-Hamawi counted as many as 10 giant libraries in Merv, including one within a major mosque that contained 12,000 volumes.

As the caliphate weakened, Persian general Tahir b. al -Husayn and his Tahirid dynasty replaced Arab rule in Merv in 821. The Tahirids ruled Merv from 821 to 873, followed by the Saffarids, then the Samanids and later the Ghaznavids.

===Turkmens in Merv===

In 1037, the Seljuq Turkmens, a clan of Oghuz Turks moving from the steppes east of the Aral Sea, peacefully took over Merv under the leadership of Tughril—the Ghaznavid sultan Mas&#x27;ud I was extremely unpopular in the city. Tughril&#x27;s brother Chaghri stayed in Merv as the Seljuq domains grew to include the rest of Khurasan and Iran, and it subsequently became a favourite city of the Seljuq sultans. Chaghri, his son Alp Arslan (sultan from 1063 to 1072) and great-grandson Ahmad Sanjar (sultan from 1118 to 1157) were buried at Merv, the latter at the Tomb of Ahmad Sanjar.
Nearing the end of the 11th century, Merv became the eastern capital of the split Seljuq state. However, starting from 1118, it served as the capital of the whole empire. During this period, Merv expanded to its greatest size—Arab and Persian geographers termed it &quot;the mother of the world&quot;, the &quot;rendezvous of great and small&quot;, the &quot;chief city of Khurasan&quot; and the &quot;capital of the eastern Islamic world&quot;. Written sources also attest to a large library and madrasa founded by Nizam al-Mulk, vizier of the Seljuq empire, as well as many other major cultural institutions. Perhaps most importantly, Merv had a market described as &quot;the best of the major cities of Iran and Khurasan&quot;.

Sanjar&#x27;s rule, marked by conflict with the Kara-Khitai and Khwarazmians, ended in 1153 when Turkmen nomads from beyond the Amu Darya pillaged the city. Subsequently, Merv changed hands from the Turkmen nomads to the Ghurids in 1192, and to the Khwarizmians in 1204. According to Tertius Chandler, by 1150 Merv was the world&#x27;s largest city, with a population of 200,000. By 1210, it may have had as many as 500,000 residents, preceding such medieval metropolises as Constantinople and Baghdad.

===Mongols in Merv===
In 1221, Merv opened its gates to Tolui, son of Genghis Khan, chief of the Mongols. Most of the inhabitants are said to have been butchered. Arab historian Ibn al-Athir described the event basing his report on the narrative of Merv refugees:

A Persian historian, Juvayni, put the figure at more than 1,300,000. Each individual soldier of the conquering army &quot;was allotted the execution of three to four hundred persons&quot;, many of those soldiers being levies from Sarakhs who, because of their town&#x27;s enmity toward Merv, &quot;exceeded the ferocity of the heathen Mongols in the slaughter of their fellow-Muslims.&quot; Almost the entire population of Merv, and refugees arriving from the other parts of the Khwarazmian Empire, were slaughtered, making it one of the bloodiest captures of a city in world history.

Excavations revealed the drastic rebuilding of the city&#x27;s fortifications in the aftermath of their destruction, but the city&#x27;s prosperity had passed. The Mongol invasion spelled the eclipse of Merv and other major centres for more than a century. After the Mongol conquest, Merv became part of the Ilkhanate, and it was consistently looted by Chagatai Khanate. In the early part of the 14th century, the town became the seat of a Christian archbishopric of the Eastern Church under the rule of the Kartids, vassals of the Ilkhanids. By 1380, Merv belonged to the empire of Timur (Tamerlane).

===Uzbeks in Merv and its final destruction===
In 1505, the Uzbeks occupied Merv; five years later, Shah Ismail, the founder of the Safavid dynasty of Iran, expelled them. In this period, a Persian nobleman restored a large dam (the &quot;Soltanbent&quot;) on the river Murghab, and the settlement which grew up in the irrigated area became known as , as referenced in some 19th-century texts.

After Shah Ismail&#x27;s death, the region became a dependency of Khiva, but in 1593 Merv was conquered by Abdullah Khan II of Bukhara. The city was soon captured by Shah Abbas, and a Safavid governor (Biktash Khan Ustajlu) was appointed to the governorship in 1600. In 1608, Mihrab Khan Qajar became governor, beginning two centuries of Qajar governorship over Merv. From 1715, the Qajar elite began to assert Merv&#x27;s independence from the Safavid government, but within a decade the oasis became insecure due to raids by Tatars and Turkmens. Nader Shah launched military campaigns that cowed the Turkmens and Tatars and restored Merv&#x27;s irrigation system. After Nader Shah&#x27;s death, the local Qajars in the region declared independence and formed the Qajar Principality of Merv. In 1785, the Manghit amir of Bukhara, Shah Murad, attacked the city and killed the ruler, Bayram &#x27;Ali Khan Qajar. A few years later, in 1788 and 1789, Shah Murad razed the city to the ground, and broke down the dams, leaving the area a waste land.

The entire population of the city and the surrounding oasis of about 100,000 were then deported in several stages to the Bukharan oasis and the Samarkand region in the Zarafshan Valley. Being the last remaining Persian-speaking Shias, the deportees resisted assimilation into the Sunni population of Bukhara and Samarkand, despite the common Persian language they spoke with most natives. These Marvis survive —Soviet censuses listed them as &quot;Iranis/Iranians&quot; through the 1980s. They live in Samarkand and Bukhara and the area in between on the Zarafshan river. They are listed as Persian speaking but counted separately from the local Tajiks because of their Shia religion and their maintaining of their ancient Mervi identity.

===Nineteenth century===

Merv passed to the Khanate of Khiva in 1823. Sir Alexander Burnes traversed the country in 1832. About this time, the Persians forced the Tekke Turkmens, then living on the Tejen River, to migrate northward. Khiva contested the Tekkes&#x27; advance, but in about 1856, the latter became the sovereign power in the country, and remained so until the Russians occupied the oasis in 1884. By 1868, the Russians had taken most of what would become Russian Central Asia except Turkmenistan. The Russians approached this area from the Caspian, and in 1881, they captured Geok Tepe in one of the bloodiest battles in the region. Much of the civilian population that was unable to flee was later massacred by the Russian troops. The Russians further occupied the oasis of Tejen, eighty miles to the west. The next Russian move was south toward Herat. By 1888, the city was entirely abandoned.

A future viceroy of British India, George Curzon visited the remains of Merv in 1888. He later wrote: &quot;In the midst of an absolute wilderness of crumbling brick and clay, the spectacle of walls, towers, ramparts and domes, stretching in bewildering confusion to the horizon, reminds us that we are in the centre of bygone greatness.&quot;

== Remains ==
Some exploratory excavations at Merv were conducted in 1885 by the Russian general A. V. Komarov, the governor of the Transcaspian oblast, 1883–1889; Komarov employed his troops as excavators and published his collection of trophy artifacts and coins from the area in 1900. Valentin Alekseevich Zhukovsky of the Imperial Archaeological Commission directed the first fully professional dig in 1890 and published in 1894. Geologist Raphael Pumpelly and a German archaeologist, Hubert Schmidt, directed the American Carnegie Institute&#x27;s excavations.

Merv is the focus of the Ancient Merv Project (initially called the International Merv Project). From 1992 to 2000, a joint team of archaeologists from Turkmenistan and the UK have made remarkable discoveries. In 2001, the Institute of Archaeology, University College London and the Turkmen authorities started a new collaboration. This Ancient Merv Project is concerned with the complex conservation and management issues posed by this site, furthering understanding of the site through archaeological research, and disseminating the results of the work to the widest possible audience.

===Organization of remains===
Merv consists of a few discrete walled cities very near to each other constructed on uninhabited land by builders of different eras, used, and then abandoned and never rebuilt. Four walled cities correspond to the chief periods of Merv&#x27;s importance: the oldest, Erkgala, corresponds to Achaemenid Merv, the smallest of the three. (also known as Gyaur Gala), which surrounds Erkgala, comprises the Hellenistic and Sassanian metropolis and also served as an industrial suburb to the Abbasid/Seljuk city, Soltangala—by far the largest of the three. The smaller Timurid city was founded a short distance to the south and is now called Abdyllahangala. Other ancient buildings are scattered between and around these four cities; all the sites are preserved in the &quot;Ancient Merv Archaeological Park&quot; just north of the modern village of and east of the large Soviet-built city of Mary.

====Erk Gala====
 Erk Gala (from Persian, &quot;the citadel fort&quot;) is the oldest part of the city of Merv complex. Built in the 7th century BC, Erk Gala was built as a Persian Style fortress controlling the oasis on the Murghab River. The Erk Gala fortress later served as the acropolis for the Hellenistic city and later the Arc of the Islamic city.

====Gäwürgala====
The foundation of (Turkmen from the Persian &quot;Gabr Qala&quot;, &quot;Fortress of the Zoroastrians&quot;) occurred in the early Hellenistic era under the rule of the Seleucid king Antiochus I. The city was continuously inhabited under a series of Hellenistic rulers, by the Parthians, and then under the Sassanids, who made it the capital of a satrapy. was the capital of the Umayyad province of Khurasan and grew in importance as Khurasan became the most loyally Muslim part of the Iranian world during Islam&#x27;s first two centuries.

&#x27;s most visible remaining structures are its defensive installations. Three walls, one built atop the next, are in evidence. A Seleucid wall, graduated in the interior and straight on the exterior, forms a platform for the second, larger wall, built of mudbricks and stepped on the interior. The form of this wall is like other Hellenistic fortresses found in Anatolia, though this is unique for being made of mudbrick instead of stone. The third wall is possibly Sassanian and is built of larger bricks. Surrounding the wall were a variety of pottery sherds, particularly Parthian ones. The size of these fortifications is evidence of Merv&#x27;s importance during the pre-Islamic era; no pre-Islamic fortifications of comparable size have been found anywhere in the Garagum. is also important for the vast amount of numismatic evidence it has revealed; an unbroken series of Sassanian coins has been found there, hinting the extraordinary political stability of this period. Even after the foundation of Soltangala by Abu Muslim at the start of the Abbasid dynasty, persisted as a suburb of the larger Soltangala. In are concentrated many Abbasid-era &quot;industrial&quot; buildings: pottery kilns, steel, iron and copper-working workshops and so on. A well-preserved pottery kiln has an intact vaulted arch support and a square firepit. seems to have been the craftsmen&#x27;s quarters throughout the Abbasid and pre-Seljuk periods.

====Soltangala====

Soltangala (from &quot;Sultan Qala&quot;, the sultan&#x27;s fortress) is by far the largest of Merv&#x27;s cities. Textual sources establish it was Abu Muslim, the leader of the Abbasid rebellion, who symbolised the beginning of the new Caliphate by commissioning monumental structures to the west of the walls, in what then became Soltangala. The area was quickly walled and became the core of medieval Merv; the many Abbasid-era &quot;köshks&quot; (fortified building) discovered in and outside Soltangala attest to the centuries of prosperity which followed. &quot;Kushks&quot; (Persian, &quot;Kushk&quot;, &quot;pavilion&quot;, &quot;kiosk&quot;), which comprise the chief remains of Abbasid Merv, are a building type unique to Central Asia during this period. A kind of semi-fortified two-story palace, whose corrugated walls give it a unique and striking appearance, &quot;köshks&quot; were the residences of Merv&#x27;s elite. The second storey of these structures comprised living quarters; the first storey may have been used for storage. Parapets lined the roof, which was often used for living quarters as well. Merv&#x27;s largest and best-preserved Abbasid &quot;köşk&quot; is the Greater Gyzgala (Turkmen, &quot;maiden&#x27;s fortress&quot;), located just outside Soltangala&#x27;s western wall; this structure consisted of 17 rooms surrounding a central courtyard. The nearby Lesser Gyzgala had extraordinarily thick walls with deep corrugations, as well as multiple interior stairways leading to second storey living quarters. All of Merv&#x27;s &quot;kushks&quot; are in precarious states of preservation.

However, the most important of Soltangala&#x27;s surviving buildings are Seljuq constructions. Seljuq leader Toghrul&#x27;s conquest of Merv in 1037 revitalised the city; under his descendants, especially Sanjar, who made it his residence, Merv found itself at the centre of a large multicultural empire.
Evidence of this prosperity is found throughout the Soltangala. Many of these buildings are concentrated in Soltangala&#x27;s citadel, the Shahryar Ark (Persian, &quot;the Sovereign&#x27;s citadel&quot;), is on its east side. In the centre of the Sharhryar Ark is the Seljuk palace, probably built by Sanjar. The surviving mud brick walls lead to the conclusion that this palace, though relatively small, was composed of tall, single-storey rooms surrounding a central court along with four axial iwans at the entrance to each side. Low areas nearby seem to indicate a large garden, which included an artificial lake; similar gardens were found in other Central Asian palaces. Any remnants of interior or exterior decoration have been lost because of erosion or theft.

Another notable Seljuk structure within the Shahryar Ark is the &quot;kepderihana&quot; (from the Persian, &quot;Kaftar Khaneh&quot;, or &quot;pigeon house&quot;, i.e., the columbarium). This mysterious building, among the best-preserved in the whole Merv oasis, comprises one long and narrow windowless room with many tiers of niches across the walls. Some sources Believe the &quot;kepter khana&quot; (there are more elsewhere in Merv and Central Asia) was a pigeon roost used to raise pigeons, to collect their dung, which was used in growing the melons for which Merv was famous. Others see the &quot;kepderihanas&quot; as libraries or treasuries, because of their location in high status areas next to important structures.
The best-preserved of all the structures in Merv is the 12th-century mausoleum of Sultan Sanjar, also in Sultan Gala. It is the largest of Seljuk mausoleums and is also the first dated mosque-mausoleum complex, a form which was later to become common. It is square, per side, with two entrances on opposite sides; a large central dome supported by an octagonal system of ribs and arches covers the interior (Ettinghausen, 270). The dome&#x27;s exterior was turquoise, and its height made it imposing; it was said that approaching caravans could see the mausoleum while still a day&#x27;s march from the city. The mausoleum&#x27;s decoration, in typical early Seljuk style, was conservative, with interior stucco work and geometric brick decoration, now mainly lost, on the outside. Except for the recently &quot;reconstructed&quot; exterior decoration, the largely intact mausoleum remains just as it was in the 12th century.

A final set of Seljuq remains are the walls of the Soltangala. These fortifications, which largely remain, began as mud brick structures, inside of which were chambers for defenders to shoot arrows from. There were horseshoe-shaped towers every . These walls, however, did not prove to be effective because they were not of adequate thickness to withstand catapults and other artillery. By the mid-12th century, the galleries were filled in, and the wall was greatly strengthened. A secondary, smaller wall was built in front of the Soltangala&#x27;s main wall, and finally the medieval city&#x27;s suburbs—known today as Isgendergala—were enclosed by a wall. The three walls held off the Mongol army for at least one of its offensives, before ultimately succumbing in 1221.
Many ceramics have been recovered from the Abbasid and Seljuk eras, primarily from , the city walls of Soltangala, and the Shahryar Ark. The ware was primarily late Abbasid and consisted primarily of red slip-painted bowls with geometric designs. The pottery recovered from the Sultan Gala walls is dominated by 11th to 12th-century colour-splashed yellow and green pottery, similar to contemporary styles common in Nishapur. Turquoise and black bowls were discovered in the Shahryar Ark palace, as well as a deposit of Mongol-style pottery, perhaps related to the city&#x27;s unsuccessful re-foundation under the Il-khans. Also from this era, is a ceramic mask used for decorating walls found among the ruins of what is believed—not without controversy—to be a Mongol-built Buddhist temple in the southern suburbs of Sultan Gala.

====Shaim Kala====
Shaim Kala was built in the 7th AD. Shaim Kala was a self-contained walled city intended to relieve over-crowding, and to deal with the religious and political discontent of the newly arrived peoples.

====Abdyllahangala====
Abdyllahangala is the post medieval Timurid era city to the south of the main complex.

== Demographics ==
Today, the site of the ancient Merv is located near city of Mary velayat, Turkmenistan. It is a city in and the seat of Baýramaly District, Mary Province, Turkmenistan. It lies about 27 km east of the provincial capital Mary. In 2009, its population was estimated at 88,486 (up from 43,824 in the 1989 census).

The present inhabitants of the oasis are primarily Turkmens of the Teke tribe and some Persians or Tajiks. There are relatively large minorities of the Beluch and the Brahui in the Merv Oasis as well.

== Economy ==

An elaborate system of canals cut from the Murghab irrigates the oasis. The country is renowned throughout the East for its fertility. Every kind of cereal and many fruits grow in great abundance, e.g. wheat, millet, barley and melons, also rice and cotton. Cotton seeds from archaeological levels as far back as the 5th century are the first indication that cotton textiles were already an important economic component of the Sassanian city. Silkworms have been bred. Turkmens possess a famous breed of horses (Turkoman horse) and keep camels, sheep, cattle, asses and mules. Turkmens work in silver and armour. One discovery of the 1990s excavations was a 9th- to 10th-century workshop where crucible steel was being produced, confirming contemporary Islamic reports by Islamic scholar al-Kindi (AD 801–866). He referred to the region of Khorasan as producing steel. This was made by a co-fusion process where cast iron and wrought iron are melted together.

== Geography ==

The oasis of Merv is situated on the Murghab River that flows down from Afghanistan, on the southern edge of the Karakum Desert, at 37°30’N and 62°E, about north of Herat, and south of Khiva. Its area is about . The great chain of mountains which, under the names of Paropamisade and Hindu Kush, extends from the Caspian Sea to the Pamir Mountains is interrupted some south of Merv. Through or near this gap flow northwards in parallel courses the Tejen and Murgab rivers, until they lose themselves in the Karakum Desert. Thus, they make Merv a sort of watch tower over the entrance into Afghanistan on the north-west and at the same time create a stepping-stone or &quot;étape&quot; between north-east Persia and the states of Bukhara and Samarqand.

Merv is advantageously situated in the inland delta of the Murghab River, which flows from its source in the Hindu Kush northwards through the Garagum desert. The Murghab delta region, known to the Greeks as Margiana, gives Merv two distinct advantages: first, it provides an easy southeast–northwest route from the Afghan highlands towards the lowlands of Karakum, the Amu Darya valley and Khwarezm. Second, the Murgab delta, being a large well-watered zone in the midst of the dry Karakum, serves as a natural stopping-point for the routes from northwest Iran towards Transoxiana—the Silk Roads. The delta, and thus Merv, lies at the junction of these two routes: the northwest–southeast route to Herat and Balkh (to the Indus and beyond) and the southwest–northeast route from Tus and Nishapur to Bukhara and Samarkand.

This place was a stop on the Silk Road during the time of the Han dynasty. Here merchants could trade for fresh horses or camels at this oasis city.

== International relations ==
UNESCO has listed the site of ancient Merv as a World Heritage Site.

<text>The Summer Palace () is a vast ensemble of lakes, gardens and palaces in Beijing. It was an imperial garden during the Qing dynasty. Inside includes Longevity Hill () Kunming Lake and Seventeen Hole Bridge. It covers an expanse of , three-quarters of which is water.

Longevity Hill is about high and has many buildings positioned in sequence. The front hill is the site of splendid halls and pavilions, while the back hill, in sharp contrast, is quiet with natural beauty. The central Kunming Lake, covering , was entirely man-made and the excavated soil was used to build Longevity Hill.

The Summer Palace, which is inspired by the gardens of South China, contains over 3,000 Chinese ancient buildings that house a collection of over 40,000 valuable historical relics from various dynasties.

In December 1998, UNESCO included the Summer Palace on its World Heritage List. It declared the Summer Palace &quot;a masterpiece of Chinese landscape garden design. The natural landscape of hills and open water is combined with artificial features such as pavilions, halls, palaces, temples and bridges to form a harmonious ensemble of outstanding aesthetic value&quot;.

Notably in Chinese history, it is also the Central Route terminus of the South-North Water Transfer Project having traversed from Danjiangkou Reservoir, Hubei, making it Beijing&#x27;s main water supply.

==History==

===Pre-Qing dynasty===

The origins of the Summer Palace date back to the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty. In 1153, when the fourth ruler, Wanyan Liang (r. 1150–1161), moved the Jin capital from Huining Prefecture (in present-day Acheng District, Harbin, Heilongjiang) to Yanjing (present-day Beijing), he ordered the construction of a palace in the Fragrant Hills and Jade Spring Hill in what is now the northwest of Beijing.

Around 1271, after the Yuan dynasty established its capital in Khanbaliq (present-day Beijing), the engineer Guo Shoujing initiated a waterworks project to direct the water from Shenshan Spring (神山泉) in Baifu Village (白浮村), Changping into the Western Lake (西湖), which would later become Kunming Lake. Guo aimed to create a water reservoir that would ensure a stable water supply for the palace.

In 1494, the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–1505) of the Ming dynasty had a Yuanjing Temple (圓靜寺) built for his wet nurse, Lady Luo, in front of Jar Hill (瓮山), which was later renamed Longevity Hill. The temple fell into disrepair over the years and was abandoned, and the area around the hill became lush with vegetation. The Zhengde Emperor (r. 1505–21), who succeeded the Hongzhi Emperor, built a palace on the banks of the Western Lake and turned the area into an imperial garden. He renamed Jar Hill &quot;Golden Hill&quot; (金山) and named the lake &quot;Golden Sea&quot; (金海). Both the Zhengde Emperor and the Wanli Emperor (r. 1572–1620) enjoyed taking boat rides on the lake. During the reign of the Tianqi Emperor (r. 1620–27), the court eunuch Wei Zhongxian took the imperial garden as his personal property.

===Qing dynasty===

In the early Qing dynasty, Jar Hill served as the site for horse stables in the imperial palace. Eunuchs who committed offences were sent there to weed and cut grass. At the beginning of the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735-1796), many imperial gardens were built in the area around present-day Beijing&#x27;s Haidian District and accordingly, water consumption increased tremendously. At the time, much of the water stored in the Western Lake came from the freshwater spring on Jade Spring Hill, while a fraction came from the Wanquan River (萬泉河). Any disruption of the water flow from Jade Spring Hill would have affected the capital&#x27;s water transport and water supply systems.

Around 1749, the Qianlong Emperor decided to build a palace in the vicinity of Jar Hill and the Western Lake to celebrate the 60th birthday of his mother, Empress Dowager Chongqing. He ordered the Western Lake to be expanded further west to create two more lakes, Gaoshui Lake (高水湖) and Yangshui Lake (養水湖), with the aim of improving the capital&#x27;s waterworks system. The three lakes served not only as a reservoir for the imperial gardens but also as a source of water for the surrounding agricultural areas. The Qianlong Emperor collectively named the three lakes &quot;Kunming Lake&quot; after the Kunming Pool (昆明池) constructed by Emperor Wu (2nd century BC) in the Han dynasty for the training of his navy. The earth excavated from the expansion of Kunming Lake was used to enlarge Jar Hill, which was renamed &quot;Longevity Hill&quot;. The Summer Palace, whose construction was completed in 1764 at a cost of over 4.8 million silver taels, was initially named &quot;Qingyiyuan&quot; (清漪園; &#x27;Gardens of Clear Ripples&quot;&#x27;).

The design of the Summer Palace was based on a legend in Chinese mythology about three divine mountains in the East Sea, namely Penglai, Fangzhang (方丈) and Yingzhou (瀛洲). The three islands in Kunming Lake – Nanhu Island (南湖島), Tuancheng Island (團城島) and Zaojiantang Island (藻鑒堂島) – were made to represent the three mountains, while the lake itself was based on a blueprint of the West Lake in Hangzhou. Moreover, many architectural features in the palace were also built to resemble or imitate various attractions around China. For example, the Phoenix Pier (鳳凰墩) represented Lake Tai; the Jingming Tower (景明樓) resembled Yueyang Tower, Hunan; the Wangchan Pavilion (望蟾閣) resembled Yellow Crane Tower; the shopping streets were designed to imitate those in Suzhou and Yangzhou. The centrepiece of the Summer Palace was the &quot;Great Temple of Gratitude and Longevity&quot; (大報恩延壽寺). There was also a Long Corridor more than 700 metres (2,300 ft) long which was furnished with artistic decorations. As the palace was not equipped with facilities for long-term residence and the daily administration of state affairs, the Qianlong Emperor never dwelt there and only remained for the day whenever he visited it.

As the Qing Empire started declining after the reign of the Daoguang Emperor (r. 1820–1850), the Summer Palace gradually became more neglected and the architectural features on the three islands were ordered to be dismantled because the costs of maintenance were too high. During the Second Opium War, British and French forces occupied the Summer Palace and the nearby Old Summer Palace in December 1860, sacking both and burning the latter. The occupations came as part of an invasion of Northern China by Britain and France to force the government of the Qing dynasty to come to the negotiating table. Despite being looted, the Summer Palace was not burned, however, as the British High Commissioner to China, Lord Elgin, had not issued orders to do so.

Between 1884–95, during the reign of the Guangxu Emperor (r. 1875–1908), Empress Dowager Cixi reportedly ordered up to 22 million silver taels,[4] originally designated for upgrading the Qing navy (the Beiyang Fleet), to be used for reconstructing and enlarging the Summer Palace to celebrate her 60th birthday; however, some other sources state that a maximum of six million taels were allotted, of which none came from the Navy&#x27;s capital budget, but only the accrued bank interest paid.[5] As the funds were limited, the construction works were concentrated on the buildings at the front of Longevity Hill and the dams around Kunming Lake. The Summer Palace was also given its present-day Chinese name, &quot;Yiheyuan&quot; (頤和園), in 1888. In 1900, towards the end of the Boxer Rebellion, the Summer Palace suffered damage again when the forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance destroyed the imperial gardens and seized many artifacts stored in the palace. The palace was restored two years later.

===Post-Qing dynasty===

In 1912, following the abdication of the Puyi, the Last Emperor, the Summer Palace became the private property of the former imperial family of the Qing Empire. Two years later, the Summer Palace was opened to the public and entry tickets were sold. In 1924, after Puyi was expelled from the Forbidden City by the warlord Feng Yuxiang, the Beijing municipal government took charge of administering the Summer Palace and turned it into a public park.

After 1949, the Summer Palace briefly housed the Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party. Many of Mao Zedong&#x27;s friends and key figures in the Communist Party, such as Liu Yazi and Jiang Qing, also lived there. Since 1953, many major restoration and renovation works have been done on the Summer Palace, which is now open to the public as a tourist attraction and park.

In November 1998, the Summer Palace was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Towards the end of 2006, the Chinese government also started distributing commemorative coins to celebrate the Summer Palace as a cultural relic of the world.

==Attractions==


The entire Summer Palace is centered around Longevity Hill and Kunming Lake, with the latter covering about three-quarters of the area. Most of the important buildings were built along the north–south axis of Longevity Hill, which is divided into the front hill and the back hill. There are three small islands within Kunming Lake: Nanhu Island, Zaojiantang Island and Zhijingge Island. The West Dam of Kunming Lake divides the lake into two. The East Dam was constructed during the reign of the Guangxu Emperor. The attractions in the Summer Palace may be divided into six different sections or scenic areas: the Halls, Longevity Hill, Kunming Lake, the Farming and Weaving Picture Scenic Area, the Long Corridor, and the Central Axis area. Summer Palace is among the most-visited destinations in China, ranking in the top five, and attracts about 10 million tourists annually.

===Front Hill===

* Eastern Palace Gate (simplified Chinese: 东宫门; traditional Chinese: 東宮門; pinyin: &quot;Dōnggōngmén&quot;): The main entrance to the Summer Palace. The two bronze lions on either side of the gate are preserved from the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s time while the Cloud Dragon Steps in front of the gate are relics from the Old Summer Palace. The three Chinese characters &quot;Yiheyuan&quot; on the sign above the gate were written by the Guangxu Emperor.
* Hall of Benevolence and Longevity (仁寿殿; 仁壽殿; &quot;Rénshòudiàn&quot;): The hall where court sessions were held. It was called the &quot;Hall of Good Governance&quot; (勤政殿) in the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s time but was given its present-day name by the Guangxu Emperor. The well north of the hall is called the &quot;Year-Prolonging Well&quot; (延年井) while the rockery behind the hall was designed to imitate the Lion Grove Garden in Suzhou. The stalactites are relics from the Old Summer Palace.
* Hall of Jade Billows (玉澜堂; 玉瀾堂; &quot;Yùlántáng&quot;): Located west of the Hall of Benevolence and Longevity. It was the living quarters of the Qing emperors. The Guangxu Emperor was once confined here by Empress Dowager Cixi.
* Yiyun Hall (宜芸馆; 宜芸館; &quot;Yíyúnguǎn&quot;): Located north of the Hall of Jade Billows. It was originally a library in the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s time but became the living quarters of Empress Longyu in the Guangxu Emperor&#x27;s time. It housed a collection of stone carvings of calligraphy written by the Qianlong Emperor.
* Dehe Garden [ru] (德和园; 德和園; &quot;Déhéyuán&quot;): Houses the three-storey Great Opera Hall (大戏楼; 大戲樓), where opera performances were staged.
* Hall of Joy and Longevity (乐寿堂; 樂壽堂; &quot;Lèshòutáng&quot;): The living quarters of Empress Dowager Cixi.
* Long Corridor (长廊; 長廊; &quot;Chángláng&quot;): Stretches from the Hall of Joy and Longevity in the east to Shizhang Pavilion in the west. The entire corridor is 728 metres (2,388 ft) long and contains artistic decorations, including paintings of famous places in China, and scenes from Chinese mythology and folktales, &quot;The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars&quot; and the Four Great Classical Novels.
* Hall of Dispelling Clouds (排云殿; 排雲殿; &quot;Páiyúndiàn&quot;): Situated on the centre of the central axis of Longevity Hill. Originally the Great Temple of Gratitude and Longevity (大報恩延壽寺), it was renovated in 1892 and became a place for Empress Dowager Cixi to receive guests, host grand ceremonies, and celebrate her birthday.
* Tower of Buddhist Incense (佛香阁; 佛香閣; &quot;Fóxiānggé&quot;): Located right in the centre of the front hill of Longevity Mountain. The tower was originally meant to be a nine-storey Buddhist pagoda built to resemble the Yellow Crane Tower. The Qianlong Emperor ordered the construction to be stopped just after the eighth storey was built. The tower was built on a 20 m (66 ft) tall stone base, measures three stories and 41 metres (135 ft) in height, and is supported by eight ironwood pillars. Empress Dowager Cixi visited the tower to offer incense and pray.
* Sea of Wisdom (智慧海; &quot;Zhìhuìhǎi&quot;): Located on the peak of Longevity Hill. It was built from coloured glass and houses over 1,000 statues of Buddhist figures. It was partially damaged during the Cultural Revolution.
