<doc id="250548" wikidata="Q867081" url="?curid=250548" title="Free love">
<text>Free love is a social movement that accepts all forms of love. The movement&#x27;s initial goal was to separate the state from sexual and romantic matters such as marriage, birth control, and adultery. It stated that such issues were the concern of the people involved and no one else. The movement began during the 19th century and was advanced by hippies during the 1960s and early 70s.
== Principles ==
Much of the free love tradition reflects a liberal philosophy that seeks freedom from state regulation and church interference in personal relationships. According to this concept, the free unions of adults (or persons at or above the age of consent) are legitimate relations which should be respected by all third parties whether they are emotional or sexual relations. In addition, some free love writing has argued that both men and women have the right to sexual pleasure without social or legal restraints. In the Victorian era, this was a radical notion. Later, a new theme developed, linking free love with radical social change and depicting it as a of a new anti-authoritarian, anti-repressive sensibility.

According to the modern stereotype, earlier middle-class Americans wanted the home to be a place of stability in an uncertain world. To this mentality are attributed strongly defined gender roles, which led to a minority reaction in the form of the free-love movement.

While the phrase &quot;free love&quot; is often associated with promiscuity in the popular imagination, especially in reference to the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s, historically, the free-love movement has not advocated multiple sexual partners or short-term sexual relationships. Rather, it has argued that sexual relations that are freely entered into should not be regulated by law, and may be initiated or terminated by the parties involved at will. Nevertheless, it has been acknowledged that many men who participated in the free love movement also saw free love as a way to get free sex.

The term &quot;sex radical&quot; is often used interchangeably with the term &quot;free lover&quot;. By whatever name, advocates had two strong beliefs: opposition to the idea of forced sexual activity in a relationship and advocacy for a woman to use her body in any way that she pleases.

Laws of particular concern to free love movements have included those that prevent an unmarried couple from living together, and those that regulate :adultery and :divorce, as well as :age of consent, :birth control, :homosexuality, :abortion, and sometimes :prostitution; although not all free-love advocates agree on these issues. The abrogation of individual rights in marriage is also a concern—for example, some jurisdictions do not recognize spousal rape, or they treat it less seriously than non-spousal rape. Free-love movements since the 19th century have also defended the right to publicly discuss sexuality and have battled obscenity laws.

===Relationship to feminism===

The history of free love is entwined with the history of feminism. From the late 18th century, leading feminists, such as Mary Wollstonecraft, have challenged the institution of marriage, and many have advocated its abolition.

According to feminist critique, a married woman was solely a wife and mother, denying her the opportunity to pursue other occupations; sometimes this was legislated, as with bans on married women and mothers being employed as teachers. In 1855, free love advocate Mary Gove Nichols (1810–1884) described marriage as the &quot;annihilation of woman&quot;, explaining that women were considered to be men&#x27;s property in law and public sentiment, making it possible for tyrannical men to deprive their wives of all freedom. For example, the law often allowed a husband to beat his wife. Free-love advocates argued that many children were born into unloving marriages out of compulsion, but should instead be the result of choice and affection—yet children born out of wedlock did not have the same rights as children with married parents.

In 1857, in the &quot;Social Revolutionist&quot;, Minerva Putnam complained that &quot;in the discussion of free love, no woman has attempted to give her views on the subject&quot; and challenged every woman reader to &quot;rise in the dignity of her nature and declare herself free.&quot;

The figureheads of the free love movement were often men, both in leading organizations and contributing to its ideology. Almost all books endorsing free love in the 1850s were by men, except for Mary Gove Nichols&#x27;s 1855 autobiography. This was the first full-length case against marriage written by a woman. Of the four major free-love periodicals in the Reconstruction era, half had woman editors.

To proponents of free love, the act of sex was not just about reproduction. Access to birth control was considered a means to women&#x27;s independence, and leading birth-control activists also embraced free love. Sexual radicals remained focused on their attempts to uphold a woman&#x27;s right to control her body and to freely discuss issues such as contraception, marital-sex abuse (emotional and physical), and sexual education. These people believed that by talking about female sexuality, they would help empower women. To help achieve this goal, such radical thinkers relied on the written word, books, pamphlets, and periodicals, and by these means the movement was sustained for over fifty years, spreading the message of free love all over the United States. However, many feminists would point out that the 1960s free love movement did not significantly change views about women&#x27;s role in mainstream America. Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic founder Dr. David Smith, who was a prominent participant in the 1967 Summer of Love, acknowledged in 2007 how many of the men who participated in the event viewed women as prone.

==History==

===Early precedents===

A number of utopian social movements throughout history have shared a vision of free love. An early Christian sect known as the Adamites existed in North Africa in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th centuries and rejected marriage. They practiced nudism and believed themselves to be without original sin.

In the 6th century, adherents of Mazdakism in pre-Muslim Persia apparently supported a kind of free love in the place of marriage. One folk story from the period that contains a mention of a free-love (and nudist) community under the sea is &quot;The Tale of Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman&quot; from &quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights&quot; ().

Karl Kautsky, writing in 1895, noted that a number of &quot;communistic&quot; movements throughout the Middle Ages also rejected marriage. Typical of such movements, the Cathars of 10th to 14th century Western Europe freed followers from all moral prohibition and religious obligation, but respected those who lived simply, avoided the taking of human or animal life, and were celibate. Women had an uncommon equality and autonomy, even as religious leaders. The Cathars and similar groups (the Waldenses, Apostle brothers, Beghards and Beguines, Lollards, and Hussites) were branded as heretics by the Roman Catholic Church and suppressed. Other movements shared their critique of marriage but advocated free sexual relations rather than celibacy, such as the Brethren of the Free Spirit, Taborites, and Picards.

Free love was an element in radical thinking during the &quot;English Revolution&quot; of 1640–1660, most strongly associated with the &quot;Ranters&quot;. There were also perceptive critiques, within these radical movements, such as by Gerrard Winstanley: The mother and child begotten in this manner is like to have the worst of it, for the man will be gone and leave them ... after he hath had his pleasure. ... By seeking their own freedom they embondage others. 

===Enlightenment thought===
The ideals of free love found their champion in one of the earliest English feminists, Mary Wollstonecraft. In her writings, Wollstonecraft challenged the institution of marriage, and advocated its abolition. Her novels criticized the social construction of marriage and its effects on women. In her first novel, &quot;Mary: A Fiction&quot; written in 1788, the heroine is forced into a loveless marriage for economic reasons. She finds love in relationships with another man and a woman. The novel, &quot;Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman&quot;, never finished but published in 1798, revolves around the story of a woman imprisoned in an asylum by her husband. Maria finds fulfilment outside of marriage, in an affair with a fellow inmate. Wollstonecraft makes it clear that &quot;women had strong sexual desires and that it was degrading and immoral to pretend otherwise.&quot;

Wollstonecraft felt that women should not give up freedom and control of their sexuality, and thus did not marry her partner, Gilbert Imlay, despite the two conceiving and having a child together in the midst of the Terror of the French Revolution. Though the relationship ended badly, due in part to the discovery of Imlay&#x27;s infidelity, and not least because Imlay abandoned her for good, Wollstonecraft&#x27;s belief in free love survived. She later developed a relationship with the anarchist William Godwin, who shared her free love ideals, and published on the subject throughout his life. However, the two did decide to marry, just months before her death from complications in parturition.

A member of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s circle of notable radical intellectuals in England was the Romantic poet William Blake, who explicitly compared the sexual oppression of marriage to slavery in works such as &quot;Visions of the Daughters of Albion&quot; (1793), published five years after Wollstonecraft&#x27;s &quot;Mary&quot;. Blake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue. At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine&#x27;s apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house. His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection, and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws. Poems such as &quot;Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?&quot; and &quot;Earth&#x27;s Answer&quot; seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem &quot;London&quot; he speaks of &quot;the Marriage-Hearse&quot; plagued by &quot;the youthful Harlot&#x27;s curse&quot;, the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry. &quot;Visions of the Daughters of Albion&quot; is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the &quot;frozen marriage-bed&quot;. In &quot;Visions&quot;, Blake writes:

Blake believed that humans were &quot;fallen&quot;, and that a major impediment to a free love society was corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication. He also seems to have thought that marriage should afford the joy of love, but that in reality it often does not, as a couple&#x27;s knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy:

In an act understood to support free love, the child of Wollstonecraft and Godwin, Mary, took up with the then still-married English romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1814 at the young age of sixteen. Shelley wrote in defence of free love in the prose notes of &quot;Queen Mab&quot; (1813), in his essay &quot;On Love&quot; (), and in the poem &quot;Epipsychidion&quot; (1821).

===Utopian socialism===

Sharing the free-love ideals of the earlier social movements—as well as their feminism, pacifism, and simple communal life—were the utopian socialist communities of early-nineteenth-century France and Britain, associated with writers and thinkers such as Henri de Saint-Simon and Charles Fourier in France, and Robert Owen in England. Fourier, who coined the term &quot;feminism,&quot; argued for true freedom, without suppressing passions: the suppression of passions is not only destructive to the individual, but to society as a whole. He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused, and that &quot;affirming one&#x27;s difference&quot; can actually enhance social integration.

===Origins of the movement===
The eminent sociologist Herbert Spencer argued in his &quot;Principles of Sociology&quot; for the implementation of free divorce. Claiming that marriage consists of two components, &quot;union by law&quot; and &quot;union by affection&quot;, he argued that with the loss of the latter union, legal union should lose all meaning and dissolve automatically, without the legal requirement for a divorce. Free love particularly stressed women&#x27;s rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.

====United States====
&quot;Free love&quot; began to coalesce into a movement in the mid- to late 19th century. The term was coined by the Christian socialist writer John Humphrey Noyes, although he preferred to use the term &#x27;complex marriage&#x27;. Noyes founded the Oneida Community in 1848, a utopian community that &quot;[rejected] conventional marriage both as a form of legalism from which Christians should be free and as a selfish institution in which men exerted rights of ownership over women&quot;. He found scriptural justification: &quot;In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels in heaven&quot; (Matt. 22:30). Noyes also supported eugenics; and only certain people (including Noyes himself) were allowed to become parents. Another movement was established in Berlin Heights, Ohio.

In 1852, a writer named Marx Edgeworth Lazarus published a tract entitled &quot;Love vs. Marriage pt. 1&quot;, in which he portrayed marriage as &quot;incompatible with social harmony and the root cause of mental and physical impairments.&quot; Lazarus intertwined his writings with his religious teachings, a factor that made the Christian community more tolerable to the free love idea. Elements of the free-love movement also had links to abolitionist movements, drawing parallels between slavery and &quot;sexual slavery&quot; (marriage), and forming alliances with black activists.

American feminist Victoria Woodhull (1838–1927), the first woman to run for presidency in the U.S., in 1872, was also called &quot;the high priestess of free love&quot;. In 1871, Woodhull wrote: &quot;Yes, I am a Free Lover. I have an inalienable, constitutional and natural right to love whom I may, to love as long or as short a period as I can; to change that love every day if I please, and with that right neither you nor any law you can frame have any right to interfere&quot;.

The women&#x27;s suffrage movement, free love and Spiritualism were three strongly linked movements at the time, and Woodhull was also a spiritualist leader. Like Noyes, she also supported eugenics. Fellow social reformer and educator Mary Gove Nichols was happily married (to her second husband), and together they published a newspaper and wrote medical books and articles. Both Woodhull and Nichols eventually repudiated free love.

Publications of the movement in the second half of the 19th century included Nichols&#x27; Monthly, &quot;The Social Revolutionist&quot;, &quot;Woodhull &amp; Claflin&#x27;s Weekly&quot; (ed. Victoria Woodhull and her sister Tennessee Claflin), &quot;The Word&quot; (ed. Ezra Heywood), &quot;Lucifer, the Light-Bearer&quot; (ed. Moses Harman) and the German-language Detroit newspaper &quot;Der Arme Teufel&quot; (ed. Robert Reitzel). Organisations included the New England Free Love League, founded with the assistance of American libertarian socialist Benjamin Tucker as a spin-off from the New England Labor Reform League (NELRL). A minority of freethinkers also supported free love.

The most radical free love journal was &quot;The Social Revolutionist&quot;, published in 1856–1857 by John Patterson. The first volume consisted of twenty writers, of which only one was a woman.

Sex radicals were not alone in their fight against marriage ideals. Some other nineteenth-century Americans saw this social institution as flawed, but hesitated to abolish it. Groups such as the Shakers, the Oneida Community, and the Latter-day Saints were wary of the social notion of marriage. These organizations and sex radicals believed that true equality would never exist between the sexes as long as the church and the state continued to work together, worsening the problem of subordination of wives to their husbands.

Free-love movements continued into the early 20th century in bohemian circles in New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village. A group of Villagers lived free-love ideals and promoted them in the political journal &quot;The Masses&quot; and its sister publication &quot;The Little Review,&quot; a literary journal. Incorporating influences from the writings of the English thinkers and activists Edward Carpenter and Havelock Ellis, women such as Emma Goldman campaigned for a range of sexual freedoms, including homosexuality and access to contraception. Other notable figures among the Greenwich-Village scene who have been associated with free love include Edna St. Vincent Millay, Max Eastman, Crystal Eastman, Floyd Dell, Mabel Dodge Luhan, Ida Rauh, Hutchins Hapgood, and Neith Boyce. Dorothy Day also wrote passionately in defense of free love, women&#x27;s rights, and contraception—but later, after converting to Catholicism, she criticized the sexual revolution of the sixties.

The development of the idea of free love in the United States was also significantly impacted by the publisher of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, Hugh Hefner, whose activities and persona over more than a half century popularized the idea of free love to some of the general public.

====United Kingdom====

Free love was a central tenet of the philosophy of the Fellowship of the New Life, founded in 1883 by the Scottish intellectual Thomas Davidson. Fellowship members included many illustrious intellectuals of the day, who went on to radically challenge accepted Victorian notions of morality and sexuality, including poets Edward Carpenter and John Davidson, animal rights activist Henry Stephens Salt, sexologist Havelock Ellis, feminists Edith Lees, Emmeline Pankhurst and Annie Besant and writers H. G. Wells, Bernard Shaw, Bertrand Russell and Olive Schreiner. Its objective was &quot;The cultivation of a perfect character in each and all,&quot; and believed in the transformation of society through setting an example of clean simplified living for others to follow. Many of the Fellowship&#x27;s members advocated pacifism, vegetarianism and simple living.

Edward Carpenter was an early activist for the rights of homosexuals. He became interested in progressive education, especially providing information to young people on the topic of sexual education. For Carpenter, sexual education meant forwarding a clear analysis of the ways in which sex and gender were used to oppress women, contained in Carpenter&#x27;s radical work &quot;Love&#x27;s Coming-of-Age&quot;. In it he argued that a just and equal society must promote the sexual and economic freedom of women. The main crux of his analysis centred on the negative effects of the institution of marriage. He regarded marriage in England as both enforced celibacy and a form of prostitution.

The best-known British advocate of free love was the philosopher Bertrand Russell, later Third Earl Russell, who said that he did not believe he really knew a woman until he had made love with her. Russell consistently addressed aspects of free love throughout his voluminous writings, and was not personally content with conventional monogamy until extreme old age. His most famous work on the subject was &quot;Marriage and Morals&quot;, published in 1929. The book heavily criticizes the Victorian notions of morality regarding sex and marriage. Russell argued that the laws and ideas about sex of his time were a potpourri from various sources, which were no longer valid with the advent of contraception, as the sexual acts are now separated from the conception. He argued that family is most important for the welfare of children, and as such, a man and a woman should be considered bound only after her first pregnancy.

&quot;Marriage and Morals&quot; prompted vigorous protests and denunciations against Russell shortly after the book&#x27;s publication. A decade later, the book cost him his professorial appointment at the City College of New York due to a court judgment that his opinions made him &quot;morally unfit&quot; to teach. Contrary to what many people believed, Russell did not advocate an extreme libertine position. Instead, he felt that sex, although a natural impulse like hunger or thirst, involves more than that, because no one is &quot;satisfied by the bare sexual act&quot;. He argued that abstinence enhances the pleasure of sex, which is better when it &quot;has a large psychical element than when it is purely physical&quot;.

Russell noted that for a marriage to work requires that there &quot;be a feeling of complete equality on both sides; there must be no interference with mutual freedom; there must be the most complete physical and mental intimacy; and there must be a certain similarity in regard to standards of value&quot;. He argued that it was, in general, impossible to sustain this mutual feeling for an indefinite length of time, and that the only option in such a case was to provide for either the easy availability of divorce, or the social sanction of extra-marital sex.

Russell&#x27;s view on marriage changed as he went through personal struggles of subsequent marriages; in his autobiography he writes, &quot;I do not know what I think now about the subject of marriage. There seem to be insuperable objections to every general theory about it. Perhaps easy divorce causes less unhappiness than any other system, but I am no longer capable of being dogmatic on the subject of marriage.&quot;

Russell was also a very early advocate of repealing sodomy laws.

====France====
An important propagandist of free love was individualist anarchist Émile Armand. He advocated naturism and polyamory in what he termed &quot;la camaraderie amoureuse&quot;. He wrote many propagandist articles on this subject such as &quot;De la liberté sexuelle&quot; (1907) where he advocated not only a vague free love but also multiple partners, which he called &quot;plural love&quot;. In the individualist anarchist journal &quot;L&#x27;en dehors&quot; he and others continued in this way. Armand seized this opportunity to outline his theses supporting revolutionary sexualism and camaraderie amoureuse that differed from the traditional views of the partisans of free love in several respects.

Later Armand submitted that from an individualist perspective nothing was reprehensible about making &quot;love&quot;, even if one did not have very strong feelings for one&#x27;s partner. &quot;The camaraderie amoureuse thesis&quot;, he explained, &quot;entails a free contract of association (that may be annulled without notice, following prior agreement) reached between anarchist individualists of different genders, adhering to the necessary standards of sexual hygiene, with a view toward protecting the other parties to the contract from certain risks of the amorous experience, such as rejection, rupture, exclusivism, possessiveness, unicity, coquetry, whims, indifference, flirtatiousness, disregard for others, and prostitution.&quot; He also published &quot;Le Combat contre la jalousie et le sexualisme révolutionnaire&quot; (1926), followed over the years by &quot;Ce que nous entendons par liberté de l&#x27;amour&quot; (1928), &quot;La Camaraderie amoureuse ou &quot;chiennerie sexuelle&quot;&quot; (1930), and, finally, &quot;La Révolution sexuelle et la camaraderie amoureuse&quot; (1934), a book of nearly 350 pages comprising most of his writings on sexuality. In a text from 1937, he mentioned among the individualist objectives the practice of forming voluntary associations for purely sexual purposes of heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual nature or of a combination thereof.

He also supported the right of individuals to change sex and stated his willingness to rehabilitate forbidden pleasures, non-conformist caresses (he was personally inclined toward voyeurism), as well as sodomy. This led him to allocate more and more space to what he called &quot;the sexual non-conformists&quot;, while excluding physical violence. His militancy also included translating texts from people such as Alexandra Kollontai and Wilhelm Reich and establishments of free love associations which tried to put into practice &quot;la camaraderie amoureuse&quot; through actual sexual experiences.

Free love advocacy groups active during this time included the &quot;Association d&#x27;Études sexologiques&quot; and the &quot;Ligue mondiale pour la Réforme sexuelle sur une base scientifique&quot;.

====USSR====
After the October Revolution in Russia, Alexandra Kollontai became the most prominent woman in the Soviet administration. Kollontai was also a champion of free love. However, Clara Zetkin recorded that Lenin opposed free love as &quot;completely un-Marxist, and moreover, anti-social&quot;. Zetkin also recounted Lenin&#x27;s denunciation of plans to organise Hamburg&#x27;s women prostitutes into a &quot;special revolutionary militant section&quot;: he saw this as &quot;corrupt and degenerate&quot;.

Despite the traditional marital lives of Lenin and most Bolsheviks, they believed that sexual relations were outside the jurisdiction of the state. The Soviet government abolished centuries-old Czarist regulations on personal life, which had prohibited homosexuality and made it difficult for women to obtain divorce permits or to live singly. However, by the end of the 1920s, Stalin had taken control of the Communist Party and begun to implement socially conservative policies. Homosexuality was classified as a mental disorder, and free love was further demonized.

===Recent===

With the Summer of Love in 1967, the eccentricities of the beat generation became a nationally recognized movement. Despite the developing sexual revolution and the influence of the Beatniks in this new counterculture social rebellion, it has been acknowledged that the New Left movement was arguably the most prominent advocate of free love during the late 1960s. Many among the counterculture youth sided with New Left arguments that marriage was a symbol of the traditional capitalist culture which supported war. &quot;Make Love Not War&quot; became a popular slogan in the counterculture movement which denounced both war and capitalism. Images from the pro-socialist May 1968 uprising in France, which occurred as the anti-war protests were escalating throughout the United States, would provide a significant source of morale to the New Left cause as well.

Canadian Justice Minister, and future Prime Minister, Pierre Elliot Trudeau&#x27;s 20 December 1967 statement &quot;there&#x27;s no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation&quot; was a very public declaration justifying his government&#x27;s decriminalization of sexual activity between same sex partners in Canada, following 1967&#x27;s Summer of Love.

<text>Abraham Fortas (June 19, 1910 – April 5, 1982) was an American lawyer and jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1965 to 1969. Born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, Fortas graduated from Rhodes College and Yale Law School. He later became a law professor at Yale Law School and then an advisor for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Fortas worked at the Department of the Interior under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and was appointed by President Harry S. Truman to delegations that helped set up the United Nations in 1945.

In 1948, Fortas represented Lyndon B. Johnson in the dispute over the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination, and he formed close ties with Johnson. Fortas also represented Clarence Earl Gideon before the U.S. Supreme Court, in the landmark case Gideon v. Wainwright involving the right to counsel. Nominated by Johnson to the Supreme Court in 1965, Fortas was confirmed by the Senate, and maintained a close working relationship with the president. As a justice, Fortas wrote several landmark opinions in cases such as &quot;In re Gault&quot; and &quot;Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District&quot;.

In 1968, Johnson tried to elevate Fortas to the position of Chief Justice of the United States, but that nomination faced a filibuster and was withdrawn. Fortas later resigned from the Court after a controversy involving his acceptance of $20,000 from financier Louis Wolfson while Wolfson was being investigated for insider trading. The Justice Department investigated Fortas at the behest of President Richard Nixon. Attorney General John N. Mitchell pressured Fortas into resigning. Following his resignation, Fortas returned to private practice, occasionally appearing before the justices with whom he had served.

==Early years==
Fortas was born the youngest of five children to Orthodox Jewish immigrants Woolfe Fortas and Rachel &quot;Ray&quot; Berzansky Fortas in Memphis, Tennessee. Woolfe was born in Russia, and Rachel was born in Lithuania. Woolfe was a cabinetmaker, and the couple operated a store together. Fortas acquired a lifelong love for music from his father, who encouraged his playing the violin, and was known in Memphis as &quot;Fiddlin&#x27; Abe Fortas&quot;. Fortas learned to play the violin from local Catholic nuns at the St. Patrick&#x27;s School on Linden, a block from his house on Pontotoc Street; he then studied chamber music with the leader of a local trio. Fortas attended South Side High School where, at the age of sixteen, he graduated second in his class in 1926. After graduating from high school, Fortas won a scholarship to attend Southwestern at Memphis, a liberal arts college now called Rhodes College. During his college years, Fortas supported himself by working as a shoe salesman and as a performing violinist, while also giving violin lessons to local children. Initially, Fortas considered studying music, before settling on English and political science. He graduated first in his class in 1930.

Fortas earned scholarships from both Harvard Law School and Yale Law School but ultimately decided to attend Yale, becoming the youngest law student there at 20 years old. He became editor-in-chief of the &quot;Yale Law Journal &quot;and graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; and second in the class of 1933. One of his professors, William O. Douglas, was impressed with Fortas, and Douglas arranged for Fortas to stay at Yale to become an assistant professor of law.

Shortly thereafter, Fortas took on a series of government positions, including with the Agricultural Adjustment Administration and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in Washington, D.C. In 1937, he was made assistant director of the public utilities division at the SEC. Throughout this period, Fortas commuted between New Haven and Washington in order to fulfill his responsibilities both to Yale and to the government.

==Personal life==
In 1935, Fortas married Carolyn E. Agger, who became a successful tax lawyer. They had no children, and after his appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States, they lived at 3210 R Street NW in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C.

Just like his days in Memphis, Fortas was an amateur musician who played the violin in a string quartet, called the &quot;N Street Strictly-no-refunds String Quartet&quot; on Sunday evenings in Washington. Fortas was friends with well-known musicians such as Rudolf Serkin, Isaac Stern and Pablo Casals. Fortas was a good friend of the first democratically elected Governor of Puerto Rico, Luis Muñoz Marín, calling him &quot;a spectacularly great figure&quot;. Fortas visited the island often, frequently lobbied for the island&#x27;s interests in Congress, participated in drafting the Constitution of Puerto Rico, and gave legal advice to Marín&#x27;s administration whenever requested.

The Puerto Rican actor José Ferrer portrayed Fortas in the film &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Trumpet&quot; (1980).

==Early career==
Leaving Yale in 1939, Fortas served as general counsel of the Public Works Administration and then as Undersecretary of the Interior in Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s administration. While he was working at the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Secretary of the Interior, Harold L. Ickes, introduced him to a young congressman from Texas, Lyndon B. Johnson.

In October 1943, Fortas was granted a leave of absence from the Department of Interior to enlist in the United States Navy for World War II. Assigned to Naval Training Station Sampson, New York for his initial training, in December 1943 he was honorably discharged as the result of an arrested case of ocular tuberculosis that caused doctors to deem him medically unfit. He had resigned from his position at the Interior department while in the navy, but was reappointed in January 1944. In 1945, he was appointed by President Harry S. Truman as an advisor to the U.S. delegation during the organizational meeting of the United Nations (UN) in San Francisco, and at the 1946 General Assembly meeting in London.

==Private practice==
In 1946, after leaving government service, Fortas founded a law firm, Arnold &amp; Fortas, with Thurman Arnold. Former Federal Communications Commission commissioner Paul A. Porter joined the firm in 1947; in 1965, following the appointment of Fortas to the Supreme Court, the firm was renamed as Arnold &amp; Porter. For many years, it has remained one of Washington&#x27;s most influential law firms, and today is among the most profitable law firms in the world.

In the 1948 United States Senate election in Texas, Lyndon Johnson ran for the Democratic nomination for one of the two seats in the U.S. Senate from Texas. Johnson won the Democratic primary by only 87 votes. His opponent, former Governor of Texas Coke R. Stevenson, persuaded a federal judge to issue an order taking Johnson&#x27;s name off the general election ballot while the primary results were being contested. There were serious allegations of corruption in the voting process, including 200 votes for Johnson that had been cast in alphabetical order. Johnson asked Fortas for help, and Fortas persuaded Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black to overturn the ruling. Johnson then won the general election and became a U.S. Senator.

During the Red Scare of the late 1940s and early 1950s, Fortas came to widespread notice as the defense attorney for Owen Lattimore. In 1950, Fortas often clashed with Senator Joseph McCarthy when representing Lattimore before the Tydings Committee, and also before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee.

Fortas initially opposed the creation of a presidential commission to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. When it became clear that multiple investigations were gearing up simultaneously at the city, state, and federal levels, Fortas changed his mind and advised Johnson to establish the Warren Commission.

===&quot;Durham v. United States&quot;===
Fortas was known in Washington circles to have a serious interest in psychiatry, still a controversial subject at the time. In 1953, this expertise led to his appointment to represent the indigent Monte W. Durham, whose insanity defense had been rejected at trial two years earlier, before a U.S. Court of Appeals.

Durham&#x27;s defense had been denied because the District Court had applied the M&#x27;Naghten rules, requiring that the defense prove the accused did not know the difference between right and wrong for an insanity plea to be accepted. Adopted by the British House of Lords in 1843, generations before the origins of modern psychiatry, this test was still in common use in American courts over a century later.

The effect of this standard was to exclude psychiatric and psychological testimony almost entirely from the legal process. In a critical turning point for American criminal law, the Court of Appeals accepted Fortas&#x27;s call to abandon the M&#x27;Naghten Rule and to allow for testimony and evidence regarding the defendant&#x27;s mental state.

===&quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot;===
In 1963, Fortas represented Clarence Earl Gideon in his appeal before the Supreme Court. Gideon had been convicted by a Florida court of breaking into a pool hall. He could not afford a lawyer, and none was provided for him when he asked for one at trial. In its landmark ruling in &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot;, the Supreme Court held for Gideon, ruling that state courts are required under the Sixth Amendment to provide counsel in criminal cases for defendants unable to afford their own. Fortas&#x27;s former Yale Law School professor, longtime friend and future Supreme Court colleague, William O. Douglas praised his argument as &quot;probably the best single legal argument&quot; in Douglas&#x27;s time on the court.

==Associate Justice of the Supreme Court==
On July 28, 1965, President Johnson nominated Fortas as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, to succeed Arthur Goldberg, who had resigned to become the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations following the death of Adlai Stevenson. Johnson persuaded Goldberg to leave the Court for the U.N. in part because he wanted Fortas on the Court. Johnson thought that some of his &quot;Great Society&quot; reforms could be ruled unconstitutional by the Court and felt that Fortas would let him know if that was to happen. The nomination was given a favorable recommendation by the Senate Judiciary Committee two weeks later, following a one-day public hearing. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 11, 1965, and took the judicial oath of office on October 4, 1965. His appointment ensured the continuation of the Warren Court&#x27;s liberal majority.

The seat Fortas occupied on the Court had come to be informally known as the &quot;Jewish seat,&quot; as his three immediate predecessors—Goldberg, Felix Frankfurter and Benjamin Cardozo—were also Jewish.

Fortas continued to serve as an adviser to Johnson after becoming an associate justice. He attended White House staff meetings, advising the president on judicial nominations and discussing private Supreme Court deliberations with him. In 1966, he substantially edited an initial version of Johnson&#x27;s State of the Union Address.

In 1968, Fortas wrote a book called &quot;Concerning Dissent and Civil Disobedience&quot;.

Fortas&#x27;s law clerks included future Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Walter B. Slocombe and Martha A. Field, a scholar of constitutional law, family law, and bioethics.

=== FBI and Justice Fortas ===
In 1966, Justice Fortas informed the FBI and White House about the Fred B. Black, Jr. warrantless bugging case pending before the High Court. This included revealing conference room discussions, lobbying the justices in favor of the FBI position that this was Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s fault not J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s. This was done despite Fortas disqualifying himself from the case. The next year, Director Hoover both blackmailed and protected Justice Fortas after an allegation of sexual misconduct with a teenager. Fortas denied this allegation. Justice Fortas continued to rule on cases involving the FBI. 
=== Relationship with other justices ===
Fortas had mostly good working relations with his fellow justices, although they worried that he talked to President Johnson too much. Fortas clashed with his fellow Associate Justice Hugo Black during much of his time on the Court. The two had been friends since the 1930s, and Black helped convince Fortas&#x27;s wife, Carolyn Agger, to consent to his appointment to the Supreme Court. However, once both men were on the Court, they disagreed about the manner in which the Constitution should be interpreted, finding themselves on opposing sides of the Court&#x27;s opinions most of the time. In 1968, a Warren clerk called their feud &quot;one of the most basic animosities of the Court&quot;.

Fortas&#x27;s best relationship was with William O. Douglas, his former law professor at Yale. Fortas was also close to Associate Justice William J. Brennan and Chief Justice Earl Warren. Brennan&#x27;s offices were in the chambers next to those of Fortas. Fortas&#x27;s wife recalled that Fortas &quot;loved Warren&quot;.

Fortas called fellow associate justice John Marshall Harlan II &quot;one of my dearest friends, although we usually are on opposite sides of the issues here.&quot;

In 1967, Fortas and Douglas dissented in the 5–4 decision &quot;Fortson v. Morris&quot;, which cleared the path for the Georgia State Legislature to choose the Governor of Georgia in the deadlocked Georgia gubernatorial election of 1966 between the Democrat Lester Maddox and the Republican Howard Callaway. Fortas said that the State Constitution of 1824, allowing the legislature to choose the governor if no one wins a majority in the general election, was at odds with the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: In this case, Maddox trailed Callaway by about 3,000 votes.

Justice Black took the strict constructionist view that the U.S. Constitution does not dictate how a state must choose its governor: 

===Approach to oral arguments===

Fortas was critical of justices (he specifically cited Thurgood Marshall) who frequently broke into attorneys&#x27; arguments to ask questions. As an attorney arguing before the Court, he had resented intrusions by the justices and so as a justice himself, he felt it best to let the lawyers give their arguments uninterrupted.

===Children&#x27;s and students&#x27; rights===

During his time on the Court, Fortas led a revolution in children&#x27;s rights and juvenile justice, broadly extending the Court&#x27;s logic on due process rights and procedure to legal minors and overturning the existing paradigm of &quot;parens patriae&quot; in which the state had usurped the parental role. Writing the majority decision in &quot;Kent v. United States&quot; (1966), the first Supreme Court case that evaluated a juvenile court procedure, Fortas suggested that the existing system might be &quot;the worst of both worlds.&quot;

At that time, the state was held to have a paternal interest in the child rather than a prosecutorial one, a concept that dispensed with the obligation to provide a child accused of a crime with the opportunity to make a defense. Still, courts were empowered to decide, in the interests of the child, to have the child incarcerated for lengthy periods or otherwise severely punished.

Fortas elaborated on his critique the following year in the case of &quot;In re Gault&quot; (1967). The case concerned a 15-year-old who had been sentenced to almost six years (until his 21st birthday) in the Arizona State Industrial School for making an obscene phone call to his neighbor. Had he been an adult, the maximum punishment he could have received was a $50.00 fine or two months in jail. Fortas used the case to launch a ferocious attack on the juvenile justice system and &quot;parens patriae&quot;. His majority opinion was a landmark, extending the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s guarantees of right to sufficient notice, right to counsel, right to confrontation of witnesses, and right against self-incrimination to certain juvenile proceedings.

Two years later, Fortas wrote another landmark in students rights with the decision in the case of &quot;Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District&quot; (1969), involving two high school students and one junior high school student, who had been suspended for wearing black armbands to school to protest the Vietnam War. Fortas wrote that neither &quot;students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate&quot;.

===&quot;Epperson v. Arkansas&quot;===
In 1968, Fortas persuaded the court to accept the appeal of Little Rock Central High School teacher Sue Epperson who had challenged Arkansas&#x27;s anti-evolution law, with the support of the state teachers union. Epperson had won the case, but the Arkansas Supreme Court had overturned the ruling. Although the Court agreed quickly after hearing the case that the Arkansas ruling should be reversed, there was no consensus as to why, most Justices favoring fairly narrow grounds. Fortas was the architect and the author of the broader landmark majority opinion that emerged in &quot;Epperson v. Arkansas&quot;, banning religiously based creation narratives from public school science curricula.

===Presidential power===
Fortas believed in an expanded executive branch and a less powerful legislative branch. He wrote: &quot;The enormous growth of presidential power from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Lyndon Johnson was a necessary and an inevitable adaptation of our constitutional system to national needs.&quot;

===Nomination to be Chief Justice===
On June 26, 1968, Johnson nominated Fortas as Chief Justice of the United States, to succeed Earl Warren, who had submitted his resignation effective with the confirmation of a successor. Anticipating that conservative members of the Senate would have concerns about Fortas&#x27;s liberal opinions, Johnson simultaneously announced that he would fill the vacancy created by Fortas&#x27;s elevation with United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Judge Homer Thornberry of Texas. The propriety of the coordinated resignation-nomination on the eve of the November presidential election was called into question by Republican candidate Richard Nixon and the media. By the time the Judiciary Committee opened hearings on the nomination on July 11, bipartisan opposition to the nomination (among Republicans and Southern Democrats) had become well organized. Fortas was the first sitting associate justice, nominated for chief justice, ever to appear before the Senate. He underwent four days of questioning about his legal career, judicial philosophy, and his relationship with President Johnson. Judiciary Committee chairman James Eastland, a Mississippi segregationist, told Johnson he &quot;had never seen so much feeling against a man as against Fortas&quot;.

Antisemitism likely played a role in the confirmation battle. Afterward, Eastland reportedly said &quot;After [Thurgood] Marshall, I could not go back to Mississippi if a Jewish chief justice swore in the next president.&quot; The National Socialist White People&#x27;s Party undertook a phone campaign that summer, condemning Fortas as a &quot;despicable Jew with a &#x27;red&#x27; record that smells to high heaven&quot;. Such attacks were soundly condemned by most senators. Even so, the White House began alerting the press to growing antisemitic opposition against Fortas, and used the issue to garner support for him in the Senate. Fortas himself called the effort to defeat his nomination, &quot;anti-Negro, anti-liberal, anti-civil rights, [and] anti-Semitic&quot;.

====American University payments====
During the hearing preparations, it was revealed that Fortas had accepted $15,000 raised by private donors to teach nine summer seminars at American University&#x27;s Washington College of Law during his tenure as a justice. The money had come, not from the university, but from private sources that represented business interests connected to 40 companies; Senator Strom Thurmond raised the idea that cases involving these companies might come to the Court, and Fortas might not be objective. While the fee itself was legal, the size of the fee raised much concern about the Court&#x27;s insulation from private interests, especially as the speaking fee had been funded by former legal clients and partners of Fortas. The $15,000 represented more than 40 percent of a Supreme Court justice&#x27;s salary at the time, and was seven times what any other American University seminar leader had ever been paid.

====&quot;Fortas Film Festival&quot;====
Thurmond also hammered at the issue of pornography. He condemned Fortas for voting with the majority to overturn obscenity laws dealing with pornographic films. Thurmond obtained some of the films in question and played them in the Senate building while the hearings were out of session. These showings became known as the &quot;Fortas Film Festival&quot;, and the association of Fortas with some of the films&#x27; strip-teases and especially the rape or homosexual sex depicted in one film, &quot;Flaming Creatures&quot;, was effective in tarnishing Fortas&#x27;s image and disheartening his supporters.

====Cloture vote====
It was not until September 17 that the Judiciary Committee took a final vote on the nomination, reporting it favorably by an 11 to 6 vote to the full Senate. Thurmond promised to filibuster, and when the senate debate began on September 25, Fortas&#x27;s opponents restated every criticism they had earlier directed against Fortas, especially with regard to the issue of obscenity. Johnson remained resolute in his support for his nominee, saying to an aide: &quot;We won&#x27;t withdraw the nomination. I won&#x27;t do that to Abe.&quot;

The debate lasted for four days, until a cloture motion to end the debate was made. The 45–43 vote in favor of cloture demonstrated that the nomination was in trouble. It was 14 votes short of the two-thirds majority (59 votes) needed to cut off debate and force a vote on the nomination. (35 Democrats and 10 Republicans voted to end debate, while 24 Republicans and 19 Democrats voted to continue it.) Although the vote suggested to Fortas&#x27;s supporters that a slim majority favored confirmation, it effectively derailed the nomination. In light of the slim prospect for a positive outcome, Johnson withdrew Fortas&#x27;s nomination.

News accounts at the time consistently described the Senate floor debate as a filibuster intended to prevent the nomination from reaching the floor, where a simple majority vote would have been enough for confirmation. Republican Senator John Cornyn asserted in 2003, however, that several senators who opposed Fortas asserted at the time they were not conducting a perpetual filibuster and were not trying to prevent a final up-or-down vote from occurring. Public debate occasionally still occurs over whether Fortas would have been confirmed in a simple majority vote. The Fortas nomination is seen as a harbinger of later filibusters of judicial nominees.

Richard Nixon won the 1968 presidential election, and Johnson did not make another nomination before his term as president expired on January 20, 1969. Earl Warren was succeeded as chief justice by Warren Burger, who was sworn into office on June 23, 1969.

===Ethics scandal and resignation===
Fortas remained an associate justice, but in 1969, a new scandal arose. Fortas had accepted a US $20,000 () retainer from the family foundation of Wall Street financier Louis Wolfson, a friend and former client, in January 1966. In return for unspecified advice, it was to pay Fortas $20,000 a year for the rest of Fortas&#x27;s life (and then pay his widow for the rest of her life). However, in order to avoid apparent impropriety, Fortas returned the money the same year and received no further payments. Fortas was not unique in receiving this type of funding and other Justices had similar arrangements. William O. Douglas, Fortas&#x27;s mentor, likewise received funding from casino magnate Albert Parvin through his own foundation. The American Bar Association revamped its rules as a result of the Wolfson affair, revising circumstances under which judges should not accept outside income.

Wolfson was under investigation for securities violations at the time, and it was alleged that he expected that his arrangement with Fortas would help him stave off criminal charges or help him secure a presidential pardon. He asked Fortas to help him secure a pardon from Johnson, which Fortas claimed that he did not do. Fortas recused himself from Wolfson&#x27;s case when it came before the Court.

In May 1969, &quot;Life&quot; magazine chronicled Fortas&#x27;s tangled relations with Wolfson. The revelation engendered calls for Fortas to be impeached, and motivated Richard Nixon, who knew that Fortas&#x27;s resignation would enable the appointment of a more conservative Justice, to order the Justice Department to investigate Fortas. Nixon was unsure if an investigation or prosecution was legal, but was convinced by then-Assistant Attorney General and future Chief Justice William Rehnquist that it would be.

Chief Justice Earl Warren (who, like the other Justices, was unaware of Nixon&#x27;s actions) urged Fortas to resign to protect the reputation of the Court and avoid impeachment proceedings, as did Justice Hugo Black. However, when Fortas said it would &quot;kill&quot; his wife, Black changed his mind, realized that Nixon wanted Fortas off the Court for political reasons, and urged Fortas not to resign.

Fortas ultimately decided resignation would be best for him and for his wife&#x27;s legal career after Attorney General John N. Mitchell threatened to prosecute him, and potentially investigate his wife for tax evasion. On the subject of his resignation, Justice William J. Brennan later said, &quot;We were just stunned.&quot; Fortas later said he &quot;resigned to save Douglas,&quot; another justice who was being investigated for a similar scandal at the same time.

Fortas resigned from the Court on May 14, 1969. When the Justice Department heard the news, the Attorney General&#x27;s office celebrated, and Nixon called to congratulate them.

Fortas&#x27;s seat on the Supreme Court was vacant until June 1970, when Harry Blackmun was sworn into office. This was Nixon&#x27;s third attempt to fill the vacancy. His earlier failed nominations were of Clement Haynsworth in September 1969 and G. Harrold Carswell in February 1970.

Seven years later in 1977, Wolfson&#x27;s lawyer Bernard Fensterwald disclosed to &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter Bob Woodward that Wolfson had surreptitiously recorded a 1970 phone call with Fortas, also giving the &quot;Post&quot; the transcript of this phone call. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; subsequently published several excerpts, including language suggesting that Fortas might have indeed spoken with President Johnson about a pardon for Wolfson, but there was no direct evidence that it was a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; rather than a voluntary intervention for a friend. Wolfson was convicted of violating federal securities laws later that year and spent time in prison.

==Later years==
Rebuffed in the wake of his fall by the powerful Washington law firm he had founded, Fortas founded another firm, Fortas &amp; Koven, and maintained a successful law practice until his death in 1982. However, his wife, Carolyn Agger, stayed at Fortas&#x27;s original firm—Fortas had resigned in order to protect her job there. He turned down an offer to publish his memoirs.

At Fortas &amp; Koven, Fortas also kept two notable non-paying clients: preeminent cellist/composer Pablo Casals and Lyndon Johnson. Johnson and Fortas remained great friends, with the latter often visiting the former president at his ranch near Stonewall, Texas, until his death in 1973. Fortas was asked to donate his papers to Johnson&#x27;s presidential library by Lady Bird Johnson, but he replied that his correspondence with Johnson had always been kept in strictest confidence.

A portrait of him was placed in Yale Law School while he was still alive, underwritten by an anonymous donor. Fortas served as a longtime member of the board of directors of Carnegie Hall, including while he was on the Supreme Court. He also served on the board of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts since the inauguration of the project in 1964.

In the course of his return to private practice, Fortas sometimes appeared before his former colleagues at the Supreme Court. On the first occasion he did so, his successor, Harry Blackmun, recalled that his eyes met Fortas&#x27;s: &quot;[Fortas] kind of nodded ... I wondered what was going through his mind&quot;. When Blackmun later questioned Fortas if he remembered the encounter, Fortas said he would &quot;never forget it&quot;. Blackmun thought Fortas&#x27;s attitude toward the new justice was remarkable, not showing &quot;an ounce of antagonism or resentment.&quot;

Fortas died from a ruptured aorta on April 5, 1982. His memorial service was held at the Kennedy Center with Isaac Stern and Lady Bird Johnson in attendance.

<doc id="250556" wikidata="Q886543" url="?curid=250556" title="Vacutainer">
<text>A vacutainer blood collection tube is a sterile glass or plastic test tube with a colored rubber stopper creating a vacuum seal inside of the tube, facilitating the drawing of a predetermined volume of liquid. Vacutainer tubes may contain additives designed to stabilize and preserve the specimen prior to analytical testing. Tubes are available with a safety-engineered stopper, with a variety of labeling options and draw volumes. The color of the top indicates the additives in the vial.

Vacutainer tubes were invented by Joseph Kleiner in 1949. &quot;Vacutainer&quot; is a registered trademark of Becton Dickinson, which manufactures and sells the tubes today.

==Principles==
The Vacutainer needle is double-ended: the inner end is encased in a thin rubber coating that prevents blood from leaking out if the Vacutainer tubes are changed during a multi-draw, and the outer end which is inserted into the vein. When the needle is screwed into the translucent plastic needle holder, the coated end is inside the holder.

When a tube is inserted into the holder, its rubber cap is punctured by this inner needle and the vacuum in the tube pulls blood through the needle and into the tube. The filled tube is then removed and another can be inserted and filled the same way. The amount of air evacuated from the tube predetermines how much blood will fill the tube before blood stops flowing.

Each tube is topped with a color-coded plastic or rubber cap. Tubes often include additives that mix with the blood when collected, and the color of each tube&#x27;s plastic cap indicates which additives it contains.

Blood collection tubes expire because over time the vacuum is lost and blood will not be drawn into the tube when the needle punctures the cap.

== Types of tubes ==
Vacutainer tubes may contain additional substances that preserve blood for processing in a medical laboratory. Using the wrong tube may make the blood sample unusable for the intended purpose. These additives are typically thin film coatings applied using an ultrasonic nozzle.

The additives may include anticoagulants (EDTA, sodium citrate, heparin) or a gel with density between those of blood cells and blood plasma. Additionally, some tubes contain additives that preserve certain components of or substances within the blood, such as glucose. When a tube is centrifuged, the materials within are separated by density, with the blood cells sinking to the bottom and the plasma or serum accumulating at the top. Tubes containing gel can be easily handled and transported after centrifugation without the blood cells and serum mixing.
The meanings of the various colors are standardized by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and are the same across manufacturers.

The term &quot;order of draw&quot; refers to the sequence in which tubes should be filled. The needle which pierces the tubes can carry additives from one tube into the next, so the sequence is standardized so that any cross-contamination of additives will not affect laboratory results.
==History==
Vacutainer technology was developed in 1947 by Joseph Kleiner, and is currently marketed by Becton Dickinson (B-D). The Vacutainer was preceded by other vacuum-based phlebotomy technology such as the Keidel vacuum.

The plastic tube version, known as Vacutainer PLUS, was developed at B-D in the early 1990s by E. Vogler, D. Montgomery and G. Harper amongst others of the Surface Science Group as US patents 5344611, 5326535, 5320812, 5257633 and 5246666.

Vacutainers are widely used in phlebotomy in developed countries due to safety and ease of use. Vacutainers have the advantage of being prepared with additives, allowing easy multi-tube draws, and having a lower chance of hemolysis. In developing countries, it is still common to draw blood using a syringe or syringes. Many brands have now started manufacturing Vaccutainer such as Vacu-8, Hemo Tube and Hemo Vac Plus. These tubes are now also available in pre-barcoded forms.

<doc id="250558" wikidata="Q240923" url="?curid=250558" title="Souvlaki">
<text>Souvlaki (, , ; plural: , ) is a Greek fast food consisting of small pieces of meat and sometimes vegetables grilled on a skewer. It is usually eaten straight off the skewer while still hot. It can be served with or inside a rolled pita, typically with lemon, sauces, vegetables such as sliced tomato and onion, and fried potatoes as a side. The meat usually used in Greece and Cyprus is pork.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;souvlaki&quot; is a diminutive of the Medieval Greek ( meaning &quot;skewer&quot;) itself borrowed from Latin . &quot;Souvlaki&quot; is the common term in Macedonia and other regions of northern Greece, while in southern Greece and around Athens it is commonly known as &quot;kalamaki&quot; ( meaning &quot;small reed&quot;).

==History==
In Greek culture, the practice of cooking food on spits or skewers dates to the Bronze Age. Excavations in Santorini, Greece, unearthed sets of stone cooking supports used by the natives of the island before the Thera eruption of the 17th century BC; souvlaki was &quot;a popular delicacy in Santorini back in 2000 BC&quot;. In the stone cooking supports, there are pairs of indentations that were likely used for holding skewers and the line of holes in the base allowed the coals to be supplied with air. 

In Mycenaean Greece, &quot;souvlaki trays&quot; were discovered in Gla, Mycenae, and Pylos. The &quot;souvlaki trays&quot; (or portable grills) used by the Mycenaean Greeks were rectangular ceramic pans that sat underneath skewers of meat. It is not clear whether these trays would have been placed directly over a fire or if the pans would have held hot coals like a portable barbecue pit. Spit supports appear to &quot;continue in use into the Early Iron Age at Nichoria&quot;. In Greek literature, Homer in the &quot;Iliad&quot; (1.465) mentions pieces of meat roasted on spits (ὀβελός); this is also mentioned in the works of Aristophanes, Xenophon, Aristotle, and others. In Classical Greece, a small spit or skewer was known as (), and Aristophanes mentions such skewers being used to roast thrushes.

In the Byzantine Empire, the Greek author of the &quot;Prodromic Poems&quot; (4.231) mentions &quot;the hot meat shops&quot; of Constantinople providing clients with spit-roasting meat slices similar to souvlaki known as .

Modern-day &quot;souvlaki&quot; was described by Gustave Flaubert, a French traveler, who observed Greeks &quot;grilling pieces of meat on a bamboo stick&quot; during his visit to the Boeotian countryside of southern Central Greece in 1850. However, modern-day souvlaki was not widely distributed in Greece until after World War II. Souvlaki skewers served as fast food started to be sold widely in the 1960s, after being introduced by vendors from Boeotia. The first known use of the word &quot;souvlaki&quot; in English was in 1942.

==Variations==


===Kalamaki===
&quot;Kalamaki&quot; ( meaning &quot;small reed&quot;) is a synonym for souvlaki proper in Athens where the word &quot;souvlaki&quot; is used colloquially for any kind of pita wraps. Kalamaki can also be accompanied with vegetables such as tomato, peppers, and onions, and a sauce, with lemon wedges. There are some places in Greece where kalamaki is not connected in any way to souvlaki such as Thessaloniki; in these regions, souvlaki refers to the dish that in Athens is called kalamaki.

===Souvlaki-merida===
&quot;Merída&quot; (μερίδα) means &quot;portion&quot; in Greek. While souvlaki is eaten plain as a fast food, it is also served as a full plate, served with fried potatoes, vegetables, sauce, and quartered pita bread. Usually it consists of the ingredients of a souvlaki-pita (see below) laid out on a plate. Lamb is mostly used, but others can be used, such as ox.

===Souvlaki pita===
Souvlaki-pita consists of grilled souvlaki meat folded in a lightly grilled pita along with sliced tomatoes and onions, and tzatziki sauce, and fried potatoes on the side – though increasingly they may be added to the folded pita. This variation is prominent at outlets run by Melbourne&#x27;s Greek-Australian community. 

In some areas, when chicken is used instead of pork, tzatziki and onions are replaced with a special yellow mustard sauce and lettuce. Other garnishes and sauces include ktipiti, Russian salad, and melitzanosalata.

===Corfu===
In Corfu, a special tomato sauce is added to souvlaki, plainly called &quot;red sauce&quot; ().

===Cyprus===
In Cyprus, souvlaki can refer both to the small chunks of meat on a skewer, and to the dish. It is made with a large pita that has a pocket-style opening. Into this is placed the meat (traditionally lamb or pork, more recently sheftalia or chicken), which in Cypriot souvlaki is cut into slightly larger chunks. Tomatoes, cucumbers and shredded white cabbage are the usual salad additions. Onion, parsley, and pickled green chili peppers are common accompaniments, as are yogurt and tzatziki. Cut lemons are always included with souvlaki, as they are with all grilled meats in Cyprus. Lettuce is not traditional and is seldom used in souvlaki outside of tourist resorts.

<text>Duel is a 1971 American road action-thriller television film directed by Steven Spielberg. It centers on a traveling salesman David Mann (Dennis Weaver) driving his car through rural California to meet a client. However, he finds himself chased and terrorized by the mostly unseen driver of a semi-truck. The screenplay by Richard Matheson adapts his own short story of the same name, published in the April 1971 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;iplayboy/19710401&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and based on an encounter on November 22, 1963, when a trucker dangerously cut him off on a California freeway.&lt;ref name=&quot;amblin/duel&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bouzereau/Matheson&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Produced by Universal Television, &quot;Duel&quot; originally aired as a part of the &quot;ABC Movie of the Week&quot; series on November 13, 1971. It later received an international theatrical release by Universal Pictures in an extended version featuring scenes shot after the film&#x27;s original TV broadcast. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with Spielberg&#x27;s direction being singled out for praise. It has since been recognized as an influential cult classic and one of the greatest films ever made for television.

==Plot==
David Mann is a middle-aged salesman driving on a business trip. He encounters a dilapidated tank truck in the Mojave Desert. Mann passes the truck, but the truck speeds up and roars past him. When Mann overtakes and passes it again, the truck blasts its horn. Mann leaves it in the distance.

Mann pulls into a gas station, and shortly after the truck arrives and parks next to him. Mann phones his wife, who is upset after their previous night&#x27;s argument. The station attendant tells Mann he needs a new radiator hose but Mann declines the repair.

Back on the road, the truck catches up, passes then blocks Mann whenever he attempts to pass. After antagonizing Mann for some time, the driver waves him past, but Mann nearly hits an oncoming vehicle. Mann then passes the truck using an unpaved turnout next to the highway.

The truck tailgates Mann at increasingly high speed. Mann loses control and crashes into a fence across from a diner. The truck continues down the road. Mann enters the restaurant to compose himself. He sees the truck parked outside. He studies the patrons and confronts one he believes to be the truck driver. The offended patron beats Mann and leaves in a different truck. The pursuing truck leaves seconds later, indicating its driver was never inside the diner.

Mann leaves and stops to help a stranded school bus but his front bumper gets caught underneath the bus&#x27;s rear bumper. The truck appears at the end of a tunnel. Mann and the bus driver free his car and Mann flees. Shortly after down the road, Mann stops at a railroad crossing waiting for a freight train to pass through. The truck appears from behind and pushes Mann&#x27;s car toward the oncoming freight train. The train passes, and Mann crosses the tracks and pulls over. The truck continues down the road and Mann slowly follows.

In an attempt to create more distance between him and the truck, Mann drives at a very leisurely pace as other motorists pass him. Once again, he encounters the truck which has pulled off to the side of the road ahead, intentionally waiting for Mann. He pulls out in front of him and starts antagonizing him again.

Mann stops at a gas station/ roadside animal attraction to call the police and replace his radiator hose. When he steps into the phone booth, the truck drives into it. Mann jumps clear just in time. The station owner cries out as the truck destroys her animals&#x27; cages. Mann jumps into his car and speeds away. Around a corner he pulls off the road, hiding behind an embankment as the truck drives past.

After a long wait, Mann heads off again, but the truck is waiting down the road. Mann attempts to speed past but the truck blocks the road. Mann seeks help from an elderly couple in a car, but they flee when the truck backs up towards them at speed. The truck stops before hitting Mann&#x27;s car; Mann speeds past the truck, which begins pursuing. Mann swerves toward what he believes is a police car, only to see it is a pest control vehicle. The truck chases him up a mountain range. The radiator hose of Mann&#x27;s car breaks and the car overheats. He barely makes the summit and coasts downhill in neutral as the truck follows.

Mann spins out and crashes into a cliff wall and barely escapes being crushed by the truck but restarts his car. He drives up a dirt road with the truck following. He turns to face the truck in front of a canyon. He wedges his briefcase onto the accelerator and steers the car into the oncoming truck, jumping free at the last moment. The truck hits the car, which bursts into flames, obscuring the driver&#x27;s view. The truck and car plunge over the cliff. Above the wreckage, Mann celebrates. He then sits at the cliff&#x27;s edge and throws stones into the canyon as the sun sets.

==Production==
=== Development ===
Richard Matheson adapted the script from his own short story,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright/Spielberg&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which was originally published in the March 1971 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. Matheson got the inspiration for the story when he was tailgated by a trucker while on his way home from a golfing match, on the then two-lane Highway 126 in Fillmore, California, with friend Jerry Sohl on November 22, 1963, the same day as the John F. Kennedy assassination. After a series of unsuccessful attempts to pitch the idea as an episode for various television series, he decided to write it as a short story instead. In preparation for writing the story, he drove from his home to Ventura and recorded everything he saw on a tape recorder.

The original short story was given to Spielberg by his secretary Nona Tyson, who told him that it was being made into a &quot;Movie of the Week&quot; for ABC with producer George Eckstein, and she suggested he apply to be the director; she told Spielberg to read the story, which he liked. &quot;Duel&quot; was Spielberg&#x27;s second feature-length directing effort, after &quot;L.A. 2017&quot;, a 1971 episode of the NBC television series &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;. Spielberg showed Eckstein a rough cut of &quot;Murder by the Book&quot;, an episode of &quot;Columbo&quot; directed by Spielberg that had not yet aired (it aired on September 15, 1971, two months before the release of &quot;Duel&quot;).

Much of the movie was filmed in and around the communities of Canyon Country, Agua Dulce, and Acton, California. In particular, sequences were filmed on the Sierra Highway, Agua Dulce Canyon Road, Soledad Canyon Road, and Angeles Forest Highway. Spielberg insisted on shooting outside, contrary to the request of unit production manager, Wallace Worsley, who felt that the film could not be shot efficiently on the budget and time provided. As a compromise, he allowed Spielberg to start the filming on location for the first three days to see if it really could be done on an efficient level. To help with plotting, he made an overhead map to help plot out the camera shots. Principal photography began on September 13, 1971. Shooting lasted 13 days. Three more days were needed for additional scenes.

Many of the landmarks from &quot;Duel&quot; still exist today, including the tunnel, the railroad crossing, and Chuck&#x27;s Café, where Mann stops for a break. The café building is still on Sierra Highway, but has housed a French restaurant called &#x27;Le Chêne&#x27; since 1986. The cliffs where the truck crashes at the end are Mystery Mesa, off Vasquez Canyon Road.

Production of the television film was overseen by ABC&#x27;s director of movies of the week Lillian Gallo. Filming was completed on October 4, 1971 in thirteen days—three longer than the schedule—which left ten days for editing prior to broadcast.

Spielberg lobbied for Dennis Weaver to star in the movie because he admired Weaver&#x27;s work in Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;. Weaver repeats one of his lines from &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; in &quot;Duel&quot;, telling the truck driver in the café that he has &quot;another thing coming&quot;.

Interviewed by Weaver for the Archive of American Television, Spielberg said, &quot;You know, I watch that movie at least twice a year to remember what I did&quot;.

===Truck as antagonist===
Matheson&#x27;s script made it clear that the truck driver would be unseen aside from the few shots of his arms and boots that were necessary to the plot. Specifically, the driver&#x27;s arms are shown twice, motioning Mann ahead, and his leather boots are shown in the gas station scene near the beginning of the film. His motives are never revealed. In a DVD documentary feature, Spielberg observes that fear of the unknown is perhaps the greatest fear of all, and &quot;Duel&quot; plays heavily to that fear; the effect of not seeing the driver makes the real antagonist of the film the truck itself.

===Vehicles===
The car driven by Mann is a red Plymouth Valiant. Four cars were used in production. One of those cars was an older 1969 model with a 318 V-8 engine that was modified to look like a 1970 model. It had &quot;PLYMOUTH&quot; spelled out across the hood (though the brand name was covered with aluminum foil for the movie), as well as a trunk lid treatment characteristic of the 1970 model. This older modified 1969 car was a stunt car that was used to go down the cliff in the final scene of the film. An actual 1970 model and a 1971 model that both had a 225 Slant Six were also used. The last car was a 1972 model that also had a 225 Slant Six that was used to shoot the additional scenes for theatrical release in April 1972 and was later seen in &quot;Never Give a Trucker an Even Break&quot;, the seventh episode of the Universal television series &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;.

Spielberg did not care what kind of car was used in the film, as long as it was red, which would allow the vehicle to stand out from the landscape in the wide shots of the desert highway.

In what he called an &quot;audition&quot;, Spielberg viewed a number of trucks. He selected the 1957 Peterbilt 281 over the contemporary, flat-nosed, &quot;cab-over&quot; style of trucks. The long hood of the older Peterbilt, its split windshield, and its round headlights give it more of a &quot;face&quot;, adding to its menacing personality. Additionally, Spielberg said that the multiple license plates on the front bumper of the Peterbilt subtly suggest that the truck driver is a serial killer, having &quot;run down other drivers in other states&quot;. For each shot, several people were tasked to make the truck progressively uglier, adding oil, grease, fake dead insects and other blemishes.

The truck was manufactured as a single axle, with a Rockwell TK-570 tag-along axle behind it. It had a 260 HP (194 kW) CAT 1673B turbocharged engine with a single shift RTO-913 13-speed fuller road ranger transmission, making it capable of hauling loads over 30 tons ( t) and reaching top speeds of although the truck was made to appear that it was going faster than it actually was on the big screen. A single truck was used for the original filming, so the shots of it falling off the cliff and being destroyed had to be completed in one take.

A backup truck—a 1960 Peterbilt 281—was built up for the original filming when the Cat Engine in the original 1957 Peterbilt 281 had begun giving the film production problems during rehearsals. On the last day of filming the backup truck was taken off of the film production, leaving them with only one truck at the time to film the final scene of the film. This truck is the only truck from the film known to survive today. This truck is capable of reaching up to a top speed of 64 mph. The 1960 Peterbilt 281 had originally featured a NHBS 262 HP Cummins Engine with a 5 X 3 twin stick transmission at the time filming had taken place, but has since been repowered with a small cam NTC-350 HP Cummins Engine with a 5 X 3 twin stick transmission and has since had a live tandem put underneath the truck. Another truck was purchased to shoot the additional scenes for theatrical release in April 1972; this truck was a 1962 Peterbilt 351 with also a 260 HP (194 kW) CAT 1673B turbocharged engine that was capable of reaching top speeds of 61–65 mph (98–100 km/h) with also a single shift RTO-913 13-speed fuller road ranger transmission that is verified to be long gone today. KW Mudflaps were also visible on this truck at the time of filming.

In 1978, stock footage of both vehicles, along with some new footage of a 1964 Peterbilt 351 truck, was used in &quot;Never Give a Trucker an Even Break&quot;, the seventh episode of the Universal television series &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;. This displeased Spielberg, but Universal owned the &quot;Duel&quot; footage, and could use it as it saw fit.

===Use of sound===
Mann has very little dialogue in the movie, and the truck driver has none. As Spielberg stated in a behind-the-scenes documentary, he instead wanted to let the vehicles and setting &quot;speak&quot; for themselves. The film was shot on a tight schedule, based on a short story, and needed to fit within the 75minutes allotted by ABC; therefore, Spielberg focused on the visuals and menacing audio.

One break from the silences and heavy roar of the vehicles occurs after the initial chase scene, in Chuck&#x27;s Café. Mann uses the restroom to collect himself and recover from his crash, and the audience is introduced to his inner thoughts. This diegetic use of sound was explained by Spielberg as Mann wanting to &quot;physicalize&quot; and &quot;emote&quot; his feelings, thus giving the audience an intimate relationship with Mann.

The use of sound and silence was a technique used by Spielberg to &quot;keep the audience in suspense&quot; throughout the entirety of the film, which he said was inspired by the work of Alfred Hitchcock. According to Spielberg, &quot;sound has to fit like a glove... it makes everything scarier&quot;. As an example, towards the end of the film, Mann is awakened from sleep by noise similar to that of the truck, creating in the audience the expectation of a major turning point in the movie. The sound is revealed to actually be a passing train.

Along with the natural sounds in the film, Spielberg also incorporated a minimal score.

===Music===
The film&#x27;s original score was composed by Billy Goldenberg, who had previously written music for productions directed by Spielberg, including his segment of the &quot;Night Gallery&quot; pilot and the &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Murder by the Book&quot;, as well as scoring &quot;L.A. 2017&quot; with Robert Prince.

Spielberg and &quot;Duel&quot; producer George Eckstein told Goldenberg that because of the short production schedule, he would have to write the music during filming. He visited the production on location at Soledad Canyon to help get an idea of what would be required. Spielberg had Goldenberg ride in the tanker truck driven by stunt driver Loftin on several occasions. The experience terrified the composer at first, but he would eventually get used to it.

Goldenberg composed the score in about a week, for strings, harp, keyboards and heavy use of percussion instruments, with Moog synthesizer effects, but eschewing brass and woodwinds. He then worked with the music editors to &quot;pick from all the pieces [they] had and cut it together&quot; with the sound effects and dialogue. Much of his score ultimately was not used.

In 2015 Intrada Records released a limited edition album featuring the complete score, plus four radio source music tracks composed by Goldenberg.

==Release==
&quot;Duel&quot; was initially shown on American television as an installment of the &quot;ABC Movie of the Week&quot;. It was the 18th highest-rated television movie of the year, with a Nielsen rating of 20.9, and an audience share of 33%.

===Theatrical version===
Following &quot;Duel&quot;″s successful broadcast, Universal decided to release the film theatrically. At 74 minutes, however, it was not long enough for this purpose, so Universal had Spielberg spend two days filming several new scenes to expand it to 90 minutes. A longer opening sequence was added with the car backing out of a garage and driving through Los Angeles, and out into the desert. Additional scenes shot to lengthen the movie included Mann&#x27;s telephone conversation with his wife in the laundromat, the encounter with the broken-down school bus, and the confrontation at the railroad crossing. Some voice over dialogue from the television version was re-written and re-recorded, changing the &quot;tone&quot; of some scenes, and some alternate takes were used as well. Mild expletives were also added to the script, to make the film sound less like a television production.

The full-length film was released in Europe and Australia, and had a limited release in the United States. &quot;Duel&quot;″s success enabled Spielberg to establish himself as a movie director.

===Home video===
The theatrical version of &quot;Duel&quot; has been issued on various formats in the US by MCA and its successor Universal, with many other countries having similar releases. It was released on LaserDisc twice; first on MCA&#x27;s DiscoVision in 1979, and by MCA/Universal Home Video in 1993. It was also released on VHS twice; in 1982 on the MCA Videocassette Inc label, and again in 1990 by MCA/Universal.

&quot;Duel&quot; was first released on DVD by Universal on August 17, 2004, as a full frame collector&#x27;s edition. Before that, Duel was originally scheduled for a widescreen collector&#x27;s edition DVD on May 21, 2002, but was delayed and ultimately unreleased.

The film was released on Blu-ray on October 14, 2014, as part of the eight-film box set &quot;Steven Spielberg Director&#x27;s Collection&quot;. It also had a standalone Blu-ray release on May 5, 2015.

A newly scanned 4K release by Universal, including the original TV version, was released on November 17, 2023.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Duel&quot; received positive reviews and is considered one of the greatest television movies ever made. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Duel&quot; has a score of 89% based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8 out of 10. The site&#x27;s consensus is that &quot;&quot;Duel&quot; makes brilliant use of its simple premise, serving up rock-solid genre thrills while heralding the arrival of a generational talent behind the lens&quot;. In &quot;TV (The Book)&quot;, co-written by television critics Matt Zoller Seitz and Alan Sepinwall, Seitz named &quot;Duel&quot; as the greatest American television movie of all time, writing, &quot;Almost fifty years after its initial broadcast, this stripped-down, subtly mythic action thriller retains a good deal of its power&quot;. A scene made Bravo&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot;.

Reviewing the movie&#x27;s theatrical release in 1983, Janet Maslin wrote that Spielberg &quot;made his mark with a film about a diabolical truck, a subject that would seem to have only limited possibilities. In fact, Mr. Spielberg&#x27;s 1971 television film &quot;Duel&quot; took advantage of the very narrowness of its premise, building excitement from the most minimal ingredients and the simplest of situations. The theatrical version of &quot;Duel&quot; at the Manhattan Twin theater may contain a few extra close-ups of its leading man&#x27;s nose, but otherwise it works as well on the wide screen as it did on the small one. Even without benefit of hindsight, &quot;Duel&quot; looks like the work of an unusually talented young director... The vehicles are the real stars of &quot;Duel,&quot; and whenever the chase is interrupted by the relatively primitive people on hand (at a truck stop and, in one particularly odd sequence, at a gas station run by a woman who keeps pet snakes, spiders and lizards), the film loses its momentum and becomes somewhat clumsy. The ending is abrupt, too, but the main impression left by &quot;Duel&quot; is one of talent and energy. Mr. Spielberg seemed, with this film, to be headed for bigger and better things. Sure enough, he was.&quot;

Leonard Maltin writes that &quot;This TV movie put Spielberg on the map, and rightly so; a superb suspense film.&quot; He rates it as &quot;Above average&quot;, his highest rating for a TV film. David Thomson writes: &quot;The ordinariness of the Dennis Weaver character and the monstrous malignance of the truck confront one another with a narrative assurance that never needs to remind us of the element of fable. The ending is unsatisfactory, partly because the rest of the film is so momentous, but also because sheer skill needed more philosophy for a fitting resolution.&quot; In his overview of the horror genre, &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; (1981), Stephen King writes that &quot;&quot;Duel&quot; is a gripping, almost painfully suspenseful rocket ride of a movie; perhaps not Spielberg&#x27;s best work—that must almost certainly wait for the eighties and nineties—but surely one of the half-dozen best movies ever made for TV.&quot; In an appendix, King lists it as one of the best horror films from 1950 to 1980, with an asterisk denoting it as a personal favorite. King and his son Joe Hill paid homage to &quot;Duel&quot; in their novella &quot;Throttle&quot; (2009).

William Thomas writes: &quot;Tapping into the hidden terrors on the open road, this originally made for TV opus is consummate storytelling in pictures. Like most early efforts, it overflows with a delight in the potential of movies, but matches it with directorial proficiency and unflagging excitement to match... Despite a clever use of sound effects - the truck&#x27;s primal groaning contrasting with Mann&#x27;s whiny engine - &quot;Duel&quot; achieves the frantic energy and striking simplicity of silent film: ironically, considering its small screen origins, it is pure cinema.&quot; Scott Tobias sees the film as a precursor of things to come: &quot;It takes less than a minute of watching &quot;Duel&quot;, Steven Spielberg’s feature-length debut, to realize you’re in the hands of a master director.&quot; Specifically, he sees it as a precursor to &quot;Jaws&quot;: &quot;Now 50 years and countless awards, accolades and box-office dollars later, &quot;Duel&quot; feels like the proto-&quot;Jaws&quot;, an early statement of principles on how to build suspense and terror through patience, simplified action and delayed gratification. If you want to &#x27;play the audience like a violin&#x27;, as Alfred Hitchcock once phrased it to François Truffaut, you can’t be slashing away at the strings all the time. As an exercise – and it is scarcely (if elegantly) more than that – &quot;Duel&quot; is proof positive that a truck menacing a car on the California highway is all the story necessary for a film to exist. Provided it has the right director, of course.&quot;

Interpretations of &quot;Duel&quot; often focus on the symbolism of Mann and the truck. Some critics follow Spielberg&#x27;s own interpretation of the story as an indictment of the mechanization of life, both by literal machines and by social regimentation. The theme of gender performativity in Mann&#x27;s quest to prove his manhood is another interpretation several observers have suggested.

Over the years, &quot;Duel&quot; has developed a strong following and a reputation as a cult film.

==Aftermath==
In 2005, 34 years after the original film, &quot;Duel&quot; was followed by a spinoff sequel, &quot;Throttle&quot;, featuring a scene with Tom Gillen as David Mann (previously portrayed by Dennis Weaver), driving a red Plymouth Valiant that was fixed from the wreckage.

In 2015, a Kickstarter campaign began to finance a documentary about the making of &quot;Duel&quot;. The film would be called &quot;The Devil on Wheels&quot;—a literal translation of the title under which &quot;Duel&quot; was released in Spain—and be directed by Enric Folch.&lt;ref name=&quot;cinemachords/devil-wheels&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The project was said to have the approval of NBC and DreamWorks. The website for &quot;The Devil on Wheels&quot; also collects information about &quot;Duel&quot;. As of February 2023, &quot;The Devil on Wheels&quot; was listed as being in post-production.

<text>Huntingdon is a market town in the Huntingdonshire district of Cambridgeshire, England. The town was given its town charter by King John in 1205. It was the county town of the historic county of Huntingdonshire. Oliver Cromwell was born there in 1599 and became one of its Members of Parliament (MP) in 1628. The former Conservative Prime Minister (1990–1997) John Major served as its MP from 1979 until his retirement in 2001.

==History==
During the Roman Empire, in 274, a massive coin hoard dating to the reign of Tetricus I and Roman Emperor Aurelian was hidden in the grounds of the town. Consisting of 9,724 Roman coins, and discovered in 2018, the Muddy Hoard is considered to date the largest treasure trove of Cambridgeshire.

Huntingdon was founded by the Anglo-Saxons and Danes. It is first mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in 921, where it appears as &quot;Huntandun&quot;. It appears as &quot;Huntedun&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name means &quot;The huntsman&#x27;s hill&quot; or possibly &quot;Hunta&#x27;s hill&quot;.

Huntingdon seems to have been a staging post for Danish raids outside East Anglia until 917, when the Danes moved to Tempsford, now in Bedfordshire, before they were crushed by Edward the Elder. It prospered successively as a bridging point of the River Great Ouse, a market town, and in the 18th and 19th centuries a coaching centre, notably at the &quot;George Hotel&quot;. The town has a well-preserved medieval bridge that used to serve as the main route of Ermine Street over the river. The bridge only ceased to be the sole crossing point to Godmanchester in 1975, with the building of what is now the A1307 (formerly A14) bypass.
The town&#x27;s valuable trading position was secured by Huntingdon Castle, of which only the earthworks of the motte survive. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and home to a beacon used to mark the 400th anniversary of the Spanish Armada.

In 1746, the nurserymen Wood and Ingram of nearby Brampton developed an elm-tree cultivar, &quot;Ulmus × hollandica &#x27;Vegeta&#x27;&quot;, which they named the Huntingdon Elm after the town.

Original documents on Huntingdon&#x27;s history, including the borough charter of 1205, are held by Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies at the County Record Office, Huntingdon.

Parts of Huntingdon, including the centre, were struck by an F1/T3 tornado on 23 November 1981, during a record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day. The centre suffered moderate damage.

Between the railway station and the old hospital building, stands a replica cannon installed in the 1990s to replace one from the Crimean War, scrapped for the war effort in the Second World War. However, it faces in the opposite direction from the original. St Mary&#x27;s Street drill hall was built in the late 19th century.

===George Hotel===
The George Hotel on the corner of High Street and George Street was once a posting house. It was named after Saint George of England in 1574 and bought some 25 years later by Henry Cromwell, grandfather of Oliver Cromwell. Charles I made the George his headquarters in 1645. Later the highwayman Dick Turpin is said to have been a customer when it was a coaching inn on the Great North Road. A theatre was built to the rear of the George in about 1799. The Lincoln company of actors managed by Thomas Shaftoe Robertson and later Fanny Robertson performed here in race weeks. Two wings of the inn burnt down in the mid-19th century, but two were saved, including one with a balcony overlooking the yard. Since 1959, the courtyard and balcony have been used for Shakespeare performances by a company run by the Shakespeare at the George Trust. Until 2024 when the Green King company who run the George Hotel decided it was not in their best interest to continue Shakespeare at the George, ending its 65-year run.

==Government==

Huntingdon has a town council with 19 councillors elected every four years. Two of them serve also as mayor and deputy mayor. Meetings are normally held once a month at Huntingdon Town Hall.

Huntingdonshire District Council has three wards: &quot;Huntingdon North&quot;, &quot;Huntingdon East&quot; and &quot;Huntingdon West&quot;. The three wards each have two councillors. The main offices of Huntingdonshire District Council are in Huntingdon itself.

The third tier of local government is Cambridgeshire County Council providing county-wide services such as roads, education, social services, libraries and heritage protection. Huntingdon is one of 60 electoral divisions, represented by two county councillors.

The fourth tier of local government is Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority, which is headed by a mayor. The Mayor of Cambridgeshire &amp; Peterborough is Dr Nik Johnson.

Huntingdon lies in the parliamentary constituency of the same name (formerly Huntingdonshire). Ben Obese-Jecty MP (Conservative) was elected to this seat in the House of Commons in 2024, replacing Jonathan Djanogly.

==Geography==

Huntingdon incorporates the village of Hartford to the east and the developing areas of Oxmoor, Stukeley Meadows and Hinchingbrooke to the north and west.

Between Godmanchester, Huntingdon and Brampton lies Portholme Meadow, England&#x27;s largest. Its contain many rare species of grass, flowers and dragonfly. It is the only known British habitat of the marsh dandelion. It acts as a natural reservoir for water in times of flood, enabling the river to run off slowly, so helping to preclude flooding in nearby towns. It has also served as a horse racecourse and once was a centre for aviation.

==Culture and community==
The former Literary and Scientific Institute is now Commemoration Hall.
Following the 2013 closure of RAF Brampton, once home to Headquarters RAF Support Command, there are now two operational RAF stations within of the town: RAF Wyton, once a major flying station but now a facility of the Defence Equipment and Support arm of the MOD and RAF Alconbury currently occupied by the United States Air Force.

Part of the medieval infirmary hall of St Johns in the market place became Huntingdon Grammar School. It was attended by Cromwell and by the diarist Samuel Pepys. The building is now the Cromwell Museum, run by Cambridgeshire County Council.

===Legends===
Hinchingbrooke House, once a convent, is said to be haunted. The bridge over the Alconbury Brook named Nun&#x27;s Bridge is said also to be haunted, by one of the nuns who once lived at the convent.

<text>Jacqueline Lichtenberg (born March 25, 1942, Flushing, Queens, New York) is an American science fiction author.

Many of her early novels are set in the Sime~Gen Universe, which she first described in a short story in 1969. Writing the series satisfied her preference for &quot;&#x27;Intimacy&#x27;—the kind of relationship between the character and other characters, between the character and the universe, or between the character and him/herself, that brings trust into life&quot; over &quot;Action,&quot; a genre she &quot;seriously dislike[s].&quot; Her other writings have dealt with fantasy and occult subjects, including articles on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. She has written a monthly review column on science fiction, under the title &quot;Science Fiction&quot;, for &quot;The Monthly Aspectarian&quot;. Under the pen name &#x27;Daniel R. Kerns&#x27;, she has published two novels, &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;Border Dispute&quot;.

Many of her works have been written in collaboration with Jean Lorrah, with whom Lichtenberg has a business partnership. A Star Trek fan, she has been actively involved in the Trekkie fan movement. In particular, she wrote the first Kraith Star Trek fan fiction. She is one of the &quot;Friends of Darkover&quot; and her early writing has been mentored by Marion Zimmer Bradley.

Lichtenberg has a chemistry degree from the University of California, Berkeley.

In an interview that aired on November 5, 2021, Lichtenberg shared that in sixth-grade she could barely read, so when she contracted the measles her mom introduced her to the teenage science-fiction novel &quot;Battle on Mercury&quot; by Lester del Rey. At first Lichtenberg had to use the dictionary to read &quot;Battle on Mercury&quot;, but quickly became an avid science fiction reader. In the 1950s the latest stories were published in science fiction magazines Lichtenberg checked out at the local library, but she was incensed by the poor illustrations that did not match the text in the stories. Lichtenberg inadvertently ended up publishing her first science fiction critique as a letter to the editor of the magazine stating they needed to improve the illustrations, thus setting the stage for her future career as a writer of this genre.

== Sime~Gen Universe ==

Lichtenberg&#x27;s Sime~Gen series involves a distant future where human beings have evolved into two races, with a predator-prey relationship. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Gerald Jonas described Sime~Gen collection as combining &quot;qualities of both porn and the soaps ... because they deal obsessively with the physical union between the two races&quot;. The physical union between Sime and Gen, which is not actually sexual, provides the Sime with a life-giving substance known as &quot;selyn&quot;, produced only within a Gen&#x27;s body.

The Sime~Gen series began with Lichtenberg&#x27;s &quot;Operation High Time&quot;, a short story published in 1969. It followed with her first novel in 1974, &quot;House of Zeor&quot;. As Lichtenberg continued work on the Sime~Gen series in the 1970s, science fiction writers Marion Zimmer Bradley and Hal Clement provided encouragement and mentoring, teaching her more of the &quot;craft and trade of writing&quot;. She also became involved with writing partner Jean Lorrah, who co-authored &quot;First Channel&quot; (1980) with Lichtenberg.

In the 1970s, dedicated fans of this series created the fanzine &quot;A Companion in Zeor&quot;, first published in June 1978 by Karen MacLeod.

<doc id="250592" wikidata="Q1435156" url="?curid=250592" title="Methuen Treaty">
<text>The Methuen Treaty was a military and commercial treaty between England and Portugal that was signed in 1703 as part of the War of the Spanish Succession.

The treaty stipulated that no tax higher than the tax charged for an equal amount of French wines could be charged for Portuguese wines (&quot;but see below&quot;) exported to England, and that English textiles would be admitted to Portugal at all times, regardless of the geopolitical situation in each of the two nations (to ensure England would still accept Portuguese wine in periods when not at war with France).

The Methuen Treaty has been the subject of diverse interpretations. Detractors, including Luís da Cunha, argued that the influx of English woollens led to the decline of the Portuguese wool industry. Additionally, emphasis on wine production, while bringing prosperity to certain regions, left Portugal heavily reliant on England as its primary wine buyer. Critics contended that the focus on wine came at the expense of other agricultural sectors and redirected the nation away from its path towards industrialization.

In defense of the treaty, it&#x27;s been asserted that Portugal lacked the necessary resources for substantial manufacturing endeavors, and its industries were already grappling with stagnation. Furthermore, some believed that the treaty did not confine Portugal&#x27;s trade; instead, it played a pivotal role in augmenting the overall prosperity of the nation through increased commerce and stronger ties with England.

==Background==

At the start of the War of Spanish Succession Portugal was allied with France. As part of this treaty, the French had guaranteed the Portuguese naval protection. In 1702, the English navy sailed close to Lisbon on the way to and from Cadiz, proving to the Portuguese that the French could not keep their promise. They soon began negotiations with the Grand Alliance about switching sides.

There were actually two Methuen Treaties. Both were negotiated for England in Lisbon by John Methuen ( 1650–1706), who served as a member of Parliament, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Privy Counsellor, envoy and then ambassador extraordinary to Portugal. The first, signed in May, was a military alliance that cemented allegiances in the War of Spanish Succession, and was a 4-party treaty negotiated by Karl Ernst, Graf von Waldstein for the emperor, Francisco van Schonenberg (AKA Jacob Abraham Belmonte, c.q. Francesco Belmonte) for the United Provinces, and King Pedro II for Portugal, with Methuen&#x27;s son Sir Paul Methuen (1672–1757) aiding him. The second one, the more well-known trade treaty, was a 2-party treaty signed on 27 December for England by Methuen and for Portugal by Manuel Teles da Silva, 3rd Marquis of Alegrete (1682–1736).

The early years of the War of Spanish Succession, in Flanders, had been rather fruitless. The Tory Party in England was concerned about the cost of the war, and felt that naval warfare was a much cheaper option, with greater potential for success. Portugal offered the advantage of deep-water ports near the Mediterranean which could be used to counter the French Naval base at Toulon.

==Treaty==
There were three major elements to the Methuen Treaties. The first was the establishment of the war aims of the Grand Alliance. Secondly, the agreement meant that Spain would become a new theatre of war. Finally, it regulated the establishment of trade relations, especially between England and Portugal.

Until 1703 the Grand Alliance had never established any formal war aims. The Methuen Treaties changed this as it confirmed that the alliance would try to secure the entire Spanish Empire for Charles of Austria, the Habsburg claimant to the Spanish thrones.

The first treaty also established the numbers of troops the various countries would provide to fight the campaign in Spain. The Portuguese also insisted that Archduke Charles would come to Portugal to lead the forces in order to ensure full allied commitment to the war in Spain.

The second treaty, signed on 27 December 1703 (popularly known as the &quot;Port Wine Treaty&quot;) helped to establish trading relations between England and Portugal. The terms of it allowed English woollen cloth to be admitted into Portugal free of duty; in return, Portuguese wines imported into England would be subject to a third less duty than wines imported from France. This was particularly important in helping the development of the port industry. As England was at war with France, it became increasingly difficult to acquire wine, and so port started to become a popular replacement.

==Ireland 1780s==
The Kingdom of Ireland imported Portuguese wine at the low Methuen tariffs, but was banned under the Navigation Acts from exporting. In 1779, Ireland was granted &quot;free trade&quot;, but Portugal imposed higher tariffs on Irish textile imports than on English ones, arguing it was outside the terms of the Methuen treaty. This was a tactic in Portugal&#x27;s broader attempt to make Britain renegotiate the Methuen treaty. As the dispute dragged on, Ireland imposed higher tariffs on Portuguese goods, and the Irish Volunteers&#x27; 1782 Dungannon resolutions included calls for a boycott of its wines. The 1786 Eden Agreement between Britain and France caused Portugal to relent in 1787 and allow Ireland low tariffs.

<text>In the Baháʼí Faith, the Qiblih (, &quot;direction&quot;) is the location to which Baháʼís face when saying their daily obligatory prayers. The Qiblih is fixed at the Shrine of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, near Acre, in present-day Israel; approximately at .

In Bábism the Qiblih was originally identified by the Báb with &quot;the One Whom God will make manifest&quot;, a messianic figure predicted by the Báb. Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, the Prophet-founder of the Baháʼí Faith claimed to be the figure predicted by the Báb. In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh confirms the Báb&#x27;s ordinance and further ordains his final resting-place as the Qiblih for his followers. ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá describes that spot as the &quot;luminous Shrine&quot;, &quot;the place around which circumambulate the Concourse on High&quot;. The concept exists in other religions. Jews face Jerusalem, more specifically the site of the former Temple of Jerusalem. Muslims face the Kaaba in Mecca, which they also call the &quot;Qibla&quot; (another transliteration of Qiblih).

Baháʼís do not worship the Shrine of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh or its contents, the Qiblih is simply a focal point for the obligatory prayers. When praying obligatory prayers the members of the Baháʼí Faith face in the direction of the Qiblih. It is a fixed requirement for the recitation of an obligatory prayer, but for other prayers and devotions one may follow what is written in the Qurʼan: &quot;Whichever way ye turn, there is the face of God.&quot;

==Burial of the dead==
&quot;The dead should be buried with their face turned towards the Qiblih. This also is in accordance with what is practiced in Islam. There is also a congregational prayer to be recited. Besides this there is no other ceremony to be performed&quot; (From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, July 6, 1935).

<text>Allumwandlung (, German for &quot;complete promotion&quot;, sometimes abbreviated AUW) is a chess problem theme where, at some stage in the solution, a pawn (or sometimes pawns) is promoted variously to a queen, rook, bishop, and knight. Allumwandlung&#x27;s main requirement is promotion, either a white pawn or a black pawn. A Babson task may appear if both pawns are spotted in an individual problem, corresponding one another.
==Examples==

The diagram shows a chess problem with Allumwandlung composed by Niels Høeg and first published in 1905. White to move and &quot;mate in three&quot;. The key move (White&#x27;s first move) is 1.f7, and depending on how Black defends, White promotes to either a queen, a rook, a bishop or a knight on move two. The lines are:
* 1... e4 2. f8=Q any 3. Qe7/Qf6#
* 1... Kd6 2. f8=Q+ Kc6 3. Qc5#
* 1... exf4 2. f8=R Kd6 3. Rf6#
* 1... exd4 2. f8=B Kf6 3. Ra6#
* 1... Kf6 2. f8=N exd4 3. Rf7#

The importance of White&#x27;s underpromotions can be understood by considering what happens if White promotes incorrectly:

* After 1...exf4 or 1...exd4 2.f8=Q?? is stalemate, as black no longer has a legal move to play. 
* After 1... exf4, 2. f8=B?? is stalemate.
* Any other promotions will not allow mate on the third move. For example, 1... Kf6 2. f8=Q+ Kxg6: there is no knight to defend the g6 pawn. Or, 1... Kd6 2. f8=R Kc6 and there is an escape on b5.

Another example is at right. Here, four different pawns are promoted to the four possible pieces. 1...d1=Q threatens checks on d5, g1 and g4. White&#x27;s only defence is 2. e8=N+. Black can continue the pressure with 2...Kg6. Now, Qd5+ is still a threat, but 3. a8=Q?? Qd5+ 4. Qxd5 is stalemate. Instead, White defends with 3. a8=B! There are no checks available, so Black plays 3...Qd3 and now 4. c8=Q?? Qd5+ 4. Bxd5 is also stalemate. White plays 4. c8=R and has a decisive lead (Stockfish evaluation +6.7).

<text>Coverdale–Page (stylised as Coverdale • Page) is a collaborative studio album by English singer David Coverdale and guitarist Jimmy Page. It was released on 15 March 1993 by EMI in Europe, 16 March by Geffen Records in North America and 18 March by Sony Music Entertainment in Japan. The album&#x27;s production was handled by Coverdale, Page and Mike Fraser. Following the disbandment of Coverdale&#x27;s band Whitesnake and a failed reunion attempt by Page&#x27;s band Led Zeppelin, John Kalodner proposed the idea to Page of the musicians working together. After meeting each other, they began writing songs, which were then recorded over the course of 1991 and 1992.

Critical reception towards &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; was generally mixed; some music critics praised Coverdale and Page&#x27;s partnership as a successful blend of both their respective bands. However, others viewed the collaboration as a second-rate Led Zeppelin, with many drawing unfavourable comparisons between Coverdale and Robert Plant. The album charted in 12 countries, including reaching number four in the UK and number five in the US. It was certified platinum in the US and Canada, respectively. Following a short Japanese tour in December 1993, Coverdale and Page parted ways. A reissue is in the works, while Coverdale and Page have also discussed a potential reunion.

== Background ==
After completing the Liquor &amp; Poker World Tour in September 1990, vocalist David Coverdale decided to put his band Whitesnake on indefinite hold, wanting to take a break from the music industry. Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, meanwhile, had been working on the &quot;Led Zeppelin Remasters&quot;, which led to discussion with singer Robert Plant and bassist John Paul Jones about a potential reunion. Though initially interested, Plant decided to back out, feeling that a reunion might &quot;put his solo career at risk&quot;. Wanting to work on new music, Page then began looking for a new collaborator. As both he and Coverdale were signed to Geffen Records, A&amp;R executive John Kalodner suggested them working together. The idea was submitted to Coverdale and Page in January 1991. While the two had met many times in passing, they did not know each other well. Still, both parties were interested, thus a meeting was scheduled.

Coverdale and Page met at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York at the end of March 1991. The two got along well with one another and while on a walk in Manhattan, they apparently stopped traffic with onlookers asking if a collaboration was in the works. Coverdale and Page agreed to take the project slowly, first making sure they could actually write songs together. The two then met up for a writing session at Lake Tahoe, Coverdale&#x27;s residence. Within the first day they had written their first song together. From there, Coverdale and Page continued writing, eventually relocating to Barbados at Page&#x27;s suggestion. The two were later joined by drummer Denny Carmassi and bassist Ricky Phillips to flesh out the songs; these rehearsals lasted for several months. Coverdale and Page made their first public appearance together in May 1991, when they joined Poison onstage in Reno for a rendition of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; (1971).

== Production and composition ==
Recording for &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; began at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, where all the rhythm tracks were recorded. From there, recording was moved to Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, where the vocals and overdubs were done. Coverdale and Page also employed several local session musicians while in Miami. Additional recording was also done at Abbey Road Studios in London, and Highbrow Productions, Coverdale&#x27;s home studio in Nevada. The recording process for the album, lasted from late 1991 to early 1992. Work was momentarily put on hold after Coverdale&#x27;s mother fell ill and ultimately passed away. According to Phillips, however, it took Page approximately a year to record his guitar parts. The album was recorded using analog equipment as opposed to digital, as Coverdale and Page felt analog suited their style of music better. Initially, Coverdale and Page were set to be credited as the sole producers, but they eventually decided to give recording and mixing engineer Mike Fraser a co-production credit for his extensive work on &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot;. Mastering was handled by George Marino at Sterling Sound, while the cover art was designed by Hugh Syme. Aside from Coverdale and Page, the album features performances from Carmassi, Phillips, keyboardist Lester Mendez and backing vocalist Johnne Sambataro, among others.

=== Music and lyrics ===
Coverdale and Page&#x27;s music has generally been referred to by music publications and critics as blues rock and hard rock.
The opening riff of &quot;Shake My Tree&quot; dates back to Led Zeppelin&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot;. Page had played the riff during rehearsals, but it was left unused. He later presented the riff to Paul Rodgers while in the Firm, but it was again rejected. When Page presented the riff to Coverdale, he &quot;immediately latched on to it&quot;. On &quot;Waiting on You&quot;, Coverdale initially struggled coming up with a vocal melody for the pre-chorus. Eventually, he came up with a line reminiscent of Motown. As a precaution, Page had also written a vocal melody for the part, but upon hearing Coverdale&#x27;s idea, he forwent his own. The verse-chorus chord progression for &quot;Take Me for a Little While&quot; was written by Page at Lake Tahoe. Lyrically, Coverdale described the song as a &quot;reflective piece&quot;, inspired by personal tragedies both he and Page had gone though in their lives. In 2020, Page stated in an Instagram post that the orchestrations on &quot;Take Me for a Little While&quot; were done by Clare Fischer, despite his lack of credit in the liner notes.

The opening riff of &quot;Pride and Joy&quot; was written by Coverdale, which he presented to Page in Barbados. This led to the song&#x27;s original working title of &quot;Barbados Boogie&quot;. &quot;Pride and Joy&quot; also marked the first time Page had performed harmonica on a recording since 1965&#x27;s &quot;She Just Satisfies&quot;. He also plays a dulcimer, which he had previously done on &quot;That&#x27;s the Way&quot; from &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; (1970). &quot;Over Now&quot; developed from another Page chord progression, which Coverdale described as sounding &quot;dark&quot; and &quot;malevolent&quot;. The song&#x27;s lyrics were inspired by Coverdale&#x27;s divorce from Tawny Kitaen. &quot;Feeling Hot&quot; was described by Page as &quot;one of those real fun rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll numbers&quot;. It was the second song Page and Coverdale wrote together, being partly inspired by 1940s swing music. The lyrics to &quot;Easy Does It&quot; deal with celebrity life and its effect on a relationship. The chord progression for &quot;Take a Look at Yourself&quot; was written by Page at Lake Tahoe. The song was later finished in Barbados, when another section written by Coverdale was added and the tempo was changed. &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot; was singled out by Coverdale as a particular favourite from the album. The introductory riff had been written by Coverdale many years earlier, but left unused until he presented it to Page. &quot;Absolution Blues&quot; was the first song Coverdale and Page wrote together, while the lyrics to &quot;Whisper a Prayer for the Dying&quot; deal with the Gulf War.

Additional songs were recorded, but left unused, which led Coverdale to suggest doing a double album or a second album. At least four songs remain officially unreleased from the &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; sessions, including one titled &quot;Saccharine&quot; and an alternative mix of &quot;Shake My Tree&quot;. Some of Coverdale&#x27;s unused ideas were later reappropriated for Whitesnake&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;Restless Heart&quot; (&quot;Woman Trouble Blues&quot; and &quot;Take Me Back Again&quot;) and 2019&#x27;s &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot; (&quot;Gonna Be Alright&quot;), as well as his 2000 solo album &quot;Into The Light&quot; (&quot;River Song&quot;).

== Release and promotion ==
Before settling on &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot;, working titles for the record included &quot;Legends&quot; and &quot;North and South&quot;. The album was released on 15 March 1993 in Europe by EMI, 16 March in North America by Geffen and 18 March in Japan by Sony. &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; debuted at number four on the UK Albums Chart, and by April 1993, it had been certified silver by the BPI for sales of over 60,000 copies in the UK. In the US, the album reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified gold by the RIAA in June for sales of 500,000 units in the country, before eventually being certified platinum in 1995. &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; also cracked the top 10 in Finland, Canada, Japan and Sweden. It was certified gold in Japan and platinum in Canada. Overall, the album charted in 12 countries.

Five singles were released, all of which charted. The highest-charting singles were &quot;Pride and Joy&quot; and &quot;Shake My Tree&quot;, which reached numbers one and three, respectively, on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart. Music videos were produced for &quot;Pride and Joy&quot; and &quot;Take Me for a Little While&quot;, both directed by Andy Morahan. While &quot;Pride and Joy&quot; reportedly did well on MTV (also being featured on an episode of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;), &quot;Take Me for a Little While&quot; received minimal airplay according to Coverdale, as the video was apparently deemed too gothic by the channel.

==Touring==

In April 1993, auditions for Coverdale and Page&#x27;s touring band were held in London. Carmassi was retained from the recording sessions, while bassist Guy Pratt and keyboardist Brett Tuggle were brought on board as new members. A North American and European tour was planned, but eventually cancelled. Due to the popularity of grunge, promoters were allegedly &quot;skeptical of [Coverdale and Page&#x27;s] pulling power in a poor market for traditional heavy rock&quot;. Thus, a &quot;financially viable&quot; tour was not possible. This was seconded by Pratt, who stated: &quot;It was originally meant to be an American and European tour, but it was booked as arenas and the ticket sales just weren&#x27;t there.&quot; Conversely, Coverdale stated: &quot;The whole arrangement for the &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; project was to go directly to the theatres, to the stage, and nothing, not even a whisper, came from Jimmy&#x27;s manager when the album was released.&quot; Coverdale blamed Page&#x27;s manager for the lack of touring, who was allegedly unenthusiastic about the project and wouldn&#x27;t commit to live dates. Pratt, meanwhile, stated that Page was content with performing in theaters, while Coverdale considered it &quot;downsizing&quot;.

Japanese dates for December 1993 were still tentatively booked, and according to Coverdale, it wasn&#x27;t until he brought the matter directly to Page that the latter agreed to do the shows. There were scheduled seven concerts, beginning on 14–15 December at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, continued at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium, Osaka-jō Hall and ending on 22 December at the Aichi Prefectural Gymnasium in Nagoya. Aside from &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; material, the seven shows also featured several songs by Whitesnake (&quot;Slide It In&quot;, &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;, &quot;Still of the Night&quot;) and Led Zeppelin (&quot;Rock and Roll&quot;, &quot;Kashmir&quot;, &quot;In My Time of Dying&quot;, &quot;White Summer&quot;, &quot;Black Mountain Side&quot;, &quot;The Ocean&quot;, &quot;Black Dog&quot;, &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;).

While Coverdale often toured in Japan, these concerts marked the first time Page had played in the country since Led Zeppelin&#x27;s 1972 Japanese Tour. Despite the lack of any further touring, both Coverdale and Page intended to continue working together. However, according to Coverdale, Page&#x27;s manager &quot;insisted we call it a day&quot;, thus their work together came to an abrupt end. While rehearsing for the Japanese dates, Page was contacted by Plant&#x27;s management about performing with him on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. This eventually came to fruition with the &quot;Unledded&quot; project in 1994. In 1995, Page and Plant performed &quot;Shake My Tree&quot; from the &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; album.

== Reception ==
&quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; was met with mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s J. D. Considine stated: &quot;&quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; may not be the second coming of Led Zeppelin, but it&#x27;s close enough that only the most curmudgeonly would deny the band its due.&quot; He gave kudos to Page&#x27;s guitar playing and Coverdale&#x27;s vocals, feeling the voice had &quot;never been put to better use&quot; than against the guitar. Dave Lewis, writing for &quot;Record Collector&quot;, touted the record as Page&#x27;s best work since the break up of Led Zeppelin, while Jörg Staude of &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; commended Coverdale for what he perceived as an improved performance compared to the previous two Whitesnake albums. Katharine Truman, for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, noted that while &quot;not as bombastic as Whitesnake nor as excitingly diverse as Zeppelin, &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; is nonetheless a rock-solid effort&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s staff declared the album &quot;excellent&quot; and wrote that it &quot;screams classic from start to finish&quot;, while the staff of &quot;Rock Hard&quot; called the record &quot;a successful symbiosis&quot; of Coverdale and Page&#x27;s past works.

Critic Robert Christgau rated &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; a &quot;Dud&quot;, which his website describes as a &quot;bad record whose details rarely merit further thought&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s David Browne characterised the album as an &quot;incredible, if pointless&quot; Led Zeppelin imitation. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Greg Kot also called the album &quot;pointless&quot; and a &quot;Led Zeppelin rehash beneath Page and beyond singer David Coverdale&quot;. Several outlets were highly critical of Coverdale, whose performance many considered a poor imitation of Plant. Tom Moon, for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, described Coverdale as a &quot;raspy, bad-boy Robert Plant wannabe&quot;, who &quot;lacks a shred individuality&quot;. Robert Philpot of the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; felt that &quot;sometimes [Coverdale&#x27;s] screams eerily recall Plant&quot;, while other times he ends up sounding hoarse. Philpot described the record as &quot;either a Whitesnake album with a really good guitar player, or a Led Zeppelin album with a really heavy-handed vocalist&quot;. L. Kent Wolgamott of the &quot;Lincoln Journal Star&quot; felt similarly, stating that the record &quot;sounds like a good album from Whitesnake&quot;, but &quot;Led Zeppelin it certainly is not&quot;.

Retrospective reviews have leaned slightly more positive. Music journalist Mick Wall declared &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; &quot;one of the best albums of both [Coverdale and Page&#x27;s] respective careers&quot;, while AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine concluded his review by stating: &quot;&quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; boils down to a guilty pleasure at its best moments, but never quite rivals the bold experimentation of Led Zeppelin.&quot; Neil Jeffries, in a piece for &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, ranked &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; thirteenth in Coverdale&#x27;s overall studio discography, concluding that the singer sounds &quot;unsure whether to impersonate Robert Plant or be himself&quot;. He also noted that while the album sold well, &quot;the partnership didn&#x27;t last and we should probably be grateful for that&quot;. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; included &quot;Pride and Joy&quot; on their list of Coverdale&#x27;s top 10 songs. They also ranked it, along with &quot;Easy Does It&quot;, among their top 10 Page songs released after his work with Led Zeppelin.

===Robert Plant&#x27;s commentary===
The collaboration between Coverdale and Page also drew some negative comments from Plant. While Plant commented positively on Page&#x27;s playing, he was critical of the pairing, stating: &quot;I found it difficult to understand [Page&#x27;s] choice of bedfellow. I just could not get it.&quot; Even before collaborating with Page, Coverdale had been accused of copying Plant, who had reportedly referred to him in interviews as &quot;David Cover-version&quot;, among other taunts. Page called Plant&#x27;s negative comments as &quot;short-sighted [...] because David&#x27;s employing so many different colours and textures to his voice&quot;, while Coverdale described them as a &quot;stab in the back&quot;, having considered Plant a friend in the past whom respected as an artist. Regarding the negative comparisons to Led Zeppelin and Whitesnake, Coverdale stated: &quot;Comparisons are inevitable. You have David Coverdale and Jimmy Page working together, then there are bound to be similarities to former works, because that&#x27;s who we are&quot;. He also did not find their past works relevant to the collaboration, which he felt was born out of their mutual talents as musicians.

== Legacy ==
Despite their project&#x27;s short lifespan, both Coverdale and Page have reflected positively on the experience. In a 1993 interview with Robert Hilburn, Page commented that in comparison to his work in the 1980s, &quot;working with David was a totally different thing. It was suddenly right back to that original spark of creativity and ideas flowing. I feel I have my heart in it again&quot;. Assessing the collaboration in retrospect, he stated: &quot;There was no [bullshit] in any respect or in how we executed. I wanted to show that I was still alive and kicking, and in that regard it was a total success.&quot; In 2004, Page noted: &quot;David was really good to work with. It was very short-lived, but I enjoyed working with him, believe it or not.&quot; Coverdale later commented in 2011: &quot;If I got a call from [Page], asking if I&#x27;d work with him on a solo album or anything, I&#x27;d be there in a heartbeat.&quot; VH1&#x27;s Greg Prato put forth the idea that the whole Coverdale–Page project was just a way for Page to spite Plant, who had been reluctant to reunite Led Zeppelin. Page denied this outright, calling the entire notion &quot;pathetic&quot;.

In 2021, Coverdale revealed plans for a tentative reissue in 2023 to celebrate the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Having procured the rights to the record from Universal, Coverdale told SiriusXM&#x27;s Eddie Trunk that the reissue will potentially feature remastered and remixed versions of &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot;, four unreleased tracks, live material, as well as other bonus content. He also stated that he and Page had discussed the possibility of writing and recording together again, though their plans were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 22 November 2023, the album was reissued in Japan on analog vinyl for the first time.

<text>Clovis II (633 – 657) was King of the Franks in Neustria and Burgundy, having succeeded his father Dagobert I in 639. His brother Sigebert III had been King of Austrasia since 634. He was initially under the regency of his mother Nanthild until her death in her early thirties in 642. Nanthild&#x27;s death allowed Clovis to fall under the influence of the secular magnates, who reduced the royal power in their own favour; first Aega and then Erchinoald. The Burgundian mayor of the palace Flaochad used him to lure his rival, Willebad, to a battle in Autun, in which Willebad was killed.

==Background==
Clovis married Balthild, an Anglo-Saxon sold into slavery in Gaul. She had been owned by the Neustrian mayor of the palace, Erchinoald, but then attracted the interest of the king. They had three sons, who all became kings after his death. The eldest, Chlothar, succeeded him and his second eldest, Childeric, was placed on the Austrasian throne and eventually also succeeded in Neustria. The youngest, Theuderic, succeeded Childeric in Neustria and eventually became the sole king of the Franks.

Clovis was a minor for almost the whole of his reign. He is sometimes regarded as king of Austrasia during the interval 656–57 when Childebert the Adopted usurped the throne. Grimoald the Elder, mayor of the palace of Austrasia, was captured and later executed in Paris by Clovis II, the king of Neustria, in 657. He is often regarded as an early &quot;roi fainéant&quot;. Belgian historian Henri Pirenne stated that Clovis &quot;died insane.&quot;

Clovis II was buried in Saint Denis Basilica, Paris.

<doc id="250619" wikidata="Q237750" url="?curid=250619" title="Balthild of Chelles">
<text>Balthild ( 626 – 30 January 680) (; , &#x27;bold sword&#x27; or &#x27;bold spear), also spelled Bathilda, Bauthieult or Baudour, was queen consort of Neustria and Burgundy by marriage to Clovis II, the King of Neustria and Burgundy (639–658), and regent during the minority of her son, Chlothar III. Her hagiography was intended to further her successful candidature for sainthood.

Tradition represents her as an Anglo-Saxon who was originally of noble birth, perhaps a relative of Ricberht of East Anglia, the last pagan king of East Anglia, although Pierre Fournet regards this as doubtful. Ricberht was ousted by Sigeberht, who had spent time as an exile in the Frankish court, during which he had converted to Christianity. Sigeberht was established as the rightful heir to the throne with Frankish help.

==Hagiographic tradition==

According to &quot;Vita S. Bathildis&quot;, Balthild was born circa 626–627. She was beautiful, intelligent, modest and attentive to the needs of others. Balthild was sold into slavery as a young girl and served in the household of Erchinoald, the mayor of the palace of Neustria to Clovis. Erchinoald, whose wife had died, was attracted to Balthild and wanted to marry her, but she did not want to marry him. She hid herself away and waited until Erchinoald had remarried. Later, possibly because of Erchinoald, Clovis noticed her and asked for her hand in marriage.

Even as queen, Balthild remained humble and modest. She is famous for her charitable service and generous donations. From her donations, the abbeys of Corbie and Chelles were founded; it is likely that others such as Jumièges, Jouarre and Luxeuil were also founded by the queen. She provided support for Claudius of Besançon and his abbey in the Jura Mountains.

Balthild bore Clovis three children, all of whom became kings: Clotaire, Childeric and Theuderic.

When Clovis died (between 655 and 658), his eldest son Clotaire succeeded to the throne. His mother Balthild acted as the queen regent. As queen, she was a capable stateswoman. She abolished the practice of trading Christian slaves and strove to free children who had been sold into slavery. Balthild and Eligius, according to Dado, &quot;worked together on their favourite charity, the buying and freeing of slaves&quot;. After a power struggle with mayor Ebroin, Balthild withdrew to her favourite Abbey of Chelles near Paris.

Balthild died on 30 January 680 and was buried at the Abbey of Chelles, east of Paris. Her &quot;Vita&quot; was written soon after her death, probably by one of the community of Chelles. The &quot;Vita Baldechildis/Vita Bathildis reginae Francorum&quot; in &quot;Monumenta Germania Historica, Scriptores Rerum Merovincarum&quot;, as with most of the &quot;vitae&quot; of royal Merovingian-era saints, provides some useful details for the historian. Her official cult began when her remains were transferred from the former abbey to a new church, in 833, under the auspices of Louis the Pious. Balthild was canonised by Pope Nicholas I, around 200 years after her death.

==Other sources==

&quot;Sainted Women of the Dark Ages&quot; states that Balthild &quot;was not the first Merovingian queen to begin her career in servitude&quot;. Other Merovingian queens who arose from servile status include Fredegund, the mother of Clothaire II; Bilichild, the wife of Theudebert of Austrasia; and possibly Nanthild, the mother of Clovis II. However, research has shown that the slavery of Balthild was probably an invention and that she in fact belonged to an upper-class Anglo-Saxon family.

During the minority of Clotaire III, she had to deal with the attempted coup of Grimoald, the major domus of Austrasia, but she enjoyed the continued support of her former master Erchinoald, who became a sort of &#x27;political mentor&#x27; to her throughout her marriage to Clovis II.

According to some historians, Balthild&#x27;s creation of and involvement with monasteries was perhaps an act to &quot;balance or even neutralize the efforts of the aristocratic opposition&quot;. By installing her supporters as bishops of different sees, she gained even greater power as a ruler.

According to the &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; by Stephen of Ripon, Bathild was a ruthless ruler, in conflict with the bishops and perhaps responsible for several assassinations. However, the bishop she so famously murdered, Dalfinus, is not listed as a bishop of Lyon. The story may have been written to embellish the life of Wilfrid.

A fragment of an apron thought to have belonged to Balthild is taken by scholars as evidence for her piety and frugality. Her devotion to her faith and forsaking of luxury is evident from a cross embroidered on the apron in silk, rather than gold thread.
==Balthild seal matrix==
A gold seal matrix, which was originally attached to a seal-ring, was uncovered in 1999 by a metal detector in a field in Postwick, east of Norwich, in Norfolk. One side shows a woman&#x27;s face and her name &quot;BALDAHILDIS&quot; in Frankish lettering. The other side portrays two naked figures, a man and a woman, embracing one another beneath a cross.

In Merovingian Gaul, one side of the seal was intended to be used with official documents. The other side would have been used only for private papers. It is uncertain why the seal matrix came to East Anglia. It may have been a gift, or a representative of Balthild may have worn it as a form of identification. It has also been suggested that the seal matrix was returned to Balthild&#x27;s kin after she died. Paul Fouracre of the University of Manchester speculated that the seal may belong to a different Baldahildis entirely. The seal matrix is in the keeping of the Norwich Castle Museum.

==Chemise of Balthild==
Balthild&#x27;s ornate chemise both expresses her dedication to the church, as well as her status as a queen to Clovis II. The sleeveless tabard was likely crafted by either Balthid herself, or nuns of Chelles Abbey, and measures wide and tall. It intended to loosely hang over the front and back of the body over a dress, although the back portion is currently lost. The garment consists of simple linen as a gesture of humility towards the church, as linen was a fabric commonly worn by lower classes of the time. The silken details make up a large bejewelled Christian cross tall, small human and bird portraits, as well as several patterned rings around the collar mimicking studded golden necklaces. These embroidered necklaces were sewn in the exact likeness of the jewellery Balthild wore during her status as queen, and were also a symbol of Balthild&#x27;s devotion, trading her actual jewellery for sewn replica as a member of Chelles Abbey.

There are conflicting claims on this history of this garment, centred on whether it was ever worn by Balthild herself in life, in death, or at all. The common argument is that it was a burial shirt that followed Balthild into her tomb. This is challenged by claims that the shirt was worn frequently by Balthild during her life in service at Chelles but not during her death. These arguments have surfaced due to the dubious history of the dress and Balthild&#x27;s body, which have been disturbed multiple times muddying attempts at accurate documentation. Balthild&#x27;s body and dress have been relocated two documented times. The first time they were moved, they were moved behind the Chelles Abbey altar as relics in 833, likely in hopes of attracting Christians on pilgrimages. The dress was said to be found once again hidden inside a sixteenth-century reliquary in attempts of saving it from destruction during the French Revolution.

<doc id="250620" wikidata="Q882494" url="?curid=250620" title="Edward J. Thye">
<text>Edward John Thye (April 26, 1896August 28, 1969) was an American politician. A member of the Republican Party, he was the 26th governor of Minnesota from 1943 to 1947 and a United States Senator from 1947 to 1959.

==Early life and education==
Edward Thye was born on a farm near Frederick, South Dakota. One of nine children, he was the son of Andrew John and Bertha (née Wangan) Thye. His father, a farmer, was born in Norway and immigrated to the United States in 1872. His brother Ted Thye became a professional wrestler in the Pacific Northwest.

In 1904, Thye and his family moved to Northfield, Minnesota, where he attended local public schools. He took courses at the Tractor and Internal Combustion School in Minneapolis in 1913, and graduated from the American Business College in 1916. After the United States entered World War I, he enlisted as a private in the United States Army Air Corps in 1917. He served overseas in France, and was eventually promoted to second lieutenant.

==Early career==
After his military service, Thye returned to Minnesota in 1919 and was employed as a tractor expert with the Deere &amp; Webber Company in Minneapolis, becoming a salesman in 1920. He married Hazel Ramage (daughter of Robert and Bertha (Frink) Ramage) in 1921, and the couple remained married until her death in 1936; they had one daughter, Jean Roberta. He continued to work for Deere until 1922, when he became manager and owner of a dairy farm near Northfield.

In 1925, Thye was elected to the town council of Sciota. He later served a number of years on the Sciota school board. He was president of the Dakota County Farm Bureau (1929–1931), director of Twin City Milk Producers Association (1933), and appraiser for the Federal Land Bank of Minnesota (1933–1934). He became friends with Harold Stassen, and actively supported Stassen&#x27;s campaign for governor of Minnesota in 1938. He subsequently served as the Dairy and Food Commissioner of Minnesota and deputy commissioner of agriculture (1939–1942).

==Governor of Minnesota==
Thye was elected the 31st lieutenant governor of Minnesota in November 1942. The same month, he was remarried to Myrtle Ennor Oliver; the couple remained married until his death. On April 27, 1943, Stassen resigned to serve in the United States Navy and Thye succeeded him as the 26th governor of Minnesota. He was elected governor in November 1944 by the largest margin ever for a Minnesota gubernatorial candidate.

In the 1944 presidential election, Thye joined U.S. Senator Henrik Shipstead, an isolationist, in supporting Republican nominee Thomas E. Dewey, the governor of New York. Minnesota&#x27;s other senator at the time, Joseph H. Ball, refused to support Dewey and crossed party lines to back Franklin D. Roosevelt, who won Minnesota&#x27;s 11 electoral votes.

During his state administration, Thye established the Department of Aeronautics, the Iron Range Rehabilitation Commission, a postwar planning commission, and a human rights commission. He also increased spending for highway construction and unemployment compensation.

==U.S. Senate==
Thye was elected as a United States Senator in 1946, defeating Henrik Shipstead in the Republican primary and the Democratic-Farmer-Labor nominee Theodore Jorgenson with 58.9% of the vote. He was re-elected in 1952 with 56.63% of the vote. He served in the Senate from January 3, 1947, to January 3, 1959, in the 80th, 81st, 82nd, 83rd, 84th, and 85th Congresses. Thye voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1957. He lost his 1958 reelection bid to Eugene McCarthy.

==Death==
Thye died on August 28, 1969, in Northfield, Minnesota, aged 73. He was buried at the Oaklawn Cemetery in Northfield.

==Papers==

Thye&#x27;s papers, including correspondence, speeches, background materials, bills and reports, clippings, campaign literature, and related materials reflecting Thye&#x27;s public and official activities as U.S. senator from Minnesota, are available for research use.

<text>Eustache Deschamps (13461406 or 1407) was a French poet, byname Morel, in French &quot;Nightshade&quot;.

==Life and career==
Deschamps was born in Vertus. He received lessons in versification from Guillaume de Machaut and later studied law at Orleans University. He then traveled through Europe as a diplomatic messenger for Charles V, being sent on missions to Bohemia, Hungary and Moravia. In 1372 he was made &quot;huissier d&#x27;armes&quot; to Charles. He received many other important offices, was &quot;bailli&quot; of Valois, and afterwards of Senlis, squire to the Dauphin, and governor of Fismes.

In 1380, Charles died, and Deschamps&#x27;s estate was pillaged by the English, after which he often used the name &quot;Brulé des Champs&quot;. In his childhood he had been an eyewitness of the English invasion of 1358, he had been present at the siege of Reims in 1360 and seen the march on Chartres, and he had witnessed the signing of the Treaty of Brétigny. In consequence he hated the English and continuously abused them in his many poems.

==Works==
Deschamps wrote as many as 1,175 ballades, and he is sometimes credited with inventing the form. All but one of his poems are short, and they are mostly satirical, attacking the English, whom he regards as the plunderers of his country, and against the wealthy oppressors of the poor. His satires were also directed at corrupt officials and clergy but his sharp wit may have cost him his job as Bailli of Senlis.

He was the author of a treatise on French verse entitled &quot;L&#x27;Art de dictier et de fere chansons, balades, virelais et rondeaulx&quot;, completed on 25 November 1392. Besides giving rules for the composition of the kinds of verse mentioned in the title he enunciates some theories on poetry. He divides music into music proper and poetry. Music proper he calls artificial on the ground that everyone could by dint of study become a musician; poetry he calls natural because he says it is not an art that can be acquired but a gift. He stresses the harmony of verse, because, as was the fashion of his day, he practically took it for granted that all poetry was to be sung.

His one long poetic work, &quot;Le Miroir de Mariage&quot;, is a 12,103-line satirical poem on the subject of women. This work influenced Geoffrey Chaucer who used themes from the poem in his own work. Chaucer seems to be one of the few Englishmen Deschamps liked, as he composed a ballade in his honour (n. 285, probably written sometime after 1380) praising Chaucer as a great philosopher, translator, ethicist, and poet.

He also wrote about the decline in morals of his time, and also of the worsening state of affairs during the late middle ages, mentioning war, famine and disease.

Deschamps wrote two texts upon his teacher Machaut&#x27;s death in 1377. They were combined and set to music into &quot;Armes, amours/O flour des flours&quot; (&quot;Weapons, loves/O flower of flowers&quot;), a double ballade for four voices by F. Andrieu.

Deschamps translated Vitalis of Blois&#x27;s &quot;Geta&quot;, a 12th-century Latin elegiac comedy, into French.

<doc id="250626" wikidata="Q1356368" url="?curid=250626" title="John Hopkinson">
<text>John Hopkinson, FRS, (27 July 1849 – 27 August 1898) was a British physicist, electrical engineer, Fellow of the Royal Society and President of the IEE (now the IET) twice in 1890 and 1896. He invented the three-wire (three-phase) system for the distribution of electrical power, for which he was granted a patent in 1882. He also worked in many areas of electromagnetism and electrostatics, and in 1890 was appointed professor of electrical engineering at King&#x27;s College London, where he was also director of the Siemens Laboratory.
Hopkinson&#x27;s law, the magnetic counterpart to Ohm&#x27;s law, is named after him.

==Life and career==
John Hopkinson was born in Manchester, the eldest of 5 children. His father, also called John, was a mechanical engineer. He was educated at Queenwood School in Hampshire and Owens College in Manchester. He won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1867 and graduated in 1871 as Senior Wrangler, having placed first in the demanding Cambridge Mathematical Tripos examination. During this time he also studied for and passed the examination for a BSc from the University of London. Hopkinson could have followed a purely academic career but instead chose engineering as his vocation. He was a Cambridge Apostle.

After working first in his father&#x27;s engineering works, Hopkinson took a position in 1872 as an engineering manager in the lighthouse engineering department of Chance Brothers and Company in Smethwick. In 1877 Hopkinson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in recognition of his application of Maxwell&#x27;s theory of electromagnetism to problems of electrostatic capacity and residual charge. In 1878 he moved to London to work as a consulting engineer, focusing particularly on developing his ideas about how to improve the design and efficiency of dynamos. Hopkinson&#x27;s most important contribution was his three-wire distribution system, patented in 1882. In 1883 Hopkinson showed mathematically that it was possible to connect two alternating current dynamos in parallel-—a problem that had long bedevilled electrical engineers. He also studied magnetic permeability at high temperature, and discovered what was later called the Hopkinson peak effect.

The series-parallel method of electric motor control, for which Hopkinson was granted a British patent in 1881, would prove to be an important advance in the development of electric railways. He applied for a US patent in 1892, triggering an interference proceeding against American inventor Rudolph M Hunter, who had been granted a US patent for the method in 1888. The US Patent Office affirmed Hopkinson&#x27;s claim to priority of invention, but his British patent expired before the case was resolved, rendering him ineligible for a US patent (his US patent, had one been issued, would have expired concurrently with his British patent).

Hopkinson twice held the office of President of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. During his second term, Hopkinson proposed that the Institution should make available the technical knowledge of electrical engineers for the defence of the country. In 1897 the Volunteer Corps of Electrical Engineers was formed and Hopkinson became major in command of the corps.

==Personal life and legacy==

On 27 August 1898, Hopkinson and three of his six children, John Gustave, Alice and Lina Evelyn, were killed in a mountaineering accident on the Petite Dent de Veisivi, Val d&#x27;Hérens, in the Pennine Alps, Switzerland.

As a memorial to John Hopkinson and his son, the 1899 extension to the Engineering Laboratory in the New Museums Site of the University of Cambridge was named after him. A plaque commemorating this is fixed to the wall in Free School Lane. The Hopkinson and Imperial Chemical Industries Professorship of Applied Thermodynamics is named in his honour.

There is a memorial sundial to Alice Hopkinson in the gardens of Newnham College, Cambridge from which she had recently graduated; the Lina Evelyn Hopkinson Scholarship is awarded to pupils at Wimbledon High School for English Literature.

At the Victoria University of Manchester the Electro-technical Laboratory (1912) in Coupland Street was named after him.

His wife Evelyn (née Oldenburg), his two sons Bertram and Cecil, and his daughter Ellen (married James Alfred Ewing in 1912) are buried in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge; the rest of the family are interred in Switzerland. Cecil (1891-1917) shared rooms with Lawrence Bragg whilst they were both studying at Trinity College, Cambridge and they became firm friends, he incurred a severe head wound in the 1914-19 war and died a few months after being invalided back to the UK. Bragg subsequently married Cecil&#x27;s cousin Alice Hopkinson.

<doc id="250627" wikidata="Q1369235" url="?curid=250627" title="Programme Delivery Control">
<text>Programme delivery control (PDC) is specified by the standard ETS 300 231 (ETSI EN 300 231), published by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). This specifies the signals sent as hidden codes in the teletext service, indicating when transmission of a programme starts and finishes.

PDC (also known as Enhanced Teletext Packet 8/30 Format 2) is often used together with StarText, enabling the user to select a programme to record using specially coded teletext programme listings. The combination of features is often called PDC/StarText.

In Germany and some other European countries, the older standard video programming system (VPS) is in use also known as format 2. Effectively, the two systems do the same thing and most modern VCRs and stand-alone DVD recorders work with both signals.

In digital TV (see Freeview+), the feature Accurate Recording (AR) that was based on the PDC specification for analogue recording devices is now used for a DVB-SI event based scheduling system. This was due to the BBC discontinuing the Ceefax service.

==PDC Packets==
PDC is transmitted once a second in special packets addressed as magazine 8 and text row 30. Since this row is not displayable it does not interfere with normal pages. Packet 8/30 has various formats specified by ETSI and PDC is format 2. Each packet 8/30 format 2 also has a label number and there can be up to four labels transmitted at a time. Each label contains the scheduled start time and date for a programme and flags to indicate the state. Each programme is assigned a label and in general a label will follow this sequence.
* PRF Set – Prepare for Record. This will tell a VCR to wake up and get ready. This happens about 40 seconds before the programme is active.
* PRF Clear – The VCR should be recording.
* RTI – Record Terminate/Interrupt – Tells the VCR to stop recording. This label is held for 30 seconds after the programme ends.

There are complicated rules for the case where a programme is interrupted by another one as in the case of a film with a break for news in the middle.

There is also a TIMER flag that indicates that there is no valid PDC and that the VCR should use its own timer.

<doc id="250631" wikidata="Q904472" url="?curid=250631" title="Brecon">
<text>Brecon (; ; ), archaically known as Brecknock, is a market town in Powys, mid Wales. In 1841, it had a population of 5,701. The population in 2001 was 7,901, increasing to 8,250 at the 2011 census. Historically it was the county town of Brecknockshire (Breconshire); although its role as such was eclipsed with the formation of the County of Powys, it remains an important local centre. Brecon is the third-largest town in Powys, after Newtown and Ystradgynlais. It lies north of the Brecon Beacons mountain range, but is just within the Brecon Beacons National Park.

==History==

===Early history===
The Welsh name, Aberhonddu, means &quot;mouth of the Honddu&quot;. It is derived from the River Honddu, which meets the River Usk near the town centre, a short distance away from the River Tarell which enters the Usk a few hundred metres upstream. After the Dark Ages the original Welsh name of the kingdom in whose territory Brecon stands was (in modern orthography) &quot;Brycheiniog&quot;, which was later anglicised to Brecknock or Brecon, and probably derives from Brychan, the eponymous founder of the kingdom.

Before the building of the bridge over the Usk, Brecon was one of the few places where the river could be forded. In Roman Britain Y Gaer (&quot;Cicucium&quot;) was established as a Roman cavalry base for the conquest of Roman Wales and Brecon was first established as a military base.

===Norman control===
The confluence of the River Honddu and the River Usk made for a valuable defensive position for the Norman castle which overlooks the town, built by Bernard de Neufmarche in the late 11th century. Gerald of Wales came and made some speeches in 1188 to recruit men to go to the Crusades.

===Town walls===
Brecon&#x27;s town walls were constructed by Humphrey de Bohun after 1240. The walls were built of cobble, with four gatehouses and was protected by ten semi-circular bastions. In 1400 the Welsh prince Owain Glyndŵr rose in rebellion against English rule, and in response in 1404, 100 marks was spent by the royal government improving the fortifications to protect Brecon in the event of a Welsh attack. Brecon&#x27;s walls were largely destroyed during the English Civil War. Today only fragments survive, including some earthworks and parts of one of the gatehouses; these are protected as scheduled monuments.

In Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;King Richard III&quot;, the Duke of Buckingham is suspected of supporting the Welsh pretender Richmond (the future Henry VII), and declares:
&quot;O, let me think on Hastings and be goneTo Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!&quot;

===Priory and cathedral===

A priory was dissolved in 1538, and Brecon&#x27;s Dominican Friary of St Nicholas was suppressed in August of the same year. About north of the castle stands Brecon Cathedral, a fairly modest building compared to many cathedrals. The role of cathedral is a fairly recent one, and was bestowed upon the church in 1923 with the formation of the Diocese of Swansea and Brecon from what was previously the archdeaconry of Brecon — a part of the Diocese of St Davids.

===St Mary&#x27;s Church===
Saint Mary&#x27;s Church began as a chapel of ease to the priory but most of the building is dated to later medieval times. The West Tower, some high, was built in 1510 by Edward, Duke of Buckingham at a cost of £2,000. The tower has eight bells which have been rung since 1750, the heaviest of which weighs . They were cast by Rudhall of Gloucester. In March 2007 the bells were removed from the church tower for refurbishment. When the priory was elevated to the status of a cathedral, St Mary&#x27;s became the parish church. It is a Grade II* listed building.

===St David&#x27;s Church, Llanfaes===

The Church of St David, referred to locally as Llanfaes Church, was probably founded in the early sixteenth century. The first parish priest, Maurice Thomas, was installed there by John Blaxton, Archdeacon of Brecon in 1555. The name is derived from the Welsh – Llandewi yn y Maes – which translates as &#x27;St David&#x27;s in the field&#x27;.

===Plough Lane Chapel, Lion Street===
Plough Lane Chapel, also known as Plough United Reformed Church, is a Grade II* listed building. The present building dates back to 1841 and was re-modelled by Owen Morris Roberts.

===St Michael&#x27;s Church===
After the Reformation, some Breconshire families such as the Havards, the Gunters and the Powells persisted with Catholicism despite its suppression. In the 18th Century a Catholic Mass house in Watergate was active, and Rev John Williams was the local Catholic priest from 1788 to 1815. The present parish priest is Rev Father Jimmy Sebastian Pulickakunnel MCBS since 2012. The Watergate house was sold in 1805, becoming the current Watergate Baptist Chapel, and property purchased as the priest&#x27;s residence and a chapel between Wheat Street and the current St Michael Street, including the &quot;Three Cocks Inn&quot;; about this time Catholic parish records began again. The normal round of bishop&#x27;s visitations and confirmations resumed in the 1830s. In 1832 most civil liberties were restored to Catholics and they became able to practise their faith more openly. A simple Gothic church, dedicated to St Michael and designed by Charles Hansom, was built in 1851 at a cost of £1,000.

==Military town==
The east end of town has two military establishments:
* Dering Lines, home to the Infantry Battle School (formerly Infantry Training Centre Wales)
* The Barracks, Brecon, home to 160th (Wales) Brigade.
Approximately to the west of Brecon is Sennybridge Training Area, an important training facility for the British Army.

==Geography==
The town sits within the Usk valley at the point where the Honddu and Tarell rivers join it from north and south respectively. Two low hills overlook the town, the 331m high Pen-y-crug to its northwest and 231m high Slwch Tump to the east. Both are crowned by Iron Age hillforts. The modern administrative community includes the town of Brecon on the north bank of the Usk together with the smaller settlement of Llanfaes on its southern bank. Llanfaes is built largely on the floodplain of the Usk and the Tarell; embankments and walls protect parts of both Brecon and Llanfaes from this risk.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Brecon, at community (town) and county level: Brecon Town Council and Powys County Council. The town council is based at Brecon Guildhall on the High Street.

The town council elects a mayor annually. In May 2018 it elected its first mixed race mayor, local hotelier Emmanuel (Manny) Trailor.

===Controversy===
In 2010 the Town Council installed a plaque to the slave-trader Captain Thomas Phillips captain of the Hannibal slave ship. During the worldwide Black Lives Matter protests the plaque was removed and thrown into the River Usk. Following the protests the Council passed two resolutions on 20 September 2020 to display the plaque in the local museum, Y Gaer, and to request that it is displayed as part of a suitable exhibit detailing the wider context, without being restored. It was also resolved unanimously that a working group is established to consider whether a new plaque, new work of art, or loaned artwork should be commissioned, and where any new piece should be located.
===Administrative history===
Brecon was an ancient borough. Its date of becoming a borough is unknown, but it was described as having burgesses in 1100 and its first known charter was issued in 1276. Until 1536, the town formed part of the wider Lordship of Brecknock, a marcher lordship. In 1536 the new county of Brecknockshire was created, with Brecon as its county town.

The borough of Brecon&#x27;s responsibilities were originally primarily judicial, holding various courts. The borough council also owned the manorial rights to the borough, oversaw the town&#x27;s market and fairs, and ran elections for the borough&#x27;s member of parliament. In 1776 a separate body of improvement commissioners was established to supply the town with water and pave and light the streets.

The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standarised how most boroughs operated across the country. The improvement commissioners were abolished in 1850 when their functions were taken over by the borough council.

The borough was abolished in 1974, with its area instead becoming a community called Brecon within the larger Borough of Brecknock in the new county of Powys. The former borough council&#x27;s functions therefore passed to Brecknock Borough Council, which was in turn abolished in 1996 and its functions passed to Powys County Council.

==Education==

Brecon has primary schools, with a secondary school and further education college (Brecon Beacons College) on the northern edge of the town. The secondary school, known as Brecon High School, was formed from separate boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; grammar schools (&#x27;county schools&#x27;) and Brecon Secondary Modern School, after comprehensive education was introduced into Breconshire in the early 1970s. The town is home to an independent school, Christ College, which was founded in 1541.

==Transport==

The junction of the east–west A40 (London-Monmouth-Carmarthen-Fishguard) and the north–south A470 (Cardiff-Merthyr Tydfil-Llandudno) is on the east side of Brecon town centre. The nearest airport is Cardiff Airport.

The town&#x27;s primary public transport hub is the Brecon Interchange at the B4601 Heol Gouesnou, served mainly by the long-distance T4, T6 and T14 routes operated by TrawsCymru. Local services 40A and 40B, operated by Stagecoach South Wales, connect the town centre with the suburbs, operating at a roughly-hourly frequency.

===Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal===
The Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal runs for between Brecon and Pontnewydd, Cwmbran. It then continues to Newport, the towpath being the line of communication and the canal being disjointed by obstructions and road crossings. The canal was built between 1797 and 1812 to link Brecon with Newport and the Severn Estuary. The canalside in Brecon was redeveloped in the 1990s and is now the site of two mooring basins and Theatr Brycheiniog.

===Usk bridge===
The bridge carries the B4601 across the River Usk. A plaque on a house wall adjacent to the eastern end of the bridge records that the present bridge was built in 1563 to replace a medieval bridge destroyed by floods in 1535. It was repaired in 1772 and widened in 1794 by Thomas Edwards, the son of William Edwards of Eglwysilan. It had stone parapets until the 1970s when the present deck was superimposed on the old structure. The bridge was painted by J. M. W. Turner c.1769.

===Former railways===
The Neath and Brecon Railway reached Brecon in 1867, terminating at Free Street. By this point, Brecon already had two other railway stations:
* Watton – from 1 May 1863 when the Brecon and Merthyr Railway to Merthyr Tydfil was opened for traffic
* Mount Street – in September 1864, with Llanidloes by the Mid Wales Railway which linked to the Midland Railway at Talyllyn Junction. The three companies consolidated their stations at a newly rebuilt Free Street Joint Station from 1871 and the station finally closed in 1872

===Hereford, Hay and Brecon Railway===

The Hereford, Hay and Brecon Railway was opened gradually from Hereford towards Brecon. The first section opened in 1862, with passenger services on the complete line starting on 21 September 1864.
The Midland Railway Company (MR) took over the HH&amp;BR from 1 October 1869, leasing the line by an Act of 30 July 1874 and absorbing the HH&amp;BR in 1876. The MR was absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) on 1 January 1923.
Passenger services to Merthyr ended in 1958, Neath in October 1962 and Newport in December 1962. In 1962 the important line to Hereford closed. Therefore, Brecon lost all its train services before the 1963 &quot;Reshaping of British Railways&quot; report (often referred to as the Beeching Axe) was implemented.

==Culture==
Brecon hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1889.

August sees the annual Brecon Jazz Festival. Concerts are held in both open air and indoor venues, including the town&#x27;s market hall and the 400-seat Theatr Brycheiniog, which opened in 1997.

October sees the annual 4-day weekend Brecon Baroque Music Festival, organised by leading violinist Rachel Podger.

Idris Davies put &quot;the pink bells of Brecon&quot; in his poem published as XV in &quot;Gwalia Deserta&quot; (by T. S. Eliot). This was copied in &quot;Quite Early One Morning&quot; by Dylan Thomas, put to music by Pete Seeger as the song &quot;The Bells of Rhymney&quot;, then recorded by the Byrds where it became known to millions although by then the Brecon line had gone missing.

<doc id="250637" wikidata="Q232113" url="?curid=250637" title="Anna Karina">
<text>Anna Karina (born Hanne Karin Blarke Bayer; 23 September 1940 – 14 December 2019) was a Danish-French film actress, director, writer, model, and singer. She was an early collaborator of French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard, her first husband, performing in several of his films, including &quot;The Little Soldier&quot; (1960), &quot;A Woman Is a Woman&quot; (1961), &quot;My Life to Live&quot; (1962), &#x27; (&quot;Band of Outsiders&quot;; 1964),&#x27; (1965), and &quot;Alphaville&quot; (1965). For her performance in &quot;A Woman Is a Woman&quot;, Karina won the Silver Bear Award for Best Actress at the Berlin Film Festival.

In 1972, Karina set up a production company for &quot;Vivre ensemble&quot; (1973), her directorial debut, which screened in the Critics&#x27; Week lineup at the 26th Cannes Film Festival. She also directed the French-Canadian film &quot;Victoria&quot; (2008). In addition to her work in cinema, she worked as a singer and wrote several novels.

Karina was an icon of 1960s cinema, and referred to as the &quot;effervescent free spirit of the French New Wave, with all of the scars that the position entails&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her as &quot;one of the screen&#x27;s great beauties and an enduring symbol of the French New Wave&quot;.

== Early life ==
Hanne Karin Blarke Bayer was born on 22 September 1940 in Frederiksberg, Denmark. Her mother was a dress shop owner and her father was a ship captain who left the family a year after she was born.

She lived with her maternal grandparents for four years, then spent the next four years in foster care before returning to live with her mother and her abusive step-father when she was eight. As a child, her mother belittled her appearance, and told her that her eyes and forehead were too big. She has described her childhood as &quot;terribly wanting to be loved&quot;, as she felt unwanted and unloved. She made numerous attempts to run away from home, trying to find boats that would take her to Sweden or America. She dreamt of becoming an actor from a young age and wanted to attend drama school but at the time the age requirement for Danish drama schools was 21.

As a student, she rarely attended school and when she achieved good grades in her certificate exams, her school refused to believe she had done so without cheating. The injustice made her leave school at the age of 14.

== Career ==
=== Beginnings and modeling ===
After leaving school, she went on to find work as a lift operator in a department store and as an assistant to an illustrator.

She began her professional career in Denmark, where she sang in cabarets and worked as a model playing in commercials. Aged 14, she was spotted in the street by Ib Schmedes, who cast her as the lead in his forty-minute short film &quot;Pigen og skoene&quot; (&quot;The Girl and The Shoes,&quot; 1959), which won a prize at Cannes. However, as things did not seem to be going well at home, where one evening her step-father beat her very badly, she decided to leave. With the equivalent of $15, which she&#x27;d received from her grandfather, she hitchhiked to Paris. She has said that although she grew up in Denmark, she was &quot;fascinated&quot; by France and after traveling to Paris at age 14, she wanted to go back and live there.

In the summer of 1958, aged 17, Karina arrived in Paris. With only 10,000 francs and unable to speak French, she struggled to find a place to stay and had to ask neighborhood priests for somewhere to sleep. Finally, a young priest found her a small room on the rue Pavée, just behind the Bastille. One day, while starving and wandering through Paris, she found herself in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. She sat down at Les Deux Magots café, where a woman called Catherine Harlé approached her and asked her if she would be willing to do some photos. Suspicious at first, Karina finally agreed when she found out it was a professional shoot for the French newspaper &quot;Jours de France.&quot; After finishing the shoot, Harlé, although telling Karina that she wasn&#x27;t very talented, gave her some contacts.

She began to work as a model and eventually became successful, posing for several magazines, including &quot;Elle&quot;, and meeting Pierre Cardin and Coco Chanel. Karina has said that when she met Chanel on the set of the &quot;Elle&quot; photoshoot, Chanel told her: &quot;I believe you want to be an actress… You need to learn French. What&#x27;s your name little girl?&quot; &quot;Hanne Karin Bayer.&quot; Karina replied. And Chanel said: &quot;No: Anna Karina – call yourself that.&quot; It was deliberately coined to evoke Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s novel &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;. She also appeared in commercials for products such as Coca-Cola, Pepsodent, and Palmolive. She was still underage but received enough money to find herself a place to stay. And as she still wanted to attend drama school, she sat in movie theaters and watched French movies to teach herself the language.

=== Film ===

Jean-Luc Godard, then a film critic for &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;, first saw Karina in the Palmolive adverts in which she posed in bathtubs. He was casting his debut feature film &quot;Breathless&quot; (&quot;À bout de souffle&quot;, 1960), and offered her a small part in it, but she refused when he mentioned that there would be a nude scene. When Godard questioned her refusal, mentioning her apparent nudity in the Palmolive ads, she is said to have replied, &quot;Are you mad? I was wearing a bathing suit in those ads—the soapsuds went up to my neck. It was in your mind that I was undressed.&quot; In the end, the character Godard reserved for Karina did not appear in the film. Godard offered her a role in &quot;The Little Soldier&quot; (&quot;&quot;, not released until 1963) which concerns contentious French actions during the Algerian War. She played a pro-Algerian activist. Karina, then still under 21, had to persuade her estranged mother to sign the contract for her. The film was immediately controversial, outlawed from French theaters for its content referencing the Algerian War.

As Angela in &quot;A Woman Is a Woman&quot; (&quot;Une femme est une femme&quot;, 1961), Karina&#x27;s role was as an unattached striptease dancer who nevertheless wishes to have a child and daydreams about appearing in MGM musicals. Her school-girl costume emulated Leslie Caron in &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958), worn even while performing her act. Karina won the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 11th Berlin International Film Festival for her performance. In all, Karina appeared in eight films directed by Godard, including &quot;My Life to Live&quot; (&#x27;, 1962), &quot;Band of Outsiders&quot; (&#x27;, 1964) &#x27; and &quot;Alphaville&quot; (both 1965). In &#x27;, Karina&#x27;s character is on the run with her ex-boyfriend, while in &quot;Alphaville&quot;, a science-fiction film often equated to &quot;Bladerunner&quot;, Karina&#x27;s role requires her to have difficulty saying the phrase &quot;I love you.&quot; The last film in the sequence was &quot;Made in USA&quot; (1966). Anne Billson, in an article querying the concept of the female muse, wrote that Godard in his films with Karina &quot;seems to have trouble conceiving that the female experience revolves around anything other than prostitution, duplicity, or wanting babies.&quot; Karina herself did not object to being described as Godard&#x27;s muse: &quot;Maybe it&#x27;s too much, it sounds so pompous. But of course I&#x27;m always very touched to hear people say that. Because Jean-Luc gave me a gift to play all of those parts.&quot;

Her career flourished, with Karina appearing in dozens of films through the 1960s, including: &quot;The Nun&quot; (&quot;La Religieuse&quot;, 1966), directed by Jacques Rivette; Luchino Visconti&#x27;s &quot;The Stranger&quot; (&quot;Lo straniero&quot;, 1967); the George Cukor/Joseph Strick collaboration &quot;Justine&quot; (1969); and Tony Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Laughter in the Dark&quot; (1969). She continued to work steadily into the 1970s, with roles in Christian de Chalonge&#x27;s &quot;The Wedding Ring&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Alliance&quot;, 1971), Andre Delvaux&#x27;s &quot;Rendezvous at Bray&quot; (&quot;Rendez-vous à Bray&quot;, also 1971), &quot;The Salzburg Connection&quot; (1972), and Franco Brusati&#x27;s &quot;Bread and Chocolate&quot; (&quot;Pane e cioccolata&quot;, 1973).
In 1972, she set up the production company for &quot;Living Together&quot; (&quot;Vivre ensemble&quot;, 1973), her directorial debut, in which she also acted. The film screened in the Critics&#x27; Week lineup at the 26th Cannes Film Festival.

She starred in Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#x27;s &quot;Chinese Roulette&quot; (&quot;Chinesisches Roulette&quot;, 1976); Fassbinder allegedly wrote the film for her and Ulli Lommel, her partner at the time. She later wrote and acted in &quot;Last Song&quot; (1987) and appeared in &quot;Up, Down, Fragile&quot; (&quot;Haut bas fragile&quot;, 1995), directed by Jacques Rivette, and sang in &quot;The Truth About Charlie&quot; (2002), a remake of the film &quot;Charade&quot; (1963).

Karina wrote, directed and starred in &quot;Victoria&quot; (2008), a musical road movie filmed in Montreal and Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec. The lead character, played by Karina, has amnesia. Richard Kuipers praised it in &quot;Variety&quot; as &quot;a pleasant gambol through the backwoods of Quebec.&quot;

=== Music and writing ===
Karina maintained a singing career. At the end of the 1960s, she scored a major hit with &quot;Sous le soleil exactement&quot; and &quot;Roller Girl&quot; by Serge Gainsbourg. Both songs are from the TV musical comedy &quot;Anna&quot; (1967), by the film director Pierre Koralnik, in which she sings seven songs alongside Gainsbourg and Jean-Claude Brialy. Karina recorded the album &quot;&quot; with Philippe Katerine, followed by a concert tour. In 2005, she released &quot;Chansons de films&quot;, a collection of songs sung in movies.

Karina wrote four novels: &#x27; (1973), &quot;Golden City&quot; (1983), &#x27; (1988), and &quot;Jusqu&#x27;au bout du hasard&quot; (1998).

== Personal life ==

While working together on &#x27;, as the crew were having a dinner party in Lausanne, Godard wrote a note and gave it to Karina, saying: &quot;I love you, come and meet me at midnight in a café called Café de la Prez.&quot; At the time Karina was in a relationship but she had already fallen in love with Godard so she ended her relationship with her then-boyfriend and went to meet Godard. They began a relationship and married in 1961. Eventually, Karina served as a cinematic muse to Godard, appearing in eight of his films, including &#x27;, and &quot;&quot;, during their five-year marriage and after. Karina liked being the muse, stating in 2016: &quot;How could I not be honoured? Maybe it&#x27;s too much, it sounds so pompous. But of course I&#x27;m always very touched to hear people say that. Because Jean-Luc gave me a gift to play all of those parts. It was like &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, you know? I was Eliza Doolittle and he was the teacher.&quot; The couple became, according to &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;one of the most celebrated pairings of the 1960s.&quot; A writer for &quot;Filmmaker&quot; magazine called their work &quot;arguably the most influential body of work in the history of cinema.&quot; Despite the critical success, their relationship behind the scenes was described as tumultuous; they fought on film sets, she fell ill several times, attempted suicide and was subsequently hospitalized in a mental health institution. Godard was often absent without explanation. He was also very jealous, questioned Karina&#x27;s acting ability and told her: &quot;How are you going to say these lines? They&#x27;re so terrible! It&#x27;s a comedy, you are never going to be able to do that.&quot;

One Godard film from this period which does not feature Karina, &quot;Contempt&quot; (1963) starring Brigitte Bardot wearing a black wig which resembles Karina&#x27;s dark hair, is said to be based on their difficult relationship. The couple divorced in 1965.

Karina said in spring 2016 that she and Godard no longer spoke to each other. She described the relationship in an interview with &quot;W&quot; magazine:It was all very exciting from the beginning. Of course we have a great love story and all that, but we were so different. He was 10 years older than me. He was very strange. He would go away and come back three weeks later... It was difficult, and I was a young girl, not even 21—at the time Godard was 30. I know he didn&#x27;t mean to hurt me, but he did. He was never there, he was never coming back, and I never knew where he was. He drove me a bit crazy.After divorcing Godard, Karina remarried three times; she was married to French actors Pierre Fabre from 1968 to 1974 and Daniel Duval from 1978 to 1981, and to American film director Dennis Berry from 1982 until her death.

Karina died at the age of 79 on Saturday, 14 December 2019, at a hospital in Paris. According to her agent, Laurent Balandras, the cause of death was cancer. However, her husband Dennis Berry said that the cause was not cancer, but a complication following a muscular rupture.

== Legacy ==
Karina is regularly considered an icon of 1960s cinema, a staple in French New Wave cinema, as well as a style icon. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described her as an &quot;effervescent free spirit of the French new wave.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her style as looking like a schoolgirl in her acting roles, regardless of whether she was playing a streetwalker or a terrorist. Her signature look was her dark hair, wispy bangs, heavy eyeliner and school uniform of primary-coloured sailor-uniform tops, knee socks, plaid headwear such as berets and boaters. Refinery29 wrote that &quot;her 60s French girl style – think sailor dresses, tartan, long socks, and hats – and mesmerizing doe-eyed beauty mean she continues to be referenced today by the super-stylish.&quot;

<doc id="250638" wikidata="Q179406" url="?curid=250638" title="Grimsby">
<text>Grimsby or Great Grimsby is a port town in Lincolnshire, England with a population of 86,138 (as of 2021). It is located near the mouth on the south bank of the Humber that flows to the North Sea. Grimsby adjoins the town of Cleethorpes directly to the south-east forming a conurbation. It is the administrative centre of the borough of North East Lincolnshire, which alongside North Lincolnshire is officially part of the Yorkshire and the Humber region. Grimsby is north-east of Lincoln, (via the Humber Bridge) south-east of Hull, and east of Doncaster.

Grimsby has notable landmarks including Grimsby Minster, Port of Grimsby, Cleethorpes Beach and Grimsby Fishing Heritage Centre. Grimsby was once the home port for the world&#x27;s largest fishing fleet around the mid-20th century, but fishing then fell sharply. The Cod Wars denied UK access to Icelandic fishing grounds and the European Union used its Common Fisheries Policy to parcel out fishing quotas to other European countries in waters within of the UK coast. Grimsby suffered post-industrial decline like most other industrial towns and cities in the UK. 

Food production has been on the rise in Grimsby since the 1990s. The Grimsby–Cleethorpes conurbation acts as a cultural and economic centre for much of north and east Lincolnshire. Grimsby people are called Grimbarians. The term &quot;&quot; is also used jokingly, often for football supporters. Great Grimsby Day is 22 January. Grimsby is the second largest settlement by population in Lincolnshire after Lincoln.

==Geography==

The town was named &quot;Great Grimsby&quot; to distinguish it from Little Grimsby, a village about to the south, near Louth. It had a population of 88,243 in the 2011 census and an estimated population of 88,323 in 2019. It forms a conurbation with Cleethorpes and the villages of Humberston, Scartho, Brigsley and Waltham. The 2011 population of the conurbation was 134,160, making it the largest built-up area in Lincolnshire.

==History==
There is archaeological evidence of a small town of Roman workers in the area in the 2nd century AD during Roman occupation. Located on The Haven, which flowed into the Humber, the site long provided a location for ships to shelter from approaching storms. It was well placed to exploit the rich fishing grounds in the North Sea.

===Vikings===
Sometime in the 9th century AD, Grimsby was settled by Danes. Local folklore claims that the name Grimsby derives from &quot;Grim,&quot; a Danish (as an old term closer to &quot;Viking&quot;) fisherman. The common toponymic suffix &quot;-by&quot; is derived from the Old Norse word for village (compare with , and ). The legendary founding of Grimsby features in a medieval romance, the &quot;Lay of Havelock the Dane,&quot; but historians see this account as a myth.

In Norse mythology, &quot;Grim&quot; (Mask) and &quot;Grimnir&quot; (Masked One) are names adopted by the deity Oðin (Anglo-Saxon &quot;Woðen&quot;) when travelling incognito amongst mortals, as in the short poem known as &quot;Grimnir&#x27;s Sayings&quot; (&quot;Grimnismal&quot;) in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. The intended audience of the Havelock tale, recorded much later as the &quot;Lay of Havelock the Dane&quot;, may have taken the fisherman Grim to be Odin in disguise.

The Oðinic name &quot;Grimr/Grim&quot; occurs in many English place names in the historical Danelaw and elsewhere in Britain. Examples are numerous earthworks named &quot;Grimsdyke&quot;. Other British place names with the element &quot;Grim&quot; are explained as referring to Woðen/Oðin (e.g. Grimsbury, Grimspound, Grime&#x27;s Graves, Grimsditch, Grimsworne), and Grimsby is likely to have the same derivation.

Grimsby is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as having a population of around 200, a priest, a mill, and a ferry.

===Medieval times===
In the 12th century, Grimsby grew into a fishing and trading port, at one time ranking twelfth in importance to the Crown for tax revenue. The town gained its charter from King John in 1201. The first mayor was installed in 1202.

Grimsby is noted in the in this stanza by Kali Kolsson:
Grimsby had no town walls. It was too small and felt to be protected by the marshland around it. However, the town dug a defensive ditch.

Grimsby in medieval times had two parish churches, St Mary&#x27;s and St James. St James, now Grimsby Minster, remains. It is associated with a folk tale of an imp who played tricks in the church and was turned into stone by an angel. A similar tale is told of Lincoln Cathedral – see Lincoln Imp.

In the mid-14th century, Grimsby benefited from the generosity of Edmund de Grimsby, a local man who became a senior Crown official and judge in Ireland.

In the 15th century, The Haven began to silt up, preventing ships in the Humber from docking. As a result, Grimsby entered a long period of decline until the late 18th century. In 1801, the population of Grimsby was 1,524, around the size it had been in the Middle Ages. 
By 1810 Joseph Smedley was hiring a purpose built theatre for seven Guineas.

===Rise of fishing and maritime industry===
In May 1796, the Grimsby Haven Company was formed by the Great Grimsby (Lincoln) Harbour Act 1796 (36 Geo. 3. c. 98), also known as the Grimsby Haven Act 1796, for the purpose of &quot;widening, deepening, enlarging, altering and improving the Haven of the Town and Port of Great Grimsby&quot;. After the dredging of The Haven and related improvement in the early 19th century, Grimsby grew rapidly as the port boomed, importing iron, timber, wheat, hemp, and flax. New docks were needed to cope with the expansion. The necessary works were allowed under the Grimsby Docks Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. ccii).

In 1848, the arrival of the railway eased the transport of goods to and from the port to markets and farms. Coal mined in the South Yorkshire coalfields was brought by rail and exported through Grimsby. Rail links direct to London and the Billingsgate Fish Market allowed fresh &quot;Grimsby fish&quot; to gain nationwide renown. The first true fish dock opened in Grimsby in 1856, and the town became central to the development of the commercial fishing industry.

The Dock Tower was completed in 1851, followed by the Royal Dock in 1852. No.1 Fish Dock was completed in 1856, followed by No.2 Fish Dock in 1877. Alexandra Dock and Union Dock were completed in 1879. During this period, the fishing fleet was much expanded. In a rare reversal of usual trends, large numbers of fishermen from the south-east and Devon travelled north to join the Grimsby fleet. Over 40 per cent of the newcomers came from Barking in East London and other Thames-side towns. 

In 1857, there were 22 vessels in Grimsby. Six years later there were 112. The first two legitimate steam trawlers built in Britain were based in Grimsby. A gale in February 1889 resulted in the loss of fifteen smacks and 70 to 80 lives. At that time it was thought to be one of the most serious losses to a single port. 

By 1900, a tenth of the fish consumed in the United Kingdom was landed there, although there were also many smaller coastal fishing ports and villages involved. The demand for fish in Grimsby meant that at its peak in the 1950s it claimed to be the largest fishing port in the world. The population grew from 75,000 in 1901 to 92,000 by 1931. 
 The Great Depression and restructured fishing caused a sharp decline in employment. After that the population was fairly stable for the rest of the 20th century.

===Second World War===
The Royal Dock became the UK&#x27;s largest base for minesweepers patrolling the North Sea. The Admiralty requisitioned numerous trawlers to serve the purpose of the Royal Naval Patrol Service. Often the crew was ex-trawlermen, alongside Royal Naval Reserve and Royal Navy volunteers. Trawlers used the winches and warps from fishing operations to tow a paravane with a cutting jaw through the water in what was known as a &quot;sweep&quot; to bring mines to the surface and allow for their removal.

This hazardous work lost the Patrol Service more vessels than any other Royal Navy branch in the Second World War; 2,385 men died. Grimsby&#x27;s Royal Naval Patrol Service veterans financed a memorial beside the Dock Tower to ensure that the bravery and sacrifice of their comrades were not forgotten.

On 14 June 1943, an early-morning air raid by the Luftwaffe dropped several 1,000-kg bombs, 6,000 incendiary bombs and over 3,000 Butterfly Bombs in the Grimsby area, killing 99 people. In total, Second World War bombing raids in Grimsby and Cleethorpes killed 196, while another 184 were seriously injured. The Butterfly Bombs that littered the area hampered fire-fighting crews trying to reach locations damaged by incendiary bombs. The search for bodies continued for a month after the raid.

===Post-Second World War===
After the pressures placed on the industry during the Cod Wars and the European Union&#x27;s Common Fisheries Policy, which redistributed fishing quotas to other EU nations, many Grimsby firms decided to cease trawling operations there. The sudden demise of the industry brought an end to a way of life and community that had lasted for generations. The loss of the fishing industry brought severe economic and social problems for the town. Huge numbers became redundant, highly skilled in jobs that no longer existed, and struggled to find work ashore. As with the Ross Group, some firms concentrated on expanding industries within the town, such as food processing.
Grimsby&#x27;s trawling days are remembered through artefacts and permanent exhibits at the town&#x27;s Fishing Heritage Centre. A preserved 1950s trawler, &quot;Ross Tiger,&quot; is located here. Few fishing vessels still operate from Grimsby&#x27;s docks, but the town maintains a substantial fish market important in Europe.

Grimsby was struck by an F1/T3 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of a record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak that day. From the mid-1980s, the former Humber ferry PS &quot;Lincoln Castle&quot; has been moored in Alexandra Dock. She was used during this time as a pub\restaurant, but despite her design and status as Britain&#x27;s last coal-fired paddle steamer, the catering no longer yielded a profit. The ship was broken up in 2010. Berthed in Alexandra Dock is the &quot;Ross Tiger&quot;, the last survivor of what was once the world&#x27;s largest fleet of sidewinder trawlers.

The town was described in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2001 as one &quot;subjected to... many crude developments over the past 30-odd years&quot; and a town which &quot;seemingly shuns the notion of heritage.&quot; Redevelopment was planned as part of Yorkshire Forward&#x27;s Renaissance Towns Programme, but the scheme was abandoned in 2012.

In the early 21st century, the town faced the challenges of a post-industrial economy on top of the decline in its fishing industry. The East Marsh ward of the town is the second most deprived in the country, according to government statistics.
== Demographics ==
A little under half of the population of Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes reported a religious affiliation in the 2021 Census, mainly Christian, with Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh, Jewish and other minorities making up around 3% of the population. In 2024, 95.7% of the population of Grimsby town identified with a white ethnic group.

==Governance==
Since the December 2019 general election, Lia Nici (Conservative) has been the Member of Parliament for the Great Grimsby constituency, having won the seat from the former MP, Melanie Onn (Labour), who had served since 2015. This lost the seat to the Labour Party for the first time in 74 years, not least under Austin Mitchell (Labour), who held it from 1977 to 2015.
Great Grimsby formed an ancient Borough in the North Riding of Lindsey. It was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 and became a Municipal Borough in that year. In 1889 a County Council was created for Lindsey, but Great Grimsby was outside its area of control and formed an independent County Borough in 1891. The Borough expanded to absorb the adjacent hamlet of Wellow (1889), also the neighbouring parishes of Clee-with-Weelsby (1889), Little Coates (1928), Scartho (1928), Weelsby (1928) and Great Coates (1968). It had its own police force until 1967 when it was merged into the Lincolnshire force.

In 1974, the County Borough was abolished and Great Grimsby was reconstituted with the same boundaries as &quot;Grimsby&quot; non-metropolitan district in the new county of Humberside, under the Local Government Act 1972. The district was renamed &quot;Great Grimsby&quot; in 1979.

In the early 1990s, area local government came under review from the Local Government Commission for England; Humberside was abolished in 1996. The former Great Grimsby district merged with that of Cleethorpes to form the unitary authority of North East Lincolnshire. The town does not have its own town council, instead just a board of Charter Trustees. In 2007, in the struggle for identity, it was suggested that the district be renamed &quot;Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes&quot;, but this did not meet with favour among local residents, and the Council Leader dropped the idea a year later.

===Council wards===
North East Lincolnshire Council has eight Council wards within the area of Grimsby:
*Freshney Ward
*Heneage Ward
*Scartho Ward
*South Ward
*East Marsh Ward
*Park Ward
*West Marsh Ward
*Yarborough Ward

==Economy==
The main sectors of the economy are ports and logistics, food processing, specifically frozen foods and fish processing, chemicals and process industries and digital media. Cleethorpes to the east has a tourist industry. To the west along the Humber bank to Immingham, there has been large-scale industrial activity since the 1950s, around chemicals and from the 1990s gas-powered electricity generation.

===Food industry===

Grimsby is strongly linked with the sea fishing industry that once generated wealth for the town. At its peak in the 1950s, it was the largest and busiest fishing port in the world. The Cod Wars with Iceland, and the European Union&#x27;s Common Fisheries Policy sent this industry into decline for many years. In 1970 around 400 trawlers were based in the port, but by 2013 only five remained, while 15 vessels were being used to maintain offshore wind farms in the North Sea. The town still has the largest fish market in the UK, but most of what is sold is brought overland from other ports or from Iceland by containerisation. Of the 18,000 tonnes of fresh fish sold in Grimsby fish market in 2012, almost 13,000 tonnes, mainly cod and haddock, came from Iceland.

Grimsby houses some 500 food-related companies, as one of the largest concentrations of such firms in Europe. The local council has promoted Grimsby as &quot;Europe&#x27;s Food Town&quot; for nearly 20 years. In 1999, the BBC reported that more pizzas were produced than anywhere else in Europe, including Italy.

Grimsby is recognised as the main centre of the UK fish-processing industry; 70 per cent of the UK&#x27;s fish-processing industry is located there. In recent years, this expertise has led to diversification into all forms of frozen and chilled foods. It is one of the largest centres of fish processing in Europe. More than 100 local companies are involved in fresh and frozen fish production, the largest being the Findus Group (see Lion Capital LLP), comprising Young&#x27;s Seafood and Findus, with its corporate headquarters in the town. Young&#x27;s is a major employer, with some 2,500 people based at its headquarters. From this base, Young&#x27;s has a global sourcing operation supplying 60 species from 30 countries.

Traditional Grimsby smoked fish was awarded a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) in 2009 by the European Union. The traditional process uses overnight cold smoking from sawdust in tall chimneys, roughly square and 10m high.

Other major seafood companies include the Icelandic-owned &quot;Coldwater Seafood&quot;, employing more than 700 across its sites in Grimsby; and &quot;Five Star Fish&quot;, a supplier of fish products to the UK food market.

The £5.6 million Humber Seafood Institute, the first of its kind in the UK, opened in 2008. Backed by Yorkshire Forward, North East Lincolnshire Council and the European Regional Development Fund, it is managed by the local council. Tenants include the Seafish Industry Authority and Grimsby Institute and University Centre. Greater Grimsby is a European centre of excellence in producing chilled prepared meals, and the area has Europe&#x27;s largest concentration of cold-storage facilities.

===Docks===

The Port of Grimsby has been in use since the medieval period. The first enclosed dock, later known as the Old Dock, was built in the 1790s by the Grimsby Haven Company. Major expansion came with the railways and construction of the Royal Dock, Grimsby in the 1840s. A Fish Dock was added in 1857, and the fish docks expanded over the next 80 years. The Old Dock was expanded to form Alexandra Dock in the 1880s. The Kasbah is a historic area between the Royal Dock and Fish Dock marked by a network of streets that remains home to many artisan fish-processing businesses.

Fishing activities were reduced to a fraction of former levels in the second half of the 20th century. The current port has become a centre for car imports and exports, and since 1975 for general cargo. In the early 21st century, it has developed as a wind-farm maintenance base.

===Retail===
High-street shopping is grouped in central Grimsby between the railway and River Freshney, where Victoria Street acts as a central pedestrianised shopping street with an undercover Freshney Place centre to the north. Freshney Place is visited by 14 million shoppers a year and employs over 2,000 staff. The centre houses over 100 stores, including Marks and Spencer and House of Fraser. Constructed between 1967 and 1971 in a joint venture between the old &quot;Grimsby Borough Council&quot; and developers Hammerson&#x27;s UK Ltd., it was known as the &quot;Riverhead Centre&quot; (so named as the development was adjacent to where the two local rivers, the Freshney and the Haven, meet). Hammerson&#x27;s UK Ltd began a £100 million redevelopment of the retail centre, doubling it in size. The expanded centre was covered in a glass roof. Two multi-storey car parks were constructed at each end of the centre; with this development, the old &quot;Top Town&quot; area of Grimsby was effectively privatised and roofed over. Stores are serviced at the first floor by ramps at the western end, which can accommodate even large vehicles. The ramp also provides access to the car park on the roof of the indoor market, which is operated by the local council. Freshney Place won a design commendation in the Refurbishment Category of the 1993 BCSC awards.

In the town centre Bethlehem and Osborne Street are also mixed in use, hosting retail, legal and service functions to the south of Victoria Street. Many local independent stores operate, several at the &quot;Abbeygate Centre&quot; off Bethlehem Street. Once the head office of local brewers &quot;Hewitt Brothers&quot;, the building was renovated in the mid-1980s and now houses restaurants and designer clothing stores.

The town has two markets, one next to Freshney Place and the other in &quot;Freeman Street&quot; (B1213). This was a dominant shopping area with close ties to the docks, but industry and demographic changes have led it to struggle since the late 1970s. Previously the town centre area was rivalled by the Freeman Street shopping area, located closer to the docks. Freeman Street retains its covered market. Grimsby town centre has re-emerged in prominence as the docks declined and shops such as Marks and Spencer relocated to central Grimsby.

Other developments near the town centre since the 1980s include the Alexandra Retail Park and Sainsbury&#x27;s to the west of Alexandra Dock, an Asda store between the town centre and Freeman Street, and the Victoria Mills Retail Park off the Peaks Parkway A16, which has several chain stores, including Next and close to a Tesco Extra (the second in the area. B&amp;Q opened a large store off the Peaks Parkway to the east of the town centre. Unlike many towns where shopping has been built on the outskirts, these and similar developments were placed around Grimsby&#x27;s town centre. This keeps shopping in a compact area, easier on pedestrians and public transport users.
Some out-of-town development has taken place, with Morrisons building a store just outside the town in the parish of Laceby. It is known as Morrisons Cleethorpes. This name derives from a period when the area was part of the now defunct Cleethorpes Borough. Most major supermarkets have expanded in the early 21st century, including Asda, and Tesco at Hewitts Circus, which is technically in adjoining Cleethorpes.

Such is the quality of shopping in the area that bus services bring shoppers from across Lincolnshire, especially smaller towns such as Louth, Brigg, and Scunthorpe.

===Renewable energy===
Grimsby is beginning to develop as an energy centre. In 2016, Grimsby generated more electricity from renewable solar, wind, biomass and landfill gas than anywhere else in England. In 2016, Grimsby sourced 28 per cent of its electricity from green sources. Its proximity to the biggest cluster of offshore wind farms in Europe has brought around 1,500 jobs to the area, most of them in turbine maintenance.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Grimsby is north-east of Lincoln, (via the Humber Bridge) south-south-east of Hull, south-east of Scunthorpe, east of Doncaster and south-east of Leeds.

=== Flooding ===

The Environment Agency has awarded Sheffield-based telemetry company CSE Seprol a contract to supply flood-warning devices for risk areas in East Anglia. The 18 sirens, at various locations round the flood-risk area of Grimsby and Cleethorpes, should reach 25,500 households to warn of flood danger. They will be sounded only in the event of the Environment Agency issuing a severe flood warning for tidal flooding, or if it is likely the sea defences will be breached. The sirens make various sounds, from the traditional wail to a voice message.

==Education==

Secondary schools in Grimsby include Oasis Academy Wintringham and Ormiston Maritime Academy. Private schools include St James&#x27; School. 
Park House mainly teaches pupils who have been suspended or excluded by other schools, and according to BBC News is &quot;turning many of those lives around&quot;.

Franklin College is a sixth form college. The Grimsby Institute offers further and higher education courses mostly for vocational purposes. Its business courses have attracted a sizeable number of Chinese students in recent years.

==Transport==
Grimsby lies from the nearest motorway, the M180, which continues as A180 into the town and acts as a link with the national motorway network. The town is skirted by the A18, with the A46 passing through to provide a connection towards Lincoln, while the A16 links it to Louth and south and eastern Lincolnshire. The transport infrastructure was described in a report by the European Commission as strong and as a help to Grimsby&#x27;s transition to a food-processing centre. It was once derided as being &quot;on the road to nowhere&quot; by the writer and critic A. A. Gill.

===Buses===

Grimsby&#x27;s bus services are provided by Stagecoach in Lincolnshire, which took over from &quot;Grimsby-Cleethorpes Transport&quot; (CGT) in 1993. This had been formed in 1957 by a merger of separate Grimsby and Cleethorpes transport undertakings. Stagecoach had all the buses resprayed to their standard livery to replace the colour scheme of orange and white introduced in 1987. GCT ran a mixture of crewed and one-person operated services, but in 1982 the job of the conductor was abolished.

In 2005, Stagecoach bought out &quot;Lincolnshire Road Car&quot;, which served South Killingholme, Louth, Barton-upon-Humber and the Willows Estate. The company is now known as Stagecoach in Lincolnshire. Joint ticketing began with &quot;Stagecoach Grimsby-Cleethorpes&quot; in May 2006. From September 2006, a new fleet of low-floor single-deckers was introduced, making the fleet an unprecedented 85 per cent low-floor.

The main bus exchange in Grimsby is Riverhead Exchange.
===Railways===
Grimsby has rail links via Grimsby Town railway station and Grimsby Docks railway station. There is a level crossing in the centre of the town across &quot;Wellowgate&quot;. TransPennine Express provides direct trains to Manchester Airport via Doncaster and Sheffield, whilst East Midlands Railway operates services to Barton-upon-Humber, for buses to Hull, Northern has Saturday service to Sheffield via Brigg but it is temporarily suspended. The Leicester Via Lincoln &amp; Nottingham are served by East Midlands Railway. The service to Cleethorpes runs at least hourly during the day along a single track, passing stations at Grimsby Docks and New Clee.

===Erstwhile trams===
Grimsby had two tramway networks: the &quot;Grimsby District Light Railway&quot; and the &quot;Grimsby &amp; Immingham Electric Railway&quot;.

Grimsby Electric was a normal-gauge tramway opened in 1912 between Corporation Bridge at Grimsby and Immingham. There was no physical connection with the railway system. It provided passenger services between Grimsby and Immingham until it closed in 1961. It is claimed that once this was controlled by the corporation, it had more interest in supporting the motorbus service, now No. 45.

Grimsby Light Railway opened in 1881 using horse-drawn trams. In 1901, these were replaced with electric tramways. In 1925 the Grimsby Transport Company bought the tramway company and in 1927 moved the depot to the Victoria Street Depot, an old sea plane hangar. This system closed in 1937. The depot continues to be used by Stagecoach, although the old Grimsby Tramways livery is still visible on the front of the building.

Operating in the area until the 1950s was a network of electrically operated trolleybuses served by overhead power lines.

===Airport===
Humberside Airport is west of Grimsby and mainly caters for charter holidays. It is popular for general aviation, with five flying clubs based there.

==Sport==
===Football===

The local football team Grimsby Town F.C., nicknamed The Mariners, has played in League Two, the fourth tier of English football, since its promotion from the Vanarama National League in the 2021/22 season. Its ground is Blundell Park in Cleethorpes. It is the oldest professional football team in Lincolnshire and one of the oldest in the country, being formed in 1878 as Grimsby Pelham, with a home ground on land off Ainslie Street. 

In the 1930s Grimsby Town played in the English First Division, then the highest level of the domestic game in England. Grimsby played in two FA Cup semi-finals in the 1930s: in 1936 against Arsenal, and in 1939 against the Wolverhampton Wanderers. The latter semi-final was held at Old Trafford, Manchester, and the attendance (76,962) is still a record for the stadium.

In May 2010, Grimsby Town was relegated to the Football Conference, losing its status as a League club. It returned to the Football League after gaining promotion via the National League play-off final in 2016, beating Forest Green Rovers 3–1 at Wembley Stadium. The team reached the FA Cup quarter-finals in 1987 and in 1998 won the Auto Windscreens Shield and the second division play-off final. Notable former managers include Bill Shankly, Lawrie McMenemy and Alan Buckley.

Blundell Park&#x27;s Main Stand is the oldest in English professional football. It opened in 1899, although only the present foundations date from that time. There have been plans to relocate the club to a new stadium, including one at the side of Peaks Parkway in Grimsby.

Grimsby Borough F.C. is a football club established in 2003 and based in Grimsby. It belongs to the Northern Counties East League Division One.

===Other sports===
An ice hockey club has been based in Grimsby since 1936. It has teams playing at various levels throughout the English Ice Hockey Association structure, under the name of Grimsby Red Wings. In 2009 the club added an ice sled hockey team to ensure that it was able to offer a fully inclusive sport for the NE Lincolnshire area.

The amateur Rugby Union side, the Grimsby RUFC, and an amateur cricket side, the Grimsby Town Cricket Club, attract reasonable levels of support. The Grimsby Scorpions American Football team operated until 2014 before relocating to Hull, where it merged with Hull&#x27;s team as Humber Warhawks. Despite playing in another county the club maintains representation of both East Yorkshire and North East Lincolnshire.

Tennis teams from local clubs have been successful in various inter-county competitions. The men&#x27;s team from Grimsby Tennis Centre won the Lincolnshire Doubles League in 2005. Tennis players from the town represent the county on a regular basis at all age levels. Grimsby Tennis Centre underwent a major redevelopment of facilities in 2005 and is now wholly accessible to disabled people.

The town had one of the largest table tennis leagues in the country, with over 120 teams competing in the 1970s, but like the game of squash, the sport has declined in the town during recent years.

==Culture and attractions==
===Entertainment===

Before the late 1960s many public houses in the area were owned by the local brewer Hewitt Brothers and had a distinctive local touch. In 1969, it was taken over by the brewer Bass-Charrington. The pubs have been re-badged many times, closed or sold off. &quot;The Barge Inn&quot; is a former grain barge converted into a pub/restaurant. It has been moored at the Riverhead quay since 1982.
Musical entertainment is provided at the Grimsby Auditorium, built in 1995 in Cromwell Road, Yarborough, near Grimsby Leisure Centre. The smaller Caxton Theatre is in Cleethorpe Road (A180) in East Marsh, near the docks. The Caxton Theatre provides entertainment by adults and youths in theatre. Notable in the area is the Class Act Theatre Company run by the local playwright David Wrightam.

North East Lincolnshire Council has installed a Wi-Fi network covering Victoria Street in central Grimsby. The service gives access to the Internet to the general public on a yearly subscription.

Grimsby&#x27;s Freeman Street cinema closed in 2004, leaving the Parkway cinema in Cleethorpes to serve the town. Periodic plans to build a new cinema in Grimsby have been made since. The Whitgift Film Theatre in John Whitgift Academy shows a programme of limited release and art-house films.

<text>Pembroke ( ; ) is a town and community in Pembrokeshire, Wales, with a population of 7,552. The names of both the town and the county (of which the county town is Haverfordwest) have a common origin; both are derived from the Cantref of Penfro: , &#x27;head&#x27; or &#x27;end&#x27;, and , &#x27;region&#x27;, &#x27;country&#x27;, &#x27;land&#x27;, which has been interpreted to mean either &#x27;Land&#x27;s End&#x27; or &#x27;headland&#x27;.

Pembroke features a number of historic buildings, town walls, complexes and Pembroke Castle which was the birthplace of Henry Tudor, who became .

==History==
Pembroke Castle, the substantial remains of a stone medieval fortress founded by the Normans in 1093, stands at the western tip of a peninsula surrounded by water on three sides. The castle was the seat of the powerful Earls of Pembroke and the birthplace of King Henry VII of England. Gerald de Windsor was the first recorded Constable of Pembroke. Pembroke town and castle and its surroundings are linked with the early Christian church. Following the final extension of the castle about 1254 the town was extended and defensive perimeter walls erected around the edge of the town. The walls survive on their medieval foundations, although much rebuilt over the centuries. A great many of the town&#x27;s original medieval burgage plots survive and are divided by early stone walls that are of significant national importance.

Monkton Priory, sited on a hill across the river from the castle, founded in 1098 by Arnulf de Montgomery and granted by him to the Benedictine order, has very early foundations and retains much of the Norman walls of the nave. The choir and sanctuary were renovated in the nineteenth century. Monkton Hall, close by the Priory church, is regarded as the oldest domestic building in Pembrokeshire and possibly Wales and is thought to have been the guesthouse for visitors to the Priory.

The first stone building in the town was a defensive tower, now known as the Medieval Chapel, at 69a Main Street and built on a cliff edge. There are the remains of a great hall to the north and recently filled-in arched cellars. The building was thought to have been later used as an early church as the layout is the same as St. Govan&#x27;s Chapel and was used by John Wesley in 1764 to preach Methodism. In 1866 it became the brewery for the York Tavern which was briefly Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s headquarters at the end of the Siege of Pembroke during the English Civil War.

The town&#x27;s main bridge across the River Pembroke, which also acts as a dam, crosses and constrains the millpond. The first bridge was constructed to house a tide mill, originally granted to the Knight&#x27;s Templar in 1199. The last mill building was destroyed by fire in 1956.

On both banks of the Pembroke River to the west of the castle are many remains of early activities. The North Shore Quarries are relatively complete as are the remains of medieval and Elizabethan slipways where wooden vessels were built before the industrial dockyard and admiralty town was built on the grid pattern of Pembroke Dock. There is a very early complete graving dock in what was Hancock&#x27;s Yard.

During the English Civil War, the strategic maritime shire was primarily in the control of the parliamentary forces which aspired to prevent communication to Ireland.

At Pennar Flats there was an early submarine base used for experiments in submarine warfare. Three of the houses on the then foreshore, part of the shipyard before the Admiralty Dock Yard was built, are still standing but are heavily altered.

The ferry port of Pembroke Dock is to the northwest of Pembroke. It was established in 1814.

== Geography ==
Pembroke town stands on the South Pembrokeshire limestone peninsula by the estuary of the River Cleddau, flanked on all sides by woodland and arable farmland. The town is south of the county town of Haverfordwest.

The town is centred on Main Street, which is the only street that is inside the original Pembroke town walls. Outside the walls, residential estates have been built to the north towards Pembroke Dock, to the east towards Lamphey, and to the south. To the west of the town lies the village of Monkton, which is included as part of the community of Pembroke. At the 2001 census, the community had a population of 7,214.

The conurbation of Pembroke Dock and Pembroke has a combined population of 15,890 and as such is one of the major population centres of West Wales.

==Governance==
===Local government===
There are two tiers of local government covering Pembroke, at community (town) and county level: Pembroke Town Council and Pembrokeshire County Council. Pembroke Town Council is based at Pembroke Town Hall. The community of Pembroke covers an area of and includes the Pembroke St Mary North, St Mary South, St Michael and Monkton wards.

For representation on the county council, the four wards comprising Pembroke community each elect one councillor.

===Senedd and Westminster representation===
Pembroke is part of the Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire Senedd constituency and the Mid and South Pembrokeshire UK Parliamentary constituency.

The local Member of Parliament (MP) is Henry Tufnell, a member of the Labour Party.

===Administrative history===
Pembroke was an ancient borough, with evidence of borough charters dating back to at least 1168. The borough covered the two parishes of Pembroke St Mary and Pembroke St Michael plus part of the parish of Monkton (also known as Pembroke St Nicholas). The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836. The borough included a sizeable rural area within its boundaries as well as the built up area of Pembroke itself. The town of Pembroke Dock, which developed from the early nineteenth century as a separate urban area was nevertheless within the borough boundaries of Pembroke, falling within the parish of Pembroke St Mary. The part of the parish of Monkton outside the borough boundaries became a separate parish called Hundleton in 1894.

As Pembroke Dock grew through the nineteenth century it began to rival the old town of Pembroke for position as the main settlement within the borough. By 1895 Pembroke Borough Council had adopted the practice of holding its meetings alternately at Pembroke Town Hall and at Pembroke Dock, where the council had established its main administrative offices at 37 Bush Street (renumbered 71 Bush Street in 1906). The council remained based at 71 Bush Street (and later also expanded into neighbouring 73 Bush Street) until the early 1970s when it acquired Llanion Park, part of the Llanion Barracks at Pembroke Dock, to serve as its headquarters.

Pembroke Borough Council was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, with the area becoming part of the new district of South Pembrokeshire within the county of Dyfed on 1 April 1974. A community was established to cover the area of the former borough, with its council taking the name Pembroke Town Council. South Pembrokeshire District Council took over Llanion Park at Pembroke Dock to serve as its headquarters.

On 1 April 1986 the community of Pembroke was split into a Pembroke Dock community and a reduced Pembroke community, with Pembroke Town Council thereafter just covering the old town of Pembroke itself.

South Pembrokeshire was abolished in 1996, with the area becoming part of a re-established Pembrokeshire.

==Education==
Primary and pre-school (ages 3–11) education in Pembroke is served by three state schools. In Pembroke town, Golden Grove CP School is an English-medium school established in 2002 as a dual stream school following the amalgamation of Golden Manor Infants School and Grove Junior School. Since 2024, Welsh-medium primary education has been provided by Ysgol Bro Penfro. In Monkton, pupils can attend Monkton Priory CP School.

Secondary education is provided by Henry Tudor School (in Welsh: &quot;Ysgol Harri Tudur&quot;), a mixed 11–18 comprehensive school of 1,600 pupils with a sixth form of about 200. The school was formed in 1972 as a result of the amalgamation of the former grammar school and secondary modern school. Previously known as Pembroke School, it adopted its current name in September 2018 following the construction of new buildings on the same site and the demolition of the original buildings. The school takes pupils from the Pembroke family of schools, which as well as Golden Grove and Monkton Priory includes community primary schools in Lamphey, Orielton, Pennar and Pembroke Dock, voluntary controlled primary schools in Angle, Cosheston and Stackpole, and St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary School in Pembroke Dock.

==Culture and community==

Pembroke 21C community association was founded in 2004, and is based out of the Foundry House building on the Commons, which they operate as a community centre. Activities carried out by 21C include organising the annual Pembroke Festival, running the town&#x27;s fortnightly farmers&#x27; market and producing a quarterly newsletter which is distributed to all households in the town. Pembroke Rugby Club organises the town&#x27;s annual carnival, which is usually held in June. Pembroke Library shares a building with the Tourist Information Centre on Commons Road and offers a full lending service and internet access.

Pembroke has been twinned with the towns of Bergen, Lower Saxony, Germany, since 1977 and Pembroke, Malta, since 2002.

== Sport ==
Pembroke Rugby Club is on Upper Lamphey Road. The ground is called Crickmarren. The club plays in WRU Division Five West. Pembroke&#x27;s main game of the season is often the local derby with rivals the Pembroke Dock Harlequins. Pembroke produced Ospreys and Welsh international Jonathan Thomas, Welsh international Dominic Day and Scotland international Luke Hamilton.

Other sporting clubs in the area include the football team Monkton Swifts.

The town is home to Pembroke Cricket Club. The cricket club plays its home games at its Treleet ground on Upper Lamphey Road, opposite the rugby club. The club currently has a 1st and a 2nd team playing in divisions 2 and 4 of the Pembrokeshire league. The club colours are green and gold.

== Broadband blackspot ==
, it was revealed that Pembroke was the UK&#x27;s second-slowest broadband town. The average internet download speed in Pembroke was just over 1.6 Mbit/s (1600 kbit/s) compared to the UK average of 12.0 Mbit/s (12000 kbit/s) at the time.

BT&#x27;s telephone exchange, which serves Pembroke and Pembroke Dock, was upgraded in 2014 under the Superfast Cymru programme and new cabinets were built to provide fiber-to-the-cabinet technology. Additional exchanges across Pembrokeshire are also being upgraded under the programme, with a goal of bringing superfast broadband to 96% of Wales by spring 2016. In 2022, alternative network provider Ogi announced plans to rollout fiber-to-the-premises technology in Pembroke allowing households access to broadbands speeds up to 1 Gbit/s (1000 Mbit/s).

<doc id="250640" wikidata="Q244628" url="?curid=250640" title="Prachuap Khiri Khan province">
<text>Prachuap Khiri Khan (, ) is one of the western provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand. It is in the northern part of the Malay Peninsula, some south of Bangkok. Neighboring provinces include Phetchaburi to the north and Chumphon to the south. To the west, it borders Tanintharyi Region of Myanmar.

==Geography==
Prachuap Khiri Khan covers an area totaling . The province is on the Kra Isthmus, the narrow land bridge connecting the Malay Peninsula with mainland Asia. The province has one of the narrowest parts of Thailand, just from the Gulf of Thailand to the border with Myanmar in the Tenasserim Hills. Geographically, Prachuap Khiri Khan is a moderate plain with elevations varying from sea level to . The maximum elevations are found in the northeastern and central west regions, which make up approximately 30 percent of the province. The total forest area is or 38.7 percent of provincial area.

The long coast of the Gulf of Thailand has many sandy beaches. One of the best known, Hua Hin, has been a popular resort town since King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) built a summer palace there. From the coast the land quickly rises into the Tenasserim Hills, the mountain chain that forms the border with Myanmar. Due to its narrow watershed, the rivers in the province are all small. The only one of significance is the Pranburi River in the north. Among the smaller rivers is the Khlong Kui.

Prachuap Khiri Khan has a dubbed as &quot;Mueang Sam Ao&quot;, which meaning &quot;city of three bays&quot;, refers to Ao Noi, Ao Prachup, and Ao Manao all three bays are lined up and are located in the area of Mueang Prachuap Khiri Khan District.

Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park was established in 1966 to protect Thailand&#x27;s largest freshwater marshes. The park contains some mangrove forests and mudflats. Most of the marshes were converted into shrimp farms, despite being in a national park. There are a total of six national parks, make up region 3 (Phetchaburi branch) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.

==History==

The city of Muang Na Rang was reconstructed after it had been abandoned during the fall of the Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1767. The town was rebuilt at the mouth of the Ron River and renamed &quot;Prachuap Khiri Khan&quot; in 1855, which means &#x27;city in the mountains&#x27;.

King Mongkut gathered the people of three towns—Bang Nangrom, Kui Buri, and Khlong Wan—and resettled them in the rebuilt city. At the same time, he renamed a portion of what is now Trat province and Koh Kong province in Cambodia &quot;Patchan Khiri Khet&quot;. The name was chosen to rhyme with &quot;Prachuap Khiri Khan&quot; on the opposite side of the Gulf of Thailand at the same latitude.

In 1868, King Mongkut invited foreign guests to Prachuap Khiri Khan to watch a solar eclipse he had predicted for 18 August. The dignitaries viewed it from an observation point in the marshes near Sam Roi Yot. He contracted malaria, of which he died on 1 October.

In the reign of King Rama II, a new city was established at the mouth of the I Rom Canal known as Muang Bang Nang Rom. Prachuap became a seaside resort during the reign of King Rama V. Besides tourism, the province is heavily agricultural. Coconuts are a major crop. As much as 40 percent of farmers in Prachuap Khiri Khan solely cultivate coconuts.

At the beginning of World War II, Japanese troops invaded Thailand. On 8 December 1941, they struck first near the city of Prachuap Khiri Khan. After resisting the Japanese in the Battle of Prachuap Khiri Khan, after several hours the defenders were ordered to cease fire by the government in Bangkok.

===Archaeology===
The discovery of 3,000 years old cave paintings was announced by archaeologists from the Fine Arts Office in a cave at the Khao Sam Roi Yod National Park in May 2020. Some of the depicted pictures are still visible and clear, while some paintings were damaged by limestone etching. According to archeologist Kannika Premjai, paintings describe humanlike figures with accessories on their bodies, hunting scenes with bow and arrow. Moreover, there is also an animal figure seems to be serow (a goat-like mammal found regionally) found among the drawings.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows the Kuha Karuhas Pavilion, which was built when King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) visited the Praya Nakorn Cave (Sam Roi Yot District). Depicted behind the pavilion is the island of Ko Lak in Prachuap Bay, the historic center of administration.

The provincial tree as well as the provincial flower is the &quot;rayan&quot; or &quot;manilkara&quot; (&quot;Manilkara hexandra&quot;). Milkfish (&quot;Chanos chanos&quot;) is the provincial fish.

The provincial slogan is &#x27;City of pure gold, delectable coconuts and pineapples, delightful beaches, mountain and caves, land of spiritual beauty&#x27;.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into eight districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). The districts are further divided into 48 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 388 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Prachuap Khiri Khan Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 16 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Prachuap Khiri khan and Hua Hin have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 14 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 44 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.


==Tourism==

Thailand&#x27;s royal family and especially former kings were the first to set this location on the map as the original seashore destination in Thailand. The long white sandy beaches themselves are clean and pretty. Besides sunbathing snorkeling and swimming, visitors can also enjoy golf, spas, caves, peaks, waterfalls, shops, and nearby national parks.

<text>A librarian is a person who professionally works managing information. Librarians&#x27; common activities include providing access to information, conducting research, creating and managing information systems, creating, leading, and evaluating educational programs, and providing instruction on information literacy to users.

The role of the librarian has changed over time, with the past century in particular bringing many new media and technologies into play. From the earliest libraries in the ancient world to the modern information hub, there have been keepers and disseminators of the information held in data stores. Roles and responsibilities vary widely depending on the type of library, the specialty of the librarian, and the functions needed to maintain collections and make them available to its users.

Education for librarianship has changed over time to reflect changing roles.

==History==

===The ancient world===
The Sumerians were the first to train clerks to keep records of accounts. &quot;Masters of the books&quot; or &quot;keepers of the tablets&quot; were scribes or priests who were trained to handle the vast amount and complexity of these records. The extent of their specific duties is unknown.
Sometime in the 8th century BC, Ashurbanipal, King of Assyria, created a library at his palace in Nineveh in Mesopotamia. Ashurbanipal was the first individual in history to introduce librarianship as a profession. We know of at least one &quot;keeper of the books&quot; who was employed to oversee the thousands of tablets on Sumerian and Babylonian materials, including literary texts; history; omens; astronomical calculations; mathematical tables; grammatical and linguistic tables; dictionaries; and commercial records and laws. All of these tablets were cataloged and arranged in logical order by subject or type, each having an identification tag.

The Great Library of Alexandria, created by Ptolemy I after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, was created to house the entirety of Greek literature. It was notable for its famous librarians: Demetrius, Zenodotus, Eratosthenes, Apollonius, Aristophanes, Aristarchus, and Callimachus. These scholars contributed significantly to the collection and cataloging of the wide variety of scrolls in the library&#x27;s collection. Most notably, Callimachus created what is considered to be the first subject catalog of the library holdings, called the pinakes. The pinakes contained 120 scrolls arranged into ten subject classes; each class was then subdivided, listing authors alphabetically by titles. The librarians at Alexandria were considered the &quot;custodians of learning&quot;.

Near the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire, it was common for Roman aristocrats to hold private libraries in their home. Many of these aristocrats, such as Cicero, kept the contents of their private libraries to themselves, only boasting of the enormity of his collection. Others, such as Lucullus, took on the role of lending librarian by sharing scrolls in their collection. Many Roman emperors included public libraries into their political propaganda to win favor from citizens. While scholars were employed in librarian roles in the various emperors&#x27; libraries, there was no specific office or role that qualified an individual to be a librarian. For example, Pompeius Macer, the first librarian of Augustus&#x27; library, was a praetor, an office that combined both military and judicial duties. A later librarian of the same library was Gaius Julius Hyginus, a grammarian.

===Middle Ages and Renaissance===

Christian monasteries in Europe are credited with keeping the institution of libraries alive after the fall of the Roman Empire. It is during this time that the first codex (book as opposed to scroll) enters popularity: the parchment codex. Within the monasteries, the role of librarian was often filled by an overseer of the scriptorium where monks would copy out books cover to cover. A monk named Anastasias who took on the title of (literally &quot;librarian&quot;) following his successful translations of the Greek classicists. During this period, the lectern system, in which books were chained to desks for security, was also introduced. Classification and organization of books during this period was generally done by subject and alphabetically, with materials inventoried using basic check lists. Later in the period, individuals known as (singular ) began more formal cataloguing, inventory, and classification.

In the 14th century, universities began to reemerge which had libraries and employed librarians. At the same time royalty, nobles and jurists began to establish libraries of their own as status symbols. King Charles V of France began his own library, and he kept his collection as a , an attribute that is closely connected to librarians of this time.

The Renaissance is considered to be a time of aristocratic enthusiasm for libraries. During this period, great private libraries were developed in Europe by figures such as Petrarch and Boccaccio. These libraries were sponsored by popes, royals, and nobility who sent agents throughout Western Europe to locate manuscripts in deteriorating monastic libraries. As a result, Renaissance libraries were filled with a wealth of texts. While materials in these libraries were mostly restricted, the libraries were open to the public. Librarians were needed to plan and organize libraries to meet public needs. A tool to achieve these organizational goals, the first library catalog, appeared in 1595.

===Enlightenment era===
During the 16th century, the idea of creating a , a universal listing of all printed books, emerged from well-established academics and librarians: Conrad Gessner, Gabriel Naudé, John Dury, and Gottfried Leibniz. The four librarians responsible for establishing the &quot;Bibliotheca Universalis&quot; are important figures in librarianship. Gabriel Naudé published , the first printed monograph on librarianship. In this monograph, Naudé advocated collecting all kinds of books, old and new, of famous, more obscure, and heretical authors. He also contributed to the idea of organization and administration of libraries which led to the development of library collections. It was also in part thanks to Naudé that some libraries began to lend books outside of the precincts of the library.

John Dury is considered to be the first English library theorist. He wrote two letters to Samuel Hartlib concerning the duties of a professional librarian, which were published in 1650 as &quot;The Reformed Librarie-Keeper&quot;. He held that librarians should not only care for the books, but should also be well educated and accomplished to raise the standards of librarianship. Furthermore, he advocated that librarians deserve a living wage in order to use their energy to perform their duties to the fullest extent. Gottfried Leibniz upheld that the librarian was the most important factor in the aid of learning. He is credited as including science texts in addition to conventional literature within library collections.

Another key figure of this time, Sir Thomas Bodley, gave up his career as a diplomat and established Oxford&#x27;s Bodleian library. He is credited as creating the first functional library of modern times. Subsequent librarians following Bodley were called , Bodley&#x27;s Librarian. They would earn £40 a year. The ideas formed with these librarians continued to develop into the 17th century. With the approach of , libraries changed; the content of libraries became less selective, to include literature of entertainment as well as academic value. At this time, libraries also became fully open to the public, with access no longer restricted to a small circle of readers.

In 18th-century France, two librarians, Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon and Joseph Van Praet, selected and identified over 300,000 books and manuscripts that became the property of the people in the . During the French Revolution, librarians assumed sole responsibility for selecting books for use by all citizens of the nation. Out of this action came the implementation of the concept of modern library service: the democratic extension of library services to the general public, regardless of wealth or education.

===Modern era===
While there were full-time librarians in the 18th century, the professionalization of the library role was a 19th-century development, as shown by its first training school, its first university school, and its first professional associations and licensing procedures. 

In England in the 1870s, a new employment role opened for women in libraries; it was said that the tasks were &quot;Eminently Suited to Girls and Women.&quot; By 1920, women and men were equally numerous in the library profession, but women pulled ahead by 1930 and comprised 80% by 1960. The factors accounting for the transition included the demographic losses of the First World War, the provisions of the Public Libraries Act of 1919, the library-building activity of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, and the library employment advocacy of the Central Bureau for the Employment of Women. In the United Kingdom, evidence suggests that the Conservative government began replacing professional librarians with unpaid volunteers in 2015–2016.

=== COVID-19 pandemic in the US ===

During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in 2020, many librarians were temporarily displaced as libraries across the country were affected by a nationwide shutdown in efforts to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 disease. During this time, library services were in high demand as patrons were stuck inside during quarantine, but with limited building access, most public library patrons switched to digital content, online learning, and virtual programs.

As the crisis escalated, there was a high demand for contact tracers, and the CDC had earlier named librarians as key public health staff to support COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing, so many librarians and library staff volunteered to help with contact tracing. Librarians also supported their community in other ways, such as staffing non-emergency hotlines and manning shelters for the homeless, for which they were able to retain their income, while others were furloughed for a time.

The Librarian Reserve Corps was formed during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was a global network of volunteer librarians, specializing in academic libraries and medical libraries, serving as &quot;information first responders&quot; in the fight against the Infodemic as a direct result of COVID-19 pandemic. The Librarian Reserve Corps Literature Enhancement and Metadata Enrichment (LIME) volunteers, led by Jessica Callaway, vetted, indexed, and helped disseminate resources about COVID-19 to various organizations, including the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and the World Health Organization. As of November 2021, the Librarian Reserve Corps has vetted over 60,000 publications relating to COVID-19. The Librarian Reserve Corps founder, Elaine Hicks, and co-leadership Stacy Brody and Sara Loree, were awarded the 2021 Librarian of the Year title from Library Journal.

==Roles and responsibilities==

Traditionally, a librarian is associated with collections of books, as demonstrated by the etymology of the word &quot;librarian&quot; (from the Latin &quot;liber&quot;, &quot;book&quot;). A 1713 definition of the word was &quot;custodian of a library&quot;, while in the 17th century, the role was referred to as a &quot;library-keeper&quot;, and a librarian was a &quot;scribe, one who copies books&quot;.

The role of a librarian is continually evolving to meet social and technological needs. A modern librarian may deal with provision and maintenance of information in many formats, including books; electronic resources; magazines; newspapers; audio and video recordings; maps; manuscripts; photographs and other graphic material; bibliographic databases; and Internet-based and digital resources. A librarian may also provide other information services, such as information literacy instruction; computer provision and training; coordination with community groups to host public programs; assistive technology for people with disabilities; and assistance locating community resources.

The Internet has had a profound impact on the resources and services that librarians of all kinds provide to their patrons. Electronic information has transformed the roles and responsibilities of librarians, even to the point of revolutionizing library education and service expectations.

===Positions and duties=== 
Specific duties vary depending on the size and type of library. Olivia Crosby described librarians as &quot;Information experts in the information age.&quot; Most librarians spend their time working in one of the following areas of a library: Archivists can be specialized librarians who deal with archival materials, such as manuscripts, documents and records, though this varies from country to country, and there are other routes to the archival profession.

Collection development or acquisitions librarians monitor the selection of books and electronic resources. Large libraries often use approval plans, which involve the librarian for a specific subject creating a profile that allows publishers to send relevant books to the library without any additional vetting. Librarians can then see those books when they arrive and decide if they will become part of the collection or not. All collections librarians also have a certain amount of funding to allow them to purchase books and materials that don&#x27;t arrive via approval.

Electronic resources librarians manage the databases that libraries license from third-party vendors. School librarians work in school libraries and perform duties as teachers, information technology specialists, and advocates for literacy. Instruction librarians teach information literacy skills in face-to-face classes or through the creation of online learning objects. They instruct library users on how to find, evaluate, and use information effectively. They are most common in academic libraries.

Media specialists teach students to find and analyze information, purchase books and other resources for the school library, supervise library assistants, and are responsible for all aspects of running the library/media center. Both library media teachers (LMTs) and young adult public librarians order books and other materials that will interest their young adult patrons. They also must help YAs find relevant and authoritative Internet resources. Helping this age group to become lifelong learners and readers is a main objective of professionals in this library specialty.

Outreach librarians are charged with providing library and information services for underrepresented groups, such as people with disabilities, low-income neighborhoods, home bound adults and seniors, incarcerated and ex-offenders, and homeless and rural communities. In academic libraries, outreach librarians might focus on high school students, transfer students, first-generation college students, and minorities.

Public service librarians work with the public, frequently at the reference desk of lending libraries. Some specialize in serving adults or children. Children&#x27;s librarians provide appropriate material for children at all age levels, include pre-readers, conduct specialized programs and work with the children (and often their parents) to help foster interest and competence in the young reader. (In larger libraries, some specialize in teen services, periodicals, or other special collections.)

Reference or research librarians help people doing research to find the information they need, through a structured conversation called a reference interview. The help may take the form of research on a specific question, providing direction on the use of databases and other electronic information resources; obtaining specialized materials from other sources; or providing access to and care of delicate or expensive materials. These services are sometimes provided by other library staff that have been given a certain amount of special training; some have criticized this trend.

Systems librarians develop, troubleshoot and maintain library systems, including the library catalog and related systems. Technical service librarians work &quot;behind the scenes&quot; ordering library materials and database subscriptions, computers and other equipment, and supervise the cataloging and physical processing of new materials. A Youth Services librarian, or children&#x27;s librarian, is in charge of serving young patrons from infancy all the way to young adulthood. Their duties vary, from planning summer reading programs to weekly story hour programs. They are multitaskers, as the children&#x27;s section of a library may act as its own separate library within the same building. Children&#x27;s librarians must be knowledgeable of popular books for school-aged children and other library items, such as e-books and audiobooks. They are charged with the task of creating a safe and fun learning environment outside of school and the home.

A young adult or YA librarian specifically serves patrons who are between 12 and 18 years old. Young adults are those patrons that look to library services to give them direction and guidance toward recreation, education, and emancipation. A young adult librarian could work in several different institutions; one might be a school library/media teacher, a member of a public library team, or a librarian in a penal institution. Licensing for library/media teacher includes a Bachelor or Master of Arts in Teaching and additional higher-level course work in library science. YA librarians who work in public libraries are expected to have a master&#x27;s degree in Library and Information Science (MLIS), relevant work experience, or a related credential.

===Additional responsibilities===

Experienced librarians may take administrative positions such as library or information center director or learning resource officer. Similar to the management of any other organization, they are concerned with the long-term planning of the library, and its relationship with its parent organization (the city or county for a public library, the college/university for an academic library, or the organization served by a special library). In smaller or specialized libraries, librarians typically perform a wide range of the different duties.

Representative examples of librarian responsibilities:
*Researching topics of interest for their constituencies.
*Referring patrons to other community organizations and government offices.
*Suggesting appropriate books (&quot;readers&#x27; advisory&quot;) for children of different reading levels and recommending novels for recreational reading.
*Reviewing books and journal databases
*Working with other education organisations to establish continual, lifelong learning and further education initiatives
*Facilitating and promoting reading clubs.
*Developing programs for library users of all ages and backgrounds.
*Managing access to electronic information resources.
*Assessing library services and collections in order to best meet library users&#x27; needs.
*Building and maintaining collections to respond to changing community needs or demands
*Creating pathfinders
*Writing grants to gain funding for expanded program or collections
*Digitizing collections for online access
*Publishing articles in library science journals 
*Answering incoming reference questions via telephone, postal mail, email, fax, and chat
*Delivering arts and cultural activities to local communities
*Initiating and establishing creative digital activities to introduce children to coding, engineering and website building
*Marking promotion and advocacy of library services 
* Assisting job seekers and local businesses
*Making and enforcing computer appointments on the public access Internet computers.

=== Librarians and work-related stress ===
As user and community needs change over time, the role of the librarian continues to reflect these changes. Librarians assist and interact with vulnerable or at-risk populations regularly. It is proposed that librarians experience a moderate degree of work-related stress, and is reported that many experience harassment or emotionally challenging situations in their daily work. The public library in particular can often be described as having an emotionally charged atmosphere. There is evidence to suggest that specialized librarians might experience similar conditions. For example, health science librarians report experiencing a mild to moderate amount of secondary traumatic stress that develops from working closely with patients who are experiencing trauma.

== Changing roles of librarians ==
There are a number of contributing factors to the librarians’ roles changing. 

* Development in information technology

* Changing economy

* Changing educational and learning environment

* Changes in scholarly communication.

== Workplaces ==

Basic categories of workplace settings for librarians are routinely classified around the world as: public, academic, school, and special. Some librarians will start and operate their own business. They often call themselves information brokers, research specialists, knowledge management, competitive intelligence, or independent information professionals. Below are the basic differences between the types of libraries.

===Public library===
Public libraries are created through legislation within the jurisdiction they serve. Accordingly, they are given certain benefits, such as taxpayer funding, but must adhere to service standards and meet a wide group of client needs. They are usually overseen by a board of directors or library commission from the community. Mission statements, service and collection policies are the fundamental administrative features of public libraries. Occasionally, private lending libraries serve the public in the manner of public libraries. In the United States, public librarians and public libraries are represented by the Public Library Association. Public library staffing is structured in response to community needs. Libraries bridge traditional divisions between technical and public services positions by adopting new technologies such as mobile library services and reconfigure organizations depending on the local situation.

===Academic library===

An academic library is a library that is an integral part of a college, university, or other institution of postsecondary education, administered to meet the information and research needs of its students, faculty, and staff. In the United States, the professional association for academic libraries and librarians is the Association of College and Research Libraries. Depending upon the institution, the library may serve a particular faculty or the entire institution. Many different types, sizes, and collections are found in academic libraries and some academic librarians are specialists in these collections and archives. A university librarian, or chief librarian, is responsible for the library within the college structure, and may also be called the Dean of Libraries or Director of Libraries. Some post-secondary institutions treat librarians as faculty, and they may be called professor or other academic ranks, which may or may not increase their salary and benefits. Some universities make similar demands of academic librarians for research and professional service as are required of faculty. Academic librarians administer various levels of service and privilege to faculty, students, alumni, and the public.

===School library===
A school library exclusively serves the needs of a public or private school. The primary purpose is to support the students, teachers, and curriculum of the school or school district. In addition to library administration, certificated teacher-librarians instruct individual students, groups and classes, and faculty in effective research methods, often referred to as information literacy skills. Audio-visual equipment service and/or textbook circulation may also be included in a school librarian&#x27;s responsibilities. Often, teacher-librarians are qualified teachers who take academic courses for school library certification or earn a master&#x27;s degree in Library Science.

===Special library===
Special libraries are libraries designed to perform some specific function for a particular set of people or an organization, i.e. news, law, medical, theological, prison, corporate, or museum. They can be highly specialized, serving a discrete user group with a restricted collection area. In an increasingly global and virtual workplace, many special librarians may not even work in a library at all but instead manage and facilitate the use of electronic collections. Funding for special libraries varies widely. Librarians in some types of special libraries may be required to have additional training, such as a law degree for a librarian in an academic law library or appropriate subject degrees for subject specialties such as chemistry, engineering, etc. Many belong to the Special Libraries Association. There are also more specific associations such as the American Association of Law Libraries, Art Libraries Society of North America, the American Theological Library Association, the Medical Library Association, or the Visual Resources Association.

== Education ==

Librarians generally hold a university degree in library science. It is also possible to earn a doctorate in library science. The first doctoral degree in library science was offered by the Graduate Library School, University of Chicago, 1928-1989. Graduates with PhDs usually become teaching faculty in schools of library and information science, or sometimes occupy the directorship or deanship of university libraries. Those undertaking research at the doctoral level can pursue a very wide range of interests including information technology, government information policy, social research into information use among particular segments of society, information in organizations and corporate settings, and the history of books and printing.

It is common in academic and other research libraries to require the librarians to obtain master&#x27;s degrees in some academic subject, sometimes but not necessarily related to their professional responsibilities; in major research libraries, some of the librarians will hold PhD degrees in subject fields. Other advanced degrees often taken in conjunction with a degree in librarianship are law, management, health administration, or public administration. Despite the existence of doctoral programs existing to supplement a master&#x27;s degree, the American Library Association considers a master&#x27;s degree from an ALA accredited or approved program to be the terminal degree in the field.

Library technicians, library assistants, and library associates (not to be confused with academic rank of assistant librarian or associate librarian) may have diplomas but usually do not hold library-related degrees. Occasionally they also hold undergraduate or graduate degrees in other disciplines. These workers, sometimes referred to as para-professionals, perform duties such as database management, library cataloging, ready reference, and serials and monograph processing.

=== Europe ===
In the United Kingdom, a librarian can have a three- or four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree in library science; separate master&#x27;s degrees in librarianship, archive management, and records management are also available. These degrees are accredited by the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals and the Society of Archivists.

In Germany, the first step for an academic librarian is a PhD in a subject field, followed by additional training in librarianship.

=== North America ===
In the United States and Canada, a librarian generally has a one or two-year (more common) master&#x27;s degree in library science from an accredited university. This master&#x27;s degree is obtained following graduation from a bachelor&#x27;s degree program in any discipline. The Library Science master&#x27;s degree is accredited by the American Library Association and can have specializations within fields such as archival studies, records management, information architecture, public librarianship, medical librarianship, law librarianship, special librarianship, academic librarianship, or school (K-12) librarianship. School librarians often are required to have a teaching credential; however, an additional library science degree is not generally required. Many, if not most, academic librarians also have a second, subject-based master&#x27;s degree. This is especially true of librarians working at four-year colleges. Beta Phi Mu, the international honor society for library &amp; information science and information technology, honors faculty for distinguished service to education for librarianship with the annual Beta Phi Mu Award.

=== Oceania ===

In Australia, a professional librarian must meet the requirements set out by the Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA). 

There are three ways in which these requirements can be met: the individual must obtain an ALIA-recognized bachelor&#x27;s degree in library and information studies, complete a first degree in any discipline followed by an ALIA-recognized postgraduate diploma or masters course, or gain an ALIA-recognized library technician qualifications (undertaken at a Technical and Further Education (TAFE) college/institute followed by an ALIA-recognized bachelor&#x27;s degree in library and information studies. 

ALIA is responsible for accreditation of library specific qualifications for both librarians and library technicians. Professional Australian teacher-librarians require slightly different qualifications. In addition to having a degree that meets ALIA&#x27;s accreditation process, teacher librarians must also hold recognized teaching qualifications.

== Technology ==

The increasing role of technology in libraries has a significant impact on the changing roles of librarians. New technologies are dramatically increasing the accessibility of information, and librarians are adapting to the evolving needs of users that emerge from the adoption of these new technologies. Digital librarians have become ubiquitous in the Information Age, so much so that a new word has been coined for such digital curators: &quot;cybrarian&quot;, which is a portmanteau of the prefix &quot;cyber-&quot; (used to denote digital technology) and &quot;librarian&quot;. The term &quot;cybrarian&quot; can be applied to someone who concerns themselves primarily with the role that technology plays in a traditional library setting. The term is also sometimes used for freelance information consultants.

One of the most significant examples of how technology has changed the role of librarians in the last 50 years has been the move from traditional card catalogs to online public access catalogs (OPACs). Librarians had to develop software and the MARC standards for cataloguing records electronically. They had to purchase and run the computers necessary to use the software. They had to teach the public how to use the new technologies and move to more virtual working environments.

The same could be said of other technology developments, from electronic databases (including the Internet), to logistical functions such as bar codes (or in the near future RFID). Many librarians provide virtual reference services (via web-based chat, instant messaging, text messaging, and e-mail), work in digitizing initiatives for works in the public domain, teach information literacy and technology classes to their users, and work on the development of information architectures for improving access and search functionality. These examples illustrate some of the ways in which librarians are using technology to fulfill and expand upon their historical roles.

Librarians must continually adapt to new formats for information, such as electronic journals and e-books, which present both challenges and opportunities in providing access and promoting them to library patrons.

Increasing technological advance has presented the possibility of automating some aspects of traditional libraries. In 2004 a group of researchers in Spain developed the UJI Online Robot. This robot is able to navigate the library, look for the specified book, and upon its discovery, carefully take it from the shelf and deliver it to the user. Because of the robot&#x27;s extremely limited function, its introduction into libraries poses little risk of the employment of librarians, whose duties are not defined by menial tasks such as the retrieval of books. Recently over 100 libraries in the United States have begun adding 3D printers to their collections in an effort to expose the public to cutting-edge technology.

== Professional organizations ==
=== United States ===
The two largest library associations in the United States are the American Library Association (ALA) and the Special Libraries Association. YALSA, The Young Adult Library Services Association, serves Young Adult librarians, and is part of the American Library Association. Many U.S. states have their own library association as well. Librarians may also join such organizations as the Association of College and Research Libraries and the Public Library Association and the Art Libraries Society of North America. The Canadian Library Association serves Canada and there are provincial associations as well, such as the Ontario Library Association. In the United Kingdom, the professional body for Librarians is the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (formerly known as the Library Association). The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) represents the interests of libraries and librarians internationally. (See also the List of Library Associations.) IFLA hosts the annual IFLA World Library and Information Congress.

Recent issues of concern for U.S. libraries include implementation of the Patriot Act and the Children&#x27;s Internet Protection Act. Many librarians around the world share American librarians&#x27; concern over ethical issues surrounding censorship and privacy.

Some librarians join activist organizations like the UK-based Information for Social Change and the North American-based Progressive Librarians Guild. The Progressive Librarians Guild covers the actions of union library workers in its journal and blog, &quot;Union Library Workers&quot;.

Within the American Library Association (ALA), some also join the Social Responsibilities Round Table (SRRT). SRRT came into being amid the social ferment of the 1960s and is often critical of the American Library Association for not living up to its professed ideals. Another important activist organization is the Social Responsibilities Special Interest Section of the American Association of Law Libraries (AALL). These activist organizations are viewed as controversial by some librarians, while others view them as a natural extension and outgrowth of their own deeply held library ethics. Librarians in the United States who as political actors in our times provide examples of a commitment to equality, the right to know or social justice include Peter Chase, George Christian, Janet Nocek, and Barbara Bailey. In the Doe v. Gonzales case, these librarians challenged the constitutionality of the nondisclosure provisions of the National Security Letters issued by the government under the USA Patriot Act in terrorist or other investigations. The four received the Roger Baldwin Medal of Liberty from the American Civil Liberties Union in June 2007.

== Gender and librarianship ==

=== United States ===
Historically, librarianship has offered differing career opportunities for men and women in the United States, where 83 percent of all librarians were women in 2015. That number had fallen to 79 percent in 2018, before going back up to 81 percent in 2019.

Despite women making up most of the workforce, in 2014, women working as full-time librarians reported a median annual salary of $48,589, compared to $52,528 for men. In 2019 the wage gap was still 92 percent of the median annual earnings reported by men. African American women earned just 69.9 cents and Hispanic and Latina women earned 63.8 cents on every dollar earned by a man of any race. Asian women were the only female racial group to earn more than men of all races, but they still only earned 76.7 cents to the dollar reported by Asian men.

Librarianship grew into a female-dominated sphere in the late 19th century due to the lower value of women&#x27;s wages in comparison to men&#x27;s. Since women had greater difficulty finding work than men, they were more likely to work for lower wages, thus making them more appealing to employers. Women, however, have made continuous progress toward equality, a reform called for following advancements of the American Library Association to amplify female representation in the library field, as well as reflected by the rise of second-wave feminism.

Historically, top positions in the library field have largely been held by men. In 1911, Theresa Elmendorf became the first woman elected president of the American Library Association (which had been founded in 1876), serving in that office for just over a year. The highly esteemed position of Librarian of Congress was held entirely by men from its creation in 1802 (two years after the establishment of the Library of Congress) until 2016, when Dr. Carla Hayden was nominated for the position by President Barack Obama. She was confirmed by Congress in July, and assumed office as the 14th Librarian of Congress in September 2016.

Owing to the large number of men in greater positions of power within the library field, women have also been largely left out of standard histories of U.S. librarianship, but Suzanne Hildenbrand&#x27;s scholarly assessment of the work done by women has expanded the historical record. Writers, academics, and journal publications have aimed to develop the scholarship around women in librarianship by shedding light on important female librarians of history, acknowledging and analyzing the viewpoints of specific groups of female and minority librarians, and bringing the pay gaps of the library profession into discussion.

====American Library Association====
The American Library Association&#x27;s Social Responsibilities Round Table Feminist Task Force (FTF) was founded in 1970 by women who wished to address sexism in libraries and librarianship. FTF was the first ALA group to focus on women&#x27;s issues.
The Committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship (COSWL) of the American Library Association, founded in 1976, represents the diversity of women&#x27;s interest within ALA and ensures that the Association considers the rights of the majority (women) in the library field, and promotes and initiates the collection, analysis, dissemination, and coordination of information on the status of women in librarianship. The bibliographic history of women in U.S. librarianship and women librarians developing services for women has been well-documented in the series of publications initially issued by the Social Responsibilities Round Table Task Force on Women and later continued by COSWL.

The Reference and Adult Services Division of the ALA has a discussion group titled &quot;Women&#x27;s Materials and Women Library Users,&quot; formed in the mid-1980s.

The Library Leadership and Management Association Division of the ALA has a discussion group titled &quot;LLAMA Women Administrators Discussion Group,&quot; which exists to provide a forum for discussion of problems of particular concern to women in administrative positions.

The ALA also has the Women &amp; Gender Studies Section (WGSS) of its Division &quot;Association of College &amp; Research Libraries&quot;; this section was formed to discuss, promote, and support women&#x27;s studies collections and services in academic and research libraries.

The ALA Policy Manual states under &quot;B.2.1.15 Access to Library Resources and Services Regardless of Sex, Gender Identity, Gender Expression, or Sexual Orientation (Old Number 53.1.15):&quot; &quot;The American Library Association stringently and unequivocally maintains that libraries and librarians have an obligation to resist efforts that systematically exclude materials dealing with any subject matter, including sex, gender identity or expression, or sexual orientation. The Association also encourages librarians to proactively support the First Amendment rights of all library users, regardless of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression. Adopted 1993, amended 2000, 2004, 2008, 2010.&quot; 

It also states, under &quot;B.2.12 Threats to Library Materials Related to Sex, Gender Identity, or Sexual Orientation&quot;(Old Number 53.12), &quot;The American Library Association supports the inclusion in library collections of materials that reflect the diversity of our society, including those related to sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression. ALA encourages all American Library Association chapters to take active stands against all legislative or other government attempts to proscribe materials related to sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression; and encourages all libraries to acquire and make available materials representative of all the people in our society. Adopted 2005, Amended 2009, 2010.&quot;

==Popular culture==
Stereotypes of librarians in popular culture are frequently negative: librarians are portrayed as puritanical, punitive, unattractive, and timid if female, or timid, unattractive, and effeminate if male. These stereotypes have harmed librarians in the public eye.

== Librarianship for Deaf communities ==
Deaf people at the library have the same needs as every other person visiting the library and often have more difficulty accessing materials and services. Australian librarian Karen McQuigg states that “even ten years ago, when I was involved in a project looking at what public libraries could offer the deaf, it seemed as if the gap between the requirements of this group and what public libraries could offer was too great for public libraries to be able to serve them effectively.”

=== United States ===
The ALA has admitted that disabled people belong to a minority that is often overlooked and under-represented by people in the library, and the Deaf community belongs in this minority group. However, in the last few decades, libraries across the United States have made great strides in the mission of making libraries more accessible to disabilities in general and to the Deaf community specifically.

One of the first activists in the library community working toward accessibility for the Deaf was Alice Hagemeyer. When disabled communities began demanding equality in the 1970s, Hagemeyer decided to go back to school for her master&#x27;s degree in library science. While she was studying there, she realized that there was not very much information about the Deaf community at her library or at the libraries of any of her classmates. She soon became an activist for Deaf awareness at her library, and she became the first “Librarian for the Deaf Community” from any public library in the nation. Hagemeyer also constructed a manual of resources for Deaf people and those associated with them called &quot;The Red Notebook&quot;, which is now online at the website of the Friends of Libraries for Deaf Action. Hagemeyer was one of the first library activists to make strides for the Deaf community.

New guidelines from library organizations such as International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) and the ALA were written in order to help libraries make their information more accessible to people with disabilities, and in some cases, specifically the Deaf community. IFLA&#x27;s &quot;Guidelines for Library Services to Deaf People&quot; is one such set of guidelines, and it was published to inform libraries of the services that should be provided for Deaf patrons. Most of the guidelines pertain to ensuring that Deaf patrons have equal access to all available library services. Other guidelines include training library staff to provide services for the Deaf community, availability of text telephones or TTYs not only to assist patrons with reference questions but also for making outside calls, using the most recent technology in order to communicate more effectively with Deaf patrons, including closed captioning services for any television services, and developing a collection that would interest the members of the Deaf community.

Over the years, library services have begun to evolve in order to accommodate the needs and desires of local Deaf communities. At the Queen Borough Public Library (QBPL) in New York, the staff implemented new and innovative ideas in order to involve the community and library staff with the Deaf people in their community. The QBPL hired a deaf librarian, Lori Stambler-Dunsmore, to train the library staff about Deaf culture, to teach sign language classes for family members and people who are involved with deaf people, and to teach literacy classes for Deaf patrons. In working with the library, Stambler-Dunsmore was able to help the community reach out to its deaf neighbors, and helped other deaf people become more active in their outside community.
=== Deaf libraries ===
The library at Gallaudet University, the only Deaf liberal arts university in the United States, was founded in 1876. The library&#x27;s collection has grown from a small number of reference books to the world&#x27;s largest collection of deaf-related materials with over 234,000 books and thousands of other materials in different formats. The collection is so large that the library had to create a hybrid classification system based on the Dewey Decimal Classification System in order to make cataloging and location within the library much easier for both library staff and users. The library also houses the university&#x27;s archives, which holds some of the oldest deaf-related books and documents in the world.

In Nashville, Tennessee, Sandy Cohen manages the Library Services for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (LSDHH). The program was created in 1979 in response to information accessibility issues for the Deaf in the Nashville area. Originally, the only service provided was the news via a teletypewriter or TTY, but today, the program has expanded to serving the entire state of Tennessee by providing all different types of information and material on deafness, Deaf culture, and information for family members of Deaf people, as well as a historical and reference collection.

<doc id="250643" wikidata="Q542232" url="?curid=250643" title="Alan Hovhaness">
<text>Alan Hovhaness (; born Alan Vaness Chakmakjian; March 8, 1911 – June 21, 2000) was an American composer. He was one of the most prolific 20th-century composers, with his official catalog comprising 67 numbered symphonies (surviving manuscripts indicate over 70) and 434 opus numbers. The true tally is well over 500 surviving works, since many opus numbers comprise two or more distinct works.

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; music critic Richard Buell wrote: &quot;Although he has been stereotyped as a self-consciously Armenian composer (rather as Ernest Bloch is seen as a Jewish composer), his output assimilates the music of many cultures. What may be most American about all of it is the way it turns its materials into a kind of exoticism. The atmosphere is hushed, reverential, mystical, nostalgic.&quot;

==Name==
After his mother&#x27;s death (on October 3, 1930), the composer began to use the surname &quot;Hovaness&quot; in honor of his paternal grandfather, and changed it to &quot;Hovhaness&quot; around 1944. He stated the name change from the original Chakmakjian reflected the desire to simplify his name because &quot;nobody ever pronounced it right&quot;. However, Hovhaness&#x27; daughter Jean Nandi has written in her book &quot;Unconventional Wisdom&quot;, &quot;My father&#x27;s name at the time of my birth was &#x27;Hovaness&#x27;, pronounced with accent on the first syllable. His original name was &#x27;Chakmakjian&#x27;, but in the 1930s he wanted to get rid of the Armenian connection and so changed his name to an Americanized version of his middle name. Some years later, deciding to re-establish his Armenian ties, he changed the spelling to &#x27;Hovhaness&#x27;, accent on the second syllable; this was the name by which he later became quite famous.&quot;

==Early life and education==
He was born as Alan Vaness Chakmakjian () in Somerville, Massachusetts, to Haroutioun Hovanes Chakmakjian (an Armenian chemistry professor at Tufts College who had been born in Adana, Turkey) and Madeleine Scott (an American of Scottish descent who had graduated from Wellesley College). When he was five, his family moved from Somerville to Arlington, Massachusetts. A Hovhaness family neighbor said his mother had insisted on moving from Somerville because of discrimination against Armenians there. 

Hovhaness was interested in music from a very early age. At the age of four, he wrote his first composition, a cantata in the early Italian style inspired by a song of Franz Schubert. His family was concerned about his late-night composing and about the financial future he could possibly have as an artist. He decided for a short time to pursue astronomy, another of his early loves. The fascination of astronomy remained with him through his entire life and composing career, with many works titled after various planets and stars.

Hovhaness&#x27;s parents soon supported their son&#x27;s precocious composing, and set up his first piano lessons with a neighborhood teacher. Hovhaness continued his piano studies with Adelaide Proctor and then Heinrich Gebhard. By age 14 he decided to devote himself to composition. Among his early musical experiences were Baptist hymns and recordings of Gomidas Vartabed, an eminent Armenian composer. He composed two operas during his teenage years which were performed at Arlington High School, and composer Roger Sessions took an interest in his music during this time. Following his graduation from high school in 1929, he studied with Leo Rich Lewis at Tufts and then under Frederick Converse at the New England Conservatory of Music. In 1932, he won the Conservatory&#x27;s Samuel Endicott prize for composition with his &quot;Sunset Symphony&quot; (elsewhere entitled &quot;Sunset Saga&quot;).

In July 1934, Hovhaness traveled with his first wife, Martha Mott Davis, to Finland to meet Jean Sibelius, whose music he had greatly admired since childhood. The two continued to correspond for the next twenty years. In 1935, Hovhaness named his daughter and only child from his first marriage Jean Christina Hovhaness after Jean Christian Sibelius, her godfather and Hovhaness&#x27;s friend for three decades.

===Destruction of early works===
During the 1930s and 1940s, Hovhaness famously destroyed many of his early works. He later claimed that he had burned at least 1,000 different pieces, a process that took at least two weeks; elsewhere he claimed to have destroyed around 500 scores totaling as many as a thousand pages. In an interview with Richard Howard, he stated that the decision was based primarily on Sessions&#x27; criticism of his works of that period, and that he wanted to make a new start in composition.

==Musical career==

===&quot;Armenian Period&quot;===
Hovhaness became interested in Armenian culture and music in 1940 as organist for the St. James Armenian Apostolic Church in Watertown, Massachusetts, remaining in this position for about ten years. In 1942, he won a scholarship at Tanglewood to study in Czech composer Bohuslav Martinů&#x27;s master class. During a seminar in composition, while a recording of Hovhaness&#x27;s first symphony was being played, Aaron Copland talked loudly in Spanish to Latin-American composers in the room; and at the end of the recording Leonard Bernstein went to the piano, played a melodic minor scale and rebuked the work as &quot;cheap ghetto music&quot;. Apparently angered and distraught by this experience, he left Tanglewood early, abandoning his scholarship and again destroying a number of his works in the aftermath of that major disappointment.

The next year he devoted himself to Armenian subject matter, in particular using modes distinctive to Armenian music, and continued in this vein for several years, achieving some renown and the support of other musicians, including radical experimentalist composer John Cage and choreographer Martha Graham, all the while continuing as church organist.

Beginning in the mid-1940s, Hovhaness and two artist friends, Hyman Bloom and Hermon di Giovanno, met frequently to discuss spiritual and musical matters. All three had a strong interest in Indian classical music, and brought many well known Indian musicians to Boston to perform. During this period, Hovhaness learned to play the sitar, studying with amateur Indian musicians living in the Boston area. Around 1942, Bloom introduced Hovhaness to Yenovk Der Hagopian, a fine singer of Armenian and Kurdish troubadour songs, whose singing inspired Hovhaness.

In one of several applications for a Guggenheim fellowship (1940), Hovhaness presented his credo at the time of application:

:I propose to create a heroic, monumental style of composition simple enough to inspire all people, completely free from fads, artificial mannerisms and false sophistications, direct, forceful, sincere, always original but never unnatural. Music must be freed from decadence and stagnation. There has been too much emphasis on small things while the great truths have been overlooked. The superficial must be dispensed with. Music must become virile to express big things. It is not my purpose to supply a few pseudo-intellectual musicians and critics with more food for brilliant argumentation, but rather to inspire all mankind with new heroism and spiritual nobility. This may appear to be sentimental and impossible to some, but it must be remembered that Palestrina, Handel and Beethoven would not consider it either sentimental or impossible. In fact, the worthiest creative art has been motivated consciously or unconsciously by the desire for the regeneration of mankind.

Lou Harrison reviewed a 1945 concert of Hovhaness&#x27; music, which included his 1944 concerto for piano and strings, entitled &quot;Lousadzak&quot;:
:There is almost nothing occurring most of the time but unison melodies and very lengthy drone basses, which is all very Armenian. It is also very modern indeed in its elegant simplicity and adamant modal integrity, being, in effect, as tight and strong in its way as a twelve-tone work of the Austrian type. There is no harmony either, and the brilliance and excitement of parts of the piano concerto were due entirely to vigor of idea. It really takes a sound musicality to invent a succession of stimulating ideas within the bounds of an unaltered mode and without shifting the home-tone.
However, as before, there were also critics:
:The serialists were all there. And so were the Americanists, both Aaron Copland&#x27;s group and Virgil [Thomson]&#x27;s. And here was something that had come out of Boston that none of us had ever heard of and was completely different from either. There was nearly a riot in the foyer [during intermission] — everybody shouting. A real whoop-dee-doo.

&quot;Lousadzak&quot; was Hovhaness&#x27;s first work to make use of an innovative technique he called &quot;spirit murmur&quot;, an early example of aleatoric music inspired by a vision of Hermon di Giovanno. The technique, essentially similar to the 1960s &quot;ad libitum&quot; aleatory of Lutoslawski, involves instruments repeating phrases in uncoordinated fashion, producing a complex &quot;cloud&quot; or &quot;carpet&quot; of sounds.

In the mid-1940s, Hovhaness&#x27; prestige in New York City was helped considerably by members of the immigrant Armenian community who sponsored several high-profile concerts of his music. This organization, the Friends of Armenian Music Committee, was led by Hovhaness&#x27;s friends Dr. Elizabeth A. Gregory, the Armenian American piano/violin duo Maro Ajemian and Anahid Ajemian, and later by Anahid&#x27;s husband, pioneering record producer and subsequent Columbia Records executive George Avakian. Their help led directly to many recordings of Hovhaness&#x27; music appearing in the 1950s on MGM and Mercury records, placing him firmly on the American musical landscape.

In May and June 1946, while staying with an Armenian family, Hovhaness composed &quot;Etchmiadzin&quot;, an opera on an Armenian theme, which was commissioned by a local Armenian church.

===Conservatory years===
In 1948 he joined the faculty of the Boston Conservatory, teaching there until 1951. His students there included the jazz musicians Sam Rivers and Gigi Gryce.

===Relocation to New York City===
In 1951 Hovhaness moved to New York City, where he became a full-time composer. Also that year (starting on August 1), he worked for the Voice of America, first as a script writer for the Armenian section, then as director of music, composer and musical consultant for the Near East and Transcaucasian sections. He eventually lost this job (along with much of the other staff) when Dwight D. Eisenhower succeeded Harry S. Truman as America president in 1953. From this time on, he branched out from Armenian music, adopting styles and material from a wide variety of sources. As documented in 1953 and 1954, he received Guggenheim Fellowships in composition. He wrote the score for the Broadway play &quot;The Flowering Peach&quot; by Clifford Odets in 1954, a ballet for Martha Graham (&quot;Ardent Song&quot;, also in 1954), and two scores for NBC documentaries on India and Southeast Asia (1955 and 1957). Also during the 1950s, he composed for productions at The Living Theatre.

His biggest breakthrough till then came in 1955, when his Symphony No. 2, &quot;Mysterious Mountain&quot;, was premiered by Leopold Stokowski in his debut with the Houston Symphony, although the idea that &quot;Mysterious Mountain&quot; was commissioned for that orchestra is a common misconception. That same year, MGM Records released recordings of a number of his works. Between 1956 and 1958, at the urging of Howard Hanson, an admirer of his music, he taught summer sessions at the Eastman School of Music long presided over by Hanson. One of Hovhaness&#x27;s students there was Dominick Argento, who described him as &quot;by far the most spontaneous and prolific composer I ever knew.&quot;

===Trips to Asia===
From 1959 through 1963 Hovhaness conducted a series of research trips to India, Hawaii, Japan, and South Korea, investigating the ancient traditional musics of these nations, and eventually integrating elements of these into his own compositions. His study of Carnatic music in Madras, India (1959–60), during which he collected over 300 &quot;ragas&quot;, was sponsored by a Fulbright fellowship. While in Madras, he learned to play the &quot;veena&quot; and composed a work for Carnatic orchestra entitled &quot;Nagooran&quot;, inspired by a visit to the &quot;dargah&quot; at Nagore. This composition was performed by the South Indian Orchestra of All India Radio Madras and broadcast on All-India Radio on February 3, 1960. Hovhaness also compiled a large amount of material on Carnatic &quot;ragas&quot; in preparation for a book on the subject, but never completed it.

He then studied Japanese &quot;gagaku&quot; music (learning the wind instruments &quot;hichiriki&quot;, &quot;shō&quot;, and &quot;ryūteki&quot;) in the spring of 1962 with Masatoshi Shamoto in Hawaii, and a Rockefeller Foundation grant allowed him further &quot;gagaku&quot; studies with Masataro Togi in Japan (1962–63). Also while in Japan, he studied and played the &quot;nagauta&quot; (&quot;kabuki&quot;) &quot;shamisen&quot; and the &quot;jōruri&quot; (&quot;bunraku&quot;) &quot;shamisen&quot;. In recognition of the musical styles he studied in Japan, he wrote &quot;Fantasy on Japanese Woodprints&quot;, Op. 211 (1965), a concerto for xylophone and orchestra.

In 1963 he composed his second ballet score for Martha Graham, entitled &quot;Circe&quot;.

He and his then wife then set up a record label devoted to the release of his own works, Poseidon Society. Its first release was in 1963, with around 15 discs following over the next decade. Following their divorce, the wife was granted ownership of the label but then either sold or transferred rights to this catalog to Crystal Records.

In 1965, as part of a US government-sponsored delegation, he visited Russia as well as Soviet-controlled Georgia and Armenia, the only time he visited his paternal ancestral homeland. While there, he donated his handwritten manuscripts of harmonized Armenian liturgical music to the Yeghishe Charents State Museum of Arts and Literature in Yerevan.

In the mid-1960s he spent several summers touring Europe, living and working much of the time in Switzerland.

===World view===
Hovhaness stated in a 1971 interview in &quot;Ararat&quot; magazine:
===Later life===
Hovhaness was inducted into the National Institute of Arts and Letters (1951), and received honorary DMus degrees from the University of Rochester (1958), Bates College (1959) and the Boston Conservatory (1987). He moved to Seattle in the early 1970s, where he lived for the rest of his life. In 1973, he composed his third and final ballet score for Martha Graham: &quot;Myth of a Voyage&quot;, and over the next twenty years (between 1973 and 1992) he produced no fewer than 37 new symphonies.

He created a major work, &quot;The Rubaiyat, A Musical Setting&quot; in 1975, which was for narrator and orchestra and has been twice recorded. Rubaiyat refers to the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, Persian mathematician, astronomer, and poet. The text consisted of a dozen of the English quatrains from the translation by Edward FitzGerald.

Continuing his interest in composing for Asian instruments, in 1981, at the request of Lou Harrison, he composed two works for Indonesian gamelan orchestra which were premiered by the gamelan at Lewis &amp; Clark College, under the direction of Vincent McDermott.

Hovhaness was survived by his sixth wife, the coloratura soprano Hinako Fujihara Hovhaness (1932–2022), who administered the Hovhaness-Fujihara music publishing company, as well as a daughter (from his first wife), harpsichordist Jean Nandi (b. 1935). He died in 2000.

==Archives==
Significant archives of Hovhaness materials, comprising scores, sound recordings, photographs and correspondence are located at several academic centers, including Harvard University, the University of Washington, the Library of Congress (Washington DC), the Armenian Cultural Foundation (Arlington, Massachusetts), and Yerevan’s State Museum of Arts and Literature in Armenia.

<doc id="250649" wikidata="Q4567942" url="?curid=250649" title="Mass media in China">
<text>The mass media in the People&#x27;s Republic of China primarily consists of television, newspapers, radio, and magazines. Since the start of the 21st century, the Internet has also emerged as an important form of mass media and is under the direct supervision and control of the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Media in China is strictly controlled and censored by the CCP, with the main agency that oversees the nation&#x27;s media being the Central Propaganda Department of the CCP. The largest media organizations, including the China Media Group, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, and the Xinhua News Agency, are all controlled by the CCP.

Since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949 and until the 1980s, almost all media outlets in mainland China have been state-run. Privately owned media outlets only began to emerge at the onset of the Chinese economic reform, although state media continue to hold significant market share. All media continues to follow regulations imposed by the Central Propaganda Department of the CCP on subjects considered taboo by the CCP, including but not limited to the legitimacy of the party, pro-democracy movements, human rights in Tibet, the persecution of Uyghur people, pornography, and the banned religious topics, such as the Dalai Lama and Falun Gong. All journalists are required to study Xi Jinping Thought to maintain their press credentials. Hong Kong, which has maintained a separate media ecosystem than mainland China, is also witnessing increasing self-censorship. 

Reporters Without Borders consistently ranks China very poorly on media freedoms in their annual releases of the World Press Freedom Index, labeling the Chinese government as having &quot;the sorry distinction of leading the world in repression of the Internet&quot;. , China ranked 179 out of 180 nations on the World Press Freedom Index.

== History ==
=== Under Mao ===
In both the Yan&#x27;an era of the 1930s and the early 1950s, the CCP encouraged grassroots journalism in the form &quot;worker-peasant correspondents,&quot; an idea originating from the Soviet Union.

During the early period (1966–1968) of the Cultural Revolution, freedom of the press in China was at its peak. Independent political groups could publish broadsheets and handbills, as well as leaders&#x27; speeches and meeting transcripts which would normally have been considered highly classified. During those years, several Red Guard organizations operated independent printing presses to publish newspapers, articles, speeches, and big-character posters.

Mobile film units brought Chinese cinema to the countryside and were crucial to the standardization and popularization of cultural during this period, particularly including revolutionary model operas. During the Cultural Revolution&#x27;s early years, mobile film teams traveled to rural areas with news reels of Mao meeting with Red Guards and Tiananmen Square parades, where they were welcomed ceremoniously. These news reels became known as &quot;hong bao pian&quot; (&quot;red treasure films&quot;), analogous to how the Little Red Books were dubbed &quot;hong bao shu&quot; (&quot;red treasure books&quot;).

=== Reforms and opening up ===
Media controls were most relaxed during the 1980s under paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, until they were tightened in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. Journalists were active participants in the 1989 demonstrations that culminated in the massacre, which made it all but impossible to reconcile the growing desire of mainland Chinese journalists for control over their own profession with the CCP&#x27;s interest in not letting that happen. There have even been occasional acts of open, outright defiance of the CCP, though these acts remain rare.

Media controls were relaxed again under CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin in the late 1990s, but the growing influence of the Internet and its potential to encourage dissent led to heavier regulations again under CCP general secretary Hu Jintao. Non-governmental media outlets that were allowed to operate within China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau, which have separate media regulatory bodies) were no longer required to strictly follow every journalistic guideline set by the CCP.

In 1998, the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT) began the Connecting Every Village with Radio and TV Project, which extended radio and television broadcasting to every village in China.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, the ways in which the CCP operated—especially the introduction of reforms aimed at decentralizing power—spurred a period of greater media autonomy in several ways:

* The growth of &quot;peripheral&quot;—local and some regional—media. This trend decentralized and dampened CCP oversight. In general, the greater the distance is between reporters and media outlets, and Beijing and important provincial capitals, the greater their leeway.
* A shift toward administrative and legal regulation of the media and away from more fluid and personal oversight. CCP efforts to rely on regulations rather than whim to try to control the media—as evidenced by the dozens of directives set forth when the State Press and Publications Administration was created in 1987, and by new regulations in 1990 and 1994—probably were intended to tighten CCP control, making it a matter of law rather than personal relationships. In fact, however, these regulations came at a time when official resources were being stretched more thinly and individual officials were becoming less willing—and less able—to enforce regulations.
* Vicissitudes of media acceptability. Since the early 1990s, the types of media coverage deemed acceptable by the regime have risen sharply. Growing uncertainties about what is permissible and what is out of bounds sometimes work to the media&#x27;s interests. Often, however, these uncertainties encourage greater self-censorship among Chinese journalists and work to the benefit of the CCP&#x27;s media control apparatus.

As state resources have become stretched more thinly, the media have found it far easier than before to print and broadcast material that falls within vaguely defined , though again, this uncertainty can also work to the advantage of the CCP.

In preparation of the 17th National Party Congress in 2007, new restrictions were placed on all sectors of the press, Internet-users, bloggers, website managers, foreign journalist, more than 30 of which have been arrested since the start of the year. In addition, a thousand discussion forums and websites have been shut down, and &quot;a score of dissidents&quot; have been imprisoned since July 2007.

In efforts to stem growing unrest in China, the propaganda chief of the State Council, Hua Qing, announced in the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; that the government was drafting a new press law that would lessen government involvement in the news media. In the editorial, Hu Jintao was said to have visited the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; offices and said that large scale public incidents should be &quot;accurately, objectively and uniformly reported, with no tardiness, deception, incompleteness or distortion&quot;. Reports by Chinese media at the time indicated a gradual release from CCP control. For example, the detention of anti-government petitioners placed in mental institutions was reported in a state newspaper, later criticized in an editorial by the English-language &quot;China Daily&quot;. At the time, scholars and journalists believed that such reports were a small sign of opening up in the media.

=== Under Xi Jinping ===
Since Xi Jinping became in 2012 the CCP general secretary, censorship has been significantly stepped up. During a 2016 visit to Chinese state media, Xi stated that &quot;party-owned media must hold the family name of the party&quot; and that the state media &quot;must embody the party&#x27;s will, safeguard the party&#x27;s authority&quot;. Under Xi, investigative journalism has been driven almost to extinction within China. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, in 2023, China ranks as the &quot;worst jailer of journalists,&quot; with Uyghurs making up almost half of all imprisoned journalists.

In 2018, as part of an overhaul of CCP and government bodies, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) was renamed into the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) with its film, news media and publications being transferred to the Central Propaganda Department. Additionally, the control of China Central Television (CCTV, including its international edition, China Global Television), China National Radio (CNR) and China Radio International (CRI) were transferred to the newly established China Media Group (CMG) under the control of the Central Propaganda Department. The same year, provinces and cities began to establish international communication centers.

In 2019, the All-China Journalists Association updated its code of ethics and mandatory exam requiring journalists to be guided by Xi Jinping Thought. In October 2021, the National Development and Reform Commission published rules restricting private capital in &quot;news-gathering, editing, broadcasting, and distribution.&quot;

In 2020, the Foreign Correspondents&#x27; Club of China stated that China used coronavirus prevention measures, intimidation and visa curbs to limit foreign reporting. According to Radio Free Asia, in December 2022, the National Press and Publication Administration issued a directive stating that in order to obtain credentials as a professional journalist, they must pass a national exam and &quot;...must support the leadership of the Communist Party of China, conscientiously study, publicize and implement Xi Jinping&#x27;s thoughts on the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, resolutely implement the party&#x27;s theory, line, principles and policies, and adhere to the correct political direction and public opinion guidance.&quot;

Domestically, all journalists must study Xi Jinping Thought through the &quot;Xuexi Qiangguo&quot; app in order for them to renew their press credentials. Journalists are instructed to &quot;correctly guide public opinion.&quot;

== Forms of media ==
=== Newspapers and journals ===
During the early period of the Cultural Revolution, the number of newspapers declined while independent publications by mass political organizations grew. Mao encouraged these independent publications. According to China&#x27;s National Bureau of Statistics, the number of newspapers dropped from 343 in 1965, to 49 in 1966, and then to a 20th-century low of 43 in 1967. At the same time, the number of publications by mass organizations such as Red Guards grew to an estimated number as high as 10,000.

The number of newspapers in mainland China has increased from 43—virtually all CCP newspapers—in 1968 to 382 in 1980 and more than 2,200 today. By one official estimate, there are now more than 7,000 magazines and journals in the country. The number of copies of daily and weekly newspapers and magazines in circulation grew fourfold between the mid-1960s and the mid-to-late 1980s, reaching 310 million by 1987.

These figures, moreover, underreport actual circulation, because many publishers use their own distribution networks rather than official dissemination channels and also deliberately understate figures to circumvent taxation. In addition, some 25,000 printing houses and hundreds of individual bookstores produce and sell unofficial material—mostly romance literature and pornography but also political and intellectual journals. China has many newspapers but the front runners are all State-run: the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, &quot;Beijing Daily&quot;, &quot;Guangming Daily&quot; and the &quot;Liberation Daily&quot;. The two primary news agencies in China are Xinhua News Agency and the China News Service. Xinhua was authorized to censor and edit the news of the foreign agencies in 2007. Some saw the power of Xinhua as making the press freedom weak and it allowed Xinhua to control the news market fully.

The diversity in mainland Chinese media is partly because most state media outlets no longer receive heavy subsidies from the government, and are expected to cover their expenses through commercial advertising. State-owned newspapers which are &quot;commercialized&quot; or &quot;market-oriented&quot; (meaning that they rely on advertising revenues and retail sales) also have greater latitude in their content.

Senior executives in local media are appointed by local governments.

=== Talk radio ===
As of 1997 there were over 100 talk radio stations throughout the Shanghai area.

=== Internet ===


China has the largest number of internet users in the world, as of at least 2022. The internet in China is heavily censored with limitations on public access to international media and non-sanctioned Chinese media. The main bodies for internet control are the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, a CCP body established in 2014, and the Cyberspace Administration of China, which is under the Cyberspace Affairs Commission. Additionally, the Ministry of Public Security&#x27;s Cyber Police force is responsible for internal security, regulating online content, and investigation of Internet fraud, scams, pornography, separatism, and extremism.

=== Satellite receivers ===
The administration of satellite receivers falls under the jurisdiction of the National Radio and Television Administration, which stipulates that foreign satellite televisions channels may only be received at high-end hotels and the homes and workplaces of foreigners. Foreign satellite televisions channels may seek approval to broadcast, but must be &quot;friendly toward China.&quot; Foreign television news channels are, in theory, ineligible for distribution in China.

Home satellite dishes are officially illegal. Black market satellite dishes are nonetheless prolific, numbering well into the tens of millions. Chinese authorities engage in regular crackdowns to confiscate and dismantle illicit dishes, expressing concerns both over the potential for copyright infringements and over their ability receive &quot;reactionary propaganda.&quot;

=== CCP internal media ===

Much of the information collected by the Chinese mainstream media is published in neicans (internal, limited circulation reports prepared for the high-ranking government officials), not in the public outlets. He Qinglian documents in &quot;Media Control in China&quot; that there are many grades and types of internal documents [neibu wenjian 内部文件]. Many are restricted to a certain level of official – such as county level, provincial level or down to a certain level of official in a ministry. Some Chinese journalists, including Xinhua correspondents in foreign countries, write for both the mass media and the internal media. The level of classification is tied to the administrative levels of CCP and government in China. The higher the administrative level of the issuing office, generally the more secret the document is. In local government the issuing grades are province [sheng 省], region (or city directly subordinate to a province) [diqu 地区or shengzhixiashi 省直辖市] and county [xian 县]; grades within government organs are ministry [bu 部], bureau [ju 局] and office [chu 处]; in the military corps [jun 军], division [shi 师], and regiment [tuan 团]. The most authoritative documents are drafted by the CCP Central Committee to convey instructions from CCP leaders. Documents with Chinese Communist Party Central Committee Document [Zhonggong Zhongyang Wenjian 中共中央文件] at the top in red letters are the most authoritative.

=== Foreign media and journalists ===
China does not issue licenses to foreign companies to publish magazines or newspapers directly. Instead, it permits numerous &quot;copyright cooperation&quot; (or syndication) agreements between state-owned media entities and foreign partners. In these arrangements, a state-owned company effectively leases its publishing license to a foreign partner like Conde Nast, which then transforms the magazine into a Chinese edition of publications like Vogue, GQ and Rolling Stone that the two entities copublish together. These titles subsequently undergo rigorous regulatory approval in order to get their partnership renewed. In 2006, the General Administration of Press and Publication halted the approval of new foreign magazines on non-science and technology topics. 

In 2012, China banned Al Jazeera English and expelled their foreign staff due to an unfavorable report about forced labor. This was the first time since 1998 that China had expelled a major foreign media organization.

Since 2016, foreign-owned media is not allowed to publish online in China and online sale of foreign media is regulated to prevent content that may “endanger national security or cause social unrest&quot;.

Reporting in China has become more difficult with the Chinese government increasingly interfering in the work of foreign journalists and discouraging Chinese citizens from giving interviews to the foreign press. The Chinese government increasingly uses restrictions and harassment of foreign journalists as a way to punish their home country or the home country of the media organization they report for. Since 2018 none of the 150 correspondents and bureau chiefs surveyed annually by the Foreign Correspondents&#x27; Club of China (FCCC) have reported an improvement in their working conditions.

In 2020, the Chinese government expelled or forced the departure of at least 20 journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists said of the behavior &quot;It&#x27;s very disreputable for China, and it also shows that they have a lot to hide.&quot;

To foreign journalists working in China, the ruling CCP has threatened and punished them by failing to renew their credentials when they criticize the CCP&#x27;s policies and human rights abuses. In March 2020, Chinese officials expelled almost all American journalists from China, accusing them and the US of trying to &quot;impose American values&quot; in China.

In August 2020, China detained Cheng Lei, an Australian journalist working for China Global Television Network, a Chinese state-run English television news channel, amid souring relations with Australia. Following her arrest the only other two Australian journalists in China were placed under exit bans and only managed to leave the country with their families after the Australian authorities interceded on their behalf.

In December 2020, Chinese authorities detained Haze Fan, who works for the Bloomberg News bureau in Beijing, on suspicion of &quot;endangering national security&quot;.

In April 2021, BBC journalist John Sudworth and his family were forced to flee mainland China for the island of Taiwan after personal attacks and disinformation from the Chinese government put them in danger. His wife is a journalist with the Irish RTÉ. The Chinese government had been angered by reporting he did on the internment camps in Xinjiang as well as a larger BBC story about forced labor in Xinjiang&#x27;s cotton industry.

===Citizen journalism===
== Communist Party control ==
The media and communications industry in mainland China is controlled by the Central Propaganda Department of the CCP. The principal mechanism to force media outlets to comply with the CCP&#x27;s requests is the vertically organized &quot;nomenklatura&quot; system of cadre appointments, and includes those in charge of the media industry. The CCP utilizes a wide variety of tools to maintain control over news reporting including &quot;direct ownership, accreditation of journalists, harsh penalties for online criticism, and daily directives to media outlets and websites that guide coverage of breaking news stories.&quot; National Radio and Television Administration oversees the administration of state-owned enterprises involved in the radio and television, reporting directly to the Central Propaganda Department.

The Central Propaganda Department directly controls the China Media Group, which includes the China Central Television (including China Global Television), China National Radio (CNR) and China Radio International (CRI). The department also owns &quot;China Daily&quot;, as well as controlling many other media-related organizations such as the China International Publishing Group. China News Service, another large media outlet, is run by the CCP Central Committee&#x27;s United Front Work Department. Xinhua News Agency is a ministry-level institution directly under the State Council, while &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; is the official newspaper of the CCP Central Committee.

The government uses a variety of approaches to retain some control over the media:
* It requires that newspapers be registered and attached to a government ministry, institute, research facility, labor group, or other State-sanctioned entity. Entrepreneurs cannot establish newspapers or magazines under their own names, although they reportedly have had some success in setting up research institutes and then creating publications attached to those bodies.
* It still occasionally jails or fines journalists for unfavorable reporting.
* It imposes other punishments when it deems that criticism has gone too far. For example, it shut down the magazine &quot;Future and Development&quot; in 1993 for publishing two articles calling for greater democracy in mainland China, and it forced the firing of the &quot;Beijing Youth Daily&quot;″s editor for aggressively covering misdeeds and acts of poor judgment by CCP cadres.
* It continues to make clear that criticism of certain fundamental policies—such as those on PRC sovereignty over territories under Republic of China administration and Tibet and on Hong Kong&#x27;s future in the wake of the transfer of Hong Kong sovereignty on July 1, 1997 —are off limits.
* It has set up numerous official journalists&#x27; associations—the largest is the All-China Journalist Federation, with more than 400,000 members—so that no single entity can develop major autonomous power.
* It holds weekly meetings with top newspaper editors to direct them as to what news items they want focused upon and which stories they want to go unreported. The controversial closure of the &quot;Freezing Point&quot; journal was generally unreported in mainland China due to government orders.
* It has maintained a system of uncertainty surrounding the boundaries of acceptable reporting, encouraging self-censorship. One media researcher has written that &quot;it is the very arbitrariness of this control regime that cows most journalists into more conservative coverage.&quot;

== Provincial and local media ==
Local investigative reporting is sometimes viewed favorably by central authorities because of its use in identifying local problems or administrative missteps. Provincial media generally have greater latitude in investigative reporting in areas other than the province where they are based, as local authorities lack direct leverage.

In June 2024, the 2007 Emergency Response Law was amended, stating that local governments must &quot;guide news media organisations and support them in reporting and control of discussions&quot; regarding reporting on accidents and disasters.

== International operations ==

As of 2012 CCTV and Xinhua had greatly expanded international coverage and operations particularly in Africa.

In 2021, the United Kingdom expelled three Ministry of State Security (MSS) officers who had been posing as journalists with Chinese media agencies.

===Chinese media in Africa===

Already in 1948, the Xinhua News Agency established its first overseas bureau in sub-Saharan Africa. Initially, the Chinese media presence sought to promote Sino-African relations and &quot;played an important role in assisting the government in developing diplomatic relations with newly independent African countries&quot;. Africa-China media relations became more sophisticated when the Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) was founded in 2000. In 2006 during the first FOCAC Summit in Beijing, the Chinese government presented its vision on media cooperation with Africa. Media exchange should &quot;enhance mutual understanding and enable objective and balanced media coverage of each other&quot;. Through FOCAC, the Chinese influence on the African mediasphere has increased. In 2006, China Radio International (CRI) was established in Nairobi followed by the launch of the Chinese state-run CGTN Africa and the establishment of an African edition of &quot;China Daily&quot; in 2012. Additionally, China offers workshops and exchange programs to African journalists to introduce them to Chinese politics, culture, and economy as well as the Chinese media system. China does not only invest in African media outlets and journalists but also their digital infrastructure. The Chinese government grants financial and technical aid to African countries to expand their communications structure.

Scholars argue that through increased media presence and investments, the Chinese government tries to dominate the public sphere in Africa and expand its soft power. Research shows that Chinese news media in Africa portray China-Africa relations in an extremely positive light with little space for criticism. Hence, China tries to shape African narratives in its favor. However, Chinese media influence in Africa is still relatively new and therefore the consequences of Chinese media engagement in Africa remain unclear. Despite China&#x27;s efforts to support the African media infrastructure and promote China-Africa relations, African perceptions of China vary significantly and are complex. In general, a case study of South Africa shows that China is perceived as a powerful trading nation and economic investments result in a positive Chinese image. Yet, South African journalists are critical of Chinese media intervention and concerned about practices of Chinese journalism. Likewise, a study about Uganda reveals that journalists are worried about media cooperation with China because it poses a threat to the Freedom of the press. To conclude, the success of Chinese media influence in Africa depends on whether they can prevail in the African market and control the narrative in their favor.

=== Overseas Chinese media ===
In 2001, the Jamestown Foundation reported that China was buying into Chinese-language media in the U.S., offering free content, and leveraging advertising dollars—all to manipulate coverage. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in 2018 that the China Watch newspaper supplement was being carried by &quot;The Telegraph&quot; along with other newspapers of record such as &quot;The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;Le Figaro&quot;.

=== International communication centers ===
== International rankings ==
, China ranks second-to-last in terms of press freedoms in the world, according to Reporters Without Borders&#x27; World Press Freedom Index. Reporters Without Borders called China &quot;world&#x27;s largest prison for journalists, and its regime conducts a campaign of repression against journalism and the right to information worldwide.&quot;

<text>Knute Nelson (born Knud Evanger; February 2, 1843 – April 28, 1923) was a Norwegian-born American attorney and politician active in Wisconsin and Minnesota. A Republican, he served in state and national positions: he was elected to the Wisconsin and Minnesota legislatures and to the U.S. House of Representatives and the United States Senate from Minnesota, and served as the 12th governor of Minnesota from 1893 to 1895. Having served in the Senate for 28 years, 55 days, he is the longest-serving Senator in Minnesota&#x27;s history.

Nelson is known for promoting the Nelson Act of 1889 to consolidate Minnesota&#x27;s Ojibwe/Chippewa on a reservation in western Minnesota and break up their communal land by allotting it to individual households, with sales of the remainder to anyone, including non-natives. This was similar to the Dawes Act of 1887, which applied to Native American lands in the Indian Territory.

==Early life and education==
Knute Nelson was born out of wedlock in Evanger, near Voss, Norway, to Ingebjørg Haldorsdatter Kvilekval, who named him Knud Evanger. He was baptized by his uncle on their farm of Kvilekval, who recorded his father as Helge Knudsen Styve. This is unconfirmed. Various theories persist about Knud&#x27;s paternity, including one involving Gjest Baardsen, a famous outlaw.

In 1843, Ingebjørg&#x27;s brother Jon Haldorsson sold the farm where she and Knud lived, as he could not make a living, and emigrated to Chicago. Ingebjørg took Knud with her to Bergen, where she worked as a domestic servant. Having borrowed money for the passage, she and six-year-old Knud emigrated to the United States, arriving in Castle Garden in New York City on July 4, 1849. The holiday fireworks made a lasting impression on Knud, who was listed in immigration records as &quot;Knud Helgeson Kvilekval&quot;. Ingebjørg Haldorsdatter claimed to be a widow (a story she stuck to until 1923). She and Knud traveled by the Hudson River to Albany, New York, and then via the Erie Canal to Buffalo.

They continued across the Great Lakes to Chicago. There her brother Jon, now working as a carpenter, took them in. While with him, Ingebjørg worked as a domestic servant and paid off her debt for passage in less than a year. Knud also worked, first as a house servant, then as a paperboy for the &quot;Chicago Free Press,&quot; which gave him an early education, both because he read the paper and because he learned street profanity.
In the fall of 1850, Ingebjørg married Nils Olson Grotland, also from Voss. The family of three moved to Skoponong, a Norwegian settlement in Palmyra, Wisconsin. Knud was given the surname Nelson after his stepfather, which eliminated the stigma of being fatherless.

By then 17 years old, Nelson was street-smart and rebellious, with a proclivity for profanity. He was accepted to the school held by Mary Blackwell Dillon, an Irish immigrant with linguistic talents. Nelson proved himself an apt though undisciplined student; he later recalled being whipped up to three times a day.

Still in his teens, Nelson joined the Democratic Party out of admiration for Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois. The family moved to the Koshkonong Settlement, which by 1850 had more than half of Wisconsin&#x27;s Norwegian population of 5,000. Nils Olson had bad luck with land purchases and became sickly. Nelson picked up most of the work of the farm, but maintained his commitment to education. Olson was not supportive and Nelson often had to scrounge to find money for schoolbooks.

Nelson&#x27;s academic interests led him to enroll in Albion Academy in Albion, Dane County, Wisconsin, in the fall of 1858. The school was founded by the Seventh-day Adventist Church to provide education to children who could not afford private school; Nelson was deemed &quot;very deserving.&quot; To earn his keep he did various jobs around the school.

After two years, Nelson took a job as a country teacher in Pleasant Springs, near Stoughton. Teaching mostly other Norwegian immigrants, he was an agent of Americanization.

==Military service==
Nelson returned to Albion in the spring of 1861, when the American Civil War had started. By then, he had developed his position as a &quot;low-tariff, anti-slavery, pro-Union Democrat,&quot; but was in the minority in a pro-Abraham Lincoln region. In May 1861, he and 18 other Albion students enlisted in a state militia company known as the Black Hawk Rifles of Racine, to fight with the Union Army in the war. Appalled by its debauchery, the young men refused to be sworn into the army under this militia, and eventually succeeded in being transferred to the 4th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment. This was an &quot;all-American&quot; regiment, made up generally of native-born men.

Nelson&#x27;s parents opposed his volunteering, but he saw it as his duty. He sent half his soldier&#x27;s pay to his parents to help retire the debt on the farm. He seems to have enjoyed army life, noting that the food was better than at home. He shared his fellow soldiers&#x27; frustration at not being put into battle soon enough. His unit moved from Racine to Camp Dix near Baltimore, Maryland. From there they moved to combat operations in Louisiana.

On May 27, 1863, after the 4th Wisconsin became a cavalry unit, Nelson was wounded in the Battle of Port Hudson, captured and made a prisoner of war. He was released when the siege ended. He served as an adjutant, was promoted to corporal, and briefly considered applying for a lieutenant&#x27;s commission.

Military service sharpened Nelson&#x27;s identity as an American and his patriotism. He was deeply concerned about what he considered the ambivalent attitude among Norwegian-American Lutheran clergy toward slavery, and thought that too few of his fellow Norwegian Americans from Koshkonong had volunteered. He read the Norwegian translation of Esaias Tegnér&#x27;s &quot;Friðþjófs saga ins frœkna&quot; and found it enthralling. Its unsentimental depiction of character and virtue he found to be a synthesis of his Norwegian heritage and American home.

Within two years after he mustered out, Nelson acquired his United States citizenship. His disdain for the Copperheads contributed to his becoming a Republican after the war.

Nelson returned to Albion and completed his studies as one of the oldest students, graduating at the top of his class. He gave his first campaign speech of record on behalf of Lincoln, and drew praise from the faculty.

Deciding to become a lawyer, Nelson moved to Madison, where he studied law in the office of William F. Vilas, one of the few academically trained attorneys in the area. In the spring of 1867, Judge Philip L. Spooner admitted him to the Wisconsin bar.

Nelson opened his law practice in Madison, where he appealed to the Norwegian immigrant community, advertising in the Norwegian language newspaper &quot;Emigranten&quot;. He also became Madison&#x27;s unofficial representative of the Norwegian community. With Eli A. Spencer&#x27;s help, he successfully ran for Dane County&#x27;s seat in the Wisconsin State Assembly, starting its session on January 8, 1868.

He was reelected to a second term in the Assembly, as he had quickly learned how to get things done in politics. He got involved in a divisive debate about public and parochial schools in Norwegian communities, taking the &quot;liberal&quot; side that promoted public, non-sectarian schools rather than those run by Lutheran clergy. After his second term in the Assembly, Nelson decided not to run for a third.

==Marriage and family==
After being elected the first time, Nelson married Nicholina Jacobsen, originally from Toten, Norway, in 1868. She was five months pregnant by the time of their marriage and, because of Nelson&#x27;s poor relations with local Lutheran clergy, they were married by Justice of the Peace Lars Erdall in a private home.

A national recession limited the couple&#x27;s financial success. While Nelson slept in his office in Madison during his legislative and professional career, Nicholina and the newborn Ida stayed with her family in Koshkonong.

==Minnesota frontier==
Nelson was already interested in moving further west when in 1870 he was invited by Lars K. Aaker to set up a practice in Alexandria, Minnesota, in Douglas County, part of the state&#x27;s &quot;Upper Country.&quot; Nelson was attracted by the possibilities afforded by the opening frontier, especially the prospect of the railroad. After also visiting Fergus Falls, he moved his wife and newborn son Henry to Alexandria in August 1871.

He was admitted to the Minnesota bar in October and set up a legal practice primarily around land cases referred to him by Aaker, the land agent. He also bought a homestead in Alexandria, a claim that was contested but which he won. He also became an accomplished trial lawyer, was elected the Douglas County attorney, and acted as the county attorney for Pope County. As was typically the case at that time, Nelson&#x27;s legal work on land issues got him involved in political issues. He became a champion for the economic development of the Upper Country through the introduction of the railroad.

===Minnesota state senator===
The so-called &quot;Aaker faction&quot; within the Upper County Republican party found in Nelson a capable politician, with connections to the immigrant community, experience in land-office issues, and political background in Wisconsin. He was put forward as a Republican candidate for the Minnesota Senate in 1874, running against banker Francis Bennett Van Hoesen, who was aligned with the Grange movement and state Anti-Monopoly Party. Though Nelson did not get unanimous support from his Norwegian-American constituency, he carried 59% of the vote and four out of five counties in his constituency.

Nelson&#x27;s first challenge in the state senate, whether to reelect Alexander Ramsey to a third term in the United States Senate, was contentious, as it was against Governor Cushman Davis&#x27;s wishes. Nelson was caught between his allegiance to the Douglas County Republicans, who were staunch Davis supporters, and his land office constituency, who favored Ramsey. Nelson voted for Ramsey, the dark-horse candidate William D. Washburn, and finally for the victor, Samuel J. R. McMillan.

Nelson spent more time on the issue of extending the railroad infrastructure into the Upper Country. His constituents elected him in large part to resolve the gridlock that prevented the completion of the railroad extension from St. Cloud west to Alexandria and beyond. The railroad company, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (SP&amp;P), had run out of funds to complete the St. Vincent extension, and the bondholders were unwilling to invest further. The Minnesota legislature agreed on the need for the railroad but were not in a position to pay for its completion.

In 1875, Nelson introduced the Upper Country bill, which gave SP&amp;P added incentives in the form of land to complete the line, but also imposed a deadline after which the rights to build the railroad were forfeited, presumably in favor of Northern Pacific, whose plans would bypass Alexandria. The bill met with controversy from both sides of the issue and was ultimately amended to the point that Nelson first sought to table it and then abstained from voting on it. The bill was enacted and was considered a success in its time, with most of the credit going to Nelson.

It took several years for the various financial and political matters to be sorted out for the railroad, and Nelson played an active role throughout, both as an elected official, attorney, and businessman. He secured rights-of-way for virtually the entire line from Alexandria to Fergus Falls, negotiating with many stakeholders for every tract of land. This proved to be an all-consuming effort for several years, though he ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor of Minnesota in 1879.

In May 1877, three of Nelson&#x27;s five children died during a diphtheria epidemic. The two oldest, Ida and Henry, survived.

In November 1878, the railroad finally reached Alexandria, thanks in large part to Nelson&#x27;s close working relationship with James J. Hill. Several Minnesota towns were founded as a result of these efforts, including Nelson and Ashby.

===National politics===
Nelson was invited to deliver the &quot;oration of the day&quot; at the United States Centennial on July 4, 1876, in Alexandria, exactly 27 years after he had immigrated to the United States. The &quot;unimpassioned&quot; speech sought to reinforce an American identity and made no mention of his Norwegian roots. It coincided with his campaign for U.S. representative from Minnesota&#x27;s third district.

By then, Nelson had developed the strategy of orchestrating a &quot;bottoms-up&quot; campaign in which he would quietly enlist supporters to publicly encourage him to run, while appearing reluctant. His constituency in the Upper Country frontier put him at a disadvantage with respect to the rivaling Twin Cities. After having flexed his political muscle by &quot;bolting&quot; from the campaign for a few weeks, he supported the Republican nomination of Jacob Stewart, a medical doctor from St. Paul, who won the election against Democrat William McNair. This endorsement was not backed by the Norwegian-American community, who were concerned about Stewart&#x27;s association with the Know Nothing Party and the apparent rise of a ruling class in society.

===The battle for the &quot;Bloody Fifth&quot;===
As a result of the 1880 census, the United States Congress decided to allocate a new congressional seat to the Upper Country, creating the Fifth Minnesota District. Nelson quietly entered the race for this seat. First he secured a seat on the Board of Regents at the University of Minnesota, where he managed to establish a Department of Scandinavian Studies.

The campaign opened in 1882 and quickly devolved into one of the most contentious elections in history at that point. The contest between Nelson and Charles F. Kindred for the &quot;Bloody Fifth&quot;, as it became known, involved widespread graft, intimidation, and election fraud. The Republican convention on July 12 in Detroit Lakes was compared to the historic Battle of the Boyne in Ireland. 150 delegates fought over 80 seats, and after a scuffle in the main conference center, the Kindred and Nelson campaigns nominated their candidates.

The rivalry between Kindred and Nelson centered to a large extent on the two competing railroads in the Upper Country, the Northern Pacific in Kindred&#x27;s corner and the Great Northern in Nelson&#x27;s. Kindred spent between $150,000 and $200,000, but Nelson won handily, overcoming massive election fraud in Northern Pacific counties.

===U.S. House of Representatives, 1883–1889===

Nelson served in the United States House of Representatives from March 4, 1883, to March 4, 1889, in the 48th, 49th, and 50th congresses. In keeping with practices of the Gilded Age, his first agenda item in Congress was to ensure patronage for his supporters in Minnesota by doling out the limited number of federal appointments available. Most were made through Paul C. Sletten, the Receiver of the U.S. Land Office in Crookston. In addition to rewarding political support, he replaced pro-Kindred appointees in the forested counties around the Northern Pacific Railroad, the so-called &quot;Pineries.&quot; Particularly publicized was the firing of Søren Listoe as Register of the U.S. Land Office in Fergus Falls.

Nelson did not always follow the orthodox Republican line in the House. In 1886, he abandoned the Republican caucus to vote for the Morrison Tariff Bill of 1886, which sought to reduce the tariffs on some imported items. Two years later, he and three other Republicans voted for the more aggressive tariff reductions in the Mills Tariff Bill of 1888. Although passed by the House on July 21, 1888, the Mills Bill was so heavily amended by the high-tariff Republicans in the Senate that the House found the result unacceptable, and no changes to the tariff were made in 1888.

Nelson was frustrated by what he perceived as the House&#x27;s lack of effectiveness. He got involved in long debates about pension issues for Civil War veterans. His most notable legacy as a representative was passing the Nelson Act of 1889. It created the White Earth Indian Reservation in western Minnesota as a place to consolidate Native Americans from other reservations in the state, allocated communal land to heads of households, and opened up sale of the remaining thousands of acres of land to immigrants, at Native Americans&#x27; expense.

Considering his time in the House a &quot;personal failure&quot;, Nelson decided not to seek reelection in 1888. Some suspect that a narrow escape from a drowning accident on October 11, 1886, also played a role in increasing his ambition.

===Governor of Minnesota, 1893–1895===
Though Nelson claimed to retire from politics, he remained an active insider in Minnesota Republican politics. In 1890 he started showing interest in running for governor. Meanwhile, he resumed an active law practice from Alexandria, continued running his farm, and opened a hardware store.

Increasing pressure on the Minnesotan agricultural economy gave rise to the Farmers&#x27; Alliance, which became a formidable political force in both parties, but especially the Republican Party. In 1890, the alliance voted to run its own candidates, and suggested nominating Nelson. In the Minnesota alliance convention in July 1890, Nelson did not acknowledge interest from the delegates, who ended up nominating Sidney M. Owen. But after the Alliance made a strong showing in the 1890 legislative election, Republicans saw Nelson as a strong alternative to the Alliance in the Upper Country.

Nelson worked to strengthen his candidacy for governor, though historians suggest that his ultimate goal was the U.S. Senate. He arranged to be drafted as a candidate rather than actively pursuing office. Appointed officeholders, fearing the loss of patronage to Alliance political victories, were glad to support him. Appealing to the Republican need for unity at the convention, Nelson maneuvered to gain the support of rivals such as Davis and Washburn, or at least avoid their opposition. He was unanimously nominated by 709 delegates as the Republican candidate for governor on July 28, 1892, at the St. Paul People&#x27;s Church. His acceptance speech was a libertarian broadside against both Democrats and Populists; it emboldened the delegates for the campaign.

The ensuing campaign against Democratic nominee Daniel Lawler and Populist Ignatius Donnelly centered on allegations of undue influence by railroad interests, tariffs, and ethnicity and patriotism. When Nelson took the campaign to northwestern Minnesota, he had a minor physical altercation with Tobias Sawby, a local populist. After a grueling campaign, he carried 51 of 80 counties with 42.6% of the vote to Lawler&#x27;s 37% and Donnelly&#x27;s 15.6%. He gave a short victory speech in Alexandria, saying, &quot;I go in without having made any promises to any combine, corporation, or person, and shall endeavor to do right, because it is right, and I endeavor to give an administration for the people, for the people, and by the people.&quot;

There were significant limitations on Governor Nelson&#x27;s ability to pursue his agenda. The balance of power in Minnesota was shared among five independently elected officials, the state legislature, and the governor. In his inaugural speech on January 4, 1893, he presented himself as a fiscal conservative with an affinity for education and dwelled on statistics related to various state services and for solutions.

Nelson used his governorship as a bully pulpit for modest Republican reforms intended to provide moderate alternatives to the radical Populist actions. He promoted the &quot;Governor&#x27;s Grain Bill&quot; as a way to regulate trade in grain, specifically by giving the Railroad and Warehouse Commission the authority to license, inspect, and regulate country grain elevators. Republican members of the legislature supported it as well, going so far as making it a party measure. Opposition to the bill from Democrats and Populists was based on suspicion of the railroad commission. The bill went through two rounds of voting with considerable horse-trading but in the end won narrowly, giving Nelson credibility as a political force.

Nelson also ended up cooperating with his former adversary Donnelly on the &quot;timber ring&quot; investigation; it sought to end land claim fraud in lumber areas. Nelson convened an interstate antitrust Conference in Chicago on June 5, 1893, where he spoke against the lumber trust and in favor of strengthening the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.

The Panic of 1893 created a crisis for the railroad companies. After a series of wage cuts by the Great Northern, the American Railway Union went on strike on April 13. Nelson suggested the parties engage in arbitration while demanding law and order from the strikers. He left enforcement to federal marshals and arbitration to private business leaders. The strike was resolved largely in favor of the workers, and Nelson survived untarnished.

Nelson was handily renominated in 1894, and ran against Populist Sidney Owen and Democrat George Becker. He projected the image of a systematic and scientific reformer compared to such populist speakers as Mary Ellen Lease and Jerry Simpson. He demonstrated hands-on leadership in the dry summer of 1894, when the Great Hinckley Fire spread across east-central Minnesota on September 1. Although the state did not have the financial means to provide direct support, Nelson used his office to encourage private relief efforts. He won the election with 60,000 more votes than Owen.

===United States Senator, 1895–1923===

====Nelson vs. Washburn====
Nelson&#x27;s campaign for election to the United States Senate was reported to have begun early in 1894. It was conducted quietly and behind the scenes, to avoid the appearance that his bid for governorship was less than genuine, and to avoid an internal Republican feud with incumbent U.S. Senator William D. Washburn. Before the 17th Amendment went into effect in 1914, state legislatures elected their U.S. senators. Nelson&#x27;s campaign for Senate was a &quot;still hunt,&quot; consisting of building support among incoming legislators while letting Washburn think he was running unopposed for the Republican nomination.

Sensing Nelson&#x27;s rising star in the Republican establishment, Washburn tried to obtain Nelson&#x27;s unequivocal assurance that he was not running for Senate, while solidifying his own standing as the Minneapolis candidate. On September 21, 1894, the two candidates met at the Freeborn county fair in Albert Lea, where Nelson was asked directly whether he supported Washburn&#x27;s candidacy or had his own designs on the seat. He reportedly advised the state legislature to &quot;elect your Republican legislative ticket, so as to send my friend Washburn back the United States senate, or if you do not like him, send some other good Republican.&quot;

Nelson&#x27;s strategy was to prevent Washburn from gaining a straightforward majority in either the nomination or the election in the Republican caucus, and to appear as a unifying choice for the Republicans. He had to strike a fine balance between appealing to Scandinavian ethnic pride on the one hand and affirming himself a true American on the other, and between the appearance of treachery against Washburn and maintaining an honest impression.

The campaign came to a head in the so-called &quot;Three Week War&quot; or &quot;Hotel Campaign&quot;, which was in full force by January 5, 1895. The confrontations, lobbying, cajoling, and alleged bribery centered on St. Paul&#x27;s Windsor and Merchants hotels. Legislators were unnerved by the campaign, and the outcome remained uncertain. Return visits to their constituencies in mid-January did little to clarify public opinion. Public meetings with &quot;wirepullers&quot; had similarly little effect.

Nelson&#x27;s strength became apparent but was not yet decisive on January 18 when the Republicans caucused. Washburn fell well short of reaching the necessary 72 votes, and a number of erstwhile supporters fell to Nelson on the second ballot. By the time the election went to the full legislature, it was clear that Washburn had lost. On January 23 Nelson was elected to the United States Senate, the first Scandinavian-born American to reach this post. Exhausted from the campaign, Washburn called for direct, popular elections of senators. It is remembered as one of the bitterest elections in Minnesota political history.

Washburn was perceived as a wealthy, urban, aristocratic native Yankee from Maine, and Nelson as a hard-working immigrant from the Upper Country. Nelson&#x27;s victory reinforced the growing influence of areas of Minnesota outside the Twin Cities, and strengthened political awareness among ethnic Scandinavians in the region. Nelson decided early to make this image his platform, asking his constituency to call him &quot;Uncle Knute.&quot;

====First Senate term====
The 54th United States Congress did not convene until December 1895, and though Nelson was eager to get to work, he spent the recess traveling and working on his farm. He also translated the Constitution of Norway to English and studied the Free Silver issue. This was the subject of his first Senate speech, on December 31, 1895, when he advocated a paper currency.

Nelson maintained—as he did throughout his career—a strong anti-Populist, though pragmatic, profile. His most important first-term accomplishment was probably the Nelson Bankruptcy Law, intended to give farmers the means to enter into voluntary, as opposed to forced, bankruptcy by creditors. He positioned this as an alternative to the Judiciary Committee that was much harsher to debtors. Although he championed the bill on its own merits, it also gave him an opportunity both to disassociate himself from his background as an attorney and to build favor with his agricultural constituency. After 18 months of painstaking negotiations, Nelson managed to get the bill passed by Congress on June 24, 1898. Filing bankruptcy would be known for some time afterwards as &quot;taking the Nelson cure.&quot;

If Nelson showed independence in the bankruptcy law, he toed the party line on the Spanish–American War, enthusiastically supporting the war effort. He got embroiled in a bitter debate on the Senate floor on the issue of annexing the Philippines and Hawaii. He and one of the authors of the treaty, senior Minnesota senator Cushman Davis, voted with the majority in ratifying the Treaty of Paris. He is often quoted as saying:

Providence has given the United States the duty of extending Christian civilization. We come as ministering angels, not despots. 

====Return to Norway====
Nelson always took care in public to define himself first and foremost as an American, with no conflicted loyalty to his birth country. But in the background he supported Norway in various ways, notably by inviting Norwegian officers to observe and learn from American tactics in Cuba. He had been planning a trip to Norway for some time, but made sure he would also visit Sweden and Denmark, emphasizing his Scandinavian-American background.

He traveled alone and made his home town of Evanger one of the first stops. He arrived at the village in a horse-drawn buggy with only his luggage and was received as an honored guest. He spoke in his native dialect of Vossemål, slipping into Riksmål only when he felt it necessary to make an important political point. His hosts quickly started addressing him in the familiar &quot;du Knut,&quot; which he appeared to enjoy.

From Evanger, Nelson traveled to Kristiania, where he refused official honors, and to Stockholm, where he made even less fuss. He spent a week in Copenhagen, visiting with his own patronage appointees Laurits S. Swenson, U.S. ambassador to Denmark, and Søren Listoe, consul to Rotterdam. He had an audience with King Christian IX and a formal dinner hosted by Swenson. He traveled through the contentious area of Schleswig-Holstein and the site of the Battle of Waterloo.

Nelson traveled home via England and happened to be in the visitors&#x27; gallery in the British parliament on October 17 when Queen Victoria convened an extraordinary session to debate the Second Boer War.

====1900–1902 reelection campaign====
Owing, once again, to his being elected by the state legislature, Nelson&#x27;s campaign for reelection in 1902 started with the Minnesota state legislature elections of 1900. His strategy was to align himself with celebrated national leaders, especially Theodore Roosevelt and Robert M. La Follette Sr., as they swung through the state campaigning for William McKinley. Nelson was known more for thoroughness than charisma in his campaigns, but contributed significantly to the Republican success that year. Nelson&#x27;s son Henry Knute Nelson was elected to the Minnesota state legislature that year.

Nelson&#x27;s reelection to a second Senate term was assured for all practical purposes. The campaign continued into 1902, when Nelson made a name for himself by commandeering a handcar when his train broke down east of Hibbing, Minnesota. He made his own way to Wolf Junction, Minnesota at a brisk pace.

Until that point, Nelson&#x27;s political career was largely based on the issues of an unfolding economic frontier, with land development, immigration, and Gilded Age dynamics. With the birth of the Progressive Era, the winds of reform started blowing more from the east than the west, and urban issues came more to the forefront. As a result, Nelson had to reinvent his political strategy.

In the crosswinds of the political movements of the time, Nelson chose a largely &quot;moderate progressive&quot; profile, accepting government intervention on some issues (such as antitrust matters) but opposing anything that smacked of socialism. He eased up on patronage as a political tool and focused instead on helping his constituents in matters small and large, often invoking the image of himself as a &quot;drayhorse&quot;—a hard-working, persistent advocate for the things and people he believed in.

====Territories and statehood====

In the Senate, Nelson was involved in creating the Department of Commerce and Labor and the 1898 passage of the Nelson Bankruptcy Act, and served on the Overman Committee from 1918 to 1919. Serving from 1895 to 1923, he was a senator from the 54th through the 67th congresses. He was an active senator until his death in 1923 en route by train from Washington, D.C., to his hometown of Alexandria, where he was buried.

<text>Dingolfing-Landau is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Straubing-Bogen, Deggendorf, Rottal-Inn and Landshut.

==History==
The district was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Dingolfing and Landau (Isar). Its original name was Untere Isar (&quot;Lower Isar&quot;), but in 1973 it was renamed and got its present name.

==Geography==
The region is characterised by very plain countryside and several rivers running from southwest to northeast (towards the Danube). Most important rivers of the district are the Isar and the Vils.

==Economy==

The whole region depends on the automobile industry. At Dingolfing, you can find the largest BMW-Industry complex in the world.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* The blue and white checkered pattern of Bavaria
* The lion from the arms of the county of Leonberg (once ruling in Landau)
* The red and white bars are from the arms of the county of Frontenhausen (once ruling in Dingolfing)

<doc id="250661" wikidata="Q11338080" url="?curid=250661" title="Horatio Nelson Jackson">
<text>Horatio Nelson Jackson (March 25, 1872 – January 14, 1955) was an American physician, Army medical officer, and automobile pioneer. In 1903, he and his hired mechanic and driving partner Sewall K. Crocker became the first people to drive an automobile across the United States, a road trip from San Francisco to New York City, with additional miles travelled to his home in Vermont.

==Early life and medical career==
Jackson was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on March 25, 1872, a son of Samuel Nelson Jackson (1838–1913) and Mary Anne (Parkyn) Jackson (1843–1916). His siblings included John Holmes Jackson, who served several terms as mayor of Burlington, Vermont. Another brother, S. Hollister Jackson, served as Lieutenant governor of Vermont. Jackson attended the schools of Toronto and Toronto&#x27;s collegiate institute. He graduated with an MD degree from the University of Vermont in 1893, became a physician, and practiced in Brattleboro and Burlington. He married Bertha Richardson Wells, the daughter of William Wells, a Medal of Honor recipient and one of the richest men in Vermont as a partner in Wells, Richardson &amp; Co., manufacturer of Paine&#x27;s Celery Compound, a popular patent medicine. H. Nelson Jackson and Bertha Wells were the parents of daughter Bertha (1906–1984), the wife of George B. Kolk and the longtime editor of the &quot;Burlington Daily News&quot;, of which her father was publisher.

==Cross-country drive==
===Wager and preparations===
Besides his medical practice, Jackson was an auto enthusiast who differed with the then-prevailing wisdom that the automobile was a passing fad and a recreational plaything. While in San Francisco&#x27;s University Club as a guest on May 18, 1903, he agreed to a $50 wager (equivalent to $ in ) to prove that a four-wheeled machine could be driven across the country. He accepted, even though at age 31 he did not own a car, had practically no experience driving, and had no maps to follow. Jackson and his wife planned to return to their Burlington, Vermont, home in a few days, and both had been taking automobile driving lessons while in San Francisco. She returned home by train, allowing him to take his adventure by automobile.
Having no mechanical experience, Jackson convinced a young mechanic and chauffeur, Sewall K. Crocker, to serve as his travel companion, mechanic, and backup driver. Crocker suggested that Jackson buy a Winton car. He bought a slightly used, two-cylinder, 20 hp Winton, which he named the &quot;Vermont&quot;, after his home state, bade his wife goodbye, and left San Francisco on May 23, carrying coats, rubber protective suits, sleeping bags, blankets, canteens, a water bag, an axe, a shovel, a telescope, tools, spare parts, a block and tackle, cans for extra gasoline and oil, a Kodak camera, a rifle, a shotgun, and pistols.

Heeding the failed attempt by automobile pioneer Alexander Winton (founder of the Winton Motor Carriage Company, which manufactured Jackson&#x27;s car) to cross the deserts of Nevada and Utah, Jackson decided to take a more northerly route through the Sacramento Valley and along the Oregon Trail. This allowed them to avoid the higher passes in the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains.

===Journey===

On May 23, 1903, the car was transported by ferry from San Francisco to Oakland and pointed eastward. But only into the journey, the car blew a tire. Jackson and Crocker replaced it with the only spare they had, in fact, the only right-sized spare tire they could find in all of San Francisco.

On the first night of the journey they discovered that the side lanterns were too dim. On the second night, they stopped early in Sacramento and replaced them with a large spotlight mounted on the front of the &quot;Vermont&quot;. The duo was also assisted in Sacramento by bicyclists who offered them road maps. Jackson was unable to buy a new tire, but purchased some used inner tubes.

Going northwards out of Sacramento, the noise of the car covered the fact that the duo&#x27;s cooking gear was falling off. They were also given a misdirection by a woman so that she could send them to the spot where her family could see an automobile.

The rough trek towards Oregon required them to haul the car across deep streams with the block and tackle. Somewhere along this route, Jackson lost a pair of his glasses. Items continued to be lost, including another pair of Jackson&#x27;s glasses. They were also forced to pay a $4 (equivalent to $ in ) toll by a land-owner in order to cross his property on a &quot;bad, rocky, mountain road&quot; as Jackson described it. When their tires blew out they were required to wind rope around the wheels. Jackson did manage to find a telegraph office and wired back to San Francisco for replacement tires to be transported to them along the journey.

Reaching Alturas, California, Jackson and Crocker stopped to wait for the tires. They offered locals rides in the car in exchange for a &quot;wild west show&quot;. When the tires failed to materialize, however, they continued on after a three-day wait.

On June 6, the car broke down, and they had to be towed to a nearby ranch by a cowboy on horseback. Crocker made repairs, but a fuel leak caused them to lose all of their available gasoline, and Jackson rented a bicycle for Crocker to travel to Burns, Oregon, for fuel. After suffering a flat tire on the bicycle, he returned with of fuel (which Jackson complained cost him &quot;nearly twenty dollars&quot;), and they returned to Burns to fill up.

On June 9, outside of Vale, Oregon, the &quot;Vermont&quot; ran out of oil. Jackson walked back to the last town to get oil, only to discover eventually that they had been stopped only a short distance outside of Vale. The next day they arrived in Ontario, Oregon, where supplies waited for them.
Somewhere near Caldwell, Idaho, Jackson and Crocker obtained a dog, a bulldog named Bud. Jackson had wanted a dog companion since Sacramento. Newspapers at the time gave a variety of stories of how Bud was acquired, including that he was stolen; in a letter to his wife, Nelson said a man sold him the dog for $15 (equivalent to $ in ). It turned out that the dusty alkali flats the travelers encountered would bother Bud&#x27;s eyes so much (the &quot;Vermont&quot; had neither a roof nor windshield) that Jackson eventually fitted him with a pair of goggles. At one point, Bud drank bad water and became ill, but survived.

At this point, the trio became celebrities. The press came out at every stop to take their picture and conduct interviews. At Mountain Home, Idaho, citizens warned them that the Oregon Trail was not good further east, so Jackson and Crocker veered off their original course along the southern edge of the Sawtooth Mountains. At Hailey, Idaho, Crocker wired the Winton Company for more parts.

On June 16, somewhere in Idaho, Jackson&#x27;s coat, containing most of the travelers&#x27; money, fell off and was not found. At their next stop, Jackson had to wire his wife to send them money to Cheyenne, Wyoming. Between June 20 and 21, all three of them got lost in Wyoming, and went without food for 36 hours before finding a sheepherder who gave them a meal of roast lamb and boiled corn. Before reaching Cheyenne, however, the car&#x27;s wheel bearings gave out, and Crocker had to talk a farmer into letting them have the wheel bearings of his mowing machine.

The travelers eventually reached Omaha, Nebraska, on July 12. From there on, they were able to use a few paved roads, and their trip was much easier. The only mishap happened just east of Buffalo, New York, when the &quot;Vermont&quot; ran into a hidden obstacle in the road and Jackson, Crocker, and Bud were thrown from the car. They arrived in New York City on July 26, 1903, 63 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes after commencing their journey in San Francisco, in the first automobile to successfully transit the North American continent. Their trip expended over of gasoline.

After leaving New York City Jackson joined his wife and drove home to Vermont. About from home his car once again broke down. His two brothers, each driving his own automobile, came to help him get going again. Shortly after returning to the road, both of the brothers&#x27; vehicles broke down, and Jackson towed them both home with the &quot;Vermont&quot;. Upon reaching the threshold of Jackson&#x27;s garage, the &quot;Vermont&quot;&#x27;s drive chain snapped. It was one of the few original parts never replaced during the entire journey.

==Business career==
Jackson continued to reside in Burlington, Vermont, with his wife Bertha and Bud the dog. He was active in several businesses, including a granite manufacturing company owned by his brother Hollister. (Hollister Jackson was serving as Lieutenant Governor of Vermont when he died in the Great Vermont Flood of 1927.)

==World War I==
A longtime member of the Vermont National Guard when World War I broke out, Jackson was considered too old for active service, but he contacted former President Theodore Roosevelt (whom he had met at some point in Burlington), through his influence Jackson was placed on active duty as a captain in the Medical Corps. While attached to the 313th Infantry, 79th Division as a surgeon, Jackson was wounded near Montfaucon during the Meuse–Argonne Offensive.

==Awards and decorations==

Jackson&#x27;s military awards included the Distinguished Service Cross, the Legion of Honour, and the Croix de Guerre.

===Distinguished Service Cross citation ===
==Later life== 

Jackson was one of the founders and known as the &quot;Daddy&quot; of the American Legion of Vermont. He also served as a senior officer in the Officer Reserve Corps. He twice ran for Governor of Vermont. In addition to owning and publishing the Burlington Daily News, he was head of the Burlington Trust Company, and owned and operated radio station WCAX (now WVMT). At one point he was ticketed for exceeding the speed limit in Burlington.

Jackson died on January 14, 1955, in Burlington, Vermont, and was buried in the Lakeview Cemetery there.

==&quot;Vermont&quot;==
In 1944, Jackson gave his Winton, the &quot;Vermont&quot;, to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where it is preserved.

==In popular culture==
Documentary film maker Ken Burns produced a film, &quot;Horatio&#x27;s Drive&quot;, for PBS. The film is based on the book of the same name by Dayton Duncan. Tom Hanks provided the voice-over narration for Horatio Nelson Jackson. The film features many old songs, framed by a popular number from 1914 called &quot;He&#x27;d Have to Get Under – Get Out and Get Under (to Fix Up His Automobile)&quot;.

<text>Chinese tabloid is a newspaper format that became extremely popular in the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the mid-1990s. Like tabloids in the rest of the world, they focus on sensationalism and scandal.

==History==
The rise of the tabloid format is associated with withdrawal of governmental subsidies to newspapers in the late 1980s. Faced with the possibility of bankruptcy, many newspapers changed their formats to emphasize investigative reporting and bold editorial policies. Many of these newspapers are owned by units of the Chinese Communist Party; however, this ownership has the odd effect of giving the newspapers the political cover to take a more critical line against the government.

Others argue that although tabloids have inadvertently led to a fragmented and decentralized press structure that undermines core party organs, the Chinese regime has maintained a fundamental stronghold on public discourse through media market influence and political control.

==Notable coverage==
Chinese tabloids have been crucial in breaking some of the major stories on social crises facing mainland China including the AIDS epidemic in Henan, the dangers of coal mining, and the corruption inherent in the system of custody and repatriation.

<text>A fairy chess piece, variant chess piece, unorthodox chess piece, or heterodox chess piece is a chess piece not used in conventional chess but incorporated into certain chess variants and some unorthodox chess problems, known as fairy chess. Compared to conventional pieces, fairy pieces vary mostly in the way they move, but they may also follow special rules for capturing, promotions, etc. Because of the distributed and uncoordinated nature of unorthodox chess development, the same piece can have different names, and different pieces can have the same name in various contexts.

Most are symbolised as inverted or rotated icons of the standard pieces in diagrams, and the meanings of these &quot;wildcards&quot; must be defined in each context separately. Pieces invented for use in chess variants rather than problems sometimes instead have special icons designed for them, but with some exceptions (the princess, empress, and occasionally amazon), many of these are not used beyond the individual games for which they were invented.

== Background ==

The earliest known forms of chess date from the 7th century in Persia (chatrang) and India (chaturanga). They had different rules from the modern game. The game was then transmitted to the Arabs, then to the Europeans, and for several centuries, it was played with those ancient rules. For example, the queen was once able to move only a single square diagonally, while the bishop could jump two squares diagonally. The change of rules occurred in Spain in the end of the 15th century when the queen and the bishop were given the moves they have today. In the old Muslim manuscripts those two pieces were referred as a &quot;ferz&quot; (meaning advisor) and &quot;fil&quot; (meaning elephant). The queen is still called &quot;ferz&quot; in Russian and Ukrainian and the bishop is still called alfil (from &quot;al fil&quot;, with the article) in Spanish. Due to the piece&#x27;s change in movement, the ferz and the alfil are now considered non-standard chess pieces. As those who created modern chess did in the 15th century, modern chess enthusiasts still often create their own variations of the rules and the way the pieces move. Pieces that move differently from today&#x27;s standard rules are called &quot;variant&quot; or &quot;fairy&quot; chess pieces.

The names of fairy pieces are not standardised, and most do not have standard symbols associated with them. Most are typically represented in diagrams by rotated versions of the icons for normal pieces, though there are a few exceptions that sometimes get their own icons: the equihopper, the knighted pieces (princess, empress, and amazon), and a few of the basic leapers (e.g. wazir, ferz, and alfil). This article uses common names for the pieces described whenever possible, but these names sometimes differ between circles associated with chess problems and circles associated with chess variants.

== Classification ==

Many of the simplest fairy chess pieces do not appear in the orthodox game, but they usually fall into one of three classes. There are also compound pieces that combine the movement powers of two or more different pieces.

=== Simple pieces ===

==== Leapers ====
A leaper is a piece that moves directly to a square a fixed distance away. A leaper captures by occupying the square on which an enemy piece sits. The leaper&#x27;s move cannot be blocked (unlike elephant and horse in Xiangqi and Janggi) – it &quot;leaps&quot; over any intervening pieces – so the check of a leaper cannot be parried by interposing. Leapers are not able to create pins, but are effective forking pieces. A leaper&#x27;s move that is not orthogonal (i.e. horizontal or vertical) nor diagonal is said to be &quot;hippogonal&quot;.

Moves by a leaper may be described using the distance to their landing square – the number of squares orthogonally in one direction and the number of squares orthogonally at right angles. For instance, the orthodox knight is described as a (1,2)-leaper or a (2,1)-leaper. The table to the right shows common (but by no means standard) names for the leapers reaching up to 4 squares, together with the letter used to represent them in Betza notation, a common notation for describing fairy pieces.

Although moves to adjacent squares are not strictly &quot;leaps&quot; by the normal use of the word, they are included for generality. Leapers that move only to adjacent squares are sometimes called &quot;step movers&quot; in the context of shogi variants.

In shatranj, a Persian forerunner to chess, the predecessors of the bishop and queen were leapers: the alfil is a (2,2)-leaper (moving two squares diagonally in any direction), and the ferz a (1,1)-leaper (moving one square diagonally in any direction). The wazir is a (0,1)-leaper (an &quot;orthogonal&quot; one-square leaper). The dabbaba is a (0,2)-leaper. The &#x27;level-3&#x27; leapers are the threeleaper (0,3), camel (1,3), zebra (2,3), and tripper (3,3). The fourleaper (0,4), giraffe (1,4), stag (2,4), antelope (3,4), and commuter (4,4) are level-4 leapers. Many of these basic leapers appear in Tamerlane chess.


==== Riders ====
A rider, or ranging piece, is a piece that moves an unlimited distance in one direction, provided there are no pieces in the way. Each basic rider corresponds to a basic leaper, and can be thought of as repeating that leaper&#x27;s move in one direction until an obstacle is reached. If the obstacle is a friendly piece, it blocks further movement; if the obstacle is an enemy piece, it may be captured, but it cannot be jumped over.

There are three riders in : the rook is a (0,1)-rider; the bishop is a (1,1)-rider; and the queen combines both patterns. Sliders are a special case of riders that can only move between geometrically contiguous cells. All of the riders in orthodox chess are examples of sliders.

Riders can create both pins and skewers. One popular fairy chess rider is the nightrider, which can make an unlimited number of knight moves in any direction (like other riders, it cannot change direction partway through its move). The names of riders are often obtained by taking the name of its base leaper and adding the suffix &quot;rider&quot;. For example, the zebrarider is a (2,3)-rider. A nightrider can be blocked only on a square one of its component knight moves falls on: if a nightrider starts on a1, it can be blocked on b3 or c2, but not on a2, b2, or b1. It can only travel from a1 to c5 if the intervening square b3 is unoccupied.

Some generalised riders do not follow a straight path. The Aanca from the historical game of Grant Acedrex is such a &quot;bent rider&quot;: it takes its first step like a ferz and continues &quot;outward&quot; from that destination like a rook. The unicorn, from the same game, takes its first step like a knight and continues outward from that destination like a bishop. The &quot;rose&quot;, which is used in chess on a really big board, traces out a path of knight moves on an approximate regular octagon: from e1, it can go to g2, h4, g6, e7, c6, b4, c2, and back to e1. The &quot;crooked bishop&quot; or &quot;boyscout&quot; follows a zigzag: starting from f1, its path could take it to e2, f3, e4, f5, e6, f7, and e8 (or g2, f3, g4, f5, g6, f7, and g8).

A &quot;limited ranging piece&quot; moves like a rider, but only up to a specific number of steps. An example is the &quot;short rook&quot; from Chess with different armies: it moves like a rook, but only up to a distance of 4 squares. From a1, it can travel in one move to b1, c1, d1, or e1, but not f1. A rider&#x27;s corresponding leaper can be thought of as a limited ranging piece with a range of 1: a wazir is a rook restricted to moving only one square at a time. The &quot;violent ox&quot; and &quot;flying dragon&quot; from dai shogi (an ancient form of Japanese chess) are a range-2 rook and a range-2 bishop respectively.

There are other possible generalisations as well; the &quot;picket&quot; from Tamerlane chess moves like a bishop, but &quot;at least&quot; two squares (thus it cannot stop on the square next to it, but it can be blocked there.) These are in general called &quot;ski&quot;-pieces: the picket is a ski-bishop. A &quot;skip&quot;-rider skips over the first and then every odd cell in its path: it cannot be blocked on the squares it skips. Thus a &quot;skip-rook&quot; would be a dabbabarider, and a &quot;skip-bishop&quot; would be an alfilrider. A &quot;slip&quot;-rider is similar, but skips over the &quot;second&quot; and then every &quot;even&quot; cell in its path.

In some shogi variants (variants of Japanese chess), there are also &quot;area moves&quot;. These are similar to limited ranging pieces in that the pieces with such moves repeat one kind of basic step up to a fixed number of times, and must stop when they capture. However, unlike other riders, they may change direction during their move, and do not have a fixed path shape like riders or bent riders do.

==== Hoppers ====

A hopper is a piece that moves by jumping over another piece (called a hurdle). The hurdle can be any piece of any color. Unless it can jump over a piece, a hopper cannot move. Note that hoppers generally capture by taking the piece on the destination square, &quot;not&quot; by taking the hurdle (as is the case in checkers). The exceptions are locusts which are pieces that capture by hopping over its victim. They are sometimes considered a type of hopper.

There are no hoppers in Western chess. In xiangqi (Chinese chess), the cannon captures as a hopper along rook lines (when not capturing, it is a (0,1)-rider which cannot jump, the same as a rook); in janggi (Korean chess), the cannon is a hopper along rook lines when moving or capturing, except it cannot jump another cannon, whether friendly or enemy. The grasshopper moves along the same lines as a queen, hopping over another piece and landing on the square immediately beyond it. Yang Qi includes the diagonal counterpart of the cannon, the vao, which moves as a bishop and captures as a hopper along bishop lines.

=== Compound pieces ===

Compound pieces combine the powers of two or more pieces. The queen may be considered the compound of a rook and a bishop. The king of standard chess combines the ferz and wazir, ignoring restrictions on check and checkmate and ignoring castling. The alibaba combines the dabbaba and alfil, while the squirrel can move to any square 2 units away (combining the knight and alibaba). The phoenix combines the wazir and alfil, while the kirin combines the ferz and dabbaba: both appear in chu shogi, an old Japanese chess variant that is still sometimes played today.

An amphibian is a combined leaper with a larger range than any of its components, such as the frog, a (1,1)-(0,3)-leaper. Although the (1,1)-leaper is confined to one half of the board, and the (0,3)-leaper to one ninth, their combination can reach any square on the board.

When one of the combined pieces is a knight, the compound may be called a knighted piece. The archbishop, chancellor, and amazon are three popular compound pieces, combining the powers of non-royal orthodox chess pieces. They are the knighted bishop, knighted rook, and knighted queen respectively. When one of the combined pieces is a king, the compound may be called a crowned piece. The crowned knight combines the knight with the king&#x27;s moves (when royal, it is called a knighted king). The dragon king of shogi is a crowned rook (rook + king), while the dragon horse is a crowned bishop (bishop + king). The knighted compounds show that a compound piece may not fall into any of the three basic categories from above: a princess slides for its bishop moves (and can be blocked by obstacles in those directions), but leaps for its knight moves (and cannot be blocked in those directions). (The names &quot;princess&quot; and &quot;empress&quot; are common in the problemist tradition: in chess variants involving these pieces they are often called by other names, such as &quot;archbishop&quot; and &quot;chancellor&quot; in Capablanca chess, or &quot;cardinal&quot; and &quot;marshal&quot; in Grand Chess, respectively.) Combinations of known pieces with the falcon from falcon chess are named winged pieces, in Complete Permutation Chess not only winged knight, bishop, rook, and queen are featured, but also winged marshal, winged cardinal, and winged amazon.

Marine pieces are compound pieces consisting of a rider or leaper (for ordinary moves) and a locust (for captures) in the same directions. Marine pieces have names alluding to the sea and its myths, e.g., nereide (marine bishop), triton (marine rook), mermaid (marine queen), and poseidon (marine king). Examples named for non-mythical sea creatures include the seahorse (marine knight), dolphin (marine nightrider), anemone (marine guard or mann), and prawn (marine pawn). Games that consist of these marine pieces, known as &quot;sea chesses&quot;, are often played on larger boards to account for these pieces needing more squares available for their locust-like capturing moves.

=== Restricted pieces===
In addition to combining the powers of pieces, pieces can also be modified by restricting them in certain ways: for example, their power might only be used for moving, only for capturing, only forwards, only backwards, only sideways, only on their first move, only on a specific square, only against a specific piece, and so on. The &quot;horse&quot; in xiangqi (Chinese chess) is a knight that cannot leap: it can be blocked on the square orthogonally adjacent to it. The &quot;stone general&quot; from dai shogi is a ferz that can only move forwards (and therefore is trapped when it reaches the end of the board).

Such restrictions may themselves be combined. The &quot;gold general&quot; from shogi (Japanese chess) is the combination of a wazir and a forward-only ferz; the &quot;silver general&quot; from shogi is the combination of a ferz and a forward-only wazir. The pawn has the power of a wazir, but only forward and for movement; the power of a ferz, but only forward and for capturing; the power of a rook with a limited range of 2 squares, but only forward, without capturing, and on its first move; the power to be replaced by a more powerful piece, but only upon reaching its last rank; and the power to capture &quot;en passant&quot;. A piece that moves and captures differently, like the pawn, is called &quot;divergent&quot;.

There are some powerful notation systems, described below, that can more succinctly represent arbitrary combinations of the basic restrictions of basic pieces.

=== Capturing ===
All of the above pieces move once per turn and capture by replacement (i.e., moving to their victim&#x27;s square and replacing it) except in the case of the &quot;en passant&quot; capture. A &quot;shooting&quot; piece (as in Rifle Chess) does &quot;not&quot; capture by replacement (it stays in place when making a capture). Such a shooting capture is termed &quot;igui&quot; &quot;stationary feeding&quot; in the old Japanese variants where it is common. Baroque chess has many examples of pieces that do not capture by replacement, such as the &quot;withdrawer&quot;, a piece which captures an adjacent piece by moving directly &quot;away&quot; from it.

=== Moving multiple times per turn ===
The lion in chu shogi, as do the pieces in Marseillais chess, can move &quot;twice per turn&quot;: such pieces are common in the old Japanese variants of chess, termed shogi variants, where they are called &quot;lion moves&quot; after the simplest example. The lion is a king with the power to move twice per turn: thus it can capture a piece and &quot;then&quot; move on, possibly capturing another, or returning to its original square. When a double-moving piece captures and then returns to its original square, it acts like a shooting piece.

Some classes of pieces come from a certain game, and will have common characteristics. Examples are the pieces from xiangqi, a Chinese game similar to chess. The most common are the &quot;leo&quot;, &quot;pao&quot; and &quot;vao&quot; (derived from the Chinese cannon) and the &quot;mao&quot; (derived from the horse). Those derived from the cannon are distinguished by moving as a hopper when capturing, but otherwise moving as a rider.

Pieces from xiangqi are usually circular disks, labeled or engraved with a Chinese character identifying the piece. Pieces from shogi (Japanese chess) are usually wedge-shaped chips, with kanji characters identifying the piece.

=== Special attributes ===
Fairy pieces vary in the way they move, but some may also have other special characteristics or powers. The joker (in one of its definitions) mimics the last move made by the opponent. So for example, if White moves a bishop, Black can follow by moving the joker as a bishop. The orphan has no movement powers of its own, but moves like any enemy piece attacking it: so if a rook attacks an orphan, the orphan now has the movement powers of the rook, but those are lost if the enemy rook moves away. Orphans can use these relayed powers to attack each other, creating a chain.

A royal piece is one which must not be allowed to be captured. If a royal piece is threatened with capture and cannot avoid capture the next move, then the game is lost (a generalization of checkmate). In orthodox chess, the kings are royal. In fairy chess any other piece may instead be royal, and there may be more than one, or none at all (in which case the winning condition must be some other goal, such as capturing all of the opponent&#x27;s pieces or promoting a pawn). Tamerlane chess and chu shogi allow multiple royals to be created via promotion. With multiple royal pieces the game can be won by capturing one of them (absolute royalty), or capturing all of them (extinction royalty). The rules can also impose a limit to the number of royals that are allowed to be left in check. In Spartan chess, Black has two kings, and they may not &quot;both&quot; be left in check even though they can not both be captured in one turn. In &quot;Rex Multiplex&quot;, a fairy chess condition, pawns can promote to king: a move that checks multiple kings at once is illegal &quot;unless&quot; all the checks can be resolved on the next move; checkmate happens when a move &quot;checkmates&quot; all kings of the opposite colour. (A player may not expose any of their kings to check or checkmate, even if it is to resolve checks or checkmates on other attacked kings.)

Pieces, when moving, can also create effects (temporary or permanent) on themselves or on other pieces. In knight relay chess, a knight grants any friendly piece it protects the ability to move like a knight. This ability is temporary and expires when the piece is no longer protected by a knight. In Andernach chess, a piece that moves or captures changes its colour; in &quot;volage&quot;, a genre of fairy chess problems, a piece changes colour the &quot;first&quot; time it moves from a light square to a dark square (vice versa), after which its colour is fixed. In Madrasi chess, two pieces of the same kind but different colour attacking each other temporarily &quot;paralyse&quot; each other: neither may move until the mutual attack is broken by an outside piece. The &quot;basilisk&quot; from Ralph Betza&#x27;s Nemoroth inflicts a permanent form of this paralysis (but paralysed pieces may be pushed by the &quot;go away&quot;, another piece in the game, so they are only prevented from moving of their own accord); the &quot;ghast&quot; from the same game restricts friendly pieces within two squares of it to moves that take them geometrically further from it, and &quot;compels&quot; enemy pieces to do so (similar to the compulsion of resolving check in orthodox chess). The &quot;immobiliser&quot; from Baroque chess immobilises any piece next to it; the &quot;fire demon&quot; from tenjiku shogi and &quot;poison flame&quot; from ko shogi capture any enemy pieces that end the turn next to them. The &quot;teaching king&quot; and &quot;Buddhist spirit&quot; from maka dai dai shogi are &quot;contagious&quot;; any piece that captures a teaching king or a Buddhist spirit becomes one. (This can be considered as a kind of forced promotion.)

Pieces may promote to other pieces, as the pawn automatically does in orthodox chess on the last rank: the pawn has a choice of what it promotes to. In xiangqi, pawns automatically promote as soon as they cross the river in the middle of the board, but this promotion is fixed and only gives them the power to move sideways as well as forward. In shogi, the pawn is not the only piece that can promote; promotion can occur if a move takes place partly or wholly in the last three ranks from the player&#x27;s viewpoint, and is optional unless the piece could not move further, but a piece&#x27;s promotion is fixed. In dai dai shogi, promotion (again fixed depending on the piece) happens when a piece that can promote makes a capture, and may not be refused.

Pieces may also have restrictions on where they can go. In xiangqi, the &quot;general&quot; and &quot;advisors&quot; may not leave their &quot;palaces&quot; (a 3×3 section of the board for each player). The topology of the board can also be changed, and some pieces may respect it while others ignore it. In Tamerlane chess, only a king, prince, or adventitious king may enter the opponent&#x27;s citadel, and only the adventitious king may enter its &quot;own&quot; citadel. In cylindrical chess, the left and right edges are joined to each other so a rook can continue to the right from h1 and end up on a1. It would be possible to have both cylindrical pieces and normal pieces on the same board.

Pieces may also have restriction on how they can be captured. An iron piece may not be captured at all. There are other possibilities, like a piece that can be captured by &quot;some&quot; pieces but not others, which is common in ko shogi (e.g. a shield unit is invulnerable to bows and guns). In Ralph Betza&#x27;s &quot;Jupiter&quot; army, the Jovian bishop is a Nemesis ferz: it cannot capture, it cannot increase its distance from the enemy king, and it may not be captured (except possibly by the enemy king itself; Betza vacillated on this point).

Such special characteristics of pieces are normally not included in the notations describing the movement of fairy pieces, and are usually explained separately.

=== Higher dimensions ===

Some three-dimensional chess variants also exist, such as Raumschach, along with pieces that take advantage of the extra dimension on the board.


==Notations==

===Parlett&#x27;s movement notation===
In his book &quot;The Oxford History of Board Games&quot; David Parlett used a notation to describe fairy piece movements. The move is specified in the form m={&quot;expression&quot;}, where &quot;m&quot; stands for &quot;move&quot;, and the &quot;expression&quot; is composed from the following elements:
* Distance (numbers, n)
** 1 – a distance of one (i.e. to adjacent square)
** 2 – a distance of two
** n – any distance in the given direction
* Direction (punctuation, X)
** + – orthogonally (four possible directions)
** &gt; – orthogonally forwards
** &lt; – orthogonally backwards
** &lt;&gt; – orthogonally forwards and backwards
** = – orthogonally sideways (used here instead of Parlett&#x27;s divide symbol ÷)
** &gt;= – orthogonally forwards or sideways
** &lt;= – orthogonally backwards or sideways
** X – diagonally (four possible directions)
** X&gt; – diagonally forwards
** X&lt; – diagonally backwards
** – orthogonally or diagonally (all eight possible directions); same as +X; Parlett uses *
* Grouping
** / – two orthogonal moves separated by a slash denote a hippogonal move (i.e. jumps like a knight)
** &amp; – repeated movement in the same direction, such as for hippogonal riders (e.g., the nightrider)
** . – then, (e.g., an aanca is 1X.n+; one step diagonally and &quot;then&quot; any distance orthogonally outwards)

====Additions to Parlett&#x27;s====
The following can be added to Parlett&#x27;s to make it more complete:
* Conditions under which the move may occur (lowercase alphanumeric, except n)
**(default) – May occur at any point in the game
**i – May only be made on the initial move (e.g. pawn&#x27;s 2 moves forward)
**c – May only be made on a capture (e.g. pawn&#x27;s diagonal capture)
**o – May not be used for a capture (e.g. pawn&#x27;s forward move)
* Move type
** (default) – Captures by landing on the piece; blocked by intermediate pieces
**~ – Leaper (leaps); captures by landing on the opposing piece
** ^ – Locust (captures by hopping; implies hopper); capture move is one square past the captured piece
* Grouping (punctuation)
**, (comma) – separates move options; only one of the comma-delimited options may be chosen per move
**() – grouping operator; see nightrider
** - – range operator

The format (not including grouping) is: &lt;conditions&gt; &lt;move type&gt; &lt;distance&gt; &lt;direction&gt; &lt;other&gt;

On this basis, the traditional chess moves (excluding castling and &quot;en passant&quot; capture) are:
* King: 1
* Queen: n
* Bishop: nX
* Rook: n+
* Pawn: o1&gt;, c1X&gt;, oi2&gt;
* Knight: ~1/2

===Ralph Betza&#x27;s &quot;funny notation&quot;===
Ralph Betza created a classification scheme for fairy chess pieces (including standard chess pieces) in terms of the moves of basic pieces with modifiers.

Capital letters stand for basic leap movements, ranging from single-square orthogonal moves to 3×3 diagonal leaps: Wazir, Ferz, Dabbaba, KNight, Alfil, THreeleaper (ortHogonal), Camel, Zebra, and diaGonal (3,3)-leaper. C and Z are equivalent to obsolete letters L (Long Knight) and J (Jump) which are no longer commonly used. Longer leaps are specified here by a vector, such as (1,4) for the giraffe.

A leaper is converted into a rider by doubling its letter. For example, WW describes a rook, FF describes a bishop, and NN describes a nightrider. The second letter can instead be a number, which is a limitation on how many times the leap motion can be repeated; for example, W4 describes a rook limited to 4 spaces of movement. R4 is an old synonym for W4.

Combining multiple movement letters into a string means the piece can use any of the available options. For example, WF describes a king, capable of moving one space orthogonally or diagonally.

Standard chess pieces except pawns (which are particularly complex) and knights (which are a basic leap movement) have their own letters available; K = WF, Q = WWFF, B = FF, R = WW.

All mentioned capitals refer to a maximally symmetric set of moves that can be used for both moving and capturing. Lowercase letters in front of the capital letters modify the component, usually restricting the moves to a subset. They can be distinguished in directional, modal and other modifiers. Basic directional modifiers are: forward, b, right, left. On non-orthogonal moves these indicate pairs of moves, and a second modifier of the perpendicular type is needed to fully specify a single direction. Otherwise, when multiple directions are mentioned, it means that moves in all these directions are possible. The prefix notations sideways and vertical are shorthands for lr and fb, respectively. Modal modifiers are move only, capture only. Other modifiers are jumping (basic distant leap must jump, cannot move without a hurdle), non-jumping like the Chinese elephant, grasshopper (a rider that moves only by landing on the square immediately beyond the first piece it encounters), pao (a rider that moves only by landing any number of squares beyond the first piece it encounters, but not beyond a second piece), o cylindrical (moving off one side of the board wraps to the other), z crooked (moving in a zigzag line like the boyscout), q circular movement (like the rose), and then (for pieces that start moving in one direction and then continue in another, like the gryphon).

In addition, Betza has also suggested adding brackets to his notation: q[WF]q[FW] would be a circular king, which can move from e4 to f5 (first the ferz move) then g5, h4, h3, g2, f2, e3, and back to e4, effectively passing a turn, and could also start from e4 to f4 (first the wazir move) then g5, g6, f7, e7, d6, d5, and back to e4.

Example: The standard chess pawn can be described as mfWcfF (ignoring the initial double move).

There is no standard order of the components and modifiers. Betza often plays with the order to create somehow pronounceable piece names and artistic word play.

Note that this table is a special case of the Cartesian coordinate plane, where the origin is always the &quot;current&quot; location of the piece about to move.

==== Addition to Betza&#x27;s notation (&#x27;XBetza&#x27;)====

Betza does not use the small letter i. It is used here for &quot;initial&quot; in the description of the different types of pawns. The letter a is used here to describe again, indicating the piece can make the move on which it is prefixed multiple times, possibly with new modifiers mentioned behind the a, which then apply to the second &#x27;leg&#x27; of the move. Directional specifications for such a continuation step should be interpreted relative to the first step (e.g. aW is a two-step orthogonal move that can change direction; afW is a two-step orthogonal move that must continue the same direction).

To handle some frequently encountered special moves, e can be used next to m and c to indicate &quot;en-passant&quot; capture, i.e. capture of the piece that just made a move with i &amp; n modifier, by moving to the square where the n implies it could have been blocked. (This makes the full description of the FIDE pawn mfWcefFimfnD.) An O with a range specifier is used to indicate castling with the furthest piece in that direction in the initial setup, the range indicating the number of squares the king moves (orthodox castling: ismO2). XBetza overloads some modifiers, by giving them an alternative meaning where the original meaning makes no sense. E.g. i in a continuation leg (&#x27;iso&#x27;) indicates the length must be the same as the previous riding leg, useful for indicating rifle captures (caibR).

Non-final legs of a multi-leg move also have the option to end on an occupied square without disturbing its contents. To indicate this the modifier p is used, and thus has a slightly different meaning than on final legs; the traditional meaning can then be seen as shorthand for paf. To make the a notation more versatile, it can also be used when the moves of the two legs are not exactly congruent: g is an alternative to indicates a non-final leg to an occupied square, but in contrast to p it specifies a &#x27;range toggle&#x27;, converting a mentioned rider move into the corresponding leaper move (e.g. R ⟷ W) for the next leg, and vice versa (making the traditional g shorthand for gaf). A similar range toggle on reaching an empty square can be indicated by y, to indicate a slider &quot;spontaneously&quot; turns a corner after starting with a leap. Continuation directions will always be encoded in the 8-fold (K) system, even when the initial leg only had 4-fold symmetry. Mention of an intermediate direction on a 4-fold-symmetrical move would then swap orthogonal moves to the corresponding diagonal moves, (e.g. W ⟷ F) and vice versa. (So mafsW is the xiangqi horse, move to an empty W-square, and continue one F-step at 45 degree, and FyafsF is the gryphon.)

Bex notation also adds many extensions for indicating different modes of capture: where a simple c describes replacement capture as in chess, the notations [ca], [cw], [cl] describe capture by approach, withdrawal, leaping over, etc. [crM] describes &quot;rifle capture&quot; (i.e. annihilating enemy pieces without moving), and specifies with the atom M it contains what can be captured that way. Bex notation also introduces a way to describe &quot;exotic effects&quot; as a step in a longer move. E.g. [xo] as final move step indicates returning to the square of origin, [xiK] means &quot;immobilize&quot; all pieces a K step away from the current square, while [x!iK] would similarly mobilize such neighbors. [xwN] would denote a position swap with a piece an N leap away. None of these things can be specified in the original Betza notation, but the downside is that the notations are completely ad-hoc, and do not follow from an underlying principle.

=== Notation used by problemists ===
The British Chess Problem Society (BCPS) provides notations for many fairy chess pieces, extending the standard algebraic notation for chess. The notation consists of one or two capital letters or of one capital letter followed by a digit. It is noteworthy that the notation of the standard Knight is the letter S (from German &quot;Springer&quot;) and the single letter N denotes the Nightrider. The notation for the Wazir is WE (from German &quot;Wesir&quot;) while the notation WA denotes the Waran (Rook + Nightrider).

== Relative value of pieces ==

As with piece values in traditional chess, fairy pieces have values assigned for use in scoring and strategising. While a large amount of information can be found concerning the relative value of variant chess pieces, there are few resources where it is in a concise format for more than just a few piece types. One challenge of producing such a summary is that piece values are dependent upon the size of boards they are played on, and the combination of other pieces on the board; even when the same game format is assumed (board size and combination of other pieces), there is often little agreement on the specific value of many other pieces.

On an 8×8 board, the standard chess pieces (pawn, knight, bishop, rook, and queen) are usually given values of 1, 3, 3, 5, and 9 respectively. When the basic pieces wazir (W), ferz (F), and mann (WF = K) are played with a similar mix of pieces, they are typically valued at around 1, 1.5, and 3 points respectively. Three popular compound pieces, the archbishop (BN), chancellor (RN), and amazon (QN), have been estimated to have point values around 8, 8.5, and 12, respectively. The values of other pieces are not well established; compound pieces are sometimes approximated as the sum of their component pieces, or estimated to be slightly higher due to synergistic effects (such as it is for the archbishop and chancellor).

Musketeer Chess, a modern chess variant, has tried to give relatively accurate values of 10 fairy pieces: Hawk, Elephant, Unicorn, Fortress, Dragon, Spider, Leopard, Cannon, Archbishop, Chancellor. The method that led to these calculations has been based on computation, using a dedicated engine developed. Thousands of games were generated, which helped refine the values that served as a starting point (Musketeer Chess Pieces Relative Value). Other independent approaches have given Musketeer Chess a trial. For example, Sbiis Sabian, in a 24-page article, reviewed many existing methods and came-up with his own methodology, inspired from previous trials. He created a program that generates random chess positions, then calculated average mobility in thousands of positions approximating the relative piece values. Another progress has been the use of powerful engines: an approach presented by Grandmaster Larry Kaufman has allowed the evaluation of the relative piece values in many situations, e.g. the bishop pair.

<text>The CONMEBOL Copa América (; known until 1975 as the South American Football Championship), often simply called the Copa America, is the top men&#x27;s quadrennial football tournament contested among national teams from South America. It is the oldest still-running continental football competition. The competition determines the champions of South America. Since the 1990s, teams from North America and Asia have also been invited to compete.

Eight of the ten CONMEBOL national teams have won the tournament at least once in its 48 stagings since the event&#x27;s inauguration in 1916, with Ecuador and Venezuela the only teams yet to win. Argentina have the most championships in the tournament&#x27;s history, with 16 cups. The country that hosted the tournament the most times (nine editions) is Argentina, including the inaugural edition in 1916. The United States is the only non-CONMEBOL country that hosted the event, having done so in both 2016 and 2024. On three occasions (in 1975, 1979, and 1983), the tournament was held in multiple South American countries.

Since 1993, the tournament has generally featured 12 teams — all 10 CONMEBOL teams and two additional teams from other confederations. Mexico participated in every tournament between 1993 and 2016, with one additional team drawn from CONCACAF, except for 1999, when AFC team Japan filled out the 12-team roster, and 2019, which featured Japan and Qatar. The 2016 and 2024 tournaments both featured 16 teams, with six teams from CONCACAF in addition to the 10 from CONMEBOL.

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===

The first football team in South America, Lima Cricket and Football Club, was established in Peru in 1859, and the Argentine Football Association was founded in 1893. By the early 20th century, football was growing in popularity, and the first international competition held among national teams of the continent occurred in 1910 when Argentina organized an event to commemorate the centenary of the May Revolution. Chile and Uruguay participated, but this event is not considered official by CONMEBOL. Similarly, for the centennial celebration of its independence, Argentina held a tournament between 2 and 17 July 1916 with Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Brazil being the first participants of the tournament. This so-called &quot;Campeonato Sudamericano de Football&quot; would be the first edition of what is currently known as Copa América; Uruguay would triumph in this first edition after tying 0–0 with hosts Argentina in the deciding, last match held in Estadio Racing Club in Avellaneda.

Seeing the success of the tournament, a boardmember of the Uruguayan Football Association, Héctor Rivadavia, proposed the establishment of a confederation of the associations of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. On 9 July, independence day in Argentina, CONMEBOL was founded. The following year, the competition was played again, this time in Uruguay. Uruguay would win the title again to win their &quot;bicampeonato&quot; after defeating Argentina 1–0 in the last match of the tournament. The success of the tournament on &quot;Charrúan&quot; soil would help consolidate the tournament.
After a flu outbreak in Rio de Janeiro canceled the tournament in 1918, Brazil hosted the tournament in 1919 and was crowned champion for the first time after defeating the defending champions 1–0 in a playoff match to decide the title, while the Chilean city of Viña del Mar would host the 1920 event which was won by Uruguay.

For the 1921 event, Paraguay participated for the first time after its football association affiliated to CONMEBOL earlier that same year. Argentina won the competition for the first time thanks to the goals of Julio Libonatti. In subsequent years, Uruguay would dominate the tournament, which at that time was the largest football tournament in the world. Argentina, however, would not be far behind and disputed the supremacy with the &quot;Charruas&quot;. After losing the 1928 final at the 1928 Summer Olympics held in Amsterdam, Argentina would gain revenge in the 1929 South American Championship by defeating the Uruguayans in the last, decisive match. During this period, both Bolivia and Peru debuted in the tournament in 1926 and 1927, respectively.

=== Disorganization and intermittency ===
After the first World Cup held in Uruguay in 1930, the enmity between the football federations of Uruguay and Argentina prevented the competition from being played for a number of years. Only in 1935 was it possible to dispute a special edition of the event to be officially reinstated in 1939. Peru became the host nation of the 1939 edition and won the competition for the first time. Ecuador made their debut at that tournament.

In 1941, Chile hosted that year&#x27;s edition in celebration of the 400th anniversary of the founding of Santiago for which the capacity of the newly built Estadio Nacional was expanded from 30,000 to 70,000 spectators. Despite the large investment and initial success of the team, the Chileans would be defeated in the last match by eventual champions Argentina. Uruguay hosted and won the 1942 edition. Chile would host again in 1945, and came close to playing for the title against Argentina. However, Brazil spoiled that possibility, and Argentina would win the tournament once again on Chilean soil.
The event then entered a period of great disruption. The championship was not played on a regular basis and many editions would be deemed unofficial, only to be considered valid later on by CONMEBOL. For example, Argentina would be the first (and so far only) team to win three consecutive titles by winning the championships of 1945, 1946 and 1947. After those three annual tournaments, the competition returned to being held every two years, then three and later four. There were even two tournaments held in 1959, one in Argentina and a second in Ecuador. During this period, some of the national teams were indifferent to the tournament. Some did not participate every year, others sent lesser teams; in the 1959 edition held in Ecuador, Brazil entered a team from the state of Pernambuco. Bolivia won for the first time when it hosted in 1963, but was defeated in the first game of the 1967 tournament by debutant Venezuela. The founding of the Copa Libertadores in 1959 also affected the way the tournament was viewed by its participants.

After eight years of absence, the event resumed in 1975 and officially acquired the name &quot;Copa América&quot;. The tournament had no fixed venue, and all matches were played throughout the year in each country. Nine teams participated in the group stages with the defending champions receiving a bye into the semifinals. The tournament was contested every four years using this system until 1987.

=== Renewal and host rotation ===

In 1986, CONMEBOL decided to return to having one country host the tournament and to contest it every other year. From 1987 until 2001, the event was hosted every two years in rotation by the ten members of the confederation. The format would remain constant with a first round of groups, but the final round stage ranged from being a new, final round-robin group or a single-elimination system to decide the winner. This renewal helped the tournament, which began to receive television coverage in Europe and North America. The 1987 Copa América was held in Argentina; this was the first time the nation had hosted an edition in 28 years. Despite entering as heavy favorites for being the reigning world champions (having won the 1986 FIFA World Cup), playing at home and having a team largely composed of its World Cup winners led by the legendary Diego Maradona, Argentina would finish in a disappointing fourth place after being beaten by defending champions Uruguay 0–1 in the semifinals. Uruguay would defeat a surprisingly strong Chilean squad who made it to the final, disposing of the powerful Brazil 4–0 on the group stage.

Brazil lifted its first official international title since the 1970 FIFA World Cup upon winning the 1989 Copa América held on home soil. Argentina, in turn, won the Copa América after 32 long years in 1991 in Chile, thanks to a refreshed squad led by the prolific goalscorer Gabriel Batistuta. The 1993 Copa América tournament in Ecuador would take its current form. Along with the usual ten teams, CONMEBOL invited two countries from CONCACAF to participate, Mexico and the United States.

Uruguay managed to win the competition in 1995 as host, ending a period of decline for Uruguayan football. With the implementation of rotating hosts, Colombia, Paraguay and Venezuela hosted the tournament for the first time. Brazil entered a series of victories, winning four of the five continental titles between 1997 and 2007. The first, in 1997, was won after defeating host nation Bolivia 1–3 with goals from Leonardo, Denílson and Ronaldo becoming crucial in the &quot;Verde-Amarela&quot;&#x27;s consecration on Bolivia&#x27;s altitude. Brazil would successfully defend the title in 1999 after thumping Uruguay 3–0 in Asuncion, Paraguay. However, the 2001 Copa América saw one of the biggest surprises of the history of the sport as Honduras eliminated Brazil in the quarterfinals. Colombia, the host nation, would go on to win the competition for the first time ever.
From 2001 to 2007, the tournament was contested every three years, and from 2007 forward every four years, with the exception of the tournament&#x27;s centennial in 2016.

Running from an embarrassing performance in 2001, Brazil reestablished itself in the South American pantheon after defeating Argentina, on penalties, in order to win the 2004 competition held in Peru. Three years later, the two teams met again in the final, this time in Venezuela. Once again, Brazil came out victorious after crushing Argentina 3–0.

Argentina hosted the 2011 competition and was ousted by Uruguay in the quarterfinals by penalty shootout. Uruguay would go on defeating Peru 2–0 in the semis to reach the finals and overpower Paraguay 3–0, thus winning the trophy on Argentinean soil for the third time and second in a row. This, the 43rd edition, was the first time that neither Argentina nor Brazil reached the semifinals of a tournament they both had entered.

The 2015 competition was hosted in Chile, who swapped hosting positions with Brazil in light of the latter&#x27;s hosting of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics. Chile went on to win the tournament, their first title, on home soil.

=== Centenary and beyond ===

In 2016, the centenary of the tournament was celebrated with the Copa América Centenario tournament hosted in the United States; the tournament was the first to be hosted outside of South America and had an expanded field of 16 teams from CONMEBOL and CONCACAF. During the tournament, media outlets reported that CONMEBOL and CONCACAF were negotiating a merger of the Copa América with the CONCACAF Gold Cup, the latter&#x27;s continental tournament held every two years, with the United States hosting regular tournaments; United States Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati called the report inaccurate, saying that no such discussion had taken place and that a new tournament would have to be established. For the second time, Chile won the trophy in a penalty shoot-out. The 2016 edition broke tournament records for attendance, with 1.5 million total spectators and an average of 46,000 per match through the semi-finals.

Brazil hosted the 2019 edition, which was played in the normal four-year cycle, and won their ninth title by defeating Peru in the final at the renovated Maracanã Stadium. CONMEBOL approved a permanent switch from odd to even years beginning with the 2020 Copa América to move in line with the UEFA European Championship, which would be jointly hosted by Argentina and Colombia and split into two groups. The tournament was postponed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lost two invited teams from Asia—Australia and Qatar—due to fixture congestion. Colombia requested that the tournament be moved to November 2021 due to widespread protests and increased COVID-19 cases, but withdrew after CONMEBOL rejected a second postponement. 13 days prior to the opening match, the entire tournament was moved to Brazil due to a rise in COVID-19 cases in Argentina. The 2021 Copa América was played by 10 teams with no spectators at most matches due to the pandemic; the final at the Maracanã was limited to 10 percent of capacity. Argentina won their first title in 28 years by defeating Brazil in the final.

CONMEBOL and CONCACAF signed a collaborative partnership agreement in January 2023 that included the United States being selected as host for the 2024 Copa América, which would feature six CONCACAF teams. The tournament would share some venues with the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which is planned to be co-hosted by the United States.

== Hosts ==

In 1984, CONMEBOL adopted the policy of rotating the right to host the Copa América amongst the ten member confederations. The first rotation was completed following the 2007 Copa América which took place in Venezuela. A second rotation commenced in 2011, with host countries rotating in alphabetical order, starting with Argentina. Chile, Mexico and the United States expressed interest in hosting the next tournament, but the CONMEBOL Executive Committee decided to continue the execution of the rotation, giving priority of the organization to each of its member associations; each association confirms whether they will host an edition or not, having no obligation to do so. Argentina confirmed on 24 November 2008, via representatives of the Argentine Football Association, that it would host the 2011 Copa América.

The 2015 Copa América was due to be held in Brazil following the order of rotation. However, as Brazil was hosting both the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics, the decision was reconsidered. Although CONMEBOL President Nicolas Leoz proposed hosting the continental tournament in Mexico (a member of the CONCACAF federation) and board members Brazil and Chile discussed the possibility of exchanging the 2015 and 2019 tournaments, it was decided and confirmed by the CBF in February 2011 that the 2015 Copa América would remain in Brazil. However, in March 2012, CBF president Ricardo Teixeira resigned from his position and the CBF agreed to swap the tournament&#x27;s hosting with Chile. The swap was made official in May 2012. The centennial edition of the tournament, Copa América Centenario, took place in June 2016, and was held in the United States. The Copa América Centenario marked the first time the tournament was hosted by a non-CONMEBOL nation.

Each Copa América since 2005 has had its own mascot. &quot;Gardelito&quot;, the mascot for the 1987 competition, was the first Copa América mascot.
:&quot;C = non-CONMEBOL host.&quot;

== Format and rules ==
In early tournaments all teams competed in a round-robin stage, while later ones saw the teams were split into different groups followed by a single-elimination knockout stage.

;Notes
The tournament was previously known as &quot;Campeonato Sudamericano de Futbol&quot; (South American Championship of Football). &quot;South American Championship of Nations&quot; was the official English language name. The current name has been used since 1975. Up to 1967 if there was a tie of points at the top of the standings, a playoff match (or matches) would be held to determine the champion. Between 1975 and 1983 it had no fixed host nation, and was held in a home and away fashion. The current final tournament features 12 national teams competing over a month in the host nation. There are two phases: the group stage followed by the knockout stage. In the group stage, teams compete within three groups of four teams each. Three teams are seeded, including the hosts, with the other seeded teams selected using a formula based on the FIFA World Rankings. The other teams are assigned to different &quot;pots&quot;, usually based also on the FIFA Rankings, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the three groups.

Each group plays a round-robin tournament, in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. In earlier tournaments, the last round of matches of each group were not scheduled at the same time unlike many tournaments around the world for unknown reasons, although more recent tournaments have adopted this rule. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Beginning in 1995, three points have been awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss (before, winners received two points).

The ranking of each team in each group is determined as follows:
:a) greatest number of points obtained in all group matches;
:b) goal difference in all group matches;
:c) greatest number of goals scored in all group matches.

If two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above three criteria,
their rankings are determined as follows:
:d) greatest number of points obtained in the group matches between the teams concerned;
:e) goal difference resulting from the group matches between the teams concerned;
:f) greater number of goals scored in all group matches between the teams concerned;
:g) drawing of lots by the CONMEBOL Organizing Committee (i.e. at random).

The knockout stage is a single-elimination tournament in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with penalty shootouts used to decide the winner if a match is still tied after 90 minutes in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, and after extra time in the final. It begins with the quarter-finals, then semi-finals, the third-place match (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.

== Participating teams ==
All registered national federations of CONMEBOL, of which there currently are ten, are eligible for automatic berths in the tournament. Since the competition&#x27;s rebranding in 1975, there has been only one occasion when one of those teams missed out on a tournament: Argentina withdrew from the 2001 edition due to scheduling and security disagreements.

Owing to this somewhat limited number of available participants, countries from other continents have usually been invited to make up the 12 teams necessary for the current tournament format since 1993. Most often those have been from CONCACAF, whose members are geographically and culturally close. For the centennial edition in 2016 and for the one in 2024, reflecting the number of teams being increased to 16, qualification stages were held for the CONCACAF teams.

In all, ten non-South American nations have participated in Copa América at least once: CONCACAF members Canada, Costa Rica, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, and the United States, as well as AFC members Japan and Qatar. Two other teams, China and Australia, had accepted invitations respectively for 2015 and 2021, but both did not end up appearing because of clashes with other commitments. Moreover, Spain was invited to the 2011 edition but declined to participate.

== Trophies ==

The Copa América trophy, which is awarded to the winners of the tournament, was donated to the Association by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Argentina, Ernesto Bosch, in 1910, when Argentina organized an event to commemorate the centenary of the May Revolution. That competition (also attended by Uruguay and Chile) was named &quot;Copa del Centenario&quot; (Centennial Cup).

The current Copa América trophy was purchased in 1916 from &quot;Casa Escasany&quot;, a jewelry shop in Buenos Aires, at the cost of 3,000 Swiss francs.

The Copa América trophy is a weight and tall silver ornament, with a 3-level wooden base which contains several plaques. The plaques are engraved with every winner of the competition, as well as the edition won. The trophy previously had a one- and two-level base , and prior to 1979 there was no base at all, like the one used in 1975.

In April 2016, a commemorative trophy – specifically designed for the Copa América Centenario – was introduced at the Colombian Football Federation headquarters of Bogotá to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the competition. The trophy was based on the original Copa América trophy&#x27;s shape, added with the 2016 edition logo. The trophy was not to have a base. The CAC was tall with a weight of , covered by 24-carat gold. The emblems of CONMEBOL and CONCACAF were also engraved on its body.

The commemorative Copa América Centenario trophy was designed by Epico Studios in the United States and manufactured by London Workshops of Thomas Lyte in England. The winning team will keep the trophy in perpetuity.

Apart from the main trophy, the &quot;Copa Bolivia&quot; (a small trophy made in silver) has been awarded to the runner-up of the competition since the 1997 edition. The trophy is named after the country that hosted the 1997 Copa América, with a small Bolivian flag attached on one of its sides.

<text>Cispius is the &quot;nomen&quot; of the Roman &quot;gens Cispia&quot;.

==Cispius Laevus==

The &quot;Mons Cispius&quot;, or Cispian Hill, is one of several summits of the Esquiline Hill in Rome. The grammarian Festus says that it was named for a Cispius Laevus of Anagnia, of the &quot;Publilia&quot; voting tribe (&quot;tribus&quot;). This Cispius may be legendary.

==Marcus Cispius==

Marcus Cispius was a tribune of the &quot;plebs&quot; in 57 BC, and was among those tribunes who actively supported Cicero in his efforts to overturn the legislation that brought about his exile. Earlier, however, Cicero had brought a civil suit in which he spoke against Cispius, his brother, and their father. Sometime after Cispius&#x27;s tribunate, most likely in early 56, he was defended by Cicero on a charge of electoral corruption (&quot;ambitus&quot;) and convicted. Cicero calls him &quot;a man of character and principle.&quot; The two men maintained their friendship in the 50s; in 55, Cicero wrote a letter of recommendation to the proconsul of Africa, Q. Valerius Orca, on behalf of men associated with Cispius. Cispius may have been a praetor sometime after 54.

==Lucius Cispius (Laevus)==

Lucius Cispius, probably with the &quot;cognomen&quot; Laevus, was a commander of the fleet (&quot;praefectus classis&quot;) in 46 BC, serving under Julius Caesar. He took part in the blockade of Thapsus. Cispius was not of senatorial rank, and has been tentatively linked to a pottery manufacturing family in Arretium. It is possible that he was the son of Marcus Cispius (above), though this filiation would place them on opposite sides in the civil war. In 43, a Cispius Laevus was a legate of Munatius Plancus, carrying dispatches to Rome for him; this man was most likely Caesar&#x27;s naval commander.

<text>John Clare (13 July 1793 – 20 May 1864) was an English poet. The son of a farm labourer, he became known for his celebrations of the English countryside and his sorrows at its disruption. His work underwent major re-evaluation in the late 20th century; he is now often seen as a major 19th-century poet. His biographer Jonathan Bate called Clare &quot;the greatest labouring-class poet that England has ever produced. No one has ever written more powerfully of nature, of a rural childhood, and of the alienated and unstable self.&quot;

==Life==
===Early life===
Clare was born in Helpston, to the north of the city of Peterborough. In his lifetime, the village was in the Soke of Peterborough in Northamptonshire and his memorial calls him &quot;The Northamptonshire Peasant Poet&quot;. Helpston is now part of the City of Peterborough unitary authority.

Clare became an agricultural labourer while still a child, but attended school in Glinton church until he was 12. In his early adult years, Clare became a in The Blue Bell public house and fell in love with Mary Joyce, but her father, a prosperous farmer, forbade them to meet. Later, Clare was a gardener at Burghley House. He enlisted in the militia, tried camp life with Gypsies, and worked in Pickworth, Rutland, as a lime burner in 1817. In the following year, he was obliged to accept parish relief. Malnutrition stemming from childhood may have been the main factor behind his stature and contributed to his poor physical health in later life.

===Early poems===
Clare had bought a copy of James Thomson&#x27;s &quot;The Seasons&quot; and began to write poems and sonnets. In an attempt to hold off his parents&#x27; eviction from their home, Clare offered his poems to a local bookseller, Edward Drury, who sent them to his cousin, John Taylor of the Taylor &amp; Hessey firm, which had published the work of John Keats. Taylor published Clare&#x27;s &quot;Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery&quot; in 1820. The book was highly praised and the next year his &quot;Village Minstrel and Other Poems&quot; appeared. &quot;There was no limit to the applause bestowed upon Clare, unanimous in their admiration of a poetical genius coming before them in the humble garb of a farm labourer.&quot;

===Middle life===
On 16 March 1820, Clare married Martha (&quot;Patty&quot;) Turner, a milkmaid, in the Church of St Peter and St Paul in Great Casterton. An annuity of 15 guineas from the Marquess of Exeter, in whose service he had been, was supplemented by subscription, so that Clare gained £45 a year, a sum far beyond what he had ever earned. Soon, however, his income became insufficient and in 1823 he was nearly penniless. &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Calendar&quot; (1827) met with little success, which was not increased by his hawking it himself. As he worked again in the fields, his health temporarily improved; but he soon became seriously ill. Earl Fitzwilliam presented him with a new cottage and a piece of ground, but Clare could not settle down.

Clare was constantly torn between the two worlds of literary London and his often illiterate neighbours, between a need to write poetry and a need for money to feed and clothe his children. His health began to suffer and he had bouts of depression, which worsened after his sixth child was born in 1830 and as his poetry sold less well. In 1832, his friends and London patrons clubbed together to move the family to a larger cottage with a smallholding in the village of Northborough, not far from Helpston. However, he only felt more alienated there.

Clare&#x27;s last work, the &quot;Rural Muse&quot; (1835), was noticed favourably by Christopher North and other reviewers, but its sales were not enough to support his wife and seven children. Clare&#x27;s mental health began to worsen. His alcohol consumption steadily increased along with dissatisfaction with his own identity and more erratic behaviour. A notable instance was his interruption of a performance of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, in which Clare verbally assaulted Shylock. He was becoming a burden to Patty and his family, and in July 1837, on the recommendation of his publishing friend, John Taylor, Clare went of his own volition (accompanied by a friend of Taylor&#x27;s) to Dr Matthew Allen&#x27;s private asylum High Beach near Loughton, in Epping Forest. Taylor had assured Clare that he would receive the best medical care.

Clare was reported as being &quot;full of many strange delusions&quot;. He believed himself to be a prize fighter and that he had two wives, Patty and Mary. He started to claim he was Lord Byron. Allen wrote about Clare to &quot;The Times&quot; in 1840:
===Religion===
Clare was an Anglican. Whatever he may have felt about liturgy and ministry, and however critical an eye he may have cast on parish life, Clare retained and replicated his father&#x27;s loyalty to the Church of England. He dodged services in his youth and dawdled in the fields during the hours of worship, but he derived much help in later years from members of the clergy. He acknowledged that his father &quot;was brought up in the communion of the Church of England, and I have found no cause to withdraw myself from it.&quot; If he found aspects of the established church uncongenial and awkward, he remained prepared to defend it: &quot;Still I reverence the church and do from my soul as much as anyone curse the hand that&#x27;s lifted to undermine its constitution.&quot;

Much of Clare&#x27;s imagery was drawn from the Old Testament (e.g. &quot;The Peasant Poet&quot;). However, Clare also honours the figure of Christ in poems such as &quot;The Stranger&quot;.

===Later life===

During his early asylum years in High Beach, Essex (1837–1841), Clare re-wrote poems and sonnets by Lord Byron. &quot;Child Harold&quot;, his version of Byron&#x27;s &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;, became a lament for past lost love, and &quot;Don Juan, A Poem&quot; an acerbic, misogynistic, sexualised rant redolent of an ageing dandy. Clare also took credit for Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, claiming to be him. &quot;I&#x27;m John Clare now,&quot; the poet told a newspaper editor, &quot;I was Byron and Shakespeare formerly.&quot;

In July 1841, Clare absconded from the asylum in Essex and walked some home, believing he was to meet his first love Mary Joyce, to whom he was convinced he was married. He did not believe her family when they told him she had died accidentally three years earlier in a house fire. He remained free, mostly at home in Northborough, for the five months following, but eventually Patty called the doctors.

Between Christmas and New Year, 1841, Clare was committed to Northampton General Lunatic Asylum (now St Andrew&#x27;s Hospital). On his arrival at the asylum, the accompanying doctor, Fenwick Skrimshire, having treated Clare since 1820, completed the admission papers. Asked, &quot;Was the insanity preceded by any severe or long-continued mental emotion or exertion?&quot; Skrimshire entered: &quot;After years of poetical prosing.&quot;

His maintenance at the asylum was paid for by Earl Fitzwilliam, &quot;but at the ordinary rate for poor people&quot;. He remained there for the rest of his life under the humane regime of Thomas Octavius Prichard, who encouraged and helped him to write. Here he wrote possibly his most famous poem, &quot;I Am&quot;. It was in this later poetry that Clare &quot;developed a very distinctive voice, an unmistakable intensity and vibrance, such as the later pictures of Van Gogh&quot; possessed.

John Clare died of a stroke on 20 May 1864, in his 71st year. His remains were returned to Helpston for burial in St Botolph&#x27;s churchyard, where he had expressed a wish to be buried.

===Remembrance===
On Clare&#x27;s birthday, children at the John Clare School, Helpston&#x27;s primary, parade through the village and place their &quot;midsummer cushions&quot; around his gravestone, which bears the inscriptions &quot;To the Memory of John Clare The Northamptonshire Peasant Poet&quot; and &quot;A Poet is Born not Made&quot;.

==Poetry==

In his time, Clare was commonly known as &quot;the Northamptonshire Peasant Poet&quot;. His formal education was brief, his other employment and class origins lowly. Clare resisted the use of the increasingly standardised English grammar and orthography in his poetry and prose, alluding to political reasoning in comparing &quot;grammar&quot; (in a wider sense of orthography) to tyrannical government and slavery, personifying it in jocular fashion as a &quot;bitch&quot;. He wrote in Northamptonshire dialect, introducing local words to the literary canon such as &quot;pooty&quot; (snail), &quot;lady-cow&quot; (ladybird), &quot;crizzle&quot; (to crisp) and &quot;throstle&quot; (song thrush).

In early life, he struggled to find a place for his poetry in the changing literary fashions of the day. He also felt that he did not belong with other peasants. As Clare once wrote:

It is common to see an absence of punctuation in Clare&#x27;s original writings, although many publishers felt the need to remedy this in most of his work. Clare argued with his editors about how it should be presented to the public.

Clare grew up in a time of massive changes in town and countryside as the Industrial Revolution swept Europe. Many former agricultural and craft workers, including children, moved from the countryside to crowded cities, as factory work mechanized. The Agricultural Revolution saw pastures ploughed up, trees and hedges uprooted, fens drained and commons enclosed. This destruction of an ancient way of life distressed Clare. His political and social views were mainly conservative. (&quot;I am as far as my politics reaches &#x27;King and Country&#x27; – no Innovations in Religion and Government say I.&quot;) He refused even to complain of the subordinate position to which English society had placed him, swearing that &quot;with the old dish that was served to my forefathers I am content.&quot;

His early work expresses delight in nature and the cycle of the rural year. Poems such as &quot;Winter Evening&quot;, &quot;Haymaking&quot; and &quot;Wood Pictures in Summer&quot; mark the beauty of the world and the certainties of rural life, where animals must be fed and crops harvested. Poems such as &quot;Little Trotty Wagtail&quot; show his sharp observation of wildlife, though &quot;The Badger&quot; shows a lack of sentiment about the place of animals in the countryside. At this time he often used poetic forms such as the sonnet and the rhyming couplet. His later poetry tends to be more meditative and use forms similar to the folk songs and ballads of his youth. An example of this is &quot;Evening&quot;.

Clare&#x27;s knowledge of the natural world went far beyond that of the major Romantic poets. However, poems such as &quot;I Am&quot; show a metaphysical depth parallel with his contemporary poets and many of his pre-asylum poems deal with intricate play on the nature of linguistics. His &quot;bird&#x27;s nest poems&quot;, it can be argued, display the self-awareness and obsession with the creative process that captivated the romantics. Clare was the most influential poet, apart from Wordsworth, to prefer an older style.

In a foreword to the 2011 anthology &quot;The Poetry of Birds&quot;, the broadcaster and bird-watcher Tim Dee notes that Clare wrote about 147 species of British wild birds &quot;without any technical kit whatsoever&quot;.

==Essays==
The only Clare essay to appear in his lifetime was &quot;Popularity of Authorship&quot;, which described anonymously his predicament in 1824. Other essays by Clare to appear posthumously were &quot;Essays on Landscape&quot;, &quot;Essays on Criticism and Fashion&quot;, &quot;Recollections on a Journey from Essex&quot;, &quot;Excursions with an Angler&quot;, &quot;For Essay on Modesty and Mock Morals&quot;, &quot;For Essay on Industry&quot;, &quot;Keats&quot;, &quot;Byron&quot;, &quot;The Dream&quot;, &quot;House or Window Flies&quot; and &quot;Dewdrops&quot;.

==Revived interest==
Clare was relatively forgotten in the later 19th century, but interest in his work was revived by Arthur Symons in 1908, Edmund Blunden in 1920 and John and Anne Tibble in their ground-breaking 1935 two-volume edition, while in 1949 Geoffrey Grigson edited &quot;Poems of John Clare&#x27;s Madness&quot; (published by Routledge and Kegan Paul). Benjamin Britten set some of &quot;May&quot; from &quot;A Shepherd&#x27;s Calendar&quot; in his &quot;Spring Symphony&quot; of 1948 and included a setting of &quot;The Evening Primrose&quot; in his &quot;Five Flower Songs&quot;.

Copyright on much of his work was claimed after 1965 by Professor Eric Robinson, the editor of the &quot;Complete Poetry&quot;, but this has been contested. Some publishers such as Faber and Carcanet Press refused to acknowledge it. Robinson died in 2019 and neither his widow nor his literary agent maintain his claim to own the copyright.

The largest collection of original Clare manuscripts is held at Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery, where items are available to view by appointment. Other Clare papers are in public libraries in Northampton and New York.

Altering what Clare actually wrote continued into the later 20th century. Helen Gardner, for instance, amended both the punctuation and the spelling and grammar when editing the &quot;New Oxford Book of English Verse 1250–1950&quot; (1972).

Since 1993, the John Clare Society of North America has organised an annual session of scholarly papers concerning John Clare at the annual Convention of the Modern Language Association of America. In 2003 the scholar Jonathan Bate published the first major critical biography of Clare, which helped to keep up the revival in popular and academic interest.

==John Clare Cottage==

The thatched cottage where Clare was born was bought by the John Clare Trust in 2005. In May 2007, the Trust gained £1.27 million of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund and commissioned Jefferson Sheard Architects to create a new landscape design and visitor centre, including a cafe, shop and exhibition area. The cottage at 12 Woodgate, Helpston, has been restored using traditional building methods and is open to the public. In 2013, the John Clare Trust received a further grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to help preserve the building and provide educational activities for youngsters visiting it.

== John Clare and music ==
Clare&#x27;s father was, according to Clare, a &#x27;noted singer&#x27;, and Clare himself played the fiddle and collected folk songs and tunes. Regarding his fiddle playing ability, he described himself as &quot;a decent scraper&quot;, and collected over two-hundred folk tunes in two books, the &quot;Northampton Manuscripts Nos. 12 and 13&quot;.

As well as collecting folk tunes, Clare also collected many folk songs which are recorded in the &quot;Northampton Manuscript No. 18&quot;, and the &quot;Peterborough Manuscripts B4 and B7&quot;. According to George Deacon, the &quot;Northampton Manuscript No. 18&quot; contains &quot;more polished and refined versions&quot; of songs which were originally written up in a rougher form in the two &quot;Peterborough Manuscripts, B4 and B7&quot;. Deacon&#x27;s research led him to view the two Peterborough manuscripts as more authentic, inasmuch as they showed, &quot;less conscious interference from the poet in Clare&quot; than the versions of the songs in the Northampton manuscript.

Since Clare&#x27;s death, many of his poems have been set to music by classical composers, and, more recently, by contemporary singer/songwriters working in the acoustic and folk genres. However, at least one of Clare&#x27;s poems was set to music in his lifetime, although Clare arrived in London too late to attend the performance. According to Professor Simon Kövesi, &quot;&quot;The Meeting&quot; ... [was] Clare&#x27;s first poem to be set to music and performed on stage. The performance by singer Madame Vestris was at Drury Lane Theatre on 19 February 1820; the song was threaded into the pasticcio opera &quot;The Siege of Belgrade&quot;. Clare just missed the show, arriving in London for his first visit to the capital a short while after. Clare wrote that &#x27;on the night we got into London it was in the Play Bills that a song of mine was to be sung at Covent Garden by Madam Vestris and we was to have gone but it was too late. I felt uncommonly at the circumstance&#x27;.&quot;

=== Songs and tunes collected by Clare in the Northampton Catalogue ===

<doc id="250679" wikidata="Q337505" url="?curid=250679" title="Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset">
<text>Lionel Cranfield Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset (18 January 168810 October 1765) was an English peer and politician who served as Lord President of the Council from 1745 to 1751. He also twice served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1730 to 1737 and again from 1750 to 1755.

==Life==
He was the son of the 6th Earl of Dorset and 1st Earl of Middlesex, and the former Lady Mary Compton, younger daughter of the 3rd Earl of Northampton. Styled Lord Buckhurst from birth, he succeeded his father as 7th Earl of Dorset and 2nd Earl of Middlesex in 1706, and was created Duke of Dorset in 1720.

Perhaps because he had been on a previous diplomatic mission to Hanover, he was chosen to inform George I of his accession to the Crown in August 1714. George I initially favoured him and numerous offices and honours were given to him: Privy Councillor, Knight of the Garter, Groom of the Stole, Lord Steward, Governor of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports. At George I&#x27;s coronation he carried the sceptre: at the coronation of George II he was Lord High Steward and carried St Edward&#x27;s Crown. He quarrelled with the King in 1717 and was told his services were no longer required, but was made a duke three years later.

===Lord Lieutenant of Ireland===

Dorset served twice as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, from 1731 to 1737 and again from 1751 to 1755. In 1739, at the foundation of the Foundling Hospital, he was one of that charity&#x27;s original governors. His first term as Lord Lieutenant was uneventful. His second took place at a time of acute political tension between the two main factions in the Irish Government, one led by Henry Boyle, the Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, the other by George Stone, the Anglican Archbishop of Armagh. Dorset, now heavily influenced by his son George Sackville, made the mistake of openly backing the Archbishop. He was unable to oust Boyle from power, and was accused of being the Archbishop&#x27;s tool. He became extremely unpopular, leading to his eventual recall. 

The current O&#x27;Connell Street in Dublin was named in his honour Sackville Street until 1924.

===Last years===
His last years were uneventful, apart from a riot in 1757 caused by the passage of the Militia Act to raise an army for the Seven Years&#x27; War, in which he narrowly escaped injury. He died at Knole on 9 October 1765 and was buried at Withyham in Sussex.

==Character==

Horace Walpole gave this sketch of his character: &quot;with the greatest dignity in his appearance, he was in private the greatest lover of buffoonery and low company... he was never thought to have wanted a tendency to power, in whatever hands it was, or was likely to be&quot;. Jonathan Swift thought him one of the most agreeable and well-informed men, and best conversationalists, he had ever met. Even harsh critics admitted his dignity and perfect decorum, a last legacy of the manners of the Court of Queen Anne.

==Family==
He married Elizabeth Colyear, the daughter of Lieutenant-General Walter Colyear (brother of the David Colyear, 1st Earl of Portmore), in January 1709. She later became a Lady of the Bedchamber (1714–1737) and Mistress of the Robes (1723–1731) to Caroline of Ansbach, wife of George II.

Lionel and Elizabeth&#x27;s sons were:

*Charles, Earl of Middlesex (later 2nd Duke of Dorset)
*Lord John Sackville (father of John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset)
*Lord George Sackville (later Lord George Germain and 1st Viscount Sackville)

They also had two daughters:

*Elizabeth, who married Thomas Thynne, 2nd Viscount Weymouth
* Caroline, who married Joseph Damer, 1st Earl of Dorchester.
