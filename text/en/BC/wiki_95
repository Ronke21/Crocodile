<text>In programming language theory and proof theory, the Curry–Howard correspondence is the direct relationship between computer programs and mathematical proofs. It is also known as the Curry–Howard isomorphism or equivalence, or the proofs-as-programs and propositions- or formulae-as-types interpretation. 

It is a generalization of a syntactic analogy between systems of formal logic and computational calculi that was first discovered by the American mathematician Haskell Curry and the logician William Alvin Howard. It is the link between logic and computation that is usually attributed to Curry and Howard, although the idea is related to the operational interpretation of intuitionistic logic given in various formulations by L. E. J. Brouwer, Arend Heyting and Andrey Kolmogorov (see Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation) and Stephen Kleene (see Realizability). The relationship has been extended to include category theory as the three-way Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence.

== Origin, scope, and consequences == 

The beginnings of the Curry–Howard correspondence lie in several observations:
# In 1934 Curry observes that the types of the combinators could be seen as axiom-schemes for intuitionistic implicational logic.
# In 1958 he observes that a certain kind of proof system, referred to as Hilbert-style deduction systems, coincides on some fragment with the typed fragment of a standard model of computation known as combinatory logic.
# In 1969 Howard observes that another, more &quot;high-level&quot; proof system, referred to as natural deduction, can be directly interpreted in its intuitionistic version as a typed variant of the model of computation known as lambda calculus.

The Curry–Howard correspondence is the observation that there is an isomorphism between the proof systems, and the models of computation. It is the statement that these two families of formalisms can be considered as identical.

If one abstracts on the peculiarities of either formalism, the following generalization arises: &quot;a proof is a program, and the formula it proves is the type for the program&quot;. More informally, this can be seen as an analogy that states that the return type of a function (i.e., the type of values returned by a function) is analogous to a logical theorem, subject to hypotheses corresponding to the types of the argument values passed to the function; and that the program to compute that function is analogous to a proof of that theorem. This sets a form of logic programming on a rigorous foundation: &quot;proofs can be represented as programs, and especially as lambda terms&quot;, or &quot;proofs can be run&quot;.

The correspondence has been the starting point of a large range of new research after its discovery, leading to a new class of formal systems designed to act both as a proof system and as a typed programming language based on functional programming. This includes Martin-Löf&#x27;s intuitionistic type theory and Coquand&#x27;s calculus of constructions (CoC), two calculi in which proofs are regular objects of the discourse and in which one can state properties of proofs the same way as of any program. This field of research is usually referred to as modern type theory.

Such typed lambda calculi derived from the Curry–Howard paradigm led to software like Coq in which proofs seen as programs can be formalized, checked, and run.

A converse direction is to &quot;use a program to extract a proof&quot;, given its correctness—an area of research closely related to proof-carrying code. This is only feasible if the programming language the program is written for is very richly typed: the development of such type systems has been partly motivated by the wish to make the Curry–Howard correspondence practically relevant.

The Curry–Howard correspondence also raised new questions regarding the computational content of proof concepts that were not covered by the original works of Curry and Howard. In particular, classical logic has been shown to correspond to the ability to manipulate the continuation of programs and the symmetry of sequent calculus to express the duality between the two evaluation strategies known as call-by-name and call-by-value.

Because of the possibility of writing non-terminating programs, Turing-complete models of computation (such as languages with arbitrary recursive functions) must be interpreted with care, as naive application of the correspondence leads to an inconsistent logic. The best way of dealing with arbitrary computation from a logical point of view is still an actively debated research question, but one popular approach is based on using monads to segregate provably terminating from potentially non-terminating code (an approach that also generalizes to much richer models of computation, and is itself related to modal logic by a natural extension of the Curry–Howard isomorphism). A more radical approach, advocated by total functional programming, is to eliminate unrestricted recursion (and forgo Turing completeness, although still retaining high computational complexity), using more controlled corecursion wherever non-terminating behavior is actually desired.

==General formulation==
In its more general formulation, the Curry–Howard correspondence is a correspondence between formal proof calculi and type systems for models of computation. In particular, it splits into two correspondences. One at the level of formulas and types that is independent of which particular proof system or model of computation is considered, and one at the level of proofs and programs which, this time, is specific to the particular choice of proof system and model of computation considered.

At the level of formulas and types, the correspondence says that implication behaves the same as a function type, conjunction as a &quot;product&quot; type (this may be called a tuple, a struct, a list, or some other term depending on the language), disjunction as a sum type (this type may be called a union), the false formula as the empty type and the true formula as a unit type (whose sole member is the null object). Quantifiers correspond to dependent function space or products (as appropriate). 
This is summarized in the following table:

At the level of proof systems and models of computations, the correspondence mainly shows the identity of structure, first, between some particular formulations of systems known as Hilbert-style deduction system and combinatory logic, and, secondly, between some particular formulations of systems known as natural deduction and lambda calculus.

Between the natural deduction system and the lambda calculus there are the following correspondences:

== Corresponding systems ==

===Intuitionistic Hilbert-style deduction systems and typed combinatory logic===
It was at the beginning a simple remark in Curry and Feys&#x27;s 1958 book on combinatory logic: the simplest types for the basic combinators K and S of combinatory logic surprisingly corresponded to the respective axiom schemes &quot;α&quot; → (&quot;β&quot; → &quot;α&quot;) and (&quot;α&quot; → (&quot;β&quot; → &quot;γ&quot;)) → ((&quot;α&quot; → &quot;β&quot;) → (&quot;α&quot; → &quot;γ&quot;)) used in Hilbert-style deduction systems. For this reason, these schemes are now often called axioms K and S. Examples of programs seen as proofs in a Hilbert-style logic are given below.

If one restricts to the implicational intuitionistic fragment, a simple way to formalize logic in Hilbert&#x27;s style is as follows. Let Γ be a finite collection of formulas, considered as hypotheses. Then δ is &quot;derivable&quot; from Γ, denoted Γ ⊢ δ, in the following cases:

* δ is an hypothesis, i.e. it is a formula of Γ,
* δ is an instance of an axiom scheme; i.e., under the most common axiom system:
** δ has the form &quot;α&quot; → (&quot;β&quot; → &quot;α&quot;), or
** δ has the form (&quot;α&quot; → (&quot;β&quot; → &quot;γ&quot;)) → ((&quot;α&quot; → &quot;β&quot;) → (&quot;α&quot; → &quot;γ&quot;)),
* δ follows by deduction, i.e., for some &quot;α&quot;, both &quot;α&quot; → &quot;δ&quot; and &quot;α&quot; are already derivable from Γ (this is the rule of modus ponens)

This can be formalized using inference rules, as in the left column of the following table.

Typed combinatory logic can be formulated using a similar syntax: let Γ be a finite collection of variables, annotated with their types. A term T (also annotated with its type) will depend on these variables [Γ ⊢ T:&quot;δ&quot;] when:

* T is one of the variables in Γ,
* T is a basic combinator; i.e., under the most common combinator basis:
** T is K:&quot;α&quot; → (&quot;β&quot; → &quot;α&quot;) [where &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; denote the types of its arguments], or
** T is S:(&quot;α&quot; → (&quot;β&quot; → &quot;γ&quot;)) → ((&quot;α&quot; → &quot;β&quot;) → (&quot;α&quot; → &quot;γ&quot;)),
* T is the composition of two subterms which depend on the variables in Γ.

The generation rules defined here are given in the right-column below. Curry&#x27;s remark simply states that both columns are in one-to-one correspondence. The restriction of the correspondence to intuitionistic logic means that some classical tautologies, such as Peirce&#x27;s law ((&quot;α&quot; → &quot;β&quot;) → &quot;α&quot;) → &quot;α&quot;, are excluded from the correspondence.

Seen at a more abstract level, the correspondence can be restated as shown in the following table. Especially, the deduction theorem specific to Hilbert-style logic matches the process of abstraction elimination of combinatory logic.

Thanks to the correspondence, results from combinatory logic can be transferred to Hilbert-style logic and vice versa. For instance, the notion of reduction of terms in combinatory logic can be transferred to Hilbert-style logic and it provides a way to canonically transform proofs into other proofs of the same statement. One can also transfer the notion of normal terms to a notion of normal proofs, expressing that the hypotheses of the axioms never need to be all detached (since otherwise a simplification can happen).

Conversely, the non provability in intuitionistic logic of Peirce&#x27;s law can be transferred back to combinatory logic: there is no typed term of combinatory logic that is typable with type 
:((&quot;α&quot; → &quot;β&quot;) → &quot;α&quot;) → &quot;α&quot;.

Results on the completeness of some sets of combinators or axioms can also be transferred. For instance, the fact that the combinator X constitutes a one-point basis of (extensional) combinatory logic implies that the single axiom scheme
:(((&quot;α&quot; → (&quot;β&quot; → &quot;γ&quot;)) → ((&quot;α&quot; → &quot;β&quot;) → (&quot;α&quot; → &quot;γ&quot;))) → ((&quot;δ&quot; → (&quot;ε&quot; → &quot;δ&quot;)) → &quot;ζ&quot;)) → &quot;ζ&quot;,
which is the principal type of X, is an adequate replacement to the combination of the axiom schemes 
:&quot;α&quot; → (&quot;β&quot; → &quot;α&quot;) and
:(&quot;α&quot; → (&quot;β&quot; → &quot;γ&quot;)) → ((&quot;α&quot; → &quot;β&quot;) → (&quot;α&quot; → &quot;γ&quot;)).

===Intuitionistic Natural deduction and typed lambda calculus===
After Curry emphasized the syntactic correspondence between intuitionistic Hilbert-style deduction and typed combinatory logic, Howard made explicit in 1969 a syntactic analogy between the programs of simply typed lambda calculus and the proofs of natural deduction. Below, the left-hand side formalizes intuitionistic implicational natural deduction as a calculus of sequents (the use of sequents is standard in discussions of the Curry–Howard isomorphism as it allows the deduction rules to be stated more cleanly) with implicit weakening and the right-hand side shows the typing rules of lambda calculus. In the left-hand side, Γ, Γ1 and Γ2 denote ordered sequences of formulas while in the right-hand side, they denote sequences of named (i.e., typed) formulas with all names different.

To paraphrase the correspondence, proving Γ ⊢ &quot;α&quot; means having a program that, given values with the types listed in Γ, manufactures an object of type &quot;α&quot;. An axiom/hypothesis corresponds to the introduction of a new variable with a new, unconstrained type, the rule corresponds to function abstraction and the rule corresponds to function application. Observe that the correspondence is not exact if the context Γ is taken to be a set of formulas as, e.g., the λ-terms λ&quot;x&quot;.λ&quot;y&quot;.&quot;x&quot; and λ&quot;x&quot;.λ&quot;y&quot;.&quot;y&quot; of type would not be distinguished in the correspondence. Examples are given below.

Howard showed that the correspondence extends to other connectives of the logic and other constructions of simply typed lambda calculus. Seen at an abstract level, the correspondence can then be summarized as shown in the following table. Especially, it also shows that the notion of normal forms in lambda calculus matches Prawitz&#x27;s notion of normal deduction in natural deduction, from which it follows that the algorithms for the type inhabitation problem can be turned into algorithms for deciding intuitionistic provability.

Howard&#x27;s correspondence naturally extends to other extensions of natural deduction and simply typed lambda calculus. Here is a non-exhaustive list:

* Girard-Reynolds System F as a common language for both second-order propositional logic and polymorphic lambda calculus,
* higher-order logic and Girard&#x27;s System Fω
* inductive types as algebraic data type
* necessity formula_1 in modal logic and staged computation
* possibility formula_2 in modal logic and monadic types for effects
* The calculus (where abstraction is restricted to &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;E&quot; where &quot;x&quot; has at least one free occurrence in &quot;E)&quot; and CLI calculus correspond to relevant logic.
* The local truth (∇) modality in Grothendieck topology or the equivalent &quot;lax&quot; modality (◯) of Benton, Bierman, and de Paiva (1998) correspond to CL-logic describing &quot;computation types&quot;.

===Classical logic and control operators===
At the time of Curry, and also at the time of Howard, the proofs-as-programs correspondence concerned only intuitionistic logic, i.e. a logic in which, in particular, Peirce&#x27;s law was &quot;not&quot; deducible. The extension of the correspondence to Peirce&#x27;s law and hence to classical logic became clear from the work of Griffin on typing operators that capture the evaluation context of a given program execution so that this evaluation context can be later on reinstalled. The basic Curry–Howard-style correspondence for classical logic is given below. Note the correspondence between the double-negation translation used to map classical proofs to intuitionistic logic and the continuation-passing-style translation used to map lambda terms involving control to pure lambda terms. More particularly, call-by-name continuation-passing-style translations relates to Kolmogorov&#x27;s double negation translation and call-by-value continuation-passing-style translations relates to a kind of double-negation translation due to Kuroda.

A finer Curry–Howard correspondence exists for classical logic if one defines classical logic not by adding an axiom such as Peirce&#x27;s law, but by allowing several conclusions in sequents. In the case of classical natural deduction, there exists a proofs-as-programs correspondence with the typed programs of Parigot&#x27;s λμ-calculus.

===Sequent calculus===
A proofs-as-programs correspondence can be settled for the formalism known as Gentzen&#x27;s sequent calculus but it is not a correspondence with a well-defined pre-existing model of computation as it was for Hilbert-style and natural deductions.

Sequent calculus is characterized by the presence of left introduction rules, right introduction rule and a cut rule that can be eliminated. The structure of sequent calculus relates to a calculus whose structure is close to the one of some abstract machines. The informal correspondence is as follows:

==Related proofs-as-programs correspondences==

===The role of de Bruijn===

N. G. de Bruijn used the lambda notation for representing proofs of the theorem checker Automath, and represented propositions as &quot;categories&quot; of their proofs. It was in the late 1960s at the same period of time Howard wrote his manuscript; de Bruijn was likely unaware of Howard&#x27;s work, and stated the correspondence independently (Sørensen &amp; Urzyczyn [1998] 2006, pp 98–99). Some researchers tend to use the term Curry–Howard–de Bruijn correspondence in place of Curry–Howard correspondence.

===BHK interpretation===

The BHK interpretation interprets intuitionistic proofs as functions but it does not specify the class of functions relevant for the interpretation. If one takes lambda calculus for this class of function, then the BHK interpretation tells the same as Howard&#x27;s correspondence between natural deduction and lambda calculus.

===Realizability===

Kleene&#x27;s recursive realizability splits proofs of intuitionistic arithmetic into the pair of a recursive function and of
a proof of a formula expressing that the recursive function &quot;realizes&quot;, i.e. correctly instantiates the disjunctions and existential quantifiers of the initial formula so that the formula gets true.

Kreisel&#x27;s modified realizability applies to intuitionistic higher-order predicate logic and shows that the simply typed lambda term inductively extracted from the proof realizes the initial formula. In the case of propositional logic, it coincides with Howard&#x27;s statement: the extracted lambda term is the proof itself (seen as an untyped lambda term) and the realizability statement is a paraphrase of the fact that the extracted lambda term has the type that the formula means (seen as a type).

Gödel&#x27;s dialectica interpretation realizes (an extension of) intuitionistic arithmetic with computable functions. The connection with lambda calculus is unclear, even in the case of natural deduction.

===Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence===
Joachim Lambek showed in the early 1970s that the proofs of intuitionistic propositional logic and the combinators of typed combinatory logic share a common equational theory, the theory of cartesian closed categories. The expression Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence is now used by some people to refer to the relationships between intuitionistic logic, typed lambda calculus and cartesian closed categories. Under this correspondence, objects of a cartesian-closed category can be interpreted as propositions (types), and morphisms as deductions mapping a set of assumptions (typing context) to a valid consequent (well-typed term).

Lambek&#x27;s correspondence is a correspondence of equational theories, abstracting away from dynamics of computation such as beta reduction and term normalization, and is not the expression of a syntactic identity of structures as it is the case for each of Curry&#x27;s and Howard&#x27;s correspondences: i.e. the structure of a well-defined morphism in a cartesian-closed category is not comparable to the structure of a proof of the corresponding judgment in either Hilbert-style logic or natural deduction. For example, it is not possible to state or prove that a morphism is normalizing, establish a Church-Rosser type theorem, or speak of a &quot;strongly normalizing&quot; cartesian closed category. To clarify this distinction, the underlying syntactic structure of cartesian closed categories is rephrased below.

Objects (propositions/types) include
* formula_3 as an object
* given formula_4 and formula_5 as objects, then formula_6 and formula_7 as objects.

Morphisms (deductions/terms) include
* identities: formula_8
* composition: if formula_9 and formula_10 are morphisms formula_11 is a morphism
* terminal morphisms: formula_12
* products: if formula_9 and formula_14 are morphisms, formula_15 is a morphism
* projections: formula_16 and formula_17
* evaluation: formula_18
* currying: if formula_19 is a morphism, formula_20 is a morphism.

Equivalently to the annotations above, well-defined morphisms (typed terms) in any cartesian-closed category can be constructed according to the following typing rules. The usual categorical morphism notation formula_21 is replaced with typing context notation formula_22.

Identity:
:formula_23

Composition:
:formula_24

Unit type (terminal object):
:formula_25

Cartesian product:
:formula_26

Left and right projection:
:formula_27

Currying:
:formula_28

Application:
:formula_29

Finally, the equations of the category are
* formula_30
* formula_31
* formula_32
* formula_33 (if well-typed)
* formula_34
* formula_35
* formula_36
* formula_37
* formula_38
* formula_39
* formula_40
* formula_41

These equations imply the following formula_42-laws:
* formula_43
* formula_44

Now, there exists such that formula_45 iff formula_46 is provable in implicational intuitionistic logic.

==Examples==
Thanks to the Curry–Howard correspondence, a typed expression whose type corresponds to a logical formula is analogous to a proof of that formula. Here are examples.

===The identity combinator seen as a proof of &quot;α&quot; → &quot;α&quot; in Hilbert-style logic===
As an example, consider a proof of the theorem . In lambda calculus, this is the type of the identity function and in combinatory logic, the identity function is obtained by applying S = &quot;λfgx&quot;.&quot;fx&quot;(&quot;gx&quot;) twice to K = &quot;λxy&quot;.&quot;x&quot;. That is, . As a description of a proof, this says that the following steps can be used to prove :

* instantiate the second axiom scheme with the formulas , and to obtain a proof of ,
* instantiate the first axiom scheme once with and to obtain a proof of ,
* instantiate the first axiom scheme a second time with and to obtain a proof of ,
* apply modus ponens twice to obtain a proof of 

In general, the procedure is that whenever the program contains an application of the form (&quot;P&quot; &quot;Q&quot;), these steps should be followed:
# First prove theorems corresponding to the types of &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;. 
# Since &quot;P&quot; is being applied to &quot;Q&quot;, the type of &quot;P&quot; must have the form and the type of &quot;Q&quot; must have the form for some and . Therefore, it is possible to detach the conclusion, , via the modus ponens rule.

===The composition combinator seen as a proof of (&quot;β&quot; → &quot;α&quot;) → (&quot;γ&quot; → &quot;β&quot;) → &quot;γ&quot; → &quot;α&quot; in Hilbert-style logic===
As a more complicated example, let&#x27;s look at the theorem that corresponds to the B function. The type of B is . B is equivalent to (S (K S) K). This is our roadmap for the proof of the theorem .

The first step is to construct (K S). To make the antecedent of the K axiom look like the S axiom, set equal to , and equal to (to avoid variable collisions):
:

Since the antecedent here is just S, the consequent can be detached using Modus Ponens:

This is the theorem that corresponds to the type of (K S). Now apply S to this expression. Taking S as follows

put , , and , yielding

and then detach the consequent:

This is the formula for the type of (S (K S)). A special case of this theorem has :

This last formula must be applied to K. Specialize K again, this time by replacing with and with :
:

This is the same as the antecedent of the prior formula so, detaching the consequent:

Switching the names of the variables and gives us

which was what remained to prove.

===The normal proof of (&quot;β&quot; → &quot;α&quot;) → (&quot;γ&quot; → &quot;β&quot;) → &quot;γ&quot; → &quot;α&quot; in natural deduction seen as a &quot;λ&quot;-term===
The diagram below gives proof of in natural deduction and shows how it can be interpreted as the λ-expression of type .

 a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ b : γ → β a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ g : γ
 a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ a : β → α a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ b g : β
 a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ a (b g) : α
 a:β → α, b:γ → β ⊢ λ g. a (b g) : γ → α
 a:β → α ⊢ λ b. λ g. a (b g) : (γ → β) → γ → α
 ⊢ λ a. λ b. λ g. a (b g) : (β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α

==Other applications==
Recently, the isomorphism has been proposed as a way to define search space partition in genetic programming. The method indexes sets of genotypes (the program trees evolved by the GP system) by their Curry–Howard isomorphic proof (referred to as a species).

As noted by INRIA research director Bernard Lang, the Curry-Howard correspondence constitutes an argument against the patentability of software: since algorithms are mathematical proofs, patentability of the former would imply patentability of the latter. A theorem could be private property; a mathematician would have to pay for using it, and to trust the company that sells it but keeps its proof secret and rejects responsibility for any errors.

==Generalizations==
The correspondences listed here go much farther and deeper. For example, cartesian closed categories are generalized by closed monoidal categories. The internal language of these categories is the linear type system (corresponding to linear logic), which generalizes simply-typed lambda calculus as the internal language of cartesian closed categories. Moreover, these can be shown to correspond to cobordisms, which play a vital role in string theory.

An extended set of equivalences is also explored in homotopy type theory. Here, type theory is extended by the univalence axiom (&quot;equivalence is equivalent to equality&quot;) which permits homotopy type theory to be used as a foundation for all of mathematics (including set theory and classical logic, providing new ways to discuss the axiom of choice and many other things). That is, the Curry–Howard correspondence that proofs are elements of inhabited types is generalized to the notion of homotopic equivalence of proofs (as paths in space, the identity type or equality type of type theory being interpreted as a path).

<text>Yoo-hoo is an American brand of chocolate-flavored beverage that was created by Natale Olivieri in Garfield, New Jersey, in 1928 and is currently manufactured by Keurig Dr Pepper. As of 2019, the drink is primarily made from water, high-fructose corn syrup and whey.

==History==

Yoo-hoo was created in Garfield, New Jersey, in 1928 by Natale Olivieri, who had been bottling carbonated fruit drinks.

In the 1940s, Thomas Giresi opened a bottling plant in Batesburg, South Carolina, for distribution of Yoo-hoo. In the 1960s, an advertising campaign tried to appeal to an older public for the drink, and featured Yogi Berra and his New York Yankees teammates. Berra, in a pin-striped business suit, drinks a bottle of Yoo-hoo, lifts it next to his cheek, and says with a smile, &quot;It&#x27;s Me-He for Yoo-Hoo!&quot;

Later, Yoo-hoo advertised as : Yoo-hoo, the chocolate action drink.

BBC Industries purchased the rights to Yoo-hoo sometime in the 1950s and retained ownership until 1976, when it sold the brand to Iroquois Brands. Yoo-hoo was sold again in 1981 to a group of private investors, which owned the brand until 1989, when it was sold to the French conglomerate Pernod Ricard.

In 2001, Pernod Ricard sold Yoo-hoo to Cadbury Schweppes, with production responsibilities falling to CS&#x27;s Mott&#x27;s group and marketing and advertising responsibilities under Snapple. They heightened awareness of the once-popular beverage.

The drink company&#x27;s headquarters are in Tarrytown, New York, with plants in Carlstadt, New Jersey, and Aspers, Pennsylvania. An Opelousas, Louisiana, location closed in 2009. At one time, Yoo-hoo owned several other chocolate milk brands as well, including Choc-Ola, Brownie, Cocoa Dusty, and Chocolate Soldier.

In May 2008, Cadbury-Schweppes split into the Cadbury candy business and the Dr Pepper Snapple Group soft drink firm, with the latter taking over Yoo-hoo.

===Alleged misleading advertising===
In 2010, a legal suit was brought against the Dr Pepper Snapple Group in New York state by Timothy Dahl. The suit alleged that the Dr Pepper Snapple Group engaged in misleading advertising as to the nutritional makeup of Yoo-hoo. Papers filed by Dahl claimed that the drink &quot;contains dangerous, unhealthy, non-nutritious partially hydrogenated oil&quot;. Further, he stated that the drink &quot;contains virtually no milk and instead is mostly water, sugars, milk by-products and chemicals.&quot; However, Motts LLP, which made the drink during this time, said the drink contains &quot;seven vitamins and minerals and no preservatives&quot; and that they stood by their product.

==Flavors==
Yoo-hoo began introducing new flavors to its lineup in 1995, including chocolate-coconut, chocolate-mint, chocolate-banana, and chocolate-strawberry. Yoo-hoo&#x27;s other flavors have included vanilla, strawberry, cookies &amp; cream, chocolate peanut butter, and chocolate caramel. The Double Fudge, banana, and Island Coconut flavors were discontinued.

Long term use (&gt; 10 days) is not recommended due to a rhinitis medicamentosa when stopped. Use is not recommended during pregnancy. Xylometazoline is in the decongestant and alpha-adrenergic agonist families of medication.

One study classified it with selectivity ratios in alpha 2 adrenergic receptors of 151 for a2A vs a2B, 4.5 a2A vs a2C, and 33.9 a2B vs a2C.  Making it a highly selective a2A agonist.
Xylometazoline was patented in 1956 and came into medical use in 1959. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Xylometazoline is available as a generic medication.

==Mechanism of action==
Xylometazoline works by stimulating adrenergic receptors on the lamina propria of blood vessels in the nose. The decongestant effect is due to constriction of large veins in the nose which swell up during the inflammation of any infection or allergy of the nose. The smaller arteries are also constricted and this causes the colour of the nasal epithelium to be visibly paler after dosage.

Xylometazoline is an imidazole derivative which is designed to mimic the molecular shape of adrenaline. It binds to α1 and α2 adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa. Due to its sympathomimetic effects, it should not be used by people with high blood pressure, or other heart problems.

Extended usage of xylometazoline can result in decreased effectiveness or a buildup of tolerance against the drug. The number of receptors decreases, and when the administration of the drug is ceased, chronic congestion can occur; this is called rhinitis medicamentosa, commonly referred to as rebound congestion. Moreover, long-term overdosing can cause degenerative changes in nasal mucous membranes that pose another health problem.

==Society and culture==
In 2021, a US FDA Drug Safety Communication stated that, while a US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) proposed rule regarding child-resistant packaging covered products containing xylometazoline, no such products were marketed in the United States at that time.

===Brand names===
The most common name for over-the-counter products containing xylometazoline internationally is &quot;Otrivin&quot; (used in Australia, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, India, Israel, Jordan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Egypt, Sweden, Vietnam, Hong Kong), &quot;Otrivine&quot; (United Kingdom, Ireland, Turkey, Belgium), or &quot;Otriven&quot; (Germany). A product marketed as &quot;Otrivin Oxy&quot; contains oxymetazoline instead of xylometazoline.

Other product names used include Antazol (Square, in Bangladesh), Xylomet (Opsonin, Bangladesh), Cirovin, Klarigen (in Denmark), Nasolin (in Finland), Neo-Rinoleina, Novorin, Olynth, Otrinoz, Galazolin (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus), Nasomist-X, Otrix, Rhinoset, Zenfresh, Naphthyzinium, Xymelyn (in Latvia), Sinutab Nasal Spray, Snup akut, Sudafed, Xylo-COMOD, Xylolin (in the United Arab Emirates), Xylovit, Olynth (in Serbia, the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Slovakia), Meralys (in Croatia) Xynosine (in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan), Xymelin, Zymelin, Xylostar, Xylorin (in Poland), Nasobol, Xylo Mepha and others (Switzerland), Decozal (in Jordan), Nasic, Orinox (Romania), Narhimed (Italy), nasa Rhinathiol (Belgium), Zolinol, Nasorhinathiol, and Vibrocil (Portugal).

===Formulations===
The standard adult solution strength is 0.1% w/v xylometazoline (or 1 mg per 1 mL solution).

== Synthesis ==
5-tert-Butyl-m-xylene is reacted with chloromethyl methyl ether in the presence of zinc chloride to form 2,6-dimethyl-4-tert-butyl-benzylchloride, which is then reacted with sodium cyanide in the presence of potassium iodide to produce 2,6-dimethyl-4-tert-butyl-benzylcyanide. This is then reacted with ethylene diamine in the presence of para-toluenesulfonic acid to form the corresponding imidazoline, this being xylometazoline. Carbon disulfide can also be used as a catalyst in the last step. When using para-toluenesulfonic acid, the resulting salt can be basified and extracted with hydrochloric acid to produce xylometazoline hydrochloride, which is the main form used in medications.

<doc id="254310" wikidata="Q1180791" url="?curid=254310" title="Dead Boys">
<text>The Dead Boys are an American punk rock band from Cleveland, Ohio. The band was among the first wave of punk, and regarded by many as one of the rowdiest and most violent groups of the era. They were formed by vocalist Stiv Bators, rhythm guitarist Jimmy Zero, bassist Jeff Magnum, lead guitarist Cheetah Chrome, and drummer Johnny Blitz in 1975, with the latter two having splintered from the band Rocket From The Tombs. The original Dead Boys released two studio albums, &quot;Young, Loud and Snotty&quot;, and &quot;We Have Come for Your Children&quot;.

The Dead Boys were initially active from 1975 to 1980, briefly reuniting a few times in the mid-1980s, and then later again in 2004 and 2005 for the first time without Bators, who had died in 1990. In September 2017, Chrome and Blitz reunited the band with a new line-up for a 40th anniversary tour along with a new album, &quot;Still Snotty: Young, Loud and Snotty at 40&quot;, a re-recording of their debut album. This lineup included vocalist Jake Hout, guitarist Jason &quot;Ginchy&quot; Kottwitz and bassist Ricky Rat, alongside Chrome and Blitz. Hout quit in November 2024 over plans for a new Dead Boys album with an AI-synthesized Bators vocal.

==History==
===Formation and 1970s punk rock era===
Chrome and Blitz joined Cleveland proto-punk band Rocket From The Tombs in late 1974. Chrome invited his friend Steve Bators on stage to sing a few songs at a show in August 1975. This caused most of the other band members to walk off stage and they broke up. Shortly thereafter Bators, Chrome and Blitz recruited Magnum and Zero to form Frankenstein who recorded demos in October but they broke up in January 1976. When the band members relocated to New York City in July 1976, they adopted the Dead Boys moniker which came from a line in the RFTT song &quot;Down in Flames&quot;.

Moving to New York City at the encouragement of Joey Ramone, the Ramones&#x27; lead singer, the Dead Boys quickly gained notoriety for their outrageous live performances. Lewd gestures and profanity were the norm. They frequently played at the rock club CBGB (the band was briefly managed by club owner Hilly Kristal) and in 1977 they released their debut album, &quot;Young, Loud and Snotty&quot;, produced by Genya Ravan. Their song &quot;Sonic Reducer&quot; is often regarded as one of the classics of the punk genre, with AllMusic calling it &quot;one of punk&#x27;s great anthems.&quot;

Their second album, &quot;We Have Come for Your Children&quot;, produced by Felix Pappalardi, was recorded in Miami in early 1978 and released later that year. Sire Records pressured the group to change their look and sound to appeal more to the U.S. mainstream (which had yet to embrace punk on the level seen in the UK) and this contributed to Dead Boys breaking up in 1979. 

Shortly after returning from Miami, Johnny Blitz and a group of his friends got into an altercation on Second Avenue in Manhattan which led to Blitz being stabbed in the chest five times. While he was recovering in the hospital, a benefit was held for him at which the Dead Boys performed with John Belushi and former New York Dolls and Johnny Thunders &amp; the Heartbreakers drummer Jerry Nolan filling in for Blitz on drums.

Several 1979 performances were featured in the 1980 film, &quot;D.O.A.&quot;. A few months after the breakup, the band had to reunite to record a live album and thus fulfill their contractual obligations. To exact revenge on the label, Bators purposely sang off mic and the resulting recording was unusable. When the material eventually surfaced on Bomp! Records, Bators had re-recorded the vocals in a studio. They booked a 1979 - 80 tour but Magnum, then Chrome, Blitz and finally Zero left, leaving Bators as the only original member. He recorded his first solo album with the final (until later reunions) Dead Boys lineup.

===Bators&#x27; and Chrome&#x27;s subsequent careers===
in 1979, Bators recorded some singles including a cover of &quot;It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; by the Choir and a solo album, &quot;Disconnected&quot;, for BOMP! Records. Bators later joined the Wanderers with former members of Sham 69 and shortly thereafter formed Lords of the New Church with Brian James from The Damned and Dave Tregunna from Sham 69. They released several albums on IRS Records, including the keyboard-laden hit single &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; and a cover of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;.

After the Dead Boys dissolved, Cheetah Chrome played around New York City (mostly at Max&#x27;s Kansas City) doing shows with The Stilettos as well as his own band Cheetah Chrome and the Casualties. He recorded a single for ORK Records, &quot;Still Wanna Die&quot; / &quot;Take Me Home&quot;, recorded with Atlantic Records co-founder Herb Abramson. Shortly thereafter, he played on Ronnie Spector&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Siren&quot;. He appeared on several recordings during the 1980s, and rejoined the Dead Boys for their ill-fated reunions of the late 1980s.

In 2003, after the release of &quot;The Day the Earth Met the Rocket from the Tombs&quot;, Chrome reformed Rocket from the Tombs with David Thomas, Craig Bell, with Steve Mehlman (Pere Ubu) on drums and Richard Lloyd (Television) replacing the late Peter Laughner. This reincarnation of the group toured in 2003 and 2006.

In summer 2003, they entered the studio to record some of the band&#x27;s old material for the first time. The recordings were released as &quot;Rocket Redux&quot;. In 2005, the members of Rocket from the Tombs flew to Germany to headline one night (Buzzcocks headlined the other) of the International Punk Kongress in Kassel; then, in 2006, they reconvened in Cleveland, Ohio to write material for a new record. This material became the single &quot;I Sell Soul&quot;/&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, released in 2010, and the full-length album &quot;Barfly&quot;, released in 2011.

In early 2010, Chrome formed a short lived band called Batusis with Syl Sylvain of the New York Dolls. They recorded at least 10 songs but released only four on an EP. In September 2010, &quot;Cheetah Chrome: A Dead Boy&#x27;s Tale from the Front Lines of Punk Rock&quot; was published. At the end of a week-long Rocket from the Tomb tour in December 2011, Chrome announced to the band that he had decided to stop touring extensively after 2012. He currently works for Plowboy Records in Nashville, TN, mainly in production and promotion.

===Reformation, death of Bators, 40th anniversary tour===
The Dead Boys reformed for several gigs in the 1980s. They re-released their first album as &quot;Younger, Louder and Snottier&quot; in 1989, mastered from a cassette tape of rough mixes, attributed to a young Bob Clearmountain, a studio assistant at the time.

In June 1990, Bators died in France due to injuries sustained after having been hit by a taxi. In September 2004, the remaining members of the band re-formed for a one-off gig in Cleveland. In 2005, they played a benefit show for CBGB and another reunion show on Halloween.

On April 25, 2017, Chrome and Blitz played six shows in Canada as a tribute to the 40th anniversary of &quot;Young, Loud and Snotty&quot;. The band played the record in its entirety. Chrome and Blitz then announced in 2017 that the band would go on a full reunion tour.

On September 8, 2017, &quot;Still Snotty: Young, Loud and Snotty at 40&quot; was released. The album is a re-recording of their debut album and the first studio album by the Dead Boys in 39 years. Along with Chrome and Blitz, the tour and album featured Jason &quot;Ginchy&quot; Kottwitz (Bulemics, Sylvain Sylvain and the Sylvains, Cheetah Chrome solo band) on guitar, Ricky Rat (Trash Brats) on bass, and vocalist Jake Hout from zombie-themed Dead Boys tribute band the Undead Boys.

Chrome said of the tour &quot;(w)ith the 40th anniversary of the Dead Boys on the horizon and a solid band that could interpret and deliver the performance and sound needed to maintain the authenticity of the Dead Boys, I reached out to Johnny Blitz about an anniversary tour and he said yes and we began the journey of what would become Still Snotty. I&#x27;ve been singing the Dead Boys songs myself for 20 years because I couldn&#x27;t find another singer I trusted enough to hand it to. The first gig with Jake, it was like, &#x27;You got it, man!&#x27; I think Stiv would be very proud of our choice.&quot; A photobook, &quot;Dead Boys 1977: The Lost Photographs of Dave Treat&quot;, was also released on September 29, 2017.

==In popular culture==
In 2013, the American biographical drama film &quot;CBGB&quot; about the former New York music venue of the same name was released. Bators is portrayed by actor Justin Bartha, best known for his roles in &quot;The Hangover&quot; films and the &quot;National Treasure&quot; films, while Rupert Grint, best known for his work in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series as Ron Weasley, portrays Cheetah Chrome. Chrome also makes a cameo appearance in the film.

<text>Trans-Mississippi was a common name of the geographic area west of the Mississippi River during the 19th century. The term &quot;Trans-Mississippi&quot; was historically used to refer to any land &quot;across the Mississippi&quot; (or the entire western two-thirds of the United States), including Nebraska, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, Minnesota, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Washington and Oregon. It also included Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), Alaska, Hawaii, and other U.S. territories. 

In 1898, a Trans-Mississippi Exposition was held in Omaha, Nebraska.

==Legacy==
The postage stamps of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition Issue are considered some of the most beautiful stamps ever issued by the United States, and a complete set of the &quot;Trans-Miss&quot; has been highly prized since its 1898 issue. Demonstrating the ongoing significance of the event and its focus, on its 100th anniversary in 1998, a set of stamps using designs derived from the original issue was issued to commemorate its 100th anniversary.

<doc id="254316" wikidata="Q423098" url="?curid=254316" title="Neomycin">
<text>Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that displays bactericidal activity against Gram-negative aerobic bacilli and some anaerobic bacilli where resistance has not yet arisen. It is generally not effective against Gram-positive bacilli and anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli. Neomycin comes in oral and topical formulations, including creams, ointments, and eyedrops. Neomycin belongs to the aminoglycoside class of antibiotics that contain two or more amino sugars connected by glycosidic bonds.
Neomycin was discovered in 1949 by microbiologist Selman Waksman and his student Hubert Lechevalier at Rutgers University. Neomycin received approval for medical use in 1952. Rutgers University was granted the patent for neomycin in 1957.

==Discovery==
Neomycin was discovered in 1949 by the microbiologist Selman Waksman and his student Hubert Lechevalier at Rutgers University. It is produced naturally by the bacterium &quot;Streptomyces fradiae&quot;. Synthesis requires specific nutrient conditions in either stationary or submerged aerobic conditions. The compound is then isolated and purified from the bacterium.

==Medical uses==
Neomycin is typically applied as a topical preparation, such as Neosporin (neomycin/polymyxin B/bacitracin). The antibiotic can also be administered orally, in which case it is usually combined with other antibiotics. Neomycin is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has been used as a preventive measure for hepatic encephalopathy and hypercholesterolemia. By killing bacteria in the intestinal tract, Neomycin keeps ammonia levels low and prevents hepatic encephalopathy. Due to its poor GI tract absorption, orally administered neomycin has also been used to reduce the risk of post operative infection following gastrointestinal surgery.

Waksman and Lechevalier originally noted that neomycin was active against streptomycin-resistant bacteria as well as &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, the causative agent for tuberculosis. Neomycin has also been used to treat small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Neomycin is not administered via injection, as it is extremely nephrotoxic (damaging to kidney function) even when compared to other aminoglycosides. The exception is when neomycin is included, in small quantities, as a preservative in some vaccines – typically 25 μg per dose.

In 2022, the combination of neomycin with dexamethasone and polymyxin B was the 274th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions.

===Spectrum===
Similar to other aminoglycosides, neomycin has excellent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and is partially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. It is relatively toxic to humans, with allergic reactions noted as a common adverse reaction (see: hypersensitivity). Physicians sometimes recommend using antibiotic ointments without neomycin, such as Polysporin. The following represents minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) susceptibility data for a few medically significant Gram-negative bacteria.
* &quot;Enterobacter cloacae&quot;: &gt;16 μg/ml
* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;: 1 μg/ml
* &quot;Proteus vulgaris&quot;: 0.25 μg/ml

==Side effects==
In 2005–06, Neomycin was the fifth-most-prevalent allergen in patch test results (10.0%). It was named Allergen of the Year in 2010. Neomycin is also a known GABA &quot;gamma&quot;-Aminobutyric acid antagonist and can be responsible for seizures and psychosis. Like other aminoglycosides, neomycin has been shown to be ototoxic, causing tinnitus, hearing loss, and vestibular problems in a small number of patients. Neomycin affects the cochlea, which is found in the inner ear. Hearing loss is caused by ear hair cell death, which occurs in response to treatment with neomycin. Patients with existing tinnitus or sensorineural hearing loss are advised to speak with a healthcare practitioner about the risks and side effects prior to taking this medication.

==Molecular biology==

===Activity===
Neomycin&#x27;s antibacterial activity stems from its binding to the 30S subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome, where it inhibits prokaryotic translation of mRNA.

Neomycin also exhibits a high binding affinity for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a phospholipid component of cell membranes.

===Resistance===
Neomycin resistance is conferred by either one of two kanamycin kinase genes. Genes conferring neomycin-resistance are commonly included in DNA plasmids used to establish stable mammalian cell lines expressing cloned proteins in culture. Many commercially available protein expression plasmids contain a &quot;neo&quot;-resistance gene as a selectable marker.
Currently, research is being performed to understand if derivatives of neomycin have the same antibiotic effects while still being effective against neomycin-resistant bacteria.

==Biosynthetic pathway==
Neomycin was first isolated from the &quot;Streptomyces fradiae&quot; and &quot;Streptomyces albogriseus&quot; in 1949 (NBRC 12773). Neomycin is a mixture of neomycin B (framycetin); and its epimer neomycin C, the latter component accounting for some 5–15% of the mixture. It is a basic compound that is most active with an alkaline reaction. It is also thermostable and soluble in water (while insoluble in organic solvents). Neomycin has good activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but is ototoxic. Its use is thus restricted to the oral treatment of intestinal infections.

Neomycin B is composed of four linked moieties: -neosamine, 2-deoxystreptamine (2-DOS), -ribose, and -neosamine.

Neomycin A, also called neamine, contains -neosamine and 2-deoxystreptamine. Six genes are responsible for neamine biosynthesis: DOIS gene (btrC, neo7); L-glutamine:DOI aminotransferase gene (btrS, neo6); a putative glycosyltransferase gene (btrM, neo8); a putative aminotransferase (similar to glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase) gene (btrB, neo18); a putative alcohol dehydrogenase gene (btrE, neo5); and another putative dehydrogenase (similar to chorine dehydrogenase and related flavoproteins) gene (btrQ, neo11). A deacetylase acting to remove the acetyl group on N-acetylglucosamine moieties of aminoglycoside intermediates (Neo16) remains to be clarified (sequence similar to BtrD).

Next is the attachment of the -ribose via ribosylation of neamine, using 5-phosphoribosyl-1-diphosphate (PRPP) as the ribosyl donor (BtrL, BtrP); glycosyltransferase (potential homologues RibF, LivF, Parf) gene (Neo15).

Neosamine B (-neosamine B) is most likely biosynthesized in the same manner as the neosamine C (-niosamine) in neamine biosynthesis, but with an additional epimerization step required to account for the presence of the epimeric neosamine B in neomycin B.
Neomycin B and C are 23-carbon molecules with a four-ring structure. Three of the rings are six-membered, and one is five-membered.
Neomycin B and Neomycin C are stereoisomers of each other and differ by only one stereocenter one giving the R conformation and the other giving the S conformation. 
Neomycin C can undergo enzymatic synthesis from ribostamycin.

==Composition==
Standard grade neomycin is composed of several related compounds including neomycin A (neamine), neomycin B (framycetin), neomycin C, and a few minor compounds found in much lower quantities. Neomycin B is the most active component in neomycin followed by neomycin C and neomycin A. Neomycin A is an inactive degradation product of the C and B isomers. The quantities of these components in neomycin vary from lot-to-lot depending on the manufacturer and manufacturing process.

==DNA binding==
Aminoglycosides such as neomycin are known for their ability to bind to duplex RNA with high affinity. The association constant for neomycin with A-site RNA is in the 109 M−1 range. However, more than 50 years after its discovery, its DNA-binding properties were still unknown. Neomycin has been shown to induce thermal stabilization of triplex DNA, while having little or almost no effect on the B-DNA duplex stabilization. Neomycin was also shown to bind to structures that adopt an A-form structure, triplex DNA being one of them. Neomycin also includes DNA:RNA hybrid triplex formation.

<text>Summerhill School is an independent (i.e. fee-charging) day and boarding school in Leiston, Suffolk, England. It was founded in 1921 by Alexander Sutherland Neill with the belief that the school should be made to fit the child, rather than the other way around. It is run as a democratic community and is considered a democratic school; the running of the school is conducted in the school meetings, which anyone, staff or pupil, may attend, and at which everyone has an equal vote. These meetings serve as both a legislative and judicial body. Members of the community are free to do as they please, so long as their actions do not cause any harm to others, according to Neill&#x27;s principle &quot;Freedom, not Licence.&quot; This extends to the freedom for pupils to choose which lessons, if any, they attend. It is an example of both democratic education and alternative education.

==History==

In 1920, A.S. Neill started to search for premises in which to found a new school which he could run according to his educational principle of giving freedom to the children and staff through democratic governance. On a trip to Europe, which started out as a research visit into progressive schools on behalf of the Theosophical journal &quot;New Era&quot;, he found the ideal accommodation in Hellerau near Dresden, a village founded on principles based on the Garden City movement in England. By combining with two other projects, the &quot;Neue Deutsche Schule&quot; (New German School), founded by Carl Thiess the previous year, and an existing school with many international students dedicated to the teaching of Eurhythmics, a joint venture named the International School or &quot;Neue Schule Hellerau&quot; was launched. Neill&#x27;s sector was called the &quot;foreign&quot; school (in contrast to the Thiess&#x27;s &quot;German School&quot;). Jonathan Croall wrote, &quot;This, in essence, was the beginning of Summerhill&quot; although the name Summerhill itself came later.

Neill was soon dissatisfied with Neue Schule&#x27;s ethos, and moved his sector of the organisation to Sonntagberg in Austria. Due to the hostility of the local people, it moved again in 1923 to Lyme Regis in England. The house in Lyme Regis was called Summerhill, and this became the name of the school. In 1927, it moved to its present site in Leiston, Suffolk, England. It had to move again temporarily to Ffestiniog, Wales, during the Second World War so that the site could be used as a British Army training camp.

The school had a local impact as several teachers were involved in the formation of the Leiston Communist Party. Several teachers were involved in the Communist Party, some before they were appointed: Vivien Jackson, was the daughter of T. A. Jackson, a leading figure in the Communist Party of Great Britain and his wife Kate Hawkins, one of the founders of the Socialist Party of Great Britain. She married A. L. Morton, a prominent Communist Party historian who also worked at the school. The artist Paxton Chadwick was appointed as a part-time art teacher in the early thirties. At this time, the Communist mathematician and computer pioneer Richard Goodman was also a teacher at the school. Cyril Eyre was also a member of staff. Although Neill himself was sympathetic towards the goal of communism, he was increasingly critical of Stalinism and the contemporary Communist Party. He wrote to David Barton, a former pupil at the time in the communist party, saying:
After Neill died in 1973, it was run by his wife, Ena May Neill, until 1985.

Today it is a boarding and day school serving primary and secondary education in a democratic fashion. It is now run by Neill&#x27;s daughter, Zoë Readhead, assisted by her sons Will and Henry Readhead.

Although the school&#x27;s founding could arguably be dated to other years, the school itself marks 1921 as the year of its establishment.

== Schools based on Summerhill ==

Many schools opened based on Summerhill, especially in America in the 1960s. A common challenge was to implement Neill&#x27;s dictum of &quot;freedom, not licence&quot;: &quot;A free school is not a place where you can run roughshod over other people. It&#x27;s a place that minimises the authoritarian elements and maximises the development of community and really caring about the other people. Doing this is a tricky business.&quot;

Neill distanced himself from some schools for confusing freedom and licence: &quot;Look at those American Summerhill schools. I sent a letter to the Greenwich Village Voice, in New York, disclaiming any affiliation with any American school that calls itself a Summerhill school. I&#x27;ve heard so many rumours about them. It&#x27;s one thing to use freedom. Quite another to use licence.&quot;

===Government inspections===
Summerhill has had a tumultuous relationship with the British government. Already in the 1950s, a government inspection found the school&#x27;s finances were shaky, the number of students too high, and the quality of teaching poor among the junior faculty. In spite of these criticisms, however, the inspectors apparently found the school praiseworthy.

During the 1990s, the school was inspected nine times. It later emerged that this was because Ofsted had placed Summerhill on a secret list of 61 independent schools marked as &quot;TBW&quot; (to be watched).

In March 1999, following a major inspection from Ofsted, the then Secretary of State for Education and Employment, David Blunkett, issued the school a notice of complaint, based on the school&#x27;s policy of non-compulsory lessons. Failure to comply with such a notice within six months usually leads to closure; however, Summerhill chose to contest the notice in court.

The case went before a special educational tribunal in March 2000, at which the school was represented by noted human rights lawyers Geoffrey Robertson QC and Mark Stephens. Four days into the hearing, the government&#x27;s case collapsed and a settlement was agreed. The pupils attending the hearing on that day took over the courtroom and held a school meeting to debate whether to accept the settlement. They voted unanimously to do so.

The nature of the settlement was notably broader than could have been decided on the judge&#x27;s authority alone. The educational tribunal only had the power to annul the notice of complaint, whereas the settlement made provisions that Summerhill be inspected with respect to its philosophy and values, that the voice of the child (through community meetings and in other ways) be included in the inspection, and that the inspectors be accompanied by two advisers from the school and one from the DfE to ensure that the inspection respected the school&#x27;s aims and values. The school was the first in England to grant children a legal right to formally express their opinions and to meet with the inspectors. The DfE advisers have included Prof. Paul Hirst and Prof. Geoff Whitty, Director of the Institute of Education and now on Ofsted&#x27;s governing body.

The first full inspection report since the disputed 1999 report was published in 2007. The 2007 inspection, conducted within the framework set out by the court settlement, was generally positive, even in areas previously criticised by the 1999 report. The school maintained that it had not changed its approach since the original inspection.

The full inspection on 5 October 2011 concluded that the school is outstanding in all areas except teaching, which was seen as good, and not outstanding due to issues of assessment.

In February 2013, the DfE unilaterally rescinded the court agreement by claiming that Ofsted now understood the school and the court mandated inspection process was no longer needed to ensure a fair inspection. The school sent evidence and questions to the Select Committee on Education for their meeting with the Chief Inspector of Schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, on 13 February 2013. The evidence quoted a member of the Select Committee expressing shock at the lack of processes for Ofsted to learn by its mistakes.

===A. S. Neill Summerhill Trust===
The A. S. Neill Summerhill Trust was launched in 2004 by Prof. Tim Brighouse, Tom Conti, Bill Nighy, Mark Stephens and Geoffrey Robertson QC to raise funds for bursaries for pupils from poorer families and to promote democratic education around the world. It publishes an electronic newsletter and organises fund-raising events. An elected committee of schoolchildren, called the &quot;External Affairs Committee&quot;, have—over the years since the court case and with the support of the Trust—promoted Summerhill as a case study to state schoolchildren, teachers and educationalists at conferences, schools and events. They have run full democratic meetings at the Houses of Parliament and London&#x27;s City Hall. They have lobbied four chief inspectors of schools through the Select Committee on Education on the importance of children&#x27;s rights in schools and school inspections. They have addressed the UNESCO Conference of Education Ministers, lobbied and protested at the UN Special Conference on the Rights of the Child in New York. They took an active part in advising and contributing to events for the children&#x27;s rights group Article 12. They continue to work with schools, colleges and universities.

==Philosophy and educational structure==
Summerhill is noted for its philosophy that children learn best with freedom from coercion, a philosophy that was promoted by the New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914–37) that helped to define the good modern primary school as child-centred. At Summerhill, all lessons are optional, and pupils are free to choose what to do with their time. Neill founded Summerhill with the belief that &quot;the function of a child is to live his own life—not the life that his anxious parents think he should live, not a life according to the purpose of an educator who thinks he knows best.&quot;

In addition to taking control of their own time, pupils can participate in the self-governing community of the school. School meetings are held twice a week, where pupils and staff alike have an equal voice in the decisions that affect their day-to-day lives, discussing issues and creating or changing school laws. The rules agreed at these meetings are wide-ranging—from agreeing to acceptable bed times to allowing nudity around the pool and within the classrooms. Meetings are also an opportunity for the community to vote on a course of action for unresolved conflicts, such as a fine for a theft (usually the fine consists of having to pay back the amount stolen). If there is an urgent reason to have a meeting, children and staff can ask the chairperson to hold a special meeting and this is written on the main whiteboard before a meal time so that the whole school knows and can attend.

In creating its laws and dealing out sanctions, the school meeting generally applies A. S. Neill&#x27;s maxim &quot;Freedom not Licence&quot; (he wrote a book of the same name), the principle that you can do as you please so long as it doesn&#x27;t cause harm to others. For example, pupils may swear within the school grounds, but calling someone else an offensive name is licence.

Summerhill School operates upon the major principles of democracy, equality and freedom.

Classes are voluntary at Summerhill. Although most students attend, depending on their age and reasons, children choose whether to go of their own accord and without adult compulsion. The staff discuss new children and those who they feel may have issues that interfere with their freedom to choose (e.g., fear of classrooms, shyness to learn in front of others, lack of confidence), and propose and vote on interventions, if needed, during staff meetings. This is called the &quot;Special Attention List&quot;. The staff meet at least twice a week to discuss issues; those relevant to the community will be brought to a community meeting. Children can attend these meetings when they ask, but are asked to leave when individual students are discussed, to maintain the privacy of the student.

===Academics===
Although Neill was more concerned with the social development of children than their academic development, Summerhill nevertheless has some important differences in its approach to teaching. There is no concept of a &quot;year&quot; or &quot;form&quot; at Summerhill. Instead, children are placed according to their interest or level of understanding in a given subject. It is not uncommon for a single class to have pupils of widely varying ages, or for pupils as young as 13 or 14 to take GCSE examinations. This structure reflects a belief that children should progress at their own pace, rather than having to meet a set standard by a certain age.

There are also two classrooms which operate on a &quot;drop-in&quot; basis for all or part of the day, the workshop and the art room. Anyone can come to these classrooms and, with supervision, make just about anything. Children commonly play with wooden toys (usually swords or guns) they have made themselves, and much of the furniture and décor in the school has been likewise constructed by students.

Neill believed that children who were educated in this way were better prepared than traditionally educated children for most of life&#x27;s challenges—including higher education. He wrote that Summerhill students who decided to prepare for university entrance exams were able to finish the material faster than pupils of traditional schools. Inspector accounts assert that this was inaccurate, and that interested pupils were disadvantaged by their dearth of preparation. However, Michael Newman has argued that the inspectors assumed that lesson attendance was necessary evidence of children learning, and that lack of attendance was equated with a lack of learning. Newman says the inspectors refused to accept as evidence the students&#x27; exam results, verbal evidence from teachers, current and previous children, and the success of children after leaving Summerhill.

The Summerhill classroom was popularly assumed to reflect Neill&#x27;s anti-authoritarian beliefs, but in fact classes were traditional in practice. Neill did not show outward interest in classroom pedagogy, and was mainly interested in pupil happiness. He did not consider lesson quality important, and thus there were no distinctive Summerhillian classroom methods. Neill also felt that charismatic teachers taught with persuasion that weakened child autonomy. 
Today the school peer-reviews its teachers, and has policies and systems in place to ensure the quality of teaching. Since Zoë Readhead took over as Principal, the school has developed an ethos of keeping its staff, through an increase in wages and conditions of work, and there is an ongoing review and development of methods of teaching, assessment and record-keeping.

The staff now share with each other their methods, especially in relation to numeracy and literacy learning. The music department have developed over several years, including action research, methods of supporting spontaneous music performance, creativity and development of expression through music. This is being shared with the rest of the staff. The school has always had a creative drama delivery, based on spontaneous acting and development of plays through collaboration between actors, directors and writers. With small-group teaching and negotiated timetables, the curriculum is presented in multi-sensory, individual-focused lessons, with flexibility to respond to the student&#x27;s needs.

===Boarding houses and pastoral care===
Children at Summerhill are placed in one of five groups which correspond to the buildings in which they are accommodated. Placement is generally decided at the beginning of term by the Principal, in theory according to age. In practice, a younger child may take priority if they have been waiting a long time for a place, if they have many friends in the upper group, or if they show a maturity characteristic of a member of the upper group.

Certain school rules pertain specifically to certain age groups. For instance, no one else may ride a &quot;San&quot; child&#x27;s bicycle, and only &quot;Shack&quot; and &quot;Carriage&quot; children are allowed to build camp fires. The rules concerning when children must go to bed are also made according to age group.

Bedrooms generally accommodate four or five children.

====Houseparents====
Each of the boarding houses has a &quot;houseparent&quot;: a member of staff whose duty is pastoral care. The duties of a houseparent include doing their charges&#x27; laundry, treating minor injuries and ailments, taking them to the doctor&#x27;s surgery or hospital for more serious complaints and general emotional support. Depending on the age group, they might also tell them bedtime stories, keep their valuables secure, escort them into town to spend their pocket money, or speak on their behalf in the meetings.

====San====
Ages 6–8 (approx)

The San building is an outbuilding, near the primary classrooms; its name derives from the fact that it was originally built as a sanatorium. When there proved to be insufficient demand for a separate sanatorium, it was given over to accommodation for the youngest children and their houseparent. At one time, San children were housed in the main school building, and the San building was used as the library. They have since moved back, and the rooms they previously occupied now house the Cottage children.

The laws of the school generally protect San children, both by disallowing them from engaging in certain dangerous activities and preventing older children from bullying, swindling or otherwise abusing their juniors. San children have the right to bring up their cases at the beginning of the school meeting, or have another student or a teacher bring the issue or issues up on their behalf.

San children can sleep in mixed-sex rooms, while older children have single-sex rooms.

====Cottage====
Ages 9–10 (approx)

Cottage children were originally housed in Neill&#x27;s old cottage, at the edge of the school grounds. For some time, the San wholly replaced the Cottage, but Cottage children are now housed in the main school building.

====House====
Ages 12–13 (approx)

House children are accommodated in the main school building, called simply &quot;the House&quot;.

====Shack====
Ages 13–14 (approx)

The Shack buildings (there are two, the Boys&#x27; Shack and the Girls&#x27; Shack) are small outbuildings, so called because of the somewhat ramshackle nature of their original construction. The buildings have since been renovated.

Children of Shack age and above are expected to take a more active role in running the school, standing for committees, chairing the meetings, acting as ombudsmen to resolve disputes and speaking in the school meetings. Of course, younger children can take on some of these roles if they so wish, and few of them are compulsory, even for the older children. The only compulsory role is to be added to a rotation to supervise work fines.

====Carriages====
Ages 15+ (approx)

The carriage buildings are similar to those of the Shack, only larger. However, they were originally converted rail carriages. Since the last renovation, the Boys&#x27; Carriage building incorporates a bathroom, shower, kitchenette and the Girls&#x27; Carriages a common room and shower block (other bathrooms in the main building have only baths). Either facility may be used by both sexes and all areas.

The Carriage children each have individual rooms. They are expected to do their own laundry and generally look after themselves. This is not to say that they have no houseparent, just that as part of their increased freedom they must take on additional responsibility.

===Conflict resolution===
There are two main methods of resolving conflicts at Summerhill.

====Ombudsmen====
In the first instance, one should go to an ombudsman to resolve a conflict. The ombudsmen are an elected committee of older members of the community, whose job it is to intervene in disputes. One party will go and find an ombudsman and ask for an &quot;Ombudsman Case&quot;. Often, all the ombudsman has to do is warn someone to stop causing a nuisance. Sometimes, if the dispute is more complex, the ombudsman must mediate. If the conflict cannot be resolved there and then, or the ombudsman&#x27;s warnings are ignored, the case can be brought before the school meeting.

In special cases, the meeting sometimes assigns an individual their own &quot;special ombudsman&quot;, an ombudsman who only takes cases from one person. This usually happens if a particular child is being consistently bullied, or has problems with the language (in which case someone who is bilingual, in English and the language of the child in question, is chosen as the ombudsman.)

====The tribunal====
The tribunal is the school meeting which concerns itself with people who break the school rules. Sometimes there is a separate meeting for the tribunal, and sometimes the legislative and judicial meetings are combined. This is itself a matter which can be decided by the meeting.

A &quot;tribunal case&quot; consists of one person &quot;bringing up&quot; another, or a group of people. The person bringing the case states the problem, the chairperson asks those accused if they did it, and if they have anything to say, then calls for any witnesses. If the accused admits to the offence, or there are reliable witness statements, the chair will call for proposals. Otherwise, the floor is opened to discussion.

If there is no clear evidence as to who is guilty (for instance, in the case of an unobserved theft), the &quot;investigation committee&quot; is often called upon. The investigation committee has the power to search people&#x27;s rooms or lockers, and to question people. They will bring the case back to the next meeting if they are able to obtain any new evidence. In a community as small as Summerhill, few events go totally unnoticed and matters are usually resolved quickly.

Once it has been established that a person has broken the rules, the meeting must propose and then vote to decide a fine. There is no such thing as a &quot;standard fine&quot;, no equivalent to a judge&#x27;s sentencing guidelines, and most fines are given with consideration to the factors involved, such as severity of the offence, intent behind the action, consequences to others, remorse and/or behaviour displayed during the meeting, and whether it was a repeat offence. Fines can include a &quot;strong warning&quot; administered by the chair, a monetary fine, loss of privileges (for instance, not being allowed out of school, or being the last to be served lunch), or a &quot;work fine&quot; (e.g., picking up litter for a set time or similar job of benefit to the community). In the case of theft, it is usually considered sufficient for the thief to return what was stolen. Although there are some rare cases where the property stolen is no longer in the possession of the thief; in these cases, the thief is given a more severe fine and is questioned as to where the property has been sent.

== Notoriety and criticism==

Summerhill received most of its public attention in two waves: the 1920s/30s and 1960s/70s. In particular, the 1960 American edition of Neill&#x27;s writings, &quot;Summerhill&quot;, made the school into an example for a wide public, and led to an American movement with copycat schools. A. S. Neill&#x27;s biographer Richard Bailey linked this increased interest to the wider society&#x27;s interest in social change (progressivism and the counterculture, respectively), though he added that Neill was not influenced by this reception.

Richard Bailey argued that the students&#x27; free choice of what to learn may leave them unexposed to subject matter which they do not know to exist, and also may narrow their exposure to subjects fashionable in a given time period. The school has said it now has mechanisms in place to alleviate such concerns.

Bailey reviews an account of an algebra lesson taught by Neill, and describes Neill&#x27;s teaching technique as &quot;simply awful&quot;, for his lack of pupil engagement, inarticulate explanations, and insults directed at pupils. Bailey criticised Neill&#x27;s avoidance of responsibility for his pupils&#x27; academic performance, and his view that charismatic instruction was a form of persuasion that weakened child autonomy.

Bailey also did find, however, that the media were unreasonably critical in their coverage of the school. For instance, they tended to emphasize casual teacher–pupil relations and lack of compulsory classes, instead of the weekly meeting. They also represented Summerhill&#x27;s pupils as unrestricted and anarchic, to an unrealistic degree.

===Controversies===
Mikey Cuddihy, a graduate of Summerhill, wrote that in the 1960s: &quot;It was common for students to get married in mock weddings, and they were allowed to sleep together ... More worryingly, sexual relations between students and teachers were also common ... Neill&#x27;s 35-year-old stepson Myles, who taught pottery ... went out with some of the more senior pupils (because) he has a special dispensation.&quot;

In his book &quot;Summerhill&quot; (1960), Neill shows an influence of Wilhelm Reich&#x27;s theories, e.g., promoting adolescent sexual activity, and claiming that a negative attitude towards masturbation causes juvenile delinquency.

Although Neill was not a trained psychotherapist, he held amateur psychoanalytic sessions with some of his children. These sessions were designed to &quot;unblock&quot; the &quot;energies&quot; of the children. For this purpose Neill also gave body massages to the children, a technique advocated by Reich. In &quot;Summerhill&quot;, Neill gave accounts of such psychoanalytic sessions.

Neill wrote that &quot;Promiscuity is neurotic; it is a constant change of partner in the hope of finding the right partner at last. [...] If the term &quot;free love&quot; has a sinister meaning, it is because it describes sex that is neurotic.&quot;

==Notable former pupils==
* John Burningham, children&#x27;s author and illustrator
* Keith Critchlow, artist and professor of architecture
* Rebecca De Mornay, actress
* Storm Thorgerson, rock album cover designer
* Gus Dudgeon, record producer

==In fiction and television==

Enid Blyton&#x27;s &quot;The Naughtiest Girl&quot; series of novels, written in the 1940s and 50s, were her first series about school-aged children, and they were set in a school based on Summerhill, with democratic community meetings allowing the children to make decisions about the school and &quot;punishments&quot; etc.

Ira Levin&#x27;s novel &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1967) has the main character reading a copy of Neill&#x27;s book &quot;Summerhill&quot; and discussing it with her friends.

The school was the subject of the 1987 ITV documentary &quot;Being Happy is What Matters Most&quot;. This was later parodied in the 1997 Channel 4 documentary show &quot;Brass Eye&quot; in its second episode, &quot;Drugs&quot;. The fictional documentary entitled &quot;The Drumlake Experiment&quot; featured an interview with the school&#x27;s headmaster, Donaldus Matthews, played by David Cann.

In 1991, Zoe Readhead made an extended appearance on the Channel 4 discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot; alongside, among others, the 13-year-old James Harries.

In 1992, Channel 4&#x27;s documentary show &quot;Cutting Edge&quot; created an episode on &quot;Summerhill at 70&quot;, broadcast on 30 March.

In 2008 BBC1, CBBC and BBC Four aired a miniseries called &quot;Summerhill&quot;. The show was set in Summerhill and presented a highly fictionalised version of the 2000 court case and the events leading up to it. Much of the production was recorded on location at Summerhill and used pupils as extras. The production presented an unabashedly positive view of the school as the Director, Jon East, wanted to challenge the present paradigm of what a school is, as presented in popular culture. It received two BAFTAs, including one for script, by Alison Hume.

A 2022 documentary about the school, &quot;How Summerhill Works&quot;, by local independent filmmaker Peter Chadwick, documented daily life at the school.

<text>The Royal Concertgebouw (, ) is a concert hall in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The Dutch term &quot;concertgebouw&quot; translates into English as &quot;concert building&quot;. Its superb acoustics place it among the finest concert halls in the world, along with Boston&#x27;s Symphony Hall and the Musikverein in Vienna.

In celebration of the building&#x27;s 125th anniversary, Queen Beatrix bestowed the royal title &quot;Koninklijk&quot; upon the building on 11 April 2013, as she had on the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra upon its 100th in 1988.

==History==
The architect of the building was , who was inspired by the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, built two years earlier (and destroyed in 1943).

Construction began in 1883 in a pasture that was then outside the city, in Nieuwer-Amstel, a municipality that in 1964 became Amstelveen. A total of 2,186 wooden piles, 12 to 13 metres (40 to 43 ft) long, were emplaced in the soil. The Concertgebouw was completed in late 1886, however due to the difficulties with the municipality of Nieuwer-Amstel – filling in a small canal, paving the access roads and installing street lights – the grand opening of the building was delayed.

The hall opened on 11 April 1888 with an inaugural concert, in which an orchestra of 120 musicians and a chorus of 500 singers participated, performing works of Wagner, Handel, Bach, and Beethoven. The resident orchestra of the Concertgebouw is the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (&quot;Koninklijk Concertgebouworkest&quot;), which gave its first concert in the hall on 3 November 1888, as the Concertgebouw Orchestra (&quot;Concertgebouworkest&quot;). For many decades from the 1950s to the present day the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra (previously the Amsterdam Philharmonic Orchestra) as well as the Radio Filharmonisch Orkest also provide their regular concert series in the Concertgebouw.

On 17 September 1969, British progressive rock band Pink Floyd performed their &quot;The Man and The Journey&quot; show at Concertgebouw. The show&#x27;s climax was a rendition of &quot;Celestial Voices&quot; (renamed &quot;The End of the Beginning&quot;) in which keyboardist Rick Wright played the hall&#x27;s organ in place of his Farfisa. The performance was released on CD as part of the band&#x27;s 2016 box set, &quot;The Early Years 1965–1972&quot; in &quot;Volume 3: 1969 Dramatis/ation&quot;.

Today, some 900 concerts and other events per year take place in the Concertgebouw, for a public of over 700,000, making it one of the most-visited concert halls in the world.

, the managing director of the Concertgebouw is Simon Reinink and the artistic director is Anneke Hogenstijn.

== Building ==
The Main Hall (&quot;Grote Zaal&quot;) seats 1,974, and is long, wide, and high. Its reverberation time is 2.8 seconds without audience, 2.2 seconds with, making it ideal for the late Romantic repertoire such as Mahler. Although this characteristic makes it largely unsuited for amplified music, groups such as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and The Who did perform there in the 1960s. In the Main Hall, there is a layer of dust in several places as removing this layer would impact the acoustics as they are now.

A smaller, oval-shaped venue, the Recital Hall (&quot;Kleine Zaal&quot;), is located behind the Main Hall. The Recital Hall is long and wide. Its more intimate space is well-suited for chamber music and Lieder. The Recital Hall has 437 seats.

In 1983, the Concertgebouw was found to be sinking into the damp Amsterdam earth, with several inch-wide cracks appearing in the walls, so the hall embarked on extensive fundraising for renovations. Its difficult emergency restoration started in 1985, during which the 2,186 rotting wooden pilings were replaced with concrete pillars. Dutch architect Pi de Bruijn designed a modern annex for a new entrance and a basement to replace cramped dressing and rehearsal space.
== Organ ==

The organ was built in 1890 by the organ builder Michael Maarschalkerweerd from Utrecht, and was renovated in the years 1990 to 1993 by the organ builder Flentrop. It has 60 registers on three divisions and pedal.
* Couplers: II/I (also as Suboktavkoppel), III/I, III/II, I/P, II/P, III/P

==Names of composers in the Main Hall==
In the Main Hall, the surnames of the following 46 composers are displayed on the balcony ledges and on the walls:

<text>A public space is a place that is open and accessible to the general public. Roads, pavements, public squares, parks, and beaches are typically considered public space. To a limited extent, government buildings which are open to the public, such as public libraries, are public spaces, although they tend to have restricted areas and greater limits upon use. Although not considered public space, privately owned buildings or property visible from sidewalks and public thoroughfares may affect the public visual landscape, for example, by outdoor advertising. Recently, the concept of shared space has been advanced to enhance the experience of pedestrians in public space jointly used by automobiles and other vehicles.

Public space has also become something of a touchstone for critical theory in relation to philosophy, urban geography, visual art, cultural studies, social studies and urban design. The term &#x27;public space&#x27; is also often misconstrued to mean other things such as &#x27;gathering place&#x27;, which is an element of the larger concept of social space. Public spaces have often been valued as democratic spaces of congregation and political participation, where groups can vocalize their rights.

Commons are early examples of public space. Malls, regardless of private ownership percentage, are examples of &#x27;public space&#x27; since no fees or paid tickets are required for entry. However, most indoor shopping malls and strip malls are private property and subject to the rights of the owners.

Filming in public spaces is legal, but shopping malls are privately owned properties and often require permission for photography and video.

==Use==

===Right to common passage===
In Nordic countries, like Norway, Sweden, Finland, and also Estonia, all nature areas are considered public space, due to a law, the &quot;allemansrätten&quot; (the right to common passage).

===Definition in the United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom a &quot;Public place&quot; includes any highway and any other premises or place to which at the material time the public have or are permitted to have access, whether on payment or otherwise.

===Restrictions on state action in the United States===

In the United States the right of the people to engage in speech and assembly in public places may not be unreasonably restricted by the federal or state government. The government cannot usually limit one&#x27;s speech beyond what is reasonable in a public space, which is considered to be a public forum (that is, screaming epithets at passers-by can be stopped; proselytizing one&#x27;s religion probably cannot). In a private—that is, non-public—forum, the government can control one&#x27;s speech to a much greater degree; for instance, protesting one&#x27;s objection to medicare reform will not be tolerated in the gallery of the United States Senate. This is not to say that the government can control what one says in their own home or to others; it can only control government property in this way. The concept of a public forum is not limited to physical space or public property, for example, a newspaper might be considered a public forum, but see forum in the legal sense as the term has a specific meaning in United States law.

Parks, malls, beaches, waiting rooms, etc., may be closed at night. As this does not exclude any specific group, it is generally not considered a restriction on public use. Entry to public parks cannot be restricted based upon a user&#x27;s residence.

===Social norms===
In some cultures, there is no expectation of privacy in a public space, however civil inattention is a process whereby individuals are able to maintain their privacy within a crowd.

===Controversy regarding restrictions on use===

Public space is commonly shared and created for open usage throughout the community, whereas private space is owned by individuals or corporations. The area is built for a range of various types of recreation and entertainment. Limitations are imposed in the space to prevent certain actions from occurring—public behavior that is considered obnoxious or out of character (i.e., drug and alcohol consumption, urinating, indecent exposure, etc.)--and are supported by law or ordinance. Through the landscape and spatial organization of public space, the social construction is considered to be privately ruled by the implicit and explicit rules and expectations of the space that are enforced.

Whilst it is generally considered that everyone has a right to access and use public space, as opposed to private space which may have restrictions, there has been some academic interest in how public spaces are managed to exclude certain groups - specifically homeless people and young people.

Measures are taken to make the public space less attractive to them, including the removal or design of benches to restrict their use for sleeping and resting, restricting access to certain times, locking indoor/enclosed areas. Police forces are sometimes involved in moving &#x27;unwanted&#x27; members of the public from public spaces. In fact, by not being provided suitable access, disabled people are implicitly excluded from some spaces.

===As a site for democracy===

Human geographers have argued that in spite of the exclusions that are part of public space, it can nonetheless be conceived of as a site where democracy becomes possible. Geographer Don Mitchell has written extensively on the topic of public space and its relation to democracy, employing Henri Lefebvre&#x27;s notion of the right to the city in articulating his argument. While democracy and public space do not entirely coincide, it is the potential of their intersection that becomes politically important. Other geographers like Gill Valentine have focused on performativity and visibility in public spaces, which brings a theatrical component or &#x27;space of appearance&#x27; that is central to the functioning of a democratic space.

===Privatization===

A privately owned public space, also known as a privately owned public open space (POPOS), is a public space that is open to the public, but owned by a private entity, typically a commercial property developer. Conversion of publicly owned public spaces to privately owned public spaces is referred to as the privatization of public space, and is a common result of urban redevelopment.

Beginning roughly in the 1960s, the privatization of public space (especially in urban centers) has faced criticism from citizen groups such as the Open Spaces Society. Private-public partnerships have taken significant control of public parks and playgrounds through conservancy groups set up to manage what is considered unmanageable by public agencies. Corporate sponsorship of public leisure areas is ubiquitous, giving open space to the public in exchange for higher air rights. This facilitates the construction of taller buildings with private parks.

In one of the newer U.S. incarnations of the private-public partnership, the business improvement district (BID), private organizations are allowed to tax local businesses and retail establishments so that they might provide special private services such as policing and increased surveillance, trash removal, or street renovation, all of which once fell under the control of public funds.

===Semi-public spaces===
A broader meaning of public space or place includes also places where everybody can come if they pay, like a café, train, or movie theater. A shop is an example of what is intermediate between the two meanings: everybody can enter and look around without obligation to buy, but activities unrelated to the purpose of the shop are at the discretion of the proprietor.

The halls and streets (including skyways) in a shopping center may be declared a public place and may be open when the shops are closed. Similarly for halls, railway platforms and waiting rooms of public transport; sometimes a travelling ticket is required. A public library is a public place. A rest stop or truck stop is a public space.

For these &quot;semi-public&quot; spaces stricter rules may apply than outside, e.g. regarding dress code, trading, begging, advertising, photography, propaganda, riding rollerskates, skateboards, a Segway, etc.

==In design theory==
Public space, as a term and as a concept in design, is volatile. There is much conversation around what constitutes public space, what role it plays, and how design should approach and deal with it.

===Historical shift===
Historically, public space in the west has been limited to town centres, plazas, church squares, i.e. nearly always engineered around a central monument, which informs the program of the space. These spaces acted as the &#x27;commons&#x27; of the people; a political, social and cultural arena. Of the thirteen colonies that became the United States, three were comprehensively planned with integrated physical, social, and economic elements. These planned colonies of Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Georgia each placed emphasis on public space, in particular the public square. The plan for Georgia, known as the Oglethorpe Plan created a unique design in which a public square was created for every ward of forty residential lots and four civic or commercial lots. The design has been preserved in the Savannah historic district.

Jürgen Habermas&#x27; concept of the public sphere links its emergence with the development of democracy. A good example of this is the New Deal projects. The New Deal was a brief period in the US under Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s government that produced a huge number of public works in an economic effort to boost employment during the depression. The result, however, was more than this. They constituted a legacy of what has been called the cultural infrastructure underlying American public space. The New Deal projects have been credited with significantly contributing to the quality of American life and encouraging unity between all aspects of the community. It has been recently argued, however, that the democratic ideal of public life through the use of public space has deteriorated. As our cities accelerate towards segregation (social, economic, cultural, ethnic), the opportunity for public interaction is on the decline. John Chase writes, &quot;The importance of voluntary and obligatory participation in civic life has been usurped by the consciousness of the arbitrary nature of assigned cultural meanings and by the increasingly important role that consumption of goods and services plays in the formation of individual identity.&quot;

===Modern critique===
Modern architectural critics have lamented on the &#x27;narrative of loss&#x27; within the public sphere. That is, modern society has withdrawn from public life that used to inform city centres. Political and social needs, and forums for expression, can now be accessed from the home. This sentiment is reflected in Michael Sorkin&#x27;s and Mike Davis&#x27; declaration of &quot;the end of public space&quot; and the &quot;destruction of any truly democratic urban spaces.&quot; Another side of the debate, however, argues that it is people who apply meaning to public space, wherever it may be. It has been suggested that the concepts of public, space, democracy, and citizenship are being redefined by people through lived experience. Discussion has surfaced around the idea that, historically, public space has been inherently contradictory in the way that it has always been exclusive in who has been able to participate. This has caused the &quot;counterpublics&quot;, as identified by Nancy Fraser, to establish their own public spaces to respond to their own concerns. These spaces are in constant flux, and in response, its users restructure and reinterpret physical space. An example of this is in the African-American neighbourhood, Baldwin Hills, Los Angeles. Here, a parking lot has evolved into a scene of intense commercial and social activity. Locals gather here to meet and socialise, sell and consume goods. The example has been used to illustrate that the historical ideal of fixed public space around a monument is not viable for a contemporary diverse social range as &quot;no single physical space can represent a completely inclusive &#x27;space of democracy&#x27;.&quot;

===Art===

This sense of flux and change, informs how contemporary public art has evolved. Temporal art in public spaces has been a long established practice. But the presence of public art has become increasingly prevalent and important within our contemporary cities. Temporal public art is so important because of its ability to respond to, reflect, and explore the context which it inhabits. Patricia Phillips describes the &quot;social desire for an art that is contemporary and timely, that responds to and reflects its temporal and circumstantial context.&quot; Public art is an arena for investigation, exploration and articulation of the dense and diverse public landscape. Public art asks its audience to re-imagine, re-experience, re-view and re-live. In the design field, a heavy focus has been turned onto the city as needing to discover new and inspired ways to re-use, re-establish and re-invent the city, in step with an invigorated interest in rejuvenating our cities for a sustainable future. Contemporary design has become obsessed with the need to save the modern city from an industrialized, commercialized, urban pit of a death bed. In some cases, dance, music and other cultural events organised by the local community have been crucial in the process of revitalisation of some decayed public spaces. 

===Approaching urban design===
Contemporary perception of public space has now branched and grown into a multitude of non-traditional sites with a variety of programs in mind. It is for this reason that the way in which design deals with public space as a discipline, has become such a diverse and indefinable field.

Iris Aravot puts forward an interesting approach to the urban design process, with the idea of the &#x27;narrative-myth&#x27;. Aravot argues that &quot;conventional analysis and problem solving methods result in fragmentation...of the authentic experience of a city...[and] something of the liveliness of the city as a singular entity is lost.&quot; The process of developing a narrative-myth in urban design involves analysing and understanding the unique aspects of the local culture based on Cassirer&#x27;s five distinctive &quot;symbolic forms&quot;. They are myth and religion, art, language, history and science; aspects often disregarded by professional practice. Aravot suggests that the narrative-myth &quot;imposes meaning specifically on what is still inexplicable&quot;, i.e. the essence of a city.

== Space Design ==
Space design is defined as the &quot;art and science of designing and arranging physical spaces to make them more conducive to human flourishing and  wellbeing. This process involves considering factors such as lighting, colour, furniture layout, and overall atmosphere to create a space that is both efficient and engaging for its users. Space design is commonly employed in a variety of settings, including homes, offices, restaurants, and retail stores, to name a few.

=== Primary goals ===
One of the primary goals of space design is to create an environment that promotes positive emotional responses in its occupants. Studies have shown that people have a natural inclination towards certain types of spaces, such as those with natural lighting, open layouts, and comfortable seating. Another important consideration in space design is the concept of flow, or the ease with which people can move through a space. This involves designing spaces that are intuitive and free from obstructions, allowing users to navigate them without feeling frustrated or disoriented.

One crucial aspect of space design is the creation of a welcoming and inclusive environment that satisfies people&#x27;s social and emotional needs outside of their home and work. This is often referred to as the &quot;third place&quot; concept, which describes public locales of social interaction that provide psychological comfort and emotional support.

<text>Wiley University (formerly Wiley College) is a private historically black college in Marshall, Texas. Founded in 1873 by the Methodist Episcopal Church&#x27;s Bishop Isaac Wiley and certified in 1882 by the Freedman&#x27;s Aid Society, it is one of the oldest predominantly black colleges west of the Mississippi River.

In 2005–2006, on-campus enrollment approached 450, while an off-campus program in Shreveport, Louisiana, for students with some prior college credits who seek to finish a degree, enrolled about 250. By fall of 2006, total enrollment was about 750. By fall of 2013, total enrollment reached over 1,000. Wiley is an open admissions college and about 96% of students receive some financial aid.

The college is known for its debate team. Over a 15-year period, Melvin B. Tolson&#x27;s debate teams lost only one of 75 debates. Wiley&#x27;s debate team competed against historically black colleges and earned national attention with its 1935 debate against University of Southern California&#x27;s highly ranked debate team.

On November 3, 2023, Wiley College announced a name change back to Wiley University for the first time since 1929 with the establishment of a new graduate school program to be offered to students beginning in 2024.

== History ==
Wiley University, established in 1873 in Marshall, Texas, by the Freedmen’s Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. It is the oldest historically black college (or institute of higher education) west of the Mississippi River. It was started as both a college and high school.

In 1880, the campus was moved to a seventy-acre plot in downtown Marshall. The former campus location was in south Marshall, near the remaining Wiley College Cemetery. In 1888, Henry B. Pemberton was the first college graduate, he was awarded a B.A. degree.

F.C. Moore was the first president, and for the first twenty years the president and all the faculty and staff, were church missionaries and were White. The first African American president of Wiley University was Isaiah B. Scott, who served from 1893 until 1896; with his election he changed the institutions policy regarding the race of faculty and staff. In 1896, Scott became editor of the Southwest Christian Advocate, and Matthew Winfred Dogan replaced him as the president, a role he maintained until 1942.

In 1906 a fire destroyed five of the eleven buildings on campus, but they were rebuilt. In 1907, the president’s home and a library on campus were built by students, after president Dogan was able to secure a Carnegie Foundation grant. The library was open to the entire community of Marshall, and it was the only library until 1974. By 1929, the institution no longer supported a high school. During that same year, the university renamed itself as Wiley College.

=== Civil Rights Movement ===
Wiley, along with Bishop College, was instrumental in the Civil Rights movement in Texas. Wiley and Bishop students launched the first sit-ins in Texas in the rotunda of the Old Harrison County Courthouse to protest segregation in public facilities.

James Farmer, son of James L. Farmer, Sr., graduated from Wiley and became one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of the Civil Rights Movement. Together with Roy Wilkins, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Whitney M. Young Jr., James Farmer helped organize the first sit-ins and Freedom Rides in the United States.

==Debate team==
Tony Scherman&#x27;s article about the Wiley College debate team for the 1997 Spring issue of &quot;American Legacy&quot; sparked a renewed interest in its history. The success of the 1935 Wiley College debate team, coached by professor and poet Melvin Tolson, was the subject of a 2005 AMS Pictures documentary, &quot;The Great Debaters, The Real Great Debaters of Wiley College,&quot; which received heavy play around Texas, followed by the 2007 dramatic movie, &quot;The Great Debaters&quot;, directed by and starring Denzel Washington. In 1935, the Wiley College debate team defeated the reigning national debate champion, the University of Southern California (depicted as Harvard University in &quot;The Great Debaters&quot;).

In 2007, Denzel Washington announced a donation of $1 million to Wiley so the team could be re-established. The following year, &quot;The Great Debaters&quot; movie debuted, starring Washington; the college&#x27;s debate team has taken this name, too.

In 2014, the 23-person team won 1st place at the Pi Kappa Delta Comprehensive National Tournament. This was the largest Pi Kappa Delta Tournament in their 101-year history. This was the first national speech and debate title won by an HBCU. Three years later, the college led the establishment of the first HBCU National Speech and Debate League. In 2018, Wiley hosted the first HBCU National Speech and Debate League Tournament.

==Athletics==
The Wiley athletic teams are called the Wildcats. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the HBCU Athletic Conference (HBCUAC), formerly known as the Gulf Coast Athletic Conference (GCAC), since the 2022–23 academic year. The Wildcats previously competed in the Red River Athletic Conference (RRAC) from 1998–99 to 2021–22. They were also a founding member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) from 1920–21 to 1967–68, which is currently an NCAA Division I FCS athletic conference.

Wiley competes in ten intercollegiate varsity teams: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer and track &amp; field. Women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, track &amp; field and volleyball. Wiley the Wildcat is the mascot. Former sports included cheerleading.

On January 20, 2022, Wiley received an invitation to join the GCAC, along with Oakwood University (from the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA)) and the return of Southern University at New Orleans (SUNO), effective beginning in July 2022. The GCAC is an athletic conference affiliated with the NAIA.

<text>The Battle of the Ardennes took place during the First World War fought on the frontiers of France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg from 21 to 23 August 1914. The German armies defeated the French and forced their retreat. The battle was part of the larger Battle of the Frontiers, the first battle of the Western Front.

== Background ==

===Belgium===

Belgian military planning was based on an assumption that other powers would expel an invader but the likelihood of a German invasion did not lead to France and Britain being seen as allies or for the Belgian government intending to do more than protect its independence. The Anglo-French Entente (1904) had led the Belgian government to think that the British attitude to Belgium was that it had come to be seen as a protectorate. A Belgian General Staff was formed in 1910 but the , Lieutenant-Général Harry Jungbluth was retired on 30 June 1912 and only replaced in May 1914 by Lieutenant-General Chevalier Antonin de Selliers de Moranville, who began work on a contingency plan for the concentration of the army and also met railway officials on 29 July.

Belgian troops were to be massed in central Belgium, in front of the National redoubt of Belgium ready to face any border, while the Fortified Position of Liège and Fortified Position of Namur were left to secure the frontiers. On mobilisation, the King became Commander-in-Chief and chose where the army was to concentrate. Amid the disruption of the new rearmament plan the disorganised and poorly trained Belgian soldiers would benefit from a central position to delay contact with an invader but it would also need fortifications for defence, which were on the frontier. A school of thought wanted a return to a frontier deployment in line with French theories of the offensive. Belgian plans became a compromise in which the field army concentrated behind the river Gete with two divisions forward at Liège and Namur.

===Schlieffen–Moltke Plan===


Field marshal Alfred Graf von Schlieffen was Chief of the German General Staff (, OHL) from 1891 until his retirement in 1906. A student of Carl von Clausewitz, like other Prussian officers, he had been taught that &quot;the heart of France lies between Paris and Brussels&quot;. In 1839, the Treaty of London masterminded by the British diplomat Lord Palmerston was signed by France, Prussia, Russia, Austria and the United Kingdom creating the independent Kingdom of Belgium. France and Russia joined in a military alliance in 1892, which threatened Germany with the possibility of a war on two fronts. German strategy gave priority to an offensive operation against France and a strategic defensive against Russia. Planning would be determined by numerical inferiority, speed of mobilisation, concentration and the effect of modern weaponry. The Germans expected frontal attacks to be costly and protracted, leading to limited success, particularly after the French and Russians modernised the fortifications on their frontiers with Germany. To evade the fortified frontier with France, Schlieffen devised a plan that by 1898–99 envisioned German forces rapidly passing between Antwerp and Namur to take Paris from the north, inflicting a quick and decisive defeat on France.

The German left flank in occupied Alsace would tempt the French into attacking there, drawing the French forces away from Paris and the German right. In its 1906 version, the Schlieffen Plan allocated six weeks and seven eighths of the Imperial German Army (a force of 1.5 million men) to overwhelm France while the remainder fought against the Russian Army in East Prussia. Helmuth von Moltke the Younger succeeded Schlieffen in 1906 and was less certain that the French would conform to German assumptions. Moltke adapted the deployment and concentration plan to accommodate an attack in the centre or an enveloping attack from both flanks as variants to the plan, by adding divisions to the left flank opposite the French frontier, from the expected to be mobilised in the (western army). The main German force would still advance through Belgium and attack southwards into France, the French armies would be enveloped on the left and pressed back over the Meuse, Aisne, Somme, Oise, Marne and Seine, unable to withdraw into central France. The French would either be annihilated or the manoeuvre from the north would create conditions for victory in the centre or in Lorraine on the common border. Moltke planned for a force of about 320,000 men to defend Alsace-Lorraine south of Metz, 400,000 men to invade France and Luxembourg through the Ardennes and 700,000 more troops to invade Belgium.

===Plan XVII===


After the defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, France had been humiliated, forced to pay the French indemnity of five billion francs and lost the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine to the new German Empire, so as to permanently put France on the defensive. The French fortified the common border but after 30 years the French felt confident enough to plan for an offensive strategy, thanks in no small part to Ferdinand Foch. France had a population and birth rate smaller than those of Germany and invented the concept of and decided on a strategy of &quot;offensive to the limit&quot;, making the will to fight the cornerstone of French military planning. Colonel Louis Loyzeau de Grandmaison, took up Foch&#x27;s doctrine and delivered two speeches before the that set the foundations of Plan XVII, which was formally adopted in May 1913. French strategists took account of the possibility of envelopment by the German right and calculated that the more powerful the German right, the weaker the center and left would be. The French decided to concentrate their forces on the Rhine, planning to break the German left and center on either side of Metz, to cut off the German right and defeat the German armies in detail.

Under Plan XVII, the French peacetime army was to form five field armies of about two million men, with groups of Reserve divisions attached to each army and a group of reserve divisions on the flanks. The armies were to concentrate opposite the German frontier around Épinal, Nancy and Verdun–Mezières, with an army in reserve around Ste. Ménéhould and Commercy. Since 1871, railway building had given the French General staff sixteen lines to the German frontier against thirteen available to the German army and the French could afford to wait until German intentions were clear. The French deployment was intended to be ready for a German offensive in Lorraine or through Belgium. The French expected that the Germans would use reserve troops but also assumed that a large German army would be mobilised on the border with Russia, leaving the western army with sufficient troops only to advance through Belgium, south of the rivers Meuse and Sambre. French intelligence had obtained a 1905 map exercise by the German general staff, in which German troops had gone no further north than Namur and assumed that plans to besiege Belgian forts were a defensive measure against the Belgian army.

A German attack from south-eastern Belgium towards Mézières and a possible offensive from Lorraine towards Verdun, Nancy and St. Dié was anticipated; the plan was a development of Plan XVI and made more provision for the possibility of a German offensive through Belgium. The First, Second and Third armies were to concentrate between Épinal and Verdun opposite Alsace and Lorraine, the Fifth Army was to assemble from Montmédy to Sedan and Mézières and the Fourth Army was to be held back west of Verdun, ready to move east to attack the southern flank of a German invasion through Belgium or south against the northern flank of an attack through Lorraine. No formal provision was made for joint operations with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) but discreet arrangements had been made between the French and British general staffs; during the Second Moroccan Crisis in 1911, the French had been told that six British divisions could be expected to operate around Maubeuge.

===Declarations of war===
At midnight on the German government sent an ultimatum to Russia and announced a state of (threat of war) during the day; the Turkish government ordered mobilisation and the London Stock Exchange closed. On 1 August, the British government ordered the mobilisation of the navy, the German government ordered general mobilisation and declared war on Russia. Hostilities commenced on the Polish frontier, the French government ordered general mobilisation and next day the German government sent an ultimatum to Belgium, demanding passage through Belgian territory and German troops crossed the frontier of Luxembourg. Military operations began on the French frontier, Libau was bombarded by the German light cruiser and the British government guaranteed naval protection for French coasts. On 3 August, the Belgian Government refused German demands and the British Government guaranteed military support to Belgium, should Germany invade. Germany declared war on France, the British government ordered general mobilisation and Italy declared neutrality. On 4 August, the British government sent an ultimatum to Germany which expired at midnight on Central European Time. Belgium severed diplomatic relations with Germany and Germany declared war on Belgium. German troops crossed the Belgian frontier and attacked Liège.

==Prelude==

===French preparations===
French commander-in-chief Joseph Joffre ordered an attack through the Ardennes forest in support of the French invasion of Lorraine. According to the pre-war French war strategy document, Plan XVII, German forces in the area were only expected to be light, with French light, rapid-firing artillery proving advantageous in a wooded terrain such as that found in the Ardennes. By 20 August, however, it was becoming clear, first to the Fifth Army (General Charles Lanrezac) and then to Commander-in-Chief Joseph Joffre, that a large German force was gathering in the area. That day the Germans launched a counter-attack against the French advance into Lorraine. Even so, Joffre ordered an invasion of the Ardennes on 20 August for the following day.

==Battle==
Joffre issued instructions on 18 August but held back the Third and Fourth armies because air and cavalry reconnaissance found few German troops opposite the two armies, only a large force moving north-west away. On 19 August the Fourth Army (General Fernand de Langle de Cary) was ordered to occupy the bridges over the Semois but not to advance into Belgium until the German offensive began. A premature attack would advance into a trap rather than give time for the Germans to empty Luxembourg of troops before the French advanced. On 20 August the German armies in the south attacked the French First and Second armies and next day the Third and Fourth armies began their offensive. The Fourth Army crossed the Semois and advanced towards Neufchâteau and the Third Army (General Pierre Ruffey) attacked towards Arlon, as a right flank guard for the Fourth army. South of Verdun, the Third army was renamed Army of Lorraine and was to watch for a German offensive from Metz, which left the remainder of the Third Army free to concentrate on the offensive into Belgium. The French armies invaded Belgium with nine infantry corps but ten German corps and six reserve brigades of the 4th and 5th armies lay between Metz and the north of Luxembourg.

The German 4th Army (Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg) and 5th Army (Crown Prince Wilhelm) had moved slower than the 1st, 2nd and 3rd armies and the French advance towards them was reported on 21 August. The French armies had few maps and were unaware of the size of the German force opposite, as the Third Army brushed aside small German detachments. On 22 August in the Third army area, V Corps attacked dug-in German troops at Longwy at in thick fog and heavy rain, with no artillery support. As the fog lifted, German artillery caught the French guns in the open and silenced them. A German counter-attack routed a French division and the corps was not rallied until the evening. To the north the IV Corps also advanced in fog, encountered German troops dug in near Virton and was forced back also with a division routed. On the southern Flank, VI Corps was pushed back a short distance. In the Fourth Army area the II Corps on the right flank managed to keep level with the Third Army to the south but was not able to advance further. The Colonial Corps on the left was defeated at the Battle of Rossignol, south of Neufchâteau and suffered but the 5th Colonial Brigade on the left easily reached Neufchâteau before being repulsed with many casualties. Further north XII Corps advanced steadily but the XVII Corps beyond was outflanked and the 33rd Division lost most of its artillery. On the northern flank the XI and IX corps were not seriously engaged.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
Charbonneau explained that the defeat of the Colonial Corps was caused by faulty reconnaissance, the ineffectiveness of advanced guards in causing delay to advancing German units and that French offensive tactics neglected the importance of obtaining a superiority of fire, which had led to reckless attacks. The quality of the German opponents was not mentioned but German reconnaissance had been effective, communication between commanders and subordinates had not broken down, mutual support between neighbouring units had occurred and German artillery had provided continuous close fire support. At Neufchâteau, the French colonial infantry had been out-gunned and outnumbered by German units, which had been able to engage all their forces quickly. The French XII Corps had a greater number of guns but was not able to overcome two German infantry battalions. German artillery had engaged the Colonial Brigade from close range but when in a hastily occupied defensive position, the French had nullified much of the German artillery-fire; French troops caught in the open had been annihilated. Both sides had attempted to gain fire superiority before advancing and once this had been achieved by the Germans, they had been able to manoeuvre without severe casualties.

The French commanders were ordered by Joffre to continue the offensive on 23 August as early as possible, since his strategy depended on the success of the Third and Fourth armies. Ruffey replied in the morning that the attack could not begin until his divisions had reorganised and in the early afternoon found that the Germans had forestalled another advance, by pushing the V Corps in the centre back for , which led to the rest of the army falling back level. In the Fourth Army area, the 33rd Division of XVII Corps was routed and the rest of the corps had retired during the night of The 5th Colonial Brigade withdrew from Neufchâteau before dawn on 23 August, exposing the right flank of XII Corps, which also fell back. By the end of 23 August, the survivors of the Third and Fourth armies were back to their jumping-off positions except for the XI and IX corps on the northern flank.

===Casualties===

At Rossignol German casualties were and French casualties men.
The French 4th Division had casualties at Bellefontaine against German casualties. At Neufchâteau the 5th Colonial Brigade had casualties against units of the German XVIII Reserve Corps, which suffered casualties. At Bertrix the artillery of the 33rd Division was destroyed and casualties suffered against of the number of German casualties, which were noted to be greater than all of the casualties in the Franco-Prussian War. At Massin-Anloy, the French 22nd Division and 34th Division lost killed and the 34th Division was routed. German casualties in the 25th Division were , of whom were killed. At Virton the French 8th Division was &quot;destroyed&quot; and the 3rd Division had casualties; German losses were .

In the fighting around Éthe and Bleid, the French 7th Division lost and the German 10th Division suffered casualties. At Longwy the French V Corps with the 9th and 10th divisions had casualties and German units of the 26th Division had . South of Longwy, German casualties in the 9th and 12th Reserve and 33rd divisions were men against the French 12th 40th and 42nd divisions, of which the 40th Division was routed. In 2009, Holger Herwig recorded from 21 to 31 August in the 4th Army and in the 5th Army. Herwig also recorded in the French 8th Division at Virton and wrote that at Ethe, the 7th Division had been &quot;stomped&quot;. At Ochamps the 20th Infantry Regiment lost and the 11th Infantry Regiment lost The 5th Colonial Brigade lost

<doc id="254356" wikidata="Q701803" url="?curid=254356" title="Jäger Movement">
<text>The Jäger Movement () consisted of volunteers from Finland who trained in Germany as Jägers during World War I. Supported by Germany to enable the creation of a Finnish sovereign state, the movement was one of many means by which Germany intended to weaken Russia and to cause Russia&#x27;s loss of its western provinces and dependencies.

==History==

The recruitment of volunteers from the Grand Duchy of Finland was clandestine and dominated by German-influenced circles, such as university students and the Finnish upper middle class. The recruitment was however in no way exclusive. In all, over 1,100 volunteers are estimated to have &quot;slipped off&quot; to train in Germany.

The recruits were most often clandestinely transported across Finland&#x27;s western border via Sweden to Germany, where they were formed into the Royal Prussian 27th Jäger Battalion. The Jäger Battalion fought in the ranks of the German Army from 1916 in the battles on the northern flank of the eastern front.
After the outbreak of the Civil War in Finland the Jägers were engaged on the &quot;White&quot; (non-communist) side in the war and formed the nucleus of the new Finnish Army. In Finland, these 2,000 volunteers were simply called the Jägers (Finnish pl. Jääkärit).

Their contribution to the White victory was crucial, not least through improving morale. Having been professionaly trained in Germany, many were also the best candidates to assume command over the untrained troops of the Civil War.

Immediately after the Civil War, they were allowed to use the word &quot;Jäger&quot; in their military ranks. Many of the Jägers continued their military careers. In the 1920s a long feud between officers with Jäger-background and Finnish officers who had served in the Russian Imperial army was concluded in favor of the Jägers. Most of the commanders of army corps, divisions, and regiments in the Winter War were Jägers. The &quot;Jäger March&quot; composed by Jean Sibelius for the words written by Jäger Heikki Nurmio, was the honorary march of many army detachments.

==Conflict with Mannerheim==
The Jäger conflict derived from rising tensions (short of armed conflict) between German-influenced Jägers and politicians who looked to Germany as their ally on one side, and the faction centered on former Russian General and Finnish Commander-in-Chief Baron Gustaf Mannerheim on the other side. The Mannerheim side was oriented towards an alliance with Sweden, which remained neutral during the war but which was opposed to Russia, and with which Finland shared its history up to 1809. Mannerheim, who was from a Finland Swedish family, was respected among Finns, Russians, and Swedes alike. Baron Mannerheim and some of the Swedish-speaking officers of the Finnish army left Finland as a direct consequence of this conflict, as the Finnish senate elected a German prince as King of Finland and would have made Finland a monarchy. However, the kingdom was never realized beyond this election; and when World War I ended and the German Kaiser fled, the nascent Finnish monarchy was replaced by a republic, whereupon Baron Mannerheim returned.

==Today==
At the present time, infantry in the Finnish Army are designated either as infantry or Jäger troops, specifically mechanized infantry or motorised infantry using APCs or vehicles such as Sisu Nasu. Mechanized infantry using IFVs are called &quot;panssarijääkäri&quot; or Armoured Jäger. Several other variations exist, including Finnish Navy Coastal Jäger (Marine), Guard&#x27;s Jäger of the Guard Jaeger Regiment, in special forces (Para) Jäger, Special Jäger, and in the Border Guard border jäger and special border jäger.

<doc id="254363" wikidata="Q156190" url="?curid=254363" title="Peter II of Portugal">
<text>&quot;Dom&quot; Pedro II (Peter II; 26 April 1648 – 9 December 1706), nicknamed the Pacific (&quot;Português:&quot; O Pacífico) was King of Portugal from 1683 until his death, previously serving as regent for his brother Afonso VI from 1668 until his own accession. He was the fifth and last child of John IV and Luisa de Guzmán.

==Early life==

Third son of King John IV and Queen Luisa, Peter was created Duke of Beja and Lord of the House of the Infantado.

Following his father&#x27;s death, his mother became regent for the new king Afonso VI, Peter&#x27;s elder, partially paralyzed, and mentally unstable brother. In 1662, Afonso put his mother away in a convent and assumed control of the state. In January 1668, shortly before Spanish recognition of Portugal&#x27;s restoration of independence, Peter acquired political ascendancy over his brother and was appointed regent, banishing Afonso to the Azores and, later, Sintra where he died in 1683. Peter thereupon inherited the throne.

Peter not only inherited his brother&#x27;s throne but also wed his former spouse, Queen Marie-Françoise of Savoy (1646–1683). They had one daughter, Isabel Luísa, Princess of Beira (1669–90), who was heir presumptive.

==Rule (1668–1706)==
Peter consolidated Portugal&#x27;s independence with the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668, putting the Portuguese Restoration War, that began in 1640, to an end. He formed an alliance with England and had its decisive support based on marriage clauses that united Charles II of England with his sister Catherine of Braganza in 1661. Portugal ceded Tangier and Bombay as a dowry, and compromised to transfer to the English the majority of the places recovered from the Dutch, to share in half the commerce of cinnamon, to install English families with the same privileges of the Portuguese families in Goa, Cochin, Diu, Bahia, Pernambuco and Rio de Janeiro. In exchange, England would give Lisbon military support, protecting Portuguese shipments in the Mediterranean and the coasts of Lisbon and Porto.

After his coup in 1667, Peter restored the nobility to their full power and government by councils of nobles reached a high point during his reign because he required their support in deposing Alfonso VI. However, by the end of his reign, Peter centralized the monarchy&#x27;s power and dissolved the excessive strength of the nobility. His successors would rule as absolute monarchs, and the Cortes would not be assembled for more than a century.

His long tenure was one of important accomplishments. In 1671 he conceded freedom of commerce to the English residing in Portugal and began the establishment of textile manufactures. Isabel Luísa was proclaimed heir presumptive to the throne at the Portuguese Cortes of 1674, Peter promulgating a letter on the regencies and tutorships of Kings to better found the rights of his daughter.

In 1674 his main concern was to improve the defenses of the realm, asking for contributions from the &quot;Junta dos Três Estados&quot; to the keeping of border garrisons, its paraphernalia and indispensable works in castles and forts. The Cortes didn&#x27;t attend to totality of his request, but the great apprehension was in the coastal defense. Veríssimo Serrão, in his book &quot;History of Portugal&quot;, Volume V, page 213 says the following, &quot;The shipments from India and Brazil were the main object of greed so that the Crown was obliged to arm a fleet of 11 boats. (...) The squadron left the Tejo on 21 July 1675, under the command of Pedro Jacques de Magalhães. (...) But the results of such a costly undertaking were none.&quot;

There was a legal impediment to the marriage of his daughter with her cousin, the Duke of Savoy. The so-called Law of the Cortes of Lamego prevented the marriage of an heiress with a foreign prince. This alleged document became fundamental law of the Realm in 1640. The Cortes, called on 1 November 1679, proceeded with the derogation. By then the ambassador of Savoy, the Marquis of Ornano, had come to Lisbon to celebrate the marriage by proxy. But it would all turn ineffective to the extent that the embassy of the Duke of Cadaval, sent to Turin in May 1682, did not reach or did not finish the project, by pressures, perhaps, of Louis XIV on the dynasty of Savoy.

In 1683, Queen Maria Francisca died. In the court there was a strong French party, headed by the Duke of Cadaval, the then Count of Vila Maior and by the Viscount of Ponte de Lima, but others favored a closer alliance with Spain. By marrying again, Peter II chose the sister of the Queen of Spain, daughter of Philipp Wilhelm, Elector Palatine. The new queen, Maria Sophia of Neuburg, never influenced political life, maintaining a low profile. The couple had eight children, including the younger John, who succeeded his father in 1706 as King John V of Portugal.

Peter initially supported France and Spain in the War of Spanish Succession (1701–1714), but on 16 May 1703, Portugal and England signed the Methuen Treaty. This trade accord granted mutual commercial privileges for Portuguese wine and English textile traders and would later give England significant influence in the Portuguese economy. This was followed in December 1703 by a military alliance between Portugal, Austria and England for an invasion of Spain. Portuguese and Allied forces, under the command of the Marquis of Minas, captured Madrid in 1706, during the campaign which ended in the Allied defeat at Almansa.

===Brazil===
Peter obtained papal approval for the elevation of the Bahia bishopric to the status of archbishopric, and the creation of the bishoprics of Olinda and Rio de Janeiro in 1676. In 1677 saw the creation of the bishopric of Maranhão, directly subordinated to the archbishopric of Lisbon. In 1686, via decree from the Missionary Regiment, the privileges of the Jesuits in the interior of the Northern region were restricted. There was, however, resistance to the reordering process of the colonial administration, such as the Beckman revolt of 1684 that sublevated the Maranhão colonists against the monopoly of the General Company of Commerce of Grão-Pará and Maranhão and the rise of the Tapuias in the 1680s in various regions of the Northeast.

The discovery of gold in the interior of Caetés, Minas Gerais, at the end of the 17th century, began an age of economic prosperity and administrative change. The year 1693 saw the creation of the Captaincy of São Paulo and Minas Gerais. The Intendancy of Minas Gerais was formed in 1702. This period saw the destruction of the Quilombo dos Palmares, Alagoas, in 1695.

The King fixed the basis of his Brazilian policy in two main points: the importation of precious metals and stones and the expansion of the borders of the colony to the banks of the Río de la Plata. He sent the Viscount of Barbacena to Brazil with instructions to encourage mining exploration. The reputation of the Paulistas was such that, urged by Barbacena, Peter wrote to twelve frontiersmen Piratinganos, and provided them with the &quot;incomparable honor&quot; of a direct summoning them to place their employment at the royal service.

Under his reign the Casa da Moeda do Brasil was created on 8 March 1694. The King ceded his seigniorage rights, tribute owed to him, in favor of the better functioning of this institution, that minted the first Brazilian coins for usage within the colony. These coins of 2,000 and 4,000 réis in gold, and 640, 320, 160, 80, 40 and 20 réis in silver amplified and diversified the circulating midst in Brazil.

By the end of Peter&#x27;s reign, there were two big problems in Brazil: the dispute over the Colónia do Sacramento that, even though since 1680 recognized as Portuguese territory, was occupied by the Spanish in 1705, and the first conflicts between Paulistas and Emboabas, competing outsiders, including metropolitan people (ie. people from European Portugal), who arrived in the region in search of gold.

==Death==

Beginning in 1703 the King went through times of deep drowsiness that doctors attributed to a &quot;downflow of &#x27;estilicido&#x27;&quot;, i.e., severe infection of the larynx. On 5 December 1706 he was stricken with a &quot;legitimate pleurisy&quot;, that derived a seizure, with which he lost consciousness. The bloodletting from his feet did not yield results, and on 9 December, the attack became fatal. It is believed nowadays that the King suffered from a liver disease, because the autopsy found &quot;a part of his liver twisted where 25 stones in the gall could be found&quot;. He died in the Palhavã Palace, in Lisbon.

He was the last surviving child of John IV of Portugal, and is buried in Lisbon in the Pantheon of the Braganzas.

==Assessment==
Historian Veríssimo Serrão says of The King in his &quot;History of Portugal&quot;, Volume IV, page 233:

&quot;A coeval historian extolled his physical qualities, skilled both in arms as in horseback bullfighting, having an agility and strength that predisposed him to the exercise of violence. It was during his time that the Palace of Salvaterra de Magos became again the favorite place of court, Pedro II settling there in the months of January and February, to devote himself to the sport of riding.&quot; (...) &quot;Master of a great memory, the monarch never refused an audience to whoever asked it, was it day or night, delighted to listen to others and to discuss the issues in the smallest details. This quality was&quot; (...) &quot;one of his biggest flaws, because he always wanted to hear the opinion of advisers, fact that led to him dilating the problems. His reign had as a great aim to rebuild the country, shaken by the wars of Restoration. Since 1693 he could dispose of the gold from Brazil that gave to this work the decisive push that Portugal needed. But the participation in the Wars of the Spanish Succession went against the national interests.&quot;

He was tall, well proportioned, with dark eyes and dark hair.

He earned the nickname &quot;the Pacific&quot;, because peace was made with Spain during his regency in 1668.

<text>In mathematics, certain kinds of mistaken proof are often exhibited, and sometimes collected, as illustrations of a concept called mathematical fallacy. There is a distinction between a simple &quot;mistake&quot; and a &quot;mathematical fallacy&quot; in a proof, in that a mistake in a proof leads to an invalid proof while in the best-known examples of mathematical fallacies there is some element of concealment or deception in the presentation of the proof.

For example, the reason why validity fails may be attributed to a division by zero that is hidden by algebraic notation. There is a certain quality of the mathematical fallacy: as typically presented, it leads not only to an absurd result, but does so in a crafty or clever way. Therefore, these fallacies, for pedagogic reasons, usually take the form of spurious proofs of obvious contradictions. Although the proofs are flawed, the errors, usually by design, are comparatively subtle, or designed to show that certain steps are conditional, and are not applicable in the cases that are the exceptions to the rules.

The traditional way of presenting a mathematical fallacy is to give an invalid step of deduction mixed in with valid steps, so that the meaning of fallacy is here slightly different from the logical fallacy. The latter usually applies to a form of argument that does not comply with the valid inference rules of logic, whereas the problematic mathematical step is typically a correct rule applied with a tacit wrong assumption. Beyond pedagogy, the resolution of a fallacy can lead to deeper insights into a subject (e.g., the introduction of Pasch&#x27;s axiom of Euclidean geometry, the five colour theorem of graph theory). &quot;Pseudaria&quot;, an ancient lost book of false proofs, is attributed to Euclid.

Mathematical fallacies exist in many branches of mathematics. In elementary algebra, typical examples may involve a step where division by zero is performed, where a root is incorrectly extracted or, more generally, where different values of a multiple valued function are equated. Well-known fallacies also exist in elementary Euclidean geometry and calculus.

==Howlers==

Examples exist of mathematically correct results derived by incorrect lines of reasoning. Such an argument, however true the conclusion appears to be, is mathematically invalid and is commonly known as a &quot;howler&quot;. The following is an example of a howler involving anomalous cancellation:
formula_1

Here, although the conclusion = is correct, there is a fallacious, invalid cancellation in the middle step. Another classical example of a howler is proving the Cayley–Hamilton theorem by simply substituting the scalar variables of the characteristic polynomial with the matrix.

Bogus proofs, calculations, or derivations constructed to produce a correct result in spite of incorrect logic or operations were termed &quot;howlers&quot; by Edwin Maxwell. Outside the field of mathematics the term &quot;howler&quot; has various meanings, generally less specific.

== Division by zero ==
The division-by-zero fallacy has many variants. The following example uses a disguised division by zero to &quot;prove&quot; that 2 = 1, but can be modified to prove that any number equals any other number.

# Let &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; be equal, nonzero quantities
#:formula_2
# Multiply by &quot;a&quot;
#:formula_3
# Subtract &quot;b&quot;2
#:formula_4
# Factor both sides: the left factors as a difference of squares, the right is factored by extracting &quot;b&quot; from both terms
#:formula_5
# Divide out (&quot;a&quot; − &quot;b&quot;)
#:formula_6
# Use the fact that &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot;
#:formula_7
# Combine like terms on the left
#:formula_8
# Divide by the non-zero &quot;b&quot;
#:formula_9
:&quot;Q.E.D.&quot;

The fallacy is in line 5: the progression from line 4 to line 5 involves division by &quot;a&quot; − &quot;b&quot;, which is zero since &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot;. Since division by zero is undefined, the argument is invalid.

==Analysis==
Mathematical analysis as the mathematical study of change and limits can lead to mathematical fallacies — if the properties of integrals and differentials are ignored. For instance, a naive use of integration by parts can be used to give a false proof that 0 = 1. Letting &quot;u&quot; =  and &quot;dv&quot; = , 

: formula_10

after which the antiderivatives may be cancelled yielding 0 = 1. The problem is that antiderivatives are only defined up to a constant and shifting them by 1 or indeed any number is allowed. The error really comes to light when we introduce arbitrary integration limits &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.

: formula_11

Since the difference between two values of a constant function vanishes, the same definite integral appears on both sides of the equation.

== Multivalued functions ==

Many functions do not have a unique inverse. For instance, while squaring a number gives a unique value, there are two possible square roots of a positive number. The square root is multivalued. One value can be chosen by convention as the principal value; in the case of the square root the non-negative value is the principal value, but there is no guarantee that the square root given as the principal value of the square of a number will be equal to the original number (e.g. the principal square root of the square of −2 is 2). This remains true for nth roots.

=== Positive and negative roots ===

Care must be taken when taking the square root of both sides of an equality. Failing to do so results in a &quot;proof&quot; of 5 = 4.

Proof:
:Start from
::formula_12
:Write this as
::formula_13
:Rewrite as
::formula_14
:Add on both sides:
::formula_15
:These are perfect squares:
::formula_16
:Take the square root of both sides:
::formula_17
:Add on both sides:
::formula_18
:&quot;Q.E.D.&quot;

The fallacy is in the second to last line, where the square root of both sides is taken: &quot;a&quot;2 = &quot;b&quot;2 only implies &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot; if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; have the same sign, which is not the case here. In this case, it implies that &quot;a&quot; = –&quot;b&quot;, so the equation should read
:formula_19
which, by adding on both sides, correctly reduces to 5 = 5.

Another example illustrating the danger of taking the square root of both sides of an equation involves the following fundamental identity
:formula_20
which holds as a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem. Then, by taking a square root,
:formula_21
Evaluating this when &quot;x&quot; =  , we get that
:formula_22
or
:formula_23
which is incorrect.

The error in each of these examples fundamentally lies in the fact that any equation of the form
:formula_24

where formula_25, has two solutions:
:formula_26
and it is essential to check which of these solutions is relevant to the problem at hand. In the above fallacy, the square root that allowed the second equation to be deduced from the first is valid only when cos &quot;x&quot; is positive. In particular, when &quot;x&quot; is set to , the second equation is rendered invalid.

=== Square roots of negative numbers ===

Invalid proofs utilizing powers and roots are often of the following kind:
:formula_27

The fallacy is that the rule formula_28 is generally valid only if at least one of formula_29 and &quot;formula_30&quot; is non-negative (when dealing with real numbers), which is not the case here.

Alternatively, imaginary roots are obfuscated in the following:

:formula_31

The error here lies in the incorrect usage of multiple-valued functions. formula_32 has two values formula_33 and formula_34 without a prior choice of branch, while formula_35 only denotes the principal value formula_33. Similarly, formula_37 has four different values formula_38, formula_33, formula_40, and formula_34, of which only formula_33 is equal to the left side of the first equality.

=== Complex exponents ===
When a number is raised to a complex power, the result is not uniquely defined (see ). If this property is not recognized, then errors such as the following can result:

:formula_43

The error here is that the rule of multiplying exponents as when going to the third line does not apply unmodified with complex exponents, even if when putting both sides to the power &quot;i&quot; only the principal value is chosen. When treated as multivalued functions, both sides produce the same set of values, being formula_44

== Geometry ==
Many mathematical fallacies in geometry arise from using an additive equality involving oriented quantities (such as adding vectors along a given line or adding oriented angles in the plane) to a valid identity, but which fixes only the absolute value of (one of) these quantities. This quantity is then incorporated into the equation with the wrong orientation, so as to produce an absurd conclusion. This wrong orientation is usually suggested implicitly by supplying an imprecise diagram of the situation, where relative positions of points or lines are chosen in a way that is actually impossible under the hypotheses of the argument, but non-obviously so.

In general, such a fallacy is easy to expose by drawing a precise picture of the situation, in which some relative positions will be different from those in the provided diagram. In order to avoid such fallacies, a correct geometric argument using addition or subtraction of distances or angles should always prove that quantities are being incorporated with their correct orientation.

=== Fallacy of the isosceles triangle ===

The fallacy of the isosceles triangle, from , purports to show that every triangle is isosceles, meaning that two sides of the triangle are congruent. This fallacy was known to Lewis Carroll and may have been discovered by him. It was published in 1899.

Given a triangle △ABC, prove that AB = AC:
# Draw a line bisecting ∠A.
# Draw the perpendicular bisector of segment BC, which bisects BC at a point D.
# Let these two lines meet at a point O.
# Draw line OR perpendicular to AB, line OQ perpendicular to AC.
# Draw lines OB and OC.
# By AAS, △RAO ≅ △QAO (∠ORA = ∠OQA = 90°; ∠RAO = ∠QAO; AO = AO (common side)).
# By RHS, △ROB ≅ △QOC (∠BRO = ∠CQO = 90°; BO = OC (hypotenuse); RO = OQ (leg)).
# Thus, AR = AQ, RB = QC, and AB = AR + RB = AQ + QC = AC.
&quot;Q.E.D.&quot;

As a corollary, one can show that all triangles are equilateral, by showing that AB = BC and AC = BC in the same way.

The error in the proof is the assumption in the diagram that the point O is &quot;inside&quot; the triangle. In fact, O always lies on the circumcircle of the △ABC (except for isosceles and equilateral triangles where AO and OD coincide). Furthermore, it can be shown that, if AB is longer than AC, then R will lie &quot;within&quot; AB, while Q will lie &quot;outside&quot; of AC, and vice versa (in fact, any diagram drawn with sufficiently accurate instruments will verify the above two facts). Because of this, AB is still AR + RB, but AC is actually AQ − QC; and thus the lengths are not necessarily the same.

== Proof by induction ==
There exist several fallacious proofs by induction in which one of the components, basis case or inductive step, is incorrect. Intuitively, proofs by induction work by arguing that if a statement is true in one case, it is true in the next case, and hence by repeatedly applying this, it can be shown to be true for all cases. The following &quot;proof&quot; shows that all horses are the same colour.

# Let us say that any group of &quot;N&quot; horses is all of the same colour.
# If we remove a horse from the group, we have a group of &quot;N&quot; − 1 horses of the same colour. If we add another horse, we have another group of &quot;N&quot; horses. By our previous assumption, all the horses are of the same colour in this new group, since it is a group of &quot;N&quot; horses.
# Thus we have constructed two groups of &quot;N&quot; horses all of the same colour, with &quot;N&quot; − 1 horses in common. Since these two groups have some horses in common, the two groups must be of the same colour as each other.
# Therefore, combining all the horses used, we have a group of &quot;N&quot; + 1 horses of the same colour.
# Thus if any &quot;N&quot; horses are all the same colour, any &quot;N&quot; + 1 horses are the same colour.
# This is clearly true for &quot;N&quot; = 1 (i.e., one horse is a group where all the horses are the same colour). Thus, by induction, &quot;N&quot; horses are the same colour for any positive integer &quot;N&quot;, and so all horses are the same colour.

The fallacy in this proof arises in line 3. For &quot;N&quot; = 1, the two groups of horses have &quot;N&quot; − 1 = 0 horses in common, and thus are not necessarily the same colour as each other, so the group of &quot;N&quot; + 1 = 2 horses is not necessarily all of the same colour. The implication &quot;every &quot;N&quot; horses are of the same colour, then &quot;N&quot; + 1 horses are of the same colour&quot; works for any &quot;N&quot; &gt; 1, but fails to be true when &quot;N&quot; = 1. The basis case is correct, but the induction step has a fundamental flaw.

<doc id="254366" wikidata="Q1058391" url="?curid=254366" title="Joseph I of Portugal">
<text>&quot;Dom&quot; Joseph I (, ; 6 June 1714 – 24 February 1777), known as the Reformer (Portuguese: &quot;o Reformador&quot;), was King of Portugal from 31 July 1750 until his death in 1777. Among other activities, Joseph was devoted to hunting and the opera. His government was controlled by Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal.

The third child and second son of King John V, Joseph became his father&#x27;s heir as an infant when his older brother, Pedro, Prince of Brazil, died. In 1729 he married Infanta Mariana Victoria, the eldest daughter of Philip V of Spain. Joseph and Mariana Victoria had four daughters: Maria, Mariana, Doroteia, and Benedita.

With the death of his father in 1750, Joseph became king of Portugal. His reign witnessed, among other things, a deadly earthquake in Lisbon in 1755 and a Spanish-French invasion of Portugal in 1762. The Lisbon earthquake allowed the Marquis of Pombal to consolidate power and also caused King Joseph to develop claustrophobia, refusing to live in a walled building ever again. Afterwards, Joseph moved his court into a series of tents. A new palace was built for him in Lisbon in the aftermath of the earthquake, but this was left uncompleted. Joseph died in 1777 and was succeeded by his eldest daughter, Queen Dona Maria I.

==Early life==
Joseph was the third child of King John V of Portugal and his wife Maria Anna of Austria. He had an older brother Pedro, Prince of Brazil, an older sister Barbara and three younger brothers. When his brother Pedro died in 1714 at the age of two, Joseph became heir apparent with the titles of Prince of Brazil and Duke of Braganza.

===Marriage===

On 19 January 1729, Joseph married Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain, daughter of King Philip V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnese, and his elder sister Barbara married King Philip&#x27;s son and heir, Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias (later King Ferdinand VI of Spain). The ceremony became known as the Exchange of the Princesses. Mariana Victoria loved music and hunting, just like her husband, but she was also a serious woman who disapproved of Joseph&#x27;s love affairs and did not hesitate to expose them to acquaintances. They had four daughters, all born before Joseph ascended the throne.

== Reign ==

Joseph succeeded to the Portuguese throne in 1750, when he was 36 years old, and almost immediately placed effective power in the hands of Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo (in 1770, the king made him Marquis of Pombal). Indeed, the history of Joseph&#x27;s reign is really that of the Marquis of Pombal himself. The king&#x27;s eldest daughter, Maria Francisca, became heir presumptive with the title of Princess of Brazil.

===Victory over Spain and France (1762)===
One of the most difficult situations faced by the king was the Franco-Spanish invasion of Portugal, in the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War (5 May-24 November 1762). France and Spain sent an ultimatum in order to force Portugal to abandon its alliance with Great Britain and close her ports to British ships. King Joseph refused to submit and asked for British help since both Portugal and its army were in a very poor condition, mainly because of the great 1755 Lisbon earthquake. England sent a force of 7,104 men led by John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun, and John Burgoyne, and also the exceptional military leader William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe, which reformed the Portuguese army and led the allied army of 14–15,000 men in a victorious war. The Bourbon invaders first led by Nicolás de Carvajal, Marquis of Sarriá, and then by Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolea, Count of Aranda, were thrice defeated by a combination of popular uprising, scorched earth strategy/famine and encircling movements by the regular Anglo-Portuguese troops, which like the militia, skilfully used the mountainous terrain to their advantage. The Spanish and French troops suffered staggering losses when they were driven out from Portugal and chased into Spain. As synthesized by historian Walter Dorn:

In South America, the war ended in a draw; the Portuguese took territory from Spain (most of the Rio Negro Valley) and defeated a Spanish invasion of Mato Grosso, while Spain conquered Colónia do Sacramento and the vast territory of Rio Grande do Sul (1763). The Treaty of Paris (1763) restored the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;. The rich and huge territory of Rio Grande do Sul would be retaken from the Spanish army during the undeclared war of 1763-1777.

=== Marquis of Pombal ===
The powerful Marquis of Pombal sought to overhaul all aspects of economic, social and colonial policy to make Portugal a more efficient contender with the other great powers of Europe, and thus enhance his own political stature. A supposed conspiracy of nobles aimed at murdering King Joseph and Pombal gave him the opportunity (some say the pretext) to neutralize the Távora family in the Távora affair and to expel the Jesuits in September 1759, thus gaining control of public education and a wealth of church lands and ushering Portugal into the Age of the Enlightenment.

== Legacy and death ==
Joseph&#x27;s reign is also noteworthy for the Lisbon earthquake, firestorm and tsunami of 1 November 1755, in which between 30,000 and 40,000 people died. The earthquake caused Joseph to develop a severe case of claustrophobia, and he was never again comfortable living within a walled building. Consequently, he moved the royal court to an extensive complex of tents in the hills of Ajuda. 

The Project for the Royal Palace in Campo de Ourique was an ambitious palatial complex planned for the Campo de Ourique neighborhood of Lisbon, but later abandoned due to a lack of impetus from the Portuguese royal family and a prioritization of other reconstruction efforts. The capital was eventually rebuilt at great cost, and an equestrian statue of King Joseph still dominates the Praça do Comércio, Lisbon&#x27;s main plaza.
With Joseph&#x27;s death on 24 February 1777, the throne passed to his daughter, Queen Dona Maria I, and his brother and son-in-law, King Dom Peter III. Pombal&#x27;s iron rule was sharply brought to an end, because Maria disliked him since she had been heavily influenced by the Portuguese old nobility that strongly opposed Pombal.

==Issue==
Joseph I fathered four daughters by his wife Mariana Victoria, and there were also four stillbirths. Of their four daughters, only the eldest had issue:

#Maria Francisca Isabel Rita Gertrudes Joanna (17 December 1734 – 20 March 1816), married her uncle Infante Peter of Portugal, with issue. After her father&#x27;s death, she became the first queen regnant of Portugal as Dona Maria I.
#Maria Ana Francisca Dorotea Josefa Antonia Gertrudes Rita Joanna Efigenia (7 October 1736 – 6 May 1813), potential bride for Louis, Dauphin of France, son and heir of King Louis XV. However, Maria Ana&#x27;s mother refused to consent to the marriage, and the infanta died unmarried.
#Stillborn son (February 1739).
#Maria Francisca Doroteia Josefa Antónia Gertrudes Rita Joanna Efigénia de Braganca (21 September 1739 – 14 January 1771), potential bride for the French nobleman and revolutionary Philippe Égalité, but she refused to marry him and died unmarried.
#Stillborn daughter (7 March 1742).
#Stillborn daughter (15 October 1742).
#Stillborn daughter (May 1744).
#Maria Francisca Benedita Ana Isabel Joanna Antonia Laurencia Inacia Teresa Gertrudes Rita Rosa (25 July 1746 – 18 August 1829) married her nephew Dom Joseph, Prince of Brazil, no issue.

<doc id="254379" wikidata="Q773874" url="?curid=254379" title="Maria I of Portugal">
<text>&quot;Dona&quot; Maria I (17 December 1734 – 20 March 1816) was Queen of Portugal from 24 February 1777 until her death in 1816. Known as Maria the Pious in Portugal and Maria the Mad in Brazil, she was the first undisputed queen regnant of Portugal and the first monarch of Brazil.

Maria was the eldest daughter of King Dom José I (Joseph I) of Portugal and Queen Mariana Victoria. As the heir to the throne, she held the titles of Princess of Brazil and Duchess of Braganza. She married her uncle Infante Pedro (Peter) in 1760. They had six children, of whom three survived infancy: José, João (John), and Mariana Vitória. The death of King José in 1777 placed Maria, then 42 years old, on the throne. Her husband Pedro was nominally king alongside her as Dom Pedro III.

Upon ascending the throne, Maria dismissed her father&#x27;s powerful chief minister, Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal. The early part of Maria&#x27;s reign witnessed growth in Portugal&#x27;s economy. Maria had a number of national buildings constructed and renovated, leading to the completion of the Palace of Queluz and the inauguration of the Palace of Ajuda and other new monuments. The death of her husband in 1786, followed by the deaths in 1788 of her eldest son, José, and her confessor Inácio de São Caetano, caused the queen to develop clinical depression. Her second son, João, then served as prince regent. With Napoleon&#x27;s European conquests, Maria and her court moved to the Portuguese colony of Brazil in 1807. After Brazil was elevated to a kingdom in 1815, Maria became Queen of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Upon her death in 1816, she was succeeded by her son Dom João VI.

==Early life==

Maria was born at the Ribeira Palace in Lisbon on 17 December 1734 and baptized Maria Francisca Isabel Josefa Antónia Gertrudes Rita Joana. She was the eldest of four daughters born to Dom José (Joseph), Prince of Brazil (later King Dom José I of Portugal), and Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain. Her father José was the eldest surviving son of the reigning King Dom João V (John V) of Portugal. Her mother, Mariana Victoria, was the eldest daughter of King Don Felipe V (Philip V) of Spain. Maria&#x27;s paternal grandfather João V appointed her Princess of Beira on the day of her birth.

Maria&#x27;s grandfather died on 31 July 1750. Her father, Prince José, then succeeded to the throne as Dom José I. As José&#x27;s eldest child, Maria became his heir presumptive and was given the traditional titles of Princess of Brazil and Duchess of Braganza.

===Influence of the Marquis of Pombal===
King José&#x27;s government was dominated completely by Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal. The Marquis of Pombal secured control of the government after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, in which around 100,000 people lost their lives. The palace of Maria&#x27;s birth was also destroyed in the disaster.

After the earthquake, King José was often uncomfortable at the thought of staying in enclosed spaces, and later experienced claustrophobia. The king had a palace built in Ajuda, away from the city centre. This palace became known as Real Barraca de Ajuda (Royal Hut at Ajuda) because it was made of wood. The family spent much time at the large palace. (The palace was the birthplace of Maria&#x27;s first child, José, .) In 1794 the palace burned to the ground and the Palace of Ajuda was built in its place.

On 6 June 1760, Maria married the king&#x27;s younger brother, her uncle Pedro (later King Dom Pedro III of Portugal). Maria and Pedro had six children: José, João Francisco, João (later King Dom João VI), Mariana Vitória, Maria Clementina, and Maria Isabel. Only José, João, and Mariana Vitória survived to adulthood. Maria also delivered a stillborn boy in 1762.

==Reign==

King José died on 24 February 1777. His daughter, Maria, then became the first undisputed queen regnant of Portugal. With Maria&#x27;s accession, her husband became nominal king as Dom Pedro III, but the actual regal authority was vested solely in Maria, as she was the lineal heir of the crown. Also, as Pedro&#x27;s kingship was &quot;jure uxoris&quot; only, his reign would cease in the event of Maria&#x27;s death, and the crown would pass to Maria&#x27;s descendants. However, Pedro predeceased his wife in 1786. Maria is considered to have been a good ruler in the period prior to her madness. Her first act as queen was to dismiss the autocratic minister, the Marquis of Pombal. Noteworthy events of this period include Portugal&#x27;s membership in the League of Armed Neutrality (July 1782) and the 1781 cession of Delagoa Bay from Austria to Portugal. However, the queen suffering from melancholia and declining mental health (perhaps due to porphyria) made her incapable of handling state affairs after 1792.

On 5 January 1785 the queen issued a charter imposing heavy restrictions on industrial activity in Brazil; how, for example, it prohibited the manufacture of fabrics and other products, extinguishing all textile manufactures in the colony, except the industry of coarse cloth for the use of slaves and workers; since the Portuguese colonial administration did not look favorably on the development of industrial activities in Brazil for fear of economic and, perhaps, political independence. During her reign, the trial, conviction and execution of ensign Joaquim José da Silva Xavier, known as Tiradentes, took place in 1789.

==Mental deterioration==

Maria&#x27;s madness was first officially noticed in 1786, when she had to be carried back to her apartments in a state of delirium. Afterwards, the queen&#x27;s mental state became progressively worse. On 25 May 1786, her husband died; Maria was devastated and forbade any court entertainments. According to a contemporary account, state festivities began to resemble religious ceremonies. The queen&#x27;s eldest son and heir, Prince Dom José, died aged 27 from smallpox on 11 September 1788, and that same year, on November 2, her daughter Mariana Vitória died a few days after giving birth to her third child from from the same illness as her brother at just 19. The queen&#x27;s confessor, Inácio de São Caetano, Titular Archbishop of Salonica, died almost four weeks later. These deaths may have resulted in Queen Maria developing major depressive disorder. Another potential cause was her incestuous ancestry; this is substantiated by two of her sisters having had similar conditions.

In February 1792, Maria was deemed insane and was treated by Francis Willis, the same physician who attended the British king George III. Willis wanted to take her to England, but the plan was refused by the Portuguese court. Potentially as a result of Willis&#x27; more advisory role in Maria&#x27;s care, rather than the hands-on care of King George III, Willis deemed the queen incurable. Maria&#x27;s second son, Dom João (John), now Prince of Brazil, took over the government in her name, even though he only took the title of Prince Regent in 1799. When the Real Barraca de Ajuda burnt down in 1794, the court was forced to move to Queluz, where the ill queen would lie in her apartments all day. Visitors would complain of terrible screams that would echo throughout the palace.

== Napoleonic Wars ==
In 1801, Spanish Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy sent an army to invade Portugal with backing from the French leader Napoleon, resulting in the War of the Oranges. Though the Spanish ended their invasion, the Treaty of Badajoz on 6 June 1801 forced Portugal to cede Olivença and other border towns to Spain. (This cession is not recognized by the present Portuguese government, and the country officially considers those territories still to be Portuguese possessions.) On 29 September, Prince Dom João signed the Treaty of Madrid (1801), ceding half of Portuguese Guyana to France, which became French Guiana.

The refusal of the Portuguese government to join the French-sponsored Continental Blockade against Britain culminated in the late 1807 Franco-Spanish invasion of Portugal led by General Jean-Andoche Junot. The ultimate Napoleonic plan for Portugal was to split it into three sections. The northern parts of Portugal, from the Douro to the Minho, would become the Kingdom of Northern Lusitania, and its throne was promised to King Louis II of Etruria. The Alentejo Province and Kingdom of the Algarve would be merged to form the &quot;Principality of the Algarves&quot;, of which Manuel de Godoy would be sovereign. The remaining portion of Portugal would have been directly ruled by France.

=== Transfer to Brazil ===
At the urging of the British government, the entire House of Braganza decided to flee on 29 November 1807 to establish a government in exile in the Portuguese Viceroyalty of Brazil. Along with the royal family, Maria was transported aboard the carrack &quot;Príncipe Real&quot;. During her move from the royal palace to the docks, she was heard screaming throughout the trip in the middle of the crowd and in the carriage. The queen&#x27;s dementia was so great that she feared that she was going to be tortured or robbed during her movement by her servants.

In January 1808, Prince Regent João and his court arrived in Salvador da Bahia. Under pressure by local aristocracy and the British, the prince regent signed a commercial regulation after his arrival that opened commerce between Brazil and friendly nations, which in this case represented the interests of Great Britain above all. This law broke an important colonial pact that had previously allowed Brazil to maintain direct commercial relations only with Portugal.

On 1 August, British General Arthur Wellesley (later Duke of Wellington) landed a British army in Lisbon to initiate the Peninsular War. The impact of Wellesley&#x27;s initial victory over Junot at the Battle of Vimeiro (21 August 1808) was wiped out by his superiors in the Convention of Cintra (30 August 1808), which allowed the defeated French troops to evacuate peacefully from Portugal.

Wellesley (soon to be made Lord Wellington) returned to Portugal on 22 April 1809 to recommence the campaign. Portuguese forces under British command distinguished themselves in the defence of the Lines of Torres Vedras (1809–1810) and in the subsequent invasion of Spain and France. In 1815, Prince João&#x27;s government elevated Brazil to the status of a kingdom, and Maria was proclaimed Queen of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. When Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815, Maria and her family remained in Brazil.

== Death and legacy ==
Maria lived in Brazil for a total of eight years, always in a state of incapacitation. On 20 March 1816, she died at the Carmo Convent in Rio de Janeiro at the age of 81. After her death, the prince regent was acclaimed as King Dom João VI. In 1821, Maria&#x27;s body was returned to Lisbon to be interred in a mausoleum in the Estrela Basilica (), which she had helped found.

Maria is a greatly admired figure in both Brazil and Portugal due to the tremendous changes and events that took place during her reign. In Portugal, she is celebrated as a strong female figure. Her legacy shines at Portugal&#x27;s Queluz Palace, a baroque-roccoco masterpiece that she helped conceive. A large statue of her stands in front of the palace, and a pousada near the palace is named in her honour. A large marble statue of the queen was erected at the Portuguese National Library in Lisbon by the students of Joaquim Machado de Castro.

In Brazil, Maria is admired as a key figure in the eventual independence of Brazil. It was during her reign, albeit through the government of her son&#x27;s regency, that many of the national institutions and organizations in Brazil were created. These institutions were the precursors to their modern-day equivalents and granted large degree of power to the Brazilian colonials. While she is often called &quot;A Louca&quot; (the Mad) in Brazil, Brazilian and Portuguese historians hold her in high esteem.

== Marriage and issue ==
Maria married her uncle Pedro on 6 June 1760. At the time of their marriage, Maria was 25 and Pedro was 42. Despite the age gap, the couple had a happy marriage. Upon Maria&#x27;s accession in 1777, her husband became the nominal King Dom Pedro III of Portugal. They had six children:

<text>A moving walkway, also known as an autowalk, moving pavement, moving sidewalk, travolator, or travelator (British English), is a slow-moving conveyor mechanism that transports people across a horizontal or inclined plane over a short to medium distance. Moving walkways can be used by standing or walking on them. They are often installed in pairs, one for each direction.

== History ==

The first moving walkway debuted at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, Illinois, in the United States as &quot;The Great Wharf Moving Sidewalk.&quot; Designed by architect Joseph Lyman Silsbee, it had two sections: one where passengers were seated, and one where they could stand or walk. It ran in a loop down the length of a lakefront pier to a casino. 

Six years later, another moving walkway was presented to the public at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris as the &quot;Rue de l&#x27;Avenir&quot;. It consisted of three elevated platforms—the first stationary, the second moving at a moderate speed, and the third moving at about . These demonstrations likely inspired some of H. G. Wells&#x27; settings mentioned in the &quot;Science Fiction&quot; section below.
&quot;The Beeler Organization&quot;, a New York City consulting firm, proposed a Continuous Transit System with Sub-Surface Moving Platforms for Atlanta in 1924, with a design roughly similar to the Paris Exposition system. The proposed drive system used a linear induction motor. The system was not constructed.

The Speedwalk, the first commercial moving walkway in the United States was installed in 1954 in Jersey City, New Jersey, inside the Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad Erie station at the Pavonia Terminal. Built by Goodyear, it was long and moved up a 10% grade at . It was removed a few years later when traffic patterns at the station changed.

The first moving walkway in an airport was installed in 1958 at Love Field in Dallas, Texas. On January 1, 1960, Tina Marie Brandon, age 2, was killed on the moving sidewalk.

Moving walkways generally move at a slower speed than a natural walking pace, and when people step onto one, they tend to slow their pace to compensate; thus moving walkways only minimally improve travel times and overall transport capacity.

== Designs ==
Moving walkways are built in one of two basic styles:
* Pallet type – a continuous series of flat metal plates join together to form a walkway – and are effectively identical to escalators in their construction. Most have a metal surface, though some models have a rubber surface for extra traction. The plates are one-piece, die-cast aluminium pallets, with a typical width between the walkway sides of . The walkway can be powered by an AC induction motor. Example speed is .
* Moving belt – these are generally built with mesh metal belts or rubber walking surfaces over metal rollers. The walking surface may have a solid feel or a &quot;bouncy&quot; feel.

Both types of moving walkway have a grooved surface to mesh with combplates at the ends. Also, nearly all moving walkways are built with moving handrails similar to those on escalators.

=== High-speed walkways ===
====Early examples====
In 1961, Jim Downer designed and had produced by Dunlop, the first flat running &#x27;Travelator&#x27; for a BBC exhibition in Charing Cross underground station.

In the 1970s, Dunlop developed the &quot;Speedaway&quot; system. It was in fact an invention by Gabriel Bouladon and Paul Zuppiger of the Battelle Memorial Institute at their former Geneva, Switzerland facility. A prototype was built and demonstrated at the Battelle Institute in Geneva in the early 1970s, as can be attested by a (French-speaking) Swiss television program entitled Un Jour une Heure aired in October 1974. The great advantage of the Speedaway, as compared to the then existing systems, was that the embarking/disembarking zone was both wide and slow-moving (up to four passengers could embark simultaneously, equating to around 10,000 per hour), whereas the transportation zone was narrower and fast-moving.

The entrance to the system was like a very wide escalator, with broad metal tread plates of a parallelogram shape. After a short distance the tread plates were accelerated to one side, sliding past one another to form progressively into a narrower but faster-moving track which travelled at almost a right angle to the entry section. The passenger was accelerated through a parabolic path to a maximum design speed . The experience was unfamiliar to passengers, who needed to understand how to use the system to be able to do so safely. Developing a moving hand-rail for the system presented a challenge, also solved by the Battelle team. The Speedaway was intended to be used as a stand-alone system over short distances or to form acceleration and deceleration units providing entry and exit means for a parallel conventional (but fast-running) &quot;Starglide&quot; walkway which covered longer distances. The system was still in development in 1975 but never went into commercial production.

Another attempt at an accelerated walkway in the 1980s was the TRAX (&quot;Trottoir Roulant Accéléré&quot;), which was developed by Dassault and RATP and whose prototype was installed at Invalides station in Paris. The speed at entry and exit was , while the maximum speed was . It was a technical failure due to its complexity, and was never commercially exploited.

In the mid-1990s, the Loderway Moving Walkway company patented and licensed a design to a number of larger moving walkway manufacturers. Trial systems were installed at Flinders Street railway station in Melbourne and Brisbane Airport Australia. These met with a positive response from the public, but no permanent installations were made. This system is of the belt type, with a sequence of belts moving at different speeds to accelerate and decelerate riders. A sequence of different speed handrails is also used.

====Trottoir roulant rapide (TRR)====

In 2002, CNIM designed and installed the experimental, &quot;&quot; high-speed walkway in the Montparnasse–Bienvenüe station in France. At first it operated at a speed of but was later reduced to due to safety concerns. As the design of the walkway requires riders to have at least one hand free to hold the handrail, those carrying bags, shopping, etc., or who are infirm or physically disabled, must use the ordinary walkway beside it, and staff were positioned at each end to determine who could and who could not use it.

Using this walkway is similar to using any other moving walkway, except that there are special procedures to follow when entering or exiting at either end. On entering, there is a acceleration zone where the &quot;ground&quot; is a series of metal rollers. Riders stand still with both feet on these rollers and use one hand to hold the handrail and let it pull them so that they glide over the rollers. The idea is to accelerate the riders so that they will be traveling fast enough to step onto the moving walkway belt. Riders who try to walk on these rollers are at significant risk of falling over. Once on the walkway, riders can stand or walk as on an ordinary moving walkway. At the exit, the same technique is used to decelerate the riders. Users step onto a series of rollers which decelerate them slowly, rather than the abrupt halt which would otherwise take place.

The walkway proved to be unreliable, leading to many users losing their balance and having accidents. Consequently, it was removed by RATP in 2011 after nine years in service, being replaced with a standard moving walkway.

====ThyssenKrupp ACCEL====

In 2007, ThyssenKrupp installed two high-speed walkways in Terminal 1 at Toronto Pearson International Airport. They connect the international gates in the newly opened Pier F, located at one end of the pier, with the rest of the terminal. One walkway serves departing passengers travelling towards the gates and the other serves arriving passengers travelling towards the terminal. The airport decided to decommission the walkway in 2020.

The walkway&#x27;s pallet-type design accelerates and decelerates users in a manner that eliminates many of the safety risks generated by the moving belt-type used in Paris, making it suitable for use by people of all ages and sizes regardless of their health condition. The pallets &quot;intermesh&quot; with a comb and slot arrangement. They expand out of each other when speeding up, and compress into each other when slowing down. The handrails work in a similar manner, and because of this, there is no need to hold the handrails when entering or exiting the walkway. It moves at roughly when riders step onto it and speeds up to approximately , which it remains at until near the end, where it slows back down.

ThyssenKrupp continued development of that product, and the result is &quot;Accel&quot;, an upgraded version of &quot;Express Walkway&quot;, offering speeds of up to , which is faster than of &quot;Express Walkway&quot;, and is the same speed as of original version of TRR walkway.

=== Inclined moving walkways === 

An inclined moving walkway is a type of vertical transportation used in airports and supermarkets to move people to another floor with the convenience of an elevator (namely, that people can take along their suitcase trolley, shopping cart, or baby carriage) and the capacity of an escalator. Conflicting sources name either Goodyear Tire or Canadian elevator company Turnbull as the inventor of the inclined moving walkway.

Some department stores instead use shopping cart conveyors to transport passengers and their carts between store levels simultaneously. Walmart in Canada require users of wheelchairs and other mobility aids to be accompanied by shop staff when using their moving walkways, which they refer to as &#x27;movators&#x27;. This policy has been superseded in some stores by the installation of elevators.

Shopping carts used on inclined moving walkways usually have wheels specially designed to get caught in the grooves of the walkway&#x27;s tread when rolled onto the walkway, thereby preventing the cart from rolling down. The wheels are lifted off the tread by the landing plate at the end.

== Applications ==

Moving walkways are frequently found in the following locations:

=== Airports ===

Moving walkways are commonly used in larger airports, as passengers – often with heavy luggage in tow – typically need to walk considerable distances. Moving walkways may be used:
* in passageways between concourses and the terminal
* within particularly long concourses
* as a connector between terminals, or
* as access to a parking facility or a ground transport station.

Of particular note is the Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France, which has several moving walkways inside a series of futuristic suspended tubes.

=== Public transport ===
Moving walkways can be useful for lengthier connections between lines or platforms; for example:

*London Underground (London): on the Waterloo &amp; City line terminus at Bank station and on the Jubilee Line at Waterloo
*Glasgow Subway (Glasgow): from Buchanan Street subway station to Queen Street railway station
*MTR (Hong Kong): between Central and Hong Kong stations on Hong Kong Island, and between Tsim Sha Tsui and East Tsim Sha Tsui stations in Kowloon
*MRT (Singapore): in Bugis, Dhoby Ghaut, Serangoon, Botanic Gardens, Orchard, Woodlands North, Outram Park and Changi Airport stations
*Chongqing Rail Transit/CRT(Chongqing): Moving walkways inside Jiaochangkou station&#x27;s interchange channel for transfers between Line 1 and Line 2.
* Montreal Metro, the entrance of the Beaudry station

A moving walkway was formerly part of the complex in Spadina subway station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Installed in 1978, it reduced the travel time needed to transfer between the platforms on the Bloor–Danforth and the Yonge–University–Spadina lines. They were removed in 2004 and patrons are now required to walk between the stations.

=== Urban areas ===
Moving walkways have been heavily incorporated into Hong Kong&#x27;s system of Central–Mid-Levels escalators.
=== Museums ===
Moving sidewalks may be used:
* to ensure that a museum exhibit is viewed in a certain sequence
* to provide a particular aesthetic effect in an exhibit
* to make sure the crowd moves through at a reliable pace.

The 1975–76 American Freedom Train did this with a moving walkway inside each successive railroad car, thus maximizing the number of people who could view the interior exhibits in the limited time the train was stopped in each town.

The National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, US, uses a moving walkway to connect the two main buildings.

The Tower of London in London, England, uses a moving walkway where visitors are passing the cabinets which contain the Crown Jewels.

=== Zoos ===
Similar to museums, some zoological park exhibits have a moving walkway to ease guests through an animal display or habitat. An aquarium at the Mall of America does this with a moving walkway made up of specially rounded pallets that enable it to change directions en route. The San Diego Zoo uses moving ramps to help guests ascend steep grades.

=== Theme parks ===
Some amusement park rides, such as continuous-motion dark rides like Disney&#x27;s Omnimover rides, make use of a moving sidewalk to assist passengers in boarding and disembarking rides and attractions. Some examples include:
* the Ultra Twister, a roller coaster at the now closed Astroworld in Houston, Texas, had a moving walkway with no handrail for passengers to step on prior to boarding their car. The walkway would move at the same speed as the approaching cars, allowing passengers completing the ride to step off and for boarding passengers to enter the car. An announcement played &quot;Moving conveyor, please watch your step&quot; to warn of the moving walkway.
* the exit from the Space Mountain attraction at Walt Disney World Resort formerly had a long moving walkway which changed inclination multiple times. As of November 15, 2018, it has been converted to conventional flooring.
* the exit from the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Walt Disney World has an inclined moving walkway leading towards a gift shop.
* the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover attraction at Walt Disney World Resort has two inclined moving walkways to carry guests between the ground level and the attraction&#x27;s load and unload stations, where guests step onto another moving walkway that is one of the few circular moving walkways

=== Theatrical sets ===
&quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; by Andrew Lloyd Webber uses a travelator in the number &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (act one, scene six), to give the illusion the Phantom and Christine are traveling the catacombs below the Paris Opera House a great distance to the Phantom&#x27;s lair on the subterranean lake.

=== Ski resorts ===

Moving walkways known as magic carpets are also used in ski resorts. Skiers can place their skis on the walkway, which is designed to provide a strong level of grip. Since the walkways cannot be too steep and are slow compared to other aerial lifts, they are used especially for beginners or to transport people over a short uphill distance, such as to reach a restaurant or another lift&#x27;s station. Moving walkways can also be found at the entrances of chairlifts to help passengers in the boarding process.

=== Retail ===

In the UK, inclined travelators are used in stores, including Asda, B&amp;M Bargains, IKEA, Marks &amp; Spencer, Morrisons, Sainsbury&#x27;s, and Tesco. For example, Tesco in Aberystwyth uses six inclined travelators (three up, three down in a criss-cross layout) to transport shoppers and their trolleys between the store, the rooftop car park and the under-store car park.

In the United States, inclined walkways can be found in certain IKEA, Menards, Publix, H-E-B, Wegmans, Costco Wholesale, and Whole Foods Market stores.

== Safety ==
When in operation, travelators have similar safety risks to traditional escalators, with the most common injuries on travelators being caused by tripping or falling over, and thus typically have similar guidelines to escalators to use them safely.

== Science fiction ==

The concept of a megalopolis based on high-speed walkways is common in science fiction. The first works set in such a location are &quot;A Story of the Days To Come&quot; (1897) and &quot;When The Sleeper Wakes&quot; (1899) (also republished as &quot;The Sleeper Awakes&quot;), written by H. G. Wells, which take place in a future London. Thirty years later, the silent film &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927) depicted several scenes showing moving sidewalks and escalators between skyscrapers at high levels. Later, the short story &quot;The Roads Must Roll&quot; (1940), written by Robert A. Heinlein, depicts the risk of a transportation strike in a society based on similar-speed sidewalks. The novel is part of the &quot;Future History&quot; saga, and takes place in 1976. Isaac Asimov, in the novel &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; (1954) and its sequels in the &quot;Robot&quot; series, uses similar enormous underground cities with a similar sidewalk system. The period described is about the year 5,000.

In each of these cases, there is a massive network of parallel moving belts, the inner ones moving faster. Passengers are screened from wind, and there are chairs and even shops on the belt. In the Heinlein work the fast lane runs at , and the first &quot;mechanical road&quot; was built in 1960 between Cincinnati and Cleveland. The relative speed of two adjacent belts is (in the book, the fast lane stops while the second lane keeps running at ). In the Wells and Asimov works there are more steps in the speed scale and the speeds are less extreme.

In Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s novel, &quot;Against the Fall of Night&quot; (later rewritten as &quot;The City and the Stars&quot;) the Megacity of Diaspar is interwoven with &quot;moving ways&quot; which, unlike Heinlein&#x27;s conveyor belts, are solid floors that can mysteriously move as a fluid. In the novel, Clarke writes, 
In his non-fiction book &quot;Profiles of the Future&quot;, Arthur C. Clarke mentions moving sidewalks but made of some sort of anisotropic material that could flow in the direction of travel but hold the weight of a person. The fluid would have the advantage of offering a continuous gradient of speed from the edge to edge so there would be no jumps, and simply moving from side to side would effect a change in speed.

In the Strugatsky brothers&#x27; &quot;Noon Universe&quot;, the worldwide network of moving roads is one of the first megaprojects undertaken on newly united Earth, before the advent of FTL starships and its consequences turned everybody&#x27;s attention to the stars. These roads there are quasiliving organisms similar to Clarke&#x27;s description and were used for both local commuting and long-distance non-urgent transport until their use was eclipsed by an instant teleportation network.

The animated TV series &quot;The Jetsons&quot; depicts moving walkways everywhere, even in private homes.

=== Slidewalk ===
A &quot;slidewalk&quot; is a fictional moving pavement structurally sound enough to support buildings and large populations of travelers. Adjacent slidewalks moving at different rates could let travelers accelerate to great speeds. The term is also used colloquially for a conventional moving walkway.

They were imagined by science fiction writer H. G. Wells in &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;. Robert A. Heinlein made them the instruments of social upheaval in the 1940 short story &quot;The Roads Must Roll&quot;. Isaac Asimov, in his &quot;Robot&quot; series, imagined slidewalks as the potential method of transportation of practically the entire urban population on Earth, with &quot;expressways&quot; moving at up to equipped with seating accommodations for long-distance travel, and with slower subsidiary tracks branching off from the main lines. Arthur C. Clarke also used them in &quot;The City and the Stars&quot;. Larry Niven used them in Ringworld and &quot;Flatlander&quot;. Slidewalks figure prominently in &quot;The Jetsons&quot;.

<text>Potentilla is a genus containing over 500 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae.

Potentillas may also be called cinquefoils in English, but they have also been called five fingers and silverweeds. Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (&quot;P. erecta&quot;). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to &quot;P. sterilis&quot; in particular, or to the closely related &quot;Waldsteinia fragarioides&quot;. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera – notably the popular garden shrub &quot;P. fruticosa&quot;, now &quot;Dasiphora fruticosa&quot;.

Potentillas are generally found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some occur in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands.

==Description==

Typical cinquefoils look most similar to strawberries, but differ in usually having dry, inedible fruit (hence the name &quot;barren strawberry&quot; for some species). Many cinquefoil species have palmate leaves. Some species have just three leaflets, while others have fifteen or more leaflets arranged pinnately. The flowers are usually yellow, but may be white, pinkish or red. The accessory fruits are usually dry but may be fleshy and strawberry-like, while the actual seeds – each one technically a single fruit – are tiny nuts.

==Taxonomy==

Among the Rosaceae, cinquefoils are close relatives of avens (genus &quot;Geum&quot;) and roses (&quot;Rosa&quot;), and even closer relatives of agrimonies (&quot;Agrimonia&quot;). Yet more closely related to &quot;Potentilla&quot; are lady&#x27;s mantles (&quot;Alchemilla&quot;) and strawberries (&quot;Fragaria&quot;). &quot;Dryas&quot; is a more distantly related genus, long-held beliefs notwithstanding.

Analysis of internal transcribed spacer DNA sequence data has yielded valuable information on cinquefoil relationships, supporting previous hypotheses as to their descent, but also resulting in a number of changes to the circumscription of &quot;Potentilla&quot;.

The horkelias, mousetails, and mock-strawberries formerly classified in the genera &quot;Horkelia&quot;, &quot;Ivesia, and Duchesnea&quot; are now all included in the genus &quot;Potentilla&quot;. Conversely, the shrubby plants previously included in this genus are now separated in the genus &quot;Dasiphora&quot;, while some distinctive and apparently protocarnivorous herbaceous cinquefoils are placed in &quot;Drymocallis&quot;. The marsh cinquefoil is now in the genus &quot;Comarum&quot;, and the three-toothed cinquefoil makes up the monotypic genus &quot;Sibbaldiopsis&quot;. As already proposed by John Hill in the 18th-5century, the silverweeds of genus &quot;Argentina&quot; may be distinct, but as the immediate sister genus of &quot;Potentilla&quot;, its boundary is still unclear.

===Subdivision===
Estimates of the number of valid species in this large genus depend on the circumscription used, and over 500 species are currently recognised by Plants of the World Online.

See the list of &quot;Potentilla&quot; species.

*&quot;Drymocallis&quot;
*&quot;Sibbaldiopsis&quot;

===Etymology===
&quot;Cinquefoil&quot; in the &quot;Middle English Dictionary&quot; is described as &quot;Pentafilon – from Greek &quot;Pentaphyllon&quot; – influenced by foil, a leaf. The European cinquefoil (&quot;Potentilla reptans&quot;), often used medicinally.&quot; The word is derived from Old French &quot;cinc&quot;, Middle English &quot;cink&quot; and ultimately Latin &quot;quinque&quot; – all meaning &quot;five&quot; –, and &quot;feuille&quot; and &quot;foil/foille&quot; which mean &quot;leaf&quot;. Formerly this term referred to five-leaved plants in general. In medieval times, the word &quot;cinquefoil&quot; was used almost exclusively in England. In France, the genus was called &quot;quintefeuille&quot;, first attested in Normandy and Brittany in the 11th-century.

The scientific name &quot;Potentilla&quot; seems to have been influenced by a fusion of ancient names for these plants. Common tormentil, &quot;P. erecta&quot;, was known as &quot;tormentilla&quot; in medieval Latin, derived from early Spanish – literally &quot;a little torment&quot;, meaning pain that, while not debilitating, is unpleasant and persistent (such as a stomach ache, against which &quot;P. erecta&quot; was used). The change from initial &quot;t&quot; to &quot;p&quot; seems to have been influenced by terms such as &quot;poterium&quot; – Latin for the related burnets (genus &quot;Sanguisorba&quot;) – or &quot;propedila&quot; and similar words used for the European cinquefoil (&quot;P. reptans&quot;) in the now-extinct Dacian language, as attested in Latin herbals.

In another medieval dictionary the French word &quot;potentille&quot; is defined as a &quot;wild Tansie, a silver weed&quot;, a reference to the tansy (&quot;Tanacetum vulgare&quot;) and similar taxa of the genus &quot;Tanacetum&quot;. The related adjective &quot;potentiel/potentiells&quot; means &quot;strong&quot;, &quot;forcible&quot;, or &quot;powerful in operation&quot;. Its origin is the French &quot;potence&quot; (&quot;strong&quot;, &quot;powerful&quot;, &quot;mighty&quot;, or &quot;potent&quot;). The origin of these words is the Latin &quot;potens&quot;, with the same meaning.

==Distribution and habitat==
Cinquefoils grow wild in most cool and cold regions of the world. Most species are herbaceous perennials but a few are erect or creeping shrubs. Some are troublesome weeds. Other types are grown in gardens.

==Ecology==
Cinquefoils are a prominent part of many ecosystems. In the United Kingdom alone, common tormentil (&quot;P. erecta&quot;) together with purple moor grass (&quot;Molinia caerulea&quot;) defines many grassy mires, and grows abundantly in the typical deciduous forest with downy birch (&quot;Betula pubescens&quot;), common wood sorrel (&quot;Oxalis acetosella&quot;), and sessile oak (&quot;Quercus petraea&quot;). In upland pastures on calcareous soil it typically accompanies common bent (&quot;Agrostis capillaris&quot;), sheep&#x27;s fescue (&quot;Festuca ovina&quot;), and wild thyme (&quot;Thymus praecox&quot;). It is most commonly seen in regions dominated by common heather (&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;), including common lowland heaths with bell heather (&quot;Erica cinerea&quot;), maritime heaths with spring squill (&quot;Scilla verna&quot;), submontane heaths dominated by red peat moss (&quot;Sphagnum capillifolium&quot;) and common bilberry (&quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot;), and the mountain heathlands of Scotland with alpine juniper (&quot;Juniperus communis&quot; ssp. &quot;alpina&quot;).

The leaves of cinquefoils are eaten by the caterpillars of many Lepidoptera, notably the grizzled skippers (genus &quot;Pyrgus&quot;), butterflies of the skipper family. Adult butterflies and moths visit cinquefoil flowers; for example, the endangered Karner blue butterfly (&quot;Plebejus melissa samuelis&quot;) takes nectar from common cinquefoil (&quot;P. simplex&quot;). The Polish cochineal (&quot;Porphyrophora polonica&quot;), a scale insect once used to produce red dye, lives on cinquefoils and other plants in Eurasia. Some, but not all, cinquefoils are insect-pollinated, producing nectar that lures bees, hoverflies, muscid flies, butterflies, true bugs, and ants.

==Fossil record==
One fossil fruitlet of †&quot;Potentilla pliocenica&quot; has been described from a middle Miocene stratum of the Fasterholt area near Silkeborg in Central Jutland, Denmark. Four fossil fruits of †&quot;Potentilla pliocenica&quot; have been extracted from bore hole samples of the Middle Miocene fresh water deposits in Nowy Sacz Basin, West Carpathians, Poland.

==Uses==

===Horticulture===
Some cinquefoils are grown as ornamental plants. These are generally high species with bright, showy flowers, such as golden cinquefoil (&quot;P. aurea&quot;), ruby cinquefoil (&quot;P. atrosanguinea&quot;), Nepal cinquefoil (&quot;P. nepalensis&quot;), and sulphur cinquefoil (&quot;P. recta&quot;). Horticultural hybrids such as Hopwood&#x27;s cinquefoil (&quot;Potentilla&quot; × &quot;hopwoodiana&quot;) and tongue cinquefoil (&quot;Potentilla&quot; × &quot;tonguei&quot;) have been bred, and there exists a range of cultivars. Some double-flowered cinquefoils have been bred, starting with Victor Lemoine&#x27;s &#x27;Gloire de Nancy&#x27; in 1854. Other taxa and varieties are useful for more specialized gardening purposes, such as rock gardens or swamps. Among the former is the hardy spring cinquefoil (&quot;P. neumanniana&quot;), the floral emblem of Cromartyshire.

===Health===
Some species are used in herbalism. Common tormentil (&quot;P. erecta&quot;), for example, has been used as an herbal remedy for inflammation and gastrointestinal disorders. Research continues to determine its safety and usefulness as an alternative medicine for such disorders as ulcerative colitis. &quot;Potentilla discolor&quot; and &quot;P. multifida&quot; are Chinese medicinal herbs used to treat diabetes.

==Cultural references==
In heraldry, the cinquefoil emblem or &quot;potentilla&quot; signified strength, power, honor, and loyalty. Depiction of the five-petalled flower appears as early as 1033, in the architecture of the church built in the village of Reulle-Vergy in Burgundy, France, two years before the reign of William the Conqueror. The cinquefoil emblem was used generously in the architecture of numerous churches built in Normandy and Brittany through the 15th century.

From the 11th to 14th century, the word &quot;potence&quot;, related to &quot;potentilla&quot;, was used mainly in a military context and to describe the condition of the soul. 

At the time of William the Conqueror, the potentilla was used as the device of Bardolph of Brittany, who was the master of William&#x27;s military engineer corps.

<doc id="254389" wikidata="Q153911" url="?curid=254389" title="Louis Antoine de Bougainville">
<text>Louis-Antoine, Comte de Bougainville (12 November 1729 – 31 August 1811) was a French military officer and explorer. A contemporary of the British explorer James Cook, he served in the Seven Years&#x27; War and the American Revolutionary War. Bougainville later gained fame for his expeditions, including a circumnavigation of the globe in a scientific expedition in 1763, the first recorded settlement on the Falkland Islands, and voyages into the Pacific Ocean. Bougainville Island of Papua New Guinea as well as the flowering plant &quot;Bougainvillea&quot; are named in his honour.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Bougainville was born in Paris, the capital of the Kingdom of France, the son of notary Pierre-Yves de Bougainville (1688–1756), on 12 November 1729. In early life, he studied law, but soon abandoned the profession.

In 1753, he entered the French Army in the corps of Musketeers of the Guard. At the age of twenty-five he published a treatise on integral calculus, as a supplement to Guillaume de l&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s treatise, &quot;Des infiniment petits&quot;.

In 1755, he was sent to England as secretary to the French embassy in London, where he was made a member of the Royal Society.

===Seven Years&#x27; War (French and Indian War)===
In 1756, Bougainville was stationed in Canada as captain of dragoons and aide-de-camp to the Marquis de Montcalm. He took an active part in the capture of Fort Oswego in 1756 and the 1757 Battle of Fort William Henry. He was wounded in 1758 at the successful defense of Fort Carillon. He sailed back to France the following winter, under orders from the marquis to obtain additional military resources for the colony. During this crossing, he continued to learn about the ways of the sea, skills that would later serve him well. Having distinguished himself in the war against Britain, Bougainville was rewarded with the Cross of St Louis and promoted to colonel. When he returned to Canada the following year, he had gained few supplies. The metropolitan officials had decided that, &quot;When the house is on fire, one does not worry about the stables&quot;.

During the pivotal year of 1759 (see Seven Years&#x27; War and French and Indian War), Bougainville participated in the defence of fortified Quebec, the capital of New France. With a small elite troop under his command, among which were the &quot;Grenadiers&quot; and the &quot;Volontaires à cheval&quot;, he patrolled the north shore of the St. Lawrence River, upstream from the city; he prevented the British several times from landing and cutting communications with Montreal. He did not have sufficient time, however, to rally his troops and attack the British rear when they successfully ascended the Plains of Abraham and attacked Quebec on 13 September.

Following the death of the Marquis de Montcalm and the fall of Québec on 18 September 1759 – after the colonel&#x27;s aborted attempt to resupply the besieged city – Bougainville was dispatched to the western front by his new commanding officer, the Chevalier de Lévis. He attempted to stop the three-pronged attack against Montréal from his entrenchments at Île-aux-Noix. He was among the officers who accompanied Lévis to Saint Helen&#x27;s Island off Montreal for the last French stand in North America before the general capitulation of September 1760. Of the war, Bougainville wrote in his journal: &quot;It is an abominable kind of war. The very air we breathe is contagious of insensibility and hardness&quot;.

Shipped back to Europe along with the other French officers, all deprived of military honors by the victors, Bougainville was prohibited by the terms of surrender from any further active duty against the British. He spent the remaining years of the Seven Years&#x27; War (1761 to 1763) as a diplomat, helping to negotiate the Treaty of Paris. Under this France ceded most of New France east of the Mississippi River to Great Britain.

===First French circumnavigation===

====Îles Malouines settlement====
After the peace, the French decided to colonise the &quot;Îles Malouines&quot; (Falkland Islands). These islands were at that time almost unknown. At his own expense, Bougainville undertook the task of resettling Acadians who had been deported to France by the British because of their refusal to sign loyalty oaths.

On 15 September 1763, Bougainville set out from France with the frigate &quot;L&#x27;Aigle&quot; (Eagle) (captained by Nicolas Pierre Duclos-Guyot) and the sloop &quot;Le Sphinz&quot; (Sphinx) (captained by François Chenard de la Giraudais). This expedition included the naturalist and writer Antoine-Joseph Pernety (known as Dom Pernety), the priest and chronicler accompanying the expedition, together with the engineer and geographer Lhuillier de la Serre.

The expedition arrived in late January 1764 in French Bay (later renamed Berkeley Sound). They landed at Port Louis named after King Louis XV. A formal ceremony of possession of the Islands was held on 5 April 1764, after which Bougainville and Pernety returned to France. Louis XV formally ratified possession on 12 September 1764.

Although the French colony did not number more than 150 people, for financial motivations (Bougainville having paid for the expeditions) and diplomatic reasons (Spain feared that the Falklands would become a rear base to attack her Peruvian gold), Bougainville was ordered by the French government to dismantle his colony and sell it to the Spanish. Bougainville received 200,000 francs in Paris and an additional 500,000 francs in Buenos Aires. Spain agreed to maintain the colony in Port Louis, thus preventing Britain from claiming title to the islands. Spain had claimed dominion before the French settlement in association with its colonies on the mainland. On 31 January 1767 at Río de la Plata, Bougainville met Don Felipe Ruiz Puente, commanding the frigate &quot;La Esmeralda &quot;and &quot;La Liebre&quot; (&quot;the Hare&quot;) and future governor of Islas Malvinas, to transfer possession and evacuate the French population.

Bougainville wrote: 

It was not before 1766, that the English sent a colony to settle in Port de la Croisade, which they had named Port Egmont; and captain Macbride, of the Jason frigate, came to our settlement the same year, in the beginning of December. He pretended that these parts belonged to his Britannic majesty, threatened to land by force, if he should be any longer refused that liberty, visited the governor, and sailed away again the same day.

====Circumnavigation====
In 1766, Bougainville received from Louis XV permission to circumnavigate the globe. He would become the 14th navigator, and the first Frenchman, to sail around the world (though some are led to believe that Richard of Normandie, who was part of the fleet of Ferdinand Magellan during his circumnavigation, was the first Frenchman to do so). Completion of his mission bolstered the prestige of France following its defeats during the Seven Years&#x27; War. This was the first expedition to circumnavigate the globe with professional naturalists and geographers aboard.

Bougainville left Nantes on 15 November 1766 with two ships: &quot;Boudeuse&quot; (captain : Nicolas Pierre Duclos-Guyot) and the &quot;Étoile&quot; (commanded by François Chenard de la Giraudais). This was a large expedition, with a crew of 214 aboard &quot;Boudeuse&quot; and 116 aboard &quot;Étoile&quot;. Included in the party was the botanist Philibert Commerçon (who named the flower &quot;Bougainvillea&quot;) and his valet. Commerson&#x27;s valet was later revealed to be a woman Jeanne Barret (also Baré or Baret); she would become the first woman known to circumnavigate the globe. Other notable people on this expedition were the astronomer Pierre-Antoine Veron; the surgeon of &quot;Boudeuse&quot; Dr. Louis-Claude Laporte; the surgeon of the &quot;Étoile&quot; Dr. François Vives; the engineer and cartographer aboard the Étoile Charles Routier de Romainville; and the writer and historian Louis-Antoine Starot de Saint-Germain.

====Tahiti====
He saw islands of the Tuamotu group on the following 22 March, on 2 April saw the peak of Mehetia and visited the island of Otaheite shortly after. He narrowly missed becoming their discoverer; a previous visit and claim had been made by British explorer Samuel Wallis in HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot; less than a year previously. Bougainville claimed the island for France and named it &quot;New Cythera&quot;. During this part of his expedition, one of his crew members, Jeanne Barret, was discovered to be a woman and confessed.

His expedition left Tahiti and sailed westward to southern Samoa and the New Hebrides, then on sighting Espiritu Santo turned west still looking for the &quot;Southern Continent&quot;. On 4 June he almost ran into heavy breakers and had to change course to the north and east. He had almost found the Great Barrier Reef. He sailed through what is now known as the Solomon Islands but, because of the hostility of the people there, avoided landing. He named Bougainville Island for himself. The expedition was attacked by people from New Ireland so the French expedition made for the Moluccas. At Batavia, they received news of Wallis and Carteret who had preceded Bougainville in discovering Tahiti.

====Return to France====
On 16 March 1769, the expedition completed its circumnavigation and arrived at Saint-Malo. It had lost only seven of its 340 crew, an extremely low level of casualties. This result was considered a credit to the enlightened management of the expedition by Bougainville.

Bougainville brought to France a Tahitian named Ahutoru who volunteered to come with him. In France, Bougainville introduced Ahutoru to the high society, including introducing him to the King and Queen at Versailles. Bougainville also underwrote part of the costs for Ahutoru&#x27;s return to Tahiti after a two-year absence. The voyage took place under Marion Dufresne, but Ahutoru died en route of smallpox in October 1771.

====&quot;Voyage autour du monde&quot;====
In 1771, Bougainville published his travel log from the expedition under the title &quot;Le voyage autour du monde, par la frégate &quot;La Boudeuse&quot;, et la flûte &quot;L&#x27;Étoile (a.k.a. &quot;Voyage autour du monde&quot; and &quot;A Voyage Around the World&quot;). The book describes the geography, biology and anthropology of Argentina (then a Spanish colony), Patagonia, Tahiti, and Indonesia (then a Dutch colony). The book was a sensation, especially the description of Tahitian society. Bougainville described it as an earthly paradise where men and women lived in blissful innocence, far from the corruption of civilization.

Bougainville&#x27;s descriptions powerfully expressed the concept of the noble savage, influencing the utopian thoughts of philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau before the advent of the French Revolution. Denis Diderot&#x27;s book &quot;Supplément au voyage de Bougainville&quot; retells the story of Bougainville&#x27;s landing on Tahiti, narrated by an anonymous reader to one of his friends. Diderot used his fictional approach, including a description of the Tahitians as noble savages, to criticize Western ways of living and thinking.

===American Revolutionary War===
After several years of absence, Bougainville again accepted a naval command. In 1777, he was captain of the 74-gun &quot;Bien-Aimé&quot;. He took part in the War of American Independence, playing a crucial part in the French victory at the Battle of the Chesapeake.

At the Battle of the Saintes, Bougainville commanded the 80-gun &quot;Auguste&quot;. He managed to rally eight ships of his own division, and bringing them safely into Saint Eustace after the defeat of Comte de Grasse. He was promoted to &quot;chef d&#x27;escadre&quot;. When he re-entered the French Army, he was commissioned as &quot;maréchal de camp&quot;.

After Peace of Paris in 1783, Bougainville returned to Paris. He obtained the place of associate of the Académie de Marine. He proposed a voyage of discovery to the North Pole, but did not gain the support of the French government.

===Promotion and retirement===
In 1787, he became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He obtained the rank of vice-admiral in 1791.

In 1794, having escaped from the Reign of Terror, he retired to his estate in Normandy. Returning to Paris, he was one of the founding members of the Bureau des Longitudes. In 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte, at the time serving as First Consul of the Republic, made him a senator. He died in Paris on 31 August 1811, during Napoleon&#x27;s reign of the First French Empire.

The heart of Louis Antoine De Bougainville is buried at the Cimetière du Calvaire in Paris, the rest of his body is buried at the Panthéon, also in Paris.

==Legacy and honors==
* Bougainville&#x27;s name is given to the largest eastern island of Papua New Guinea; and to the strait which divides it from the island of Choiseul.

In the Falklands, Port Louis, and &quot;Isla Bougainville&quot; (Lively Island&#x27;s Spanish name) commemorate him.
* The genus of South American climbing shrubs with colorful bracts, &quot;Bougainvillea&quot;, is named after him.

<text>The National Arts Centre Orchestra (NAC Orchestra) is a Canadian orchestra based in Ottawa, Ontario led by music director Alexander Shelley. The NAC Orchestra&#x27;s primary concert venue is Southam Hall at the National Arts Centre. Since its inception, the Orchestra has commissioned more than 90 works, mostly from Canadian composers. The NAC Orchestra has made over 50 commercially released recordings. The Orchestra has visited more than 125 cities in Canada and more than 130 cities internationally in its 51-year history, including a coast-to-coast Canadian tour in 1999 and again in 2017. In May 2019, the NAC Orchestra completed a major European tour, performing and delivering education events in five countries.

==History==
The NAC Orchestra was founded in 1969 as the resident orchestra of the newly opened National Arts Centre, with Jean-Marie Beaudet as music director and Mario Bernardi as founding conductor. Bernardi became music director in 1971 and held the post until 1982. The NAC Orchestra undertook first international tour in 1973 to Europe, travelling as far as Leningrad. The NAC Orchestra has remained committed to touring internationally, averaging approximately one tour per every two years. Previous tours have taken them to the UK, Japan, China, the United-States of America, and all over Europe.

Beaudet and Bernardi are the only Canadian conductors to be appointed music director of the NAC Orchestra. Bernardi was named Conductor Laureate in 1997. Subsequent NAC Orchestra music directors have included Franco Mannino (1982 to 1987), Gabriel Chmura (1987 to 1990), and Trevor Pinnock (1991-1997). From 1999 to 2015, Pinchas Zukerman was the NAC Orchestra&#x27;s music director. The orchestra expanded to 61 players during Zukerman&#x27;s tenure. In October 2013, the NAC Orchestra announced the appointment of Alexander Shelley as its next music director, as of the 2015–2016 season, with an initial contract of 4 years.

<doc id="254395" wikidata="Q1853054" url="?curid=254395" title="Alforsite">
<text>Alforsite is a barium phosphate chloride mineral with formula: Ba5(PO4)3Cl. It was discovered in 1981, and named to honor geologist John T. Alfors (1930–2005) of the California Geological Survey for his work in the area where it was discovered.

Alforsite is a hexagonal colorless crystal in the chemical class phosphates and the group apatite. It is found in certain parts of central California, primarily Fresno, Mariposa, and Tulare Counties. It has also been found in Baja California, Mexico.

Alforsite is a constituent of the apatite group of minerals. It crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system with a point group of 6/m and space group P63/m. It occurs as colorless grains that are hard to distinguish from fluoroapatite, as they both display low birefringence and high relief.

==Composition==
Alforsite&#x27;s ideal chemical formula is Ba5(PO3)4Cl. Chemical analysis of the composition of alfrosite was demonstrated by the use of an Ortex current digitizer and an electron microbe. Synthetic barium chlorapatite, strontianite, and fluorapatite were used as standards for the elements they contain. The chemical analysis revealed that traces of Mn, S, Si, and Pb were present and provided computational formulas of (Ba4.68Sr0.19Ca0.13)(P2.98Si0.01)O11.96(Cl0.99F0.05) and (Ba4.05Ca0.75Sr0.24Pb0.03)(P2.94Si0.01)O11.93(Cl0.93F0.14).

==Structure==
Alforsite exhibits Lau symmetry 6/m. It is concluded that the space group is P63/m because every single apatite compound possess that space group. The parameters of the unit cell are a=10.25 Å and c=7.64 Å. One barium atom in the unit cell is enclosed by nine oxygen atoms with a mean distance of 2.824 Å. Another barium atom is surrounded by six oxygen atoms with a mean distance of 2.791 Å and 3.230 Å, which creates two crystallographically distinctive barium atoms. The phosphate group in alforsite forms a regular tetrahedron.

==Geologic occurrence==
It is found crystallizing in the massive metasedimentary rock, sanbornite, which is found near granodiorite intrusions in Fresno and Mariposa counties, California. John T. Alfors’ colleagues named the mineral in his honor for his works with rare barium minerals of the sanbornite deposits. 
Alforsite was first discovered in samples from the Big Creek locality. Electron microprobe analysis of a thin-section of the sample from Big Creek revealed the new mineral, which resembled ordinary apatite. Rare barium minerals, mainly silicates, can be uncovered in sanbornite deposits of eastern Fresno and Mariposa counties, California. Alforsite is found in metamorphic sanbornite quartz, which occurs within a few hundred meters of granodiorite intrusions, and foliated quartzite. Gneissic banded rocks contain the mineral, which has been shown to be associated with witherite, sanbornite, and celsian in samples (with quartz-rich and gillespite-rich bands) from Incline. In order for the witherite- sanbornite-quartz to be stable, temperatures of 500 °C to 600 °C and pressures of 1–3 kbar are required.

==Special characteristics==
Synthetic alforsite has environmental importance because it may be used to replicate contamination by lead without the harmful effects of lead toxicity. For this reason, remediation of metal in soil can be practiced. Synthetic alforsite is prepared in a laboratory and mixed with soil to create a polluted soil, and then is treated with a mixture of salt and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and maintained at a pH level of nine for two weeks.

==Physical properties==
Alforsite occurs as colorless, minuscule subhedral grains with a diameter less than 0.05 mm. However, on rare occasions, it can crystallize to a diameter up to 0.2 mm. Minerals that belong to different groups, such as silicates, and sulfates exhibit the structural typology of apatite. This can pose problems and confusion because alforsite bears an almost exact resemblance to other barium silicates, which exemplifies its group Greek name, &quot;apatao,&quot; meaning, “I am misleading”. The only way to differentiate alforsite from other barium minerals is through microchemical analysis (Walstrom and Leising, 2005). This misleading mineral emulates the physical and structural features of apatite and is analogously similar to chlorapatite, providing alfrosite with the alternate name, barium chlorapatite. Alforsite has a low birefringence and a high relief resembling fluorapatite in thin-section. A reddish-violet cathodoluminescence appears on thin-section showing major levels of chlorine, phosphorus, and barium. 
Alforsite can be recognized by electron microprobe analysis or by intense violet fluorescence in the 10–15 kV electron beam of a luminoscope

==Origin of the name==
The mineral Alforsite was named for John T. Alfors in recognition of his extensive research of the type locality of barium minerals and other related rare and new minerals. John T. Alfors was a highly regarded geologist and mineralogist who worked for the state Division of Mines and Geology in California.

<doc id="254397" wikidata="Q221145" url="?curid=254397" title="Maria II of Portugal">
<text>Dona Maria II (4 April 1819 – 15 November 1853) &quot;the Educator&quot; () or &quot;the Good Mother&quot; (), was Queen of Portugal from 1826 to 1828, and again from 1834 to 1853. Her supporters considered her to be the rightful queen also during the period between her two reigns.

Maria was born in Rio de Janeiro during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King Dom João VI. She was the first child of the Duke and Duchess of Braganza, who later became Emperor Dom Pedro I and Empress Dona Maria Leopoldina of Brazil. In 1826, her father became king of Portugal but quickly abdicated in favour of the seven-year-old Maria. Both Pedro and Maria remained in Brazil, and her aunt Dona Isabel Maria initially served as regent for them in Portugal. Later Emperor Pedro&#x27;s brother Miguel replaced Isabel Maria as regent and was to marry Maria when she came of age. However, a few months after Miguel&#x27;s arrival in Portugal in early 1828 he deposed the absent Maria and declared himself king, thus beginning the Liberal Wars over royal succession. Maria remained outside Portugal throughout her first reign, finally arriving in Gibraltar just in time to learn of her deposition. She proceeded to England and then returned to Brazil. In 1831 her father (having abdicated the Brazilian throne) returned to Europe with his daughter and led a military expedition in support of Maria&#x27;s claim while she pursued her education in France. She finally set foot in Portugal for the first time in 1833 after Lisbon was occupied by forces supporting her. In 1834, Miguel was forced to abdicate and Maria was restored as undisputed queen. She remained a member of the Brazilian imperial family until 1835 when she was excluded from the Brazilian line of succession by law.

Maria&#x27;s second reign was marked by continued political turmoil. In January 1835, she married Auguste, Duke of Leuchtenberg, who died two months after their marriage. In April 1836, Maria remarried to Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Kohary. Maria&#x27;s second husband was proclaimed King Dom Fernando II a year later in accordance with Portuguese law following the birth of their first child, Pedro. Maria faced a series of difficult pregnancies and ultimately died in childbirth in 1853, at the age of 34. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Dom Pedro V.

== Early life ==
===Birth===
Maria II was born &quot;Maria da Glória Joana Carlota Leopoldina da Cruz Francisca Xavier de Paula Isidora Micaela Gabriela Rafaela Gonzaga&quot; on 4 April 1819 in the Palace of São Cristóvão in Rio de Janeiro, Kingdom of Brazil. She was the eldest daughter of Prince Dom Pedro de Alcântara, future King of Portugal as Pedro IV and first Emperor of Brazil as Pedro I, and his first wife Dona Maria Leopoldina (née Archduchess Caroline Josepha Leopoldine of Austria), herself a daughter of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor. She was titled Princess of Beira upon her birth. Born in Brazil, Maria was the only European monarch to have been born outside of Europe, though she was still born in Portuguese territory.

=== Succession crisis ===
The death of Maria&#x27;s grandfather, King Dom João VI, in March 1826 sparked a succession crisis in Portugal. The king had a male heir, Dom Pedro, but Pedro had proclaimed the independence of Brazil in 1822 with himself as Emperor. The late king also had a younger son, Infante Dom Miguel, but he was exiled to Austria after leading a number of rebellions against his father and his liberal regime.

Before his death, the king had nominated his favourite daughter, Dona Isabel Maria, to serve as regent until &quot;the legitimate heir returned to the kingdom&quot; — but he had failed to specify which of his sons was the legitimate heir: the liberal Emperor Dom Pedro I in Brazil or the absolutist, exiled Miguel in Austria.

Most people considered Pedro to be the legitimate heir, but Brazil did not want him to unite the Portuguese and Brazilian thrones again. Aware that his brother&#x27;s supporters were ready to bring Miguel back and put him on the throne, Pedro decided for a more consensual option: he would renounce his claim to the Portuguese throne in favor of his eldest daughter Maria (who was only seven years old), and that she was to marry her uncle Miguel, who would accept the liberal constitution and act as a regent until his niece reached the age of majority.

During her first reign, Maria remained in Brazil with her father, and her aunt Isabel Maria continued to serve as regent until Miguel agreed to his brother&#x27;s plan and returned to replace her in that role in early 1828. Miguel pretended to accept the agreement, but a few months after his arrival in Portugal he deposed Maria and proclaimed himself king, abrogating the liberal constitution in the process. Maria had finally sailed from Brazil a few days earlier, escorted by the Marquis of Barbacena. She was expected to land in Genoa and proceed from there to her grandfather&#x27;s court in Vienna.

=== Refuge in England and return to Brazil ===

Maria&#x27;s first reign was interrupted by the coup d&#x27;état led by her uncle, fiancé and regent Miguel, who was proclaimed King of Portugal on 11 July 1828, thus beginning the Liberal Wars that lasted until 1834, the year in which Maria was restored to the throne and Miguel exiled to Germany.

The Marquis of Barbacena, arriving in Gibraltar with the Queen on 3 September 1828, was informed by an emissary of what was happening in Portugal. He had the foresight to understand that Miguel had come from Vienna determined to put himself at the head of the absolutist movement, advised by Prince Klemens von Metternich, who was directing European politics, and so it was dangerous for the young Queen to go to Vienna. Taking responsibility, he changed the direction of the journey, and departed for London, where he arrived on 7 October. English policy was not conducive to its purpose. The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s office openly sponsored Miguel, so the asylum the Marquis had sought was not safe. Maria II was received in court with the honors due to her high rank, but the British prevented the Portuguese emigres to go to reinforce the garrison of Terceira Island.

Miguel&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état had not gone unopposed. On 16 May 1828, the garrison of Porto revolted, and in Lagos an infantry battalion did likewise. The revolts were stifled. Saldanha, Palmela, and others, who had come to take charge of the movement in Porto, re-embarked on the ship &quot;Belfast&quot;, which had brought them; the Porto garrison, reinforced by the academic volunteers of Coimbra and other liberal troops, emigrated to Galiza and from there to England. In January 1829, at the head of a small liberal expedition, the Marquis of Saldanha attempted to disembark in Terceira, Azores, but was not allowed to do it by the British frigate &quot;Ranger&quot;, whose vigilance could not avoid, however, that on 22 June 1829 the Count of Vila Flor, later Duke of Terceira, was able to disembark. In time, because in August 1829 appeared in front of the island a large Miguelist squadron that landed a body of disembarkation. A battle ensued on August 11th in the village of Praia, where the Miguelists were defeated. When the emigrants in England received the news of the victory, they felt great enthusiasm. They soon lost hope when they found out that the young Queen was returning to Brazil. In fact, Maria II&#x27;s situation in the English court, alongside the unfriendly attitude of the ministry in power, became embarrassing and humiliating. The Queen left London for Portsmouth to join the ship carrying her new stepmother, Amélie of Leuchtenberg from Ostend to Brazil. They left together on 30 August 1829 for Rio de Janeiro, arriving on 16 October.

The constitutional cause was thought to have been lost. The dispersed emigres (France, England and Brazil) were divided into rival factions. Only Terceira Island recognized the constitutional principles, and even there Miguelist guerillas appeared. France was ready to recognize Miguel&#x27;s government when the revolution of July broke out in Paris in 1830, which encouraged the Portuguese liberals.

=== Civil war ===
On 7 April 1831, Dom Pedro I abdicated the imperial crown of Brazil on behalf of his son Dom Pedro II, Maria&#x27;s younger brother, and came to Europe with his second wife and (sailing in a separate ship, and arriving later) his daughter, to support Maria&#x27;s rights to the crown of Portugal and join the forces loyal to her in the Azores in their war against Miguel. He took the title of Duke of Braganza, and of Regent in her name.

Almost at the same time, the regency of Terceira Island, named by Pedro and composed of the Marquis of Palmela, the Count of Vila Flor and José António Guerreiro, prepared an expedition that soon took possession of the Azores. While extending the constitutional territory, Pedro disembarked in France, being welcomed with sympathy by the new government and by Louis Philippe I. Miguel&#x27;s government had defied the immunities of French subjects and had not at once satisfied the complaints of the French government, which had sent a squadron commanded by Admiral Roussin to force the bar of Lisbon and impose humiliating conditions of peace.

Pedro left his daughter in Paris to finish her education, delivered to her stepmother, Empress Amélie, with good masters, and left for the Azores at the head of an expedition organized on Belle Isle, bringing his supporters together. Arriving in the Azores on 3 March 1832, he formed a new ministry, assembled a small army, whose command he gave to the Count of Vila Flor, and giving command of the fleet to Admiral Sartorius, departed for mainland Portugal, disembarking on 8 July at Memória Beach in Matosinhos. It was followed by the Siege of Porto and a series of battles until, on 24 July 1833, the Duke of Terceira entered victorious in Lisbon, having won the Battle of Cova da Piedade the day before. Porto and Lisbon, the main cities, were in the power of the liberals. 

Maria and her stepmother crossed from France to England, were received by King William IV and Queen Adelaide at Windsor, and then left for Portugal on a British naval ship, finally arriving in Lisbon for the first time in September 1833. Pedro pursued the war, eventually forcing his brother, Miguel to abdicate in 1834. Maria was thereupon restored as undisputed queen, and obtained an annulment of her betrothal. Soon after her restoration to the throne and her declaration of majority (so that no further regents would be necessary, although she was still only 15), her father died from tuberculosis.

On 7 February 1833, in order to protect the Queen, the 2nd Lancers Regiment was created, first known as the &quot;Regimento de Lanceiros da Rainha&quot; (Queen&#x27;s Lancers Regiment), with the motto &quot;Morte ou Glória&quot;, &quot;Death or Glory&quot; (the same as the 17th Lancers, since Lt. Col. Sir Anthony Bacon was its first commander), a fortunate coincidence since the queen&#x27;s name was Maria da Glória.

Occupying the Portuguese throne, Maria II was still heir presumptive to her brother Pedro II as Princess Imperial of Brazil, until her exclusion from the Brazilian line of succession by law no. 91 of 30 October 1835.

== Consolidation ==
=== Reign ===

Maria married Auguste, Duke of Leuchtenberg, son of Eugène de Beauharnais and grandson of Empress Josephine of France, on 26 January 1835, at the age of fifteen. However, he died only two months later, on 28 March 1835.

On 9 April 1836, Maria married the cultured Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In accordance with Portuguese law, he was proclaimed King Dom Fernando II upon the birth of their first child and heir, Pedro.

In 1842, Pope Gregory XVI presented Maria with a Golden Rose.

Maria&#x27;s reign saw a revolutionary insurrection on 16 May 1846, but this was crushed by royalist troops on 22 February 1847, and Portugal otherwise avoided the European Revolution of 1848. Maria&#x27;s reign was also notable for a public health act aimed at curbing the spread of cholera throughout the country. She also pursued policies aimed at raising the levels of education throughout the country.

===Death===
From her first pregnancy at the age of eighteen, Maria II faced problems in giving birth, with prolonged and extremely difficult labor. An example of this was her third pregnancy, whose labor lasted 32 hours, after which a girl was baptized &quot;&quot; with the name of Maria (1840).

At 25 years of age and in her fifth pregnancy, Maria II became obese and her births became even more complicated. In 1847, the fetal distress that preceded the birth of her eighth child – Infante Augusto, Duke of Coimbra – brought to the world a child &quot;quite purple and with little breathing&quot;.

The dangerous routine of successive pregnancies, coupled with obesity (which eventually caused her heart problems) and the frequency of dystocic births (worrisome, especially as a multiparous woman) led doctors to warn the queen about the serious risks she would face in future pregnancies. Indifferent to the warnings, Maria II merely replied: &quot;If I die, I die at my post.&quot;
On 15 November 1853, thirteen hours after the onset of labor of the stillborn Infante Eugénio, her eleventh child, Maria II died at the age of 34. The announcement of death was published in the Government Gazette of 16 November 1853:

In a letter dated 28 November 1853, the Duchess of Ficalho, the queen&#x27;s lady-in-waiting, reported the outcome to her brother, the 2nd Count of Lavradio:

Queen Maria II is remembered as a good mother and a kind person who always acted according to her convictions in her attempt to help her country. She was later given the nickname &quot;The Good Mother&quot;.

==Marriages and issue==
Maria first married Auguste Charles, 2nd Duke of Leuchtenberg, son of Eugène de Beauharnais, grandson of Empress Josephine, who died soon after arriving in Portugal.

She then married Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, son of Prince Ferdinand Georg August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and his wife Princess Maria Antonia Koháry de Csábrág.

<text>Bougainville Island (Tok Pisin: &quot;Bogenvil&quot;) is the main island of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, which is part of Papua New Guinea. Its land area is . The highest point is Mount Balbi, on the main island, at .

The much smaller Buka Island, , lies to the north, across the wide Buka Strait. Even though the strait is narrow, there is no bridge across it, but there is a regular ferry service between the key settlements on either side. The main airstrip in the north is in the town of Buka. Buka has an outcropping that is from New Ireland. Among the large islands of Papua New Guinea, New Ireland is the closest to Buka.

Bougainville is the largest island in the Solomon Islands archipelago. It was previously the main landmass in the North Solomons, which were associated with the German Empire. Most of the islands in this archipelago (which are primarily concentrated in the southern and eastern portions of it) are part of the politically independent Solomon Islands. Two of these islands—the closely connected Shortland Islands—are less than south or southeast of Bougainville, and about west of Choiseul, one of the settlements of which, Poroporo, faces Bougainville.

In a 2019 referendum, the citizens of Bougainville voted to become independent from Papua New Guinea by 2027, but the referendum was non-binding on the Papua New Guinea government, which has not committed to this.

==History==
=== Early history ===
During the Last Ice Age, present-day Bougainville Island was part of a single landmass known as &quot;Greater Bougainville&quot;, which spanned from the northern tip of Buka Island to the Nggela Islands. The earliest evidence of human settlement is at  Kilu Cave on Buka Island, where the earliest remains are from 26,700 to 18,100 BC. The first settlers were Melanesian people, likely related to modern Papuans and Indigenous Australians. In the 2nd millennium BC, Austronesian people arrived, bringing with them domesticated pigs, chickens, dogs, and obsidian tools. The first European contact with Bougainville was in 1768, when the French explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville arrived and named the main island after himself.

British and American whaling ships visited the island for provisions, water, and wood in the 19th century. The first on record was the &quot;Roscoe&quot; in 1822, and the last was &quot;Palmetto&quot; in 1881. Later, the German Empire laid claim to Bougainville in 1899, annexing it into German New Guinea. Christian missionaries arrived on the island in 1902. During World War I, Australia occupied German New Guinea, including Bougainville. It became part of the Australian Territory of New Guinea under a League of Nations mandate in 1920.

In 1942, during World War II, Japan invaded the island, but Allied forces launched the Bougainville campaign to regain control of the island in 1943. Despite heavy bombardments, the Japanese garrisons remained on the island until 1945. Following the war, the Territory of New Guinea, including Bougainville, returned to Australian control. On 18 April 1943, in Bougainville Island, during the Pacific War, the Japanese admiral, commander-in-chief of Combined Fleet Isoroku Yamamoto, died after his plane was attacked by US fighter planes and crashed into the jungle.

=== Attempts at independence ===
In 1949, the Territory of New Guinea, including Bougainville, merged with the Australian Territory of Papua, forming the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, a United Nations Trust Territory under Australian administration. On 9 September 1975, the Parliament of Australia passed the Papua New Guinea Independence Act 1975. On 11 September 1975, Bougainville declared itself the Republic of the North Solomons. Though it was later absorbed politically into Papua New Guinea.

Between 1988 and 1998, the Bougainville Civil War claimed over 15,000 lives. Peace talks brokered by New Zealand began in 1997 and led to autonomy. A multinational Peace Monitoring Group (PMG) under Australian leadership was deployed. In 2001, a peace agreement was signed, including the promise of a referendum on independence from Papua New Guinea. This referendum was held between 23 November and 7 December 2019, with results being declared on 11 December. The referendum question was a choice between greater autonomy within Papua New Guinea or full independence. Of the valid votes, 98.31% were in favour of full independence. The vote is not binding; the Government of Papua New Guinea has the final say on the status of Bougainville.

==Geography==

Bougainville is the largest island in the Solomon Islands archipelago. It is part of the Solomon Islands rain forests ecoregion. Bougainville and the nearby island of Buka are a single landmass separated by a deep wide strait. The island has an area of , and there are several active, dormant or inactive volcanoes that can rise to . Bagana () in the north central part of Bougainville is conspicuously active, spewing out gas that is visible for many kilometres. In 2013, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake was detected on the Bougainville Island; its epicenter was located 57 kilometers (35.4 miles) south of Panguna, a town on Bougainville Island.

== Ecology ==
Bougainville Island is primarily forested. Copper mining on the island by a Rio Tinto-owned mining operation in Panguna was known for their environmental impacts due to heavy metals. More recently, deforestation in order to feed the growing population has affected the flow of many rivers on the island. The United Nations Environment Programme has offered to facilitate the cleanup of the Panguna mine and explore reopening it with more stringent environmental standards.

== Climate ==

Bougainville Island has a tropical rainforest climate (Af on Köppen classification). The driest month is February.

==Economy==
Bougainville has one of the world&#x27;s largest copper deposits, which has been under development since 1972. The Panguna mine is estimated to have one billion tonnes of copper ore and 12 million ounces of gold. It was later shut down in a revolution against the Australian-run mine.

== Demographics ==
=== Religion ===
The majority of people on Bougainville are Christian, an estimated 75-80% being Roman Catholic as of 2015, and a substantial minority belonging to the United Church of Papua New Guinea and the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

=== Languages ===
There are many indigenous languages in Bougainville Province, belonging to three language families. The languages of the northern end of the island, and some scattered around the coast, belong to the Austronesian family. The languages of the north-central and southern lobes of Bougainville Island belong to the North and South Bougainville families.
The most widely spoken Austronesian language is Halia and its dialects, spoken on the island of Buka and the Selau peninsula of Northern Bougainville. The larger languages, such as Nasioi, Korokoro Motuna, Terei, and Halia, are split into dialects that are not always mutually understandable. For general communication, most Bougainvilleans use Tok Pisin as a lingua franca. English and Tok Pisin are the languages of official business and government.

Other Austronesian languages include Nehan, Petats, Solos, Saposa (Taiof), Hahon and Tinputz, all spoken in the northern quarter of Bougainville, Buka and surrounding islands. These languages are closely related. Bannoni and Torau are Austronesian languages not closely related to the former, which are spoken in the coastal areas of central and south Bougainville. On the nearby Takuu Atoll, a Polynesian language is spoken, Takuu. The Papuan languages are confined to the main island of Bougainville. These include Rotokas, a language with a very small inventory of phonemes, Eivo, Terei, Keriaka, Naasioi (Kieta), Nagovisi, Siwai (Motuna), Baitsi (sometimes considered a dialect of Siwai), Uisai and several others.

==Human rights==
Cut off from the outside world for several years by a Papua New Guinean blockade during the civil war, the islanders suffered many deaths from a lack of medical resources.

A 2013 United Nations survey of 843 men found that 62% (530 respondents) of those have raped a woman or girl at least once, with 26% (217 respondents) of the men reported having raped a non-partner, whereas 9% (74 respondents) reported having committed gang rape. Additionally, the survey also found that 8% (67 respondents) of the men had raped other men or boys.

==Popular culture==
&quot;The Coconut Revolution&quot;, a documentary about the struggle of the indigenous population to save their island from environmental destruction and gain independence, was made in 1999.

&quot;An Evergreen Island&quot; (2000), a film by Australian documentary filmmakers Amanda King and Fabio Cavadini of Frontyard Films, showed the ingenuity with which the Bougainvillean people survived for almost a decade (1989–1997) without trade or contact with the outside world because of the PNG military blockade.

&quot;Mr. Pip&quot; (2012) is a film by New Zealand director Andrew Adamson based on the book &quot;Mister Pip&quot; by New Zealand author Lloyd Jones. The film is set in Bougainville in the 1980s, during the civil war and blockades, and the cast is mostly Bougainvilleans.

<text>&quot;Dom&quot; Miguel I (; English: &quot;Michael I&quot;; 26 October 1802 – 14 November 1866), nicknamed &quot;the Absolutist&quot; (), &quot;the Traditionalist&quot; () and &quot;the Usurper&quot; (), was the King of Portugal between 1828 and 1834. He was the seventh child and third son of King John VI and Queen Carlota Joaquina.

Following his exile as a result of his actions in support of absolutism in the April Revolt (Abrilada) of 1824, Miguel returned to Portugal in 1828 as regent and fiancé of his niece Queen Maria II. As regent, he claimed the Portuguese throne in his own right, since according to the so-called Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom his older brother Pedro IV and therefore the latter&#x27;s daughter had lost their rights from the moment that Pedro had made war on Portugal and become the sovereign of a foreign state (Brazilian Empire). This led to a difficult political situation, during which many people were killed, imprisoned, persecuted or sent into exile, and which culminated in the Portuguese Liberal Wars between authoritarian absolutists and progressive constitutionalists. In the end Miguel was forced out from the throne and lived the last 32 years of his life in exile.

In order to counter the Republican opposition from the Portuguese Freemasons, the dynastic order known as Order of Saint Michael of the Wing was revived in 1848, with statutes issued by King Miguel I of Portugal.

==Early life==
Miguel Maria do Patrocinio de Bragança e Bourbon, the third (second surviving) son of King John VI and Carlota Joaquina, was born in the Queluz Royal Palace, Lisbon, and was created by his father Duke of Beja. Some sources have suggested that Miguel I could be the biological son from an adulterous affair between his mother, Queen Carlota, and one of her alleged lovers, possibly D. Pedro José Joaquim Vito de Meneses Coutinho, Marquis of Marialva. Apparently sources close to King John VI confirmed as much by asserting that he had not had sexual relations with his wife for two and a half years prior to Miguel&#x27;s birth (a period when his parents carried out a &quot;conjugal war&quot;, during which they were involved in permanent conspiracies, and only encountered each other in rare official circumstances).

But despite the gossip, Miguel was always considered to be a son of the king, by the king, by his mother, by the rest of the family, by the court, and by the church. The &quot;illegitimate child&quot; theories may have had their origins in the writings of pro-liberal propagandists or royalists who wanted to denigrate the queen and undermine the claims of Miguel and of his descendants to the Portuguese throne.

What is clear is that Miguel was the queen&#x27;s favourite child. After the death of her firstborn, it was Miguel who received most of her attention, rather than Pedro, who was closer to his father.

In 1807, at the age of 5, Miguel accompanied the Portuguese Royal Family on their transfer to Brazil in order to escape from the first Napoleonic invasion of Portugal; he returned in 1821 with John VI and his mother, while his brother Peter remained behind as regent of Brazil.

Miguel was a mischievous child, sometimes seen in the miniature uniform of a general. At sixteen he was seen galloping around Mata-Cavalos, knocking off the hats of passers-by with his riding crop. He spent most of his time with a rowdy band of half-caste or Indian farm-hands. In general, Miguel was spoiled by the queen and her royal household, and clearly influenced by the base tendencies of others. The Duke of Palmela described him as:

:&quot;A good man when among good men, and when among the bad, worse than they.&quot;

==Revolt==

Miguel was an avowed conservative and admirer of Prince Metternich, who had referred to the liberal revolutions in the 1820s as unrealistic and without any historical roots:

:&quot;A people who can neither read nor write, whose last word is the dagger – fine material for constitutional principles!...The English constitution is the work of centuries...There is no universal recipe for constitutions.&quot;

Miguel was 20 years old when he first challenged the liberal institutions established after the 1820 revolution, which may have been part of a wider strategy by the queen. He was at the head of the counter-revolution of 1823, known as the Vilafrancada, which erupted on 27 May 1823 in Vila Franca de Xira. Early in the day, Miguel joined the 23rd Infantry Regiment, commanded by Brigadier Ferreira Sampaio (later Viscount of Santa Mónica) in Vila Franca, where he declared his support for an absolutist monarchy. He immediately called on General Pampluna (later Marquis of Subserra) to join him and his cause. The general, not a fan of the liberal constitution, obeyed his summons and within five days he controlled the insurrectionary forces. The prince, supported by the queen, went so far as to demand the abdication of the king, who, faithful to his earlier oath, wanted to maintain the 1822 Constitution, despite the growing support for absolutist forces in Vila Franca.

Miguel and the queen were interested in overthrowing the parliamentary system and, inspired by the return of the absolutist monarchy in Spain (where the Holy Alliance and French Army had intervened to destroy the liberal forces there) they exploited factionalism and plotted with outside reactionaries to overthrow the liberal Cortes. But General Pampluna was loyal to the king, and made it perfectly clear that he would do nothing to defy the monarch, and advised the prince to obey his father&#x27;s summons. The king himself marched on Vila Franca where he received the submission of the troops and his son. But he also took advantage of the situation to abolish the 1822 Constitution and dismiss the Cortes. Many liberals went into exile. Although Miguel returned to Lisbon in triumph, the king was able to maintain complete control of power and did not succumb to the ultra-reactionary forces that supported his abdication.

After the events of the &quot;Vilafrancada&quot;, Miguel was made Count of Samora Correia and appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Army. But the queen could not tolerate the king&#x27;s continuing benevolence towards liberals and moderates, nor that he continued to be influenced by and to support ministers such as Palmela and Pamplona, who were more moderate in their outlook.

The mysterious death of the Marquis de Loulé in Salvaterra on 28 February 1824, in which it was suspected that Miguel or his friends were involved, was a symptom of the instability of the period. Prince Miguel was always influenced by his mother; and two months later, on 30 April 1824, as Commander-in-Chief of the Army he gathered his troops and ordered them to arrest ministers and other important people under pretext that a masonic conspiracy to assassinate the king existed, and placed his father in protective custody and incommunicado at Bemposta, where Miguel could &quot;defend and secure his life&quot;. The Abrilada, as this was to be known, worried many of the foreign powers. The foreign diplomatic corp (and in particular Marshal Beresford), realising that the king was a prisoner of his son, travelled to Bemposta and was able to ferry the king away and on board a British warship, the &quot;Windsor Castle&quot;. On board, the king summoned his son, whom he dismissed as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and immediately exiling him to Vienna, where he remained for over three years.

==Exile and return==

While in Vienna, he was a guest and friend of the Prince Metternich.
Meanwhile, on 10 March 1826, his father, King John VI, died and his brother Peter, the heir-apparent to the throne, became king as Peter IV. Peter, however, was committed to continuing as Emperor of Brazil and therefore abdicated the crown of Portugal after two months (on 2 May) in favour of his daughter, Maria II. Since the young sovereign was not yet of age, he instituted a regency, under his sister, Isabel Maria. Peter had already attempted to coerce Miguel to Brazil (1822) away from their mother without any success. Following the death of their father, Peter once again attempted to mend fences within the family and ensure Maria II&#x27;s right to the throne by offering Miguel the regency of Portugal (when he became 25) under a new liberal Constitutional Charter that would re-establish a constitutional monarchy. Under this arrangement, Queen Maria II and Miguel would be married when she came of age; until then Miguel would be her regent in Portugal. The new Constitutional Charter gave the crown moderating authority between the legislative, executive and judiciary, and introduced a 100-member Chamber of Peers (which included aristocrats and bishops and archbishops), a royal veto and indirect elections. Miguel accepted the proposal from his brother, swore to uphold the Constitutional Charter and, since the young Queen was only nine years old, waited until she would reach the age of marriage.

The regency under Isabel Maria was extremely unstable; discord reigned in the government, there were divisions within the municipal councils, rivalries between ministers and at one point, after the resignation of General Saldanha, a revolt in Lisbon. With Isabel Maria dangerously ill, Peter resolved to entrust his brother Miguel with the kingdom, which Miguel was only too eager to accept. A decree was promulgated on 3 July 1827 that granted Miguel his new role, and he departed from Vienna for Lisbon.

On the trip back to Lisbon he stopped in England, arriving on 30 December 1827. He was met by the Duke of Clarence, heir-presumptive to the British throne, and by other upper members of the English Court who had gathered at the dock to meet him. Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, then leading an unpopular Tory government, hoped that they could mold Miguel into accepting the constitutional framework that Peter IV had devised, and used this visit to facilitate the transition. After lunching at the Hospital Governor&#x27;s home, he travelled to London with his entourage in regal carriages and, escorted by cavalry officers, to the Palace of Westminster where he was met by a throng of people. While in London he stayed at the palace of Lord Dudley, on Arlington Street where he entertained his new friends; he was received by the ministers, ambassadors and municipal officials of King George IV, and was generally feted by English nobility, attending concerts and pheasant hunts, and visiting public works (such as the Thames Tunnel on 8 January 1828 which was then under construction and, ironically, collapsed a few days after his visit). On New Year&#x27;s Eve he visited the King at Windsor Castle and was honoured with a magnificent banquet. Later at Rutland House, Miguel received members of the Portuguese diaspora living in England, who presented him with a commemorative medallion. Throughout his visit he was generally well received.

==Regent==

On 13 January 1828 Miguel departed London; after spending some time at Stratfield Saye, the country home of the Duke of Wellington, he travelled to Plymouth en route to Lisbon. Due to bad weather, he was only able to transfer to the Portuguese frigate &quot;Pérola&quot; on 9 February, which arrived in England accompanied by two British ships. On 22 January the Gazeta de Lisboa (English: &quot;Lisbon Gazette&quot;) published an open letter from the &quot;Ministério da Justiça&quot; (English: &quot;Ministry of Justice&quot;) which permitted any general demonstrations of jubilation (unless otherwise prohibited by law). The prince&#x27;s ship arrived in Lisbon on 22 February and was met by cannon salvos from ships along the Tagus River and from the hilltops, beginning at two in the afternoon. The river was filled with ships when the &quot;Pérola&quot; arrived.

Although it was expected that the new regent would disembark at the Praça do Comércio, where a stage had been constructed, Miguel preferred to disembark in Belém. It is believed that Miguel&#x27;s mother had sent a boatman to pick up the prince and with a message to see her upon arriving in Lisbon, in order to tell her where his loyalties lay. On shore the local population acclaimed their regent with cheers, while bells rang from some church towers and cheerful hymns were sung in the streets. There was a triumphal march to the Ajuda Palace, along streets adorned with silk banners, while the ladies of the city threw flowers. Everywhere there was a multitude of citizenry yelling &quot;Viva o Senhor D. Miguel I nosso rei absoluto&quot; (&quot;&quot;), while some interjecting cries of &quot;death to D. Pedro&quot; and &quot;death to the liberal constitution&quot;.

But Miguel&#x27;s role was clearly delineated by his first night in Lisbon: he would govern as regent in the name of the rightful sovereign of Portugal, Queen Maria II. On her reaching marriageable age, Miguel would be her consort. Furthermore, Miguel was obliged to govern in conformity with Peter&#x27;s Constitutional Charter, something he accepted as a condition of the regency (even if he did not agree with its principles and favoured an absolute monarchy instead).

On 26 February, in the main hall of the Ajuda Palace in the presence of both Chambers of the Cortes, the Royal Court and the diplomatic corp, as well as some of the Prince&#x27;s colleagues from Brazil (carefully orchestrated by the Queen Dowager), the investiture began. At one o&#x27;clock Miguel, along with his sister, Isabel Maria, entered the chamber to formally hand over the Regency. After the spectacle of both of them in the same chair, the princess delivered the transitional oath and then left gracefully. Miguel was presented with the written oath to defend the Constitutional Charter along with a Bible, which caused him &quot;...confusion and [he] seemed unable or unwilling to read it.&quot; It is also unclear whether he actually swore the oath, since there was no distinct enunciation of the words; nor did any one actually see him kiss the missal (since the Duke of Cadaval obscured the prince during this part of the ceremony). Lord Carnarvon, in Lisbon at the time of the ceremony, wrote of the conclusion of the scene:
:&quot;During the whole proceeding...his countenance was overcast, and he had the constrained manner of a most unwilling actor in an embarrassing part. I read the approaching fate of the Constitution in his sullen expression, in the imperfect manner in which the oath was administered, and in the strange and general appearance of hurry and concealment.&quot;

On 1 March some citizens of Lisbon gathered at the palace to acclaim Miguel &quot;Absolute King&quot;, infuriating many of the liberal politicians and residents. Invested in his new title of regent, he presented his Ministers of State in the evening: Nuno III Álvares Pereira de Melo (Duke of Cadaval), José António de Oliveira Leite de Barros (later Count of Basto), Furtado do Rio de Mendonça (7th Viscount of Barbacena &amp; 2nd Count of Barbacena), José Luis de Sousa Botelho Mourão e Vasconcelos (Count of Vila Real) and the Count of Lousã. Within a week numerous moderate army officers had been dismissed and the military governors of the provinces replaced, as the Prince and Queen Dowager &quot;cleaned house&quot; of their old enemies and liberalist sympathisers.

==King of Portugal==

On 13 March 1828 Miguel dissolved the Cortes without calling new elections, as stipulated in the Constitutional Charter. Some municipal councils, many nobles and clergy, and several important citizens requested that the regent revoke the Constitutional Charter and reign as king. Blood was first spilled by the liberals, when delegates from the University of Coimbra (who ostensibly travelled to Lisbon to present their compliments to Miguel) were murdered on 18 March by hot-headed Coimbran students. On 25 April the senate (of the university), issued a proclamation in which they requested that Miguel assume the throne. This only fueled the divisions between liberals and absolutists. Because of the independence of Brazil, Miguel&#x27;s supporters considered Miguel to be the legitimate heir to the crown of Portugal. If, to liberals, the name of Miguel was despised, to the legitimists (the absolutists) it was venerated. But Miguel&#x27;s reign was immediately marked by cruel, almost tyrannical, governance which some attribute to him personally; however some blame the injustices on his subordinates, while others attribute them to the malevolence of Queen Charlotte.

On 3 May 1828, the very nobles who had been nominated by Peter to the new Chamber of Peers met in the Palace of the Duke of Lafões, and invited Miguel to convoke new Cortes consisting of the Three Estates with the purpose to decide the legitimate succession to the throne. The Cortes met in June at Ajuda, where the Bishop of Viseu proposed that Miguel should assume the crown since &quot;...the hand of the Almighty led Your Majesty from the banks of the Danube to the shore of the Tagus to save his people...&quot;. On 7 July Miguel was acclaimed as absolute ruler, and on 11 July the Three Estate Cortes closed.

Shortly afterwards the military garrison in Oporto revolted, formed a provisional governmental junta, and marched on Coimbra to defend the liberal cause. But the general in command of these troops was indecisive, and Miguel was able to raise his own troops, create a battalion of volunteers and blockade Oporto. In Lagos a similar revolt was attempted, but immediately quashed when the liberal General Saraiva was shot by the Miguelist General Póvoas. On this occasion, João Carlos Saldanha (later Duke of Saldanha) and Pedro de Sousa Holstein (later 1st Duke of Palmela), who had arrived from England on board the British ship &quot;Belfast&quot; in order to lead constitutional forces, quickly re-embarked, judging the liberal cause lost. The liberal army escaped to deplorable conditions in Galicia where they awaited the next move. In the former regency&#x27;s court there were few strong supporters of a constitutional monarchy; Princess Isabella Maria was supported by weak-willed ministers or incompetents and was personally too timid to stand up to Miguel. The liberals and their supporters escaped into exile. All of Portugal recognised the sovereignty of the monarch, except the islands of Madeira and Terceira; Madeira was easily subjugated, but Terceira remained faithful to the liberal cause.

The excess zeal of his supporters to prosecute the liberals would blacken the reputation of Miguel&#x27;s regime. During the liberal insurrection on 6 March 1829 in Cais do Sodré, Brigadier Moreira, his officers and their supporters were all bayoneted. On 7 May the members of the rebel garrison of Oporto who had revolted were also executed. In some cases, the local population contributed to these horrors and reprisals, as in Vila Franca da Xira where they assassinated 70 people believed to have liberal sympathies. Although these actions were disapproved of by many of Miguel&#x27;s ministers, the Count of Basto was not one of them. Even the Viscount of Queluz, a medic and intimate friend of the Miguel, was exiled to Alfeite for joining the chorus of those who challenged the reprisal killings. But the Queen Mother continued to support the attacks on liberals, and motivated these actions in order to strengthen the monarchy. Even after she died on 7 January 1830, many atrocities continued to be committed in the name of Miguel, some against foreign nationals who intervened in the politics of Portugal.

While Spain, the Holy See, and the United States recognised Miguel as king, in England and France there was little public support for the regime. The imprudence that the Miguelist government showed in harassing English and French foreign nationals provoked them to protest. Eventually Admiral Albin Roussin, was ordered by Louis Philippe I (who, like England, could not obtain any diplomatic satisfaction), to take action; he sailed up the Tagus, captured eight Portuguese ships and forcibly imposed a treaty (14 July 1831). But, Miguelist reprisals on liberals continued; most sentences were carried out within 24 hours. The 4th Infantry, in Lisbon, registered 29 executions on 22 and 23 August 1831 alone.

==Liberal Wars==

Only the island of Terceira in the Azores remained loyal to Queen Maria II; the constitutional government continued to function there in exile. At first João Carlos Saldanha was unable to reach the island, owing to the hostility of an English cruiser, but the Count of Vila Flor (later Duke of Terceira) was more successful; he arrived on the island, rebuilt the defences and quickly beat back Miguel&#x27;s forces (on 11 August 1829) as they were attempting to invade the island. By 1831 the liberals had taken over all the islands of the Azores.

Peter, after abdicating the imperial crown of Brazil, placed himself at the head of the Liberal Army (1831) and from the Azores launched an invasion of northern Portugal, Landing at Mindelo, near Oporto which he quickly occupied. But Miguel&#x27;s army was formidable, composed of the best troops, with dedicated volunteers and enthusiastic militiamen (although not, perhaps, the best senior officers). They easily encircled the city and lay siege to it. As the defence of Oporto persisted, Miguel resolved to visit his troops in April 1833. But in the meantime Lisbon fell into the hands of the Duke of Terceira, who had left Oporto earlier in the Liberal fleet commanded by Charles John Napier, disembarked in the Algarve and marched across the Alentejo to defeat the Miguelist General Teles Jordão (seizing the city on 24 July). Napier, after defeating a Miguelist fleet off Cape St. Vincent, joined the Duke of Terceira in the north, taking control of the Tagus.

Miguel was assisted by the French General Bourmont, who, after the fall of Charles X of France came with many of his legitimist officers to the aid of the king of Portugal (that is, Miguel). He was later replaced by the Scottish General Ranald MacDonnell who withdrew the Miguelist army besieging Lisbond to the almost impregnable heights of Santarém, where Miguel established his base of operations. The battles continued in earnest. In Alcácer the Miguelist forces captured some ground but this was quickly lost to General Saldanha in Pernes and Almoster. The latter action (18 February 1834) was the most violent and bloody of the civil war. In the end, politics sealed Miguel&#x27;s fate: his alliance with Carlos of Spain alienated the sympathies of Ferdinand VII of Spain, who recognised Maria&#x27;s claim to the Portuguese throne, and concluded a quadruple alliance with the queen and Peter as well as with the governments of France and England.

The Spanish General Rodil entered into Portugal while pursuing D. Carlos and his small force and at the same time the Duke of Terceira won the Battle of Asseiceira (16 May 1834) making D. Miguel&#x27;s position critical. Miguel escaped Santarém and moved south-east in the direction of Elvas. While Miguel made for Évora, his generals voted in a council of war to suspend hostilities and sue for peace. Miguel accepted the decision.

After a three-year civil war, Miguel I was forced to abdicate at the Concession of Evoramonte (26 May 1834). While Carlos was transported to England (he later secretly returned to Spain), Miguel embarked on 1 June 1834 on a British warship from Sines bound for Genoa; he lived in exile first in Italy, then in England, and finally in Germany. He never returned to Portugal.

==Second exile and death==

In December 1834 the Portuguese Cortes banished Miguel and all his descendants from Portugal upon pain of immediate death. The Constitution of 1838 (article 98) categorically excluded the collateral Miguelist line from the throne (although with the return to the Constitutional Charter in 1842, this ceased to have force). The 1834 banishment law remained in effect until repealed in May 1950. During his exile, he was known as Duke of Braganza, as well as Marquis of Vila Viçosa, Count of Arraiolos, Count of Barcelos, Count of Neiva and Count of Ourém.

On 15 January 1837 the Spanish Cortes, then in midst of the First Carlist War (1833–39), excluded Miguel from the Spanish succession, on the grounds that he was in rebellion along with his maternal uncle Carlos, the first Carlist pretender of Spain. Miguel&#x27;s eldest sister Teresa, Princess of Beira, and his nephews (the three sons of late Infanta Maria Francisca of Portugal, and Sebastian, son of Teresa, Princess of Beira) were also excluded.

Miguel lived the rest of his life in exile and, removed from Portuguese politics, his character altered radically; in his later years he was a portly heavily bearded patriarch and lacked the cowboy persona of his early life. He refused to accede to the terms of the Concession of Evoramonte and thereby forfeited his generous pension from the Portuguese government. He lived for a time as a destitute refugee in Rome, in apartments provided by Pope Gregory XVI, who also gave him a small monthly allowance. Following the death of Pope Gregory and the election of Pius IX as Pope, D. Miguel moved to London, arriving on 2 February 1847. In 1851, he moved to the Grand Duchy of Baden in southern Germany and married Princess Adelaide of Löwenstein. They settled in the former Cistercian monastery of Bronnbach, and raised seven children. His widow succeeded in securing advantageous marriages for all their daughters.

Miguel died while hunting at Bronnbach, Grand Duchy of Baden on 14 November 1866. He was buried in his wife&#x27;s family&#x27;s vault in the Franciscan monastery of Engelberg at Grossheubach, Bavaria. In 1967 his body and that of his wife (then resting in Ryde on the Isle of Wight in England) were transferred to the Braganza pantheon in the old Monastery of São Vicente de Fora in Lisbon.

<doc id="254406" wikidata="Q315316" url="?curid=254406" title="Jäger (infantry)">
<text> (; ; , ) is a German military term referring to specific light infantry units.

In German-speaking states during the early modern era, the term &quot;jäger&quot; came to denote light infantrymen whose civilian occupations (mostly hunters and foresters) made them well-suited to patrolling and skirmishing, on an individual and independent basis, rather than as part of a large-scale military unit or traditional line infantry. As a consequence, &quot;jäger&quot; was used to describe skirmishers, scouts, sharpshooters and runners. 

The word&#x27;s usage and derivatives broadened over time. For instance, was the name given by the Prussian Army to scouts and runners. Conversely, in the modern German army (), is the name given to military police.

 is usually translated into English as:
* &quot;rifleman&quot; (in an infantry role) or &quot;Rifles&quot; (in regimental names); and 
* &quot;ranger&quot; (especially in North American English; see below).

In English is often written as (both pl. and sgl., which is the alternative German spelling without umlaut) or anglicised as (pl. ) to avoid the umlaut completely, or rendered phonetically as &quot;yeager&quot;.

== Age of Enlightenment (18th century) ==
According to a popular theory, the earliest known &quot;jäger&quot; unit was a company formed in about 1631 in Hesse-Kassel, under William V, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. Wilhelm supposedly formed an elite light infantry unit for the Hessian Army, around a core drawn from his personal staff of gamekeepers (&quot;revierjäger&quot;; &quot;game preserve hunter&quot;), forest rangers and professional hunters.

It was not until the first half of the 18th century that the widespread recruitment began in various German states of gamekeepers, huntsmen and foresters employed on crown estates or those of noble landowners, for specialized units of riflemen and skirmishers.

By the early 19th century, because of their civilian occupations, &quot;jäger&quot; were usually familiar with the first true rifles, rather than the muskets used by regular infantry. While early long rifles took longer to load than the smoothbore musket of the line infantry, they had greater range and accuracy. The men were drawn from a &quot;well-esteemed class&quot;. The &quot;jäger&quot; became primarily used for reconnaissance, skirmishing or screening bodies of heavier troops.

Prussia, Hesse, Austrian Empire, the Russian Empire and many smaller states raised &quot;jäger&quot;-type small units during the Seven Years&#x27; War and thereafter. Initially these specialist units were formed for the duration of a particular campaign and thereafter disbanded. Russia maintained its &quot;jäger&quot; companies on a permanent basis for frontier service against the Ottoman Empire, and His Majesty&#x27;s Lifeguard Jäger Regiment continued in service until 1917.

The Prussian &quot;Jäger&quot; corps of Frederick the Great dated back to a mounted detachment raised in November 1740 and quickly expanded to two squadrons. Employed in wartime as guides and scouts, they eventually proved a useful frontier guard tasked with catching deserters and seizing contraband. After 1744, they were joined by an infantry branch of foot &quot;Jägers&quot;, initially divided into independent companies and then brought together as a full regiment by 1784. 
For fighting at close quarters the &quot;Jäger&quot; carried a straight-bladed hunting dagger (&quot;Hirschfänger&quot;), a short sabre or a falchion.

While the English term &quot;ranger&quot; is older, emerging during the 17th century to describe highly-mobile (&quot;ranging&quot;) foot and mounted infantry units in British North America, it became strongly associated with &quot;Jäger&quot; during the late 18th century, when German-speaking Hessian regiments served as part of the British Army in North America.

== Napoleonic era ==
Interest in light infantry tactics increased across Europe after the Battle of Valmy, where the Prussian line infantry proved unable to break through the French sharpshooters. Initially soldiers were drawn directly from the line infantry to fight as skirmishers instead, but in time many German-speaking states adopted &quot;Jäger&quot; to fulfill this role. In theory the &quot;Jäger&quot; operated in pairs to protect each other while reloading, and remained within 100–200 yards of close-order infantry on which they could fall back if they were endangered by cavalry or driven off by infantry. However, it was admitted that, due to the difficulty of controlling troops spread out in open-order and in the thick of battle, these guidelines might not always be followed. &quot;Jäger&quot; were allowed to act with a certain amount of initiative on the battlefield, unlike line infantry who were rigidly drilled and kept under tight control by their officers. For this reason, it was the most energetic and daring soldiers who were selected to become a &quot;Jäger&quot;.

The Prussians in particular developed their light infantry tactics both in theory and in practice during the early Napoleonic era. There was much disagreement over how much emphasis should be placed on &quot;Jägers&quot;, though, and reform was for the most part at the regimental level by more energetic commanders such as Yorck. It was not until the reorganization of the army led by Scharnhorst that the &quot;Jäger&quot; corps was strengthened on a national level. Having suffered crippling defeats at Jena and Lübeck, the Prussian army undertook major reforms, in many ways following the example of the French Revolutionary Army, becoming a nationalized force. 

Foreign mercenaries were removed, corporal punishment became rare (and was abolished for &quot;Jäger&quot; troops), and promotions were based on merit rather than nobility. New volunteers from a bourgeois background were organized to resist Napoleon&#x27;s invasion and occupation of Central Europe. Continuing the earlier traditions, in Prussia these &quot;Jäger&quot; were patriotic volunteers, bearing the cost of their weapons and uniforms at their own expense or with the help of contributions from friends and neighbours, and often organizing themselves into clubs and leagues. As one of the early adopters of skirmisher tactics, Yorck became inspector-general of the light infantry in Prussia and oversaw the increase and improvement of the new &quot;Jäger&quot; troops during the years of peace after the Treaty of Tilsit. The most famous of the Prussian &quot;Jäger&quot; were the volunteers of the Lützow Free Corps.

The Prussian army gained experience as an auxiliary force in the French invasion of Russia, where the &quot;Jäger&quot; were often used on the strategic level to provide support and cover for the rest of the army. They managed to escape the fate of Napoleon&#x27;s French soldiers after Yorck negotiated a battlefield truce with Russia when, during a rear-guard action, the French withdrew and left Yorck&#x27;s troops isolated. 

===German campaigns 1813 to 1815===

In the War of the Sixth Coalition that immediately followed, the &quot;Jäger&quot; of the various armies performed well against Napoleon&#x27;s forces, and Prussian &quot;Jäger&quot; played a significant role in the battles of the Waterloo campaign, holding off Grouchy&#x27;s corps at the Battle of Wavre.

The resistance against Napoleon exacted a high toll of military casualties, officers in particular. This in combination with a shift towards a meritocratic officer corps led to many promotions within the ranks. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars, many of the junior officers in the Germanic states&#x27; armies were former &quot;Jäger&quot; soldiers who had been promoted through the ranks.

== Prior to First World War ==
By the early twentieth century, &quot;Jäger&quot; units were part of the Imperial German, Austro-Hungarian, Swedish, Dutch and Norwegian armies. They corresponded to the rifles, light infantry, &quot;chasseurs à pied&quot; or &quot;bersaglieri&quot; units of the British, French, Italian and other armies. While such units still enjoyed considerable prestige and high &quot;esprit de corps&quot;, their training, equipment and tactical roles had for the most part become aligned with those of the line infantry of their respective armies.

===Jäger rank===
&quot;Jäger&quot; was in Austria and Germany until 1918 the lowest rank of the Jäger regiments, equivalent to private or soldier.

Other follows Gemeiner private ranks - &quot;Musketier&quot; (musketeer), &quot;Grenadier&quot;, &quot;Füsilier&quot; (fusilier), &quot;Infanterist&quot; (infantryman), &quot;Dragoner&quot; (en: dragoon), &quot;Husar&quot; (hussar), &quot;Ulan&quot; (uhlan), &quot;Kanonier&quot;, (gunner), &quot;Pionier&quot; (pioneer), &quot;Sanitäter&quot; (combat medic), &quot;Trainsoldat&quot; (trainman)

===Imperial Germany===
Best known were the German &quot;Jäger&quot; units who were distinguished by their peace-time wear of dark green tunics and shakos (in contrast to the dark blue tunics and spiked helmets of most German infantry).

In the peacetime Prussian Army, the main component of the Imperial German Army, there were one Imperial Guard Jäger battalion, the &quot;Garde-Jäger-Bataillon&quot;, and twelve &quot;Jäger&quot; battalions of the line. One &quot;Jäger&quot; battalion, the &quot;Großherzoglich Mecklenburgisches Jäger-Bataillon Nr. 14&quot;, was from the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Another, &quot;Westfälisches Jäger-Bataillon Nr. 7&quot;, known as the &quot;Bückeburg Jägers&quot;, was raised in the Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe, whose capital was Bückeburg. The other ten were from Prussian lands. Another Prussian Guard unit, the Guards Rifles Battalion, though not designated &quot;Jäger&quot;, was a &quot;Jäger&quot; formation. Its origins were in a French &quot;chasseur&quot; battalion of the Napoleonic era, and its troops wore the shako and green tunic of the &quot;Jäger&quot; battalions.

The army of the Kingdom of Saxony added two &quot;Jäger&quot; battalions, which were included in the Imperial German Army order of battle as &quot;Kgl. Sächsisches 1. Jäger-Bataillon Nr. 12&quot; and &quot;Kgl. Sächsisches 2. Jäger-Bataillon Nr. 13&quot;. The Saxon &quot;Jäger&quot; had a number of dress distinctions – notably tunics of a darker green than the Prussian colour, black facings instead of red and a black buffalo-hair plume buckled to the side of the shako. The autonomous Royal Bavarian Army provided a further two &quot;Jäger&quot; battalions, &quot;Kgl. Bayerisches 1. Jäger-Bataillon&quot; and &quot;Kgl. Bayerisches 2. Jäger-Bataillon&quot;, who wore the light blue of Bavarian infantry with green facings.

On mobilization in August 1914, each of these Prussian, Saxon and Bavarian &quot;Jäger&quot; battalions raised a reserve &quot;Jäger&quot; battalion. In September 1914, an additional twelve reserve &quot;Jäger&quot; battalions were raised, ten Prussian and two Saxon. In May 1915, the German Army began joining the &quot;Jäger&quot; battalions to form &quot;Jäger&quot; regiments, and in late 1917, the &quot;Deutsche Jäger-Division&quot; was formed.

During the early stages of World War I, the German &quot;Jäger&quot; maintained their traditional role as skirmishers and scouts, often in conjunction with cavalry units. With the advent of trench warfare, they were committed to an ordinary infantry role, integrated into divisions and lost their status as independent units. Cyclist &quot;Jäger&quot; served in the Balkan and Russian theatres of war, while Württemberg and Bavaria raised Ski-&quot;Jäger&quot; during the winter of 1914–15. Another specialist formation was the &quot;Jäger&quot; Storm Companies, serving as trench raiders during 1917–1918.

====Mounted &quot;Jäger&quot;====
In 1897, existing dispatch rider units within the Prussian Army were converted to &quot;Detachments Jäger&#x27; zu Pferde&quot;. Further mounted &quot;Jäger&quot; squadrons were subsequently raised, including short-lived Bavarian and Saxon detachments. After 1901, the original dispatch carrying role of the mounted &quot;Jäger&quot; was discontinued. Five newly raised squadrons were brought together to form a combined Mounted &quot;Jäger&quot; Regiment the same year. The experiment proved a successful one and between 1905 and 1913 a further 13 mounted &quot;Jäger&quot; regiments were created.

===Austria-Hungary===

The Austro-Hungarian Army in 1914 included four regiments of &quot;Tiroler Kaiserjäger&quot;, descended from a unit first raised in 1801. There were also 29 battalions of &quot;Feldjäger&quot; recruited from different regions across the Empire (including 7 Hungarian, 5 Bohemian and 4 Galician battalions) and one Bosnian-Herzegovinian &quot;Feldjäger&quot; Battalion (&quot;Bosnisch-hercegovinisches Feldjägerbataillon&quot;). All wore pike grey uniforms faced in green, with a form of bowler hat carrying a distinctive plume of dark green feathers. The exception was the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Feldjäger Battalion which wore the fez. Later, an additional three Feldjäger battalions and seven Bosnian-Herzegovinian Feldjäger Battalions were formed.

== Second World War Germany ==

After the First World War, the &quot;Jäger&quot; units of the Imperial German Army were disbanded, but their traditions were carried by infantry regiments of the 100,000-man Reichswehr of the Weimar Republic. After the Nazis came to power in 1933 and the rearmament of Germany began, the new Wehrmacht revived the name &quot;Jäger&quot; for various types of units:

* In 1935, the first specialized mountain infantry units were formed; their regiments and battalions were designated &quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot; (&quot;mountain infantry&quot; – &quot;Gebirge&quot; is German for &quot;mountain range&quot;). More specialized units, such as the &quot;Hochgebirgs-Jäger-Bataillone&quot;, for use in high-Alpine conditions, were also developed. The Waffen SS raised a &quot;Karstjäger&quot; Division.
* When the Luftwaffe began forming parachute units in the late-1930s, the first parachute regiment was designated &quot;Fallschirm-Jäger-Regiment 1&quot;. German paratroopers became known as &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; (&quot;Fallschirm&quot; is German for &quot;parachute&quot;). At first, &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; was applied only to genuine airborne-qualified troops, but the term was retained for &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; regiments and divisions even after they began operating as regular infantry. A number of &quot;Luftwaffen Feld-Divisionen&quot; (&quot;field divisions&quot;), regular ground combat units raised by the Luftwaffe, also used the term &quot;Luftwaffen-Jäger-Regiment&quot; for their infantry regiments. Many of these were later taken over by the army and retained the name &quot;Jäger-Regiment&quot;.
* Two &quot;Skijäger&quot; regiments were formed in 1943 as part of &quot;Skijäger-Brigade&quot; (later a &quot;Skijäger-Division&quot;).
* Certain infantry divisions were raised as &quot;light infantry divisions&quot; (&quot;leichte Infanterie-Divisionen&quot;) in late 1940. They were raised to operate in rough terrain, especially in southeastern Europe. Their infantry regiments were called &quot;Jäger-Regimenter&quot;, and in 1942 the light and light infantry divisions were renamed &quot;Jäger&quot; divisions.
* The antitank units of German divisions, originally called &quot;Panzer-Abwehr-Abteilungen&quot; (&quot;anti-tank battalions&quot;), began in 1940 to be redesignated as &quot;Panzerjäger-Abteilungen&quot;, (literally &quot;tank hunter battalions&quot;). These were equipped with towed or self-propelled guns (often the ad hoc mounting of an antitank gun on a captured or obsolete tank chassis). As the war progressed, some &quot;Panzerjäger-Abteilungen&quot; were fully equipped with specialized tank destroyers, initially known as &quot;Panzerjäger&quot; (tank hunters), and later by 1943 as &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; (&quot;hunting tank&quot;) with enclosed, armored casemate superstructures.
* The military police of the Wehrmacht was known as the &quot;Feldgendarmerie&quot;. In December 1943, a new force of military police, directly subordinated to the Armed Forces High Command, was formed. Its units were designated &quot;Feldjäger-Kommandos&quot; with subordinated &quot;Feldjäger&quot; battalions and regiments. These were known collectively as the &quot;Feldjägerkorps&quot;. The name was taken from the &quot;Reitendes Feldjägerkorps&quot;, a Prussian Army military police-type unit directly under the General Staff.
*The 24th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS was known as &quot;Karstjäger&quot; (&quot;Karst Riflemen&quot;).

== After Second World War ==

===Germany===
&quot;Jäger&quot; (short: Jg; English: hunter) is the lowest soldier rank of enlisted men of the modern day&#x27;s German Bundeswehr for soldiers belonging to the light infantry, paratroopers and mountain troops. It is grouped as OR1) in NATO, and might be comparable to Private (rank) in the United States Army as well as British Army, or to other Anglophone armed forces.

Reflecting military tradition, in German speaking armed forces there are a number of OR1-rank descriptions – including &quot;Jäger&quot; – used as the lowest rank of an individual soldier. These may vary according to the service branch (Heer, Luftwaffe, Bundeswehr, medical service etc.). Other examples are Grenadier for mechanized infantrymen and &quot;Kanonier&quot; for artillerymen.

The German &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; rejected the term &quot;Feldgendarmerie&quot; and instead kept the term &quot;Feldjäger&quot; for its military police units. To emphasize the traditional connection with the Prussian &quot;Reitendes Feldjägerkorps&quot;, rather than the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; military police units, the &quot;Feldjäger&quot; of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; wear a red beret with star badge (the &quot;Gardestern&quot;) of the Order of the Black Eagle, Prussia&#x27;s highest chivalric order. The &quot;Reitendes Feldjägerkorps&quot; had been granted the right to wear the &quot;Gardestern&quot; in 1847.

In addition, at certain periods, light infantry units of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; were designated as &quot;Jäger&quot;, and wore a green beret with a beret badge patterned after the &quot;Jäger&quot; sleeve patch of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; &quot;Jäger&quot; units. Each battalion of &quot;Jäger&quot;, &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; and &quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot;, has a &quot;heavy company&quot; of Wiesel weapon-carriers equipped with 20 mm cannon, TOW launchers or 120 mm mortars.

The modern &quot;Jäger&quot;-type infantry units are distinguished as follows:
* &quot;Jäger&quot; – light infantry specialized for assault and defense operations in urban and rugged terrain, often equivalent to mechanised infantry, but using APCs rather than Infantry Fighting Vehicles. Capabilities also include raiding patrols and &quot;Jagdkampf&quot;, a special operations tactic for platoon-sized deployments primarily behind FLET (Forward Line of Enemy Troops) and to hunt down smaller enemy detachments (e.g. SOF) behind the own lines. They can also be deployed in air-mobile/air-assault operations (heliborne). They wear a green beret with a golden badge displaying oak leaves surrounded by a braided chord.
* &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; – &quot;Airborne Rangers&quot; – paratroopers, light airborne infantry units. As above. They wear a Bordeaux beret with a badge displaying an attacking eagle.
* &quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot; – &quot;Mountain Rangers&quot; – light infantry for mountain terrain, rugged and urban terrain, with special equipment for winter warfare. Instead of a beret, they wear a grey &quot;Bergmütze&quot; mountain cap - a type of stiff forage cap – see (German)) with Edelweiss insignia.
* Soldiers in the Wachbataillon (Guard battalion at the Ministry of Defence) are called &quot;Grenadier&quot;.

With a former restructuring of the German Army, only one new air-mobile regiment, &quot;Jägerregiment&quot; 1 (JgRgt 1), two battalions, &quot;Jägerbataillon&quot; 291 (JgBtl 291) and &quot;Jägerbataillon&quot; 292 (JgBtl 292) (both battalions are part of the Franco-German Brigade) and two other new bataillons of the mechanised brigades are the only regular &quot;Jäger&quot; retained. On the other hand, &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; has become the most important infantry type, due to its versatility and the nature of modern-day peacekeeping missions abroad.

With the last restructuring of the German Army, Jägerregiment 1 was reduced to Jägerbataillon 1 (JgBtl 1), not air-mobile any longer. Two new battalions were established: Jägerbataillon 91 and Jägerbataillon 413.

===Austria===
In the Austrian &quot;Bundesheer&quot;, ″&quot;Jäger&quot;″ is the official military technical term for infantry units (contrary to mechanized infantry being designated as &quot;Panzergrenadiers&quot; similar to corresponding German &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; and Swiss Armed Forces units). In addition, the Austrian Army&#x27;s Special Forces unit which was established in 1963 is called ″&quot;Jagdkommando&quot;″.

===Denmark===
In August 1788, the Hessian Johann Ewald was hired to form a jagercorp in Sleswig. He had seen plenty of combat in North America as the commander of both mounted jägers and jägers on foot.
From then on until the late 1850s the Danish army had a number of jagercorps, battalion-sized light infantry units mainly armed with rifles.

Under the army law of 1842 a total of five out of 23 battalions of infantry were jägers. By 1860 all five had been converted to ordinary infantry as the 18th-22nd Battalions, since all infantry were now armed with rifles and were trained to fight in heavy skirmish lines as the main way of fighting. This change ended a specific jäger tradition in the Danish army.

In the modern day Danish army, &quot;Jæger&quot; is used for the special forces unit &quot;Jægerkorpset&quot; (Jaeger Corps). In 2019, the 13th Light Infantry Battalion was created at the Haderslev garrison as the only regular light infantry unit in the army as part of the reborn Slesviske Fodregiment.

===Lithuania===
In present-day Lithuania the Vytautas the Great Jäger Battalion (&quot;Lithianian: Vytauto Didžiojo jėgerių batalionas&quot;) forms part of the Lithuanian Special Operations Force.

===Finland===
====Jäger as rank====

&quot;Jääkäri&quot; / &quot;jägare&quot; (Finnish / Swedish word for &quot;jäger&quot;) is the lowest rank (private) in peacetime infantry formations (in wartime Finnish Army all jägers serve in the operative forces while &#x27;regular&#x27; infantry typically consisting of older reservists is split between regional and local forces) of the Finnish Army and in the marines of the Nyland Brigade (part of the Finnish Navy). In the Finnish Border Guards, the private rank is called &quot;rajajääkäri&quot; (&quot;border jäger&quot;).

The rank pays homage to the role of the World War I era &quot;Jäger&quot; Movement in securing Finnish Independence.

Besides riflemen, specialists such as drivers, medics, military police and mortar squad members in the above-mentioned infantry formations usually hold the rank of &quot;jäger&quot;. The rank-and-file mortar crew members in regional and local forces hold the rank of Private as mortar crews are seen as part of infantry rather than artillery. They use the green background of infantry/jägers on their unit insignia while the forward observers directing their fire, though viewed as part of infantry, use the red of artillery. In units other than infantry, equivalent ranks such as &quot;tykkimies&quot; (&quot;gunner&quot;) or &quot;viestimies&quot; (&quot;signalist&quot;) are used (see Finnish military ranks). In all other Navy units except the Uusimaa Brigade, the private rank is &quot;matruusi&quot; (&quot;sailor&quot;).

The old infantry rank of &quot;sotamies&quot; (&quot;private&quot;, lit. &quot;soldier&quot;) is no longer used in peacetime training units, but remains reserved for war-time regular infantry usage as opposed to &quot;jääkäri&quot; used by light and/or specialized infantry.

====Jäger as troop type indicator====

The word &quot;jäger&quot; is also used to indicate a) in general the best trained and equipped combat arms troops of the Defence Forces and b) specifically for the following troops.

&quot;Finnish Army&quot;
* Jääkärijoukot (&quot;Jäger Troops&quot;) – refers to any 1st line infantry units with top-of-the-line equipment
* Panssarijääkärit (&quot;Armoured or Panzer Jägers&quot;) — mechanized infantry of the Armoured Brigade
* Kaartinjääkärit (&quot;Guards Jägers&quot;) — infantry of the Guard Jaeger Regiment, specializing in urban warfare
* Laskuvarjojääkärit (&quot;Parachute Jägers&quot;) — rangers / paratroopers of the Utti Jäger Regt (conscripts)
* Erikoisjääkärit (&quot;Special Jägers&quot;) — the Army&#x27;s Special Forces, part of the Utti Jäger Regt (career military)

&quot;Finnish Navy&quot;
* Rannikkojääkärit (&quot;Coastal Jägers&quot;) — marines of the Uusimaa Brigade

&quot;Border Guards&quot;
* Rajajääkärit (&quot;Border Jägers&quot;) — rangers / light infantry of the Border Guard
* Erikoisrajajääkärit (&quot;Special Border Jägers&quot;) — special operations capable forces within the Border Guard

In addition to the above, some non-infantry units (such as &quot;Jääkäritykistörykmentti&quot; (JTR), &quot;Jäger Artillery Regiment&quot;, formerly &quot;Jääkäripatteristo&quot; (JPsto), &quot;Jäger Artillery Battalion&quot; &amp; the defunct &quot;Hämeen Ratsujääkäripataljoona&quot; (HämRjP), &quot;Häme Mounted Jäger Battalion&quot;-) use the word &quot;jäger&quot; in their name to show direct lineage to the original Jäger Movement.

===Norway===
&quot;Jeger&quot; is the general term indicating highly trained soldiers and operators capable of conducting military ISTAR (intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, reconnaissance) operations independently behind enemy lines. There are several units using the &quot;jeger&quot; term, both conventional forces and special operation forces.

====SOF units====
Within the Norwegian Armed Forces there are two special operations forces with the jeger name. The commando name refers to the Norwegian specialised forces from World War 2 like Norwegian Independent Company 1.

* Marinejegerkommandoen (Naval Special Operations Commando) – the SOF operators are referred to as &quot;Marinejeger&quot; (Navy Ranger) or &quot;Spesialbåtoperatør&quot; (Special Boat Operator) and is highly trained in naval SOF and ISTAR operations.
* Forsvarets Spesialkommando (Special Operations Commando) – this unit&#x27;s operators are referred to as &quot;Spesialjeger&quot; (Special Ranger) – SOF operators trained highly for airborne SOF and ISTAR.

====Specialised jeger units====
In the Norwegian Armed Forces, there are several jeger units of troop and company size, who fill the criteria as special operations, but are not designated as such by the Norwegian military. These units are a mix composed of professional soldiers and conscripts. The units also consists of JTAC operators.

* Kystjegerkommandoen (Coastal Ranger Command) – operators are referred to as &quot;Kystjeger&quot; (Coastal Ranger) and are highly trained in conducting direct action, raids, ship-boarding and naval ISTAR operations along the Norwegian shore lines.
* Fjernoppklaring (Long-Range Recon) – the operators are referred to as &quot;Feltoperatør&quot; (Field Operator) and bears exactly the same status as a &quot;jeger&quot;. This unit is highly trained in conducting ISTAR and special reconnaissance operations far behind enemy lines.
* Artillerijeger (Artillery Ranger) – the soldiers are highly trained to conduct ISTAR missions mainly to support the artillery battalion with information, locations and fire missions regarding high valued artillery targets. 
* Fallskjermjegertroppen (paratrooper platoon) - The Armed Forces Special Commands training wing has a platoon consisting of conscripts highly trained for raid and airborne ISTAR operations.
* Jegertroppen (Hunter troop) – The Armed Forces Special Commands training wing has a unit consisting of female conscripts only, highly trained for urban ISTAR operations.

====Conventional jeager units====
The armed forces includes ranger troops providing ISTAR for their own units.

* Garrison of Sør-Varanger (Border Rangers) – an infantry battalion consisting of conscripts trained as jaegers in order to maintain surveillance along the Norwegian/Russian border.
* Home Guard - ISTAR/ranger units in each regional district.
* The Royal Guards light armoured reconnaissance platoon.

===Sweden===
Swedish &quot;jägare&quot; are troops such as commandos or light infantry. The former now consist of:

* Parachute Airborne Rangers – &quot;fallskärmsjägare&quot; (lit. &quot;parachute rangers&quot;)
* Marine commandos of the Swedish Amphibious Corps – &quot;kustjägare&quot; (lit. &quot;coastal rangers&quot;)
* Rangers of the Army Ranger Battalion, airborne rangers of the Life Regiment Hussars (same regiment as &quot;Fallskärmsjägarna&quot;), the Swedish Air Force&#x27;s outer-perimeter patrols &quot;Flygbasjägarna&quot; (lit. &quot;airbase rangers&quot;) and the Military Police units for urban warfare from the Life Guards.

Historically, the first units to be named &quot;jägare&quot; were infantry and cavalry units stationed in the sparsely populated border province of Jämtland: Jämtlands hästjägarkår in 1834 and Jämtlands fältjägarkår from 1853.

After World War II, the Army Ranger School, later Lapplands jägarregemente, was formed in Kiruna. In the following years, the then cavalry regiments mainly developed into either ranger regiments (K 3 and K 4) or into tank regiments.

===Netherlands===
After the Napoleonic period, the Jager Battalions were incorporated into the line infantry and disappeared as such (except for the Colonial Jager units destined for the West Indies). Their role was taken over by the flank companies of each battalion, one of every four battalions in an &#x27;Afdeeling&#x27; or Regiment was designated a Flank Battalion (Light Infantry).

In 1829, a new Royal Guard was raised, which included a Grenadier Regiment and a Jager Battalion. These were immediately sent into action during the Belgian Secession (1830–1832). During that war, voluntary units like Van Dams&#x27; Jagers and several Voluntary Student Companies, were dressed and equipped as Jagers, including a mounted Jager detachment; after the war, these voluntary units were disbanded.

In 1995, after a long history as separate units, the Guard Grenadiers and Jagers were united into the Grenadiers&#x27; and Rifles Guard Regiment.

In 1950, several Infantry Regiments were disbanded; their traditions were transferred to a new regiment, which was located and closely tied to Limburg Province. Since it took over the traditions of the Jager Contingent of the German Confederation, which was provided by Limburg Province, the Regiment was called the Limburgse Jagers and adopted the French horn in their emblem. Currently the active troops of this infantry regiment are located in Oirschot, just outside their home province in North Brabant, but close ties to the province remain.

===Ukraine===
As of December 2022, the Ukrainian armed forces had three Jaeger brigades, each with around 2,000 servicemen, the 13th, 68th, and the 71st Jaeger Brigade.
They are likely forest-specialized infantry forces, with the 71st also doubles as airmobile infantry.

The first of the Jaeger Brigades, the 61st, which was activated in 2016 as motorized infantry under the 4th Reserve Corps, was transformed into a mechanized infantry brigade in 2022.

<doc id="254407" wikidata="Q3482356" url="?curid=254407" title="Shirley M. Tilghman">
<text>Shirley Marie Tilghman, (; née Caldwell; born 17 September 1946) is a Canadian scholar in molecular biology and an academic administrator. She is now a professor of molecular biology and public policy and president emerita of Princeton University. In 2002, &quot;Discover&quot; magazine recognized her as one of the 50 most important women in science.

Tilghman was the 19th president of Princeton University; she was the first woman to hold the position and the second female president in the Ivy League. Tilghman was also the first biologist to hold the Princeton presidency. She is the fifth foreign-born president of Princeton, and the second academic born in Canada to be elected to the position.

A leader in the field of molecular biology, Tilghman was a member of the Princeton faculty for fifteen years before being named president. She has returned to the Princeton faculty as a professor of molecular biology. In that capacity, she has returned to the Lewis-Sigler Institute of Integrative Genomics as a faculty member; while she is not currently engaged in research, Tilghman actively advises undergraduates in their independent research, including the senior thesis for seniors.

Tilghman also continues to hold leadership positions in the global scientific community. She was the 2015 president of the American Society for Cell Biology.

==Early life and family==
Tilghman was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. As a young child, her father encouraged her interest in math. She graduated from Kelvin High School in Winnipeg, Manitoba and received her honours B.Sc. in chemistry from Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario, in 1968. She was a secondary school teacher in Sierra Leone, West Africa, in the Canadian University Services Overseas (CUSO) Program. 
Tilghman earned her Ph.D. in biochemistry from Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, under Richard W. Hanson. Tilghman was Hanson&#x27;s first graduate student. Her PhD Dissertation was entitled &quot;The Hormonal Regulation of Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase.&quot; 

==Personal life==
She married Joseph Tilghman in 1970. This marriage ended in 1983, leaving Shirley Tilghman with custody of their young daughter (Rebecca) and infant son (Alex). She attributes her successful balancing of a scientific career and caring for her family to organization and focus. Her goal was to not feel guilty while at work or at home, instead focusing on the task at hand.

==Research==
Tilghman&#x27;s work in molecular genetics focused on the regulation of genes during development, particularly in the field of genomic imprinting.

During postdoctoral studies at the National Institutes of Health, Tilghman made a number of discoveries while a member of the team which cloned the first mammalian gene. She went on to demonstrate that the globin gene was spliced, a finding that helped confirm some of the revolutionary theories then emerging about gene behavior. As an independent investigator at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia from 1980 to 1986 and adjunct associate professor of Human Genetics at the University of Pennsylvania Tilghman continued to make scientific breakthroughs.

Tilghman went to Princeton University in 1986 as the Howard A. Prior Professor of the Life Sciences. Two years later, she also joined the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as an investigator. She was a leader in the use of mice to understand the behavior of genes by researching the effect of gene insertion in embryonic cells.

In 1998, she took on additional responsibilities as the founding director of Princeton&#x27;s multi-disciplinary Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, while continuing to study how male and female genomes are packaged and the consequences of the differences for regulating embryo growth. 

Tilghman&#x27;s extensive series of published research papers are catalogued on the PubMed government website of the United States National Library of Medicine, the NLM division of the National Institutes of Health.

==President of Princeton University==

Tilghman succeeded Harold Tafler Shapiro and became the 19th president of Princeton University in 2001. She was elected Princeton&#x27;s first woman president on May 5, 2001, and assumed office on June 15, 2001. Under her administration, the university built a sixth residential college, named in honor of alumna Meg Whitman, to accommodate an 11 percent expansion of the undergraduate student body (an increase of some 500 students), as recommended by a special committee of the Board of Trustees chaired by Paul M. Wythes. In 2012, Tilghman announced that she would step down from her presidency in June 2013. She was succeeded by the university&#x27;s then-provost, Christopher L. Eisgruber.

For Tilghman, Princeton has two essential missions. &quot;One is to ensure that our doors are open as wide as possible to every talented student in the world who is capable of doing the hard work we ask of them. And that means maintaining our commitment to financial aid, which is the tool – the critical tool – to get those students to Princeton. And the second thing is that we must address the most critical issues, and push back the frontiers of knowledge, and not just in science and technology, but in social policy, and in public policy, and in understanding the nature of the human condition.&quot;

The establishment of Whitman College, together with the reconstruction of Butler College, accompanied a significant reconfiguration of Princeton&#x27;s residential college system, which now incorporates upperclassmen as well as freshmen and sophomores, providing new residential options and increasing opportunities for social interaction across the student body. In addition, an effort has been made to strengthen the relationship between the university and Princeton&#x27;s independent eating clubs, where most upperclassmen take their meals, with the goal of enhancing the undergraduate experience of all students. In 2009, she appointed a committee chaired by Nannerl O. Keohane to review undergraduate women&#x27;s leadership at Princeton.

===Academics===
Tilghman has presided over a number of academic initiatives at Princeton, including the creation of a Center for African American Studies, the Lewis Center for the Arts (named after alumnus Peter B. Lewis), the Princeton Neuroscience Institute and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment (after alumnus Gerhard R. Andlinger). Along with the renewal of the Department of Chemistry, these steps have both capitalized on Princeton&#x27;s existing strengths and broken new ground, ensuring that the university will, in Tilghman&#x27;s words, continue &quot;to make the world a better place through the power of the mind and the imagination.&quot; 

===Diversity===
More broadly, Tilghman&#x27;s presidency has placed an emphasis on increasing the diversity of Princeton&#x27;s faculty and students; widening access to the university through improvements to its generous financial aid program and the elimination of admission through &quot;early decision&quot;; fostering a multidisciplinary approach to teaching and research; and strengthening the university&#x27;s international perspective through a wide range of initiatives – from the Global Scholars Program, which brings international scholars to campus on a recurring basis, to the Bridge Year Program, which gives incoming freshmen an opportunity to defer their studies for a year in order to devote themselves to public service overseas.

===Funding higher education===
====Student loans====
As her presidency started the university accomplished the long-hoped-for goal of eliminating the need for student loans; Princeton became the first American university to replace student loans with grants from its endowment. In principle, students earning a Princeton degree could graduate debt free.

====Tuition====
The size of the endowment and the success of these programs prompted some to question whether Tilghman would implement a policy of eliminating tuition altogether. In her &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article on this matter, she indicated that Princeton would continue to charge tuition, and that she felt that charging tuition was a morally and economically correct policy to maintain.

====Fundraising====
During her tenure the percentage of students receiving some form of financial aid increased and the size of the average award also increased. These policies were partially facilitated by the growing size of the university&#x27;s financial endowment, whose income is used to finance the university&#x27;s mission alongside tuition, and the annual funding of the operating budget through alumni donations from Princeton&#x27;s Annual Giving campaign.

===Controversies===
====Pro-women hirings====
Although President Tilghman has been accused of favoring women in her hiring practices, in fact, most of her appointees have been men.

The women she has hired to senior positions include Amy Gutmann as provost, the second-most-powerful administrative position in the university, Anne-Marie Slaughter as Dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs fka Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs as well as her successor Christina Paxson, Maria Klawe as Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and Janet Lavin Rapelye as the Dean of Admission. Gutman would go on to lead the University of Pennsylvania as their president in early 2004; Klawe was chosen president of Harvey Mudd College in 2006. Slaughter took a leave from the university to serve as Director of Policy and Planning at the U.S. State Department, reporting to the Secretary of State at the time, Hillary Clinton. Paxson became president of Brown University in 2012.

Tilghman has appointed prominent men to leadership positions at Princeton, such as Charles Kalmbach as the senior vice president for administration, the highest non-academic administrative post, David P. Dobkin as dean of the faculty, Gutmann&#x27;s replacement as provost and Tilghman&#x27;s successor Christopher L. Eisgruber, and Klawe&#x27;s replacement Vincent Poor.

She initiated a review of undergraduate women&#x27;s leadership at Princeton, chaired by Nannerl O. Keohane; the review found that the early prominence for women in leadership positions that accompanied to introduction of women students to the campus had recently not been as frequently repeated.

====Ivy League seven-week athletic moratorium====
Tilghman signed on to the Ivy League-wide seven-week athletic moratorium, since modified, in which intercollegiate athletes were enjoined from taking part in supervised practices and other obligatory athletic activities for seven weeks during the academic year in order to encourage them to participate in other activities. Supporters of the proposal pointed to studies by former Princeton president William G. Bowen, whose controversial book &quot;The Game of Life&quot; purported to describe widespread academic &quot;underperformance&quot; of college athletes. Detractors claimed that the book was flawed, and the moratorium represented an encroachment on students&#x27; freedom to use their time as they saw fit.

====University donor complaint====
During her presidency, Tilghman was embroiled in a court case pitting her against the family of a major donor to the university, the Robertsons. The children of the original donors, who were themselves Princeton alums, alleged that the university failed to apply the funds donated by their parents to the intended purpose, and asked for the funds to be restored to the family for use elsewhere. The donated funds had become joined with the university&#x27;s general endowment, resulting in efficiencies and benefits in fund management and performance, which were not the subject of the Robertsons&#x27; complaints. The case was settled in 2008 with a payment to the family of $40 million in legal fees and another $50 million, plus interest, to a new foundation to support education for government service. Princeton retained the remainder of the money for the Wilson school.

====Corporate board matters====
In August 2012, Tilghman was subpoenaed in her dual capacities as Princeton&#x27;s president and as a member of Google&#x27;s board, as part of a suit to block a board approved 2-for-1 Google stock split that the complaining party claimed would represent &quot;an unfair effort to diminish its voting power while reserving voting rights for the company’s founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin&quot;. All members of the Google board received subpoenas. In the case of Tilghman, &quot;records of donations, contribution pledges or promises made by Tilghman or the university to any charities, organizations, foundations or educational institutions that have any affiliation with Page, Brin, Schmidt or Google&quot; were demanded.

===Precedents===
While Tilghman disquieted some alumni by championing affirmative action policies, establishing a single admission process, and broadening the range of residential and dining options available to students, she also found strong support for these actions and their underpinning vision. Tilghman presided over a major effort to advance the growing community of Princeton Alumnae, culminating in a campus conference entitled &quot;She Roars&quot;. In her final year, Tilghman led the first major university celebration for &quot;alternative genders&quot;, resulting in an immensely successful on-campus LGBT alumni gathering; this was the first of its kind on any campus in the United States and set a precedent for the advancement of the LGBT community nationwide.

===Internal roles===
As president of Princeton University, Tilghman was also an ex-officio trustee of the Princeton Board of Trustees, and chairman of Princeton Honorary Degrees Committee.

Tilghman orchestrated an orderly transition from her other Princeton roles after being named president. David Botstein succeeded Tilghman as the Director of the Lewis-Sigler Institute of Integrative Genomics in 2003. Ned S Wingreen succeeded her as the Howard A Prior Professor of Life Sciences. She eventually closed her lab to dedicate her time fully to the presidency; in doing so, she assured that all students who had begun with her as adviser were able to successfully complete their degrees and associated research before the lab closed.

An award-winning teacher, Tilghman continued to conduct classes even while serving as president.

She became a &quot;Princeton Parent&quot; when her daughter matriculated at Princeton as an undergraduate during her tenure as president and was accorded honorary alumna status to a record number of Princeton classes.

===External roles===
While serving as president of Princeton, Tilghman accepted membership on the board of directors of Google, and served in that capacity from October 2005 to February 2018. As compensation for joining the board, she received 6,000 shares of stock that by 2005 were worth in excess of her Princeton compensation package that by 2003 had reached $533,057.

Beginning in 2001, she served for a time on the Queen University&#x27;s Chemistry Innovation Council in order to help the development of the Chemistry program at Queen&#x27;s, which is based in Kingston, Ontario, Canada.

Tilghman served on the board of trustees at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), Long Island, New York, during the early years of her presidency.

In 2006, Tilghman was one of three sitting university presidents who served on the Duke University President&#x27;s Council that investigated the university&#x27;s wide-ranging actions after the lacrosse players scandal wherein members of the Duke lacrosse team were charged with various types of inappropriate and allegedly illegal off campus behavior.

===Successor===
On September 21, 2012, Shirley informed the Princeton Board of Trustees that she planned to step down as the 19th president of Princeton University at the end of the 2012 academic year. On April 21, 2013, it was announced that Christopher L. Eisgruber would succeed Tilghman as Princeton&#x27;s president, effective July 1. Notable Princeton alumnus Peter Lewis 1955 said at the time, &quot;Ideally, she&#x27;d be remembered for grooming a terrific successor.&quot;

==Roles after Princeton presidency==
Tilghman continues as a member of the Princeton faculty in the Department of Molecular Biology and is a faculty member of the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics.

Upon leaving the Princeton presidency, Tilghman retained her seat on the Google board. At the time, Google&#x27;s Eric Schmidt supported this retention by emphasizing the benefits Google had received from Tilghman generally in her service on the Board.

Tilghman continues to serve as a Trustee of Amherst College. She is a member of the board of the Brookhaven Science Associates, the organization that manages Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, New York.

She is a Trustee of the Institute for Advanced Study. Tilghman serves on the board of the Broad Institute, founded to encourage a unique model of collaborative, inter-institutional research, initially through joint efforts between Harvard and MIT. She is a Trustee of LEDA, the Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America.

In 2013, Tilghman was elected to serve as the 2015 president of the ASCB. 

==Quotes==
&quot;What made it truly thrilling was that the genes were organized in a way that was totally unexpected. So nature took us by surprise.&quot;

&quot;There are 25 years of good social science that demonstrate the many cultural practices that act collectively to discourage women from entering and continuing careers in science and engineering. The research is overwhelming, and it is there for anybody to see. On the other hand, the data that would suggest there are innate differences in the abilities of men and women to succeed in the natural sciences are nonexistent.&quot;

On how she hoped to spend her time during her sabbatical before returning to the faculty in 2014, Tilghman said, 
&quot;I’m going to be an attentive grandmother.&quot; (In &quot;The Daily Princetonian&quot; article &quot;Princeton’s biggest fan, Princeton’s biggest critic&quot; by Luc Cohen, May 30, 2013.)

On explaining the thinking that led her to found a backup day-care option for Princeton employees introduced in 2007, an idea that reflected her own career management while raising two children, Tilghman said, &quot;For years, I had said that when I retired, I would start a company that hired retired people to sit for working mothers...&quot;

<doc id="254408" wikidata="Q634155" url="?curid=254408" title="Lexical functional grammar">
<text>Lexical functional grammar (LFG) is a constraint-based grammar framework in theoretical linguistics. It posits two separate levels of syntactic structure, a phrase structure grammar representation of word order and constituency, and a representation of grammatical functions such as subject and object, similar to dependency grammar. The development of the theory was initiated by Joan Bresnan and Ronald Kaplan in the 1970s, in reaction to the theory of transformational grammar which was current in the late 1970s. It mainly focuses on syntax, including its relation with morphology and semantics. There has been little LFG work on phonology (although ideas from optimality theory have recently been popular in LFG research).

==Overview==
LFG views language as being made up of multiple dimensions of structure. Each of these dimensions is represented as a distinct structure with its own rules, concepts, and form. The primary structures that have figured in LFG research are:
* the representation of grammatical functions (f-structure). See feature structure.
* the structure of syntactic constituents (c-structure). See phrase structure rules, ID/LP grammar.

For example, in the sentence &quot;The old woman eats the falafel&quot;, the c-structure analysis is that this is a sentence which is made up of two pieces, a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP). The VP is itself made up of two pieces, a verb (V) and another NP. The NPs are also analyzed into their parts. Finally, the bottom of the structure is composed of the words out of which the sentence is constructed. The f-structure analysis, on the other hand, treats the sentence as being composed of attributes, which include features such as number and tense or functional units such as subject, predicate, or object.

There are other structures which are hypothesized in LFG work:
* argument structure (a-structure), a level which represents the number of arguments for a predicate and some aspects of the lexical semantics of these arguments. See theta-role.
* semantic structure (s-structure), a level which represents the meaning of phrases and sentences. See Glue Semantics.
* information structure (i-structure)
* morphological structure (m-structure)
* phonological structure (p-structure)

The various structures can be said to be mutually constraining.

The LFG conception of linguistic structure differs from Chomskyan theories, which have always involved separate levels of constituent structure representation mapped onto each other sequentially, via transformations. The LFG approach has had particular success with nonconfigurational languages, languages in which the relation between structure and function is less direct than it is in languages like English; for this reason LFG&#x27;s adherents consider it a more plausible universal model of language.

Another feature of LFG is that grammatical-function changing operations like passivization are relations between word forms rather than sentences. This means that the active-passive relation, for example, is a relation between two types of verb rather than two trees. Active and passive verbs involve alternative mapping of the participants to grammatical functions.

Through the positing of productive processes in the lexicon and the separation of structure and function, LFG is able to account for syntactic patterns without the use of transformations defined over syntactic structure. For example, in a sentence like &quot;What did you see?&quot;, where &quot;what&quot; is understood as the object of &quot;see&quot;, transformational grammar puts &quot;what&quot; after &quot;see&quot; (the usual position for objects) in &quot;deep structure&quot;, and then moves it. LFG analyzes &quot;what&quot; as having two functions: question-focus and object. It occupies the position associated in English with the question-focus function, and the constraints of the language allow it to take on the object function as well.

A central goal in LFG research is to create a model of grammar with a depth which appeals to linguists while at the same time being efficiently parsable and having the rigidity of formalism which computational linguists require. Because of this, computational parsers have been developed and LFG has also been used as the theoretical basis of various machine translation tools, such as AppTek&#x27;s TranSphere, and the Julietta Research Group&#x27;s Lekta.

<doc id="254410" wikidata="Q156175" url="?curid=254410" title="Luís I of Portugal">
<text>&quot;Dom&quot; Luís I (; ; 31 October 1838 – 19 October 1889), known as the Popular (Portuguese: &quot;o Popular&quot;) was King of Portugal from 1861 to 1889. He was a member of the ruling House of Braganza. The second son of Queen Maria II and her consort, King Ferdinand, and born as the Duke of Porto, he acceded to the throne upon the death of his elder brother King Pedro V.

== Infante of Portugal ==
Prince Luís was born on 31 October 1838, at 11.30pm. Although his status as second son did not suggest that Luís would ascend to the Portuguese throne, his education was meticulous and largely shared with his older brother, the Royal Prince Pedro: he was tutored by the counsellor Carl Andreas Dietz, who had been his father Fernando&#x27;s preceptor until April 1847, when Dietz was forced to leave Portugal on charges of meddling in national politics associated with his Protestant religious affiliation, and was replaced by the Viscount of Carreira, assisted by Manuel Moreira Coelho.

Pedro and Luís divided their time between the palaces of Mafra, Sintra and Vila Viçosa, as well as sporadic stays at the Palace of Belém.

As the second-born son of the royal couple, Luís embarked on a naval career, having been appointed private in the Company of the Marine Guards and recognized in a ceremony at the Navy Arsenal on October 28, 1846, when he was only 8 years old. He would be promoted successively to second lieutenant (1851), lieutenant captain (1854), frigate captain (1858) and sea captain (1859). He had his first naval command in September 1857, on the brig Pedro Nunes, in which he made a cruise off the coast of Portugal and a trip to Gibraltar. He was appointed, by his brother King Pedro V, commander of the corvette &quot;Bartolomeu Dias&quot;, on June 21, 1858. Commanding the &quot;Bartolomeu Dias&quot;, he completed nine service missions between 1858 and 1860: he led the expedition to the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores; he was responsible for transporting Prince George of Saxony to Lisbon, where he married Infanta Maria Ana, his sister; took the couple to England; traveled to Tangier; and, in 1860, Angola; he went to Madeira again on the orders of Empress Elisabeth of Austria; and brought Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen from Southampton, for his wedding with Infanta Antonia, then took the bride and groom to Anvers.

==Reign==

D. Luís inherited the crown in November 1861, succeeding his brother Pedro V as he left no descendants, and was acclaimed king on 22 December of the same year. On 27 September of the following year, he married Maria Pia of Savoy, daughter of King Vitor Emanuel II of Italy, by proxy.

=== Renouncing Spanish throne ===
After the Glorious Revolution deposed Isabel II of Spain in September 1868, the new &quot;Cortes&quot; began the task of searching for a suitable liberal-leaning candidate from a new dynasty to replace her.

In 1869, Luís I made it public that he did not want to be monarch of Spain and made a point of making that clear both to the Council of Ministers, chaired by the Duke of Loulé, and to the Portuguese people. Two days after his patriotic letter appeared in the Government&#x27;s gazette, it was published in the Diário de Notícias, thus serving the Royal House to deny the rumour that there would be an abdication: &quot;I was born Portuguese, Portuguese I want to die,&quot; proclaimed Luís on the front page of the newspaper on 28 September 1869. If Luís accepted the Spanish crown, he would have to abdicate in Portugal to Carlos, his son of only 6 years, with Ferdinand II as regent, opening up the possibility of an Iberian Union in the medium term. After Luís refused, the Spanish throne was handed over to his brother-in-law, Amadeu of Savoy.

=== Government instability ===
During his reign, and as a result of the creation of the general consumption tax, which was poorly received by public opinion, a riot called &quot;Janeirinha&quot; broke out (at the end of 1867). There was also a military revolt on 19 May 1870, promoted by Marshal Duke of Saldanha, who wanted the government to resign. The monarch responded to the 19 May revolt on 29 August by dismissing Saldanha&#x27;s ministry and calling Sá da Bandeira to power.

In September 1871, Fontes Pereira de Melo came to power and organised a regenerative cabinet, which remained in power until 1877. This was followed by the Duke of Ávila, who couldn&#x27;t hold on for long because he lacked a majority. Thus, after the parliamentary conflict that broke out in 1878, Fontes was called back to form a cabinet. As a result, the progressives accused the king of scandalously patronising the regenerators. This episode encouraged the development of republicanism. In 1879, King Luís called on the progressives to form a government.

These series of transitional governments was called &quot;Rotativism.&quot; The governments at various times were composed by the Progressistas (Liberals) and the Regeneradores (Conservatives), the party generally favoured by King Luís, who secured their long term in office after 1881.

It was during the reign of King Luís I that some of Portugal&#x27;s political parties were founded: the Reformist Party (1865), which came to power in 1868, the Portuguese Socialist Party (1875), under the name of the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, and the Progressive Party (1876), which came to power in 1879. In 1883, the Congress of the Organising Committee of the Portuguese Republican Party was held. By the end of his reign, the Republican Party was already a perfectly structured political force.

=== Culture ===
During his time, the Coimbrã Question (1865–1866) arose and the Casino Conferences (1871) took place, to which the names of Antero de Quental and Eça de Queiroz were linked, the exponents of a generation that became notable in Portuguese intellectual life. At the time these young intellectuals reacted against romantic degeneracy and the country&#x27;s cultural, educational, technological and economic backwardness.

=== Colonial Affairs ===
In 1884, the Berlin Conference took place, resulting in the so-called Pink Map, which defined the division of Africa between the great colonial powers: the German Empire, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Portugal.

During his reign, Delagoa Bay was confirmed as a Portuguese possession in 1875, whilst Belgian activities in the Congo and the 1890 British Ultimatum prevented the Portuguese from colonizing modern-day Zambia and Zimbabwe in order to establish a link between Portuguese Angola and Portuguese Mozambique at the peak of the Scramble for Africa.

=== Political style and achievements ===
With a calm and conciliatory temperament, he was a model constitutional monarch, scrupulously respectful of public freedoms. Of particular note during his reign was the start of work on the ports of Lisbon and Leixões, the extension of the road and railway network, the construction of the Crystal Palace in Porto, the abolition of the death penalty for civil offences, the abolition of slavery in the Kingdom of Portugal and the publication of the first Civil Code.

=== Philanthropy ===
Luís followed in the footsteps of his mother, Maria II, by having cultural associations built and founded. On 1 June 1871, Luís was in Seixal (a town founded by his mother) to witness the founding of the &quot;Sociedade Filarmónica União Seixalense&quot;. On the same day, the Franco-Prussian War ended.

==Personal interests==
With great artistic sensitivity, he painted, composed and played the cello and piano. A polyglot, he spoke some European languages correctly, and enjoyed writing vernacular poetry. He made translations of works by William Shakespeare, such as &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, &quot;Richard III&quot; and &quot;Othello, the Moor of Venice&quot;. His best-known work in Portugal was his translation of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

Luís was also a man of science, with a passion for oceanography. He invested a large part of his fortune in financing scientific projects and oceanographic research vessels, which travelled the oceans in search of specimens. He successfully practised photography.

==Marriage and descendants==

In June 1862, Luís asked Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria (1845–1927), a daughter of Archduke Albert, Duke of Teschen and Princess Hildegard of Bavaria, to marry him in a letter sent to her father. It was urgent for him to get married as his older brother, King Pedro V, had died in November 1861, without issue and two of his younger brothers, João and Fernando, followed him shortly after, which left the Braganza dynasty almost without heirs. Luís had already selected a number of brides including Princess Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1845–1912), sister of his late sister-in-law Stephanie, Duchess Sophie Charlotte in Bavaria (1847–1897), Princess Maria Pia of Savoy (1847–1911) and also considered some Austrian archduchesses, Maria Theresa being one of them, but didn&#x27;t know which one to choose. So he sent letters to his cousin, Queen Victoria, and his great-uncle, King Leopold I of Belgium, to ask for their advice. Both agreed that the best choice was Maria Theresa. Thus, King Luís sent his letter. However, his wish was not fulfilled as her father, Archduke Albert, thought she was too young at the time (she was one month away from turning 17) and needed to finish her education. Two weeks after, Luís asked for the hand of Princess Maria Pia of Savoy and, this time, was accepted, even though Maria Pia, born in 1847, was even younger than Maria Theresa.

Luís married Maria Pia, the daughter of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and Maria Adelaide of Austria, on 6 October 1862. They both had a deep love at first, but Luís&#x27;s countless mistresses led Maria Pia to depression. Together they had two sons:

* Dom Carlos, Prince Royal of Portugal (28 September 1863 – 1 February 1908), successor as King Carlos I; murdered by the Carbonária.
* Dom Afonso, Prince Royal of Portugal (31 July 1865 – 21 February 1920), Infante of Portugal, Duke of Porto, Viceroy of India, and after 1908 Prince Royal.

==Illness and death==
Luís was a lifelong womanizer. He had a series of extra-marital affairs, the more notorious one with actress Rosa Damasceno. Queen Maria Pia was displeased at first, but later tolerated her husband&#x27;s infidelities, ending up having her own affairs when she traveled abroad.

Sometime in his adult life, Luís contracted syphilis. The infection remained dormant for several years but in 1887 it became persistently manifest, taking its toll. Within two years it had evolved to neurosyphilis, killing the patient after prolonged and 
tiating suffering, on 19 October 1889, at 11:00 a.m.

<text>The Minnesota House of Representatives is the lower chamber of the U.S. state of Minnesota&#x27;s legislature. It operates in conjunction with the Minnesota Senate, the state&#x27;s upper chamber, to write and pass legislation, which is then subject to approval by the governor of Minnesota.

Established in 1858, the Minnesota House of Representatives has 134 members elected from single-member districts across the state. Representatives serve two-year terms without term limits, with all seats up for election every two years. The House is led by the Speaker, who is elected by members of the House, while political party leadership is governed by the Majority and Minority Leaders.

The Minnesota House of Representatives meets in the north wing of the State Capitol in Saint Paul. Member and staff offices, as well as most committee hearings, are in the nearby State Office Building.

==History==
The Minnesota House of Representatives was officially established on May 11, 1858, when Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd state in the Union. It replaced the Minnesota Territorial Legislature. It was formed alongside the Minnesota Senate to create the Minnesota State Legislature, the bicameral legislative body of the state.

In 1913, Minnesota legislators began to be elected on nonpartisan ballots. While campaigning and caucusing, legislators identified themselves as &quot;Liberals&quot; or &quot;Conservatives.&quot; In 1973, a law change brought party designations back, beginning with the 1974 Minnesota House of Representatives election. 

After the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified in 1920, women were eligible for election to the legislature. In 1922, Mabeth Hurd Paige, Hannah Kempfer, Sue Metzger Dickey Hough, and Myrtle Cain were elected to the House of Representatives. As of 2023, a record-high 54 women serve in the House.

==Elections==
Each Senate district is divided in half and given the suffix &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; (for example, House district 32B is in Senate district 32). Members are elected to two-year terms. Districts are redrawn after the decennial United States Census in time for the primary and general elections in years ending in 2. The most recent election was on November 5, 2024.

==Composition==
:&quot;94th Minnesota Legislature (2025–2027)&quot;

===Members, 2025-2027===
The 94th Minnesota Legislature began on January 14, 2025. 67 representatives were elected to each major party, the second ever tie in the Minnesota House. After the election of Curtis Johnson (District 40B) was nullified in court, the session began with 67 Republican members, while the 66 elected DFL members sat out in an effort to deny quorum.

<text>The Minnesota Senate is the upper house of the Legislature of the U.S. state of Minnesota. At 67 members, half as many as the Minnesota House of Representatives, it is the largest upper house of any U.S. state legislature. Floor sessions are held in the west wing of the State Capitol in Saint Paul. Committee hearings, as well as offices for senators and staff, are located north of the State Capitol in the Minnesota Senate Building. Each member of the Minnesota Senate represents approximately 80,000 constituents.

==History==
The Minnesota Senate held its first regular session on December 2, 1857.

==Powers==
In addition to its legislative powers, certain appointments by the governor are subject to the Senate&#x27;s advice and consent. As state law provides for hundreds of executive appointments, the vast majority of appointees serve without being confirmed by the Senate; only in rare instances does the Senate reject appointees. It has rejected only nine executive appointments since 2000.

==Elections==
Each Senate district is split between an &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; House district (e.g., Senate District 41 contains House districts 41A and 41B). The Minnesota Constitution forbids House districts that are within more than one Senate district.

To account for decennial redistricting, members run for one two-year term and two four-year terms each decade. Senators are elected to four-year terms in years ending in 2 and 6, and to two-year terms in years ending in 0. Districts are redrawn after the decennial United States Census in time for the primary and general elections in years ending in 2. The most recent election was held on November 8, 2022.

==Leadership==
From statehood through 1972, the lieutenant governor served as president of the Senate. In 1972, voters approved a constitutional amendment that provided for the Senate to elect its own president beginning January 1973. The president, who presides over official Senate proceedings, also acts as the parliamentarian and oversees the secretary of the senate.
The majority leader is responsible for managing and scheduling the business of the Senate and oversees partisan and nonpartisan staff. The current majority leader is Erin Murphy, a Democrat from Saint Paul. The current minority leader is Mark Johnson, a Republican from East Grand Forks. Each caucus also selects its own leaders and deputy leaders.

== Minnesota Senate Building ==
Committee hearings mostly take place in the Minnesota Senate Building, a office building that opened in January 2016. The $90 million office building, which is north of the State Capitol across University Avenue, includes three committee hearing rooms, offices for all senators and staff, a raised terrace overlooking the State Capitol, and a 264-space underground parking facility.

The 2016 session was held in the newly constructed Minnesota Senate Building due to an extensive restoration at the State Capitol. It was the first time the Senate held a regular session outside the Capitol since it opened in 1905.

<doc id="254416" wikidata="Q7591267" url="?curid=254416" title="St. Paul Saints">
<text>The St. Paul Saints are a Minor League Baseball team of the International League and the Triple-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. They are located in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and have played their home games at CHS Field since 2015. They previously played at Midway Stadium from 1993 to 2014.

From their founding in 1993 through 2020, the Saints were an independent baseball team with no affiliation with Major League Baseball (MLB). They played in the Northern League from 1993 to 2005 and the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball from 2006 to 2020. The Saints became an MLB-affiliated team in conjunction with the reorganization of the minor leagues beginning with the 2021 season. They were placed in the Triple-A East, but this was renamed the International League in 2022.

Before the arrival of the Minnesota Twins from Washington, D.C., in 1961, there was a long history of minor league baseball teams called the St. Paul Saints, as well as their crosstown rivals the Minneapolis Millers. One incarnation of the Saints participated in the Union Association, a short-lived major league, in 1884. A second incarnation was active in the Western League from 1894 to 1899, and became a forerunner of the modern Chicago White Sox. The third and most long-lived incarnation of the Saints was active in the American Association from 1915 to 1960.

== History ==
===St. Paul Saints (1894–1899)===

As described in Lee Allen&#x27;s book, &quot;The American League Story&quot; (Putnam, 1962), the team began as the Sioux City Cornhuskers franchise in a minor league called the Western League. This circuit had reorganized itself in November 1893, with Ban Johnson as president. Johnson, a Cincinnati-based reporter, had been recommended by his friend Charles Comiskey, former major league star with the St. Louis Browns in the 1880s, who was then managing the Cincinnati Reds. After the 1894 season, when Comiskey&#x27;s contract with the Reds was up, he decided to take his chances at ownership. He bought the Sioux City team and transferred it to St. Paul, where it enjoyed some success over the next five seasons.

In 1900, the Western League changed its name to the American League. It was still officially a minor league, a part of the National Agreement and an underling of the National League. The National League gave permission to the American League to put a team in Chicago, and on March 21, 1900, Comiskey moved his St. Paul club to the South Side, where they became the Chicago White Sox.

===St. Paul Saints (1901–1960)===

Another team called the Saints played Minor League Baseball in the American Association from 1901 to 1960. The Saints finished first in the American Association nine times, and won the Little World Series in 1924. During this period, the Saints were a farm club of the Chicago White Sox (1936–1942), the Brooklyn Dodgers (1944–1957), and the Los Angeles Dodgers (1958–1960).

During the 1948 season, Brooklyn Dodger Roy Campanella was reassigned to the Saints. On May 18, he become the first person to break the color barrier in the American Association when he took the field in a game.

The Saints played streetcar home and away double headers with their local rivals, the Minneapolis Millers. When the Minnesota Twins came to town in 1961, the Saints became the Omaha Dodgers while the Millers ceased operations and their role as affiliate to the Boston Red Sox was filled by the Seattle Rainiers. Lexington Park served as the Saints&#x27; home stadium for most of those years.

During the six decades of the original American Association minor league, the Minneapolis Millers and St. Paul Saints engaged in vigorous rivalry known as the Streetcar Series. This series has been documented in a book by Rex Hamann entitled &quot;The Millers and the Saints, Baseball Championships of the Twin Cities Rivals&quot; (2014).

===Current franchise===
====Independent baseball (1993–2020)====

The current inception of the St. Paul Saints was formed in 1993 in the Northern League, one of several independent leagues not affiliated with Major League Baseball. The Saints are known for promotions that are sometimes over-the-top even by the standards of Minor League Baseball. In this regard, Mike Veeck, owner of the team from its inception until 2023, was seen as following in the footsteps of his father Bill Veeck, who was famous for conceiving outlandish promotions as an owner of the major league St. Louis Browns, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox. Marvin Goldklang and actor Bill Murray were also founders and owners of the team with Veeck until 2023.

Despite the considerable naysaying at their inception, the Saints became one of the most successful teams in the Northern League and all of independent baseball. From 2002 to 2004, the Saints saw severely reduced attendance, owing partially to renewed interest in the Minnesota Twins of Major League Baseball, who won the 2002, 2003, and 2004 American League Central Division championships. In spite of an initially cool, if not outright hostile reception, the Saints and their major league neighbor (less than away) have worked together for several years to promote the sport of baseball.

The Saints have figured prominently in the creation of modern independent baseball. The team has been featured in books (&quot;Rebel Baseball&quot; by Steve Perlstein, 1993; &quot;Slouching Toward Fargo&quot; by Neal Karlen, 1998) and a cable network series (&quot;Baseball, Minnesota&quot;, FX Network, 1996–97). Mike Veeck wrote a book that covered the mantra &quot;Fun is Good&quot; (2005) and describes the business approach he has used for many years. The team&#x27;s history is also featured in the documentary film For The Fun Of The Game, which was released in 2018.

On May 31, 1997, the Saints became the first professional men&#x27;s baseball team since integration to have a female on their roster. Ila Borders, a pitcher, played with the team out of the bullpen for a month before being traded.

On September 29, 2005, the Saints left the Northern League, along with the Lincoln Saltdogs, Sioux City Explorers, and the Sioux Falls Pheasants to start the American Association for the 2006 season.

In June 2009, the Saints began a push to build a new stadium in Downtown Saint Paul. The proposed 7,500-seat stadium would be located in the Lowertown neighborhood near a planned maintenance facility for the METRO Green Line light rail. The city of Saint Paul requested $25 million in its 2010 bonding wish list to the Minnesota Legislature.

During their final 5 years in the American Association and their first 5 years in CHS Field, the Saints consistently led the league in attendance, averaging more than 8,000 fans in the regular season during the period of
2015-19.

In 2020, the Saints competed as one of six teams in a condensed 60-game season as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. They played much of their season away from their home stadium, CHS Field, and were instead based at Sioux Falls Stadium, where they shared a home field with the Sioux Falls Canaries. On August 4, 2020, the Saints returned to play at CHS Field.

The beginnings of a closer relationship with the local Major League Baseball franchise, the Minnesota Twins, came in the summer of 2020. Due to the pandemic, the 2020 MLB season was modified in several ways, including the cancellation of the 2020 Minor League Baseball season. Because of this, teams were allowed to use taxi squads located at nearby facilities where non-active minor league players were allowed to train. The Twins made use of the Saints&#x27; CHS Field facilities as home for their taxi squad.

Notable players to have played for the Saints during their independent baseball years include Shane Costa, Glenn Davis, J. D. Drew, Leon &quot;Bull&quot; Durham, Gavin Fingleson, Dan Johnson, Brandon Kintzler, Kevin Millar, Minnie Miñoso, Jack Morris, Darryl Motley, Matt Nokes, Rey Ordóñez, Tanner Scheppers, Dave Stevens, Darryl Strawberry and Caleb Thielbar.

====Affiliated baseball (2021–present)====

Due to the 2021 full-scale reorganization of Minor League Baseball, there was much speculation as to what would happen to independent leagues such as the American Association and specifically the Saints. On November 11, 2020, it was reported that the Minnesota Twins ended their 18-year affiliation with their Triple-A affiliate, the Rochester Red Wings. At this time it was also reported that the Saints were a front-runner to be the Twins&#x27; new Triple-A affiliate. The main barrier to a deal was said to be the $20 million fee required for affiliation. The Twins aided in this by becoming minority shareholders in the Saints and placing their Triple-A affiliation in St. Paul beginning with the 2021 season. The Saints were organized into the Triple-A East. At a distance of 12.9 miles (along Interstate 94, including surface streets), CHS Field is the closest Triple-A ballpark to its MLB parent team.

The Saints began competition as a Twins affiliate on May 4, 2021, with an 8–2 loss to the Omaha Storm Chasers at Werner Park in Papillion, Nebraska. St. Paul ended the season in third place in the Midwestern Division with a 61–59 record. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. St. Paul finished the tournament tied for seventh place with a 6–4 record. In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

In March 2023, it was announced that The Goldklang Group was selling the team to Diamond Baseball Holdings for an undisclosed sum. Diamond Baseball Holdings owns a number of minor league teams, including the Iowa Cubs and the Minnesota Twins&#x27; Class AA affiliate Wichita Wind Surge.

==Roster==
==Notable promotions==
In an attempt to gain publicity in a metropolitan area that hosts five major pro sports teams and a major college program, the Saints create unique promotions that have received media attention numerous times.
*The Saints celebrated the 40th anniversary of &quot;Animal House&quot; on August 14, 2018, by staging the world&#x27;s largest food fight after the completion of the fifth inning against the Sioux Falls Canaries. Approximately 8,000 fans participated.
*On August 22, 2017, the Saints held the world&#x27;s largest Twister game, with over 56,000 dots painted on the outfield grass.
*On July 21, 2015, in an event sponsored by My Pillow, the world&#x27;s largest pillow fight was held after the second inning, with 6,261 participants. The event was hosted by Stephen Baldwin. Additionally, in honor of the 40th season of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, former cast member Joe Piscopo performed the national anthem in his impression of Frank Sinatra, and made other appearances throughout the game.
* A May 11, 2013, exhibition game between the Saints and Gary SouthShore Railcats was played without umpires. The team instead had a judge, in a judicial robe, call balls and strikes from behind the pitcher. Calls at first and third bases were made by a &quot;jury&quot; of 12 Little League players, with the judge able to overrule any calls.
*In August 2012, as part of a regional conference held by the Minnesota Atheists, the Saints held &quot;A Night of Unbelievable Fun&quot;, where the team wore alternate jerseys branding themselves as the &quot;Mr. Paul Aint&#x27;s&quot;. The promotion was reprised in subsequent seasons.
* On July 23, 2011, the Saints celebrated National Hot Dog Day and parodied Anthony Weiner and his first sexting scandal. The first 1,501 fans age 18 or older received &quot;Tweeting Wiener Boxer Shorts&quot;, depicting a blue bird taking a picture of a hot dog, or &quot;wiener&quot;. The bird was deliberately drawn to resemble the logo of Twitter, the social media site that Weiner used to send links to indecent photos.
*The Saints announced a giveaway for their May 23, 2009, game against the Sioux Falls Pheasants of 2,500 bobblehead dolls dressed as the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; character Count von Count, supposedly celebrating the 40th anniversary of the series. The Saints&#x27; version of this doll, however, had the face of Al Franken on one side and Norm Coleman on the other and was named &quot;Count von Re-Count&quot;—referring to the prolonged recount in the 2008 U.S. Senate election between the two men. The Saints made further jabs at the race:
** The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Dean Barkley, who ran in that election as a third-party candidate.
** Fans were asked during the game to spin the heads of their dolls to either Coleman or Franken. Attorneys were present to count the &quot;votes&quot; from this process, poking fun at the extensive involvement of attorneys in the recount process. The team&#x27;s website stated that fans could challenge the &quot;results&quot; at the team&#x27;s Fan Services booth during the game.
** The team also facetiously stated on its site that it would not make the results of that night&#x27;s game official until mid-June—around the time that the entire Minnesota Supreme Court was scheduled to rule on Coleman&#x27;s appeal of a panel ruling that Franken had won. (The Court issued its ruling in Franken&#x27;s favor on June 30, with Coleman then conceding.)
*In May 2008, the Saints announced the giveaway of 2,500 bobble foot dolls, ostensibly to celebrate National Tap Dance Day. The dolls, which featured two feet visible beneath the door of a bathroom stall, were covered in the national news for their reference to Senator Larry Craig, who pled guilty to soliciting sex in a Minneapolis–Saint Paul Airport restroom in August 2007.
*In August 2007, the Saints announced that rubber dog toys would be given out, as a jab to the federal dogfighting case involving Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick.
*In April 2006, the Saints announced that rubber boats would be given out during a May 27, 2006 game, to honor the 30th anniversary of the television show &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. However, details of the promotion indicated that it was intended as a jab at the 2005 boat scandal involving the Minnesota Vikings, where several members of the team were allegedly involved in illicit behavior on a private cruise. The promotional rubber boats used the same color as the Vikings uniforms (purple and yellow) and were named &quot;Minnetonka Queen&quot; (a reference to Lake Minnetonka, where the cruise took place).
*On May 8, 2005, the Saints hosted a Mother&#x27;s Day exhibition game against the Sioux Falls Canaries which began at 5:35 a.m. and set an unofficial record for earliest game time in baseball history. 2,253 fans attended the 6-6 tie, with about 500 of them tailgating overnight in the parking lot. Free cereal was given away and all ticket sales went to charity.
*In August 2004, the Saints held a Bobblehead Election to tap into the campaign buzz around the election year. Fans were told to select either a John Kerry or George Bush bobblehead as their &quot;vote.&quot; The stunt was capped off with a speech by the winning bobblehead. A real donkey and a donkey dressed like an elephant (the Saints were unable to obtain a real elephant) added to the atmosphere.
*In August 2003, the Saints held &quot;Randy Moss Hood Ornament Night&quot;, poking fun at Randy Moss, then a wide receiver for the Vikings. Earlier that year, Moss was involved in an incident where he bumped a traffic control officer with his car while he attempted to make a turn.
*During the 2002 Major League Baseball labor negotiations, the Saints gave away seat cushions with pictures of commissioner Bud Selig on one side and player&#x27;s association Executive Director Donald Fehr on the other.
*In 2002, in response to Selig&#x27;s controversial decision to end the MLB All-Star Game in a 7–7 tie, the Saints gave out neckties (or &quot;ties&quot;) with Bud Selig&#x27;s image.

<doc id="254418" wikidata="Q1200814" url="?curid=254418" title="Desmond O'Malley">
<text>Desmond Joseph O&#x27;Malley (2 February 1939 – 21 July 2021) was an Irish politician who served as Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1977 to 1981 and 1989 to 1992, Leader of the Progressive Democrats from 1985 to 1993, Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism from March 1982 to October 1982, Minister for Justice from 1970 to 1973 and Government Chief Whip and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence from 1969 to 1970. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Limerick East constituency from 1968 to 2002.

A prominent Fianna Fáil member and government minister in the 1970s and 1980s, O&#x27;Malley was expelled from the party in 1985. He founded the Progressive Democrats and served as the party&#x27;s first leader from 1985 until 1993. He retired from politics at the 2002 general election.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Malley was born in Limerick in 1939. His family had long been involved in politics: His maternal grandfather, Denis O&#x27;Donovan, was killed during the War of Independence by the Black and Tans, two of his uncles and his father held the office of Mayor of Limerick, and his uncle Donogh O&#x27;Malley was a Minister for Education.

O&#x27;Malley was educated at the Jesuit Crescent College and at University College Dublin, from which he graduated with a degree in law in 1962.

He was married to Pat McAleer, who predeceased him in 2017. They had six children, 4 daughters and two sons, including Fiona O&#x27;Malley.

==Entering politics==
In 1968, his uncle and sitting TD Donogh O&#x27;Malley died suddenly. Initially, Donogh&#x27;s widow Hilda was asked by Fianna Fáil to stand in the coming by-election to try and retain the seat for the party. However, as Hilda was still in shock because of her husband&#x27;s sudden death she declined and instead, after a canvass of many O&#x27;Malleys, Desmond O&#x27;Malley was selected and he stood in the subsequent by-election to fill the vacant seat. Desmond was successful and was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Limerick East constituency. At the time it was believed that this by-election victory by just 900 votes was partly due to Neil Blaney and his &quot;Donegal Mafia&quot;. Blaney would subsequently deeply regret aiding O&#x27;Malley in his election as he always felt that Des was in the wrong party. The relationship between Desmond and Hilda was strained following Desmond&#x27;s victory after Hilda had a change of heart about entering politics. She requested that Desmond stand aside in the 1969 general election in favour of her becoming the main Fianna Fáil candidate, but Desmond refused. Both Desmond and Hilda stood in Limerick East in that 1969 Election, with Desmond for Fianna Fáil and Hilda as an Independent. Desmond came third while Hilda finished fifth in the four-seat constituency. Desmond was elected while Hilda just missed out. The &quot;O&#x27;Malley vs O&#x27;Malley&quot; dynamic of what was a very acrimonious contest drew enormous interest and discussion, to the point of attracting international headlines.

==Arms Crisis and Minister for Justice==
After the 1969 general election, O&#x27;Malley was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, Jim Gibbons. O&#x27;Malley had a central role in the case for the prosecution against the government ministers Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney that arose from the Arms Crisis of 1970. Both ministers were acquitted in a trial at the Central Criminal Court.

It has been alleged by numerous scholars that O&#x27;Malley was aware of Taoiseach Jack Lynch&#x27;s lawful efforts to procure arms for northern Nationalists, to be kept under lock and key at a secure location at a monastery in County Cavan, and the training of young men, hand-picked by the Citizens&#x27; Defence Committees to be instructed in their use by the Irish Defence Forces. It has been alleged that O&#x27;Malley was aware of a ministerial memo that unambiguously stated:
A transport of army trucks with 500 rifles, 80,000 rounds of ammunition and respirators was indeed sent to the North but did not cross the border, in April 1970 (following orders Defence Minister Gibbons issued in February of that year), instead the trucks were parked at Aitken barracks in Dundalk. Owing to a lack of sufficient space, all but 150 rifles were returned south immediately, and the remainder in May 1970, ostensibly due to a fear the barracks could be raided by the IRA. As O&#x27;Malley was a junior minister in the Dept. of Defence, it is highly unlikely that he was not aware of the relevant handwritten memo suggesting their removal from Aitken Barracks. This memo, as with the one above, was not admitted as evidence at the Arms Trial, perhaps because it might have aroused suspicion as to the Irish Department of Defence&#x27;s intentions in moving so many weapons and for what purpose. It has been suggested that the arms were to be temporarily stored there whilst Captain James Kelly procured the intended weapons from Germany, under instruction from the Defence Minister, Jim Gibbons and the Army Director of Intelligence, Colonel Michael Hefferon.

In 1970, O&#x27;Malley succeeded Mícheál Ó Móráin as Minister for Justice. At age 31, O&#x27;Malley was the youngest Minister for Justice since Kevin O&#x27;Higgins who had presided over the tumultuous post-revolutionary period in Ireland in the 1920s following the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War.

It has also been alleged that O&#x27;Malley had later become aware of IRA Chief of Staff Seán Mac Stíofáin&#x27;s status as a &#x27;misinformer&#x27;, who whilst on the Gárda payroll fed misinformation to the Gárda Special Branch intelligence directorate known as C3. 

O’Malley knew that there was an informer because he mentions this fact in his memoirs – where he reveals that the Garda received a &quot;tip-off&quot; from an informer about the arms importation attempt that sparked the Arms Crisis of 1970. The informer was Seán Mac Stíofáin, who did so to discredit the Jack Lynch government and prevent the development of a potential rival military organisation - the Citizens&#x27; Defence Committees. Mac Stíofáin had sourced superior weapons independently from the United States and wished to eliminate the possibility of these weapons falling into the hands of his arch rival, Cathal Goulding, the leader of the Marxist rump faction, the Official IRA, whom the media alleged the weapons were destined for. Curiously, in Taoiseach Jack Lynch&#x27;s account given to Dáil Éireann, in which no informer is mentioned and that the arms were discovered quite by accident by Dublin Airport Staff. 

As Minister for Justice, O&#x27;Malley reinforced the Offences Against the State Act so that a person could be convicted of IRA membership on the word of a Garda Superintendent. He also introduced the Special Criminal Court, a juryless court presided over by three judges which tries cases of terrorism and serious organised crime, with the cited raison d&#x27;être being to avoid witness intimidation. O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s plans to introduce internment without trial for Provisional IRA suspects in the Republic were not implemented, but following an assassination threat by the IRA he was permitted to carry a handgun at all times and was frequently moved from house to house.

O&#x27;Malley also introduced the Forcible Entry Bill, brought in to counter student agitation over the demolition of valued buildings. This move was bitterly despised by students in University College Dublin, who pelted him with eggs during a meeting in retaliation.

Journalists sympathetic to the Official IRA and its political wing, Sinn Féin The Workers Party (from the 1982 as Workers&#x27; Party (Ireland)), in both The Irish Times and RTÉ, such as Dick Walsh, Seán Cronin, Gerry Gregg and Eoghan Harris perpetuated the myth borne out of the Arms Trial that, despite being acquitted of wrongdoing, Charles Haughey helped establish the Provisional IRA through the illegal importation of arms and lionized Taoiseach Jack Lynch and Des O&#x27;Malley as the defenders of constitutional democracy, with the latter forming the Progressive Democrats, when in fact Lynch quite lawfully ordered the importation of the arms, very likely with O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s knowledge and that of others. But given the poor relations between the British and Irish governments at the time, to admit such would have been incendiary. Official IRA supporters in the media reviled the Provisional IRA and laid the blame for the 1970 split at the door of Charles Haughey, whom they accused of importing the arms to foment that very split, as Fianna Fáil feared a leftwing political competitor. Seán Mac Stíofáin&#x27;s IRA rapidly eclipsed the &#x27;Officials&#x27; (or, &quot;Stickies&quot;, as they became known) in men and manpower and the Official IRA declared a permanent ceasefire in 1972 (though continued to participate in feuding, murder and gangsterism for over a decade afterwards). Onwards into the 1980s and 1990s, other Irish Times luminaries, such as Fintan O&#x27;Toole, held to this myth as an explanation to the origin of the 1970 split, owing to a deep antipathy towards Charles Haughey personally and by contrast, Des O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s stature as a paragon of virtue. But O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s failure to act on intelligence concerning Seán Mac Stíofáin&#x27;s activities would have exposed him as incompetent, in addition to untruthful concerning his knowledge of Jack Lynch&#x27;s role in the importation of arms. Not until Seán Mac Stíofáin&#x27;s role as a (mis)informer was revealed did the political narrative changed.

==In opposition==
Following the 1973 general election Fianna Fáil were ousted from government for the first time in 16 years by Fine Gael and Labour, who had agreed to a pre-election pact to form a coalition should they win. In 1974 O&#x27;Malley cast doubts over the Fine Gael and Labour brokered Sunningdale Agreement, declaring &quot;Ireland is one Ireland, one nation, one country because God made it one&quot;. O&#x27;Malley also opposed the government&#x27;s attempts to end the ban in Ireland of the sale of contraceptives. When a supreme court judge declared that &quot;the deterrence of fornication and promiscuity&quot; was &quot;a legitimate legislative aim and a matter not of private but of public morality&quot;, O&#x27;Malley publicly agreed. O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s view on this matter would evolve over time and later in his career, radically alter his relationship with Fianna Fáil.

==Fianna Fáil majority==
At the 1977 general election, Fianna Fáil received a 23-seat majority in Dáil Éireann. O&#x27;Malley was appointed as Minister for Industry and Commerce at a time when Ireland&#x27;s economic fortunes were going into rapid decline. In 1979, following Jack Lynch&#x27;s resignation as Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil, two candidates fought in the leadership election, George Colley and Charles Haughey. O&#x27;Malley and Martin O&#x27;Donoghue managed Colley&#x27;s campaign, but Haughey won. Colley and O&#x27;Malley retained their positions in the government, but O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s department was scrapped.

==Opposition to Haughey==
Following the February 1982 general election, Fianna Fáil, led by Haughey, failed to win an overall majority in the Dáil. Haughey was seen as the main reason for the election defeat. George Colley threw his support behind O&#x27;Malley as a leadership challenger, but no vote on the party leadership was taken. Haughey was elected Taoiseach again after negotiating confidence and supply arrangements with Sinn Féin The Workers&#x27; Party and two independents. O&#x27;Malley was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.

A large number of TDs quickly grew disillusioned with Haughey&#x27;s leadership and threw their support behind O&#x27;Malley in an effort to oust the incumbent leader. On 1 October 1982, a challenge to Haughey was initiated by a Kildare TD, Charlie McCreevy. O&#x27;Malley was on holiday in Spain at the time but rushed back to put his own name forward as a possible alternative to Haughey. He and his supporters resigned from the Cabinet. Haughey won an open vote by 58 votes to 22, with the result that those TDs who voted against Haughey, including O&#x27;Malley, became known as the Gang of 22.

In December 1982, a Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition government took office and its Minister for Justice, Michael Noonan, revealed that Haughey&#x27;s government had been involved in the tapping of certain journalists&#x27; telephones. This set off another leadership struggle, with O&#x27;Malley, Gerry Collins, Michael O&#x27;Kennedy, Brian Lenihan and John Wilson all showing an interest in replacing Haughey. However, an official inquiry into the telephone tapping cleared Haughey of any wrongdoing and put more blame on Martin O&#x27;Donoghue than the other TDs involved. Haughey retained the leadership by 40 votes to 33.

George Colley died in 1983 and Martin O&#x27;Donoghue was no longer a TD. O&#x27;Malley became isolated within Fianna Fáil, with many of his supporters giving up hope of ever beating Haughey.

==Expulsion from Fianna Fáil==
In May 1984, the New Ireland Forum report was published. Haughey had been a key figure in the Forum and had agreed to several possible solutions for solving the problem of Northern Ireland. However, he responded to the publication by declaring that the only possible solution was a united Ireland. O&#x27;Malley strongly criticised this position and accused Haughey of stifling debate. At a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party to discuss the report the whip was removed from O&#x27;Malley.

In early 1985, the Fine Gael–Labour Party government introduced the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill 1985 to liberalise the sale of contraceptives. Fianna Fáil opposed the bill, but O&#x27;Malley considered it a matter of conscience and wanted to support it. O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s speech was later praised as one of the best ever delivered in the Dáil. His famous phrase became &quot;I stand by the Republic&quot; stated during the extensive debates:

When the bill came to a vote, he abstained. However, that did not save him from Haughey&#x27;s fury. On 26 February 1985, he was summoned to a party meeting and charged with &quot;conduct unbecoming&quot;. Following a roll-call vote, he was expelled from Fianna Fáil by 73 votes to 9.

==Progressive Democrats==
Immediately afterwards, Desmond O&#x27;Malley was contacted by a young Fine Gael activist, Michael McDowell, who encouraged O&#x27;Malley to found a new political party and offered any help he could give. On 21 December 1985, O&#x27;Malley announced the formation of the Progressive Democrats. He was joined by Mary Harney (like O&#x27;Malley, an independent TD expelled from Fianna Fáil), and later by Fianna Fáil TDs Bobby Molloy and Pearse Wyse and Fine Gael TD Michael Keating. At the 1987 general election, the Progressive Democrats won 14 seats, making the new party the third-biggest in the Dáil. Among the TDs elected for the new party were O&#x27;Malley and his cousin Patrick O&#x27;Malley; Anne Colley, daughter of George Colley; Martin Gibbons, son of Jim Gibbons; Michael McDowell and Martin Cullen. Fianna Fáil returned to power with Haughey as head of a minority government.

==Coalition with Fianna Fáil==
In May 1989, Haughey called an early general election in the hope of winning an overall majority, but Fianna Fáil actually lost seats. The Progressive Democrats also lost seats, but held the balance of power. Haughey failed to be elected Taoiseach, as the Progressive Democrats voted for Fine Gael&#x27;s leader Alan Dukes, but after Haughey formally resigned as Taoiseach he entered into negotiations with the Progressive Democrats to form a coalition. On 5 July 1989, Haughey and O&#x27;Malley agreed a deal for government, and O&#x27;Malley was appointed Minister for Industry and Commerce.

In 1990, Fianna Fáil&#x27;s nominee in the presidential election was Brian Lenihan. A few weeks before the election a scandal broke over the accusation that Lenihan had phoned the President, Patrick Hillery in 1982, asking him not to dissolve the Dáil following the fall of Garret FitzGerald&#x27;s government. Lenihan had always denied this, but now new evidence had come to light. O&#x27;Malley told Haughey that the Progressive Democrats would pull out of the coalition and support a no-confidence motion tabled by the opposition unless Lenihan left the government or Haughey opened an investigation into the incident. Haughey sacked Lenihan.

In early 1992, the programme for government was up for renewal. When it was revealed by Seán Doherty that Haughey had authorised the tapping of two journalists&#x27; telephones in 1982, O&#x27;Malley decided that the Progressive Democrats could no longer remain in his government. Haughey resigned on 11 February 1992 and was replaced as party leader and Taoiseach by Albert Reynolds. O&#x27;Malley and the Progressive Democrats continued in the coalition until Reynolds accused O&#x27;Malley of being &quot;dishonest&quot; while giving evidence to the Beef Tribunal. The collapse of the coalition that November led to the 1992 general election. Fianna Fáil returned to government in a coalition with the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats moved into opposition.

==Retirement and later life==
In October 1993, O&#x27;Malley retired as leader of the Progressive Democrats. He was succeeded by Mary Harney, one of the co-founders of the party. In 1994, O&#x27;Malley ran for the European Parliament but was defeated by Pat Cox, a sitting MEP who left the Progressive Democrats to run as an independent when O&#x27;Malley was selected as the candidate to replace him. O&#x27;Malley remained as a TD until his retirement from politics at the 2002 general election, when he was succeeded as TD by his cousin Tim O&#x27;Malley. His daughter Fiona O&#x27;Malley was elected to the Dáil as a Progressive Democrats TD. His son Eoin O&#x27;Malley is a political scientist in the School of Law and Government at Dublin City University.

In October 2014 he released a memoir, &quot;Conduct Unbecoming: A Memoir&quot;. The book received mixed reviews. The &quot;Irish Examiner&quot; described it as &quot;pungent and to the point&quot; while historian Diarmuid Ferriter, writing for the &quot;Irish Times&quot;, dismissed it as &quot;an infuriatingly bad and poorly-written book&quot;, noting that &quot;all sorts of assertions are made without evidence or elaboration and this approach is maintained throughout the book, underlining the lack of coherence or focus&quot;. Ferriter also took issue with a number of claims made by O&#x27;Malley particularly regarding the Arms Crisis.

O&#x27;Malley died on 21 July 2021 at the age of 82, having been in poor health for some time.

<text>The Minneapolis Millers were an American professional minor league baseball team that played in Minneapolis, Minnesota, through 1960. In the 19th century a different Minneapolis Millers were part of the Western League. The team played first in Athletic Park and later Nicollet Park. 

==History==
The name Minneapolis Millers has been associated with a variety of professional minor league teams. The original Millers date back to 1884 when the Northwestern League was formed. This league failed and the Western League replaced it, absorbing some of the old teams. According to Stew Thornley, this team folded in 1891 due to financial problems. In 1894, another team calling itself the Millers was formed when Ban Johnson and Charles Comiskey revived the Western League in hopes of making it a second major league. The Millers continued to play in the Western League through 1900, when the name was changed to the American League to give it more of a national image. Following the 1900 season, several cities were abandoned for bigger markets in cities recently vacated by the National League, including Minneapolis. Some teams were transferred, as was the case of the Kansas City Blues franchise to become the Washington Nationals (Senators). However, some of the teams were just left out in the dark. It is unclear which of these two paths the Millers took, but most evidence seems to point toward abandonment, not a transfer to Baltimore as the Orioles, especially given that no player for the 1900 Millers played for the 1901 Orioles.

Several teams went by the nickname Millers, but the most prominent of these was the team in the American Association from 1902 to 1960. The Millers won four Association pennants during the 1910–23 tenure of &quot;Pongo Joe&quot; Cantillon, then were managed from 1924 to 1931 by another legend, Michael Joseph Kelley, one of the great figures of American Association history. Kelley operated the team as club president until 1946. Broadcaster Halsey Hall was the Millers&#x27; play-by-play man from 1933 until the club folded in 1960 to make way for the Minnesota Twins.

Ted Williams, Willie Mays and Carl Yastrzemski were among some future major leaguers who played for the Millers. The Millers won nine pennants in the Association during their fifty-nine years. They played their home games at Nicollet Park until 1955, the ballpark being demolished the following year. That site, at 31st and Nicollet Avenue, is now the home of a Wells Fargo bank. In 1956 they moved into Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, until 1960.

They had a heated crosstown rivalry with the St. Paul Saints. The two clubs often played &quot;streetcar double-headers&quot; on holidays, playing one game in each city.

Over the years the Millers were participants in four Junior World Series; matchups between the champions of the American Association and the International League. In the 1932 championship, the team was defeated by the Newark Bears 4 games to 2. The Millers, under manager Bill Rigney, clinched the 1955 series against the Rochester Red Wings, 4 games to 3, in the final ball game played at Nicollet Park. In 1958, the Millers, with Gene Mauch as skipper, beat the Montreal Royals 4 games to 0. Their last appearance in this Series was in 1959, with Mauch as manager, when the Millers lost the series 4 games to 3 to the Havana Sugar Kings.

After the farm system era began, the Millers were top-level affiliates of the Boston Red Sox (1936–38; 1958–60) and New York Giants (1946–57). It returned to the Red Sox organization as a result of a swap on October 15, 1957 with the San Francisco Seals as part of the Giants&#x27; move to the Bay Area.

The Millers ceased operations after the 1960 season with the arrival of the Minnesota Twins in 1961. The Red Sox affiliated with the Pacific Coast League&#x27;s Seattle Rainiers for 1961. The Millers ended with an overall record of 4,800–4,365. Through the years, Millers pitchers threw seven no-hitters, and a Miller batter was the league-leader in home runs twenty-one times and RBIs nine times.

<text>The hardhead (Aythya australis), also known as the white-eyed duck, is the only true diving duck found in Australia. The common name &quot;hardhead&quot; has nothing to do with the density of the bird&#x27;s skull, instead referring to the difficulty encountered by early taxidermists in processing the head. Hardheads are found in wetter, coastal regions of Australia, particularly in the south-east, but are known to disperse as far afield as New Guinea, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands.

== Description ==
Hardheads are smaller than most ducks, with body length typically between 42 – 59 cm. Both sexes are similar in size, ranging from 525 – 1100 g with wingspans of 65 – 70 cm. Both male and female are a fairly uniform chocolate-brown above, with rufous flanks and white undersides (which are often not visible if the duck is in the water). The trailing edges and almost the entire underside of the wings are white. In the male, the eyes are a striking white, in the female, brown.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Hardheads are common in the south-east of Australia, particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin, but also in the wetter country near the coasts. They are moderately nomadic in normal years, but disperse widely in times of drought. Significant numbers reach as far afield as New Guinea, New Zealand, and the islands of the Pacific, where they can remain for some time, even breeding for a season or two.

Hardheads prefer larger lakes, swamps and rivers with deep, still water, but are often seen in smaller streams, flooded grasslands, and shallow pools. As a general rule, they avoid coastal waters. They rarely come to land and never perch in trees.

Widespread throughout its large range, the hardhead is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

== Behaviour ==
Like the other members of the pochard group, hardheads feed by diving deeply, often staying submerged for as long as a minute at a time. They slip under the water with barely a ripple, simply lowering their heads and thrusting with their powerful webbed feet. They eat a broad range of small aquatic creatures, and supplement this with water weeds.

Hardheads are usually silent, but males have a soft, wheezy whistle and &#x27;whirr&#x27;. Females have a loud rattling &#x27;gaark&#x27; call.

<text>The Long Beach Dub Allstars are an American dub/ska/reggae rock band formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2002, but reformed 10 years later.

==History==
===Initial career (1997–2001)===
Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh met in childhood (in 1979) and later started their first garage punk band, consisting of drums, bass and vocals. In 1988, with Bradley Nowell, they formed the ska punk and reggae rock band Sublime, which went on to sell over 17 million albums worldwide. After Nowell&#x27;s fatal heroin overdose in 1996, Wilson and Gaugh founded the Long Beach Dub Allstars (LBDAS) with RAS-1 from Long Beach reggae band Jah Children on guitar &amp; vocals, who were then joined by frequent Sublime contributors Michael &quot;Miguel&quot; Happoldt, Todd Forman, and &quot;Field&quot; Marshall Goodman.

Eric Wilson said: &quot;We will never replace the greatness that Sublime did or what Bradley has done.&quot; The LBDAS were originally a 10-piece and they recorded their debut recording called &quot;Right Back&quot;, which shortly after completion in 1999 saw the departure of three members. Their second album, &quot;Wonders of the World&quot; was recorded and released in 2001. It featured &quot;Sunny Hours&quot; featuring will.i.am from The Black Eyed Peas. &quot;Sunny Hours&quot; was also used as the theme song for the &quot;Friends&quot; spin-off &quot;Joey&quot;.

===Breakup and aftermath (2002–2012)===
In 2002, rumors that the band had broken up began to surface. Apparently the band had taken a hard-drug-free vow and some of the band&#x27;s members had broken this vow, which caused Bud Gaugh to quit and join Eyes Adrift with Krist Novoselic of Nirvana and Curt Kirkwood of Meat Puppets. Gaugh subsequently played with Kirkwood and Michael Happoldt in the band Volcano. Eric Wilson, Trey Pangborn and RAS-1 formed Long Beach Shortbus with former Slightly Stoopid and temporary Sublime drummer, Kelly Vargas (later replaced by Damion Ramirez). Marshall Goodman, Jack Maness and Opie Ortiz formed Dubcat, with members of Hepcat. Shortbus has had slightly more success than Dubcat, though the latter has yet to release an album. Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh later reunited in Sublime with Rome, a new incarnation of Sublime which chiefly performs songs by that band and features Rome Ramirez in place of Bradley Nowell. However, Gaugh left shortly after their first tour to focus on family and played a few shows with the band Badfish.

===Reunion (2012–present)===
On September 1, 2012, Long Beach Dub Allstars played their first show in 11 years at the Queen Mary Events Park next to the Queen Mary in Long Beach, California, where they opened for The Wailers and played alongside Tribal Seeds. Then on September 30, 2012, Long Beach Dub Allstars performed at the Yost Theater in Santa Ana, California, where they opened for Fishbone.
They played another show at the Brixton Southbay in Redondo Beach, California on January 25, 2013, with the local Redondo Beach Band Special &quot;C&quot;. The reunion lineup consists of Marshall Goodman &quot;Ras MG&quot; on drums, Michael &quot;Miguel&quot; Happoldt on lead guitar/vocals, Opie Ortiz on vocals, Jack Maness on vocals/guitar/keys, Tim Wu on sax/flute/vocals, and Edwin Kampwith on bass.

In 2017, the group toured across California and played one-off shows in Nevada and Florida. They were set to play two shows in San Francisco and Sacramento early in 2018, as well as a gig at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on April 19.

On May 29, 2020, the Long Beach Dub Allstars released their eponymous third studio album under Suburban Noize Records. The self-titled album features 10 tracks with their first single, &quot;Tell Me&quot; along with a music video.

On June 30, 2023, the Long Beach Dub Allstars released their fourth studio album, &quot;Echo Mountain High&quot; on Regime Music Group. It features 13 tracks with their first single, &quot;Let Yourself Shine&quot; that was released on social media and YouTube on April 21. Other singles released with music videos are &quot;Somewhere&quot; and &quot;Preacha&quot; featuring Long Beach local musician Philileano.

<doc id="254428" wikidata="Q380782" url="?curid=254428" title="Commander-in-chief">
<text>A commander-in-chief or supreme commander (supreme commander-in-chief) is the person who exercises supreme command and control over an armed force or a military branch. As a technical term, it refers to military competencies that reside in a country&#x27;s executive leadership, a head of state, head of government, or other designated government official.

While often used interchangeably, the title of Supreme Commander–in–Chief is technically different, since the two titles can be in use simultaneously. For example, in the case of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the &quot;supreme commander-in-chief&quot; is the President of Ukraine, while the &quot;commander-in-chief&quot; is its professional head (note that the word &quot;supreme&quot; is omitted in order to distinguish the two titles.)

==Definition==
The formal role and title of a ruler commanding the armed forces derives from &quot;Imperator&quot; of the Roman Kingdom, Roman Republic and Roman Empire, who possessed &quot;imperium&quot; (command and other regal) powers.

In English use, the term was first used during the English Civil War. A nation&#x27;s head of state (monarchical or republican) usually holds the position of commander-in-chief, even if effective executive power is held by a separate head of government. In a parliamentary system, the executive branch is ultimately dependent upon the will of the legislature; although the legislature does not issue orders directly to the armed forces and therefore does not control the military in any operational sense. Governors-general and colonial governors are also often appointed commander-in-chief of the military forces within their territory.

A commander in chief is sometimes referred to as &quot;supreme commander&quot;, which is sometimes used as a specific term. The term is also used for military officers who hold such power and authority, not always through dictatorship, and as a subordinate (usually) to a head of state (see Generalissimo). The term is also used for officers who hold authority over an individual military branch, special branch or within a theatre of operations.

==Heads of state as commanders in chief==
This includes heads of states who:
* Are chief executives with the political mandate to undertake discretionary decision-making, including command of the armed forces.
* Mostly ceremonial heads of state (constitutional monarchs, viceroys and presidents in parliamentary republics) with residual substantive reserve powers over the armed forces, acting under normal circumstances on the constitutional advice of chief executives with the political mandate to undertake discretionary decision-making.

===Albania===
According to the Constitution of Albania, the president of the Republic of Albania is the commander-in-chief of Albanian Armed Forces.

===Argentina===

Under part II, chapter III, article 99, subsections 12, 13, 14 and 15, the Constitution of Argentina states that the president of the Argentine Nation is the &quot;Commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of the Nation&quot;. It also states that the president is entitled to provide military posts in the granting of the jobs or grades of senior officers of the armed forces, and by itself on the battlefield; runs with its organization and distribution according to needs of the Nation and declares war and orders reprisals with the consent and approval of the Argentine National Congress.

The Ministry of Defense is the government department that assists and serves the president in the management of the armed forces (Army, Navy and Air Force).

===Australia===

Under chapter II of section 68 titled &quot;Command of the naval and military forces&quot;, the Constitution of Australia states that: 

In practice, however, the Governor-General does not play an active part in the Australian Defence Force&#x27;s command structure, and the democratically accountable Australian Cabinet (chaired by the Prime Minister) &quot;de facto&quot; controls the ADF. The Minister for Defence and several subordinate ministers exercise this control through the Australian Defence Organisation. Section 8 of the Defence Act 1903 states:

===Barbados===
According to the Constitution of Barbados, the president of Barbados is the commander-in-chief of Barbados Defense Force. Between 1966 and 2021, prior to the transition to a republican system, the monarch of Barbados, Queen Elizabeth II, was head of the Defense Force, with the Governor-General of Barbados as her viceroy. The president adopted these powers.

===Bangladesh===
First President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was the Supreme Commander of all the Armed Forces of the Republic. In absence of him, then Vice President Syed Nazrul Islam was acting President and acting Supreme Commander of all the Armed Forces of the Republic.

The commander-in-chief of Bangladesh Armed Forces is the president, although executive power and responsibility for national defense resides with the prime minister. This is discharged through the Ministry of Defence, headed by the minister of defence, which provides the policy framework and resources to the Armed Forces to discharge their responsibilities in the context of the defence of the country.

The first commander-in-chief, General M. A. G. Osmani, during Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, who was commander of Muktibahini/Bangladesh Forces, reinstated to active duty by official BD government order, which after independence was gazetted in 1972. He retired on 7 April 1972 and relinquished all authority and duties to the president of Bangladesh.

===Belarus===
The president of Belarus is the Commander-in-Chief of the Belarusian Armed Forces (). The Belarusian commander in chief has an official uniform befitting of the rank, which the president wears on official occasion and ceremonies in relation to the military. The role of commander in chief is laid out in Article 28 of the Constitution of Belarus, which states that he/she has the authority to &quot;appoint and dismiss the high command of the Armed Forces&quot;.

=== Belgium ===
Article 167 of the Constitution of Belgium designates the king as the commander-in-chief. In practice, the Chief of Defence is the head and commander of the Belgian Armed Forces. He reports directly to the Minister of Defence and is responsible for advising the Minister, for the implementation of defence policy and for the administration of the department.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
According to the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the collective Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In peace, the commander-in-chief exercises his command through the minister of defence. In war and in cases where the minister of defence is not fulfilling orders, the commander-in-chief exercises his command directly through the Chief of Joint Staff.

===Brazil===
Article 142 of the Brazilian Constitution of 1988 states that the Brazilian Armed Forces is under the supreme command of the president of the Republic.

===Brunei===
The sultan of Brunei is the commander-in-chief of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces.

=== Canada ===
The powers of command-in-chief over the Canadian Armed Forces are vested in the Canadian monarch, and are delegated to the governor general of Canada, who also uses the title &quot;Commander-in-Chief&quot;. In this capacity, the governor general is entitled to the uniform of a general/flag officer, with the crest of the office and special cuff braid serving as rank insignia.

By constitutional convention, the Crown&#x27;s prerogative powers over the armed forces and constitutional powers as commander-in-chief are exercised on the advice of the prime minister and the rest of Cabinet, the governing ministry that commands the confidence of the House of Commons. According to the National Defence Act, the Minister of National Defence is responsible and accountable to the Parliament of Canada for all matters related to national defence and the Canadian Armed Forces.

===Croatia===
According to the Croatian constitution, the president of Croatia is the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia. There was originally a rank insignia and name for the position, known as &quot;Vrhovnik&quot;. This was held by former President Franjo Tudjman and was abolished after his death. In peace, the commander-in-chief exercises his command through the minister of defence. In war and in cases where the minister of defence is not fulfilling orders, the commander-in-chief exercises his command directly through the chief of General Staff.

===Czechia===
According to the 1992 constitution, the president of the Czech Republic is the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces according to Article 63(1)(c), and appoints and promotes generals under Article 63(1)(f). The president needs the countersignature of the prime minister for decisions concerning the above-mentioned provisions as per Articles 63(3–4), or otherwise, they are not valid. The prime minister may delegate to other ministers the right to countersign these decisions of the president. The political responsibility for the Armed Forces is borne by the Government, which in Article 67 is defined as the &quot;supreme body of executive power&quot;. According to Articles 39 &amp; 43, the Parliament must give consent to the dispatch of Czech military forces outside the territory of the Czech Republic.

The Ministry of Defence is the central authority of the state administration for the control of the Armed Forces. The actual day-to-day management is vested in the chief of the general staff, the Czech chief of defence equivalent.

===Denmark===

The position of the Danish monarch as the head of the military is deeply rooted in tradition. While the 1953 constitution does not explicitly designate the monarch as commander-in-chief; it is implicit, given the general provision in article 12 and the more specific wording of article 19 (2): &quot;Except for purposes of defence against an armed attack upon the Realm or Danish forces, the King shall not use military force against any foreign state without the consent of the Folketing. Any measure which the King may take in pursuance of this provision shall forthwith be submitted to the Folketing&quot;.

However, when reading the Danish Constitution, it is important to bear in mind that the k&quot;ing&quot; in this context is understood by Danish jurists to be read as the &quot;government&quot; (consisting of the prime minister and other ministers). This is a logical consequence of articles 12, 13 and 14, all of which in essence stipulates that the powers vested in the monarch can only be exercised through ministers, who are responsible for all acts. Thus, the Government, in effect, holds the supreme command authority implied in articles 12 and 19(2).

The Danish Defence Law () designates in article 9 the minister of defence as the supreme authority in Defence (). Under the minister is the chief of defence, the senior-ranking professional military officer heading the Defence Command, who commands the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and other units not reporting directly to the Ministry of Defence.

===Dominican Republic===
According to the Constitution, Article 128, Section II, Title IV, the president is the head of foreign policy, the civil administration and the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, the National Police and all other state&#x27;s security agencies.

===Egypt===
In Egypt, the president of the Republic holds the ceremonial title of Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. A member of the government, usually defence minister, is commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces. The president is the only individual capable of declaring war. With the exception of Mohamed Morsi, who briefly served as president from 2012 to 2013, all Egyptian presidents have been former military officers. During the Yom Kippur War, the president played a major role at all levels of the planning of the war, and was, in a literal sense, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, giving direct orders to the commanders from the headquarters during the war as field marshal of the army, marshal of the air force and air defence forces and admiral of the navy.

===Eswatini===
The king of Eswatini is the commander in chief of the Umbutfo Eswatini Defence Force.

===Ethiopia===
The president of Ethiopia is the Supreme Commander of the Ethiopian Armed Forces which is the ceremonial role that is limited to granting high military titles and awards. The prime minister of Ethiopia is the commander-in-chief of the Ethiopian National Defense Force.

===Finland===

According to the Finnish constitution, the president of Finland is the commander-in-chief of all Finnish military forces. In practice, the everyday command and control is in the hands of the chief of defence and the commander of the Finnish Border Guard. The economic administration of the Finnish Defence Force is the responsibility of Ministry of Defence. The duty of the president is to decide upon
* main principles of the military defence of the realm
* principles of the execution of the military defence
* other military command matters with wide-ranging importance to the military activity or the military establishment
* any other military command issue that he wishes to decide upon

Since the constitutional reform of 2000, the minister of defence has the right to be present when the president uses his command powers, unless the matter is of immediate concern. In questions of strategic importance, the prime minister has the same right.

The president commissions and promotes officers and decides on activating reservists for extraordinary service and on the mobilisation of the Defence Forces. If Parliament is not in session when a decision to mobilise is taken, it must be immediately convened. Declarations of a state of emergency (, literally, &quot;state of preparedness&quot;) and state of war (, lit. &quot;state of defence&quot;) are declared by a presidential decree, given after a motion by the government, which is then submitted to the Parliament for ratification.

The president has, in a state of emergency, the right to transfer the position of the commander-in-chief to another Finnish citizen.

===France===

In France, the president of the Republic is designated as &quot;Chef des Armées&quot; (literally &quot;Chief of the Armies&quot;) under article 15 of the Constitution; the officeholder is as such the supreme executive authority in military affairs. Article 16 provides the president with extensive emergency powers.

However, owing to the nature of the semi-presidential system, the prime minister also has key constitutional powers under article 21: &quot;He shall be responsible for national defence&quot; and has &quot;power to make regulations and shall make appointments to civil and military posts&quot;.

====Pre-1958====
Since the reign of Louis XIV, France has been strongly centralised. After crushing local nobles engaged in warlord-ism, the kings of France retained all authority with the help of able yet discreet Prime ministers (Mazarin, Richelieu).

The French Revolution transferred the supreme authority to the King (in the context of the short-lived constitutional monarchy), then to the multi-member &quot;Comité de Salut Public&quot; during the &quot;Convention&quot;, as well as later to the &quot;Directoire&quot;, before being regained in the hands of Consul Napoléon Bonaparte, later Emperor Napoléon I, alone.

The &quot;Restoration&quot; restored the authority of the King, first in an absolute monarchy, then the constitutional July Monarchy of Louis Philippe, before it was overthrown in turn by the Second Republic and later the Second Empire of Napoleon III.

The following Third Republic was a parliamentary system, where the military authority was held by the president of the Council of Ministers, head of government, although the president, head of state, retained ceremonial powers. During World War I, the many visits to the trenches by the elder statesman Georges Clemenceau impressed the soldiers and earned him the nickname &quot;Father of Victory&quot; ().

During World War II, &quot;Maréchal&quot; Philippe Pétain assumed power and held the supreme authority in Vichy France, while Général Charles de Gaulle, acting on behalf of the previous regime, founded the Free French Forces, upon which he held supreme authority all through the war.

The following and short-lived Fourth Republic was a parliamentary system, which was replaced by the present Fifth Republic, a semi-presidential system.

As commander in chief, the president has the power to declare war however they must subject to the approval of the Parliament of India. The commander in chief also appoints the chiefs of each branch of the armed forces as well as the Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee with the advice of the Minister of Defence.

Whilst the constitution names the president as the &quot;de jure&quot; commander in chief, executive command authority is exercised &quot;de facto&quot; by the prime minister and their Union Council of Ministers.

On 15 August 1947, each service was placed under its own commander-in-chief. In 1955, the three service chiefs were re-designated as the chief of the Army staff (rank of general), the chief of the naval staff (rank of vice admiral) and the chief of the air staff (rank of air marshal) with the president as the supreme commander. The chief of the air staff was raised to the rank of air chief marshal in 1965 and the chief of the naval staff raised to the rank of admiral in 1968. Starting from 1 January 2020, all the three chiefs of staff report to the newly formed chief of defence staff.

The chief of staff is also appointed by the president from senior military officers. The president as commander-in-chief also has authority in senior military officer mutation and promotion in tour of duty. The minister of defense has responsibility to assist the president in defense issues and create policies about authorization use of military force, manage defense budget, etc. According to article 11 of the Constitution, For authorization use of military forces or declaration of war, the president must get approval from House of Representatives.

It was after this event that the role of commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran was given to the Supreme Leader of Iran.

===Ireland===
The supreme commander of the Defence Forces is the president of Ireland, but in practice the minister for defence acts on the president&#x27;s behalf and reports to the Government of Ireland.

As such, he is the highest-ranking officer in the military establishment, with the power to appoint the Chief of Staff (on the advice of the Armed Forces Council). He also appoints the service heads of each of the three branches of the military.

The Federal Constitution establishes that the office of Supreme Commander is attached to the person of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong as the Federation&#x27;s head of state:
* Federal Constitution, Article 41 - The Yang di-Pertuan Agong shall be the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the Federation.
The Federal Parliament passed the Federal Armed Forces Act to consolidate in one law all regulations that govern the three services ( Army, Navy, and Air Force ). It establishes the function and duties of the Federal Head of State in the capacity as Supreme Commander.

===Mexico===
Section VI of Article 89 of the Constitution states that the president of the United Mexican States shall &quot;Preserve national security, in accordance with the respective law, and dispose of the full permanent Armed Force, that is to say the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, for the interior security and exterior defense of the Federation&quot;.

Both the Organic Law of the Mexican Army and Air Force and the Organic Law of the Mexican Navy clearly state the president of the Republic is &quot;Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces&quot;. The President is &quot;ex officio&quot; the only five-star general of Mexico.

The Constitution also grants the president freedom to appoint and remove the secretary of the Navy and the secretary of national defense.

===New Zealand===

Both the Monarch of New Zealand and their representative, the governor-general, constitutionally serve as the supreme authority in defence matters in New Zealand. The position of commander-in-chief is vested in the sovereign by the constitution. In practice however, the position of the commander-in-chief is largely ceremonial, with the governor-general primarily serving as a &quot;patron of the New Zealand Defence Force&quot;. The governor-general exercises their authority as commander-in-chief on the advice of the minister of defence or other ministers of the New Zealand Government.

The Letter Patents 1983 consolidated the roles of governor-general and commander-in-chief into one office, with its compounded title being the &quot;Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief&quot;. The governor-general&#x27;s is statutorily defined in the &quot;Defence Act 1990&quot;. Sections five and six of the &quot;Defence Act 1990&quot; outlines the governor-general&#x27;s authority to raise and maintain armed forces.

===Nigeria===

=== Norway ===
Harald V, King of Norway, officially retains executive power. Article 25 of the constitution states: &quot;The King is commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the realm&quot;

However, following the introduction of a parliamentary system of government, the duties of the monarch have since become strictly representative and ceremonial, such as the formal appointment and dismissal of the prime minister and other ministers in the executive government. Accordingly, the Monarch is commander-in-chief of the Norwegian Armed Forces, and serves as chief diplomatic official abroad and as a symbol of unity.

===Pakistan===

In Pakistan, before the 1973 Constitution, the head of the army, was known as the Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army, heads of the navy and the air force were also titled as &quot;Commander-in-Chief&quot;. The head of army term was replaced to &quot;Chief of Army Staff&quot; on 20 March 1972 during military reforms The chief of staff is a four-star officer whose term is 3 years, but can be extended or renewed once.

===Poland===
The president of Poland is the supreme commander () of the Polish Armed Forces according to the Constitution and in times of peace exercises their authority through Minister of National Defence. However, the art. 134 ust. 4 of the constitution states: 

During the interbellum period, the General Inspector of the Armed Forces was appointed the commander-in-chief for the time of war (Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces). However, after the war this function ceased to exist—thus it is likely that if Poland formally participates in a war, the chief of the general staff of the Polish Armed Forces will be appointed supreme commander.

===Portugal===
The president of the Portuguese Republic is the constitutional supreme commander of the Armed Forces (in Portuguese: &quot;Comandante Supremo das Forças Armadas&quot;). However, the operational command is delegated in the chief of the general staff of the Armed Forces.

In the Portuguese military parlance, the term &quot;Commander-in-Chief&quot; (in Portuguese: &quot;comandante-em-chefe&quot; or simply &quot;comandante-chefe&quot;) refers to the unified military commander of all the land, naval and air forces in a theater of operations.

===Russia===

=== South Africa ===
Chapter 11, section 202(1) of the Constitution of South Africa states that the president of South Africa is the commander-in-chief of the South African National Defence Force. The constitution places conditions on when and how that power may be employed and requires regular reports to the Parliament of South Africa.

===South Korea===

In accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, the commander-in-chief and the supreme authority on all military matters is the president of South Korea.

===Spain===

As with most remaining European monarchies, the position of the Spanish monarch as the nominal head of the armed forces is deeply rooted in tradition.

The Spanish Constitution of 1978 authorizes the King in article 62 (h): 

The king regularly chairs sessions of the National Security Council, the Joint Chiefs of staff and the individual general staffs of each branch of the Armed Forces in his capacity as supreme commander.

All promotions to military rank and positions in the high command of the armed forces are made by Royal decree signed by the king and the minister of defense

However, article 64 require that all official acts of the King must be countersigned, by the President of the Government or other competent minister, for them to become valid. This counter/signature is used to limit a possible abuse of power by any single individual.

This constitutional provision can and has been made the subject of an exception in crisis situations.

In 1981 the king as supreme commander of the armed forces assumed direct command in order to put down a military coup attempt. All members of the government were at that time trapped/held hostage in Parliament and were unable to counter sign the kings orders. This did not however result in those orders being ruled unenforceable or unconstitutional. The coup collapsed after the king ordered all army units to leave the streets and return to their barracks. Furthermore, article 97 stipulates that; 

No provision in the constitution requires the king/government to seek approval from the Cortes Generales before sending the armed forces abroad.

Since 1984, the chief of the defence staff is the professional head of the armed forces and, under the authority of the minister of defence, is responsible for military operations and military organisation.

===Sri Lanka===
As head of state, the president of Sri Lanka, is nominally the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The National Security Council, chaired by the president is the authority charged with formulating and executing defence policy for the nation. The highest level of military headquarters is the Ministry of Defence, since 1978 except for a few rare occasions the president retained the portfolio defence, thus being the minister of defence. The ministry and the armed forces have been controlled by the during these periods by either a minister of state, deputy minister for defence, and of recently the permanent secretary to the Ministry of Defence. Prior to 1978 the prime minister held the portfolio of minister of defence and external affairs, and was supported by a parliamentary secretary for defence and external affairs.

Responsibility for the management of the forces is Ministry of Defence, while the planning and execution of combined operations is the responsibility of the Joint Operations Command (JOC). The JOC is headed by the chief of the defence staff who is the most senior officer in the Armed Forces and is an appointment that can be held by an air chief marshal, admiral, or general. The three services have their own respective professional chiefs: the commander of the Army, the commander of the Navy and the commander of the Air Force, who have much autonomy.

===Suriname===
In Suriname, the constitution gives the president &quot;supreme authority over the armed forces and all of its members&quot;.

With all these issues above written in the Constitution of Turkey, the executive rights are given to the president of the Republic of Turkey to be represented as the commander-in-chief of the nation.

===Ukraine===
While the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is the highest-ranking military officer (i.e. the chief of defence), the president of Ukraine is the constitutional .

===United Kingdom===

The British monarch is the &quot;Head of the British Armed Forces&quot; and has also been described as &quot;Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces&quot;. The prime minister (acting with the support of the Cabinet) makes the key decisions on the &quot;use&quot; of the armed forces. The King, however, remains the ceremonial &quot;ultimate authority&quot; of the military, with officers and personnel swearing allegiance only to the monarch.

The term is also used for the military commander-in-chief of a &quot;command&quot; (a region of military authority, sometimes combined with the civil office of Governor of a colony (now called a British Overseas Territory)), and for the naval commander-in-chief of a &quot;station&quot; of the Royal Navy, such as the North America and West Indies Station.

===United States===
According to Article II, Section 2, Clause I of the Constitution, the president of the United States is &quot;Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States.&quot; There have been 45 presidents of the United States (counting Grover Cleveland and Donald Trump once), but there have been 47 commanders-in-chief of the United States due to the fact that Dick Cheney and Kamala Harris each temporarily held the position of acting president under the Twenty-fifth Amendment. (George H. W. Bush was also temporarily acting president but later was elected president.) Since the National Security Act of 1947, the commander-in-chief provision has been understood to mean all United States Armed Forces. U.S. ranks have their roots in British military traditions, with the president possessing ultimate authority, but no rank, maintaining a civilian status.
The exact degree of authority that the Constitution grants to the president as commander-in-chief has been the subject of much debate throughout history, with Congress at various times granting the president wide authority and at others attempting to restrict that authority.

====U.S. States====
In U.S. States, the governor also serves as the commander-in-chief of the National Guard, State Militia, and State Defense Forces. In the Commonwealth of Kentucky, for example, KRS 37.180 states:

Similarly, Section 140 of Article 2 of the California Military and Veterans Code states:

===Uzbekistan===
The Uzbek president holds the constitutional position of Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of Uzbekistan, according to the Constitution of Uzbekistan. In this capacity, the president give decisions on declaring war or martial law, the appointment of senior officials, and the development of the armed forces. In the event of an attack on the republic, the president announce a state of war and will submit within 72 hours a resolution for a plan of action to the Oliy Majlis. When the country is in a wartime situation, the minister of defense will serve in an official capacity as the deputy supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces, essentially assisting the president in his day-to-day activities and decisions regarding national security.

===Venezuela===

According to the Venezuelan constitution, the president is the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces. The office of the Venezuelan military supreme commander in chief has always been held by the president of Venezuela as per constitutional requirements. However, with a new law sanctioned in 2008, the &quot;comandante en jefe&quot; rank is not only a function attributed to the executive branch but a full military rank given to the president upon taking office. Upon assumption he receives a saber, epaulette, shoulder knot, shoulder board and sleeve insignia and full military uniform to be used in military events while performing the duties as president. The shoulder insignia mirrors Cuban practice but is derived from the German-styled officer rank insignia.

===Vietnam===
The commander-in-chief of the armed forces is the president of Vietnam, through his post as chairman of National Defense and Security Council. Though this position is nominal and real power is assumed by the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of Vietnam. The secretary of Central Military Commission (general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam &quot;ex officio&quot;) is the &quot;de facto&quot; commander-in-chief.

The minister of Defence oversees operations of the Ministry of Defence, and the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army. He also oversees such agencies as the General Staff and the General Logistics Department. However, military policy is ultimately directed by the Central Military Commission of the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam.

==Other officeholders as commanders-in-chief or other situations==

===Armenia===
The prime minister of Armenia holds the title of Supreme Commander in Chief of the Armenian Armed Forces (). The hereditary title and rank of &quot;Sparapet&quot;&#x27; () was a used to describe the supreme commander of the military forces of ancient and medieval Armenia. Since its introduction in the 2nd century BC, it is often used today to describe famous and high-ranking military officials. Notable Armenians to have held the title include Garegin Nzhdeh, the supreme commander of the Republic of Mountainous Armenia. and Vazgen Sargsyan, the two-time defense minister of Armenia and prime minister in the 1990s.

===China===
Article 93 of the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China states the authority to direct the armed forces is invested to the Central Military Commission of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The same article also states that the chairman of the Central Military Commission assumes overall responsibility for the work of the Central Military Commission and that it is responsible to the National People&#x27;s Congress and its Standing Committee. There is also the Central Military Commission of the Chinese Communist Party under the authority of the Party Central Committee. In practice, both commissions have identitical membership, except for a brief period between the Party Congress and the National People&#x27;s Congress, and are practically the same institutution under the system of &quot;one institution, two names&quot;.

Furthermore, Article 80 gives the president of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (in addition to ceremonial head of state duties) the power to proclaim martial law, proclaim a state of war, and to issue mobilisation orders upon the decision of National People&#x27;s Congress and its Standing Committee.

The state president and the CMC chairman are distinctly separate state offices and they have not always been held by the same persons. However, beginning in 1993, during the tenure of Jiang Zemin as General Secretary of the Communist Party and CMC chairman, it has been standard practice to have the offices of the CCP general secretary, president, and the CMC chairman to be normally held by the same person; although the slight differences in the start and end of terms for those respective offices means that there is some overlap between an occupant and his predecessor.

====Hong Kong====
When Hong Kong was under British authority, the civilian governor was the &quot;ex officio&quot; commander-in-chief of the British Forces Overseas Hong Kong. After the territory&#x27;s handover to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1997, the commanders of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison are PLA personnel from mainland China and commanded by the CMC.

===Ethiopia===
The 1995 Constitution designates the prime minister of Ethiopia as &quot;Commander-in-Chief of the national armed forces&quot; in Article 74(1).

===Germany===
; Federal Republic of Germany (1956–present)
Upon the re-militarization of West Germany in 1955, when it joined NATO, the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany was amended in 1956 to include constitutional provisions for the command of the armed forces.
* In peacetime, under Article 65a, the federal minister of defence () holds the supreme command authority () over the .
* If the Bundestag declares the state of defence (), the Federal Chancellor, under Article 115b, assumes the command authority over the armed forces. , this has never happened.
* The president of Germany has thus no role in the command of the forces, although he continues to receive the ceremonial honors due to his position as a head of state.
Placing the command authority over the armed forces directly with the responsible minister in charge of the military establishment breaks with the longstanding German constitutional tradition in both earlier monarchical and republican systems of placing it with the head of state. The rationale was that in a democratic parliamentary system the command authority should directly reside where it would be exercised and where it is subject to the parliamentary control of the Bundestag at all times. By assigning it directly to the responsible minister, instead of with the Federal Chancellor, this also meant that military affairs is but one of the many integrated responsibilities of the government; in stark contrast of earlier times when the separate division of the military establishment from the civil administration allowed the former to act as a state within a state (in contrast to the Federal Republic, the Weimar Republic began with the Ebert–Groener pact, which kept the military establishment as an autonomous force outside the control of politics; the 1925 election of Paul von Hindenburg as &quot;Reichspräsident&quot;, surrounded by his camarilla and the machinations of Kurt von Schleicher, did little to reverse the trend).

; East Germany (1960–1990)
The legislature of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the &quot;Volkskammer&quot;, enacted on 13 February 1960 the &quot;Law on the Formation of the National Defense Council of the GDR&quot;, which established a council consisting of a chairman and at least 12 members. This was later incorporated into the GDR Constitution in April 1968. The National Defense Council held the supreme command of the National People&#x27;s Army (including the internal security forces), and the council&#x27;s chairman (usually the General Secretary of the ruling Socialist Unity Party) was considered the GDR&#x27;s commander-in-chief.

The GDR joined with the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990, upon which the GDR&#x27;s constitution and armed forces were abolished.

; German Reich (1871–1945)
During the Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire, Weimar Republic and the Nazi era, whoever was the head of state—the king of Prussia/German emperor (under the Constitution of the Kingdom of Prussia/Constitution of the German Empire) to 1918, the Reichspräsident (under the Weimar Constitution) to 1934, and the Führer from 1934 to 1945—was the head of the Armed Forces (: literally &quot;Possessor of highest command&quot;).

Below the level of the head of state, each military branch () had its own head who reported directly to the head of state and held the highest rank in his service; in the Reichsheer - , and in the Reichsmarine - Grossadmiral.

After Chancellor Adolf Hitler assumed power as &quot;Führer&quot; (after the death of President Paul von Hindenburg), he would later grant his war minister, Werner von Blomberg, the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces in 1935, when conscription was reintroduced. However, in 1938 due to the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair, Hitler withdrew the commander-in-chief title, abolished the war ministerial post and assumed personal command of the Armed Forces. The war ministerial post was de facto overtaken by the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot;, which was headed by Wilhelm Keitel until the German surrender.

===Greece===
According to Article 45 of the Greek Constitution, the president is the head of the Greek Armed Forces, but their administration is exercised by the government. The prime minister, the minister for national defence and the chief of the general staff are the ones who command the Armed Forces.

===Iraq===
In pre-war Iraq, the commander-in-chief was the head of state, i.e. the president. In the current constitution, the commander-in-chief of the Iraqi Armed Forces is the prime minister, and the president only retains a ceremonial and honorary role of awarding medals and decorations on the recommendation of the commander-in-chief.

===Israel===
In Israel, the applicable basic law states that the ultimate authority over the Israel Defense Forces rests with the Government of Israel (chaired by the prime minister) as a collective body. The authority of the government is exercised by the minister of defense on behalf of the Government. However, the commander-in-chief of the IDF is the chief of general staff who, despite being subordinate to the minister of defense, holds the highest level of command within the military.

===Japan===
In Japan, prior to the Meiji Restoration the role of the commander-in-chief was vested in the &quot;shōgun&quot; (the most militarily powerful samurai &quot;daimyō&quot;). After the dissolution of the Tokugawa shogunate, the role of the commander-in-chief resided with the Emperor of Japan. The present-day constitutional role of the emperor is that of a ceremonial figurehead (Japanese Constitution calls it symbol) without any military role.

After Japan&#x27;s move towards democracy, the position of commander-in-chief of the Japan Self-Defense Forces is held by the prime minister of Japan. Military authority runs from the prime minister to the cabinet-level minister of defense of the Japanese Ministry of Defense.

===Malta===
The Malta Armed Forces Act does not directly establish the president of Malta as the supreme commander of the Armed Forces. However, Maltese law allows the president to raise by voluntary enlistment and maintain an armed force. Likewise, the law allows the president to issue orders in order to the administrate the armed forces.

The Armed Forces do not swear allegiance to the president of Malta, but rather to the Republic of Malta. On this basis, there is no direct link between the head of state and the armed forces. For this reason, this link is mediated by the minister responsible for defence.

Nonetheless, the Presidential Palaces are guarded by the Armed Forces as a symbolic gesture of social cohesion.

===Myanmar===

In Myanmar, the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services (Tatmadaw) is the commanding officer national military, a position vested in a military officer, not the president. The commander-in-chief is, however, a member of the National Defence and Security Council and reports to the president. The commander-in-chief is assisted in his/her role by the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services.

===Netherlands===

The Constitution of the Netherlands states, in article 97, that &quot;the Government shall have supreme authority over the armed forces&quot;. Article 42 defines the Government as the Monarch and the ministers, and that only ministers are responsible for acts of government. Article 45 further defines the ministers as constituting the Cabinet, chaired by the prime minister, with &quot;authority to decide upon overall government policy&quot;.

Before the constitution change in 1983, the equivalent section stated that: &quot;The King shall have supreme authority over the armed forces&quot;. Nevertheless, the role of the monarch as commander in chief was ceremonial as in most European constitutional monarchies. As a consequence of being only part of the government, monarchs of the Netherlands do not hold a military rank. The current king of the Netherlands Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands resigned from his military ranks (equivalent to one-star general in all branches) upon becoming king in 2013. He has been provided with royal insignia to show his lasting commitment to the armed forces, but these represent no formal rank.

The minister of defence has the primary ministerial responsibility for the armed forces, which are formally a part of the Ministry of Defence. The chief of defence is the highest ranked professional military officer, and serves as an intermediary between the minister of defence and the Armed Forces, and is responsible to the minister for military-strategic planning, operations and deployment of the Armed Forces.

===North Korea===

Article 47 of the Rules of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea stipulates that the Korean People&#x27;s Army is &quot;Revolutionary Armed Forces of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea&quot; and &quot;Korean People&#x27;s Army conducts all military and political activities under the leadership of the Party.&quot; Article 30 invests commanding authority to the Party Central Military Commission, whose &quot;ex officio&quot; chair is the General Secretary of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea.

Article 103 of the Constitution of North Korea designates the President of the State Affairs Commission, as the country&#x27;s head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

Currently both offices are occupied by Kim Jong Un. Since 2018, he started issuing orders in the name of the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, instead of the Supreme Commander.

===Sweden===

In Sweden, with the Ordinance of Alsnö in 1280, nobles were exempted from land taxation if they provided cavalrymen to the king&#x27;s service. Following the Swedish War of Liberation (1521–23) from the Kalmar Union, a Guards Regiment was formed under the King and from there the modern Swedish Army has its roots. During the age of the Swedish Empire, several kings—Gustavus Adolphus the Great, Charles X Gustav, Charles XI &amp; Charles XII—personally led their forces into battle. Under the Instrument of Government of 1809, which was in force until the current Instrument of Government of 1974 went into force on 1 January 1975; the monarch was in §§ 14-15 explicitly designated as the commander-in-chief of the Swedish Armed Forces ().

At present, the Government () as a collective body, chaired and formed by the prime minister of Sweden, holds the highest Executive Authority, subject to the will of the Riksdag; and is thus the present day closest equivalent of a command-in-chief, although not explicitly designated as such. The reason for this change was, apart from the fact that the king was since 1917 no longer expected to make political decisions without ministerial advice, that the new Instrument of Government was intended to be made as descriptive on the workings of the State as possible, and reflective on how decisions are actually made. Minister of Justice Lennart Geijer further remarked in the government bill that any continued pretensions of royal involvement in government decisions would be of a &quot;fictitious nature&quot; and &quot;highly unsatisfactory&quot;.

Certain government decisions regarding the Armed Forces () may be delegated to the minister for defence, under the supervision of the prime minister and to the extent laid down in ordinances.

To add to some confusion to the above, the title of the agency head of the Swedish Armed Forces and highest ranked commissioned officer on active duty, is actually the supreme commander of the Swedish Armed Forces ().

However, the Monarch (as of present King Carl XVI Gustaf), is still a four-star general and admiral &quot;à la suite&quot; in the Swedish Army, Navy and Air Force and is by unwritten convention regarded as the foremost head and representative of the Swedish Armed Forces. The king has, as part of his court, a military staff. The military staff is headed by a senior officer (usually a general or admiral, retired from active service) and is composed of active duty military officers serving as aides to the king and his family.

===Switzerland===
Supreme authority over the military belongs to the Federal Council, which is the Swiss collegial head of state. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, under the Constitution, the Federal Council can only, in the operational sense, command a maximum of 4,000 soldiers, with a time limit of three weeks of mobilisation. For it to field more service personnel, the Federal Assembly must elect a General who is given four stars. Thus, the General is elected by the Federal Assembly to give him the same democratic legitimacy as the Federal Council.

In peacetime, the Armed Forces are led by the Chief of the Armed Forces (&quot;Chef der Armee&quot;), who reports to the head of the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports and to the Federal Council as a whole. The Chief of the Armed Forces has the rank of &quot;Korpskommandant&quot; or &quot;Commandant de corps&quot; (OF-8 in NATO equivalence).

In a time of declared war or national emergency, however, the Federal Assembly, assembled as the United Federal Assembly, specifically for the purpose of taking on the war-time responsibilities elect a General as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces under Article 168 of the Constitution. Whilst the General acts as the highest military authority with a high degree of autonomy, he is still subordinate to the Federal Council (See Articles 58, 60, 174, 177, 180 &amp; 185). The Federal Assembly retains the sole power to dismiss the General, but the General remains subordinate to the Federal Council by the council&#x27;s ability to demobilise, thereby making the position of General redundant.

Four generals were appointed in Swiss history, General Henri Dufour during the Swiss Civil War, General Hans Herzog during the Franco-Prussian War, General Ulrich Wille during the First World War, and General Henri Guisan during the Second World War (&quot;la Mob&quot;, &quot;the Mobilisation&quot;). Although Switzerland remained neutral during the latter three conflicts, the threat of having its territory used as a battlefield by the much bigger war parties of Germany and France required mobilization of the army.

Within NATO and the European Union, the term Chief of Defence (CHOD) is usually used as a generic term for the highest-ranked office held by a professional military officer on active duty, irrespective of their actual title or powers.

<text>Seán MacBride (26 January 1904 – 15 January 1988) was an Irish Clann na Poblachta politician who served as Minister for External Affairs from 1948 to 1951, Leader of Clann na Poblachta from 1946 to 1965 and Chief of Staff of the IRA from 1936 to 1937. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1947 to 1957.

Rising from a domestic Irish political career, he founded or participated in multiple international organisations of the 20th century, including the United Nations, the Council of Europe and Amnesty International. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1974, the Lenin Peace Prize for 1975–1976 and the UNESCO Silver Medal for Service in 1980.

==Early life==
MacBride was born in Paris in 1904, the son of Maud Gonne and Major John MacBride. As a founding member of Inghinidhe na hÉireann and Cumann na mBan, his mother was to become a prominent figure in Irish nationalist and republican circles. Later, in the thirties, she became a devotee of the social credit ideas of Major C.H. Douglas and was &quot;noisily anti-Semitic&quot;. His father had led the Irish Transvaal Brigade against the British in the Second Boer War. Within a year of MacBride&#x27;s birth, he returned to Dublin where, following his participation in the Easter Rising, John MacBride was court-martialed by the British and executed in May 1916.

MacBride&#x27;s first language was French, and he retained, or, as some would claim, affected, a French accent in the English language for the rest of his life. MacBride first studied at the Jesuit Lycée Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague, and remained in Paris until his father&#x27;s execution by the British for his involvement in the 1916 Easter Rising, when he was sent to school at Mount St Benedict&#x27;s, Gorey, County Wexford in Ireland, and briefly at the Downside School.

MacBride first became involved in politics during the 1918 Irish general election in which he was active for Sinn Féin. The following year in 1919, aged 15, he lied about his age to join the Irish Volunteers, which fought as part of the Irish Republican Army, and took part in the Irish War of Independence. He opposed the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty and was imprisoned by the Irish Free State during the Irish Civil War.

== Anti-Treaty IRA, cooperation with the Soviets ==
On his release in 1924, MacBride studied law at University College Dublin and resumed his IRA activities. He worked briefly for Éamon de Valera as his personal secretary, travelling with him to Rome to meet various dignitaries.

In January 1925, on his twenty-first birthday, MacBride married Catalina &quot;Kid&quot; Bulfin, a woman four years his senior who shared his political views. Bulfin was the daughter of the Irish nationalist publisher and travel-writer William Bulfin.

Before returning to Dublin in 1927, where he became the IRA&#x27;s Director of Intelligence, MacBride worked as a journalist in Paris and London.

According to historians Tom Mahon and James J. Gillogly, recently deciphered IRA messages from the 1920s reveal that the organisation&#x27;s two main sources of funding were Clan na Gael and the Soviet Union. The messages further reveal that MacBride, before becoming IRA Director of Intelligence, was involved in the espionage activities in Great Britain of GRU spymaster Walter Krivitsky, whom ciphered IRA communications referred to only by the code name &quot;James&quot;.

In addition to supplying the USSR with detailed information on Royal Navy ships and Royal Air Force aeroplane engines, MacBride provided Soviet agents with &quot;a brief specification and a complete drawing&quot; of ASDIC, an early sonar system for detecting submarines, at a covert meeting in Amsterdam during the autumn of 1926. MacBride also assisted the GRU by providing forged passports to Soviet intelligence operatives who were at risk of capture.

In October 1926, MacBride sent a ciphered report from Paris to his IRA superiors about Soviet counterfeiting operations, saying, &quot;Several bad Bank of England notes have been passed here lately. These are said to emanate from Russia.&quot;

Soon after his return to Dublin in 1927, he was arrested and charged with the murder of politician Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, who had been assassinated near his home in Booterstown, County Dublin. At his trial, however, Cumann na nGaedheal politician Bryan Cooper testified as a witness for the defence that, at the time of Kevin O&#x27;Higgins&#x27; murder, both he and MacBride had been aboard a ferry travelling from Britain to Ireland. MacBride was then charged with being a subversive and interned in Mountjoy Prison.

In September 1927, Krivitsky sent the IRA a message from Amsterdam, demanding to see MacBride immediately, claiming to have a &quot;present&quot; he was anxious to give away, and naming a cafe where the meeting could take place. As MacBride was then imprisoned in Dublin, the IRA&#x27;s chief of staff, Moss Twomey, replied that the request was &quot;rather awkward and impossible to fulfill at the present&quot;. In response, Twomey and two other senior IRA members travelled to Amsterdam and met with Krivitsky instead.

In 1929 an Irish section of the League Against Imperialism was formed and MacBride served as its secretary. Aimed at creating a &quot;mass anti-imperialist movement&quot;, the organization was founded with the support of the Comintern.

Towards the end of the 1920s, after many supporters had left to join Fianna Fáil, some members of the IRA started pushing for a more left-wing agenda. After the IRA Army Council voted down the idea, MacBride launched a new movement, Saor Éire (&quot;Free Ireland&quot;), in 1931. Although it was a non-military organisation, Saor Éire was declared unlawful along with the IRA, Cumann na mBan and nine other bodies. MacBride, meanwhile, became the security services&#x27; number-one target.

In 1936, the IRA&#x27;s chief of staff Moss Twomey was sent to prison for three years; he was replaced by MacBride. At the time, the movement was in a state of disarray, with conflicts between several factions and personalities. Tom Barry was appointed chief of staff to head up a military operation against the British, an action with which MacBride did not agree.

In 1937, MacBride was called to the bar. He then resigned from the IRA when the Constitution of Ireland was enacted later that year. As a barrister, MacBride frequently defended IRA prisoners of the state (Thomas Hart &amp; Patrick McGrath). MacBride was unsuccessful in preventing the 1944 death by hanging of Charlie Kerins, who had been convicted based on fingerprint evidence of the 1942 ambush and murder of Garda Detective Sergeant Denis O&#x27;Brien. In 1946, during the inquest into the death of Seán McCaughey, MacBride embarrassed the Irish State by forcing them to admit that conditions in Portlaoise Prison were inhumane.

==Clann na Poblachta, Minister for External Affairs==
In 1946, MacBride founded the republican/socialist party Clann na Poblachta. He hoped it would replace Fianna Fáil as Ireland&#x27;s major political party. In October 1947, he won a seat in Dáil Éireann at a by-election in the Dublin County constituency. On the same day, Patrick Kinane also won the Tipperary by-election for Clann na Poblachta.

However, at the 1948 general election Clann na Poblachta won only ten seats. The party joined with Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the National Labour Party, Clann na Talmhan and several independents to form the First Inter-Party Government with Fine Gael TD John A. Costello as Taoiseach. Richard Mulcahy was the Leader of Fine Gael, but MacBride and many other Irish Republicans had never forgiven Mulcahy for his role in carrying out 77 executions under the government of the Irish Free State in the 1920s during the Irish Civil War. To gain the support of Clann na Poblachta, Mulcahy stepped aside in favour of Costello. Two Clann na Poblachta TDs joined the cabinet; MacBride became Minister for External Affairs while Noël Browne became Minister for Health.

On his ministerial accession, MacBride sent a telegram to Pope Pius XII offering:
...to repose at the feet of Your Holiness the assurance of our filial loyalty and our devotion to Your August Person, as well as our firm resolve to be guided in all our work by the teaching of Christ and to strive for the attainment of a social order in Ireland based on Christian principles.

At MacBride&#x27;s suggestion, Costello nominated the northern Protestant Denis Ireland to Seanad Éireann, the first resident of Northern Ireland to be appointed as a member of the Oireachtas. While a Senator (1948–1951), Ireland was Irish representative to the Council of Europe assisting MacBride in the leading role he was to play in securing acceptance of the European Convention on Human Rights—signed in Rome on 4 November 1950. In 1950, MacBride was president of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Council of Europe, and he was vice-president of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC, later OECD) in 1948–1951. He was responsible for Ireland not joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).

He was instrumental in the repeal of the External Relations Act and the passing of the Republic of Ireland Act which came into force in 1949. It declared that Ireland may officially be described as the Republic of Ireland and that the President of Ireland had the executive authority of the state in its external relations.

In 1951, MacBride controversially ordered Noël Browne to resign as a minister over the Mother and Child Scheme after it was attacked by the Irish Catholic hierarchy and the Irish medical establishment. Whatever the merits of the scheme, or of Browne, MacBride concluded in a Cabinet memorandum:
Even if, as Catholics, we were prepared to take the responsibility of disregarding [the Hierarchy&#x27;s] views, which I do not think we can do, it would be politically impossible to do so . . . We are dealing with the considered views of the leaders of the Catholic Church to which the vast majority of our people belong; these views cannot be ignored.

Also in 1951, Clann na Poblachta was reduced to two seats after the general election. MacBride kept his seat and was re-elected again in 1954. Opposing the internment of IRA suspects during the Border Campaign (1956–1962), he contested both the 1957 and 1961 general elections but failed to be elected both times. He then retired from politics and continued practising as a barrister.

==International roles and commissions==

After retiring from politics in Ireland, MacBride assumed various international commissions and roles. He was among a group of lawyers who founded JUSTICE—the UK-based human rights and law reform organisation—initially to monitor the show trials after the 1956 Budapest uprising. Later it became the UK section of the International Commission of Jurists for which MacBride, from 1963 to 1971, was Secretary-General. In 1966, his standing on the Commission was unsuccessfully challenged by US claims that he had been involved with a Central Intelligence Agency funding operation.

In 1961, MacBride was a co-founder of Amnesty International, and he served as its International Chairman until 1975.

In 1963, he had helped draft the constitution of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU); following consultations on the constitutions of newly-independent Ghana, Zambia and Tanzania.

In 1968, MacBride was elected Chair and, in 1975, President of the International Peace Bureau in Geneva, a position he retained until 1985. He was also involved in the International Prisoners of Conscience Fund.

In the course of the 1970s, he held various positions with the United Nations. In 1973, he was elected by the UN General Assembly to the post of High Commissioner for Namibia, with the rank of Assistant Secretary-General. It was thought that, represented by man whose father had volunteered to fight alongside their forefathers, the Afrikaner leadership of Apartheid South Africa would find the UN&#x27;s assurances in return for a withdrawal from Namibia more credible.

In 1977, MacBride was appointed president of the International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems, set up by UNESCO. In 1980, this produced the controversial MacBride Report which called for policies to reduce the international dominance of the Western media.

During the 1980s, he initiated the Appeal by Lawyers against Nuclear War which was jointly sponsored by the International Peace Bureau and the International Progress Organization. In close cooperation with Francis Boyle and Hans Köchler of the International Progress Organization he lobbied the General Assembly for a resolution demanding an Advisory Opinion from the International Court of Justice on the legality of nuclear arms. The Advisory Opinion on the &quot;Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons&quot; was eventually handed down by the ICJ in 1996.

In 1982, MacBride was chairman of the International Commission to enquire into reported violations of International Law by Israel during its invasion of the Lebanon. The other members were Richard Falk, Kader Asmal, Brian Bercusson, Géraud de la Pradelle, and Stefan Wild. The commission&#x27;s report, which concluded that &quot;the government of Israel has committed acts of aggression contrary to international law&quot;, was published in 1983 under the title &quot;Israel in Lebanon&quot;.

== Nobel Peace Prize and other international honours ==
MacBride&#x27;s work was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize (1974) as a man who &quot;mobilised the conscience of the world in the fight against injustice&quot;. He shared the prize with Eisaku Sato, the former Japanese Prime Minister acknowledged for his commitment to peace and non-proliferation.

Other international honours followed: the Lenin Peace Prize in 1975; the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1978; and the UNESCO Silver Medal for Service (1980). He received the Lenin Peace Prize for his opposition to what MacBride referred to as &quot;this absolutely obscene arms race.&quot; He was one of only two to win both the Lenin and Nobel peace prizes, the other being Linus Pauling.

== Last Irish interventions ==
In 1977, in the midst of the Northern Ireland Troubles, MacBride co-operating with Desmond Boal (QC and former chairman of Ian Paisley&#x27;s Democratic Unionist Party) as joint mediator in confidential negotiations between the Provisional IRA (PIRA) and the Ulster Volunteer Force about a federal settlement for Ireland. Their efforts included a meeting, brokered by West Belfast priest Des Wilson, between Boal and Gerry Adams. Inasmuch as their exchange was &quot;frank&quot;, Adams found the discussion &quot;constructive&quot;, but it failed to identify common political ground.

In 1984, MacBride was one of four well-known Irish activists, two Catholic and two Protestants, who endorsed a set of fair-employment guidelines for American investment in Northern Ireland, intended to redress a history of sectarian discrimination. The campaign for what became known as the MacBride Principles resulted in both British and American legislation.

In the Irish Republic, MacBride edited a 1981 report of a Commission of Enquiry into the Irish Penal System. &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; broadly condemned the country&#x27;s prisons, unreformed since independence, for failing to address the task of offender rehabilitation and consequently for its high degree of recidivism.

In 1983, MacBride voted yes to the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, enshrining the legal ban on abortion, and wrote a newspaper article two days before stating his position. In 1985, he supported the largely female workforce in the Dunnes Stores Strike and attended at least one of their rallies.

==Later life and death==
In his later years, MacBride lived in his mother&#x27;s home, Roebuck House, which served as a meeting place for many years for Irish nationalists, as well as in the Parisian arrondissement where he grew up with his mother.

Seán MacBride died in Dublin on 15 January 1988, eleven days before his 84th birthday. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery alongside his mother, and his wife, who died in 1976.

On the occasion of MacBride&#x27;s death, Oliver Tambo of the African National Congress (ANC), stated &quot;Seán MacBride will always be remembered for the concrete leadership he provided to the liberation movement and people of Namibia and South Africa. Driven by his own personal and political insight arising out of the cause of national freedom in Ireland ... our debt to him can never be repaid.&quot;

==Legacy==
Streets in Windhoek, Namibia and Amsterdam are named after him. The Headquarters of Amnesty International Ireland is called &#x27;Seán MacBride House&#x27; in his honour. and the International Peace Bureau likewise named the &#x27;Seán MacBride Prize&#x27; in his name.

A bust of MacBride was unveiled in Iveagh House, headquarters of the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs in 1995.

==In popular culture==
A novel, &quot;The Casting of Mr O&#x27;Shaughnessy&quot;, was published in 1995 (revised edition 2002) by Éamon Delaney in which the eponymous Mr O&#x27;Shaughnessy was, in the author&#x27;s own words &quot;partly, but quite obviously, based on the career of the colourful Seán MacBride&quot;.

<text>Protoplasm (; ) is the part of a cell that is surrounded by a plasma membrane. It is a mixture of small molecules such as ions, monosaccharides, amino acids, and macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, etc.

In some definitions, it is a general term for the cytoplasm (e.g., Mohl, 1846), but for others, it also includes the nucleoplasm (e.g., Strasburger, 1882). For Sharp (1921), &quot;According to the older usage the extra-nuclear portion of the protoplast [&quot;the entire cell, excluding the cell wall&quot;] was called &quot;protoplasm,&quot; but the nucleus also is composed of protoplasm, or living substance in its broader sense. The current consensus is to avoid this ambiguity by employing Strasburger&#x27;s (1882) terms cytoplasm [&quot;coined by Kölliker (1863), originally as synonym for protoplasm&quot;] and nucleoplasm [&quot;term coined by van Beneden (1875), or karyoplasm, used by Flemming (1878)&quot;].&quot; The cytoplasm definition of Strasburger excluded the plastids (&quot;Chromatoplasm&quot;).

Like the nucleus, whether to include the vacuole in the protoplasm concept is controversial.

==Terminology==
Besides &quot;protoplasm&quot;, many other related terms and distinctions were used for the cell contents over time. These were as follows: 
* &quot;Urschleim&quot; (Oken, 1802, 1809),
* &quot;Protoplasma&quot; (Purkinje, 1840, von Mohl, 1846),
* &quot;Primordialschlauch&quot; (primordial utricle, von Mohl, 1846),
* &quot;sarcode&quot; (Dujardin, 1835, 1841),
* &quot;Cytoplasma&quot; (Kölliker, 1863),
* &quot;Hautschicht/Körnerschicht&quot; (ectoplasm/endoplasm, Pringsheim, 1854; Hofmeister, 1867),
* &quot;Grundsubstanz&quot; (ground substance, Cienkowski, 1863),
* metaplasm/protoplasm (Hanstein, 1868), 
* deutoplasm/protoplasm (van Beneden, 1870),
* bioplasm (Beale, 1872),
* paraplasm/protoplasm (Kupffer, 1875), 
* inter-filar substance theory (Velten, 1876)
* &quot;Hyaloplasma&quot; (Pfeffer, 1877), 
* &quot;Protoplast&quot; (Hanstein, 1880), 
* &quot;Enchylema/Hyaloplasma&quot; (Hanstein, 1880), 
* &quot;Kleinkörperchen&quot; or &quot;Mikrosomen&quot; (small bodies or microsomes, Hanstein, 1882),
* paramitome (Flemming, 1882), 
* &quot;Idioplasma&quot; (Nageli, 1884), 
* &quot;Zwischensubstanz&quot; (inter-alveolar substance, Bütschli, 1892), 
* &quot;Grundplasma&quot; (ground plasma, Schütt, 1895),
* &quot;ergastoplasme&quot; (Garnier, 1897),
* phaneroplasm/cryptoplasm (Seifriz, 1931),
* cytoplasmic matrix (Munson, 1899; &quot;zytoplasmatische Matrix&quot;, Bergmann, 1956),
* &quot;Protoplasma- oder Zelleinschlüsse&quot; (protoplasmic or cellular inclusions, Szymonowicz, 1901),
* kinoplasm/trophoplasm (Strasburger et at., 1912),
* cytosol (Lardy, 1965).

==History==
The word &quot;protoplasm&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;protos&quot; for &quot;first&quot;, and &quot;plasma&quot; for &quot;thing formed&quot;, and was originally used in religious contexts. It was used in 1839 by J. E. Purkinje for the material of the animal embryo. Later, in 1846 Hugo von Mohl redefined the term (also named as &quot;Primordialschlauch&quot;, &quot;primordial utricle&quot;) to refer to the &quot;tough, slimy, granular, semi-fluid&quot; substance within plant cells, to distinguish this from the cell wall and the cell sap (&quot;Zellsaft&quot;) within the vacuole. Max Schultze in 1861 proposed the &quot;Protoplasm Doctrine&quot; which states that &quot;all living cells are made of a living substance called Protoplasm&quot;. Thomas Huxley (1869) later referred to it as the &quot;physical basis of life&quot; and considered that the property of life resulted from the distribution of molecules within this substance. The protoplasm became an &quot;epistemic thing&quot;. Its composition, however, was mysterious and there was much controversy over what sort of substance it was.

In 1872, Beale created the vitalist term &quot;bioplasm&quot;, to contrast with the materialism of Huxley. In 1880, term protoplast was proposed by Hanstein (1880) for the entire cell, excluding the cell wall, and some authors like Julius von Sachs (1882) preferred that name instead of cell.

In 1965, Lardy introduced the term &quot;cytosol&quot;, later redefined to refer to the liquid inside cells.

By the time Huxley wrote, a long-standing debate was largely settled over the fundamental unit of life: was it the cell or was it protoplasm? By the late 1860s, the debate was largely settled in favor of protoplasm. The cell was a container for protoplasm, the fundamental and universal material substance of life. Huxley&#x27;s principal contribution was to establish protoplasm as incompatible with a vitalistic theory of life. Attempts to investigate the origin of life through the creation of synthetic &quot;protoplasm&quot; in the laboratory were not successful.

The idea that protoplasm of eukaryotes is simply divisible into a ground substance called &quot;cytoplasm&quot; and a structural body called the cell nucleus reflects the more primitive knowledge of cell structure that preceded the development of electron microscopy, when it seemed that cytoplasm was a homogeneous fluid and the existence of most sub-cellular compartments, or how cells maintain their shape, was unknown. Today, it is known that the cell contents are structurally very complex and contain multiple organelles, the cytoskeleton and biomolecular condensates.the word protoplasm is mainly divided in to two parts cytoplasm and nucleus.

== Description ==

===Physical nature===
Protoplasm is physically translucent, granular slimy, semifluid or viscous. In it, granules of different shapes and sizes are suspended in solution. It may exist in two interchangeable states which are more liquid-like sol state and more solid-like gel state which is like jelly. The constituent molecules are free to move in sol state, while in gel state, the constituent molecules are compactly arranged. Protoplasm becomes opaque when it is heated. It also coagulates on heating. It occurs everywhere in the cell. In eukaryotes, the portion of protoplasm surrounding the cell nucleus is known as the cytoplasm and the portion inside the nucleus as the nucleoplasm. In prokaryotes the material inside the plasma membrane is the bacterial cytoplasm, while in Gram-negative bacteria the region outside the plasma membrane but inside the outer membrane is the periplasm.

=== Chemical composition ===
There are about 30 elements, like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, calcium and many others which are identified in protoplasm of different cells. They form compounds, like water (65-80%), carbohydrates, ions, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), fatty acids, glycerol, nucleotides, nucleosides and minerals. They are living as long as they are part of protoplasm. They are not able to perform functions of life independently. The composition of protoplasm is inconsistent and continuous changes take place in it.

=== Functions ===
Some functions of protoplasm are:

# It provides place where all life functions occur
# The cells respond to various stimuli like temperature, light, chemicals, gravitation, pricking, electric shocks and others because of properties of protoplasm.
# Cyclosis (the streaming movement of protoplasm is known as Cyclosis. It helps in even distribution of various materials in the cells.)
