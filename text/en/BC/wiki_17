<text>Arthur Joseph &quot;Monkey&quot; Gould (10 October 1864 – 2 January 1919) was a Welsh international rugby union centre and fullback who was most associated as a club player with Newport Rugby Football Club. He won 27 caps for Wales, 18 as captain, and critics consider him the first superstar of Welsh rugby. A talented all-round player and champion sprinter, Gould could side-step and kick expertly with either foot. He never ceased practising to develop his fitness and skills, and on his death was described as &quot;the most accomplished player of his generation&quot;.

Following the withdrawal of their regular fullback, Newport RFC first selected Gould in 1882, when he was 18. He was never dropped from the side thereafter and played regularly until he retired in 1898. Gould played for Newport during their &quot;invincible&quot; season of 1891–92, when they did not lose a match, and scored a record 37 tries in Newport&#x27;s 24-game 1893–94 season, a club record that still stands. Gould frequently travelled due to his job as a public contractor, and consequently turned out for a number of other sides during his career, including the clubs Richmond and London Welsh, and the county side Middlesex.

Gould was first selected for Wales in 1885 when he played at fullback against England. He was awarded the captaincy in 1889, by which time he was playing at centre, and led Wales to their first Home Nations Championship and Triple Crown titles in 1893; that tournament&#x27;s match against England established Gould as a great player and captain. By the time Gould retired he was the most capped Welsh centre, a record he held until 1980, with 25 caps in the position. He ended his international career against England on 9 January 1897. The game, played in front of 17,000 supporters at Rodney Parade, was Gould&#x27;s 18th as Wales captain – a record eventually broken by Ieuan Evans in 1994.

Towards the end of his career, Gould was at the centre of a controversy known as the &quot;Gould affair&quot; that saw Wales withdraw from international rugby for a year. The controversy centred on the support of the Welsh Football Union (WFU) for a testimonial for Gould on his retirement. The English Rugby Football Union and International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) argued that the testimonial constituted professionalism – which they claimed breached the sport&#x27;s by-laws. The WFU withdrew from the IRFB in protest, rejoining a year later under the IRFB-imposed condition that Gould would not represent Wales again. He worked as a brewery representative after retiring from rugby, and died of an internal haemorrhage in 1919 at the age of 54.

== Family and early years ==
Arthur Joseph Gould was born into a sporting family in Newport, Wales, on 10 October 1864 to Joseph and Elizabeth. His father, from Oxford, England, moved to Newport to find work, setting up his own brass foundry business. Joseph was also an ardent sportsman, playing for the local cricket team.

Gould&#x27;s five brothers were all notable rugby players and athletes. His brother Bob was a forward who played 136 times for Newport Rugby Football Club, whom he captained in the 1886–87 season. Bob was also capped 11 times for Wales between 1882 and 1887, and captained his country once, versus Scotland in 1887. A younger brother, Bert, was a centre who played three times for Wales – he appeared with Gould in the Welsh team that won the Triple Crown for the first time in 1893. His other brothers – Harry, Gus and Wyatt – all played rugby for Newport. Wyatt captained Newport in 1905–06, and Harry played for them in their inaugural season of 1875–76. For the first 29 seasons of its existence, Newport RFC always had at least one of the Gould brothers in the team. Wyatt played for the club until 1907; he also ran the 400 m hurdles for Great Britain in the 1908 Summer Olympics.

The young Gould often climbed trees, and thus acquired the childhood nickname &quot;Monkey&quot;, which was soon contracted by most to &quot;Monk&quot;. Like his brother Wyatt, he was a keen athlete and made £1,000 during his years as a rugby player by entering track and field meets. A county champion sprinter and hurdler, Gould finished third in the Amateur Athletic Association 120-yard hurdles in 1887 and 1893.

== Rugby career ==

=== Club and county history ===

At the age of 14 Gould captained the Newport Junior team, and later played a few games for the Third XV. Gould was drafted into the First XV – the senior team – as a fullback at the age of 18. On 18 November 1882 Newport had a home fixture against Weston-super-Mare at Rodney Parade. The Newport groundsman, John Butcher, had been sent by the club to collect the regular fullback who had not appeared for the game. Gould, who was returning from a youth match, saw Butcher outside the missing fullback&#x27;s home and approached the groundsman to discover that the player was at a funeral. Butcher offered Gould the position instead, and then the groundsman successfully persuaded the club captain to play him. Gould ran in two of his team&#x27;s three tries after disregarding the instructions of his captain, Charlie Newman, who kept shouting for Gould to &quot;Kick, kick!&quot; After this, he was not dropped by Newport until his retirement in 1898.

As rugby was then an exclusively amateur sport, Gould and his brother Bob travelled Britain working as public works contractors. During this time he entered open athletic meets and played for various English rugby teams including the Southampton Trojans, and from 1887 was a regular member of the London side Richmond. In 1885 Gould was invited to play for the newly formed Welsh exiles team London Welsh. London Scottish F.C. had been founded for Scottish players working or studying in the city, but until this time a London club for Welsh players had not existed. The side&#x27;s first game, a trial match, was played on 21 October 1885 at Putney, and three days later the first team played London Scottish at the Saracens&#x27; Palmerston Road ground in Walthamstow. Gould played at half-back, and was joined in the team by Martyn Jordan, Thomas Judson, Rowley Thomas, Charles Taylor and T. Williams – all past or future Welsh internationals. During the 1885–86 season London Welsh were invited to form a combined &quot;exiles&quot; team with London Scottish, to face a London XV in a charity match at The Oval. Gould was one of six Welsh players selected to play in front of a crowd of 8,000 that included the Prince of Wales.

In the 1885–86 season he was moved up to play as a threequarter for Newport. As he was frequently travelling and playing in England between 1885 and 1890, Gould was not a regular member of the team. After playing just a handful games during the three seasons preceding it, in the 1889–90 season he managed 15 games for the club – scoring ten tries and five dropped goals.

In June 1890 Gould left Britain to complete a works contract in the West Indies, but returned to Newport in time for the 1891–92 season. Newport were unbeaten throughout that campaign, which was later dubbed their &quot;invincible&quot; season. Gould captained Newport between 1893–94, when the team lost only three games, and in the 1894–95 season, in which the club lost only to Llanelli. During his first period as captain, 1893–94, Gould scored 37 tries in 24 games, a club record that still stands as of 2013. Although records before 1886 are incomplete, Newport RFC acknowledge Gould&#x27;s scoring record at the club between the 1882–83 and 1898–99 seasons as 159 tries, 66 conversions, 61 dropped goals and a single penalty, over 231 appearances.

Gould also turned out for the Middlesex county side, and was a mainstay during their &quot;invincible&quot; season of 1887–88. He also played for them against the New Zealand Native team in 1888. The match, hosted by the Earl of Sheffield, was an invitation only event. The Middlesex side won 9–0, and scored three tries in the match, the second one resulting from a smart pass by Gould. In addition to Gould, the Middlesex backline of the time regularly fielded a number of English and Scottish internationals – this earned the side the sarcastic nickname &quot;the Imperial team&quot;.

=== International career ===

==== 1885–89 ====
Gould was first capped for Wales against England in the opening game of the 1885 Home Nations Championship. He joined his brother Bob in the side, and played at fullback, his preferred position at the time. Played under the captaincy of Newport teammate Charlie Newman, this was Wales&#x27; eighth-ever international and fourth encounter with England. The Welsh lost by a goal and a try to a goal and four tries. Wing Martyn Jordan of London Welsh scored both Welsh tries, with one successfully converted into a goal. Some accounts award the conversion to Charles Taylor, though it is now generally credited to Gould. Gould was selected for the second game of the tournament, an away draw to Scotland, in which both teams played a pair of brothers; George and Richard Maitland for Scotland, and Arthur and Bob Gould for Wales.
By 1886 the four threequarter system had spread throughout Wales. First instituted by Cardiff RFC in 1884, the system was designed to allow Cardiff centres Frank Hancock and Tom Williams to play at the same time, and involved dropping the ninth forward to include a second centre. Newport were reluctant to adopt this style of play, mainly due to Gould&#x27;s excellent kicking and covering abilities, which allowed the club to continue with the advantage of the extra forward.

For the 1885–86 season Gould switched from fullback at Newport to the centre position; this tactic was adopted by Wales and Gould replaced Cardiff&#x27;s Hancock at centre for their first match of the 1886 Home Nations Championship against England. The match resulted in a Welsh loss. In Wales&#x27; next game, against Scotland, Wales became the first country to trial the four threequarter system. They did this by bringing back Hancock as captain and having him play at centre alongside Gould. The experiment was a tactical disaster – the eight Welsh forwards struggled against the nine Scottish forwards. Hancock duly regrouped the team at half-time and readopted the standard formation, bringing Harry Bowen from fullback into the pack, and pushing Gould from centre into Bowen&#x27;s vacant position. Wales lost by two goals to nil, the system was deemed a failure and Hancock never represented Wales again. The whole affair had a negative effect on Gould, who initially disliked the strategy, stating that he was &quot;prejudiced against the four three-quarters.&quot; Gould even went as far as persuading the Welsh selectors to revert to the old formation. The next time Wales trialled the system was in the 1888 encounter with the touring New Zealand Natives, a match in which Gould was unavailable to play.

In the next season, Wales completed their first full Home Nations Championship; Gould played as the lone centre in all three games. It was a fairly successful Championship for the Welsh, with a draw, a win and a loss, leaving them second in the table. Of note during the series was Bob Gould&#x27;s captaincy in the second match, against Scotland, and Gould&#x27;s first ever international dropped goal – which gave Wales a win over Ireland and made up for him missing a dropped goal by just a yard in their draw against England. Due to work commitments, Gould only played one of the two Wales games of the 1888 Home Nations Championship, in the country&#x27;s first victory over Scotland, thanks to a single try from Thomas Pryce-Jenkins. In the second game, played away to Ireland, George Bowen was given the centre position in the last match Wales would play with a three threequarter system. Gould then missed the first Welsh international against an overseas touring side, when the New Zealand Natives were beaten at St. Helen&#x27;s in Swansea, and was still absent two months later for the opening game of the 1889 Championship. Gould returned in time for the clash with Ireland where he was given the captaincy and played alongside Llanelli centre Tom Morgan. Gould lost his first match as captain, losing by two tries to nil at home – this was the first of 18 caps he earned leading his country.

==== 1890–93 ====
Gould appeared in Wales&#x27; three matches of the 1890 Home Nations Championship where he partnered Dickie Garrett, a coal tipper who played for Penarth, at centre. Gould lost the team captaincy for the first match to Frank Hill, a game which Wales lost to Scotland 5–1, though Gould did score his first international try. The game is also notable for featuring the first appearance of Billy Bancroft, the Swansea all-round sportsman who would take over the captaincy from Gould on his retirement. Bancroft was fullback in Gould&#x27;s next 18 international games. Gould regained the captaincy for the next game, an encounter with England at Crown Flatt in Dewsbury, and from that point held the captaincy whenever he represented Wales. The encounter was an historic day for Wales, with the country&#x27;s first win over England, a single try from Buller Stadden giving Wales the victory. The campaign ended in a disappointing away draw with Ireland, which saw the introduction of Tom Graham, a Newport forward who would become Gould&#x27;s club captain during the 1891–92 &quot;invincible&quot; season.

Gould missed the entire 1891 campaign as he and his brother Bob had travelled to the West Indies to conduct civil engineering work. Gould regained his international place and the captaincy on his return for the 1892 Home Nations Championship. The tournament was a failure for Wales; the team lost all three of their matches. There was little consistency for Gould at centre, with three different centre-pairings in each of the matches; Garrett against England, Conway Rees at home to Scotland and in the Irish encounter, Gould&#x27;s younger brother Bert. The 1892 Championship was soured by the aftermath of the Wales–Scotland encounter, which was played in Swansea at St. Helen&#x27;s. After Wales lost the game 7–2, members of the crowd, angered by Jack Hodgson&#x27;s refereeing of the game, attacked him. The assailants by-passed the police and the referee had to be rescued by members of the Welsh team. In the struggle, Gould was struck on the chin, and it was reported that Hodgson only reached the Mackworth Hotel because Gould accompanied him on the coach.

The Welsh performance during the 1893 Home Nations Championship was in stark contrast to the previous year. Under the captaincy of Gould, Wales not only won the Championship for the first time, but also the Triple Crown. The first match of the campaign was against England, and played at the Cardiff Arms Park. The pitch had been kept from freezing over the night before by 500 braziers dispersed across the playing field. This led to a slippery ground, with play further hampered by a strong wind.

The English played the first half with the wind behind them and their nine-man scrum dominated the smaller Welsh pack. At half time Wales were 7–0 down following tries from Frederick Lohden and Howard Marshall and a conversion from England captain Andrew Stoddart. The second half started poorly for Wales when Marshall scored a second try following excellent English forward pressure. The game turned not long after: the English forwards could not maintain the pace they had set in the first half of the game, and began to slow. Then Welsh forward Charles Nicholl broke through a line-out with the ball, transferred it to Hannan, who passed to Gould at the halfway line. Gould evaded both Alderson and Lockwood before outpacing Edwin Field to score beneath the posts. Bancroft converted. A near identical move resulted in Conway Rees then releasing Cardiff wing Norman Biggs who scored with a run from the half-way line, though this time the conversion missed.

The Welsh backs repeatedly exposed the three threequarter system used by the English, as once the Welsh backs broke through the pack there was little defensive-cover to prevent run away scores. With the score at 9–7 to England, Marshall extended the lead with his third try of the match. This gave England an 11–7 lead with only ten minutes remaining. The game swung again when Percy Phillips received ball quickly before passing to Gould. Gould broke through the English defence and scored, though again Bancroft missed the conversion. With further Welsh pressure, a penalty was awarded to Wales on the English 25-yard line, but at a wide angle. Accounts differ as to what happened; some say that Gould tried to place the ball for Bancroft, but failed on the frozen ground, another states that Bancroft defied his captain to take the penalty as a drop kick, while other accounts mention Bancroft and Gould arguing on the pitch before Bancroft&#x27;s attempt. Regardless, Bancroft kicked the penalty, the first penalty to be scored in an international match. It was the final score of the game and Wales were victorious, 12–11.

At the final whistle the pitch was invaded by Welsh fans and Gould was carried shoulder-high back to the Angel Hotel, cheered all the way. It was a defining moment for the Welsh style of play. England adopted the four threequarter system the following year.

Gould continued to captain the Wales team through victory over Scotland, with tries coming from Bert Gould, Biggs and William McCutcheon; all the result of precision handling from the backs. This left the final encounter with Ireland, played at Stradey Park in Llanelli, as the deciding match for a Welsh Triple Crown. Despite an unconvincing Welsh display, an enthusiastic crowd of 20,000 watched their country win the game and with it the title, decided by a single try from Bert Gould.

==== 1894–97 ====

The 1894 Championship began with a loss for the defending champions against England, during a game in which Welsh in-fighting affected the result. Before the game, Gould instructed his forwards to heel the ball from the scrums swiftly, so it would get to the backs quickly and allow them to run at the English. Frank Hill decided that this was the wrong option and put all his might into wheeling the scrums instead, which worked against the efforts of Jim Hannan, who was trying to follow his captain&#x27;s wishes. In the next match Gould was partnered by Dai Fitzgerald in a win over Scotland, but was unavailable for the encounter with Ireland and was replaced by Jack Elliott from Cardiff RFC.

By 1895 the only backs remaining from the 1893 Championship-winning team were Bancroft and Gould. Gould was now partnered with Owen Badger, who kept his place for the whole campaign. As the other teams adopted the Welsh style of play, Wales lost their advantage; the livelier English forwards outplayed their Welsh counterparts to give England victory in the opening game of the 1895 Championship. This was followed by a close loss to Scotland at Raeburn Place and then a narrow win over Ireland at the Cardiff Arms Park.

1896 was Gould&#x27;s last full international tournament. The Championship started badly for Wales with a heavy defeat by England, during which Wales were reduced to 14 men after Badger broke his collar-bone in the first 15 minutes. In the second game Wales beat Scotland 6–0, with a try each for Gould and Cliff Bowen. The final game of the Championship was an away loss to Ireland, in which Gould scored his last international points with a dropped goal. At the end of 1896 Gould decided to retire from rugby.

In 1897, Gould was enticed out of retirement for one last Championship. By now Gould was a household name throughout Britain, as much due to his personality and good looks as his brilliant centre play; a testimonial fund had been started with contributions being made by the public. This caused a stir among the other Home Unions, who viewed this as an effort to pay Gould for playing, which would constitute professionalism. As the arguments continued, Gould played his final international game, a solid 11–0 win over England in early January. Wales played no further matches that season after the events behind Gould&#x27;s testimonial fund caused Wales to leave the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB), in a situation now referred to as the &quot;Gould affair&quot;.

==== Matches played ====
== Gould affair ==

By 1896 Gould had played more first class matches, scored more tries and dropped more goals than any other player on record. This led to &quot;South Wales Argus&quot; journalist W. J. Townsend Collins, to write in the paper: &quot;... as Arthur Gould is as pre-eminent in football as W. G. Grace is in cricket, the footballing enthusiasts of Wales might recognise his services to the game ... by some national testimonial.&quot;

A Welsh shipbroker, W. J. Orders, organised a collection fund on the floor of the Cardiff Coal Exchange and floated a public testimonial of one shilling. The national response was considerable and within weeks the total was into hundreds of pounds. This drew the Welsh Football Union (WFU) into a confrontation with the IRFB, as rule 2 on professionalism stated that no player was allowed to receive money from his club, or any member of his club, for services rendered to football. The fund could have been seen as a professional fee to Gould, henceforth making him ineligible to play for his country. The WFU argued that the money raised was not given by the club, but rather an outpouring of thanks from the Welsh public to a national hero.

By April 1896 the Welsh Football Union had sanctioned a subscription of 1,000 shillings to be contributed to the Gould testimonial. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) complained and the IRFB reacted by informing the WFU that only a plate up to the value of a hundred pounds sterling could be given to Gould, and that the remaining funds should be donated to charity; otherwise Wales would lose their international fixtures. The WFU stood down and withdrew their subscription. The reaction in Wales was one of anger, with the people feeling that the WFU had bowed to English pressure, and had been bullied into a decision against the people&#x27;s wishes.

In a move that was described as an act of hurt pride by social historian David Smith, but also as a manoeuvre to appease the Welsh supporters, in February 1897 the WFU wrote to the IRFB and withdrew their membership. The WFU claimed that they alone had authority over the matter because the IRFB did not have any rules regarding amateurism. The WFU then reinstated their subscription to Gould, and on Easter Monday 1897 a banquet was arranged at Drill Hall in Newport in Gould&#x27;s honour. Many civic and sporting worthies were in attendance to witness the WFU president Sir John Llewellyn present Gould with the title deeds of a gift house. The 250 guests, including David A. Thomas, were joined by a reed and string orchestra, the band of the Fourth Battalion of the South Wales Borderers, and galleries packed by members of the public.

Wales did not field an international team until the IRFB, supported by the RFU, recommended that the WFU be readmitted into the organisation in February 1898. The WFU agreed that they would in future abide by all IRFB by-laws, and that Gould not be allowed to play in any future internationals. Gould accepted the ruling but returned to rugby as a referee and Welsh international selector. The compromise prevented a long term split in the sport, and by 1901 the IRFB added laws to the game banning professionalism to clarify their authority on the issue.

== Later life and legacy ==

After retiring from rugby, Gould became a brewery representative around Newport. He was still a very popular figure and was followed during his work by fans; his image was still worth money, appearing on merchandise such as cigarette cards and matchboxes.

Gould died in 1919, at the age of 54. Falling ill at work on 2 January, he was rushed home where he died later that day of an internal haemorrhage. His funeral was reported as the biggest ever seen in Wales up to that time; it was surpassed three decades later by that of the former British Prime Minister David Lloyd George. Gould was buried at St Woolos Cemetery, Newport. In reporting his death, &quot;The Times&quot; stated:
In 1923 a memorial fund was raised in Gould&#x27;s name, the donations of which were given to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport. The hospital recognised the gift with the Arthur Gould Memorial Bed, inscribed: &quot;To the memory of Arthur Gould – Greatest of Rugby Football Players&quot;. The bed was lost, however, when a portion of the hospital was demolished. Donations for the memorial, which totalled £1,525, were received from all over the world, and several matches were staged to raise funds, including a fixture between Newport and Cardiff.

Gould has been described as the first superstar of his sport by rugby historian Terry Godwin while David Smith in the &quot;Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union&quot; described him as the first player to surpass national recognition, becoming in both meanings of the word &quot;an international&quot;. The Welsh Academy&#x27;s Encyclopedia of Wales, published over 90 years after his death, records Gould as &quot;Welsh rugby&#x27;s first superstar&quot;, while a 1919 obituary described him as &quot;the most accomplished player of his generation&quot;. He set several long-standing records for his country, including captaining Wales 18 times, a number eventually surpassed by Ieuan Evans in 1994. Gould played 25 matches at centre for Wales, a record that stood until beaten by Steve Fenwick in 1980. He was also the most capped Welsh player, with 27, at the time of his retirement.

Gould was inducted into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame in June 2007; members of Gould&#x27;s family were in attendance including his granddaughter Mary Hales. When Newport RFC set up their own hall of fame in 2012 the first person inaugurated was Gould. Gould was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame in November 2016.

<text>Albert Pierrepoint ( ; 30 March 1905 – 10 July 1992) was an English hangman who executed between 435 and 600 people in a 25-year career that ended in 1956. His father Henry and uncle Thomas were official hangmen before him.

Pierrepoint was born in Clayton in the West Riding of Yorkshire. His family struggled financially because of his father&#x27;s intermittent employment and heavy drinking. Pierrepoint knew from an early age that he wanted to become a hangman, and was taken on as an assistant executioner in September 1932, aged 27. His first execution was in December that year, alongside his uncle Tom. In October 1941 he undertook his first hanging as lead executioner.

During his tenure he hanged 200 people who had been convicted of war crimes in Germany and Austria, as well as several high-profile murderers—including Gordon Cummins (the Blackout Ripper), John Haigh (the Acid Bath Murderer) and John Christie (the Rillington Place Strangler). He undertook several contentious executions, including Timothy Evans, Derek Bentley and Ruth Ellis and executions for high treason—William Joyce (also known as Lord Haw-Haw) and John Amery—and treachery, with the hanging of Theodore Schurch.

In 1956 Pierrepoint was involved in a dispute with a sheriff over payment, leading to his retirement from hanging. He ran a pub in Lancashire from the mid-1940s until the 1960s. He wrote his memoirs in 1974 in which he concluded that capital punishment was not a deterrent, although he may have changed his position subsequently. He approached his task with gravitas and said that the execution was &quot;sacred to me&quot;. His life has been included in several works of fiction, such as the 2005 film &quot;Pierrepoint&quot;, in which he was portrayed by Timothy Spall.
==Biography==
===Early life===

Albert Pierrepoint was born on 30 March 1905 in Clayton in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was the third of five children and eldest son of Henry Pierrepoint and his wife Mary (). Henry had a series of jobs, including a butcher&#x27;s apprentice, clog maker and a carrier in a local mill, but employment was mostly short-term. With intermittent employment, the family often had financial problems, worsened by Henry&#x27;s heavy drinking. From 1901 Henry had been on the list of official executioners. The role was part-time, with payment made only for individual hangings, rather than an annual stipend or salary, and there was no pension included with the position.

Henry was removed from the list of executioners in July 1910 after arriving drunk at a prison the day before an execution and excessively berating his assistant. Henry&#x27;s brother Thomas became an official executioner in 1906. Pierrepoint did not find out about his father&#x27;s former job until 1916, when Henry&#x27;s memoirs were published in a newspaper. Influenced by his father and uncle, when asked at school to write about what job he would like when older, Pierrepoint said that &quot;When I leave school I should like to be public executioner like my dad is, because it needs a steady man with good hands like my dad and my Uncle Tom and I shall be the same&quot;.

In 1917 the Pierrepoint family left Huddersfield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and moved to Failsworth, near Oldham, Lancashire. Henry&#x27;s health declined and he was unable to undertake physical work; as a result, Pierrepoint left school and began work at the local Marlborough Mills. Henry died in 1922 and Pierrepoint received two blue exercise books—in which his father had written his story as a hangman—and Henry&#x27;s execution diary, which listed details of each hanging in which he had participated. In the 1920s Pierrepoint left the mill and became a drayman for a wholesale grocer, delivering goods ordered through a travelling salesman. By 1930 he had learned to drive a car and a lorry to make his deliveries; he later became manager of the business.

===As assistant executioner, 1931–1940===

On 19 April 1931 Pierrepoint wrote to the Prison Commissioners and applied to be an assistant executioner. He was turned down; there were no vacancies. He received an invitation for an interview six months later. He was accepted and spent four days training at Pentonville Prison, London, where a dummy was used for practice. He received his formal acceptance letter as an assistant executioner at the end of September 1932. At that time, the assistant&#x27;s fee was per execution (equivalent to £ in , when adjusted for inflation). Another was paid two weeks later if his conduct and behaviour were satisfactory. The executioner was chosen by the county high sheriff—or more commonly delegated to the undersheriff, who selected both the hangman and the assistant. Executioners and their assistants were required to be discreet and the rules for those roles included the clause:

He should clearly understand that his conduct and general behaviour should be respectable, not only at the place and time of the execution, but before and subsequently, that he should avoid attracting public attention in going to or from the prison, and he is prohibited from giving to any person particulars on the subject of his duty for publication.
In late December 1932 Pierrepoint undertook his first execution. His uncle Tom had been contracted by the government of the Irish Free State for the hanging of Patrick McDermott, a young Irish farmer who had murdered his brother; Tom was free to select his own assistant as it was outside Britain, and took Pierrepoint with him. They travelled to the Mountjoy Prison, Dublin for the hanging. It was scheduled for 8:00 am, and took less than a minute to perform. Pierrepoint&#x27;s job as assistant was to follow the prisoner onto the scaffold, bind the prisoner&#x27;s legs together, then step back off the trapdoor before the lead executioner sprang the mechanism.

For the remainder of the 1930s Pierrepoint worked in the grocery business and as an assistant executioner. Most of his commissions were with his uncle Tom, from whom Pierrepoint learned much. He was particularly impressed with his uncle&#x27;s approach and demeanour, which were dignified and discreet; he also followed Tom&#x27;s advice &quot;if you can&#x27;t do it without whisky, don&#x27;t do it at all.&quot;

In July 1940 Pierrepoint was the assistant at the execution of Udham Singh, an Indian revolutionary who had been convicted of shooting the colonial administrator Sir Michael O&#x27;Dwyer. The day before the execution, Stanley Cross, the newly promoted lead executioner, became confused with his calculations of the drop length, and Pierrepoint stepped in to advise on the correct measurements; Pierrepoint was added to the list of head executioners soon after.

===As lead executioner, 1940–1956===
In October 1941 Pierrepoint undertook his first execution as lead executioner when he hanged the gangland killer Antonio &quot;Babe&quot; Mancini. He followed the routine as established by Home Office guidelines, and as followed by his predecessors. He and his assistant arrived the day before the execution, where he was told the height and weight of the prisoner; he viewed the condemned man through the &quot;Judas hole&quot; in the door to judge his build. Pierrepoint then went to the execution room—normally next to the condemned cell—where he tested the equipment using a sack that weighed about the same as the prisoner; he calculated the length of the drop using the Home Office Table of Drops, making allowances for the man&#x27;s physique, if necessary. He left the weighted sack hanging on the rope to ensure the rope was stretched and it would be re-adjusted in the morning if necessary.
On the day of the execution, the practice was for Pierrepoint, his assistant and two prison officers to enter the condemned man&#x27;s cell at 8:00 am. Pierrepoint secured the man&#x27;s arms behind his back with a leather strap, and all five walked through a second door, which led to the execution chamber. The prisoner was walked to a marked spot on the trapdoor whereupon Pierrepoint placed a white hood over the prisoner&#x27;s head and a noose around his neck. The metal eye through which the rope was looped was placed under the left jawbone which, when the prisoner dropped, forced the head back and broke the spine. Pierrepoint pushed a large lever, releasing the trapdoor. From entering the condemned man&#x27;s cell to opening the trapdoor took him a maximum of 12 seconds. The neck was broken in almost exactly the same position in each hanging—the hangman&#x27;s fracture.

====War-related executions====
During the Second World War Pierrepoint hanged 15 German spies, as well as US servicemen found guilty by courts martial of committing capital crimes in England. In December 1941 he executed the German spy Karel Richter at Wandsworth Prison. When Pierrepoint entered the condemned man&#x27;s cell for the hanging, Richter stood up, threw aside one of the guards and charged headfirst at the stone wall. Stunned momentarily, he rose and shook his head. After Richter struggled with the guards, Pierrepoint managed to get the leather strap around Richter&#x27;s wrists. He burst the leather strap from eye-hole to eye-hole and was free again. After another struggle, the strap was wrapped tightly around his wrists. He was brought to the scaffold where a strap was wrapped around his ankles, followed by a cap and noose. Just as Pierrepoint pushed the lever, Richter jumped up with bound feet. As Richter plummeted through the trapdoor, Pierrepoint could see that the noose had slipped, but it became stuck under Richter&#x27;s nose. Despite the unusual position of the noose, the prison medical officer determined that it was an instantaneous, clean death. Writing about the execution in his memoirs, Pierrepoint called it &quot;my toughest session on the scaffold during all my career as an executioner&quot;. The broken strap was given to Pierrepoint as a souvenir; he used it occasionally for what he thought were meaningful executions.

In August 1943 Pierrepoint married Anne Fletcher after a courtship of five years. He did not tell her about his role of executioner until a few weeks after the nuptials when he was flown to Gibraltar to hang two saboteurs; on his return he explained the reason for his absence and she accepted it, saying that she had known about his second job all along, after hearing gossip locally.
In late 1945, following the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and the subsequent trial of the camp&#x27;s officials and functionaries, Pierrepoint was sent to Hamelin, Germany to carry out the executions of eleven of those sentenced to death, plus two other German war criminals convicted of murdering an RAF pilot in the Netherlands in March 1945. He disliked any publicity connected to his role and was unhappy that his name had been announced to the press by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery. When he flew to Germany, he was followed across the airfield by the press, which he described as being &quot;as unwelcome as a lynch mob&quot;. He was given the honorary military rank of lieutenant colonel and, on 13 December, he first executed the women individually, then the men two at a time. Pierrepoint travelled several times to Hamelin, and between December 1948 and October 1949 he executed 226 people, often over 10 a day, and on several occasions groups of up to 17 over 2 days.

Six days after the Belsen hangings in December 1945, Pierrepoint hanged John Amery at Wandsworth Prison. Amery, the eldest son of the cabinet minister Leo Amery, was a Nazi sympathiser who had visited prisoner-of-war camps in Germany to recruit allied prisoners for the British Free Corps; he had also broadcast to Britain to encourage men to join the Nazis. He pleaded guilty to treason. On 3 January 1946 Pierrepoint hanged William Joyce, also known as Lord Haw-Haw, who had been given the death sentence for high treason, although it was established that Joyce was born an American citizen, and therefore it was questionable if he was subject to the charge. The following day Pierrepoint hanged Theodore Schurch, a British soldier who had been found guilty under the Treachery Act 1940. Joyce was the last person to be executed in Britain for treason; the death penalty for treason was abolished with the introduction of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Schurch was the last person to be hanged in Britain for treachery, and the last to be hanged for any offence other than murder.

In September 1946 Pierrepoint travelled to Graz, Austria, to train staff at Karlau Prison in the British form of long-drop hanging. Previously, the Austrians had used a shorter drop, leaving the executed men to choke to death, rather than the faster long-drop kill. He undertook four double executions of prisoners, with his trainees acting as assistants. Despite Pierrepoint&#x27;s expertise as an executioner and his experience with hanging the German war criminals at Hamelin, he was not selected as the hangman to carry out the sentences handed down at the Nuremberg trials; the job went to an American, Master Sergeant John C. Woods, who was relatively inexperienced. The press was invited to observe the process, and pictures were later circulated which suggested the hangings had been poorly done. Wilhelm Keitel took 20 minutes to die after the trapdoor opened; the trap was not wide enough, so some of the men hit the edges as they fell—more than one person&#x27;s nose was torn off in the process—and others were strangled, rather than having their necks broken.

====Post-war executions====

After the war Pierrepoint left the delivery business and took over the lease of a pub, the Help the Poor Struggler on Manchester Road, in the Hollinwood area of Oldham. In the 1950s he left the pub and took a lease of the larger Rose and Crown at Much Hoole near Preston, Lancashire. He later said that he changed his main occupation because:

I wanted to run my own business so that I should be under no obligation when I took time off. ... I could take a three o&#x27;clock plane from Dublin after conducting an execution there and be opening my bar without comment at half past five.
In 1948 Parliament debated a new Criminal Justice Bill, which raised the question of whether to continue with the death penalty or not. While the debates were proceeding, no executions took place, and Pierrepoint worked solely in his pub. When the bill failed in the House of Lords, hangings resumed after a nine-month gap. The following year, the Home Secretary, Chuter Ede, set up a Royal Commission to look into capital punishment in the UK. Pierrepoint gave evidence in November 1950 and included a mock hanging at Wandsworth Prison for the commission members. The commission&#x27;s report was published in 1953 and resulted in the Homicide Act 1957 which reduced the grounds for execution by differentiating between capital and non-capital charges for homicide.

From the late 1940s and into the 1950s Pierrepoint, Britain&#x27;s most experienced executioner, carried out several more hangings, including those of prisoners described by his biographer, Brian Bailey, as &quot;the most notorious murderers of the period ... [and] three of the most controversial executions in the latter years of the death penalty.&quot; In August 1949 he hanged John Haigh, nicknamed &quot;the Acid Bath Murderer&quot;, as he had dissolved the bodies of his victims in sulphuric acid; Haigh admitted to nine murders, and tried to avoid hanging by saying he drank the blood of his victims and claiming insanity. The following year Pierrepoint hanged James Corbitt, one of the regular customers at Pierrepoint&#x27;s pub; the two had sung duets together and while Pierrepoint called Corbitt &quot;Tish&quot;, Corbitt returned the nickname &quot;Tosh&quot;. In his autobiography, Pierrepoint considered the matter:

As I polished the glasses, I thought if any man had a deterrent to murder poised before him, it was this troubadour whom I called Tish, coming to terms with his obsessions in the singing room of Help The Poor Struggler. He was not only aware of the rope, he had the man who handled it beside him, singing a duet. ... The deterrent did not work. He killed the thing he loved.

In March 1950 Pierrepoint hanged Timothy Evans, a 25-year-old man who had the vocabulary of a 14-year-old and the mental age of a ten-year-old. Evans was arrested for the murder of his wife and daughter at their home, the top floor flat of 10 Rillington Place, London. His statements to the police were contradictory, telling them that he killed her, and also that he was innocent. He was tried and convicted for the murder of his daughter. Three years later Evans&#x27;s landlord, John Christie, was arrested for the murder of several women, whose bodies he hid in the house. He subsequently admitted to the murder of Evans&#x27;s wife, but not the daughter. Pierrepoint hanged him in July 1953 in Pentonville Prison, but the case showed Evans&#x27;s conviction and hanging had been a miscarriage of justice. The matter led to further questions on the use of the death penalty in Britain.

In the months before he hanged Christie, Pierrepoint undertook another controversial execution, that of Derek Bentley, a 19-year-old man who had been an accomplice of Christopher Craig, a 16-year-old boy who shot and killed a policeman. Bentley was described in his trial as:

a youth of low intelligence, shown by testing to be just above the level of a feeble-minded person, illiterate, unable to read or write, and when tested in a way which did not involve scholastic knowledge shown to have a mental age between 11 and 12 years.

At the time the policeman was shot, Bentley had been under arrest for 15 minutes, and the words he said to Craig—&quot;Let him have it, Chris&quot;—could either have been taken for an incitement to shoot, or for Craig to hand his gun over (one policeman had asked him to hand the gun over just beforehand). Bentley was found guilty by the English law principle of joint enterprise.

Pierrepoint hanged Ruth Ellis for murder in July 1955. Ellis was in an abusive relationship with David Blakely, a racing driver; she shot him four times after what her biographer, Jane Dunn, called &quot;three days of sleeplessness, panic, and pathological jealousy, fuelled by quantities of Pernod and a reckless consumption of tranquillizers&quot;. The case attracted great interest from the press and public. The matter was discussed in Cabinet and a petition of 50,000 signatures was sent to the Home Secretary, Gwilym Lloyd George, to ask for a reprieve; he refused to grant one. Ellis was the last woman to be hanged in Britain. Two weeks after Ellis&#x27;s execution, Pierrepoint hanged Norman Green, who had confessed to killing two boys in the Wigan area; it was Pierrepoint&#x27;s last execution.

===Retirement and later life===
In early January 1956 Pierrepoint travelled to Manchester for another execution and paid for staff to cover the bar in his absence. He spent the afternoon in the prison calculating the drop and setting up the rope to the right length. That evening the prisoner was given a reprieve. Pierrepoint left the prison and, because of heavy snow, stayed overnight in a local hotel before returning home. Two weeks later he received from the instructing sheriff a cheque for his travelling expenses, but not his execution fee. He wrote to the Prison Commissioners to point out that he had received a full fee in other cases of reprieve, and that he had spent additional money in employing bar staff. The Commissioners advised he speak to the instructing sheriff, as it was his responsibility, not theirs; they also reminded him that his conditions of employment were that he was paid only for the execution, not in the case of a reprieve. Shortly afterwards he received a letter from the sheriff offering £4 as a compromise. On 23 February he replied to the Prison Commissioners and informed them that he was resigning with immediate effect, and requested that his name be taken from the list of executioners.

There were soon rumours in the press that his resignation was connected with the hanging of Ellis. In his autobiography he denied this was the case:

At the execution of Ruth Ellis no untoward incident happened which in any way appalled me or anyone else, and the execution had absolutely no connection with my resignation seven months later. Nor did I leave the list, as one newspaper said, by being arbitrarily taken off it, to shut my mouth, because I was about to reveal the last words of Ruth Ellis. She never spoke.

Pierrepoint&#x27;s autobiography does not give any reasons for his resignation—he states that the Prison Commissioners asked him to keep the details private. The Home Office contacted the Sheriff of Lancashire, who paid Pierrepoint the full fee of £15 for his services, but he was adamant that he was still retiring. He had received an offer for £30,000 to £40,000 from the &quot;Empire News and Sunday Chronicle&quot; to publish weekly stories about his experiences. The Home Office considered prosecuting him under the Official Secrets Act 1939, but when two of the stories appeared that contained information that contradicted the recollections of other witnesses, they did not do so. Instead pressure was put on the publishers who stopped the stories.
Pierrepoint and his wife ran their pub until they retired to the seaside town of Southport in the 1960s. In 1974 he published his autobiography, &quot;Executioner: Pierrepoint&quot;. He died on 10 July 1992, aged 87, in the nursing home where he had lived for the last four years of his life.

==Views on capital punishment==
In his 1974 autobiography, Pierrepoint changed his view on capital punishment, and wrote that hanging:

... is said to be a deterrent. I cannot agree. There have been murders since the beginning of time, and we shall go on looking for deterrents until the end of time. If death were a deterrent, I might be expected to know. It is I who have faced them last, young lads and girls, working men, grandmothers. I have been amazed to see the courage with which they take that walk into the unknown. It did not deter them then, and it had not deterred them when they committed what they were convicted for. All the men and women whom I have faced at that final moment convince me that in what I have done I have not prevented a single murder.

In a 1976 interview with BBC Radio Merseyside, Pierrepoint expressed his uncertainty towards the sentiments, and said that when the autobiography was originally written, &quot;there was not a lot of crime. Not like there is today. I am now honestly on a balance and I don&#x27;t know which way to think because it changes every day.&quot; Pierrepoint&#x27;s position as an opponent of capital punishment was questioned by his long-time former assistant, Syd Dernley, in his 1989 autobiography, &quot;The Hangman&#x27;s Tale&quot;:

Even the great Pierrepoint developed some strange ideas in the end. I do not think I will ever get over the shock of reading in his autobiography, many years ago, that like the Victorian executioner James Berry before him, he had turned against capital punishment and now believed that none of the executions he had carried out had achieved anything! This from the man who proudly told me that he had done more jobs than any other executioner in English history. I just could not believe it. When you have hanged more than 680 people, it&#x27;s a hell of a time to find out you do not believe capital punishment achieves anything!

==Approach and legacy==
Pierrepoint described his approach to hanging in his autobiography. He did so in what Lizzie Seal, a reader in criminology, calls &quot;quasi-religious language&quot;, including the phrase that a &quot;higher power&quot; selected him as an executioner. When asked by the Royal Commission about his role, he replied that &quot;It is sacred to me&quot;. In his autobiography, Pierrepoint describes his ethos thus:

I have gone on record ... as saying that my job is sacred to me. That sanctity must be most apparent at the hour of death. A condemned prisoner is entrusted to me, after decisions have been made which I cannot alter. He is a man, she is a woman, who, the church says, still merits some mercy. The supreme mercy I can extend to them is to give them and sustain in them their dignity in dying and death. The gentleness must remain.

Brian Bailey highlights Pierrepoint&#x27;s phrasing relating to hangings; the autobiography reads &quot;I had to hang Derek Bentley&quot;, &quot;I had to execute John Christie&quot; and &quot;I had to execute Mrs Louisa Merrifield&quot;. Bailey comments that Pierrepoint &quot;never had to hang anybody&quot;.

The exact number of people executed by Pierrepoint has never been established. Bailey, in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, and Leonora Klein, one of his biographers, state it was over 400; Steven Fielding, another biographer, puts the figure at 435—based on the Prison Execution Books held at The National Archives; the obituarists of &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; put the figure at 17 women and 433 men. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; puts the figure at 530 people, &quot;The Independent&quot; considers the figure to be 530 men and 20 women, while the BBC states it is &quot;up to 600&quot; people.

In addition to his 1974 autobiography, Pierrepoint has been the subject of several biographies, either focusing on him or alongside other executioners. These include &quot;Pierrepoint: A Family of Executioners&quot; by Fielding, published in 2006, and Leonora Klein&#x27;s 2006 book &quot;A Very English Hangman: The Life and Times of Albert Pierrepoint&quot;. There have been several television and radio documentaries about or including Pierrepoint, and he has been portrayed on stage and screen, and in literature.

On Pierrepoint&#x27;s resignation, two assistant executioners were promoted to lead executioner: Jock Stewart and Harry Allen. Over the next seven years they carried out the remaining thirty-four executions in the UK. On 13 August 1964 Allen hanged Gwynne Evans at Strangeways Prison in Manchester for the murder of John Alan West; at the same time, Stewart hanged Evans&#x27;s accomplice, Peter Allen, at Walton Gaol in Liverpool. They were the last hangings in English legal history. The following year the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 was passed, which imposed a five-year moratorium on executions. The temporary ban was made permanent on 18 December 1969.

==Etymology==
The city is named after the Opava River. The name of the river arose from the old Celtic words &quot;apa&quot;, &quot;opa&quot;, i.e. &#x27;water&#x27;.

==Geography==
Opava is located about northwest of Ostrava. Most of its territory lies in the Opava Hilly Land within the Silesian Lowlands, but it also extends to the Nízký Jeseník range in the southeast and northwest. The highest point of the municipal territory is Hůrka at above sea level.

Opava is situated at the confluence of the Opava and Moravice rivers. The Opava River flows through the city centre.

Stříbrné Lake is an artificial lake on the outskirts of the city created by the flooding of the former gypsum quarry. It is used for recreational purposes.

==History==
The first written mention of Opava is from 1195. In 1224, Opava received town privileges. After the Duchy of Troppau was established, Opava became its capital.

In 1427–1431, the duchy was ruled by the Hussites. In 1485, it was acquired by Matthias Corvinus and ruled by the Hungarians until 1526. In 1613, Karl I of Liechtenstein became Duke of Opava and merged the duchy with the Duchy of Krnov.

After the majority of Silesia was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia during the War of the Austrian Succession after 1740, the remaining Silesian territory still under the control of the Habsburg monarchy became known as Austrian Silesia, with its capital in Opava (1742–1918). The Congress of Troppau took place here from 24 October to 23 December 1820.

According to the Austrian census of 1910, the town had 30,762 inhabitants, 29,587 of whom had permanent residence there. The census asked people for their native language, which showed that 27,240 (92%) were German-speaking, 2,039 (6.9%) were Czech-speaking and 274 (0.9%) were Polish-speaking. Jews were not allowed to declare Yiddish, and most of them thus declared German as their native language. The main religious group was Roman Catholics with 28,379 (92.2%), followed by Protestants with 1,155 (3.7%) and Jews with 1,112 (3.6%).

After the defeat of Austria-Hungary in World War I, Opava became part of Czechoslovakia in 1919.

In 1938, Opava was ceded to Nazi Germany as a result of the Munich agreement. It was administered as a part of Reichsgau Sudetenland. On 22 April 1945, Opava was liberated by the Soviet Red Army at the cost of enormous war damage. In 1945–1946, the German population was expelled under terms of Beneš decrees and the city was resettled with Czechs. On 1 January 1946, the municipalities of Jaktař, Kateřinky and Kylešovice were joined to Opava. After the war, entire new residential areas and industrial plants were built.

While the Duchy of Opava has ceased to exist, the title of Duke of Troppau continues, with Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein being the current incumbent.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
Opava is home especially to the engineering, food, paper and pharmaceutical industries. The largest company is Teva Czech Industries, a manufacturer of medicinal products, whose predecessor was founded in Opava in 1883. It employs about 1,600 people.

The largest non-industrial employers are the hospital and the psychiatric hospital.

==Culture==

Opava is an important cultural centre of Opavian Silesia. The Silesian Theatre in Opava was founded in 1805.

==Education==

Opava is home to the Silesian University, the only public university in the country not situated in a regional capital. It was established in 1991.

==Sport==
The city&#x27;s football club SFC Opava currently plays in the Czech National Football League, the second tier of the Czech football league system.

==Sights==
One of the two main landmarks of Opava is the city hall on the Horní Square and its white tower, known as Hláska. A one-storey city hall and the tower were built in 1614–1618. However, the less representative town hall building around the tower was demolished in 1902 and replaced with a new one in the Neo-Renaissance style.

The second main landmark is the Co-Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. It is the largest building in the Czech Republic built in the so-called Silesian Brick Gothic style. A solid prismatic tower was built in the late 13th century and a higher south tower was built in the early 14th century, both towers were originally intended as part of a city hall. The church building between the towers dates from the mid-14th century. In 1996, the church became the second Episcopal church of the Ostrava-Opava diocese, and therefore a co-cathedral. With , the southern church tower is the highest tower in Silesia.

There are three monuments, protected as national cultural monuments of the Czech Republic. Besides the co-cathedral, there is the Chapel of the Holy Cross, which dates from 1394, and the Petr Bezruč City House of Culture; a Neo-Renaissance house, built in 1908–1910 according to the design by Leopold Bauer.

The Silesian Museum, founded in 1814, is the oldest public museum in the Czech Republic. It has about 2,400,000 exhibition items and is the third largest museum in the country.

<doc id="242470" wikidata="Q392661" url="?curid=242470" title="Luke McShane">
<text>Luke James McShane (born 7 January 1984) is an English chess player. A chess prodigy, he was awarded the title of Grandmaster by FIDE in 2000, at the age of 16. McShane has become one of England&#x27;s leading players and a member of the national team. He also worked as a trader in London&#x27;s financial sector, and has previously been described as the world&#x27;s strongest amateur chess player.

== Early career ==

McShane won the World Under 10 Championship in Duisburg at the age of eight. Shortly afterwards he found a sponsor in the form of computer company Psion and played Garry Kasparov at a simultaneous exhibition in 1995. At sixteen he became the youngest ever Briton to achieve the title Grandmaster, gaining the three results required (&quot;norms&quot;) in tournaments in Germany, Iceland and the Politiken Cup in Copenhagen, Denmark. He held the record until David Howell broke it in January 2007. In January 2004 McShane was ranked second in the world among junior (under 21) players behind Teimour Radjabov.

== Grandmaster ==
Among McShane&#x27;s more notable results are joint first in the 1998 Bunratty Masters in Ireland with John Nunn, winning five of his six games, and joint winner with Stuart Conquest and Bogdan Lalić of the Iona Technologies International Masters in Kilkenny. McShane led the 2002 British Championship in Torquay, and was in a good position in the final round before blundering and losing to the tournament&#x27;s winner, Ramachandran Ramesh. McShane finished tied for fourth.

From around 2002, McShane has been facing stiffer opposition, including players from the world&#x27;s top ten. He played for England in the Chess Olympiad in Bled, scoring 6½/11 points, and won the silver medal at the World Junior Championship in Goa. In 2003 he finished fifth in the Hrokurinn tournament in Reykjavík, finishing ahead of Britain&#x27;s number one player Michael Adams and drawing games against Viktor Korchnoi and Alexei Shirov. Shortly afterwards, he beat Shirov in a Reykjavík blitz tournament. In the 2003 Sigeman &amp; Co tournament in Malmö, he finished third with a score of 5½/9, drawing his game with the tournament winner, Vasily Ivanchuk. Also in 2003, McShane finished 27th out of 207 with 8/13 in the European Individual Championship in Silivri in Turkey, 1½ points behind the winner, Zurab Azmaiparashvili. Shortly afterwards he tied for first with Alexei Dreev and Krishnan Sasikiran in the North Sea Cup played in Esbjerg in Denmark with 6½/9, finished tied for second in the Politiken Cup in Copenhagen with 8½/11 and won the Malmö Masters with 7½/9, a point and a half ahead of his nearest rival. In 2009/10 he tied for first through fifth place with Eduardas Rozentalis, Pavel Ponkratov, Radosław Wojtaszek and Igor Lysyj at the 39th Rilton Cup in Stockholm. In 2010 he won the third Remco Heite tournament in Wolvega.

McShane is a strong blitz chess player. He won the 136-player Kuppenheim tournament in 2003 ahead of Vladimir Epishin and former German blitz champion Robert Rabiega, finishing with a score of 50½/53 points. In this tournament he played his games over the Internet, while all other participants were in the playing hall in Germany. In 2003 he won the British Blitz Championship held at Uxbridge with a score of 14½/16 and the Greenland Open rapid tournament with 8½/9.

In 2009 and 2010 McShane participated in the London Chess Classic. He finished mid-table at the tournament&#x27;s inaugural showing and took the best game prize for his win against Hikaru Nakamura. The 2010 tournament included Viswanathan Anand (reigning world chess champion), Magnus Carlsen (rated number one for most of 2010) and Vladimir Kramnik (former world champion). Under a scoring system of 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss, McShane finished joint second with Anand, behind Carlsen, whom McShane had beaten in their individual encounter, and ahead of Kramnik. Undefeated, his event performance rating was 2838 – higher than Carlsen&#x27;s or Anand&#x27;s. In the January 2011 rating list, he briefly topped Nigel Short to become the UK&#x27;s second highest ranked player after Michael Adams.

In January 2011 McShane came joint first with David Navara in the &#x27;B group&#x27; of the Tata Steel tournament, winning on tie break and qualifying, with Navara, for the 2012 &#x27;A group&#x27; but did not play, owing to work commitments.

McShane participated in the Tal Memorial in Moscow in June 2012. Seeded in last place, he beat Levon Aronian, then the world ranked number two, in a game where he sacrificed the exchange for the initiative. He then followed up with wins against Alexander Morozevich and Vladimir Kramnik, his combative performances rewarding voters of the online poll responsible for securing his wildcard place, ahead of Alexei Shirov and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov. However, he finished last but one (tied eighth), after losing to Magnus Carlsen, Fabiano Caruana, Teimour Radjabov and Alexander Grischuk.

McShane was particularly active in the USA during 2015. In June, he won the (Arlington) DC International with 7/9. The following month, he finished the World Open on 6½/9, a half-point behind the leading group. In October, he returned for the Las Vegas Millionaire Chess event, and narrowly failed to qualify for the knockout phase, but completed the Open event with 7/9, leaving him tied equal first with Wesley So, Fabiano Caruana and Evgeniy Najer.

He was booked to give a simultaneous display at the 2015 London Chess Classic, but also entered two of the Festival events. The first was the inaugural British Knockout Championship, where he was eliminated by Nick Pert in the semi-final. At the Super Rapidplay Open, in a field that included 33 grandmasters, he was the winner with 9½/10, a full point clear of second place.

In Katowice 2017, he took the silver medal at the European Blitz Championship, with a score of 17½/22, a half-point behind Sergei Zhigalko. McShane&#x27;s finish placed him ahead of the highly rated Jan-Krzysztof Duda and David Navara, with the total number of participants being in excess of one thousand.

McShane participated in the 2019 World Team Championship, held in Astana, as a member of the English team. England took the silver medal and he also won the individual gold on board two.

== Education and part-time status ==
McShane attended Westminster Under School and then City of London School, before entering Oxford University in 2003, where he read philosophy and mathematics at University College. In the summer of 2006 he interned at Goldman Sachs in FICC. After graduating in the summer of 2007, he worked there as a trader. A brief increase in his chess activity occurred when he subsequently left his job, but he was forced to decline his invitation to the 2011 British Championship when he later returned to full-time employment. He continues to play in a reduced capacity and has been referred to as the world&#x27;s strongest amateur.

== Columnist ==
McShane has been the chess columnist of &quot;The Spectator&quot; since October 2019.

<doc id="242476" wikidata="Q311278" url="?curid=242476" title="Jack Straw">
<text>John Whitaker Straw (born 3 August 1946) is a British politician who served in the Cabinet from 1997 to 2010 under the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He held two of the traditional Great Offices of State, as Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001, and Foreign Secretary from 2001 to 2006 under Blair. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Blackburn from 1979 to 2015.

Straw was born in Essex and privately educated both at Oaklands School, where his mother worked as a teacher, and later at Brentwood School. He studied Law at the University of Leeds before having a career as a barrister. He served as an adviser to cabinet minister Barbara Castle and was selected to succeed her as MP for the Blackburn constituency when she stood down at the 1979 general election.

From 2007 to 2010, he served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and the Secretary of State for Justice throughout the Brown ministry. Straw is one of only three individuals to have served in Cabinet continuously during the Labour governments from 1997 to 2010, the others were Brown and Alistair Darling. After the Labour Party lost power in the 2010 general election, he briefly served as Shadow Deputy Prime Minister and Shadow Secretary of State for Justice, with the intention of standing down from the frontbench after the subsequent 2010 Labour Party Shadow Cabinet election.

==Early life==
Straw was born in Buckhurst Hill in Essex, the son of (Walter) Arthur Whitaker Straw—an insurance clerk and salesman and former industrial chemist born at Worsbrough near Barnsley, and raised in Woodford Green—and Joan Sylvia Gilbey, a teacher at the independent Oaklands School, whose father was a Loughton bus mechanic and shop steward, and who was distantly related to the gin-making family. After his father (with whom, by the time of his death, Straw and his siblings were reconciled) left the family, Straw was raised by his mother on a council estate in Loughton. Known to his family as John, he started calling himself Jack while in school, in reference to Jack Straw, one of the leaders of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381. Straw is of 1/8th Jewish descent (his maternal grandfather&#x27;s mother came from an Eastern European Jewish family). He himself is a Christian.

Straw was educated at the school at which his mother taught, Oaklands, and when she left there, at Staples Road Primary School, Loughton, then Brentwood School and the University of Leeds. He graduated with a second class degree in Law. He was alleged by the Foreign Office to have disrupted a student trip to Chile to build a youth centre. They branded him a &quot;troublemaker acting with malice aforethought&quot;.

Straw was then elected president of the Leeds University Union, during which time he reluctantly supported a sit-in lasting four days in June 1968. At the 1967 National Union of Students (NUS) Conference, he unsuccessfully ran for office in the NUS. In April 1968 he stood unsuccessfully for election as NUS President, but was defeated by Trevor Fisk. However, he was elected as NUS President in 1969, holding this post until 1971. In 1971, he was elected as a Labour councillor in the London Borough of Islington, a position he held until 1978.

Straw qualified as a barrister at Inns of Court School of Law, practising criminal law for two years from 1972 to 1974. He is a member of The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple and remains active in lecturing to fellow members and students. Between 1971 and 1974, Jack Straw was a member of the Inner London Education Authority, and Deputy Leader from 1973 to 1974. He served as a political adviser to Barbara Castle at the Department of Social Security from 1974 to 1976, and as an adviser to Peter Shore at the Department for the Environment from 1976 to 1977. From 1977 to 1979, Straw worked as a researcher for the Granada TV series &quot;World in Action&quot;.

==Early parliamentary career (1979–1997)==
Straw stood unsuccessfully as the Labour parliamentary candidate for the safe Conservative Tonbridge and Malling constituency in the February 1974 election. In 1977, he was selected to stand for Labour in its safe Blackburn seat at the subsequent general election, after Barbara Castle decided not to seek re-election there. He won the seat at the 1979 general election.

Straw&#x27;s first Shadow Cabinet post was as Shadow Education Secretary from 1987 to 1992 and he briefly served as Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment under John Smith from 1992 to 1994. When Tony Blair became leader following Smith&#x27;s death, he chose Straw to succeed him as Shadow Home Secretary. Like Blair, Straw believed Labour&#x27;s electoral chances had been damaged in the past by the party appearing to be &quot;soft on crime&quot;, and he developed a reputation as being even more authoritarian than the Conservative Home Secretary Michael Howard. Straw garnered particular attention for comments condemning &quot;aggressive beggars, winos and squeegee merchants&quot; and calling for a curfew on children.

==Home Secretary (1997–2001)==
Appointed as Home Secretary following the 1997 general election, he brought forward the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, increased police powers against terrorism and proposed to remove the right to trial by jury in certain cases. These policies won praise from Margaret Thatcher who once declared &quot;I would trust Jack Straw&#x27;s judgement. He is a very fair man.&quot; They were deemed excessively authoritarian by his former students&#x27; union, which in 2000 banned him from the building—a policy which lapsed in 2003. However, he also incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, finalising the &quot;de jure&quot; abolition of the death penalty with the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998.

=== Hillsborough and Macpherson Inquiries ===
In June 1997, Straw appointed Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to conduct a review of the need for a new public inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster. He indicated to the judge at the outset that in the view of his officials &quot;there was not sufficient evidence to justify a new inquiry&quot;. In contrast he had told parliament &quot;I am determined to go as far as I can to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked and that we do not reach a final conclusion without a full and independent examination of the evidence.&quot; He had given the families of the victims full assurance that he intended a thorough examination of the matter.
He apologised in both 2012 and 2016 for the failures of his review.

On 31 July 1997, Straw ordered a public inquiry, to be conducted by Sir William Macpherson and officially titled &quot;The Inquiry into the Matters Arising from the Death of Stephen Lawrence&quot;. Its report, produced in February 1999, estimated that it had taken &quot;more than 100,000 pages of reports, statements, and other written or printed documents&quot; and concluded that the original Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) investigation had been incompetent and that officers had committed fundamental errors, including: failing to give first aid when they reached the scene; failing to follow obvious leads during their investigation; and failing to arrest suspects. The report found that there had been a failure of leadership by senior MPS officers and that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman Report, compiled following race-related riots in Brixton and Toxteth, had been ignored and concluded that the force was &quot;institutionally racist&quot;. It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence; this became law in 2005. Straw commented in 2012 that ordering the inquiry was &quot;the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary&quot;.

=== Electoral reform and legislation ===
As Home Secretary, Straw was also involved in changing the electoral system for the European Parliament elections from plurality to proportional representation. In doing so, he advocated the use of the D&#x27;Hondt formula on the grounds that it produces the most proportional outcomes. The d&#x27;Hondt formula, however, is less proportional than the Sainte-Laguë formula which was proposed by the Liberal Democrats. Straw later apologised to the House of Commons for his misleading comments, but the d&#x27;Hondt formula stayed in place.

In 1998, Straw declined to pardon the Pendle Witches, hanged in 1612 for committing murder by witchcraft. Defending the decision, his representative stated that it could not be proved that they were innocent of the crime with which they were charged.

In March 2000, Jack Straw was responsible for allowing former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile. There were requests from several countries for Pinochet to be extradited and face trial for crimes against humanity. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain while appealing the legal authority of the Spanish and British courts to try him, but Straw eventually ordered his release on medical grounds before a trial could begin, and Pinochet returned to Chile.

The Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal continued at this time, and according to the &quot;Telegraph&quot;, Straw had highlighted the problem four years prior to the Jay report being published, saying there was a &quot;specific problem&quot; in some areas of the country where Pakistani men &quot;target vulnerable young white girls&quot;. White girls were, he said, viewed as &quot;easy meat&quot;.

Also in 2000, Straw turned down an asylum request from a man fleeing Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government, stating &quot;we have faith in the integrity of the Iraqi judicial process and that you should have no concerns if you haven&#x27;t done anything wrong.&quot;

He worried, along with William Hague, about the possibility of English nationalism: &quot;As we move into this new century, people&#x27;s sense of Englishness will become more articulated and that&#x27;s partly because of the mirror that devolution provides us with and because we&#x27;re becoming more European at the same time.&quot;

==Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary (2001–2006)==

Straw was appointed Foreign Secretary in 2001 to succeed Robin Cook. Within months, Straw was confronted by the September 11 attacks in the United States. He was initially seen as taking a back seat to Tony Blair in Her Majesty&#x27;s Government&#x27;s prosecution of the &quot;war against terrorism&quot;. In late September 2001, he became the first senior British government minister to visit Iran since the 1979 Revolution.
=== War on terror ===
Following the 9/11 attacks, Straw immediately condemned the attacks and supported the Bush administration&#x27;s interventionist policy in the war on terror, arguing these actions were necessary to dismantle terrorist networks and prevent future attacks. Straw called for NATO&#x27;s invocation of Article 5, which marked the first time the collective defence clause was activated.

Following 9/11, Straw was involved in the passage of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, which expanded surveillance, counter-terrorism measures and detention of non-British nationals powers at home. However, he later faced scrutiny as reports emerged revealing British intelligence&#x27;s involvement in rendition operations and awareness of detainee mistreatment by US authorities. Despite his claims of ignorance about the extent of these actions, these revelations prompted significant controversy and criticism.

In 2003, the governments of the US and UK agreed a new extradition treaty between them, intended to speed up extradition of terrorist suspects. The provisions of the treaty were enacted in the Extradition Act 2003. The treaty later attracted controversy with opponents alleging it to be one-sided: a British request to the US needed to provide a &quot;prima facie&quot; case against a suspect while a US request to Britain needed only to provide reasonable suspicion for an arrest. There have been a series of causes célèbres involving the treaty, including the NatWest Three who later pleaded guilty to fraud against the US parent company of their employers, and Gary McKinnon who admitted hacking US defence computers. An inquiry into extradition arrangements by retired Judge Sir Scott Baker reported in September 2011 that the treaty was not unbalanced and &quot;there is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the United States&quot;.

=== International affairs ===
In 2002, Straw became concerned over the ethnic conflict during the Gujarat riots in western India, on which he said violence and human rights abuses were carried out without preventing by local authorities, to which he took a personal position in the Britain&#x27;s response by supporting the establishment of an inquiry to investigate the events. His criticised the cause of the riots, which included blaming the then-Chief Minister and later Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not preventing such tensions in a BBC documentary, which was later criticised as &quot;biased&quot; against Modi in 2023.

In 2004, Straw came under criticism for granting asylum to Akhmed Zakayev, a spokesperson for Chechen separatists, whom the Kremlin implicated in the Beslan school siege. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Britain of undermining the anti-terrorist coalition by allowing Zakayev to live in London and use asylum as a shield. The feud over Zakayev&#x27;s extradition intensified, especially after his asylum was granted the previous November, with Russia struggling to present a compelling case. Despite Russian pressure, the British government maintained that extradition required substantial evidence and Straw called Russia&#x27;s declaration to strike terrorist bases globally an &quot;understandable&quot; reaction.

In a letter to &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2004, Straw claimed that Trotskyists &quot;can usually now be found in the City, appearing on quiz shows or ranting in certain national newspapers,&quot; and recommended &quot;&quot;Left-Wing&quot; Communism: An Infantile Disorder&quot; by Vladimir Lenin.

In the 2004 Equatorial Guinea coup attempt, Straw was personally informed months in advance of the plans for the takeover attempt and failed to accomplish the duty under international law of alerting the country&#x27;s government. The involvement of British oil companies in the funding of the coup d&#x27;état, and the changing of British citizens evacuation plans for Equatorial Guinea before the attempt, posed serious challenges for the alleged ignorance of the situation. Later on, British officials and Straw were forced to apologise to &quot;The Observer&quot; after categorically denying they had prior knowledge of the coup plot.

=== Controversy over the Iraq War ===
In the run-up to the 2005 general election, Straw faced a potential backlash from his Muslim constituents over the Iraq War – the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK (MPAC) attempted to capitalise on anti-war sentiment with &#x27;operation Muslim vote&#x27; in Blackburn. The swing to the second placed Conservatives was less than 2%, much lower than the national average; the Liberal Democrat&#x27;s increase in vote share (+12.5%) surpassed Labour&#x27;s loss (−12.1%) . Craig Murray, who had been withdrawn as the ambassador to Uzbekistan, stood against his former boss (Straw was then Foreign Secretary) on a platform opposing the use of information gathered under torture in the &quot;war on terror&quot;; he received a 5% vote share. Straw was re-elected, and following his victory called MPAC an &quot;egregious group&quot;, and criticised their tactics during the election.

At the 2005 Labour Conference, the then Foreign Secretary was heckled by Walter Wolfgang, a German Jew who had suffered persecution under the Nazis, and a prominent Labour Party member. At a point when Straw claimed his support for the invasion of Iraq was solely for the purpose of supporting the Iraqi government, 82-year-old Wolfgang was heard to shout &quot;Nonsense&quot;, and was forcibly removed from the auditorium by several bouncers. The incident gained considerable publicity, with party chairman Ian McCartney initially supporting the right to remove hecklers by force. McCartney, PM Tony Blair and other senior Labour members later issued apologies; Wolfgang was later elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party.

=== Military intervention in Iraq and Middle East policy ===
On 13 October 2005, Straw took questions from a public panel of individuals in a BBC &quot;Newsnight&quot; television special on the subject of Iraq, addressing widespread public concerns about the exit strategy for British troops, the Iraqi insurgency and, inevitably, the moral legitimacy of the war. On several occasions Straw reiterated his position that the decision to invade was in his opinion the right thing to do, but said he did not &#x27;know&#x27; for certain that this was the case. He said he understood why public opinion on several matters might differ from his own—a Newsnight/ICM poll showed over 70% of respondents believed the war in Iraq to have increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Britain, but Straw said he could not agree based on the information presented to him.

In February 2006, Straw attracted publicity after he condemned the publication of cartoons picturing Mohammed in the Danish newspaper &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot;.

Straw voiced concern over the 2006 Lebanon War. Straw warned that Israel&#x27;s military action &quot;could further destabilise the already fragile Lebanese nation&quot;, while noting that &quot;Israel has clear rights to defend itself proportionately&quot;.

In August 2006, it was claimed by William Rees-Mogg in &quot;The Times&quot; that there was evidence that Straw was removed from this post upon the request of the Bush administration, possibly owing to his expressed opposition to bombing Iran. This would be ironic, as Richard Ingrams in &quot;The Independent&quot; wondered whether Straw&#x27;s predecessor as Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, was also removed at Bush&#x27;s request, allowing Straw to become Foreign Secretary in the first place. It has also been alleged that another factor in Straw&#x27;s dismissal was the large number of Muslims amongst his Blackburn constituents, supposedly considered a cause for concern by the US.

==== Iraq Inquiry ====
Straw gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry on 21 January 2010, making him the second member of Tony Blair&#x27;s cabinet to do so. He told the inquiry that the decision to go to war in Iraq had &quot;haunted him&quot; and that it was the &quot;most difficult decision&quot; of his life. He also said that he could have stopped the invasion, had he wanted to.

In July 2017, former Iraqi general Abdulwaheed al-Rabbat launched a private war crimes prosecution, in the High Court in London, asking for Straw, Tony Blair and former attorney general Lord Goldsmith to be prosecuted for &quot;the crime of aggression&quot; for their role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The High Court ruled that, although the crime of aggression was recognised in international law, it was not an offence under UK law, and, therefore, the prosecution could not proceed.

===Rendition and torture allegations===
Despite repeated denials about his complicity in extraordinary rendition—he once dismissed the suggestion of UK involvement in the practice as a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;—Straw had been dogged for years over his alleged leading role in it, with specific accusations about the case of Libyan politician Abdel Hakim Belhadj arising in April 2012. In October 2012, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported on the filing of court papers, which alleged that MI6 alerted Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s intelligence services to the whereabouts of dissidents, co-operated in their rendition, sent officers and detailed questions to assist in their interrogation, and that Straw attempted to conceal this from MPs.

The high court in London agreed in January 2017, against the wishes of the Conservative government, to hear a judicial review against the decision to not prosecute Straw and former head of MI6 Mark Allen in the case of the abduction and alleged torture of Belhadj and his pregnant wife who were abducted in Bangkok in 2004 after a tip-off from MI6 and were held for seven years in Tripoli where, Belhaj alleges, he and his wife were repeatedly tortured. The Crown Prosecution Service had decided in June 2016 to not prosecute any members of the UK government citing a &quot;lack of evidence&quot; and the challenge to that decision resulted in the decision to allow a judicial review.

After a successful action by the Conservative government the high court announced in July 2017 that the judicial review would be held in private and that evidence relating to the defence by the government and security services would neither be made available to Belhaj or his legal team nor made public. Criticising the decision Belhaj was quoted as saying that &quot;I went through a secret trial once before, in Gaddafi&#x27;s Libya. It took about a half hour, and I never saw any of the evidence against me. Later a guard came to my cell and tossed in a red jumpsuit – that was how I found out that the secret court had sentenced me to die&quot; and continued &quot;what kind of a trial will it be if we put in a mountain of evidence and government officials can simply refuse to answer us&quot;. In response, Straw stated that he was opposed to extraordinary rendition and had not been complicit in it.

==Leader of the House of Commons (2006–2007)==

After the Labour Party suffered major defeats in local elections on 4 May 2006, losing 317 seats in balloting for 176 councils, Tony Blair acted the following day with a major reshuffle of his ministers during which he moved Straw from Foreign Secretary to Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal. Straw had apparently requested a break from high ministerial office after serving in two of the four great departments of state for nearly ten years. To lessen the apparent demotion, Blair gave Straw responsibility for House of Lords reform and party funding, issues which had been part of the portfolio of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. In addition, Straw was given the chairmanship of the Constitutional Affairs cabinet committee where he was responsible for attempting to force through a flat-fee charge for Freedom of Information requests.

On 25 March 2007, Straw announced he was to run Gordon Brown&#x27;s campaign for the Labour leadership. This was the first official confirmation the Chancellor would stand.

===2006 debate over veils===

In October 2006, Straw attracted controversy by suggesting to a local newspaper, &quot;The Lancashire Evening Telegraph&quot; (now &quot;The Lancashire Telegraph&quot;), that Muslim women who wear veils that cover their faces (the &quot;niqab&quot;) can inhibit inter-community relations, though he denied the issue was raised for political gain, stating that he had raised it in private circles in the past and it had never progressed beyond discussions. Although he did not support a law banning a woman&#x27;s right to choose to wear the veil, he would like them to abandon it altogether.

Asked whether he would prefer veils to be abolished completely, Straw said: &quot;Yes. It needs to be made clear I am not talking about being prescriptive but with all the caveats, yes, I would rather.&quot; He said that he had asked women visiting his constituency surgeries to consider uncovering their noses and mouths in order to allow better communication. He claimed that no women had ever chosen to wear a full veil after this request.

Straw&#x27;s comments kicked off a wide-ranging and sometimes harshly worded debate within British politics and the media; Straw was supported by some establishment figures and castigated by others, including Muslim groups. There is an ongoing debate within the Muslim community whether the Qur&#x27;an and &quot;hadith&quot; (traditions of Muhammad) require the use of the full face veil. Straw apologised for these comments regarding the veil on 26 April 2010 at a private hustings organised by Engage in the buildup to the 2010 general election.

==Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (2007–2010)==

Straw was appointed Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and Secretary of State for Justice on the first full day of Gordon Brown&#x27;s ministry, 28 June 2007. He was the first Lord Chancellor since the sixteenth century to serve in the role whilst a member of the House of Commons. His appointment meant that he continued to be a major figure in the Labour Government. Only Straw, Brown and Alistair Darling served in the cabinet continuously during Labour&#x27;s 13-year government from 1997 to 2010.

In February 2009, Straw used his authority as Secretary of State for Justice to veto publication of government documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act: in particular, those pertaining to early government meetings held in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003.

Straw represented the government on a controversial edition of &quot;Question Time&quot; on 22 October 2009, against British National Party leader Nick Griffin on his first ever appearance. Griffin&#x27;s first comment was to attack Straw&#x27;s father&#x27;s wartime record, to general disdain. As Griffin claimed that European laws prevented him from explaining his stance on holocaust denial Straw later offered his personal assurance as Secretary of State for Justice, which Griffin declined.

===Ambitions for premiership===
Andrew Thorpe-Apps, writing in &quot;the Backbencher&quot;, states that Straw knew he would be defeated by Gordon Brown in a leadership contest as Brown was &#x27;consumed by this one ambition&#x27;.

===Expenses claims===
Two months after learning that MPs&#x27; expenses were to be made public, Straw admitted to the fees office to using expenses to claim a full council tax bill despite only paying a 50% rate. Straw said he had acted in good faith and had repaid the erroneous claims once he was aware that MPs&#x27; expenses were to be made public. Included with the admission was a cheque for the amount he believed he had overcharged, which itself turned out to have been miscalculated leading Straw to send a further cheque with a note saying &quot;accountancy does not appear to be my strongest suit&quot;.

==Retirement from front-bench politics (2010–present)==
In August 2010, Straw announced his plans to quit his role as Shadow Secretary of State for Justice and move to the backbenches, citing the need for a &#x27;fresh start&#x27; for the Labour Party under a new leader. Straw has since described Gordon Brown&#x27;s leadership as a &quot;tragedy&quot;.

In December 2010, ahead of the 2011 Alternative Vote Referendum, Straw was a signatory to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; arguing in favour of the alternative vote.

In January 2011, Straw caused controversy with comments made on &quot;Newsnight&quot; about Pakistani men. He said &quot;there is a specific problem which involves Pakistani heritage men ... who target vulnerable young white girls.&quot; His comments came after two men of Pakistani origin were convicted of rape in Derby.

In April 2011, Straw was appointed as a consultant to ED&amp;F Man Holdings Ltd, a British company based in London specialising in the production and trading of commodities including sugar, molasses, animal feed, tropical oils, biofuels, coffee and financial services. Commenting on his appointment to ED&amp;F Man on a salary of £30,000 per annum, Straw said, &quot;There are 168 hours in the week, and I will work in Blackburn for a least 60 and maybe sleep for 50. Providing there&#x27;s no conflict, I have long taken the view that I am not against people doing other things. I had two jobs as a minister. I think it&#x27;s really important that politicians are involved with the outside world.&quot;

In late 2011, Straw was appointed to the role of visiting professor to University College London School of Public Policy. He later argued for the abolition of the European Parliament.

On 25 October 2013, Straw announced that he would stand down as an MP at the next election.

=== Allegation of antisemitism ===
In 2013, at a round-table event of the Global Diplomatic Forum at the UK&#x27;s House of Commons, Straw (who has partial Jewish heritage) noted, according to Einat Wilf, a former member of Israel&#x27;s Knesset who was one of the other panelists, that among the main obstacles to peace in the Middle East was the amount of money available to Jewish organisations and AIPAC in the US, which was used to control US policy in the region, an opinion common among opponents of Israel. Another obstacle was Germany&#x27;s &quot;obsession&quot; with defending Israel. Wilf stated: &quot;It was appalling to listen to Britain&#x27;s former foreign secretary. His remarks reflect prejudice of the worst kind... I thought British diplomats, including former ones, were still capable of a measure of rational thought.&quot; Wilf said that she was shocked to hear Straw&#x27;s comments and that she responded in the debate by stressing her view that the origin and cause of the conflict was the Palestinian and Arab refusal to accept Israel&#x27;s legitimacy as a sovereign Jewish state.

The Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland said that Straw&#x27;s comments &quot;echo some of the oldest and ugliest prejudices about &#x27;Jewish power&#x27; and go far beyond mere criticism of Israel.&quot;

Speaking to &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, Straw strongly denied claims that his criticism was antisemitic. In a statement to &quot;The Times of Israel&quot;, Straw did not relate to whether he had said what Wilf alleged he said, but did say that there was no justification in any of his remarks for claims that he was being antisemitic. He pointed out that Wilf did not claim that he had embarked on an antisemitic diatribe, as had been claimed in many of the media reports. He wrote a statement to the Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot;, which was described as follows:

Straw wrote that he had voiced concerns at the seminar over Israel&#x27;s &quot;settlement-building ... on Palestinian land (in East Jerusalem, and the Occupied Territories). This is illegal, as the British Foreign Secretary William Hague has observed and in those terms. I said that this amounted to &#x27;theft&#x27; of Palestinians&#x27; land.&quot; In addition, he said that he advocated at the seminar &quot;a tougher stand on this (and on the related issue of goods exported from the Occupied Territories by Israelis) by the European Union.&quot;

He said that he had pointed out in the past that one of the obstacles to an EU policy on this had been &quot;the attitude of Germany, who for understandable reasons have been reluctant to be out of line with the Government of Israel.&quot;

Responding to the claim by Wilf that he referred to &quot;Jewish money&quot;, Straw said that he had spoken at the seminar of the &quot;Israeli lobby&quot; and &quot;the problems which faced President Obama from AIPAC&quot; and spoke of the way AIPAC spends large sums of money supporting pro-Israeli candidates in American elections.
===Cash for access===
In February 2015, Straw was secretly recorded by journalists from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and Channel 4 News, who posed as representatives of a fictitious Chinese company that wanted to set up an advisory council. Straw was recorded describing how he operated &quot;under the radar&quot; and had used his influence to change EU rules on behalf of a firm which paid him £60,000 a year. Straw voluntarily withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party (but remained a member of the party itself) in February 2015 due to allegations from Channel 4 and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

Straw denied any wrongdoing or any breach of the parliamentary rules and voluntarily referred himself to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party pending the Commissioner&#x27;s inquiry. He told the BBC, &quot;[I have] acted with complete probity and integrity throughout my parliamentary career&quot;. He was exonerated by the Commissioner in September 2015 after a detailed investigation. The Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute, saying that &quot;I have seen nothing which suggests that [Mr Straw&#x27;s] conduct would have merited criticism if the approach made by PMR [the bogus company established by Channel 4] had been genuine.&quot; She said that &quot;the evidence I have seen supports Mr Straw&#x27;s assertions that he &quot;neither exaggerated nor boasted&quot; in what he said to the reporters.&quot;

The Commissioner was sharply critical of Channel 4 and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, saying &quot;if in their coverage of this story, the reporters for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Dispatches&quot;, and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; had accurately reported what was said by these two members [the other was Sir Malcolm Rifkind] in their interviews and measured their words against the rules of the House it would have been possible to avoid the damage that has been done to the lives of these two individuals and those around them and to the reputation of the House.&quot;

Media regulator Ofcom, however, took a different view; it judged in December 2015 that the journalists had investigated a matter of significant public interest and that their presentation had been fair.

==Personal life==
Straw&#x27;s first marriage, in 1968, to teacher Anthea Weston, ended in divorce in 1977. They had a daughter, Rachel, born on 24 February 1976, who died after five days because of a heart defect. On 10 November 1978, he married Alice Perkins, a senior civil servant. In 2006, Straw&#x27;s wife joined the board of the country&#x27;s largest airports operator BAA, shortly before it was taken over by the Spanish firm Ferrovial.

Perkins was Chair of the Post Office during a critical period of the British Post Office scandal, chairing a Post Office sub-committee, codenamed &quot;Project Sparrow&quot;, which has been accused of sacking forensic accountants who had found bugs in the Horizon IT system and seeking to exclude victims from compensation.

The couple have two adult children, Will and Charlotte.

Straw supports his local football team Blackburn Rovers, and was made an honorary vice-president of the club in 1998 by Jack Walker. In October 2015, he was given the Freedom of the Borough of Blackburn with Darwen.

A motion of Leeds University Union Council in 2000 revoked Jack Straw&#x27;s life membership of the Union and removed his name from the Presidents&#x27; Board, citing his support for &quot;the asylum and immigration bill&quot; and for limits to trial by jury and legal aid. In 2007, the Union Council reinstated his life membership and place on the Presidents&#x27; Board.

<text>Jinong () was a title of the Mongols. It was derived from Chinese &quot;Jinwang&quot; (, a title for crown prince, similar to Prince of Wales) although some historians have suggested it originates from &quot;Qinwang&quot; (). Whatever its relation with the Chinese title, the Mongol title was rendered in Chinese as &quot;jinong&quot; () or &quot;jinang&quot; ().

The title of Jinong was first given to Kamala, a grandson of Kublai Khan in 1292. He served the mausoleum of Genghis Khan. Those who served the mausoleum were called the Ordus and Jinong came to mean the highest priest of the portable mausoleum. The Ordus lived on the Kherlen River but later moved to the area now known as Ordos. After Dayan Khan, whose father was the Jinong, unified the Mongolian Plateau, his descendants assumed the position until 1949. During the Qing dynasty the Jinong also served as the chief of the Yeke Juu League () or a banner in it.

<text>SABCA () is a Belgian aerospace company. Its main sectors of activity are civil aviation, space and defence.

SABCA was established during 1920. Presently, it is owned by the Belgian group Orizio, itself owned by the Société Fédérale de Participations et d&#x27;Investissement (SFPIM) (a Belgian federal holding) and Sabena Aerospace.

==History==
During 1920, SABCA was founded with the purpose of locally designing and building aircraft to satisfy Belgium&#x27;s emerging aviation requirements. Its first manufacturing site was adjacent to Haren Airport, in the suburbs of Brussels. During the Interwar period, the company produced a number of in-house designs, as well as engaging in the manufacture of both civil and military aircraft. Throughout its existence, SABCA has been a prolific user of production licenses, which have authorised the firm to build other manufacturers&#x27; aircraft. During 1926, the company constructed a total 15 Airco DH.4 light bombers.

While its operations were disrupted by the German occupation of Belgium during the Second World War, SABCA resumed operations shortly following the end of the conflict. In 1955, a new manufacturing plant was opened at Charleroi Airport. Around this same period, SABCA became involved in early European space programmes; the firm would be involved in the production of Spacelab as well as both the Ariane and Vega expendable launch systems. SABCA also cooperated with the Dutch manufacturer Fokker in the manufacture of its F27 Friendship and 50 short-haul airliners. Other civil programmes the firm was involved with include producing elements of the Dassault Mercure and VFW-Fokker 614 airliners.

Throughout the postwar era, the company was involved in the manufacturing of large numbers of licensed aircraft as well as associated upgrade programmes; such aircraft included the Hawker Hunter, the Republic F-84 Thunderjet, the Lockheed F-104G Starfighter, the Dassault Mirage 5, and the AgustaWestland AW109 helicopter. During the 1970s and 1980s, SABCA was responsible for operating one of the two European production lines for the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon; a total of 164 aircraft would be manufactured at its Gosselies facility. The European co-production initiative was officially launched on 1 July 1977; under this arrangement, Fokker-produced components were delivered to General Dynamics&#x27; Fort Worth facility for fuselage assembly, which were then shipped back to Europe for final assembly of the aircraft at the SABCA&#x27;s facility; deliveries to the Belgian Air Force started in January 1979. During the following year, SABCA commenced deliveries to the Royal Norwegian Air Force.

During 1989, SABCA&#x27;s involvement in the civil aviation sector received a significant boost via the first risk-sharing contract with the multinational aerospace conglomerate Airbus. It has since been a participant in all Airbus programmes, including the A380, the A400M Atlas, and the A350 XWB. SABCA also designs and manufactures subassemblies on behalf of other manufacturers, including Dassault Aviation and Gulfstream Aerospace. During 1992, demand for composite components had grown to the point where a dedicated subsidiary, &quot;SABCA Limburg&quot;, was established to focus specifically on this activity.

<text>Jack Straw (probably the same person as &quot;John Rakestraw&quot; or &quot;Rackstraw&quot;) was one of the three leaders (together with John Ball and Wat Tyler) of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381, a major event in the history of England.

==Biography==
Little is known of the revolt&#x27;s leaders. It has been suggested that Jack Straw may have been a preacher. Some have argued that the name was in fact a pseudonym for Wat Tyler or one of the other peasants&#x27; leaders; all of them appear to have used pseudonyms, adding to the confusion.

Several chroniclers, including Henry Knighton, mention Straw, though Knighton erroneously confuses him with Tyler.
Thomas Walsingham stated that Straw was a priest and was the second-in-command of the rebels from Bury St Edmunds and Mildenhall. This story is most likely a result of confusion with a John Wrawe, an unbeneficed priest who was formerly the vicar of Ringsfield near Beccles in Suffolk, and who seems to have led the Suffolk insurgency. Walsingham also states that Straw and his followers murdered both notable local figures in Bury and, after reaching the capital, several of its Flemish residents, an accusation also made by Froissart. However, according to information in the church of St Mary in Great Baddow, in Essex, England, Jack Straw led an ill-fated crowd from the churchyard there to the risings, and he is elsewhere referred to as the leader of the men from Essex (as opposed to Tyler, who led the rebels from Kent).

Straw is generally supposed to have been executed in 1381 along with the other main figures of the Revolt. Froissart states that after Wat Tyler&#x27;s death at Smithfield, Straw (along with John Ball) was found &quot;in an old house hidden, thinking to have stolen away&quot;, and beheaded. Walsingham gives a lengthy (and most likely invented) confession in which Straw states that the insurgents&#x27; plans were to kill the king, &quot;all landowners, bishops, monks, canons, and rectors of churches&quot;, set up their own laws, and set fire to London.

The later chronicles of Raphael Holinshed and John Stow, in addition to detailing the confession, repeat a story, originating in the 15th-century account of Richard Fox, that Jack Straw, alias John Tyler, was provoked into his actions by an assault perpetrated on his daughter by a tax collector.

==Jack Straw in English culture==

Whether Straw was a real person, a pseudonym for Tyler, or simply a result of confusion on the part of chroniclers remote from the events they were describing, he went on to become a part of the popular narrative of the revolt.
Jack Straw and the other rebel leaders are introduced in John Gower&#x27;s &quot;Vox Clamantis&quot; Book I Chapter XI. The defeat of the rebels is covered in Chapter IXX. Macaulay&#x27;s notes to &quot;Vox&quot; include Thomas Fuller&#x27;s translation of the Chapter XI passage.
Gower&#x27;s lines were parodied by Geoffrey Chaucer. Straw is mentioned in &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Priest&#x27;s Tale&quot; of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, as the leader of a mob targeting foreign workers:

Straw was central to an anonymous 1593 play dramatising the events of the Rising, &quot;The Life and Death of Jack Straw&quot;. In the modern era, the rather confused reporting of events was briefly satirised in Sellar and Yeatman&#x27;s parody of Edwardian-era popular history, &quot;1066 and All That&quot;, stating that the peasants revolted &quot;in several reigns under such memorable leaders as Black Kat, Straw Hat, John Bull and What Tyler?&quot;, with objectives including &quot;to find out [...] which of them was the Leader of the Rebellion&quot;.

Straw was commemorated in the name of a pub on the edge of Hampstead Heath, London, which closed in 2002. The Jack Straw&#x27;s Castle, reputed to be the highest pub in London, took its name from a story that Straw addressed groups of rebels on the Heath from a hay wagon which became known as &quot;Jack Straw&#x27;s Castle&quot;.

The British politician Jack Straw (born John Whitaker Straw, 1946) adopted the name &quot;Jack&quot;, allegedly after the rebel leader.

<text>Ramon Berenguer III &quot;the Great&quot; (11 November 1082 – 23 January or 19 July 1131) was the count of Barcelona, Girona, and Ausona from 1086 (jointly with Berenguer Ramon II and solely from 1097), Besalú from 1111, Cerdanya from 1117, and count of Provence in the Holy Roman Empire, from 1112, all until his death in Barcelona in 1131. As Ramon Berenguer I, he was Count of Provence in right of his wife.

==Biography==
Born on 11 November 1082 in Rodez, Viscounty of Rodez, County of Toulouse, Francia, he was the son of Ramon Berenguer II. He succeeded his father to co-rule with his uncle Berenguer Ramon II. He became the sole ruler in 1097, when Berenguer Ramon II was forced into exile. 

Responding to increased raids into his lands by the Almoravids in 1102, Ramon counter-attacked, assisted by Ermengol V, Count of Urgell, but was defeated and Ermengol killed at the battle of Mollerussa.

During his rule Catalan interests were extended on both sides of the Pyrenees. By marriage or vassalage he incorporated into his realm almost all of the Catalan counties (except Urgell and Peralada). He inherited the counties of Besalú (1111) and Cerdanya (1117) and in between married Douce, heiress of Provence (1112). His dominions then stretched as far east as Nice.

In alliance with the Count of Urgell, Ramon Berenguer conquered Balaguer. He also established relations with the Italian maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa, and in 1114 and 1115 attacked with Pisa the then-Muslim islands of Majorca and Ibiza. They became his tributaries and many Christian slaves there were recovered and set free. Ramon Berenguer also raided mainland Muslim dependencies with Pisa&#x27;s help, such as Valencia, Lleida and Tortosa. In 1116, Ramon traveled to Rome to petition Pope Paschal II for a crusade to liberate Tarragona. By 1118 he had captured and rebuilt Tarragona, which became the metropolitan seat of the church in Catalonia (before that, Catalans had depended ecclesiastically on the archbishopric of Narbonne).

In 1127, Ramon Berenguer signed a commercial treaty with the Genoese. On 14 July 1130, toward the end of his life, he became an associate member of the Templars. He gave his five Catalan counties to his eldest son Ramon Berenguer IV and Provence to the younger son Berenguer Ramon. 

He died on 23 January/19 July 1131 and was buried in the Santa Maria de Ripoll monastery.

<text>In business, diffusion is the process by which a new idea or new product is accepted by the market. The rate of diffusion is the speed with which the new idea spreads from one consumer to the next. Adoption is the reciprocal process as viewed from a consumer perspective rather than distributor; it is similar to diffusion except that it deals with the psychological processes an individual goes through, rather than an aggregate market process.

==Theories==
There are several theories that purport to explain the mechanics of diffusion:

*The two-step hypothesis – information and acceptance flows, via the media, first to opinion leaders, then to the general population
* Trickle-down fashion – products tend to be expensive at first, and therefore only accessible to the wealthy social strata – in time they become less expensive and are diffused to lower and lower strata.
*The Everett Rogers Diffusion of innovations theory – for any new idea, concept, product or method, there are five categories of adopters:
**Innovators – venturesome, educated, multiple info sources;
**Early adopters – social leaders, popular, educated;
**Early majority – deliberate, many informal social contacts;
**Late majority – skeptical, traditional, lower socio-economic status;
**Laggards – neighbors and friends are main info sources, fear of debt.
*The Chasm model developed by Lee James and Warren Schirtzinger - Originally named The Marketing Chasm, this model overlays Everett Rogers&#x27; adoption curve with a gap between early adopters and the early majority. Chasm theory is only applicable to discontinuous innovations, which are those that impose a change of behavior, new learning, or a new process on the buyer or end user. And the pre-requisite for a chasm or gap to exist in the adoption lifecycle is the innovation must be discontinuous.
*Technology driven models – These are particularly relevant to software diffusion. The rate of acceptance of technology is determined by factors such as ease of use and usefulness.

==Rate==
According to Everett M. Rogers, the rate of diffusion is influenced by:
* The product&#x27;s perceived advantage or benefit.
* Riskiness of purchase.
* Ease of product use – complexity of the product.
* Immediacy of benefits.
* Observability.
* Trialability.
* Price.
* Extent of behavioral changes required.
* Return on investment in the case of industrial products.

===Models===
There are several types of diffusion rate models:
#Penetration models – use test market data to develop acceptance equations of expected sales volume as a function of time. Three examples of penetration models are:
#*Bass trial only model
#*Bass declining trial model
#*Fourt and Woodlock model
#Trial/Repeat models – number of repeat buyers is a function of the number of trial buyers.
#Deterministic models – assess number of buyers at various states of acceptance – later states are determined from calculations to previous states.
#Stochastic models – recognize that many elements of the diffusion process are unknown but explicitly incorporate probabilistic terms.

<doc id="242497" wikidata="Q2729231" url="?curid=242497" title="Jarrow March">
<text>The Jarrow March of 5–31 October 1936, also known as the Jarrow Crusade, was an organised protest against the unemployment and poverty suffered in the English town of Jarrow during the 1930s. Around 200 men, or &quot;Crusaders&quot; as they preferred to be called, marched from Jarrow to London, carrying a petition to the British government requesting the re-establishment of industry in the town following the closure in 1934 of its main employer, Palmer&#x27;s shipyard. The petition was received by the House of Commons but not debated, and the march produced few immediate results. The Jarrovians went home believing that they had failed.

Jarrow had been a settlement since at least the 8th century. In the early 19th century, a coal industry developed before the establishment of the shipyard in 1851. Over the following 80 years, more than 1,000 ships were launched in Jarrow. In the 1920s, a combination of mismanagement and changed world trade conditions following the First World War brought a decline which led eventually to the yard&#x27;s closure. Plans for its replacement by a modern steelworks plant were frustrated by opposition from the British Iron and Steel Federation, an employers&#x27; organisation with its own plans for the industry. The failure of the steelworks plan, and the lack of any prospect of large-scale employment in the town, were the final factors that led to the decision to march.

Marches of the unemployed to London, termed &quot;hunger marches&quot;, had taken place since the early 1920s, mainly organised by the National Unemployed Workers&#x27; Movement (NUWM), a communist-led body. For fear of being associated with communist agitation, the Labour Party and Trades Union Congress (TUC) leaderships stood aloof from these marches. They exercised the same policy of detachment towards the Jarrow March, which was organised by the borough council with the support of all sections of the town but without any connection with the NUWM. During their journey the Jarrow marchers received sustenance and hospitality from local branches of all the main political parties, and were given a broad public welcome on their arrival in London.

Despite the initial sense of failure among the marchers, in subsequent years, the Jarrow March became recognised by historians as a defining event of the 1930s. It helped to foster the change in attitudes which prepared the way to social reform measures after the Second World War, which their proponents thought would improve working conditions. The town holds numerous memorials to the march. Re-enactments celebrated the 50th and 75th anniversaries, in both cases invoking the &quot;spirit of Jarrow&quot; in their campaigns against unemployment. In contrast to the Labour Party&#x27;s coldness in 1936, the post-war party leadership adopted the march as a metaphor for governmental callousness and working-class fortitude.

==National Background==
===Unemployment in Britain between the wars===

In the period immediately after the end of the First World War, Britain&#x27;s economy enjoyed a brief boom. Businesses rushed to replenish stocks and re-establish peacetime conditions of trade and, while prices rose rapidly, wages rose faster and unemployment was negligible. By April 1920 this boom had given way to Britain&#x27;s first post-war slump, which ushered in an era of high unemployment. Britain&#x27;s adoption of generally deflationary economic policies, including a return to the gold standard in 1925, helped to ensure that the percentage of the workforce without jobs remained at around 10% for the rest of the 1920s and beyond, well above the normal pre-war levels. During the world recession that began in 1929 and lasted until 1932, the percentage of unemployed peaked at 22%, representing more than 3 million workers.

Unemployment was particularly heavy in Britain&#x27;s traditional staple export industries—coal mining, shipbuilding, iron and steel and textiles—all of which were in a slow decline from their Victorian heyday. Because of the concentration of these industries in the north of England, in Scotland and in Wales, the percentage of unemployed persons in these regions was significantly higher, sometimes more than double, than in the south throughout the interwar period. The decline of these industries helped to create pockets of long-term unemployment outside the normal cyclical variations. Some workers had no work for years.

===Hunger marches===
In 1921, in reaction to the rising levels of unemployment, the newly formed British Communist Party set up the National Unemployed Workers&#x27; Movement (NUWM). From 1922 until the late 1930s, under its charismatic leader Wal Hannington, the NUWM organised regular marches in which unemployed workers converged on London to confront Parliament, in the belief that this would improve conditions. These became known as &quot;hunger marches&quot;, reviving a name coined by the press in 1908, when a group of London&#x27;s unemployed marched to Hyde Park.

The 1922 marchers sought a meeting with the new prime minister, Bonar Law, who refused to see them because of their undemocratic leadership. The march leaders were denounced in &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;avowed Communists ... who have been identified with disturbances in their own localities&quot;. The Labour Party and the TUC kept aloof, fearful of being tainted by association with the communist organisers. The same pattern was followed with subsequent NUWM marches; successive prime ministers—Stanley Baldwin in 1929, Ramsay MacDonald in 1930 and 1934—declined to meet the marchers&#x27; representatives, and the Labour Party and the TUC continued to keep their distance.

In 1931, MacDonald became head of a Conservative-dominated National Government that imposed a means test on unemployment benefits. Anger at the means test was the rationale for the 1932 hunger march, in which a series of rallies and demonstrations across London broke out into considerable violence; the leaders provoked clashes with opponents and police in Hyde Park, Trafalgar Square and Westminster which led to the arrest and imprisonment of the march&#x27;s leaders. Although women were not allowed to march on the Jarrow march, women&#x27;s contingents were present at other hunger marches across the 1930s. These women, who were often the wives of unemployed men, were often faced with restrictions, such as being forced to stay in workhouses if the local Labour Party would not accommodate them.

Two additional national marches were held in 1934 and 1936. By this time the country had made a substantial recovery from the worst depression years of 1929–32. Unemployment was significantly down, annual growth was averaging 4%, and many parts of the country were enjoying a substantial boom in housing and consumer goods. The increasing prosperity was not uniformly spread, and there were sharp contrasts between economic conditions in the south and those in the north-east, South Wales, Scotland and elsewhere, where the rate of recovery was much slower.

At the same time, the national mood was changing. External factors such as the rise of fascism in Europe helped to unify the British left, and there were more supportive voices in parliament on behalf of the unemployed. The idea of marching as a means of expressing political or social grievances had by now become an accepted and well-established tactic, and there was a growing awareness of the problems complained of, which counterbalanced their exploitation by the Communists. The historian A. J. P. Taylor considered that the hunger marchers had &quot;displayed the failure of capitalism in a way that mere figures or literary description could not. Middle-class people felt the call of conscience&quot;.
==Local background: Jarrow==
===Town history===
Jarrow, situated on the River Tyne in County Durham, northern England, entered British history in the 8th century, as the home of Bede, the early Christian monk and scholar. After Bede, little changed in the remote rural community for a thousand years, although his monastery was dissolved under Henry VIII in the 16th century. The discovery of coal in the 17th century led to major changes. Mining on an industrial scale began in the early 1800s, resulting in the population of Jarrow more than doubling between 1801 and 1821 to around 3,500, largely from the influx of mineworkers.

The town&#x27;s years as a coalfield were unhappy. Living conditions in many of the hastily erected cottages were insanitary, lacking water and drainage. There was a serious outbreak of cholera in Jarrow and northeast England in the winter of 1831–32, as part of an epidemic that spread from Europe and resulted in more than 200 deaths in Newcastle alone. Relations in Jarrow between employer and employee were poor; workers were held by the &quot;bond&quot; system whereby they were tied to a particular employer for a year, whether or not that employer could provide work. 

Working conditions in the mines were dangerous: there were explosions in 1826, 1828 and 1845, each with large loss of life. Attempts by workers to organise into a trade union were fiercely opposed by the employers. Miners conducted lengthy strikes in 1832 and 1844, each ending when hunger forced them back to work. After the easier seams of coal were exhausted, the Jarrow pits became less profitable, and in 1851 the owners abandoned them altogether.

===Shipbuilding===

Jarrow began its development as a shipbuilding town with the establishment in 1851 of Palmer&#x27;s shipyard on the banks of the River Tyne. The first ship from the yard was launched in 1852, an iron-built and steam-powered collier. Many more such carriers followed. In 1856 the yard began building warships, and was soon supplying many of the world&#x27;s navies. With its associated iron and steel works, it became the largest shipbuilding centre in the country, employing thousands of men. Jarrow&#x27;s population, at around 3,800 in 1850, had increased nearly tenfold to 35,000 by 1891. Palmer&#x27;s was central to Jarrow&#x27;s economy, both for the numbers employed there and for the ancillary businesses that served the needs of both the yard and town.

The shipyard generated high employment to Jarrow, but the industrial works created a harsh environment. Ellen Wilkinson, the town&#x27;s historian and member of parliament from 1935 to 1947, quotes a newspaper source from 1858: &quot;There is a prevailing blackness about the neighbourhood. The houses are black, the ships are black, the sky is black, and if you go there for an hour or two, reader, you will be black&quot;. According to Wilkinson, the yard&#x27;s founder, Sir Charles Palmer, &quot;regarded it as no part of his duty to see that the conditions under which his workers had to live were either sanitary or tolerable&quot;.

In the 1890s, Britain held a near monopoly of the world&#x27;s shipbuilding, with a share of around 80%. This proportion fell during the early years of the 20th century to about 60%, as other countries increased their production. Palmer&#x27;s remained busy, and during the years of the First World War built many of Britain&#x27;s warships: the battleship , the light cruiser , and numerous smaller vessels were all built in Jarrow. During the brief postwar boom of 1919–20, orders remained plentiful and Palmer&#x27;s prospered. However, the firm&#x27;s management had not anticipated the conditions that developed in the 1920s when, as Wilkinson says, &quot;every industrial country that had bought ships from Britain was now building for itself&quot;. The firm made over-optimistic assessments of future demand, and invested accordingly. The anticipated demand did not materialise. By the mid-1920s, Palmer&#x27;s was incurring heavy losses, and was close to bankruptcy. It was temporarily reprieved by a short-lived boom in 1929, when orders rose and the town briefly enjoyed the prospect of an economic recovery.

===Closure of Palmer&#x27;s===

On 24 July 1930 Palmer&#x27;s launched its thousandth ship, the tanker &quot;Peter Hurll&quot;. By this time the brief shipbuilding boom had been ended by the Great Depression, and there were no new orders on the firm&#x27;s books. Rumours of impending reorganisation and rationalisation in the industry gave the workforce cause for anxiety, which deepened with the formation in 1930 of National Shipbuilders Security Ltd (NSS). This was a company created by the government to assist shipbuilders by acquiring failing yards and dismantling them, so that production was concentrated within a smaller number of profitable yards. To ensure this rationalisation was sustained, the closed yards were banned from any shipbuilding activity for at least 40 years.

In 1931, NSS was busy closing shipyards elsewhere in the country, while an order from the Admiralty for two destroyers kept Palmer&#x27;s working until mid-1932. The second of these ships, , was the last ship launched from the yard, on 19 July 1932. By this time, Palmer&#x27;s was insolvent, but retained a faint hope of further naval contracts. These failed to materialise, and in June 1933 the firm&#x27;s creditors appointed a receiver. 

By December 1933 rumours of NSS interest in the yard were appearing in the press, and in the House of Commons Walter Runciman, the President of the Board of Trade, told members: &quot;There is nothing to be gained by giving Jarrow the impression that Palmer&#x27;s can be revived&quot;. He continued: &quot;Would it not be very much better to make a clean sweep of that as a shipyard, and throw open to the world for sale what is one of the finest and most convenient sites anywhere in Europe?&quot; Despite efforts by management and workers to find an alternative solution, in the early summer of 1934 NSS acquired the yard, closed it, and began to dismantle its plant. Blythe wrote: &quot;The only sound to compete with the unfamiliar noise of the marsh birds ... was the ring of the breakers&#x27; hammers.&quot;

Following the Palmer&#x27;s closure, a small hope of relief and some industrial resurrection was offered by the industrialist Sir John Jarvis, who held the ceremonial office of High Sheriff of Surrey. He was the prospective Conservative candidate for Guildford. On 4 October 1934, Jarvis announced the &quot;adoption&quot; of Jarrow by the county of Surrey, and promised to bring new industries to the town; he mentioned ship breaking, bottle manufacture and furniture-making. While acknowledging the generous principle behind Jarvis&#x27;s scheme, Betty Vernon, the biographer of Jarrow politician Ellen Wilkinson, described it as ultimately superficial, offering little more than patchwork assistance. Blythe observes: &quot;This excellent man failed, as anyone must fail who tries to play the good squire to a town of nearly forty thousand people&quot;.

===Ellen Wilkinson===

In the 1931 general election, in the nationwide rout of Labour, the Jarrow constituency was won by the National Government&#x27;s candidate, William Pearson, a Conservative borough councillor and former mayor. In 1932, when the mood in Jarrow was desperate—&quot;a workhouse without walls&quot; according to one commentator—the local Labour Party selected Ellen Wilkinson as its parliamentary candidate for the next general election. Wilkinson had helped to found the British Communist Party in 1920, and had a firebrand reputation. She had been associated with Hannington and the NUWM in the early 1920s, but had left the Communist Party in 1923 and had served as Labour MP for Middlesbrough East between 1924 and 1931.

Wilkinson felt a deep bond of sympathy with the people of Jarrow and the loss of the shipyard which was the life-source of the town. Early in 1934 she led a deputation of Jarrow&#x27;s unemployed to meet the prime minister, MacDonald, in his nearby Seaham constituency. She says that at the end of the meeting MacDonald said to her: &quot;Ellen, why don&#x27;t you go out and preach socialism, which is the only remedy for all this?&quot; This &quot;priceless remark&quot;, she says, brought home the &quot;reality and sham ... of that warm but so easy sympathy&quot;.

She became Jarrow&#x27;s MP in the general election of November 1935, when she won the seat with a majority of 2,360. In the opening debate of the new parliamentary session, on 9 December 1935, she pleaded on behalf of her new constituents: &quot;These are skilled fitters, men who have built destroyers and battleships and the finest passenger ships ... The years go on and nothing is done ... this is a desperately urgent matter and something should be done to get work to these areas which, Heaven knows, want work.&quot;

===Proposed steelworks===
While Jarvis&#x27;s palliative measures were being developed, a more substantial project to bring industry back to Jarrow was under consideration. An American entrepreneur, T. Vosper Salt, became aware of the impending sale and break-up of Palmer&#x27;s yard. He was convinced that the world demand for steel was about to rise, and thought that the site, with its ready-made docking and rail facilities, would be ideal for a new, modern steelworks. In January 1934, when an initial feasibility study report had proved favourable, Salt began discussions with the British Iron and Steel Federation (BISF), a steel producers&#x27; organisation formed that year as part of the National Government&#x27;s rationalisation of the iron and steel industry.

The British steel industry was protected from more efficient foreign competition by the government&#x27;s high tariff wall. The BISF, through its control of pricing, could also present a united front against new competition at home. When the feasibility report was received by the BISF in March 1935 the Federation&#x27;s chairman, Sir Andrew Duncan, at first reacted positively. His members from the north-east were rather less enthusiastic. Only one of the large steel firms in the region, the Consett Iron Company, offered support for a Jarrow steelworks, while other BISF members put pressure on London&#x27;s financial institutions to withhold capital from the new scheme. Reports of such tactics caused great anxiety in the Jarrow area, where the people were desperate for the new works to come about. In a reassuring speech shortly before the November 1935 general election, Baldwin, now leading the National Government, informed his listeners in Newcastle: &quot;There is no truth in any of the reports that either the banks or any other authorities ... are making a dead set to prevent anything of the kind being done in the area&quot;.
After the election and the return of the National Government, little happened to support Baldwin&#x27;s optimistic words. In the House of Commons on 2 March 1936, Wilkinson spoke of the &quot;atmosphere of mystery&quot; that surrounded the Jarrow scheme: &quot;Publicly one sees tremendous optimism ... but when you see people privately there is a great deal of humming and ha&#x27;ing, and they are not quite sure&quot;. Meanwhile, the BISF argued that increased steel production should be achieved by expanding capacity in existing facilities, rather than by building new plant. Duncan, in a reversal of his earlier attitude, now opposed the provision of finance for Jarrow which, he felt, might create a precedent that other distressed areas could exploit. The BISF finally succeeded in watering down the scheme to the extent that it became unviable; Salt and his syndicate withdrew, and the scheme was dead, &quot;strangled at birth&quot; according to Wilkinson.

In a series of exchanges in the Commons with Runciman on 30 June, Wilkinson requested in vain that the matter be reconsidered by an independent body, rather than being decided by the BISF. One of the government&#x27;s own negotiators, who had been involved in the project since its early stages, wrote in &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;A system which permits the adjudication on a proposal of national importance ... to be left in the hands of parties whose financial interests may run counter to that project, is not conducive to the enterprising development of the steel industry&quot;.

When, later in the summer, Runciman met workers from Jarrow the deputation encountered, in Wilkinson&#x27;s words, &quot;a figure of ice. Icily correct, icily polite, apparently completely indifferent to the woes of others.&quot; His insistence that &quot;Jarrow must work out its own salvation&quot;, was described by Blythe as &quot;the last straw in official cruelty&quot;; to Wilkinson, the phrase &quot;kindled the town&quot;, and inspired it to action.

After the loss of the steelworks, David Riley, the chairman of Jarrow Borough Council, told a rally of the town&#x27;s unemployed in July 1936: &quot;If I had my way I would organise the unemployed of the whole country ... and march them on London so they would all arrive at the same time. The government would then be forced to listen, or turn the military on us&quot;. The idea of a march was taken up with enthusiasm by the mayor Billy Thompson, by Wilkinson, and by political, commercial and religious groups. It was decided that the march would be a local affair, representing the town, with no political connotations. It would be limited to 200 fit men who would arrive in London at the start of the new parliamentary session on 3 November 1936, when a petition from the town would be presented to the House of Commons.

Riley was appointed chief marshal, with four subcommittees to deal with organisational detail. All the local political parties—Labour, Conservative and Liberal—gave their support, as did the town&#x27;s churches and the business community. Relays of medical students from the Inter-Hospital Socialist Society agreed to accompany the march as medical attendants. A fund was begun, with an initial target of £800, to meet the costs of the march; ultimately, nearly double that amount was raised, locally and on the route. Public meetings were planned for the overnight stops, to publicise the plight of Jarrow and of other areas like it. One marcher explained: &quot;We were more or less missionaries of the distressed areas, [not just] Jarrow&quot;.

On Monday 5 October the marchers, selected from over 1,200 volunteers, attended an ecumenical dedication service in Christ Church, Jarrow, where the blessing was given by James Gordon, the Bishop of Jarrow. This apparent endorsement by a senior cleric gained considerable press attention, but earned a sharp response from Hensley Henson, the Bishop of Durham. Henson, a severe critic of socialism and trade unionism, described the march as &quot;revolutionary mob pressure&quot;, and regretted his colleague&#x27;s association with &quot;these fatuous demonstrations, which are mainly designed in the interest, not of the Unemployed, but of the Labour party&quot;.

As Jarrow&#x27;s representatives prepared to leave, six regional contingents of the sixth National Hunger March were taking the road to London, where they were due to arrive a week after the Jarrow marchers. A group of blind veterans, organised by the National League of the Blind and Disabled, was also on the march, demanding better allowances for the country&#x27;s 67,000 blind persons.

===On the road===

====Week one: Jarrow to Ripon====
After the service of dedication, the marchers left Jarrow Town Hall, cheered on by most of the town and bearing banners announcing themselves as the &quot;Jarrow Crusade&quot;. By the following weekend they had travelled to the cathedral city of Ripon, where they were welcomed by the Bishop of Ripon and a delegation representing local churches. Receptions at the intervening stops had been mixed: lukewarm at Chester-le-Street, warm and friendly from the people in Ferryhill and also from the Conservative-controlled council in Darlington.

Wilkinson had left the march at Chester-le-Street to attend the Labour Party&#x27;s annual conference, taking place in Edinburgh. The conference was not supportive of the march—one delegate criticised Wilkinson for &quot;sending hungry and ill-clad men on a march to London&quot;. The Labour conference&#x27;s negative stance brought angry responses from the marchers; Riley considered that they had been &quot;stabbed in the back&quot;. The marchers were further dismayed to learn that the Ministry of Labour&#x27;s Unemployment Assistance Board had ruled that their benefits would be reduced, since they were unavailable for work should jobs arise.

====Week two: Ripon to Chesterfield====
After a weekend&#x27;s rest, the marchers proceeded to Harrogate. In this solidly Conservative, prosperous town the marchers were greeted warmly by the civic authorities and were fed by the Rotary Club. They were given sleeping quarters by the Territorial Army, a change from the school and church halls, and occasional workhouse accommodation, that was provided at most overnight stops. It was becoming evident that local Conservatives were often as likely to provide practical assistance as Labour, whose local parties were constrained by the attitude of the party&#x27;s national leadership. 

The marchers&#x27; claim that theirs was a unique situation, arising from specific actions, the closing of the shipyard and the blocking of the proposed steelworks, that could be remedied by immediate government action, may also have alienated local working-class communities. Cross-party support was important in maintaining the march&#x27;s non-partisan ethos, a factor that led Riley to refuse a donation of £20 from a communist group, stating: &quot;We are determined at all costs to preserve the non-political character of this Crusade&quot;.

At Harrogate Wilkinson rejoined the march, as it proceeded through southern Yorkshire towards Chesterfield in Derbyshire. The march was attracting wide publicity. In London the government worried that King Edward might exceed his constitutional limits and receive the marchers. The cabinet issued a statement that emphasised the constitutional means for expressing grievances, and condemned marches for causing &quot;unnecessary hardship for those taking part in them&quot;—&quot;crocodile tears&quot;, according to Wilkinson. 

In reaching Chesterfield on 17 October, the marchers had travelled during the week, and were at the approximate half-way point in their journey. That day, the Bishop of Durham was gratified and the marchers correspondingly disappointed, when in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; the Bishop of Jarrow denied that his blessing on the march had indicated his support for the venture. The blessing was, he said an act of Christian duty. In general he believed that such marches should be discouraged. Wilkinson was forgiving of the bishop&#x27;s volte-face, knowing, she later said, &quot;the difficulties he had to face&quot;.

====Week three: Chesterfield to Northampton====

The third week of the march covered the greatest distance of the four weeks—. At Mansfield, the Labour-controlled council defied the national leadership to give the marchers a warm welcome. This was matched by the reception from Nottingham&#x27;s Conservative mayor and councillors, and supplemented by gifts of clothing and underwear from the city&#x27;s manufacturers. At Leicester, the Co-operative Society&#x27;s bootmakers worked through the night without pay, repairing the marchers&#x27; boots. According to some accounts, the marchers presented the vicar of the Church of St Mark, Leicester, with a wooden cross, although Matt Perry, in his history of the Jarrow March, indicates that this cross was donated in 1934 by the national hunger march.

From Leicester the march moved to Market Harborough. This was one of the least welcoming of all the overnight stops. No member of the local council greeted or visited the marchers, and they were forced to spend the night on the stone floor of an unfinished building (the local press later denied that this was so). On Saturday 24 October the marchers reached Northampton, arriving at the same time as the blind group. Wilkinson left to supervise arrangements in London, and would thereafter only participate intermittently until the final day, a week hence.

====Week four: Northampton to London====

The leg on Monday 26 October, from Northampton to Bedford, was the longest daily march—. Of the original contingent, 185 were still on the road, together with 10 replacements. To maintain the timetable for arrival at Marble Arch, the marchers took an extra rest day on Tuesday before marching, in teeming rain, the to Luton.

On 29 October, as the marchers walked from Luton to St Albans, the plight of Jarrow was the subject of exchanges in the House of Commons between Wilkinson and Baldwin. The prime minister drew attention to the recent decrease in Jarrow&#x27;s unemployed, and said: &quot;There is every reason to hope that the revival of industry now in progress in the Tyneside area will result in further opportunities for employment for those still unemployed at Jarrow.&quot; Wilkinson replied that the apparent decrease in Jarrow&#x27;s unemployment figures arose from the amalgamation of the figures of Jarrow with those of neighbouring South Shields, and did not represent an increase in employment. She asked Baldwin whether he would break with tradition and meet a deputation of the marchers; the prime minister declined.

On the penultimate stage, from St Albans to Edgware, as the march neared its end, marchers began to contemplate the return home, and the prospect of &quot;looking out of the window ... knowing that there&#x27;s nothing, nothing at all to do&quot;. On the final day, for the short stretch, large crowds watched the column proceed through the London suburbs towards Marble Arch, marching to the accompaniment of their own mouth-organ band despite relentless rain. On arrival, as their leaders talked to the press, the marchers retired to their overnight accommodation in London&#x27;s East End.

===London===

On Sunday 1 November the marchers proceeded to Hyde Park for a hastily organised public meeting. The Communist Party was holding a general rally in the park against unemployment; Wilkinson records that they &quot;generously gave way for an hour and asked their great audience to swell our Crusade meeting&quot;. The police made an estimate of 3,000 for the crowd, journalist Ritchie Calder, who was present, put the figure at 50,000.

After a day&#x27;s rest, the marchers&#x27; main event on Tuesday was a public meeting in the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street. Among the guest speakers was the Rev. Canon Dick Sheppard, founder of the Peace Pledge Union. He told the marchers: &quot;You have so aroused the conscience of the country that things are bound to happen&quot;. Sir John Jarvis, without prior warning, then revealed plans for a steel tubes mill on the Palmers site. The impression that Jarrow&#x27;s problems could be solved thus, without government action, disconcerted the listening marchers. Wilkinson commented that such plans were in the future, and were no substitute for the town&#x27;s requirement for immediate government intervention.

On Wednesday 4 November Wilkinson presented the Jarrow petition to the House of Commons. With over 11,000 signatures, it asked that &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Government and this honourable House should realise the urgent need that work should be provided for the town without further delay.&quot; In the brief discussion that followed, Runciman said that &quot;the unemployment position at Jarrow, while still far from satisfactory, has improved during recent months&quot;, to which James Chuter Ede, the Labour backbencher representing South Shields, the neighbouring constituency to Wilkinson&#x27;s, replied that &quot;the Government&#x27;s complacency is regarded throughout the country as an affront to the national conscience&quot;.

Blythe summarises the marchers&#x27; anger and disillusionment: &quot;And that was that. The result of three months&#x27; excited preparation and one month&#x27;s march has led to a few minutes of flaccid argument during which the Government speakers had hardly mustered enough energy to roll to their feet&quot;. A &quot;stay-in&quot; strike was briefly proposed, before Wilkinson arranged a meeting with a cross-party group of MPs. The marchers&#x27; case was heard sympathetically; the meeting was warned that, given international uncertainties, they might come to regret the dismantling of an important shipbuilding facility for reasons of private profit. Such statements, according to Wilkinson, made members &quot;distinctly uncomfortable&quot;. The next day the marchers returned by train to Jarrow, where they received an ecstatic welcome from the town.

==Appraisal and legacy==
Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis&#x27;s initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer&#x27;s site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners and , to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Cornelius Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was &quot;a waste of time&quot;, but added that he had enjoyed every step. 

Whalen&#x27;s fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that &quot;[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that&quot;. These views are shared by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; columnist Kevin Maguire who described the march as &quot;a heroic failure&quot;, while Matt Dobson, in &quot;The Socialist&quot;, writes that &quot;out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains&quot;. The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March &quot;helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s&quot;, and thus paved the way to social reform.

Perry observes that &quot;the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association&quot;. Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as &quot;a badge of credibility&quot;. In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march. 

In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group from Jarrow and other towns along the way retraced the route to London. At that time of industrial recession, Jarrow once again had the highest level of unemployment in the country. The 75th anniversary in 2011 was marked by a &quot;March for Jobs&quot;, that drew the ire of a Conservative MP, Robert Goodwill, who noted the high level of withdrawals in its early stages and dismissed it as &quot;an insult to the memory of the Jarrow marchers ... They are not fit to walk in [their] footsteps&quot;.

Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town&#x27;s mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. 

In 1939, Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, &quot;The Town that Was Murdered&quot;. A reviewer for &quot;The Economic Journal&quot; found the book &quot;not quite as polemical as one might have expected&quot;, but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill&#x27;s wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947.
In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released the &quot;Jarrow Song&quot;, which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, &quot;Whistling at the Milestones&quot; (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, &quot;Burning Road&quot; (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march. 

On 29 October 2017, the Tyne Bridge was closed off and was the venue the Freedom on The Tyne Finale. The Freedom on The Tyne Finale was the finale of the 2017 Freedom City festival. The event, promoted by Newcastle University re-enacted many world civil rights stories throughout history. The final event, revolved around the March, the re-enactment was described as a memorable closing to the finale. The town of Jarrow contains several commemorations, including a steel relief sculpture by Vince Rea at the new railway station, a tile mural designed by local schoolchildren, and a bronze sculpture—&quot;The Spirit of the Crusade&quot; by Graham Ibbeson—in the town centre. Buildings and street names bear the names of Wilkinson and Riley. Perry writes that &quot;In Jarrow, landscape and memory have fused together, just as the red hot rivets once fastened great sheets of steel in Palmer&#x27;s Yard.&quot;

<text>The Boys&#x27; Brigade (BB) is an international interdenominational Christian youth organisation, conceived by the Scottish businessman Sir William Alexander Smith to combine drill and fun activities with Christian values. Following its inception in Glasgow in 1883 the BB quickly spread across the United Kingdom, becoming a worldwide organisation by the early 1890s. As of 2018, the Boys&#x27; Brigade claimed 750,000 members in 60 countries.

The BB inspired the formation of other similar brigade organisations serving particular denominations, regions, genders, ideals, other religions or even individual churches, such as the Church Lads&#x27; Brigade (1891), London Diocesan Lads&#x27; Brigade and Church Girls&#x27; Brigade (all Church of England and later amalgamated into the Church Lads&#x27; and Church Girls&#x27; Brigade), the pacifist Boys&#x27; Life Brigade (formed 1899 by the National Sunday School Union with strongest support amongst non-conformist churches), the Girls&#x27; Brigade, the Girls&#x27; Life Brigade, Bolton Boys&#x27; Brigade, Catholic Boys&#x27; Brigade (1894), Baptist Boys&#x27; Brigade and the Jewish Lads&#x27; Brigade (1895), inspiring a whole brigade movement.

==Object, motto and emblem==

The object of the Boys Brigade is &quot;the advancement of Christ&#x27;s kingdom among Boys and the promotion of habits of Obedience, Reverence, Discipline, Self-respect and all that tends towards a true Christian manliness.&quot; Except for the addition of the word &quot;obedience&quot; in 1893, the contents of the object has remained unchanged from the beginning. However, some countries, particularly those which permit girls on their membership roll, have re-worded the object for gender neutrality. For example, in Malaysia, the word &quot;manliness&quot; has been changed to &quot;character&quot;.

When designing the Brigade&#x27;s motto and crest, William Smith referred directly to in the King James Version of the Bible, &quot;Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast...&quot;.

From this verse came the BB motto, &quot;Sure and Stedfast&quot;, retaining the old spelling of the latter word. Today, some parts of the movement (only the UK and the Republic of Ireland) have adopted the modern spelling of &quot;steadfast&quot;, whilst all others continue to use the older spelling.

The crest was originally a plain anchor, bearing the BB motto with a capital &#x27;B&#x27; on either side. Upon the merger between the Boys&#x27; Brigade and the Boys&#x27; Life Brigade in 1926, the red Greek cross was placed behind the anchor to form the current emblem. The cross originally formed part of emblem of the Boys&#x27; Life Brigade.
==BB Vesper==
The BB Vesper is a prayer sung after every BB meeting. Every BB Boy and Officer is expected to know how to sing it.

Lyrics:

&quot;Great God who knowest all our need&quot;

&quot;Bless Thou our watch and guard our sleep.&quot;

&quot;Forgive our sins of thoughts and deed,&quot;

&quot;And in Thy peace Thy servants keep.&quot;

&quot;We thank Thee for the day that’s done,&quot;

&quot;We trust Thee for the days to be.&quot;

&quot;Thy love we learn in Christ Thy Son,&quot;

&quot;O may we all His glory see.&quot;

&quot;Amen.&quot;

==History==

The Boys&#x27; Brigade was founded in Glasgow by Sir William Alexander Smith on 4 October 1883 to develop Christian manliness by the use of a semi-military discipline and order, gymnastics, summer camps and religious services and classes. 
By 1910, there were about 2200 companies connected with different churches throughout the British Empire and the United States, with 10,000 officers and 100,000 boys.

===Boys&#x27; Brigade Scouts, 1906–1927===
Companies of The Boys&#x27; Brigade used manuals on scout training in their programmes. In May 1903, Robert Baden-Powell became a vice-president. Baden-Powell promoted the idea of scouting and outdoor pursuits in the Boys&#x27; Brigade and other boys&#x27; organisations and schools. The Boys&#x27; Brigade formally began its boy scout scheme in 1906. Scout badges (Silver second class &amp; Gold first class) were awarded in The Boys&#x27; Brigade and there were specialised Boys&#x27; Brigade Scout sections, which operated as part of a BB Company, but met at different times to train in scouting, who wore khaki or blue uniforms, neck scarves and the distinctive four dented broad brimmed fur felt hats. Boys of the Bournemouth &amp; Poole Battalion of The Boys&#x27; Brigade participated in Baden-Powell&#x27;s experimental camp on Brownsea Island in 1907. Baden-Powell did not originally intend to start a separate organisation.

Many Boys&#x27; Brigade Scouts later made dual registration with The Boy Scouts Association. The 1st Bournemouth Scouts was run by the 1st Bournemouth Boys&#x27; Brigade as a &#x27;BP&#x27; Scout group and never a &#x27;BB Scout &#x27;Section&#x27;. The Boys&#x27; Life Brigade, which merged with The Boys&#x27; Brigade in 1926, also operated its own boy scouts and was a member organization of the National Peace Scouts with the British Boy Scouts. The Boys&#x27; Brigade Scouts continued until 1927. Some former Boys&#x27; Brigade Scout units continued independently after 1927 or affiliated with The Boy Scouts&#x27; Association or British Boy Scouts. Two of the original Boys&#x27; Brigade Scout units continue as 1st Parkstone Scout Group and 1st Hamworthy Scout Group, both formerly sub units of the 1st Poole Boys Brigade.

===Merger with Boys&#x27; Life Brigade, 1926===
In October 1926, The BB united with The Boys&#x27; Life Brigade. The Boys&#x27; Life Brigade had been formed in 1899, as a pacifist alternative to the BB, by the National Sunday School Union and was strongest amongst non-conformist churches. It substituted first aid drill for the military and weapons drill used in the BB. The merger prompted the abandonment of weapons and dummy drill rifles that had been used in the BB, due to the Life Brigade&#x27;s objections to use of weapons or their representations. The BB anchor badge was altered to include a red cross of the Boys&#x27; Life Brigade. Prior to the amalgamation in 1926, the junior organisation of the BB was called &#x27;The Boy Reserves&#x27; but after amalgamation the juniors were called &#x27;The Life Boys&#x27;. The name came from the fact that the junior reserve of The Boys&#x27; Life Brigade had been known as &#x27;Lifeboys&#x27; (all one word). The Life Boys remained as the &#x27;Junior Reserve of the BB until 1966 when the name was changed to &#x27;The Junior Section&#x27;.

==Establishment of recreational camping==
Drawing from his military experience, William Smith (Knighted in 1909) introduced the concept of camping into the Brigade to allow boys and officers to remain in contact when other activities ceased for the summer break.
The notion was initially ill-received due to concerns for the boys&#x27; safety. A mother has been quoted saying, &quot;Camp! My children have always had a roof over their heads, and as long as I live, always will!&quot;. They did have a roof over their heads because William Smith proceeded with the idea and 1st Glasgow Company held its inaugural one-week camp beginning on Friday, 16 July 1886, at Auchinlochan Hall, Tighnabruaich in a hall. In later years they took to canvas camping on a site at Portavadie in the Kyles of Bute. The First Glasgow continued to attend summer camp at the same location until the summer of 1974 when Portavadie was selected as the location of a proposed yard for the construction of oil production platforms. However the new camp is located only 100 yards away at Stilliag farm. This camp site is now used by many companies of the BB every summer for their camping trip.

The initial reservations towards camping did not last. A tradition developed, where the boys who were marching home on the last day of camp would be greeted by cheers from residents and were each presented with a bouquet of flowers. Camps soon became one of the most anticipated events in the year and early publications of the &quot;Boys&#x27; Brigade Gazette&quot; contained many accounts of camping experiences.

Sir William Smith&#x27;s plans and notes for his first camps have been preserved, and have been used by many other campers.

==Sections in the BB==
Age groups are typically based on school years, so boys in the same year group would be promoted to the next section together, regardless of the dates of individual boys&#x27; birthdays. In some companies, sections may merge or there may be minor variations to the normal age boundaries, to accommodate excessively large or small groups of boys or a lack of leaders. Boys might also move to their next section before the end of the year to allow a smoother transition.

*Australia has three different age groups, known as &quot;sections&quot;:
**Anchors – 5 to 7 years
**Juniors – 8 to 11 years
**Seniors – 12 to 18 years
*** &#x27;Alpha&#x27; – 12 to 14
*** &#x27;Omega&#x27; – 15 to 18
*Malaysia has four sections:
**Pre-Juniors – 6 to 8 years
**Juniors – 9 to 12 years
**Seniors– 12 to 18 years
**Primer– 18 to 21 years

:(All Malaysian Boys&#x27; Brigade companies may accept girls into membership with the approval of their respective sponsoring authorities.)

*United Kingdom has four sections:
** Anchor 5 to 8 years (companies need special permission to accept boys younger than 5 years old)
** Juniors – 8 to 11 years
** Company – 11 to 15 years
** Seniors – 15 to 18 years
Officers company and over

:(Companies may choose to run a Girls&#x27; Association alongside or in combination with these sections)

:In the United Kingdom and Ireland The BB is divided into four Regions, each region is then further divided. In Scotland and England &amp; Wales The BB is divided into Districts and then Battalions. In Northern Ireland the BB is divided into 13 Battalions. The Battalions provide a local grouping of companies. The Battalions are normally based on Cities or Counties. Each Battalion has its own local structure that organises events and training on behalf of the member companies.each with its own Battalion President and Executive Team who assist the President in running the Battalion.

==Amicus Groups==
*United Kingdom
:Amicus was launched in 1994, and is intended to either run as an alternative to the Seniors programme or even without any other Boys&#x27; or Girls&#x27; Brigade sections operating. Unlike other sections which may be for boys only in many companies, Amicus is always run as a mixed-gender group. The Amicus concept emphasises involvement of all its members in decision-making concerning the running of the section, such as the content and whether a uniform is to be worn. The section is overseen and supervised by leaders aged over 18, who have received training from the Boys&#x27; Brigade and may deliver parts of the programme.

==Leadership==
===Officers (adult leaders)===
Leaders in training are Warrant Officers, attaining the rank of Lieutenant only when having completed additional formal training in youth leadership. To avoid unnecessary leader hierarchy, all qualified officers are Lieutenants. The post of Captain of a company is a brevet rank with those in the position reverting to Lieutenant when they cease to be in the position; similarly, other positions such as the company Adjutant (second to the captain) are considered appointments rather than substantive ranks.

Boys bearing the rank of Staff-Sergeant are non-commissioned officers but act within the company as Officers.

===Boys as non-commissioned officers===

An older boy can gain promotion from Private to become a Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO). There are four NCO ranks available, each being awarded when a boy is of a certain minimum age and reaches a high enough standard of leadership:

* Lance Corporal – L/Cpl (minimum age 14)
* Corporal – Cpl (minimum age 15)
* Sergeant – Sgt (minimum age 16)
* Staff Sergeant – S/Sgt (minimum age 17)
* Warrant Officer – WO 

NCOs often play an important role in the Boys&#x27; Brigade, helping the officers and other adult helpers with organising activities and awards classes, particular in the Anchors and Juniors sections. NCOs wear chevrons on their upper right arm.

Staff Sergeants act within the company as officers and do not stand in the ranks; however as Staff Sergeants are boys of the Brigade, they can still partake in company activities and competitions, and still earn awards and badges. The uniform of Staff Sergeants is slightly different from that of the normal boy or NCO, they will still wear a blue shirt. If caps are worn, the BB Anchor is used with no coloured surround. Their rank is denoted with an armband on the right forearm with four inverted chevrons (similar to the rank badge historically worn by senior grades of sergeant in the British Army).

* United Kingdom
: In the United Kingdom, those aged 17 to 21 years old who are nominated by their company, may participate in The Boys&#x27; Brigade KGVI Youth Leadership Training; this consists of two one-week-long residential training experiences containing all the training needed to become an officer in The Boys&#x27; Brigade. KGVI is held at each of the Regional Headquarters (Felden Lodge in England/Wales, Carronvale House in Scotland and Newport Centre in Northern Ireland).

==Awards==
Each section within the Boys&#x27; Brigade has awards that can be gained by fulfilling achievements.

===Anchor Section===
The Anchors can gain three badges: Green, Red and Blue triangles by completing a variety of activities in the areas of Body, Mind, Spirit, Community, and Creativity.

The Anchors award structure was revamped in 2020 and now have the following badges available: Anchors Membership Award, Core Awards of Yellow Award, Green Award, Blue Award and the Red Award.

===Junior Section===
The Juniors award scheme was revised in 2004 and members of the section can now gain the Junior Target Award, followed by Bronze, Silver and Gold awards, by completing a variety of activities in the areas of Body, Mind, Spirit, Community, and Creativity.

The Juniors award structure was revamped again in 2020 and now have the following badges available, Juniors Membership Award, Core awards of Bronze, Silver and Gold, and Project Awards of Get Active, Get Adventurous, Get Creative, Get Into The Bible, Get Involved and Get Learning. The Leading Boy/Girl Badges have also been replaced by Team Leader. This structure also sees the introduction of a &quot;Nights Away&quot; badge and can be awarded at 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75 &amp; 100 nights. This continues from the Junior Section through to the Company and Senior Sections.

===Company Section===
====Get the Credit [Outdated]====
Under the old &#x27;Get the Credit&#x27; Scheme, Company Section members could gain one Target badge first (reduced from the required two in an award reorganisation a few years ago, though Target Two could still be completed as an optional extra), then five other badges (Interests, Adventure, Leadership, Physical and Community) with red and blue flashes around them. After about three years, the boys would have gained all five badges with both red and blue flashes. This enabled the boys to attend a Leadership Training Course and potentially attain the President&#x27;s Badge. This is a necessary prerequisite for the Brigade&#x27;s highest award – the King&#x27;s Badge.

====Discover====
The current award scheme for 11- to 15-year-olds, called Discover, was launched in August 2007. The award scheme is built around three &#x27;zones&#x27;: Community; Recreation; and Skills. Badges may be gained at four Levels in each zone, 1 through 4.

Having spent two hours working on topics relevant to each of the three zones (a total of six hours), the member is awarded the Compass Badge.

The badge for a zone is gained when the required number of hours have been spent working on topics relevant to that zone (Community – seven hours; Recreation – 10 hours; Skills – 7 hours). A maximum of one badge per zone can be gained in a 12-month period (min 24 hours work). Any additional hours may not be carried over into the next 12-month period. In subsequent 12-month periods, members will work to gain Levels 2, 3, and 4 of each badge.

During a member&#x27;s second year in Company Section they may gain the Discovery Badge, provided they have: gained a badge in all three zones within the last 12 months; completed an additional 6 hours work in any of the zones; taken part in a residential experience; played an active role in a Company, Battalion, or Church event; and had good attendance for the session.

The Discover programme includes the President&#x27;s Badge, the requirements for which remain similar to those laid out in the &#x27;Get the Credit&#x27; scheme. Including a &#x27;Building Your Skills&#x27; Course

See images and logos at boys-brigade.org.uk.

====Challenge Plus====
The award scheme for Seniors (16- to 18-year-olds), is called Challenge Plus, and was launched in time for the start for the 2008/09 Session, and includes the King&#x27;s Badge.

====King&#x27;s Badge====
King&#x27;s Badge is the highest award in the senior section in the UK and the Commonwealth; it is equivalent to a Founder&#x27;s Badge.

====Founder&#x27;s Badge====
In non-Commonwealth countries, the Founder&#x27;s Badge is used in place of the King&#x27;s Badge. However, the Boys&#x27; Brigade in Malaysia and the Boys&#x27; Brigade in Singapore have chosen to use the Founder&#x27;s Badge, although these countries are members of the Commonwealth.

====President&#x27;s Badge====
President&#x27;s badge is the second highest award in the senior section, it is also a requirement for members before undertaking the highest award which is Founder&#x27;s badge. The title of Founder&#x27;s Man and President&#x27;s Man are held for life, recognizing all rounds of excellence in their service. The Badge itself may be worn while serving as a Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO), a Staff-Sergeant, or a Primer.

==International==
===Sovereign countries===
Dates in parentheses indicate the year when the movement was revived after being dormant or defunct after the initial establishment.

<text>Berenguer Ramon II &quot;the Fratricide&quot; (1053/54 – 1097/99) was count of Barcelona from 1076 to 1097. He was the son of Ramon Berenguer I and Almodis of La Marche, and initially ruled jointly with his twin brother Ramon Berenguer II.

== Life ==
Born in 1053 or 1054, Berenguer Ramon succeeded his father Ramon Berenguer I &quot;the Old&quot; in 1076 to co-rule with his twin brother Ramon Berenguer II. The twins failed to cooperate, leading Pope Gregory VII to appeal for their reconciliation in 1079. The Catalonian possessions were divided between them, against the will of their late father, and it was agreed that the brothers would alternate their residence at the palace in Barcelona every six months. When the first agreement inevitably fell through, a second was reached in December of 1080.

Ramon Berenguer II was killed two years later while hunting in the woods on 5 December 1082. Berenguer Ramon II, who became the sole ruler of Catalonia for the next four years, was popularly suspected of orchestrating this murder, earning his nickname “the Fratricide.” This suspicion and other divisions of loyalty led to a civil war, weakening the authority of Barcelona over the counties of Carcassonne and Razès while various parties asserted ways to resolve this ‘unjust and iniquitous murder.’ In 1085, the count of Cerdanya was chosen by the bishop of Vic and an assembly of Catalonian magnates to avenge Ramon Berenguer II, but in June 1086, a compromise was reached, allowing Berenguer Ramon to continue his rule of Barcelona as regent for his brother&#x27;s four-year-old son Ramon Berenguer III until he came of age. Ramon Berenguer III began to appear in documents as “count” as soon as 1089.

== Conflict with El Cid ==
In the 1080s, Berenguer Ramon&#x27;s involvement in the internal strife in the Moorish taifa kingdoms brought him in conflict with El Cid, whose service had been refused by the count of Barcelona in 1081. In the ensuing war Berenguer Ramon was twice taken prisoner. Upon the death of Ahmad al-Muqtadir in 1081/1082, the count allied with al-Muqtadir’s younger son Mundhir al-Hajib to seize Zaragoza from his older brother Yusuf al-Mu’taman. Berenguer Ramon and al-Hajib laid siege to Almenar, near Lleida, where they were attacked and defeated by El Cid. Berenguer and his knights were captured, taken to al-Mu’taman, and released for a ransom shortly after.

By 1090, al-Hajib and Berenguer had made several attempts to conquer Valencia which was ruled by Yahya al-Qadir as a vassalage of Alfonso VI of León and Castile. After the compromise in 1086, Berenguer Ramon and al-Hajib had ravaged the surrounding countryside and unsuccessfully besieged the city in 1088 and 1089, but the freshly outlawed El Cid again stood in their way the following year. El Cid collected the tributes from al-Qadir and al-Hajib owed to Alfonso and Berenguer, respectively, leading to the formation of a coalition between Alfonso, Berenguer, Sancho Ramírez of Navarre, and al-Musta’in II of Zaragoza to oppose El Cid. The coalition quickly fell apart, and Berenguer was left to challenge El Cid alone.

Berenguer marched out with his army and made camp near the mountainside pinewood of Tévar where El Cid had encamped. Both men attempted to provoke the other through an exchange of letters in which Berenguer accused El Cid of violating churches and trusting in ornithomancy while El Cid reminded the count of his defeat in 1082 and alluded to his alleged fratricide. In the subsequent battle, El Cid’s forces broke through the Catalan formation, defeating and capturing the count a second time. After his release, Berenguer went to Zaragoza where al-Musta’in mediated a peace conducted by letter between him and El Cid who had withdrawn to Daroca to recover from his wounds.

== Attacks on Tortosa ==
In 1089, Pope Urban II sought to recover the archbishopric of Tarragona from the Muslims, promising the remission of sins to anyone who participated in the restoration effort. Berenguer Ramon undertook this endeavor in 1090 and agreed to pay a tribute to the papacy and allow its suzerainty over Barcelona’s territories. This was possibly done under pressure from Bishop Berenguer of Vic, later archbishop of Tarragona. Three years later, Berenguer Ramon launched an unsuccessful campaign against Tortosa to secure the territories surrounding the newly settled Tarragona and expand the county of Barcelona. 400 ships employed from Genoa and Pisa contributed to the siege.

== Death and succession ==
Berenguer Ramon resigned the countship in 1097. After that his life became more obscure. Still living under the accusations of his brother&#x27;s assassination, the guilt of which may have been determined by trial by combat at the court of Alfonso VI, which he lost, he joined his half-brother Raymond of Saint-Gilles in the First Crusade as a penance. It is possible that he perished on the walls of Jerusalem in 1099.

<text>Ramon Berenguer II &quot;the Towhead&quot; or &quot;Cap de estopes&quot; (1053 or 1054 – December 5, 1082) was Count of Barcelona from 1076 until his death. He was the son of Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona, and Almodis de La Marche. The &quot;Chronicle of San Juan de la Pena&quot; called him, &quot;… exceeding brave and bold, kind, pleasant, pious, joyful, generous, and of an attractive appearance&quot;. Because of the extremely thick hair he had on top of his head, he was known as Cap d&#x27;Estop.&quot;

He succeeded his father as co-ruler with his twin brother, Berenguer Ramon II in 1075. The twins failed to agree and divided their possessions between them, against the will of their late father. Ramon Berenguer the Towhead, so called because of the thickness and colour of his hair, was killed while hunting in the woods in 1082. His brother, who went on to become the sole ruler of Catalonia, was credited by popular opinion of having orchestrated this murder. Berenguer Ramon II &quot;the Fratricide&quot; was later succeeded by Ramon Berenguer&#x27;s son, Ramon Berenguer III.

== Family and issue ==

Ramon Berenguer married Mahalta (or Maud) of Apulia, born ca. 1059, died 1111/1112, daughter of Duke Robert Guiscard and of Sikelgaita de Salerno. Following his murder, she remarried to Aimery I of Narbonne, and was the mother of his son Aimery II.

Ramon Berenguer and Mahalta&#x27;s son, Ramon Berenguer III (before 1082–1131), was count of Barcelona and Provence.

<text>Ramon Berenguer I ( 1023 – 26 May 1076), called the Old (, ), was Count of Barcelona in 1035–1076. He promulgated the earliest versions of a written code of Catalan law, the Usages of Barcelona.

Born in about 1023, he succeeded his father, Berenguer Ramon I the Crooked in 1035. It was during his reign that the dominant position of Barcelona among the other Catalan counties became evident.

Ramon Berenguer campaigned against the Moors, extending his dominions as far west as Barbastro and imposing heavy tributes (&quot;parias&quot;) on other Moorish cities. Historians claim that those tributes helped create the first wave of prosperity in Catalan history. During his reign Catalan maritime power started to be felt in the western Mediterranean. Ramon Berenguer the Old was also the first count of Catalonia to acquire lands (the counties of Carcassonne and Razés) and influence north of the Pyrenees. 

Another major achievement of his was beginning the codification of Catalan law in the written &quot;Usatges&quot; of Barcelona which was to become the first full compilation of feudal law in Western Europe. Legal codification was part of the count&#x27;s efforts to forward and somehow control the process of feudalization which started during the reign of his weak father, Berenguer Ramon. Another major contributor was the Church acting through the institution of the Peace and Truce of God. This established a general truce among warring factions and lords in a given region for a given time. The earliest extant date for introducing the Truce of God in Western Europe is 1027 in Catalonia, during the reign of his father, Berenguer Ramon.

While still married to his second wife Blanca, he became involved with the wife of the Count of Toulouse, Almodis de La Marche, countess of Limoges. Both quickly married and were consequently excommunicated by Pope Victor II.

Ramon Berenguer I, together with his third wife Almodis, also founded the Romanesque cathedral of Barcelona, to replace the older basilica presumably destroyed by Almanzor. Their velvet and brass bound wooden coffins are still displayed in the Gothic cathedral which eventually replaced the cathedral that they founded.

He was succeeded by his twin sons Ramon Berenguer II and Berenguer Ramon II.

==Family and issue==
* First wife, possibly Isabel, daughter of Count Sancho of Gascony
** Berenguer (died young)
** Arnau (died young)
** Peter Raymundi (1050–1073?), murdered his father&#x27;s third wife, Almodis, and was exiled
* Second wife, Blanca of Narbonne, daughter of Llop Ato Zuberoa and Ermengarda of Narbonne
* Third wife, Almodis de La Marche, countess of Limoges
** Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona &quot;the Towhead&quot; (1053/54–1082)
** Berenguer Ramon II, Count of Barcelona &quot;the Fratricide&quot; (1053/54–1097)
** Agnes, married Guigues II of Albon
** Sancha, married William Raymond, count of Cerdanya

<text>The Cronquist system is a taxonomic classification system of flowering plants. It was developed by Arthur Cronquist in a series of monographs and texts, including &quot;The Evolution and Classification of Flowering Plants&quot; (1968; 2nd edition, 1988) and &quot;An Integrated System of Classification of Flowering Plants&quot; (1981) (&quot;see&quot; Bibliography).

Cronquist&#x27;s system places flowering plants into two broad classes, [[Magnoliopsida]] (dicotyledons) and [[Liliopsida]] (monocotyledons). Within these classes, related orders are grouped into subclasses. While the scheme was widely used, in either the original form or in adapted versions, many botanists now use the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants, first developed in 1998. The system as laid out in Cronquist&#x27;s &quot;An Integrated System of Classification of Flowering Plants&quot; (1981) counts 64 orders and 321 families in class Magnoliopsida and 19 orders and 65 families in class Liliopsida.

<text>Victor/Victoria is a 1982 musical comedy film written and directed by Blake Edwards and starring Julie Andrews, James Garner, Robert Preston, Lesley Ann Warren, Alex Karras, and John Rhys-Davies. The film was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, produced by Tony Adams and scored by Henry Mancini, with lyrics by Leslie Bricusse. &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; was adapted as a Broadway musical in 1995. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score or Adaptation Score. It is based on the 1933 German film &quot;Victor and Victoria&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1934 Paris, Carroll &quot;Toddy&quot; Todd, an aging gay performer at Club Chez Lui, sees Labisse, the owner, auditioning frail and impoverished soprano Victoria Grant. After her failed audition, Victoria returns to her hotel room to find herself about to be evicted, as she cannot pay her rent. That night, when hustler Richard, with whom Toddy is romantically involved, comes to Chez Lui as part of a straight foursome, Toddy incites a brawl resulting in damage and the police locking up whomever they can get their hands on. Labisse fires Toddy and bans him from the club. Walking home, Toddy spots Victoria in a restaurant. She invites him to join her. As both of them are poor, she plans to dump a cockroach in her salad to avoid paying, but it escapes and mayhem ensues.

The duo run through the rain to Toddy&#x27;s, and he invites her to stay when she discovers the rain has shrunk and damaged her decrepit clothing. The next morning Richard shows up to collect his things. Victoria, who is wearing his suit and hat, hides in Toddy&#x27;s closet. When Richard opens the closet, she punches him, breaking his nose before kicking him out. Seeing this, Toddy is struck with the inspiration of passing Victoria off as a man and presenting her to successful talent agent Andre Cassell as a female impersonator.

Cassell accepts her as Count Victor Grazinski, a gay Polish impersonator and Toddy&#x27;s new boyfriend. Cassell gets her a booking in a nightclub show and invites club owners to the opening. Among the guests are Chicago gangster King Marchand, his moll Norma Cassidy and bodyguard Mr. Bernstein, also known as Squash. Victoria becomes a hit. King is smitten, but is shocked when she &quot;reveals&quot; herself to be a man at the end of the act. King, however, is convinced that &quot;Victor&quot; is not a man.

After Norma attacks King during a quarrel, he sends her back to the United States. Determined to uncover the truth, King sneaks into Victoria and Toddy&#x27;s suite and confirms his suspicion when he spies her getting into the bath. In Chicago, Norma, angry over being dumped, tells King&#x27;s business partner Sal Andretti that King is having an affair with a man. King invites Victoria, Toddy and Cassell to Chez Lui. Another fight breaks out. Squash and Toddy are arrested, along with many of the club clientele, but King and Victoria escape. King kisses Victoria, pretending that he does not care about her assumed gender.

Squash returns to the suite and catches him in bed with Victoria. King tries to explain, but then Squash reveals that he himself is gay. Victoria and King argue over whether or not the relationship could work and Victoria discovers that King is not really a gangster but someone who pretends to be to stay in the nightclub business. Both he and Victoria are pretending to be something they are not. Victoria returns to her room and finds Squash in bed with Toddy.

Meanwhile, Labisse hires private investigator Charles Bovin to tail Victor. Victoria and King attempt to live together, but keeping up her deception strains the relationship, and King eventually ends it.

At the same time that Victoria decides to give up the Victor persona to be with King, Sal arrives and demands that King transfer his share of the business to Sal for a fraction of what it is actually worth. Squash tells Victoria what is happening, and she shows Norma that she is really a woman, saving King&#x27;s stake. That night at the club, Cassell tells Toddy and Victoria that Labisse lodged a police complaint against him and &quot;Victor&quot; for perpetrating a public fraud. After checking for himself, the inspector tells Labisse that the performer he saw in the room, after opening the door, is a man and that Labisse is an idiot.

Victoria joins King in the club as her real self. The announcer says that Victor will perform, but instead of Victoria, Toddy masquerades as &quot;Victor&quot;. After an intentionally disastrous performance, Toddy claims that this is his last performance.

==Cast==
==Musical numbers==
The vocal numbers in the film are presented as nightclub acts, with choreography by Paddy Stone. However, the lyrics or situations of some of the songs are calculated to relate to the unfolding drama. Thus, the two staged numbers &quot;Le Jazz Hot&quot; and &quot;The Shady Dame from Seville&quot; help to present Victoria as a female impersonator. The latter number is later reinterpreted by Toddy for diversionary purposes in the plot, and the cozy relationship of Toddy and Victoria is promoted by the song &quot;You and Me&quot;, which is sung before the audience at the nightclub.

# &quot;Gay Paree&quot; – Toddy
# &quot;Le Jazz Hot!&quot; – Victoria
# &quot;The Shady Dame from Seville&quot; – Victoria
# &quot;You and Me&quot; – Toddy, Victoria
# &quot;Chicago, Illinois&quot; – Norma
# &quot;Crazy World&quot; – Victoria
# &quot;Finale/Shady Dame from Seville (Reprise)&quot; – Toddy

Occasionally, Victoria and Toddy sing &quot;Home on the Range&quot; when they are in the hotel.

==Production==
The film&#x27;s screenplay was adapted by Blake Edwards (Andrews&#x27;s husband) from the 1933 German film &quot;Victor and Victoria&quot; written and directed by Reinhold Schünzel from an original story treatment by Hans Hoemburg. According to Edwards, the screenplay took only one month to write. Andrews watched the 1933 version to prepare for her role. The film had been planned as early as 1978 with Andrews to star alongside Peter Sellers, but Sellers died in 1980 while Andrews and Edwards were filming &quot;S.O.B.&quot; (1981), so Robert Preston was cast in the role of Toddy.

The costume worn by Andrews in the number &quot;The Shady Dame from Seville&quot; is in fact the same costume worn by Preston at the end of the film. It was made to fit Preston, and then, using a series of hooks and eyes at the back, it was drawn in tight to fit Andrews&#x27; shapely figure. Black silk ruffles were added to the bottom of the garment to hide the differences in height. The fabric is a black and brown crepe, with fine gold threads woven into it, that when lit appears to have an almost wet look about it.

==Release==
&quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; was the opening night film at Filmex on March 16, 1982. It opened in New York, Los Angeles, and Toronto on March 19, 1982.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it 3 out of 4 stars and wrote: &quot;Not only a funny movie, but, unexpectedly, a warm and friendly one.&quot;
Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;sparkling, ultra-sophisticated entertainment from Blake Edwards.&quot;

Vincent Canby in &quot;The New York Times&quot; was enthusiastic, calling the film &quot;so good, so exhilarating, that the only depressing thing about it is the suspicion that Mr. Edwards is going to have a terrible time trying to top it.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Driven by a fantastic lead turn from Julie Andrews, Blake Edwards&#x27; musical gender-bender is sharp, funny and all-round entertaining.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 84 out of 100 based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Accolades===
In 2000, American Film Institute included the film in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs (#76).

<text>A robe is a loose-fitting outer garment. Unlike garments described as capes or cloaks, robes usually have sleeves. The English word &quot;robe&quot; derives from Middle English &quot;robe&quot; (&quot;garment&quot;), borrowed from Old French &quot;robe&quot; (&quot;booty, spoils&quot;), itself taken from the Frankish word *&quot;rouba&quot; (&quot;spoils, things stolen, clothes&quot;), and is related to the word &quot;rob&quot;.

==Types==
There are various types of robes, including:

* A gown worn as part of the academic regalia of faculty or students, especially for ceremonial occasions, such as a convocations, or graduations. 
* A gown worn as part of the attire of a judge or barrister.
* A wide variety of long, flowing religious dress including pulpit robes and the robes worn by various types of monks.
* A gown worn as part of the official dress of a peer or royalty. 
* Any of several women&#x27;s fashions of French origin, as &quot;robe à l&#x27;anglaise&quot; (18th century), &quot;robe de style&quot; (1920s).
* A gown worn in fantasy literature and role-playing games by wizards and other magical characters.
* A bathrobe worn mostly after bathing or swimming.
* A gown used to cover a state of underdress, often after rising in the morning, is called a dressing gown. They are similar to a bathrobe but without the absorbent material.
* (Informal usage) Any long flowing garment; for example, a cassock is sometimes called a &quot;robe&quot;, although a cassock is close-fitting.
* A cured animal hide with fur or hair still attached, often from a buffalo, either worn or used in the home for warmth.

The script was based upon William Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Shadowland&quot;, a fictional biography of Farmer, and many of his fictional elements were incorporated into the final film. The biography has since been allegedly discredited, with Arnold having stated in court that he fabricated the story of Farmer&#x27;s transorbital lobotomy and other aspects of the book. Writer Jeffrey Kauffmann published an extensive online essay, &quot;Shedding Light on &quot;Shadowland&quot;&quot;, that debunks much of Arnold&#x27;s book, including the account of the lobotomy.

Shadowland Revisited: The Story of a Book and Its Aftermath, provides an extensive interview with Arnold who goes over most of his allegations in the book and he stands by his theory that Farmer was lobotomized, among other aspects of Farmer&#x27;s life that Kauffmann attempts to dispel.

==Plot==
Born in Seattle, Washington, Frances Elena Farmer is a rebel from a young age, winning $100 in 1931 from the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards for a high school essay called &quot;God Dies&quot;. In 1935, she becomes controversial again when she wins (and accepts) an all-expenses-paid trip to the USSR to visit its Moscow Art Theatre. Determined to become an actress, Frances is equally determined not to play the Hollywood game: she refuses to acquiesce to publicity stunts, and insists upon appearing on screen without makeup. She marries her first husband, Dwayne Steele, despite being advised not to, but cheats on him with alleged Communist Harry York on the night of her hometown&#x27;s premiere of &quot;Come and Get It&quot;. Her defiance attracts the attention of Broadway playwright Clifford Odets, who convinces Frances that her future rests with the Group Theatre.

After leaving Hollywood for New York City and appearing in the Group Theatre play &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, Frances learns, much to her chagrin, that the Group Theatre exploited her fame only to draw in more customers, replacing her with a wealthy actress for her family&#x27;s needed financial backing for the play&#x27;s London tour, and Odets ends their affair upon his wife&#x27;s upcoming return from Europe. Her desperate attempts to restart her film career upon returning to Hollywood results in being cast in unchallenging roles in forgettable B-films. Her increased dependence on alcohol and amphetamines in the 1940s and the pressures brought on her by her wannabe mother, who becomes her legal guardian after her multiple legal problems, result in a complete nervous breakdown. After her first hospitalization at Kimball Sanitarium in La Crescenta where she was forced to undergo insulin shock therapy and hydrotherapy, she tells her mother that she doesn&#x27;t want to return to Hollywood but instead wants to live alone in the countryside, assaulting and threatening Lillian in the resulting argument. While institutionalized at Western State Hospital, Frances is abused by the powers that be: she is subjected to electroconvulsive shock therapy, is cruelly beaten, periodically raped by the male orderlies and visiting soldiers from a nearby military base and involuntarily lobotomized before her release in 1950.

In 1958, Frances is paid honor on Ralph Edwards&#x27; &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; television program, which Harry York watches from his home. When asked about alcoholism, illegal drugs and mental illness, Farmer denies them all and says, &quot;If you&#x27;re treated like a patient, you&#x27;re apt to act like one&quot;. The film ends just after a party honoring her at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with Farmer walking down a street with Harry York, talking about her parents&#x27; deaths, how she sold their house and that she&#x27;s a &quot;faceless sinner&quot; with a slower paced lifestyle ahead of her in the future. The end credits state that she moved to Indianapolis shortly afterwards, hosting a local daytime TV program (&quot;Frances Farmer Presents&quot;) from 1958 to 1964 before dying alone, just as she had lived, on August 1, 1970, at age 56.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was developed by the team who had made &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, writers Eric Bergren and Christopher De Vore, and producer Jonathan Sanger and Mel Brooks. Brooks was keen for David Lynch, who had directed &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, to direct. However, Lynch had signed an agreement with Universal. Sanger then suggested Graeme Clifford, who was well established as an editor, notably having made several films with Robert Altman. &quot;He&#x27;s very bright and completely in love with the story&quot;, said Brooks.

The script was based upon William Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Shadowland&quot;, a fictional biography of Farmer. In pre-production, the producers reneged on their option to use the book as source material. Arnold filed an unsuccessful copyright infringement lawsuit but many of his fictional elements were incorporated into the final film.

On the commentary of the DVD release, director Clifford stated, &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to nickel and dime people to death with facts.&quot; Mel Brooks was executive producer of the film, but as with &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, Brooks intentionally received no credit for his participation as his name had been attributed to parodies or crude comedies.

The filmmakers struggled to gain finance until EMI Films stepped in.

Lange found the nude scene of Farmer&#x27;s arrest with policemen breaking into the Knickerbocker Hotel frustrating and demanding; there was a problem with the bathroom door which stuck each time the actors playing cops on the other side tried to get it open. The entire scene, lasting no more than three minutes of film time, took four days to shoot. Lange was &quot;disgusted&quot; and felt &quot;used, abused, and manipulated&quot;, as was Frances herself.

===Casting===
Many actresses were considered candidates for the role of Frances Farmer including Anne Archer, Susan Blakely, Blythe Danner, Susan Dey, Patty Duke, Mia Farrow, Sally Field, Jane Fonda, Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton, Liza Minnelli, Susan Sarandon, Cybill Shepherd, Sissy Spacek, Meryl Streep, Natalie Wood and Tuesday Weld. Faye Dunaway turned it down.

&quot;This is a role every actress waits all her life for&quot;, said Hawn.

Jessica Lange had wanted to play the role since reading Farmer&#x27;s memoirs in the late 1970s. She tried to interest Bob Rafelson and Bob Fosse to make the film but neither was interested. Then she says Clifford called her directly offering the role. (Clifford had edited Lange in &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;.)

&quot;She was very high-strung and had overpowering elements in her personality of self-destruction, but she was a real warrior&quot;, said Lange. &quot;It was misguided heroics.&quot;

&quot;I began to identify with Frances Farmer&#x27;s anger&quot;, said Lange. &quot;She would release it no matter what the consequences were.&quot;

Susan Blakely went on to portray Farmer in the 1983 CBS television film &quot;Will There Really Be a Morning?&quot;

===Music===
The original music score was composed by John Barry. According to Barry, his idea of carrying the main theme using a harmonica was initially disliked by producers until they heard it fully orchestrated. Along with some popular songs from the period, a notable piece of music was from Mozart&#x27;s Piano Sonata No.11, K331, and the second movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Seventh Symphony also featured.

===Editing===
The film originally ran for three hours and was cut down. This meant reduction of the amount of screen time dedicated to Frances and her parents, and Frances and her love interest. Clifford would subsequently claim he felt the film was too short.

==Reception==
&quot;Frances&quot; holds a 68% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 31 reviews with the consensus: &quot;This sordid biopic emphasizes the indignities visited upon Frances Farmer to the detriment of fleshing her out as a person, but Jessica Lange&#x27;s towering performance invests the tragic figure with a humanity that the script lacks.&quot;

<doc id="242529" wikidata="Q998324" url="?curid=242529" title="Pantherophis obsoletus">
<text>Pantherophis obsoletus, also known commonly as the western rat snake, black rat snake, pilot black snake, or simply black snake, is a nonvenomous species of snake in the family Colubridae. The species is native to central North America. There are no subspecies that are recognized as being valid. Its color variations include the Texas rat snake. Along with other snakes of the eastern United States, like the eastern indigo snake (&quot;Drymarchon couperi)&quot; and the eastern racer (&quot;Coluber constrictor&quot;), it is called “black snake”.

==Geographic range==
&quot;P. obsoletus&quot; is found west of the Mississippi River, from eastern and southern Iowa southward through Missouri and Arkansas to western Louisiana, westward to eastern Texas, northward through Oklahoma and eastern Kansas to southeastern Nebraska.

Aside from the usual variety that is black or has patches of black on a lighter background, color variations include

the Texas rat snake, which is a brown-to-black variant, often with tinges of orange or red, that can be found in southern Oklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana.
==Habitat==
Rat snakes of the genus &quot;Pantherophis&quot; are diurnally-active and live in a variety of habitats; some overlap each other. They have adapted to a variety of habitats, including bayou, prairie, and rock outcrops, but they seem to have a particular preference for wooded areas, especially oak trees. Rat snakes are excellent climbers and spend a significant amount of their time in trees. The black rat snake is also a competent swimmer.

During winter it hibernates in shared dens, often with copperheads and timber rattlesnakes. When found in homes, often in groups. This association gave rise to one of its common names, pilot black snake, and the superstition that this nonvenomous species led the venomous ones to the den.

==Description==

Adults of &quot;P. obsoletus&quot; can become quite large, with a reported typical total length (including tail) of . It is the largest snake found in Canada. The record total length is , making it (officially) the longest snake in North America. Unofficially, indigo snakes (genus &quot;Drymarchon&quot;) are known to exceed it, and one wild-caught pine snake (&quot;Pituophis melanoleucus&quot;), with a portion of its tail missing, measured . The body mass of &quot;P. obsoletus&quot; can range up to in adults, although most adults are on the smaller end of this scale, per herpetology research sites, with weights most commonly between .

Juveniles are strongly patterned with brown blotches on a gray background (like miniature fox snakes: &quot;P. gloydi&quot;, &quot;P. ramspotti&quot;, and &quot;P. vulpinus&quot;). Darkening occurs rapidly as they grow. Adults are glossy black above with white lips, chin, and throat. Sometimes traces of the &quot;obsolete&quot; juvenile pattern are still discernible in the skin between the scales, especially when stretched after a heavy meal.

==Common names==
Other common names for &quot;P. obsoletus&quot; include: gray rat snake, black chicken snake, black coluber, chicken snake, mountain black snake, mountain pilot snake, pilot, rat snake, rusty black snake, scaly black snake, cow snake, &quot;schwartze Schlange&quot;, sleepy John, and white-throated racer.
==Behavior==
When not fully grown, rat snakes are subject to predation by many animals, including other snakes. Once they attain maturity, they are readily preyed on by mammalian carnivores (including the American mink, which weighs no more than an adult rat snake) and large birds of prey (especially red-tailed hawks). When startled, they may freeze and wrinkle themselves into a series of kinks. If they feel further threatened, they may flee quickly or tail vibrate; although this act of tail vibration is indeed a behavior that rat snakes share with rattlesnakes, it is not a form of mimicry, as researchers have observed that snakes have used this method of tail vibration as a defense mechanism against predation long before the emergence of rattlesnakes. They are also capable of producing a foul-smelling musk, which they will release onto predators if picked up. They spread the musk with their tails in hopes of deterring the threat. When cornered or provoked, black snakes are known to stand their ground and can become aggressive. Counterattacks on large birds of prey, often committed by large snakes in excess of in length, have resulted in violent prolonged struggles. Utilizing its infamous agility and the great strength of its muscular coils, the black rat snake is sometimes able to overwhelm and kill formidable avian predators such as red-tailed hawks, great horned owls and red-shouldered hawks, though in many cases the bird is able to kill the snake and both combatants may even die.

==Feeding==

&quot;P. obsoletus&quot; is a constrictor, meaning it squeezes its prey to the point of cardiovascular collapse due to obstructive shock, coiling around small animals and tightening its grip until the prey can no longer circulate blood and dies of profound hypotension, before being eaten. Though it will often consume mice, voles, and rats, the western rat snake is far from a specialist at this kind of prey and will readily consume any small vertebrate it can catch. Other prey opportunistically eaten by this species can include other snakes (including both those of its own and other species), frogs, lizards, moles, chipmunks, squirrels, juvenile rabbits, juvenile opossums, songbirds, and bird eggs. One snake was observed to consume an entire clutch of mallard eggs. Cavity-nesting bird species are seemingly especially prevalent in this snake&#x27;s diet. The western rat snake has been noted as perhaps the top predator at purple martin colonies as a single large snake will readily consume a number of eggs, hatchlings, and adults each summer. Several rat snake repelling methods have been offered to those putting up martin houses, but most are mixed in success.

==Reproduction==

In &quot;P. obsoletus&quot; mating takes place in late May and early June. The male snake wraps its tail around the female with their vents nearly touching. The male then everts one of its sex organs, a hemipenis, into the female sex organ, the cloaca. The mating lasts a few minutes to a few hours. After five weeks, the female lays about 12 to 20 eggs, which are long by wide. The eggs hatch about 65 to 70 days later in late August to early October. The hatchlings are in total length, and they look like miniature fox snakes.

==Taxonomy==
This species has previously been placed (and is still placed by many) in the genus &quot;Elaphe&quot;, as &quot;Elaphe obsoleta&quot;. However, Utiger et al. found that &quot;Elaphe&quot; is broadly construed as paraphyletic, and placed this species in the genus &quot;Pantherophis&quot;. In addition, because &quot;Pantherophis&quot; is masculine, the specific epithet becomes the masculine &quot;obsoletus&quot;. The split of &quot;Pantherophis&quot; from &quot;Elaphe&quot; has been further confirmed by additional phylogenetic studies.

In 2001, suggested this species be divided into three species based on geographic patterns of mitochondrial DNA diversity. He assigned new common names and resurrected old scientific names, resulting in the following combinations: eastern ratsnake (&quot;Elaphe alleghaniensis&quot;, now &quot;Pantherophis alleghaniensis&quot;), central ratsnake (&quot;Elaphe spiloides&quot;, now &quot;Pantherophis spiloides&quot;), and western rat snake (&quot;Elaphe obsoleta&quot;, now &quot;Pantherophis obsoletus&quot;). However, these three species are not morphologically distinct and overlap in all examined morphological characters. More recent investigations have indicated &quot;P. alleghaniensis&quot; and &quot;P. spiloides&quot; interbreed freely in Ontario.

In 2008, Collins and resurrected the genus &quot;Scotophis&quot; for Burbrink&#x27;s three taxa (&quot;i.e.&quot;, &quot;Scotophis alleghaniensis&quot;, &quot;Scotophis spiloides&quot;, and &quot;Scotophis obsoletus&quot;) in response to the findings of Burbrink and , 2007. The justification for this nomenclatural change has been removed by more recent research.

==In captivity==
The western rat snake is available captive-bred in the United States pet trade, and it has been bred for mutations such as leucistic, albino, and scaleless. However, it is not as popular as other colubrids such as corn snakes, kingsnakes, milksnakes, and hognose snakes. Opinions vary on the western rat snake&#x27;s disposition, but captive-bred individuals are reported to be more docile than their wild counterparts. With appropriate care, this species may be expected to live 15 years in captivity, and possibly more.

<text>Debra Lynn Winger (born May 16, 1955) is an American actress. She starred in the films &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; (1982), &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; (1983), and &quot;Shadowlands&quot; (1993), each of which earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Winger won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress for &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;, and the Tokyo International Film Festival Award for Best Actress for &quot;A Dangerous Woman&quot; (1993).

Winger&#x27;s other films include &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; (1980), &quot;Legal Eagles&quot; (1986), &quot;Black Widow&quot; (1987), &quot;Betrayed&quot; (1988), &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; (1990), &quot;Forget Paris&quot; (1995), and &quot;Rachel Getting Married&quot; (2008). In 2012, she made her Broadway debut in the original production of David Mamet&#x27;s play &quot;The Anarchist&quot;. She received a lifetime achievement award at the Transilvania International Film Festival in 2014, and starred in the Netflix original television series &quot;The Ranch&quot; (2016–2020).

==Early years==
Winger was born in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, into a Jewish family, to Robert Winger, a meat packer, and Ruth (née Felder), an office manager. Over the years, she told many interviewers that she volunteered on an Israeli kibbutz, sometimes even saying she had trained with the Israel Defense Forces, but in a 2008 interview she said she was merely on a typical youth tour that visited the kibbutz. At age 18, after returning to the U.S., she was involved in a car crash and suffered a cerebral hemorrhage; as a result, she was left partially paralyzed and blind for 10 months, initially being told that she would never see again. With time on her hands to think about her life, she decided that, if she recovered, she would move to California and become an actress.

== Career ==

=== Acting ===

Winger&#x27;s first acting role was as &quot;Debbie&quot; in the 1976 sexploitation film &quot;Slumber Party &#x27;57&quot;. Her next role was as Diana Prince&#x27;s younger sister Drusilla (Wonder Girl) in three episodes of ABC&#x27;s TV series &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;. The producers wanted her to appear more often, but she refused, fearing that the role would hurt her fledgling career. This was followed by a guest role in season 4 of the TV drama &quot;Police Woman&quot; in 1978. Winger played a supporting role in Willard Huyck&#x27;s 1979 comic coming-of-age film &quot;French Postcards&quot;.

Winger&#x27;s first major role was in &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Friday,&quot; followed by &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; in 1980, for which she received a BAFTA nomination and a pair of Golden Globe nominations (for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role, and Best New Star). In 1982 she co-starred with Nick Nolte in &quot;Cannery Row&quot; and with Richard Gere in &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress twice more: for &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; in 1983 (which was awarded to her co-star, Shirley MacLaine, who played her mother in the film) and for &quot;Shadowlands&quot; in 1993, for which she also received her second BAFTA nomination. Her performance in &quot;A Dangerous Woman&quot; earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.

Over the years Winger acquired a reputation for being outspoken and difficult to work with. She has expressed her dislike of &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;, for which she refused to do any publicity, and several of her other films, and has been dismissive of some of her co-stars and directors. When Barbara Walters interviewed Bette Davis in 1986, Davis said, &quot;I see a great deal of myself in Debra Winger, who has already acquired a reputation for being difficult, because she cares about the project.&quot;

Winger was to play Peggy Sue in the film &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; but was forced to back out just before production began after injuring her back in a bicycle accident. The role went to Kathleen Turner. The injury affected Winger&#x27;s ability to work for several months. She was cast in &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; but dropped out and was replaced by Geena Davis. It was later reported that Winger dropped out of the film because she refused to work with Madonna, whom Winger did not consider a serious actress. Other starring roles during this period included &quot;Legal Eagles&quot;, &quot;Made in Heaven&quot;, &quot;Everybody Wins&quot;, &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;, &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;, &quot;Black Widow&quot;, &quot;Betrayed&quot;, &quot;Wilder Napalm&quot;, and &quot;A Dangerous Woman&quot;.

In 1995, Winger decided to take a hiatus from acting. In 2002, she said, &quot;I wanted out for years. I got sick of hearing myself say I wanted to quit. It&#x27;s like opening an interview with &#x27;I hate interviews!&#x27; Well, get out! I stopped reading scripts and stopped caring. People said, &#x27;We miss you so much.&#x27; But in the last six years, tell me a film that I should have been in. The few I can think of the actress was so perfect&quot;. After making &quot;Forget Paris&quot; in 1995, she was absent from the screen for six years before returning in 2001 with &quot;Big Bad Love&quot;, written and directed by her husband, Arliss Howard. The film was also Winger&#x27;s debut as a producer.

During her film hiatus, Winger had the female lead in the American Repertory Theater&#x27;s stage production of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s play &quot;Ivanov&quot; from November 1999 to January 2000.

Rosanna Arquette made a critically acclaimed documentary film, &quot;Searching for Debra Winger&quot;, that was released in 2002 after Winger returned to film acting. Winger subsequently starred in the films &quot;Radio&quot;, &quot;Eulogy&quot;, and &quot;Sometimes in April&quot;, and received positive reviews for portraying Anne Hathaway&#x27;s estranged mother in &quot;Rachel Getting Married&quot;.

Winger earned an Emmy Award nomination for her title role as the mother of a Columbine shooting victim in the 2005 television film &quot;Dawn Anna&quot;, directed by Arliss Howard. In 2010 she returned to television, making a guest appearance as a high school principal in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. She also joined the cast of HBO&#x27;s &quot;In Treatment&quot; as one of the three patients featured in the third season.

In 2013, Winger starred in three episodes of &quot;In the Woods&quot;, the first installment of Jennifer Elster&#x27;s multimedia, experimental film series &quot;The Being Experience&quot;, also including Terrence Howard, Dave Matthews, Rufus Wainwright, Karen Black, Will Shortz, Liya Kebede, Questlove, Famke Janssen, Moby, Gale Harold, Paz de la Huerta, Jorgen Leth, Rosie Perez, Aubrey de Grey, and Alan Cumming.

From 2016 to 2020, Winger starred opposite Sam Elliott and Ashton Kutcher in the Netflix multi-cam comedy &quot;The Ranch&quot;.

In 2017, Winger had a cameo as Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan in the TV miniseries &quot;When We Rise&quot;. The same year, she starred in her first romantic lead after many years in &quot;The Lovers&quot;. She has continued to acquire roles in other feature films, such as &quot;Tiger City&quot;, released in 2018.

===Other pursuits===
In 1995, Winger performed in &quot;The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True&quot;, a television musical performance of the popular 1939 MGM film at Lincoln Center to benefit the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund. Her roles in that special were the &quot;Cyclone&quot; narrator and the Wicked Witch of the West. It was originally broadcast on both TBS and TNT.

During her hiatus from the film industry, Winger spent a semester as a teaching fellow at Harvard University. In 2008, she wrote a book, &quot;Undiscovered&quot;, based on her personal recollections. She has shown her support for reconciliation between Arabs and Jews in Israel by visiting the bilingual Hand in Hand schools (Galilee Jewish-Arab School, Gesher al HaWadi School) where, in 2008, she said she would &quot;dedicate the next bit of my life to these schools&quot;.

In 2010, Winger was co-executive producer of the Academy Award-nominated documentary &quot;Gasland&quot;. She was also the executive producer of the 2012 documentary &quot;Bel Borba Aqui&quot;, about the life and works of Brazilian graphic artist Bel Borba.

==Personal life==
Winger&#x27;s three-year relationship with actor Andrew Rubin ended in 1980. From 1983 to 1985 she dated Bob Kerrey, at the time the governor of Nebraska, whom she met while filming &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; in Lincoln, Nebraska. Winger also dated her &quot;Cannery Row&quot; and &quot;Everybody Wins&quot; co-star Nick Nolte.

From 1986 to 1990, Winger was married to actor Timothy Hutton, with whom she had a son, Noah Hutton, a documentary filmmaker born in 1987. The marriage ended in divorce.

In 1996, Winger married actor/director Arliss Howard, whom she met on the set of the film &quot;Wilder Napalm&quot;. Their son, Gideon Babe Ruth Howard (known as Babe), was born in 1997. She is stepmother to Sam Howard, Arliss&#x27;s son from his prior marriage.

<doc id="242539" wikidata="Q1132575" url="?curid=242539" title="An Officer and a Gentleman">
<text>An Officer and a Gentleman is a 1982 American romantic drama film directed by Taylor Hackford from a screenplay by Douglas Day Stewart, and starring Richard Gere, Debra Winger, and Louis Gossett Jr. It tells the story of Zack Mayo (Gere), a United States Navy Aviation Officer Candidate who is beginning his training at Aviation Officer Candidate School. While Zack meets his first true girlfriend during his training, a young &quot;townie&quot; named Paula (Winger), he also comes into conflict with the hard-driving Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley (Gossett) training his class.

The film was commercially released in the US on August 13, 1982. It was well received by critics, with a number calling it the best film of 1982. It also was a financial success, grossing $190 million against a budget of $7.5 million. Gossett won the Golden Globe Award, as well as the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, making him the first African-American actor to win in that category. The film also received Oscar nominations for Best Actress (for Winger), Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing, and Best Original Score, also winning for Best Original Song (for &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot;).

==Plot==
After his mother&#x27;s suicide, adolescent Zachary &quot;Zack&quot; Mayo was sent to live with his alcoholic womanizing father, Byron, a US Navy petty officer stationed in the Philippines. Now an adult, Zack, a college graduate, reports to Port Rainier, an Aviation Officer Candidate School (AOCS), located near Port Townsend, Washington. Zack surprises Byron by announcing his intention to become a Navy jet pilot.

Upon arrival, Zack and his fellow recruits meet Marine Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley, their stern, no-nonsense drill instructor. Foley warns that mentally or physically unfit Naval officer candidates will be dismissed. Male candidates are also warned about &quot;Puget Sound Debs&quot;, local girls aspiring to marry a Naval Aviator. Soon after, Zack and fellow candidate, Sid Worley, meet two young factory workers, Paula Pokrifki and Lynette Pomeroy, at a Navy dance. Zack begins a relationship with Paula, while Sid dates Lynette.

Zack is eventually caught peddling contraband uniform accessories to cash-strapped candidates so they can pass inspections. Foley punishes Zack with a weekend of rigorous hazing to force his resignation, saying he lacks the character to be an officer. When Zack refuses to quit, Foley dismisses him from the program. Zack breaks down and admits to having no options in civilian life. Foley relents and assigns Zack to cleaning work.

Paula&#x27;s mother and younger sister appear enchanted with Zack but her stepfather is somewhat hostile. Zack later learns that Paula&#x27;s absent biological father was an officer candidate who abandoned Paula&#x27;s mother when she became pregnant. As it nears time to transfer to another base for the next training phase, Zack ends his and Paula&#x27;s relationship.

During the final obstacle-course run, rather than break the base&#x27;s course record, Zack stops to encourage his teammate, Casey Seeger, to complete the run so she can graduate. Zack learns that, after Sid is commissioned, he is expected to marry his late brother&#x27;s fiancée. Meanwhile, Lynette tells Sid she may be pregnant.

After a severe anxiety attack during a high-altitude simulation in a pressure chamber, Sid quits the program. He proposes to Lynette, saying that he never wanted a military career and was only assuming his deceased brother&#x27;s role to please his family. Lynette is thrilled until she hears he quit the training. She tells him the pregnancy was a false alarm. Sid still wants them to marry and move back to Oklahoma where he can resume his old JC Penney&#x27;s job. A stunned Lynnette rejects Sid, saying she wanted to marry a naval aviator and live overseas. A dejected Sid leaves. Zack and Paula arrive soon after, looking for Sid. Zack accuses Lynette of faking being pregnant, which she denies.

Zack and Paula find Sid at a motel where he has hanged himself. Blaming himself, Zack heads back to the base, intending to quit. He angrily confronts Foley, who refuses Zack&#x27;s resignation and challenges him to settle their differences in martial arts combat. Zack lands several blows on a surprised Foley before the latter incapacitates Zack; he says it is Zack&#x27;s choice to quit.

Zack completes his training and is commissioned as an officer. Following tradition, he and the other graduates receive their first salute from Foley. Zack thanks Foley for not giving up on him. Before Zack departs, he sees Foley greeting the new recruits.

Zack then surprises Paula at her workplace. They embrace and he carries her out in his arms to her colleagues&#x27; applause, including Lynette.

== Cast ==
== Production ==

===Writing===
The film was based on Douglas Day Stewart&#x27;s own experiences as a Naval Aviation Officer Candidate. Stewart had enrolled with the intention of becoming a pilot, but was later disqualified due to a medical issue, and was transferred to a unit overseeing the transportation of 7th Marine Regiment to Vietnam. After leaving the navy, he found success as a television and film screenwriter, and decided to write a script based on anecdotes from Candidate School.

The character Paula was based on a local factory worker whom he&#x27;d had a relationship with during Candidate School, though he did not go on to marry her.

=== Casting ===
Originally, folk music singer and occasional actor John Denver was signed to play Zack Mayo. But a casting process eventually involved Jeff Bridges, Harry Hamlin, Christopher Reeve, John Travolta, and Richard Gere. Gere eventually beat all the other actors for the part. Travolta had turned down the role, as he did with &quot;American Gigolo&quot; (another Richard Gere hit).

The role of Paula was originally given to Sigourney Weaver, then to Anjelica Huston and later to Jennifer Jason Leigh, who dropped out to do the film &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; instead. Eventually, Debra Winger replaced Leigh for the role of Paula. Rebecca De Mornay, Meg Ryan, and Geena Davis auditioned for the role of Paula.

In spite of the strong on-screen chemistry between Gere and Winger, the actors did not get along during filming. Publicly, she called him a &quot;brick wall&quot; while he admitted there was &quot;tension&quot; between them. Thirty years later, Gere was complimentary toward Winger when he said that she was much more open to the camera than he was, and he appreciated the fact that she presented him with an award at the Rome Film Festival.

R. Lee Ermey was originally considered for the role of Gunnery Sgt. Emil Foley due to his time of being an actual drill instructor for the United States Marine Corps at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego in the 1960s. However, Taylor Hackford instead cast Louis Gossett Jr. and had Ermey coach him for his role as the film&#x27;s technical advisor. It was there where the &quot;steers and queers&quot; comment from Gossett&#x27;s character in the 1982 movie came from, which was later used for Ermey&#x27;s role in the 1987 film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;. James Woods was also considered for the role, but turned it down as he didn&#x27;t want to play a drill sergeant.

Hackford kept Gossett Jr. in separate living quarters from other actors during production so Gossett could intimidate them more during his scenes as drill instructor. In addition to R. Lee Ermey, Gossett was advised by Gunnery Sergeant Buck Welscher, an actual drill instructor at Aviation Officer Candidate School, NAS Pensacola. He can be seen leading the senior class after the run.

=== Filming locations ===
The film was shot on April 20, 1981 on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, at Port Townsend and Fort Worden. The US Navy did not permit filming at NAS Pensacola in the Florida panhandle, the site of the actual Aviation Officer Candidate School in 1981. Deactivated US Army base Fort Worden stood in for the location of the school, an actual Naval Air Station in the Puget Sound area, NAS Whidbey Island.

A motel in Port Townsend, the Tides Inn on Water Street (), was used for the film. A plaque outside a room at the motel noted it as a filming location, although the room has been extensively refurbished. Some early scenes of the movie were filmed in Bremerton, with ships of the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in the background.

The &quot;Dilbert Dunker&quot; scenes were filmed in the swimming pool at what is now Mountain View Elementary School (Port Townsend Jr. High School during filming). According to the director&#x27;s commentary on the DVD, the dunking machine was constructed specifically for the film and was an exact duplicate of the actual one used by the navy. , Mountain View Elementary was closed and was home to the Mountain View Commons, which holds the police station, fire station, food bank, methadone clinic, counseling center, homeless shelter and the YMCA, the last of which holds the pool.

The filming location of Paula Pokrifiki&#x27;s house was 1003 Tremont in Port Townsend. As of 2009, the house was shrouded by a large hedge, and the front porch had been remodeled. The neighboring homes and landscape look identical to their appearance in the film, including the &quot;crooked oak tree&quot; across the street from the Pokrifiki home. This oak tree is visible in the scene near the end of the film in which Richard Gere returns to the home to request Paula&#x27;s help in finding his friend Sid. In the film, the plot has Paula leaving on a ferry ride away from the naval base. In reality, Paula&#x27;s home is located approximately 8 blocks from Fort Worden.

Lynette Pomeroy&#x27;s house was located on Mill Road, just west of the main entrance of the Port Townsend Paper Corp. mill. The house no longer exists, but the concrete driveway pad is still visible.

The interior of the USO building at Fort Worden State Park was used for the reception scene near the beginning of the film.
The concrete structure used during the famous Richard Gere line &quot;I got nowhere else to go!&quot; is the Battery Kinzie located at Fort Worden State Park. The scene was filmed on the southwest corner of the upper level of the battery. The &quot;obstacle course&quot; was constructed specifically for the film and was located in the grassy areas just south and southeast of Battery Kinzie.

The decompression chamber was one of the only sets constructed for the film and , it was still intact in the basement of building number 225 of the Fort Worden State Park. It can be seen through the windows of the building&#x27;s basement.

Building 204 of Fort Worden State Park was used as the dormitory and its porch was used for the film&#x27;s closing &quot;silver dollar&quot; scene.

The blimp hangar used for the famous fight scene between Louis Gossett Jr. and Richard Gere is located at Fort Worden State Park and is still intact, but has been converted into a 1200-seat performing arts center called the McCurdy Pavilion.

The filming location for the exterior of &quot;TJ&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; is located at the Point Hudson Marina in Port Townsend. The space is now occupied by a company that makes sails. The fictional &quot;TJ&#x27;s&quot; is an homage to the Trader Jon&#x27;s bar in Pensacola, Florida, as a naval aviator hangout until it closed later in November 2003. For years, it was traditional for graduating Aviation Officer Candidate School classes to celebrate their commissioning at &quot;Trader&#x27;s.&quot; Filming ended on June 2, 1981 after 43 days.

=== Props ===
Richard Gere rides a 750cc T140E Triumph Bonneville. Paramount purchased two of the motorcycles from Dewey&#x27;s Cycle Shop in Seattle. The stunt bike is on display in the Planet Hollywood restaurant, Orlando, Florida. In the United Kingdom, Paramount linked with Triumph Motorcycles (Meriden) Ltd on a mutual promotion campaign. Triumph&#x27;s then-chairman, John Rosamond, in his book &quot;Save The Triumph Bonneville!&quot; (Veloce 2009), states it was agreed cinemas showing the film would be promoted at their local Triumph dealer, and T140E Triumph Bonnevilles supplied by the dealer would be displayed in the cinema&#x27;s foyers.

=== Ending ===
Richard Gere balked at shooting the ending of the film, in which Zack arrives at Paula&#x27;s factory wearing his naval dress whites and carries her off the factory floor. Gere thought the ending would not work because it was too sentimental. Director Taylor Hackford agreed with Gere until, during a rehearsal, the extras playing the workers began to cheer and cry. When Gere saw the scene later, with a portion of the score (that was used to write &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot;) played at the right tempo, he said it gave him chills. Gere is now convinced Hackford made the right decision. Screenwriter Michael Hauge, in his book &quot;Writing Screenplays That Sell&quot;, echoed this opinion: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that those who criticized this Cinderella-style ending were paying very close attention to who exactly is rescuing whom.&quot;

== Release ==
Two versions of the film exist. The original, an uncensored R-rated cut and an edited-for-broadcast television cut (which first aired on NBC in 1986) are nearly identical. The main difference is that the nudity and a majority of the foul language are edited out when the film airs on regular television. However, the group marching song near the beginning of the film and Mayo&#x27;s solo marching song are not voiceover edits; they are reshoots of those scenes for television. Also, the sex scene between Mayo and Paula is cut in half, and the scene where Mayo finds Sid&#x27;s naked body hanging in the shower is also edited.

===Home media===
The film has been available on various formats, first on VHS and also DVD. It was first released on DVD in 2000 with two extra features, audio commentary and film trailer. It was released as a collectors edition in 2007 with new bonus material. The film debuted on Blu-ray in the US by Warner Bros. and UK by Paramount Pictures in 2013, however the same bonus features ported from the 2007 DVD are only on the US release. It was re-released in 2017 by Paramount Pictures.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
&quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; was an enormous box office success and went on to become the third-highest-grossing film of 1982, after &quot;E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial&quot; and &quot;Tootsie&quot;. It grossed $3,304,679 in its opening weekend and $130 million dollars overall at the US and Canadian box office. It sold an estimated 44 million tickets in the US and Canada. Internationally, it grossed $60 million for a worldwide gross of $190 million dollars.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; was well received by critics and is widely considered one of the best films of 1982. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 79% based on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Old-fashioned without sacrificing its characters to simplicity, &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; successfully walks the fine line between sweeping romance and melodrama.&quot; On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100 based on eight critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, and described it as &quot;a wonderful movie precisely because it&#x27;s so willing to deal with matters of the heart...it takes chances, takes the time to know and develop its characters, and by the time this movie&#x27;s wonderful last scene comes along, we know exactly what&#x27;s happening, and why, and it makes us very happy.&quot;
Rex Reed gave a glowing review where he commented: &quot;This movie will make you feel ten feet tall!&quot; British film critic Mark Kermode, an admirer of Taylor Hackford, observed, &quot;It&#x27;s a much tougher film than people remember it being; it&#x27;s not a romantic movie, it&#x27;s actually a movie about blue-collar, down-trodden people.&quot;

<text>VFW-Fokker GmbH was a joint venture of Fokker and Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW) started in 1969 that, from then on, controlled the ERNO initiative.

The Entwicklungsring Nord (Northern development circle) — abbreviated ERNO — was a 1961 joint venture of Bremen-based Weserflug and Focke-Wulf with Hamburger Flugzeugbau to develop parts for rockets and get involved in space activities.

VFW-Fokker 614

In 1961 work began on a small, jet-powered transport aircraft initially styled Erno-61-4. After Weserflug and Focke Wulf formally merged into Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW) in 1964, the machine was redesignated VFW 614. The draft design was amended to a STOL 40-44 passenger jet with overwing engines, for easier operation from unprepared runways. German government subsidies enabled development to start in earnest in 1966. The first prototype started in August 1968, but then VFW and Fokker of the Netherlands formed a joint transnational holding company.

The prototype flew on July 14, 1971, but crashed next February. Two more prototypes flew in 1972. German, FAA, and French DGA certifications completed in 1974, 1975, and 1976 respectively. The collaborative production arrangements involved Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) in Germany, Fokker VFW in the Netherlands and SABCA and Fairey in Belgium. The first sale was to Cimber Air, which started commercial flights in November 1975.

The VFW-Fokker alliance affected the VFW 614 negatively, as Fokker needed to sell its competing F27 and F28. National subsidies were diverted to the Airbus program, and the end came for the VFW-614. On August 19, 1977, the nineteenth (including prototypes) and last machine was completed.

Few VFW 614 aircraft remained in use. Only the Koln/Bonn Flugbereitschaft der Luftwaffe continued flying VFW 614 until they finally ceased in 1998. Only DLR in Braunschweig (region) and EADS Airbus at Bremen now retain the machines for research duties.

Other developments

VFW-Fokker teamed with Republic Aviation to develop the &quot;D-24 Alliance&quot; Variable sweep wing VTOL aircraft as part of the AVS (&quot;Advanced Vertical Strike&quot;).

The European Space Agency ESA in June 1974 named a consortium headed by ERNO-VFW Fokker (Zentralgesellschaft VFW-Fokker GmbH) to build pressurized modules for Spacelab. British Aerospace, under contract to ERNO-VFW Fokker, built five -long, unpressurized, U-shaped pallet segments.

West Germany provided 53.3% of Spacelab&#x27;s cost and fulfilled 52.6% of all Spacelab work contracts. ERNO VFW Fokker, in competition with MBB, submitted the winning design, and became the prime contractor for Spacelab. MBB in 1981 took over VFW Fokker. The ERNO plant in Bremen continued as the headquarters for Spacelab design, production management, component testing, and assembly. Today, it is a part of EADS Astrium Space Transportation.

<text>Testament is a 1983 American post-apocalyptic drama film co-produced and directed by Lynne Littman and written by John Sacret Young, based on Carol Amen&#x27;s 1981 short story &quot;The Last Testament&quot;. The film tells the story of how a small suburban town near the San Francisco Bay Area slowly falls apart after a nuclear war destroys outside civilization. The cast includes Jane Alexander, William Devane, Leon Ames, Ross Harris, Lukas Haas, Roxana Zal and, in small roles shortly before their rise to stardom, Kevin Costner and Rebecca De Mornay. It was one of the films, along with &quot;The Day After&quot; and &quot;Threads&quot; that portrayed life after a nuclear war, mostly in response to an increase in hostility between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Originally produced for the PBS series &quot;American Playhouse&quot;, it was given a theatrical release instead by Paramount Pictures on November 4, 1983 (although PBS did subsequently air it a year later). Alexander was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.

The Wetherly family — husband Tom, wife Carol, and children Brad, Mary Liz, and Scottie — live in the fictional suburb of Hamelin, California, north of Santa Rosa, California. Tom, the breadwinner, works nearby in San Francisco.

On a routine afternoon, Carol listens to an answering machine message from Tom saying he is on his way home for dinner. Scottie watches &quot;Sesame Street&quot; on TV when the show is suddenly replaced by white noise; after a few seconds, a San Francisco news anchor appears onscreen, saying they have lost their New York signal and there are radar indications of explosions of &quot;nuclear devices up and down the East Coast.&quot; The anchorman is cut off by the Emergency Broadcast System tone. An announcer&#x27;s voice states that the White House is interrupting the program, but the blinding flash of a nuclear detonation is seen through the window and the broadcast goes dead. The family huddles on the floor in panic as the town&#x27;s air-raid sirens go off; minutes later, several of their neighbors are seen running around on the street outside, dazed in fear and confusion. The family tries to remain calm, hoping Tom is safe.

Hamelin seems to survive relatively unscathed. Frightened residents meet at the home of Henry Abhart, an elderly ham radio operator. He has made contact with survivors in rural areas but reveals that the entire Bay Area and all major U.S. cities are radio-silent. Larry, a local boy who lost his parents, moves in with the Wetherleys but succumbs to radiation poisoning. The school play about the Pied Piper of Hamelin was in rehearsal before the bombings; desperate to recapture some normality, the town decides to go on with the show. The parents smile and applaud, many of them in tears. The day after the attack, the children noticed contaminated fallout dirt settling on solid surfaces as a result of the blast. Residents now have to cope with losing municipal services, food and gas shortages, and the loss of loved ones to radiation poisoning. Scottie, the first to succumb, is buried in the backyard. Carol frantically searches for his teddy bear as the local priest prepares for his burial in the backyard of the home due to cemetery overwhelm. As the dead accumulate faster than the manpower to bury them, wooden caskets are used as fuel for funeral pyres later, and Carol sews together a burial shroud from bedsheets for her daughter, Mary Liz, who also dies from radiation exposure.

While the young die, older residents fall to rapid dementia, and order in the town starts to break down as police and firefighter ranks dwindle. With no one to renovate homes and no purpose to do so, properties, roads, and the physical appearances of survivors steadily deteriorate as radiation poisoning and social disintegration take their toll. A young couple leaves town after losing their infant, hoping to find safety and solace elsewhere. Carol&#x27;s search for a battery causes her to listen once more to her husband&#x27;s final message on the answering machine. To her sorrow, she finds a later (and previously unheard) message on the machine from Tom: he decided to stay at work late in San Francisco on the day of the attack, and she gives up hope that he will return home. Brad, Carol&#x27;s last surviving child, helps his mother and takes over the radio for Henry Abhart. They adopt a mentally-disabled boy named Hiroshi who Tom used to take fishing along with his children after Hiroshi&#x27;s father, Mike, died. Soon thereafter Carol starts showing signs of radiation poisoning. Carol decides she, Brad, and Hiroshi should avoid a slow and painful death from radiation poisoning and instead take their own lives via carbon monoxide poisoning. They gather in the family&#x27;s station wagon with the engine running and the garage door closed, but Carol cannot bring herself to go through with the deed. They are finally seen sitting by candlelight to celebrate Brad&#x27;s birthday, using a graham cracker in place of a cake. When asked what they should wish for, Carol answers: &quot;That we remember it all...the good and the awful.&quot; She blows out the candle. Although it is not depicted, it is probably inevitable that Carol, Brad, and Hiroshi subsequently succumb to radiation poisoning after the end of the film narrative.

An old family home movie of a surprise birthday party for Tom plays, showing him as he blows out the candles on his cake. As there have been prior clips of Scottie and Mary-Elizabeth after their respective deaths, this may imply that the last survivors of the Wetherly family have also perished.

==Background==

&quot;Testament&quot; was based upon a three-page short story written by Carol Amen, an American writing teacher whose story was published in the August 1981 issue of &quot;Ms. Magazine&quot;. Kyle Raymond Fitzpatrick of &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books&quot; traced Amen&#x27;s story to a number of other 1980s periodical publications, stating, &quot;The appearance of Amen’s “The Last Testament” in [&quot;Ms. Magazine&quot;] was actually a reprint: the story originally ran in the September 1980 issue of the &quot;St. Anthony Messenger&quot;, an Ohio-based religious magazine published by the Franciscan Friars, with a circulation of roughly 350,000 in the 1980s. The story was written 14 years prior to the movie’s release, according to a feature on Amen that appeared in &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; in October 1983.&quot;

Amen died from cancer in 1987; according to an article in &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; released one week before her death, &quot;Mrs. Amen taught writing at area adult schools and colleges. She wrote a three-page story she called “Last Testament” that appeared in print in 1981. It described a family in a small Northern California town and how it coped in the aftermath of a nuclear explosion.&quot;

==Production==
&quot;Testament&quot; was shot entirely on location in the town of Sierra Madre, California, a suburb community of Los Angeles located in the San Gabriel Valley.

==Reception and legacy==
===Initial===
&quot;Testament&quot; received positive reviews from the few critics who got the opportunity to see it. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 89% based on reviews from 45 critics.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars out of four, and was highly enthusiastic about the film. Ebert wrote that the film was powerful and made him cry, even after the second time he watched it. Ebert wrote: &quot;The film is about a suburban American family, and what happens to that family after a nuclear war. It is not a science-fiction movie, and it doesn&#x27;t have any special effects, and there are no big scenes of buildings blowing over or people disintegrating. We never even see a mushroom cloud. We never even know who started the war. Instead, &quot;Testament&quot; is a tragedy about manners: It asks how we might act toward one another, how our values might stand up, in the face of an overwhelming catastrophe.&quot;

Christopher John reviewed &quot;Testament&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; Special Edition #2 and commented that &quot;&quot;Testament&quot; may not change any lives, but it is bound to change the way some people think. Considering the subject matter, every little bit will help.&quot;

===Carol Amen&#x27;s reception===
According to Carol Amen&#x27;s close friend Patt Tubs in a 2020 interview, the author &quot;was happy [the story] was going to be a movie. They showed the movie at church a few times, and I don’t remember her being super excited about it. It certainly wasn’t what she expected.”

===Awards and nominations===
===Retrospective===
&quot;Testament&quot; has had positive retrospective reviews. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; has listed the film as one of the best science fiction movies directed by a woman, noting that it &quot;went on to inspire other speculative war disaster media such as the TV show &quot;Jericho&quot;.&quot; Jacqueline Foertsch wrote that, in contrast to &quot;a sizable majority of postapocalyptic and science fiction texts authored by Western male authors,&quot; Testament does not &quot;ignore the reality of nuclear catastrophe&quot; and &quot;emphasize[s] threats to the well-being of families.&quot; &quot;Tor.com&quot;, in a piece on dystopian science fiction, called &quot;Testament&quot; &quot;a realistic vision of the world we might live in after the bombs drop&quot; and &quot;quiet, brilliant little movie.&quot; Film critic Alexandra Heller-Nicholas wrote that &quot;Testament&quot; &quot;utilises sci-fi to communicate a political message and remains a fascinating vision of life after a nuclear war&quot; and &quot;it remains a powerful but often widely forgotten sci-fi treasure.&quot; &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; calls it &quot;potent and sentimental&quot; and notes that it &quot;seems not interested in causes, only in effects – in marked contrast to &quot;The Day After&quot;, made the same year.&quot;

The Science Fiction Handbook contrasts the film and others from the decade against 1950s/1960s dystopian films such as &quot;On the Beach&quot;, &quot;World Without End&quot; and &quot;Panic in the Year Zero&quot; by stating how &quot;other post-holocaust films of the long 1950s were even more indirect in their representation of nuclear war and its aftermath: graphic on-screen depictions of the actual effects of nuclear war were rare until the mid-1980s, when a spate of such films appeared, including &quot;The Day After&quot; (1983), &quot;Testament&quot; (1983), and &quot;Threads&quot; (1984).&quot;

===Home media===
&quot;Testament&quot; was released by Paramount Home Video on Beta, VHS videocassette, Laserdisc and RCA&#x27;s CED System in 1984.

The film was released on DVD in 2004 in an edition that contained three featurettes: &quot;Testament at 20&quot;, &quot;Testament: Nuclear Thoughts&quot;, and &quot;Timeline of the Nuclear Age&quot;; this edition has since gone out of print.

As part of its 2013 agreement with Paramount Pictures, Warner Home Video made the film available in 2014 for purchase on MOD (Manufactured on Demand) DVD Recordable disc via its Warner Archive Collection.

The Australian specialty home video reissue distributor Imprint Films released the film on Blu-ray disc in late 2022 in an edition limited to 1500 copies.

<text>Sports memorabilia are collectables associated with sports, including equipment, trophies, sports cards, autographs, and photographs. A multi-billion-dollar industry has grown around the trading of sports memorabilia.

==Monetary value==
Items that have been in direct contact with a famous athlete can have significant monetary value. Game-used items such as a ball Mark McGwire hit for his 70th home run of the 1998 season, sold for $3 million. The most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold was a New York Yankees baseball jersey worn by Babe Ruth during his &#x27;called shot&#x27; game in the 1932 World Series. It sold for $24.12 million in 2024. In 2016, the ten most valuable sports cards and memorabilia sold for a record-setting combined $12,186,294. The highest price fetched for an association football shirt is $224,000. The shirt belonged to Pelé, who wore it during the 1970 World Cup final in which Brazil went on to win. Collectors of sports memorabilia may seek to authenticate items to prove their veracity. Autographed items are nearly always more valuable than non-autographed items.

Sports memorabilia items are considered good investments by collectors, as the industry and prices of items grow rapidly.

==Popular items==

In the sports memorabilia industry, there are two main focuses of collectors: autographed cards and tickets, and used clothing and equipment. Signed cards and tickets are preferred in pristine condition, while used uniforms are considered to be more desirable when they are unwashed, as stains from dirt, grass, blood, and sweat add value. Unique or odd items are also highly collectible, and items such as hair, floorboards, and chairs from stadiums have sold for large quantities of money. &quot;Rookie&quot; memorabilia, meaning items from an athlete&#x27;s first year as a professional player, are valued by collectors. Rookie cards are often considered by collectors to be the most desirable kind of trading cards.

At the Olympic Games, there is a thriving market for collectible lapel pins. Various pins representing media organizations, sponsors, athletes, nations, and mascots are distributed, and athletes and attendees often engage in pin trading amongst themselves to collect them. The tradition began at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, where cardboard pins were worn by coaches, athletes, and reporters for identification. Some pins have become highly coveted by collectors, including a pin from the 2016 Summer Olympics featuring an image of Pikachu and a pin from the 2024 Summer Olympics featuring an image of Snoop Dogg.

<doc id="242548" wikidata="Q1412037" url="?curid=242548" title="Silkwood">
<text>Silkwood is a 1983 American biographical drama film directed by Mike Nichols, and starring Meryl Streep, Kurt Russell, and Cher. The screenplay by Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen was adapted from the book &quot;Who Killed Karen Silkwood?&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer and activist Howard Kohn, which detailed the life of Karen Silkwood, a nuclear whistle-blower and a labor union activist who investigated alleged wrongdoing at the Kerr-McGee plutonium plant where she worked. In real life, her inconclusive death in a car crash gave rise to a 1979 lawsuit, &quot;Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee&quot;, led by attorney Gerry Spence. The jury rendered its verdict of $10 million in damages to be paid to the Silkwood estate (her children), the largest amount in damages ever awarded for that kind of case at the time. The Silkwood estate eventually settled for $1.3 million.

The development of &quot;Silkwood&quot; spanned nine years, with the project originating with Warner Bros., who intended to cast Jane Fonda as Silkwood. Warner Bros. ultimately abandoned the project after producer Buzz Hirsch was subpoenaed by an Oklahoma City judge to disclose all of the film&#x27;s research materials, an effort that was overruled by a 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. The project was later acquired by ABC Motion Pictures, with Nichols directing and Streep cast in the title role. &quot;Silkwood&quot; was shot largely in New Mexico and Texas on a budget of $10 million. Factual accuracy was maintained throughout the script. One scene in particular involved Silkwood activating a radiation alarm at the plant; Silkwood herself had forty times the legal limit of radioactive contamination in her system.

Streep had just finished filming &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1982) when production began. The film marked a departure for some of its stars: it is noted for being one of the first serious works of Cher, who had been previously known mostly for her singing, and for Russell, who was at the time widely known for his work in the action genre.

The film received positive reviews and was a box office success, with particular attention focused on Nichols&#x27; direction and Streep&#x27;s performance. At the 56th Academy Awards, &quot;Silkwood&quot; received five nominations in total, including Streep for Best Actress, Cher for Best Supporting Actress and Nichols for Best Director.

==Plot==
Karen Silkwood, a worker at the Kerr-McGee Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site (near Crescent, Oklahoma), shares a ramshackle house with two co-workers, her boyfriend Drew Stephens and her lesbian friend Dolly Pelliker. She makes MOX fuel rods for nuclear reactors, where she deals with the threat of exposure to radiation. She has become a union activist, concerned that corporate practices may adversely affect the health of workers. She is also engaged in a conflict with her former common-law husband in an effort to have more time with their three children.

Because the plant has ostensibly fallen behind on a major contract – fabricating MOX fuel rods for a breeder reactor at the Hanford Site in Washington state – employees are required to work long hours and weekends of overtime. She believes that managers are falsifying safety reports and cutting corners wherever possible, risking the welfare of the personnel. Karen approaches the union with her concerns and becomes active in lobbying for safeguards. She travels to Washington, D.C. to testify before the Atomic Energy Commission.

When Silkwood and other workers become contaminated by radiation, plant officials try to blame her for the incident. When she sees weld sample radiographies of fuel rods being retouched to hide shoddy work, and that records of inadequate safety measures had been altered, she decides to investigate further herself. Complications arise in her personal life when Angela, a funeral parlour beautician, joins the household as Dolly&#x27;s lover. Unable to deal with Silkwood&#x27;s obsession with gathering evidence, and suspecting her of infidelities, Drew moves out.

Once she feels she has gathered sufficient documentation, Silkwood contacts a journalist from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and arranges a nighttime meeting. She first attends a union meeting, carrying documentation of her findings on her way to meet with the journalist. En route, she sees approaching headlights in her rear-view mirror, which draw so close that they distract and blind her, preventing her from seeing the road ahead, leading to her fatal one-car crash. No documents are found in the wreckage of her car.

==Production==
===Development===
Development of a film adaptation of Karen Silkwood&#x27;s life spanned approximately nine years before the film began production. Executive producers Buzz Hirsch and Larry Cano, while both graduate students at the University of California, Los Angeles, became fascinated by Silkwood&#x27;s story and sought to bring it to the screen. Within a year of graduating, Hirsch and Cano began developing the project. Warner Bros. initially expressed interest in producing the film with Jane Fonda portraying Silkwood, but the project dissipated after the Silkwood estate filed a lawsuit against Kerr-McGee, Silkwood&#x27;s former employer. Kerr-McGee subsequently subpoenaed Hirsch to appear at a deposition in Oklahoma City, requesting that he produce all of the audition tapes, script notes, and other research materials for the studio&#x27;s planned film adaptation. Federal Judge Luther Eubanks ruled in Kerr-McGee&#x27;s favor, requiring that Hirsch disclose all research materials acquired for the film. 
In June 1977, a 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, Colorado, agreed to hear Hirsch&#x27;s appeal of Eubanks&#x27; ruling, with the Writers Guild of America West voting to lend legal assistance to Hirsch in the process, declaring they would file an &quot;amicus curiae&quot;, &quot;arguing that Hirsch has a First Amendment right to shield his film materials from subpoena.&quot; In September that year, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Eubanks&#x27; ruling, ordering additional proceedings in Oklahoma City.

In the fall of 1980, ABC Motion Pictures began revamping Hirsch&#x27;s original project with Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen writing the screenplay. Producer Frank Yablans, though not credited on the film, was involved in the project&#x27;s development and was approached by director Mike Nichols, who was hired to direct.

===Casting===
Meryl Streep was cast as Karen Silkwood in October 1981. Nichols cast Cher in the role of Silkwood&#x27;s lesbian roommate, Dolly Pelliker, after seeing her in the Broadway production of &quot;Come Back to the 5 &amp; Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot;, feeling she possessed the necessary &quot;vitality, humor and surprising depth.&quot;

===Filming===
The film was shot on location in Albuquerque and Los Alamos in New Mexico, and Dallas, Howe, Texas City, and Tom Bean in Texas from September 7 to November 26, 1982. Arthur Hirsch and Larry Cano were the producers of the film and received Executive Producer credits. They began working on the movie while graduate film students at UCLA. Their involvement in the making of &quot;Silkwood&quot; set a precedent in the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the protection under the First Amendment of confidential sources for film-makers, as is done for journalists.

==Release==
On December 8, 1983, 20th Century Fox held a local community screening of the film in Oklahoma City, inviting five executives from Kerr-McGee to attend. Only one of the company&#x27;s employees, communications manager Ann Adams, attended. Following the screening, Adams remarked that the film was a &quot;highly fictionalized dramatization&quot; that depicted the company in a &quot;false and defamatory manner.&quot; The film premiered the following week in the United States, on December 14, 1983, in a limited theatrical release showing at 257 theaters.

===Box office===
&quot;Silkwood&quot; grossed $1,218,322 during its opening weekend, ranking #12 at the box office. The film opened widely on January 27, 1984, during which, in its seventh week of release, it had expanded to 816 screens and reached #1. It eventually earned a total of $35,615,609 in the U.S. and Canada.

===Critical response===
&quot;Silkwood&quot; received largely favorable reviews from critics. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a precisely visualized, highly emotional melodrama that&#x27;s going to raise a lot of hackles&quot; and &quot;a very moving work.&quot; He added, &quot;There are, however, problems, not unlike those faced by Costa-Gavras in his &quot;State of Siege&quot; and &quot;Missing&quot;, and they are major. Mr. Nichols and his writers ... have attempted to impose a shape on a real-life story that, even as they present it, has no easily verifiable shape. We are drawn into the story of Karen Silkwood by the absolute accuracy and unexpected sweetness of its Middle American details and then, near the end, abandoned by a film whose images say one thing and whose final credit card another. The muddle of fact, fiction and speculation almost, though not quite, denies the artistry of all that&#x27;s gone before.&quot; He concluded, &quot;I realize that films shouldn&#x27;t be judged in bits and pieces, but it&#x27;s difficult not to see &quot;Silkwood&quot; in that way. For most of its running time it is so convincing—and so sure of itself—that it seems a particular waste when it goes dangerously wrong. It&#x27;s like watching a skydiver execute all sorts of graceful, breath-taking turns, as he appears to ignore gravity and fly on his own, only to have him smash to earth when the chute doesn&#x27;t open.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; rated the film four stars and commented, &quot;It&#x27;s a little amazing that established movie stars like Streep, Russell and Cher could disappear so completely into the everyday lives of these characters.&quot;

David Sterritt of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; called the film &quot;a fine example of Hollywood&#x27;s love-hate attitude toward timely and controversial subject matter.&quot; He continued, &quot;The movie sides with Silkwood as a character, playing up her spunk and courage while casting wry, sidelong glances at her failings. When it comes to the issues connected with her, though, the filmmakers slip and slide around, providing an escape hatch ... for every position and opinion they offer. This makes the movie less polemical than it might have been, and a lot more wishy-washy ... This is too bad, because on other levels &quot;Silkwood&quot; is a strong and imaginative film. Meryl Streep gives the year&#x27;s most astounding performance by an actress, adding vigor and complexity to almost every scene with her endlessly inventive portrayal of the eccentric heroine. The supporting players skillfully follow her lead.&quot;

Critic Peter Travers gave the film an unfavorable review, deeming Streep as miscast and the film overall as &quot;preachy,&quot; concluding: &quot;The notion that Eastern Establishment types like Nichols-Ephron-Streep can tell us what it&#x27;s like to be a worker in Oklahoma is nothing if not patronizing.&quot; Angela Bonavoglia of &quot;Cinéaste&quot; similarly noted that the film features some &quot;painfully patronizing moments&quot;, but conceded that it no less &quot;manages an effective portrayal of working class life, especially its monotony and vulnerability.&quot;

The film holds a 77% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 7.60/10. The consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Silkwood&quot; seethes with real-life rage -- but backs it up with compelling characters and trenchant observations.&quot; It also holds a score of 64 out of 100 on Metacritic based on ten reviews.

==Accolades==
===Home media===
Anchor Bay Entertainment released the film on VHS and a region 1 DVD in 1998 and 1999, respectively. The Anchor Bay DVD contained a dual-sided disc featuring both anamorphic widescreen and fullscreen formats. A second region 1 DVD was released by MGM Home Entertainment on October 7, 2003.

The film was broadcast in high definition (1080i) on Sky+ HD. &quot;Silkwood&quot; was released on DVD and Blu-ray from Kino Lorber on July 25, 2017, under license from Walt Disney Studios, who acquired the ABC Film Studios catalogue in 1995. The sales for the Kino Lorber Blu-ray totaled $121,094. The film is available for streaming on HULU in the US.

==Legacy==
&quot;Silkwood&quot; marked a career resurgence for director Nichols, who had not worked in film for nearly a decade prior to the film&#x27;s release.

The American Film Institute included Karen Silkwood as the #47 hero in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains and the film as #66 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers.

<doc id="242549" wikidata="Q5646037" url="?curid=242549" title="Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics">
<text>The Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics (HCSSiM) is an American residential program for mathematically talented high school students. The program has been conducted each summer since 1971, with the exceptions of 1981 and 1996, and has more than 1500 alumni. Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the 2020 Summer Studies ran online for a shortened program of four weeks.

The program was created and is still headed by David Kelly, a professor emeritus of mathematics at Hampshire College.

==Background==
The program is housed at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, and generally runs for six weeks from early July until mid-August. The program itself consists of lectures, study sessions, math workshops (general-knowledge classes), maxi-courses (three-week classes run by the senior staff members), and mini-courses (specialized shorter classes).

On a typical day, students spend four hours in the morning in class, have lunch together with the faculty, and then have several hours to use at their leisure. During this &quot;down time&quot; students and faculty members often host quasis, where they participate in an activity as a small group, such as juggling or making sushi. They return for the &quot;Prime Time Theorem&quot; (an hour-long talk on an interesting piece of mathematics given by a faculty member or a visitor), have dinner, and then spend three hours in a problem solving session. One of the instructors blogged the content of her class.

Many students go on to professional careers in mathematics. An occasional publication has resulted from work done at the program. Well-known alumni of the program include two MacArthur Fellows, Eric Lander and Erik Winfree, as well as Lisa Randall, Dana Randall, and Eugene Volokh. Many alumni return to the campus for a few days around Yellow Pig&#x27;s Day (July 17) of each year. This observance was formalized for 2006 in &quot;Yellow Pig Math Days,&quot; which was conducted in observance of 2006 being the 34th offering of the HCSSiM Program (34 being a multiple of 17).

The Summer Studies has been funded in the past by the American Mathematical Society and the U.S. National Science Foundation.

<doc id="242550" wikidata="Q2521361" url="?curid=242550" title="The Trip to Bountiful">
<text>The Trip to Bountiful is a 1985 American road drama film directed by Peter Masterson and starring Geraldine Page, John Heard, Carlin Glynn, Richard Bradford and Rebecca De Mornay. It was adapted by Horton Foote from his 1953 play. The film features a soundtrack by J.A.C. Redford featuring Will Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Softly and Tenderly&quot; sung by Cynthia Clawson. Geraldine Page won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Mrs. Watts and Horton Foote was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

The film is partially set in the community of Bountiful, a fictitious Texas town. Although part of the film is set in Houston, Texas (as was the original play), the movie was shot in Dallas.

==Plot==
The film, set in the post-World War II 1940s, tells the story of an elderly woman, Carrie Watts, who wants to return to her home, the small, rural, agriculture-based town of Bountiful near the Texas Gulf coast between Houston and Corpus Christi, where she grew up, but she&#x27;s frequently stopped from leaving Houston by her daughter-in-law and her overprotective son, who will not let her travel alone. Her son and daughter-in-law both know that the town has long since disappeared, due to the Depression. Long-term out-migration was caused by the draw-down of all the town&#x27;s able-bodied men to the wartime draft calls and by the demand for industrial workers in the war production plants of the big cities.

Old Mrs. Watts is determined to outwit her son and bossy daughter-in-law, and sets out to catch a train, only to find that trains do not go to Bountiful anymore. She eventually boards a bus to a town near her childhood home. On the journey, she befriends a woman traveling alone and reminisces about her younger years and grieves for her lost relatives. Her son and daughter-in-law eventually track her down, with the help of the local police force; however, Mrs. Watts is determined. The local sheriff, moved by her yearning to visit her girlhood home, offers to drive her out to what remains of Bountiful. The town is deserted and the few remaining structures are derelict. Mrs. Watts learns that the last occupant of the town and the woman with whom she had hoped to live, has recently died. She is moved to tears as she surveys her father&#x27;s land and the remains of the family home. Having accepted the reality of the current condition of Bountiful and knowing that she has reached her goal of returning there before dying, she is ready to return to Houston when her son and daughter-in-law arrive to drive her back. Having confronted their common history in Bountiful, the three commit to live more peacefully together. They begin their drive back to Houston.

==Reception==

===Critical response===

&quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot; received a very positive response from film critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a score of 100% from 10 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. Geraldine Page received particular praise for her performance as Mrs. Watts. &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a superbly crafted drama featuring the performance of a lifetime by Geraldine Page.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as a &quot;funny, exquisitely performed film adaptation of [Foote&#x27;s] own play&quot; and wrote of Page, &quot;Her Mrs. Watts is simultaneously hilarious and crafty, sentimental and unexpectedly tough.&quot; He added, &quot;It&#x27;s a wonderful role, and the performance ranks with the best things Miss Page has done on the screen.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; similarly observed that &quot;Page inhabits the central role with authority and vinegar,&quot; writing, &quot;She&#x27;s not just a sweet and gentle little old lady. She&#x27;s a big old lady, with a streak of stubbornness. And just because she&#x27;s right doesn&#x27;t mean she&#x27;s always all that nice.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; further remarked, &quot;Carrie [Watts] is a performance, a precisely conceived and calculated turn by a gifted professional always aware of what she is doing and the effects she&#x27;s creating. But the test of acting always is that you forget this, surrendering to the certainty that you have been transported back to 1947 and that dark apartment, and are then riding the bus toward Bountiful in the company of this warm and loving old woman. The film gives us an unforgettable portrayal.&quot;

Vincent Canby later included &quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot; in his list of the top ten films of 1985. The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited &quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot; as one of his favorite films.

<doc id="242552" wikidata="Q5744208" url="?curid=242552" title="Agnes of God">
<text>Agnes of God is a 1979 play by American playwright John Pielmeier which tells the story of a novice nun who gives birth but does not believe she has. After the child is found dead, a psychiatrist and the mother superior of the convent clash during the resulting investigation. The title is a pun on the Latin phrase &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; (&quot;lamb of God&quot;).

==Synopsis==
The stage play concerns three main characters: Martha, the psychiatrist; the Mother Superior; and Agnes, the novice. There are no other characters on stage. All three roles are considered demanding for the actors playing them. Martha covers the full gamut of emotion during the play, from nurturer to antagonist, from hard nosed court psychiatrist and atheist to faith-searching healer. She is always on stage and has only three small respites from monologues or dialogue while Agnes and the Mother Superior enact flashbacks to events at the convent. The Mother Superior must expound the possibilities of miracles while recognizing the realities of today&#x27;s world. Agnes is a beautiful but tormented soul whose abusive upbringing has affected her ability to think rationally.

==Historical casting==
==Production history==
The play first was staged at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut in 1979. In 1980, it was further developed at the Actors Theatre of Louisville. Pielmeier had been an actor at both of these venues and had turned to playwriting; he began writing &quot;Agnes of God&quot; in the summer of 1978.

The play opened on Broadway on March 30, 1982 at the Music Box Theatre and closed on September 4, 1983 after 599 performances. Amanda Plummer received the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play, and Page was nominated for Best Actress in a Play. The director was Michael Lindsay-Hogg.

During the run, Elizabeth Ashley was succeeded in her role by Diahann Carroll and Amanda Plummer by Mia Dillon, Carrie Fisher and Maryann Plunkett. Lee Remick played the psychiatrist in the show&#x27;s pre-Broadway run in Boston and was advertised for the New York run but left the show before the New York opening. A national tour was launched in 1983.

In 1983, the play was staged in London at the Greenwich Theatre. A production also was staged at the Center Stage Theatre in Baltimore, Maryland, starring Tania Myren-Zobel as Agnes.

In 1984, the play was staged in Mexico City. The production starred Marga López, María Teresa Rivas and Blanca Guerra in the main roles.

The National Tour starred Ashley, Plunkett, and Mercedes McCambridge. There were also two summer stock productions, one starring Sandy Dennis and Geraldine Page, and the other starring Peggy Cass and Susan Strasberg.

==Film adaptation==

The 1985 film adaptation was directed by Norman Jewison, with a script also written by Pielmeier. It garnered three Academy Award nominations: Meg Tilly was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, Anne Bancroft for Lead Actress for her performance as Mother Miriam, and Best Score. Anne Pitoniak, who played Miriam Ruth in the 1980 cast, also appears in the film, this time as the mother of Dr. Livingston.

==Background==
Pielmeier was inspired to write the play after seeing an article in a newspaper about an event that occurred in a convent in Brighton, New York, just outside the city limits of Rochester. Sister Maureen Murphy, a thirty-six-year-old Montessori teacher, was found bleeding in her room by the other sisters of the convent after she did not come down for meals. Sister Maureen denied she had given birth; when examined by medical staff, she said she could not remember being pregnant. She had covered up the pregnancy by wearing the traditional nun&#x27;s habit. The baby was found dead in her small convent room in a waste basket, asphyxiated.

The police found ticket stubs and other information in the nun&#x27;s room indicating that precisely nine months earlier she had traveled out of state to an educational conference. During the trial, the father of the baby was never named.

At her trial, Sister Maureen waived her right to a jury, and Judge Hyman Maas presided. The trial was over in ten days, and Maas found the nun not guilty of all charges by reason of insanity in March 1977.
The convent where the incident occurred is adjacent to the still-functioning suburban parish and school. The convent is used to house University of Rochester graduate students. The girls&#x27; high school, St. Agnes, where some of the nuns taught, is closed.

<doc id="242554" wikidata="Q2901864" url="?curid=242554" title="Free flight (model aircraft)">
<text>Free flight is the segment of model aviation involving aircraft with no active external control after launch. Free flight is the original form of hobby aeromodeling, with the competitive objective being to build and launch a self controlling aircraft that will consistently achieve the longest flight duration over multiple competition rounds, within various class parameters.

== Description ==

The essence of free-flight is that the aircraft have no need for external control, for instance by radio. Aircraft of this type have been flown for over two centuries. They are designed to be inherently stable in flight; if disturbed by a gust of wind or a thermal current they will return automatically to stable flight. Their stability is achieved by a combination of design and trim, - the relationship between centre of gravity, wing and tailplane incidence and rudder setting.

With their much lower wing loading, free-flight aircraft fly much more slowly than the engine-powered radio-controlled aircraft that many people first think of when ‘model aircraft’ is mentioned. Most of them glide at little more than walking pace and few weigh more than 500 grams.

Usually the sole objective of free-flight competition is flight duration, and one of the sport&#x27;s fascinations and challenges is to design the most efficient aircraft within the various competition limits on parameters such as minimum weight, maximum wing area, and motive power.

== Types ==

Free flight models may be broadly divided into four categories:

* Gliders (towline and hand-launched)
* Rubber-powered (pure duration, and scale with duration)
* Power (CO2, methanol-fueled glow engine, or electric)
* Indoor (pure duration, and scale with duration)

When flown competitively, the usual aim is maximum flight duration. In the case of models flown outdoors, the modeler attempts to launch the model into a rising column of air, a thermal. These outdoor free flight models tend to be designed for two very different flying modes: climbing rapidly under power or tow, and gliding slowly while circling with minimum fall rate. Much of the challenge in designing and flying these models is to maintain aerodynamic stability in both modes and to make a smooth transition between them. Modern models use mechanical or electronic timers to move control surfaces at preset times. Detecting the thermal into which to launch is vital and can involve several methods, ranging from radio telemetered temperature and wind speed measurements plotted on a chart recorder to Mylar streamers or soap bubbles to visualize the rising air.

Competitions normally involve up to seven rounds during the day, each flown to a maximum flight time hard to achieve without thermal assistance. An automatic on-board time switch upsets the trim of the aircraft when the &quot;max&quot; is achieved, to bring the aircraft down safely and quickly. Locating and recovering the aircraft for further flights is an important part of free-flight. Many aircraft carry radio location beacons, and flyers will use GPS, binoculars, a compass, and a directionally sensitive radio tracking receiver to assist them. A day&#x27;s flying and retrieval may well involve or so on foot or on bike, depending on wind strength.

Models flown indoors do not depend on rising air currents, but they must be designed for maximum flight efficiency because of the limited energy stored in the rubber or electric power source.

Within each category, there are different classes. Typically, there is a Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) world-championship class, a so-called &quot;mini&quot; class, an &quot;open&quot; class, and possibly any number of national or unofficial classes, for which regional or national competitions may be held. Within the competition classification codes specified by the FAI, free flight aeromodeling gets the generic code of F1, where the &quot;F&quot; stands for flying model aircraft in general, with the &quot;1&quot; standing specifically for free flight models.

== Gliders ==

Gliders have no onboard motive power. The only energy inputs are the launch, and rising air encountered during the flight. During launch, many gliders withstand 60G or more (far more than the stress on any crewed aircraft) and have launch speeds of sometimes over 140 km/h, where this energy converts to altitude ; this has only become possible since the advent of composite materials such as carbon (graphite), fiberglass, and Kevlar, which are used extensively in many of their structures.

The FAI glider class is F1A, also known as A/2 or Nordic glider. The model must have a projected area (wing and stabilizer) of between 32-34 dm2, and a minimum weight of 410 g. Launch is by hand tow, using a tow line of 50 m length, similar to towing a kite. During the tow phase, the glider can be controlled by letting it glide in tight circles followed by towing it up against the wind. Once the decision is taken to launch the model, the sportsman runs to make the model gain speed. When the model is at maximum speed overhead, the tow line is released and a mechanism frees the tow line from the model which then starts a pre-programmed pattern to convert speed into altitude. Modern F1A gliders can gain sometimes as much as 80 meters of additional altitude. The mini glider class is A/1 (F1H). A/1 gliders must have less than 18 dm2 total area, and weigh at least 220 g. Open glider contests are rarely flown, and most competitors in such contests use F1A gliders. Other glider classes include magnet-steered (F1E) gliders - essentially a free flight slope soaring class, and hand-launched glider (usually abbreviated HLG, and also widely known as simply chuck glider). HLGs are small models which are launched from level ground simply by being thrown hard. This is one of the more athletic of the free flight disciplines.

== Rubber powered ==

Rubber-powered models are powered by the stored energy of a twisted elastic material. These range from the simple rubber-band powered toys available in many toy stores, up to the open rubber class, examples of which often use 200 g of rubber in their &quot;motor&quot;. Rubber does not produce a constant power output; when fully wound a rubber motor produces its maximum torque, but this drops rapidly at first before &#x27;plateauing&#x27;, finally declining again, after which the propeller stops. Using this initial burst efficiently is vital, and automatic variable-pitch propellers help here, together with timer-operated changes of wing and tailplane incidence and of rudder setting. At the end of the power run the blades fold back alongside the fuselage to minimise drag during the glide.

The FAI rubber class is F1B, also known as Wakefield. Charles Dennis Rushing has written on the history of the Wakefield Cup. F1B models may have a maximum of 30 g of rubber motor, and the empty weight of the airframe must be at least 200 g. The maximum total area of the model must be less than 19 dm2.
The mini rubber class is Coupe d&#x27;Hiver (also known as F1G). &quot;Coupe&quot; models have no area restrictions. The maximum weight of rubber allowed is 10 g, and the minimum empty weight of the airframe is 70g. .
Open rubber is a popular event, featuring large models with enormous amounts of rubber crammed into them. Open models often have 50% of their flying weight composed of rubber.

The F1D (see #Indoor below) is a class of delicate, lightweight, slow-flying, long-duration (over 30 minutes) rubber-powered aircraft designed to be flown in a large indoor space.

P-30 is a common beginner&#x27;s event. A P-30 must use an unmodified commercially available plastic propeller. P-30 has a maximum wingspan and overall length of 30 inches (76.2 cm), and uses maximum 10 g of rubber. The empty airframe must weigh at least 40 g. 

The Wright Stuff competition in Science OIympiad is also very popular. The rules and dimension restrictions vary every year, but many notable fliers such as Brett Sanborn started in Science Olympiad. Planes for this competition usually consist of a balsa frame with a mylar-covered wing and a commercially available fixed-pitch propeller. The rubber motor is typically wound with a 15:1 winder. 

The most well known beginner rubber powered models are the AMA Cub (also known in the USA as the &quot;AMA Delta Dart&quot;), Denny Dart, Canarsie Canarie and Squirrel. They are commonly used in workshops or for beginners to learn about construction and flying.

The Squirrel, designed by Darcy Whyte is the easiest to build. Free plans are available for download for a Squirrel.

The smallest rubber powered model aircraft was built in 1931 by a Philadelphia high school student, called the &quot;Flying Flea&quot; and was one and a quarter inches long and could remain airborne for approximately one minute.

== Power ==

Power models are those with an onboard power source which is not a rubber motor. Frequently this is an internal combustion engine, and the engine run is limited, typically to just five seconds. Designing an aircraft which climbs as high as possible, with minimum drag at a low lift coefficient, but then must convert to a slow flying glider, is a challenge unique in aviation. However, the category also includes compressed gas motors and electric power. The FAI power class is F1C. F1C models are equipped with an internal combustion engine of up to 2.5cc and need to weight at least 300 g per 1cc (i.e. minimum weight of a 2.5cc equipped model is 750 g). These engines are usually custom made for optimal power output and often yield at more than 30,000 RPM. Many F1C models feature folding wings, to minimize the aerodynamic drag during the climb phase.

Another type of powered free flight models is CO2 (its FAI category is F1K ). These models fly using a small engine powered by carbon dioxide. These models are very light. The amount of CO2 is limited to 2 cm3, which is enough for cca. 2 minutes of flight.

Another popular free flight Class is FAI category F1J which is similar to F1C however the engines are 1cc displacement or less. These models use engines like the Profi, and other specialized manufactured engines from Russia and Europe.

Sport free flight fliers also use small internal combustion engines, and increasingly; electric motor-powered free flight scale models.

== Indoor ==

As the name suggests, indoor models are designed to fly indoors. These models are typically very light in weight because they do not have to withstand external weather conditions.

There are a number of classes of indoor free flight models. Some are scale reproductions but others are designed purely to fly for as long as possible. These models are timed with a stopwatch.

The FAI is the international organising body for all air sports worldwide, including aeromodelling. The FAI sanctions World and European Championships for the ultimate indoor duration class designated F1D. F1D models must have a minimum weight of 1.4 grams and a maximum wing span of 55 cm. These models are constructed from light balsa sheet and strip, boron filament, carbon fibre, and a transparent covering of plastic film less than 0.5 micrometres thick. The models are powered by 0.4 grams of rubber in a single loop about 9.0 inches long that can be wound to take around 1500 turns. The average propeller RPM during a flight is less than 50 and these models fly at less than walking pace. F1D models require a large space, such as a sports hall, aircraft or dirigible hangar, with the famous atrium of the West Baden Springs Hotel having been previously used for indoor free flight competitions in the United States, and there is even a salt mine in Romania underground that has hosted the FAI world F1D championships several times. Single flight times approach forty minutes.

Although most other indoor model aircraft are also rubber-powered, gliders and aircraft powered by compressed gas or electric batteries are also flown indoors. Some classes concentrate on scale or semi-scale replicas of man-carrying aircraft. Others feature unusual flight configurations, such as ornithopters, helicopters or autogiros.

Indoor modelling is now about a century old. A history of indoor models may be found here.

== Old Timers ==

Sanctioned in the United States by the Society of Antique Modelers , and by a growing number of &quot;SAM&quot; organization chapters around the world (as well as similar national clubs in some nations) so-called &quot;Old Timer&quot; free flight model aircraft, which can be gliders, rubber powered or engine powered models, are flyable reproductions of free flight model aircraft designs that generally originated from anywhere in the world, any time before the US involvement in World War II began in 1941-42. Scaling of the size (enlargement or reduction) of these designs are permitted for most of the event types in SAM competition, with a few specialized categories existing for reproduction models that mandate the models be built in their original size only.

In the United Kingdom, models built to plans or kits published before January 1951 are categorised as vintage and those subsequently but prior to 1960 are categorised as classic. Jim Arnott holds Winding Boy, a classic rubber model designed by Urlan Wannop.

Low-pressure, enjoyable competitions for these models generally follow the modern competition formats, with special categories for these early-design models that re-create the model aircraft events actually held before WWII, and even the &quot;old-timer&quot; movement has seriously begun to embrace electric-powered versions of designs originally built for the two-stroke gasoline-fueled engines of pre-WWII free flight aeromodelling. Actual pre-WW II vintage gasoline-fueled model engines, or authentically operational reproductions of them, are even used on some of the engine-powered designs, and a substantial interest exists in so-called &quot;RC Assist&quot; old timer free flight models within the SAM organization, which takes the engine powered designs of that era, powers them with more modern two and four stroke glow engines or brushless electric motors instead, and adds rudder, elevator and engine control from a radio control transmitter, just as would be done in the regular RC hobby.

Old Timer free flight aircraft specifications, competition rules and guidelines are available from the SAM organization online. 

== Scale rubber ==

Rubber scale models replicate full-scale aircraft. Scale documentation is used at contests to check the accuracy and compliance of the model to the full-scale aircraft modeled.

Most rubber scale models are in the 20” to 30” wingspan range. Exceptions are for &quot;Peanut Scale&quot; class models, with a maximum 13” wingspan and &quot;Jumbo Scale&quot; class models, with 36” or greater wingspan. The models are powered with loops of rubber matched to the weight of the model and the diameter and pitch of the propeller. The length of the loops often exceed twice the length of the fuselage of the model. The flying duration of the scale model is greatly increased because of the number of windings that can be made on such a long loop of rubber with multiple strands. A mechanical winder is used and the rubber is stretched up to fives times original length to pack in maximum winds on the motor. In flight, these models look just like the real thing. All that is missing is the noise of the engine in the original airplane. Experts can achieve spectacular flights from obscure designs such as the Wright brothers original and Bleriot&#x27;s channel crosser, to one-of-a-kind Depression era homebuilts and modern day experimental aircraft.

<text>Primary Colors: A Novel of Politics is a 1996 book by columnist Joe Klein, published anonymously, about the presidential campaign of a southern governor. It is a &quot;roman à clef&quot; (a work of fiction based on real people and events) about Bill Clinton&#x27;s first presidential campaign in 1992. It was adapted as a film of the same name in 1998.

The book has been compared to two other novels about American politics: Robert Penn Warren&#x27;s &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (1946) and &quot;&quot; (2011).

Klein was identified as the author several months after its publication. He wrote a sequel, &quot;The Running Mate&quot; in 2000, focusing on &quot;Primary Colors&quot; character Charlie Martin.

==Plot summary==
The book begins as an idealistic former congressional worker, Henry Burton, joins the presidential campaign of Southern governor Jack Stanton, a thinly disguised stand-in for Bill Clinton. The plot then follows the primary election calendar beginning in New Hampshire where Stanton&#x27;s affair with Cashmere, his wife&#x27;s hairdresser, and his participation in a Vietnam War era protest come to light and threaten to derail his presidential prospects. In Florida, Stanton revives his campaign by disingenuously portraying his Democratic opponent as insufficiently pro-Israel and as a weak supporter of Social Security. Burton becomes increasingly disillusioned with Stanton, who is a policy wonk who talks too long, eats too much and is overly flirtatious toward women. Stanton is also revealed to be insincere in his beliefs, saying whatever will help him to win. Matters finally come to a head, and Burton is forced to choose between idealism and realism.

== Identity of the author ==
Klein maintained his anonymity throughout the publication process. Random House&#x27;s Daniel Menaker, who edited the book and came up with its title, acted as an early liaison to the press while remaining unaware of the author&#x27;s identity. An early reviewer opined that the author wished to remain unknown because &quot;Anonymity makes truthfulness much easier&quot;. Later commentators called the publishing of the book under an anonymous identity an effective marketing strategy that produced more publicity for the book, and thus more sales, without calling into question the author&#x27;s actual inside knowledge.
Several people, including former Clinton speechwriter David Kusnet, believed the style of writing had similarities to that of Klein. This was also supported by a quantitative stylometric analysis of the book by Vassar professor Donald Foster. Klein initially denied writing the book and publicly condemned Foster. Klein denied authorship again in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, speculating that another writer wrote it. &quot;Washington Post&quot; Style editor David Von Drehle, in an interview, asked Klein if he was willing to stake his journalistic credibility on his denial, to which Klein agreed.

In July 1996, after &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published the results of a handwriting analysis of notes made on an early manuscript of the book, Klein finally admitted that he was the author.

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Daily News&quot; described the book as a farce and praised it as funny, truthful, and as containing &quot;uncannily accurate&quot; portraits of its thinly disguised characters.

The book was #1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for fiction, for nine weeks in 1996.

==Fictional characters and believed real-life inspirations==

<doc id="242556" wikidata="Q7096453" url="?curid=242556" title="Open theism">
<text>Open theism, also known as openness theology, is a theological movement that has developed within Christianity as a rejection of the synthesis of Greek philosophy and Christian theology. It is a version of free will theism and arises out of the free will theistic tradition of the church, which goes back to the early church fathers. Open theism is typically advanced as a biblically motivated and logically consistent theology of human and divine freedom (in the libertarian sense), with an emphasis on what this means for the content of God&#x27;s foreknowledge and exercise of God&#x27;s power.

Open theist theologian Thomas Jay Oord identifies four paths to open and relational theology:
# following the biblical witness,
# following themes in some Christian theological traditions,
# following the philosophy of free will, and
# following the path of reconciling faith and science.
Roger E. Olson said that open theism triggered the &quot;most significant controversy about the doctrine of God in evangelical thought&quot; in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

==Exposition of open theism==
In short, open theism posits that since God and humans are free, God&#x27;s knowledge is dynamic and God&#x27;s providence flexible. Whereas several versions of traditional theism picture God&#x27;s knowledge of the future as a singular, fixed trajectory, open theism sees it as a plurality of branching possibilities, with some possibilities becoming settled as time moves forward. Thus, the future, as well as God&#x27;s knowledge of it, is &quot;open&quot; (hence, &quot;open&quot; theism). Other versions of classical theism hold that God fully determines the future, entailing that there is no free choice (the &quot;future&quot; is closed). Yet other versions of classical theism hold that, though there is freedom of choice, God&#x27;s omniscience necessitates God&#x27;s foreknowing what free choices are made (God&#x27;s &quot;foreknowledge&quot; is closed). Open theists hold that these versions of classical theism do not agree with the biblical concept of God; the biblical understanding of divine and creaturely freedom; and/or result in incoherence. Open theists tend to emphasize that God&#x27;s most fundamental character trait is love and that this trait is unchangeable. They also (in contrast to traditional theism) tend to hold that the biblical portrait is of a God deeply moved by creation, experiencing a variety of feelings in response to it.

===Comparison of open and Reformed theism===

The following chart compares beliefs about key doctrines as stated by open theists and Calvinists after &quot;the period of controversy&quot; between adherents of the two theisms began in 1994. During this period the &quot;theology of open theism… rocked the evangelical world&quot;.
==Historical development==
Contemporary open theists have named precursors among philosophers to document their assertion that &quot;the open view of the future is not a recent concept,&quot; but has a long history.

The first known post-biblical Christian writings advocating concepts similar to open theism with regard to the issue of foreknowledge are found in the writings of Calcidius, a 4th-century interpreter of Plato. It was affirmed in the 16th century by Socinus, and in the early 18th century by Samuel Fancourt and by Andrew Ramsay (an important figure in Methodism). In the 19th century several theologians wrote in defense of this idea, including Isaak August Dorner, Gustav Fechner, Otto Pfleiderer, Jules Lequier, Adam Clarke, Billy Hibbard, Joel Hayes, T.W. Brents, and Lorenzo D. McCabe. Contributions to this defense increased as the century drew to a close.

The dynamic omniscience view has been affirmed by a number of non Christians as well: Cicero (1st century BC) Alexander of Aphrodisias (2nd century) and Porphyry (3rd century). God&#x27;s statement to Abraham “Now I know that you fear me” (Gen 22:12) was much discussed by Medieval Jewish theologians. Two significant Jewish thinkers who affirmed dynamic omniscience as the proper interpretation of the passage were Ibn Ezra (12th century) and Gersonides (14th century).

Sergei Bulgakov, an early-20th-century Russian Orthodox priest and theologian advocated the use of the term panentheism, which articulated a necessary link between God and creation as consequence of God&#x27;s free love and not as a natural necessity. His sophiology has sometimes been seen as a precursor to &#x27;open theism&#x27;.

David R. Larson claimed in 2007 that &quot;in less detailed forms the basics of &#x27;Open Theism&#x27; have been taught at Loma Linda University for about fifty years, beginning at least as early as long-time professor Jack W. Provonsha.&quot; Provonsha started teaching at Loma Linda about 1960.

Millard Erickson belittles such precursors to open theism as &quot;virtually unknown or unnoticed.&quot;

===After 1980===
The term &quot;open theism&quot; was introduced in 1980 with theologian Richard Rice&#x27;s book &quot;The Openness of God: The Relationship of Divine Foreknowledge and Human Free Will&quot;. The broader articulation of open theism was given in 1994, when five essays were published by evangelical scholars (including Rice) under the title &quot;The Openness of God&quot;. Recent theologians of note expressing this view include: Clark Pinnock (deceased as of 2010), Greg Boyd, Thomas Jay Oord, John E. Sanders, Dallas Willard, Jürgen Moltmann, Richard Rice, C. Peter Wagner, John Polkinghorne, Hendrikus Berkhof, Adrio Konig, Harry Boer, Bethany Sollereder, Matt Parkins, Thomas Finger (Mennonite), W. Norris Clarke (Roman Catholic), Brian Hebblethwaite, Robert Ellis, Kenneth Archer (Pentecostal), Barry Callen (Church of God), Henry Knight III, Gordon Olson, and Winkie Pratney. A significant, growing number of philosophers of religion affirm it: Peter Van Inwagen, Richard Swinburne (Eastern Orthodox), William Hasker, David Basinger, Nicholas Wolterstorff, Dean Zimmerman, Timothy O&#x27;Connor, James D. Rissler, Keith DeRose, Richard E. Creel, Robin Collins (philosopher/theologian/physicist), J. R. Lucas, Vincent Brümmer, (Roman Catholic), Richard Purtill, Alan Rhoda, Jeffrey Koperski, Dale Tuggy, and Keith Ward. Biblical scholars Terence E. Fretheim, Karen Winslow, and John Goldingay affirm it. Others include writers Madeleine L&#x27;Engle and Paul C. Borgman, mathematician D.J. Bartholomew and biochemist/theologian Arthur Peacocke.

==Philosophical arguments==
Open theists maintain that traditional classical theists hold the classical attributes of God together in an incoherent way. The main classical attributes are as follows:
* All-good: God is the standard of moral perfection, all-benevolent, and perfectly loving.
* Simplicity: God has no parts, cannot be differentiated, and possesses no attribute as distinct from His being.
* Immutability: God cannot change in any respect.
* Impassibility: God cannot be affected by outside forces.
* Omnipresence: God is present everywhere, or more precisely, all things find their location in God.
* Omniscience: God knows absolutely everything: believes all truths and disbelieves all falsehoods. God&#x27;s knowledge is perfect.
* Omnipotence: God can do anything because he is all-powerful and not limited by external forces.

Alleged contradictions in the traditional attributes are pointed out by open theists and atheists alike. Atheist author and educator George H. Smith writes in his book &quot;&quot; that if God existed, God cannot be omnipotent because: &quot;If God knew the future with infallible certainty, he cannot change it – in which case he cannot be omnipotent. If God can change the future, however, he cannot have infallible knowledge of it&quot;.

Open theism also answers the question of how God can be blameless and omnipotent even though evil exists in the world. H. Roy Elseth gives an example of a parent that knows with certainty that his child would go out and murder someone if he was given a gun. Elseth argues that if the parent did give the gun to the child then the parent would be responsible for that crime. However, if God was unsure about the outcome then God would not be culpable for that act; only the one who committed the act would be guilty. An orthodox Christian might try, on the contrary, seek to ground a theodicy in the resurrection, both of Christ and the general resurrection to come, though this is not the traditional answer to evil.

==Varieties of open theists==
Philosopher Alan Rhoda has described several different approaches several open theists have taken with regard to the future and God&#x27;s knowledge of it.

*Voluntary Nescience: The future is alethically settled but nevertheless epistemically open for God because he has voluntarily chosen not to know truths about future contingents. It is thought Dallas Willard held this position.
*Involuntary Nescience: The future is alethically settled but nevertheless epistemically open for God because truths about future contingents are in principle unknowable. William Hasker, Peter Van Inwagen, and Richard Swinburne espouse this position.
*Non-Bivalentist Omniscience: The future is alethically open and therefore epistemically open for God because propositions about future contingents are neither true nor false. J. R. Lucas and Dale Tuggy espouse this position.
*Bivalentist Omniscience: The future is alethically open and therefore epistemically open for God because propositions asserting of future contingents that they &#x27;will&#x27; obtain or that they &#x27;will not&#x27; obtain are both false. Instead, what is true is that they &#x27;might and might not&#x27; obtain. Greg Boyd holds this position.&quot;

==Criticism==
Norman Geisler, a critic of open theism, addresses the claims that the Classical attributes were derived from the Greeks with three observations:
# The quest for something unchanging is not bad.
# The Greeks did not have the same concept of God.
# Philosophical influences are not wrong in themselves.

An open theist might respond that all such criticisms are misplaced. As to observation (1), it is not characteristic of open theists to say that the quest for something unchanging is bad. Indeed, open theists believe God&#x27;s character is unchanging. As to observation (2), open theists do not characteristically say traditional forms of classical theism have exactly the same concept of God as the Greeks. Rather, they argue that they imported only some unbiblical assumptions from the Greeks. They also point to theologians of the Christian tradition who, throughout history, did not succumb so strongly to Hellenistic influences. As to observation (3), open theists do not argue that philosophical influences are bad in themselves. Rather, they argue that some philosophical influences on Christian theology are unbiblical and theologically groundless. Consider John Sanders&#x27; statement in &quot;The Openness of God&quot; (1980):

Opponents of open theism, both Arminians, and Calvinists, such as John Piper, claim that the verses commonly used by open theists are anthropopathisms. They suggest that when God seems to change from action A to action B in response to prayer, action B was the inevitable event all along, and God divinely ordained human prayer as the means by which God actualized that course of events.

They also point to verses that suggest God is immutable, such as:
* : For I, the Lord, have not changed; and you, the sons of Jacob, have not reached the end.
* : God is not a man that He should lie, nor is He a mortal that He should repent. Would He say and not do, speak and not fulfill?
* : And also, the Strength of Israel will neither lie nor repent, for He is not a man to repent.&quot;
* : [I] tell the end from the beginning, and from before, what was not done; [I] say, &quot;My counsel shall stand, and all My desire I will do.&quot;

Those advocating the traditional view see these as the verses that form God&#x27;s character, and they interpret other verses that say God repents as anthropomorphistic. Authors who claim this can be traced back through Calvin, Luther, Aquinas, Ambrose, and Augustine. Open theists note that there seems to be an arbitrary distinction here between those verses which are merely anthropopathic and others which form God&#x27;s character. They also note that the immediate sense of the passages addressing God&#x27;s inalterability ought to be understood in the Hebrew sense of his faithfulness and justice. In other words, God&#x27;s love and character is unchanging; this, however, demands that His approach to people (especially in the context of personal relationship) be flexible.

===Literary debate===
In the early 18th century, an extended public correspondence flourished around the topic of open theism. The debate was incited by Samuel Fancourt&#x27;s 1727 publication, &quot;The Greatness of Divine Love Vindicated&quot;. Over the next decade, four other English writers published polemical works in response. This led Fancourt to defend his views in six other publications. In his 1747 autobiography, in response to some who thought that this controversy had affected his career, Fancourt wrote, &quot;Should it be suggested, that my religious principles were a prejudice unto me—I answer: so are those of every Dissenting Protestant in the [United] Kingdom with some, if he dares to think and to speak what he thinks.&quot; Fancourt also names other writers who had supported his views.

In 2005, a &quot;raging debate&quot; among evangelicals about &quot;open or free-will theism&quot; was in place. This period of controversy began in 1994 with the publication of &quot;The Openness of God&quot;. The debate between open and classical theists is illustrated by their books as in the following chart.

<doc id="242561" wikidata="Q3274349" url="?curid=242561" title="Griddle">
<text>A griddle, in the UK also called a girdle, is a cooking device consisting mainly of a broad, usually flat cooking surface. Nowadays it can be either a movable metal pan- or plate-like utensil, a flat heated cooking surface built onto a stove as a kitchen range, or a compact cooking machine with its own heating system attached to an integrated griddle acting as a cooktop.

A traditional griddle can either be a brick slab or tablet, or a flat or curved metal disc, while in industrialized countries, a griddle is most commonly a flat metal plate. A griddle can have both residential and commercial applications and can be heated directly or indirectly. The heating can be supplied either by a flame fuelled by wood, coal or gas; or by electrical elements. Commercial griddles run on electricity, natural gas or propane.

Griddles can be made of cast iron, but there are also non-stick varieties. A residential griddle may be made of cast iron, aluminium, chrome steel, or carbon steel. The vast majority of commercial-grade griddles are made from A36 steel, though some are stainless steel or composites of stainless and aluminium. The plate surfaces of commercial griddles can be made of cast iron, polished steel, cold-rolled steel or can have a chrome finish.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;griddle&quot; is attested in 13th-century English and probably comes from Anglo-French &quot;gridil&quot;, which had developed over time from the Latin word &quot;craticula&quot;, &#x27;small griddle&#x27; (&quot;craticula&quot; – &quot;graille&quot; – &quot;gredil&quot; – &quot;gridil&quot;), possibly via the Latin &quot;craticulum&quot;, &#x27;fine wickerwork&#x27;.

In British English it is also called girdle.

==Traditional and early modern==

Traditional griddles include a stone or brick slab or tablet, and a shallow platter filled with sand. The former are usually heated to cooking temperature before the food is placed on them, the latter heated after. Later versions were sometimes integrated into the tops of wood-fired stoves as a removable iron plate, and later as a separate, typically handle-less plate covering one or more burners on a gas or electric stove.

===Middle East===
In traditional Middle Eastern and South Asian cuisines, a &quot;saj&quot; is a convex griddle that is used to cook a variety of flatbread types.

===Latin America===
In Latin America, one traditional style of griddle is a &quot;budare&quot;. Made from stone or clay, it is used to cook a variety of flatbreads, such as tortilla, arepa and casabe. Modern versions for commercial use are metal and called comals.

===Great Britain===
In Britain, the griddle is also called girdle and is used for instance for making scones. It can take the shape of a thick iron plate, round and held from above by a half-hoop handle.

The traditional Scottish &quot;girdle&quot; has a flat wrought iron disk with an upturned rim to which a semicircular hoop handle is attached, allowing it to be suspended over the fire from a central chain and hook. Girdles are used for cooking scones, bannocks, pancakes and oatcakes.

The traditional Welsh bakestone is similar, circular with a one-piece handle, typically cast iron, in thickness. It is used to cook Welsh cakes, pikelets, and crepes.

===United States===
In Upstate New York, a griddle used to be the lid covering a round opening on the cooking surface of a wood- or coal-burning stove.

==Commercial griddles==
===Dishes===
Griddles are often used to prepare breakfast items such as pancakes, French toast, eggs and bacon, as well as stir-fries and meat dishes like hamburgers, steak and chicken breasts.

===Technical details===
Commercial griddles can be 2–6 feet wide and 18–30 inches deep, and their plates can be flat or grooved. The burners on the griddle units can be controlled manually or with the help of a thermostat.

<doc id="242568" wikidata="Q3310681" url="?curid=242568" title="Personalized marketing">
<text>Personalized marketing, also known as one-to-one marketing or individual marketing, is a marketing strategy by which companies use data analysis and digital technology to show adverts to individuals based on their perceived characteristics and interests. Marketers use methods from data collection, analytics, digital electronics, and digital economics then use technology to analyze it and show personalized ads based on algorithms that attempt to deduce people’s interests.

== Technology ==
Personalized marketing is dependent on many different types of technology for data collection, data classification, data analysis, data transfer, and data scalability. Technology enables marketing professionals to collect first-party data such as gender, age group, location, and income, as well as connect them with third-party data such as click-through rates of online banner ads and social media participation.

Data Management Platforms: A data management platform (DMP) is a centralized computing system for collecting, integrating and managing large sets of structured and unstructured data from disparate sources. Personalized marketing enabled by DMPs, is sold to advertisers with the goal of having consumers receive relevant, timely, engaging, and personalized messaging and advertisements that resonate with their unique needs and wants. Growing number of DMP software options are available including Adobe Systems Audience Manager and Core Audience (Marketing Cloud) to Oracle-acquired BlueKai, Sitecore Experience Platform and X+1
Customer Relationship Management Platforms: Customer relationship management (CRM) is used by companies to manage and analyze customer interactions and data throughout the customer lifecycle, improving relationships, boosting retention, and driving sales growth. CRM systems are designed to compile information on customers across different channels (points of contact between the customer and the company) which could include the company&#x27;s website, live support, direct mail, marketing materials and social media. CRM systems can also give customer-facing staff detailed information on customers&#x27; personal information, purchase history, buying preferences and concerns. Most popular enterprise CRM applications are Salesforce.com, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, NetSuite, Hubspot, and Oracle Eloqua.

Beacon Technology: Beacon technology works on Bluetooth low energy (BLE) which is used by a low frequency chip that is found in devices like mobile phones. These chips communicate with multiple Beacon devices to form a network and are used by marketers to better personalize the messaging and mobile ads based on the customer&#x27;s proximity to their retail outlet. Beacon technology circumference has shrunk, ultimately facilitating its use. 

== Strategies ==
One-to-one marketing refers to marketing strategies applied directly to a specific consumer. Having knowledge of the consumer&#x27;s preferences, enables suggesting specific products and promotions to each consumer. One-to-one marketing is based on four main steps in order to fulfill its goals: identify, differentiate, interact, and customize.

#Identify: The focus is on getting to know the customers of a company, to collect reliable data about their preferences and how their needs can best be satisfied. Knowing a consumer&#x27;s behaviors and habits allows a company to properly target them.
#Differentiate: Involves distinguishing the customers in terms of their lifetime value to the company, knowing them by their priorities in terms of their needs, and segmenting them into more restricted groups. Ultimately, differentiating customers will help create a strategy targeted to those specific groups. 
#Interact: One needs to know by which communication channel and by what means, contact with the client is best made. It is necessary to get the customer&#x27;s attention by engaging with him/her in ways that are known as being the ones that he/she enjoys the most. It is important to maintain an ongoing conversation when interacting with consumers, regardless of the time intervals in between.
#Customize: One needs to personalize the product or service to the customer individually. The knowledge that a company has about a customer, needs to be put into practice and the information held has to be taken into account in order to be able to give the client exactly what he/she wants.

== Goals ==
The goal of personalized marketing includes improving the customer experience by delivering customized interactions and offers, ultimately leading to increased customer loyalty. By understanding individualized consumer needs, a brand can create personalized ads and products that effectively target their desired consumers, fostering satisfaction. Personalized marketing aims to create consumer satisfaction, driving brand loyalty and repeat business.

== Costs and Benefits ==
Personalized marketing is used by businesses to engage in personalized pricing which is a form of price discrimination. Personalized marketing is being adopted in one form or another by many different companies because of the benefits it brings for both the businesses and their customers. 

Described below are the costs and benefits of personalized marketing for businesses and customers: 

===Businesses===
Prior to the Internet, businesses faced challenges in measuring the success of their marketing campaigns. A campaign would be launched, and even if there was a change in revenue, it was often challenging to determine what impact the campaign had on the change. Personalized marketing allows businesses to learn more about customers based on demographic, contextual, and behavioral data. This behavioral data, as well as being able to track consumers’ habits, allows firms to better determine what advertising campaigns and marketing efforts are bringing customers in and what demographics they are influencing. This allows firms to drop efforts that are ineffective, as well as put more money into the techniques that are bringing in customers.

Some personalized marketing can also be automated, increasing the efficiency of a business&#x27;s marketing strategy. For example, an automated email could be sent to a user shortly after an order is placed, giving suggestions for similar items or accessories that may help the customer better use the product he or she ordered, or a mobile app could send a notification about relevant deals to a customer when he or she is close to a store.

===Customers===
Consumers are presented with a wide range of products and services to choose from. A single retail website may offer a large variety of products, and few have the time inclination to browse through everything retailers have to offer. At the same time, customers expect ease and convenience in their shopping experience. In a recent survey, 74% of consumers said they get frustrated when websites have content, offers, ads, and promotions that have nothing to do with them. Many even expressed that they would leave a site if the marketing on the site was the opposite of their tastes, such as prompts to donate to a political party they dislike, or ads for a dating service when the visitor to the site is married. In addition, the top two reasons customers unsubscribe from marketing emailing lists are 1) they receive too many emails and 2) the content of the emails is not relevant to them.

Personalized marketing helps to bridge the gap between the vastness of what is available and the needs of customers for streamlined shopping experience. By providing a customized experience for customers, frustrations of purchase choices may be avoided. Customers may be able to find what they are looking for more efficiently, reducing the time spent searching through unrelated content and products. Consumers have become accustomed to this type of user experience that caters to their interests, and companies that have created ultra-customized digital experiences, such as Amazon and Netflix.

== Future of Personalized Marketing ==
Personalized marketing is gaining headway and has become a point of popular interest with the emergence of relevant and supportive technologies like Data Management Platform, geotargeting, and various forms of social media. Now, it is believed to be an inevitable baseline for the future of marketing strategy and for future business success in competitive markets.

Adapt to technology: Companies must adapt to relevant technologies in order for personalized marketing to be implemented. They may need to familiarize themselves with forms of social media, data-gathering platforms, and other technologies. Companies have access to machine learning, big data and AI that automate personalization processes.

Restructuring current business models: Time and resources are necessary to adopt new marketing systems tailored to the most relevant technologies. Organized planning, communication and restructuring within businesses are essential to successfully implement personalized marketing. Personalized marketing prompts businesses to consider customer data and relevant outside information. Company databases are filled with expansive personal information, such as individuals&#x27; geographic locations and potential buyers’ past purchases, which raises concerns about how that information is gathered, circulated internally and externally, and used to increase profits.

Legal liabilities: To address concerns about sensitive information being gathered and utilized without obvious consumer consent, liabilities and legalities have to be set and enforced. To prevent any privacy issues, companies manage legal hurdles before personalized marketing is adopted. Specifically, the EU has passed rigid regulation, known as GDPR, that limits what kind of data marketers can collect on their users, and provide ways in which consumers can suit companies for violation of their privacy. In the US, California has followed suit and passed the CCPA in 2018.

== Controversies ==
===Use of algorithms===
Algorithms generate data by analyzing and associating it with user preferences, such as browsing history and personal profiles. Rather than discovering new facts or perspectives, one will be presented with similar or adjoining concepts (&quot;filter bubble&quot;). Some consider this exploitation of existing ideas rather than discovery of new ones. Presenting someone with only personalized content may also exclude other, unrelated news or information that might in fact be useful to the user.

Algorithms may also be flawed. In February 2015, Coca-Cola ran into trouble over an automated, algorithm-generated bot created for advertising purposes. Gawker’s editorial labs director, Adam Pash, created a Twitter bot @MeinCoke and set it up to tweet lines from &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and then link to them with Coca-Cola’s campaign #MakeItHappy. This resulted in Coca-Cola’s Twitter feed broadcasting big chunks of Adolf Hitler’s text. In November 2014, the New England Patriots were forced to apologize after an automatic, algorithm-generated bot was tricked into tweeting a racial slur from the official team account.

== Internet marketing ==
Personalized marketing has proven most effective in interactive media, particularly on the internet. A website has the ability to track a customer&#x27;s interests and make suggestions based on the collected data. Many sites help customers make choices by organizing information and prioritizing it based on the individual&#x27;s liking. In some cases, the product itself can be customized using a configuration system. 

The business movement during Web 1.0 leveraged database technology for targeting products, ads, and services to specific users with particular profile attributes. The concept was supported by technologies such as BroadVision, ATG, and BEA. Amazon is a classic example of a company that performs &quot;One to One Marketing&quot; by offering users targeted offers and related products. 

== Other marketing ==
The term &quot;one-to-one marketing&quot; refers to personalized marketing behavior towards an individual based on received data. Due to its nature, &quot;one-to-one marketing&quot; is often referred to as relationship marketing. This type of marketing creates a personalized relationships with individual consumers. 

== Difficulties ==
McKinsey identified 4 problems that prevent companies from implementing large scale personalizations:

* Companies collect and store data but often fail to synchronize and analyze the correct data at the right time.
* Marketers are looking for external motives for personalization, such as holidays, while personalized marketing works best when it is based on triggers - i.e. customers&#x27; own behavior.
* Personalized marketing works best in agile companies where there&#x27;s cross-department collaboration. Most companies are used to hierarchal, strict structures that prevents data sharing across companies.
* Using inadequate technology results in the implementation of ineffective solutions.

<doc id="242570" wikidata="Q77688" url="?curid=242570" title="Ruth Westheimer">
<text>Karola Ruth Westheimer (née Siegel; June 4, 1928 – July 12, 2024), better known as Dr. Ruth, was a German and American sex therapist and talk show host.

Westheimer was born in Germany to a Jewish family. As the Nazis came to power, her parents sent the 10-year-old girl to a school in Switzerland for safety while they remained behind because of her elderly grandmother. Both were killed in concentration camps. After World War II, she emigrated to British-controlled Mandatory Palestine. At tall and 17 years of age, she joined the Haganah, and was trained as a sniper. On her 20th birthday, she was wounded in action by an exploding shell during mortar fire on Jerusalem during the 1947–1949 Palestine War, and almost lost both feet.

Two years later, Westheimer moved to Paris, France, where she studied psychology at the Sorbonne. Immigrating to the United States in 1956, she worked as a maid to put herself through graduate school, earned a Master of Arts in sociology from The New School in 1959, and earned a doctorate at age 42 from Teachers College, Columbia University, in 1970. Over the next decade, she taught at a number of universities and had a private sex therapy practice.

Westheimer&#x27;s media career began in 1980 with the radio call-in show &quot;Sexually Speaking&quot;, which continued until 1990. In 1983 it was the top-rated radio show in the country&#x27;s largest radio market. She then launched a television show, &quot;The Dr. Ruth Show&quot;, which by 1985 attracted two million viewers a week. She became known for giving serious advice while being candid, but also warm, cheerful, funny, and respectful, and for her tag phrase: &quot;Get some&quot;. In 1984 &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that she had risen &quot;from obscurity to almost instant stardom.&quot; She hosted several series on the Lifetime Channel and other cable television networks from 1984 to 1993. She became a household name and major cultural figure, appeared on several network TV shows, co-starred in a movie with Gérard Depardieu, appeared on the cover of &quot;People&quot;, sang on a Tom Chapin album, appeared in several commercials, and hosted &quot;Playboy&quot; videos. She was the author of 45 books on sex and sexuality.

The one-woman 2013 play &quot;Becoming Dr. Ruth&quot;, written by Mark St. Germain, is about Westheimer&#x27;s life, as is the 2019 documentary, &quot;Ask Dr. Ruth&quot;, directed by Ryan White. She was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame, and awarded the Magnus Hirschfeld Medal, the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, the Leo Baeck Medal, the Planned Parenthood Margaret Sanger Award, and the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.

== Early life and education ==
===Germany===
Westheimer was born Karola Ruth Siegel, on June 4, 1928, in the small village of Wiesenfeld (now part of Karlstadt am Main), in Germany. She was the only child of Orthodox Jews, Irma (née Hanauer), a housekeeper, and Julius Siegel, a notions wholesaler and son of the family for whom Irma worked. From the age of one, she lived in an apartment in Frankfurt with her parents and her paternal grandmother, Selma, who was a widow. She was given an early grounding in Judaism by her father, who took her regularly to the synagogue in the Nordend district of Frankfurt, where they lived.

Her father, 38 years old at the time, was taken away by the Nazis, who sent him to the Dachau concentration camp a week after &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, the &quot;Night of Broken Glass&quot;, when Nazis burned down 10,000 Jewish stores as well as Jewish homes and synagogues, in November 1938. She cried while her father was taken away by Gestapo men who loaded him on a truck, while her grandmother handed the Nazis money, pleading, &quot;Take good care of my son.&quot;

===Switzerland===
Westheimer&#x27;s mother and grandmother decided that Nazi Germany was too dangerous for her, due to the growing Nazi violence. Therefore, a few weeks later, in January 1939, they sent her on the &quot;Kindertransport&quot;, an organized Jewish children&#x27;s rescue train to Switzerland, though she desperately did not want to leave. Ruth, then aged 10, was never hugged again as a child.

She arrived at an orphanage of a Jewish charity in Heiden, Switzerland, as one of 300 Jewish children, some as young as six years of age. By the end of World War II, nearly all of them were orphans, as their parents never made it out of Germany and were murdered by the Nazis. In the orphanage she was given cleaning responsibilities and took on the role of a caregiver and mother-like figure to the younger children. She remained at the orphanage for six years. Girls at the orphanage were not allowed to take classes at the local school. However, a boy at the school secretly loaned her his textbooks at night so she could read them in secret and continue her education.

While at the Swiss orphanage, Westheimer corresponded with her mother and grandmother via letters. Their letters ceased in 1941, when her parents and her paternal grandmother were deported to Łódź Ghetto on 20 October 1941. There, her father and his mother died in 1942. Before learning about this later in her life, she had believed that her father was murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942. There is no information about the specific circumstances of her mother&#x27;s death. In the database at the Yad Vashem World Holocaust Remembrance Center, Westheimer&#x27;s mother is categorized as &quot;verschollen&quot;, or &quot;disappeared/murdered&quot;. In addition to Westheimer&#x27;s parents, all of her other relatives lost their lives during the Holocaust.

For many years, she lived with an &quot;irrational guilt&quot;; she thought that if she had stayed in Germany, she could have saved her parents. Later, she said the guilt had been replaced by an admiration for her parents&#x27; sacrifice in sending her to safety, saying: &quot;I would not have the courage to send my own children away like that.&quot;

===Israel===
After World War II ended, Westheimer decided to immigrate to British-controlled Mandatory Palestine at 16 years of age. After she immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in September 1945, at the age of 17, she joined Kibbutz Ramat David and worked in agriculture. Told her name was too German, she changed her name from Karola to her middle name, Ruth and went by Ruth K. Siegel, retaining Karola as her middle initial in case her parents came looking for her. She &quot;first had sexual intercourse on a starry night, in a haystack, without contraception.&quot; She later told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;I am not happy about that, but I know much better now and so does everyone who listens to my radio program.&quot; Next, she lived on Moshav Nahalal, and then, she lived on Kibbutz Yagur. She then moved to Jerusalem in 1948 to study early childhood education.


Westheimer joined the Haganah Jewish Zionist underground paramilitary organization (later, the Israel Defense Forces) in Jerusalem. Because of her diminutive height of , she was trained as a scout and sniper. Of this experience, she said, &quot;I never killed anybody, but I know how to throw hand grenades and shoot.&quot; She became an ace sniper, and learned to assemble a rifle in the dark. When she was 90 years old, she demonstrated that she was still able to put together a Sten gun with her eyes closed.

In 1948, on her 20th birthday, Westheimer was seriously wounded in action by an exploding shell during a mortar fire attack on Jerusalem during the 1947–1949 Palestine war; the explosion killed two girls who were right next to her. Temporarily paralyzed and with two injured feet (one missing a top portion), she spent months in a recuperative ward before walking again. In 2018 she said that she still visited Israel every year, and felt that it was her real home, and the following year said that she was and is a Zionist.

===France===
In 1950, at the age of 22, Westheimer married and moved to France with her first husband, David Bar-Haim, an Israeli soldier who had been accepted to medical school in Paris. There, she studied psychology under psychologist Jean Piaget at the University of Paris (the Sorbonne), and earned an undergraduate degree despite not having had a high school education and supported herself by teaching kindergarten. She then taught psychology at the Sorbonne. Her first marriage ended as Bar-Heim eventually gave up his studies and decided to return to Israel while Westheimer remained in Paris to continue her studies. They divorced in 1955.

===United States===
In 1956, using a 5,000 German marks restitution cheque paid by the German government to children whose education was disrupted by the Holocaust, she immigrated to the United States with her French boyfriend, Dan Bommer, settling in Washington Heights, Manhattan. They married and had a daughter, Miriam, but soon divorced. She worked as a maid, initially for 75 cents an hour and later for one dollar an hour (equal to $ today) to put herself through graduate school.

Westheimer earned an M.A. degree in sociology from The New School in 1959, with the help of a scholarship. She was a single mother, and an organization named Jewish Family Service paid for her then-three-year-old daughter to stay with a foster family during the day and go to a German Jewish Orthodox nursery school while Westheimer worked and went to classes at The New School. In 1970, at 42 years old, she received a Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) degree in Family-Life Studies from Teachers College, Columbia University with the help of a scholarship, studying under Shirley Zussman. She then trained as a sex therapist at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center/Cornell Medical School, working for seven years under sex therapist Helen Singer Kaplan, two years training under her and five years training others.

In 1965, Westheimer became a naturalized U.S. citizen. In 1961, she married for the third time She regained her German citizenship in 2007 through the German Citizenship Project that enabled descendants of Germans deprived of their citizenship during Nazi rule to reclaim their citizenship without losing the citizenship of their home country.

== Early career ==

After receiving her doctorate, Westheimer briefly worked for Planned Parenthood in Harlem training women to teach sex education, and this experience encouraged her to continue studying human sexuality. She went on to work as a postdoctoral researcher at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. She continued to work there as an adjunct associate professor for five years. She also taught at Lehman College, Brooklyn College, Hunter College, Adelphi University, Columbia University, Yale University, Princeton University, New York University, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center/Weill Cornell Medicine, and West Point. She treated sex therapy patients in a private practice, on East 73rd Street on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

== Media career ==
Described as &quot;Grandma Freud&quot; and the &quot;Sister Wendy of Sexuality&quot;, Westheimer helped revolutionize talk about sex and sexuality on radio and television, advocating for speaking openly about sexual issues. She fielded questions ranging from women who did not have orgasms, to the best time of day to have sex (the morning), to men with premature ejaculations, to foreplay, to oral sex, to sexual fantasies (&quot;embrace them&quot;; &quot;If you want to believe that a whole football team is in bed with you, that&#x27;s fine&quot;), to masturbation, to erections, to sexual positions, to the G-spot. She stressed that: &quot;anything that two consenting adults do in the privacy of their bedroom or kitchen floor is all right with me&quot;. Asked a question as to having sex with an animal, she responded: &quot;I&#x27;m not a veterinarian.&quot; She spoke out against engaging in any sexual activity under pressure, and against pedophilia. She educated her listeners about sexually transmitted diseases, and spoke out strongly in favor of having sex, in favor of contraception being used, in favor of the availability of abortion as an aid for contraception failures, in favor of sex within relationships rather than one-night stands, in favor of funding for Planned Parenthood, and in favor of research on AIDS. She became known for giving serious advice while being candid and funny, but warm, cheerful, and respectful; and for her tag phrase: &quot;Get some.&quot; Journalist Joyce Wadler described her as a &quot;world class charmer&quot;.

One journalist described her voice as &quot;a cross between Henry Kissinger and Minnie Mouse&quot;. She was noted for having &quot;an accent only a psychologist could love&quot;, one that was &quot;dripping chicken soup.&quot;

In 1984 &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that on radio the 55-year-old had risen &quot;from obscurity to almost instant stardom.&quot; Journalist Jeannette Catsoulis wrote later in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to explain how revolutionary her humor, candor and sexual explicitness seemed for the time.&quot;

===1980–1989===
Westheimer&#x27;s media career began in 1980 when she was 52 years old, and her radio show, &quot;Sexually Speaking&quot;, debuted on WYNY-FM in New York City. In it, she answered questions called in by listeners, and the show became nationally syndicated. She was offered the opportunity after she gave a lecture to New York broadcasters about the need for sex education programming to help deal with issues of contraception and unwanted pregnancies. Betty Elam, the community affairs manager at WYNY, was impressed with her talk and offered Westheimer $25 per week to make &quot;Sexually Speaking&quot;, which started as a 15-minute show airing every Sunday at midnight, which was historically a dead time.

By 1981, as the show attracted 250,000 listeners every week despite the network not doing any promotion for it—growing simply by word of mouth—it was extended to be one hour long on Sunday nights, starting at 10 pm. It was soon picked up by 90 stations across the United States, and it ran for a decade. The show broke taboos of the time against speaking publicly and explicitly about sex. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as one of the station&#x27;s &quot;oddest shows&quot;, and among its biggest draws. A New York University professor of human sexuality made listening to her show a class assignment. When the station offered a &quot;Dr. Ruth T-shirt&quot; (&quot;Sex on Sunday? You Bet!&quot;), it received 3,500 orders.

By 1982, her show was WYNY&#x27;s top-rated phone-in talk show. Singer Pattie Brooks recorded a song as an ode to her, &quot;Dr. Ruth,&quot; with a trendy, dance-rock tinged, high pressure beat.

By 1983 her show was the top-rated radio show in the country&#x27;s largest radio market. In 1984 NBC Radio began syndicating the radio program nationwide—it was now heard in 93 markets. She went on to produce her radio show until 1990.

In 1984, Westheimer began hosting several television programs on the Lifetime TV network, and one in syndication. Her first show was &quot;Good Sex! With Dr. Ruth Westheimer&quot;, airing for a half hour at 10 pm on weeknights. She ended each show by reminding her audience: &quot;Have good sex!&quot;

The show was expanded in 1985 to a full hour, and its name was changed to &quot;The Dr. Ruth Show&quot;. During each of her live shows, 3,000 callers tried to get through, and the show attracted an average of 450,000 viewers a night, double the audience previously watching at that hour, and attracted more viewers than any other show on Lifetime; that number rose to two million homes a week. In April 1985 she appeared on the cover of &quot;People&quot;. That year she also appeared as an actress in the French romantic comedy film &quot;Une Femme ou Deux&quot; (&quot;One Woman or Two&quot;), starring Gérard Depardieu and Sigourney Weaver, playing the part of a wealthy philanthropist.

&quot;Dr. Ruth&#x27;s Game of Good Sex&quot; was released in 1985. A Baltimore distributor said: &quot;I&#x27;m going to have to compare this to &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;. The orders overshadow anything we&#x27;ve had in our company&#x27;s 100-year history.&quot; &quot;Dr. Ruth&#x27;s Computer Game of Good Sex&quot; was a hit, released in 1986 for the Commodore 64, MS-DOS, and Apple II.
In 1987, she began a separate half-hour syndicated series on many broadcast stations called &quot;Ask Dr. Ruth&quot;, which was co-hosted by Larry Angelo. Westheimer&#x27;s friend Eleanor Bergstein, the writer of the 1987 romantic drama dance film &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, attempted to cast her to play Mrs. Schumacher in the film (with Joel Grey as her husband). She backed out when she learned the character is a thief.

She appeared on a &quot;TV Guide&quot; cover in 1988. Dr. Ruth returned to the Lifetime network in 1988 with &quot;The All New Dr. Ruth Show&quot;. That was followed in 1989 by two teen advice shows called &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Dr. Ruth?&quot;, and a call-in show, &quot;You&#x27;re on the Air with Dr. Ruth&quot; in 1990. That year she also appeared in an episode of the television series &quot;Tall Tales &amp; Legends&quot; as the &quot;Mysterious Stranger.&quot;

During the 1980s, &quot;Dr. Ruth&quot; became a household name and a major cultural figure; during the 1980s and 1990s, she made frequent guest appearances on several network television shows, including &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, and appeared on talk shows on German television. She was portrayed on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; by Mary Gross in &quot;Saturday Night News&quot; four times in 1983, and twice in 1984; was a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; twice in 1982, once in 1983, three times in 1984, twice in 1985 – in addition to being impersonated in a &quot;Mighty Carson Art Players&quot; sketch, and once in 1986; on &quot;Joan Rivers: Can We Talk?&quot; twice in 1986; seven times as a panelist on the game show &quot;The New Hollywood Squares&quot; in 1986–87; on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; once in 1989; on &quot;The Joan Rivers Show&quot; once in 1989; and on &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot; in both 1989 and 1990. In 1987, she made a TV commercial for Signal mouthwash.

===1990–1999===
In 1990, Westheimer starred in an ABC sitcom pilot, &quot;Dr. Ruth&#x27;s House&quot;, which aired as a one-time special in June of that year. ABC did not move forward in turning the pilot into a series.

In 1993, Westheimer and Israeli TV host Arad Nir hosted a talk show in Hebrew titled &quot;Min Tochnit&quot;, on the newly opened Israeli Channel 2. The show was similar to her U.S. &quot;Sexually Speaking&quot; show. The name of the show, &quot;Min Tochnit&quot;, is a play on words: literally &quot;Kind of a program&quot;, but &quot;Min&quot; (מין) in Hebrew also means &quot;sex&quot; and &quot;gender&quot;. 1993 and 1994 saw the publication of &quot;Dr. Ruth&#x27;s Good Sex Night-to-Night Calendar.&quot;

In 1994, she appeared in a computer game, an interactive CD-ROM adaptation of &quot;Dr. Ruth&#x27;s Encyclopedia of Sex&quot; released for Windows and a Philips CD-i.

In 1995, she hosted a series of &quot;Playboy&quot; instructional videos entitled &quot;Making Love&quot;. She also wrote a column distributed both nationally and internationally by the King Features Syndicate. In 1996, she co-authored &quot;Heavenly Sex&quot;, on Judaism and sex, in which she wrote: &quot;The great rabbi Simeon ben-Halafta called the penis the great peacemaker of the home.&quot; She referred to the Book of Ruth as encouraging single women to initiate sex (providing the relationship leads to marriage), cited a Talmudic mandate that an unemployed man must make love to his wife every day, and mentioned the writings of a 12th-century rabbi who suggested that couples use different positions while having sex.

In 1992, she was a guest star on the television soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. She appeared as herself in &quot;Dr. Ruth&quot;, a 1993 episode of the sci-fi drama series &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;. She appeared on the BBC radio show &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 1990; on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; once in 1990, once in 1991, once in 1993, and once in 1994; on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; once in 1991; on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; once in 1994, twice in 1995, three times in 1996, and once in 1997; on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; once in 1998; and was featured in a &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; episode in 1999.

Westheimer also appeared in several commercial advertisements, including a 1990 commercial for Clairol Herbal Essences shampoo and body wash, a 1991 Pepsi commercial (along with Annette Funicello, Frankie Avalon, Bo Jackson, and Gilbert Gottfried), and a 1994 Honda Prelude ad.

===2000–2009===

In 2000, she appeared on Grammy Award winner Tom Chapin&#x27;s album &quot;This Pretty Planet&quot;, in the song &quot;Two Kinds of Seagulls&quot;, in which she and Chapin sing in a duet of various animals that reproduce sexually. &quot;It takes two to tingle&quot; says the song. That year, she also made a TV commercial for Entenmann&#x27;s Raspberry Danish Twist.

Between 2001 and 2007, Westheimer made regular appearances on the PBS children&#x27;s television series &quot;Between the Lions&quot; as &quot;Dr. Ruth Wordheimer&quot; in a spoof of her therapist role, in which she helps anxious readers and spellers overcome their fear of long words. In 2002, she received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children, for &quot;Timeless Tales and Music of Our Time&quot;. In 2003–04, she made 10 appearances as a panelist on the game show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;.

In 2004, she made a guest appearance on &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;, an NPR news panel game, and in 2007 she appeared on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;. In January 2009, the 55th anniversary issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine included Westheimer as #13 in a list of the 55 most important people in sex from the past 55 years. That year, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; named her one of &quot;12 women who changed the way we look at sex.&quot; She also appeared in the 2009 documentary &quot;Hugh Hefner: Playboy, Activist and Rebel&quot;.

===2010–2024===
In 2011, interior designer Nate Berkus hosted her on &quot;The Nate Berkus Show&quot;, after redoing the living room and dining room of her Manhattan apartment, in which she had lived for 50 years, to reduce clutter. She appeared as a guest on &quot;The Doctors&quot; in 2011 and 2012, on &quot;Joy Behar: Say Anything!&quot; in 2012, on &quot;Rachael Ray&quot; in 2013 and 2015, and on &quot;The Today Show&quot; in 2015 and 2019.

In 2018, she wrote three books. In 2019, she published her 45th book on sex and sexuality. On her 91st birthday, June 4, 2019, Westheimer appeared as a guest on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, and she visited Ellen&#x27;s show again in November 2019, taking questions from the audience, and was also a guest in November 2020. In 2019, she was a guest on &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot;, &quot;The View&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot;, and twice on &quot;Strahan, Sara and Keke&quot;. She also had over 100,000 followers on Twitter.

Speaking of the Holocaust in 2021, Westheimer said: &quot;We must keep saying to the young people, &#x27;Think of these words — never again! Never again!&#x27; All of this must never happen again.&quot;

==Speeches and ethnography==
Westheimer delivered commencement speeches at the Hebrew Union College seminary, Lehman College of the City University of New York and, in 2004, at Trinity College, where she was awarded honorary degrees. She also was the guest speaker at the Bronx High School of Science in New York in commemoration of Yom HaShoah 2008.

Westheimer was an accomplished ethnographer. Her studies in this field included the Ethiopian Jews, Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Trobriand Islanders, and the Druze, a sect originating from Shia Islam now residing in Israel, Syria, and Lebanon. The latter were the subjects of her 2007 PBS documentary &quot;The Olive and the Tree: The Secret Strength of the Druze&quot;, and a book of the same title. She was also the Executive Producer for PBS documentaries &quot;Surviving Salvation and No Missing Link&quot;, &quot;Shifting Sands: Bedouin Women at the Crossroads&quot;, and &quot;The Unknown Face of Islam&quot; (on the Circassians).

Westheimer was a board member of the Museum of Jewish Heritage in Lower Manhattan in New York City.

==Play and documentary==
In October 2013 the one-woman play &quot;Becoming Dr. Ruth&quot;, written by Mark St. Germain and directed by Julianne Boyd and set in 1997, opened Off Broadway at the Westside Theatre. Actress Debra Jo Rupp played the role of Dr. Ruth. The play showcased the sex therapist&#x27;s life from fleeing the Nazis in the Kindertransport and joining the Haganah in Jerusalem as a scout and sniper, to her struggles to succeed as a single mother coming to the United States. Eileen DeSandre played Dr. Ruth in the Virginia Repertory Theatre production of &quot;Becoming Dr. Ruth&quot;. In 2021, actress Tovah Feldshuh played Dr. Ruth.

In 2019, the documentary &quot;Ask Dr. Ruth&quot; directed by Ryan White was in theaters, and was made available on Hulu, as she approached her 90th birthday. it won a 4th Critics&#x27; Choice Documentary Award in 2019 as &quot;Most Compelling Living Subject of a Documentary,&quot; and was a 19th AARP Movies for Grownups Awards nominee in 2019 for &quot;Best Documentary.&quot; Having previously avoided discussing her early years and how the Holocaust affected her family and herself, Westheimer believed that current events made it necessary for her to &quot;stand up and be counted&quot;. She said that seeing child refugees being separated from their parents upset her, because her own story was reflected in what they were going through.

==Accolades==

Some time before 1983, Westheimer was made a non-physician Fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine.

In 2008, Westheimer&#x27;s name was added to the Bronx Walk of Fame (as the first &quot;Honorary Bronxite,&quot; chosen for contributions to the life of the borough). In 2010 she was made a member of the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame. In 2017 she was inducted into the German-American Hall of Fame. In 2019, she was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame.

Westheimer was named 1983 Jewish Woman of Achievement by a consortium of organizations connected with the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies in New York, received the 1986 Mayor&#x27;s Liberty Award from New York City Mayor Ed Koch, and was given the 1987 Motion Picture Theater Bookers Association Star of Tomorrow Award. Her show &quot;The All New Dr. Ruth Show&quot; won a 1988 Ace Award, and was awarded the 1994 Magnus Hirschfeld Medal and the 1995 American Academy of Clinical Sexology Medal of Sexology. In 2002, she received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, as well as the Leo Baeck Medal for her humanitarian work promoting tolerance and social justice, in 2006 the Columbia University Teacher&#x27;s College Medal For Distinguished Services, in 2012 the National Alliance on Mental Illness Yale Mental Health Research Advocacy Award, in 2013 the Planned Parenthood Margaret Sanger Award, and in 2019 the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany and the James Parks Morton Interfaith Award. The Library of Congress acquired her papers in 2022.

In 2000 Westheimer received an honorary doctorate from Hebrew Union College, in 2001 an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Lehman College, in 2008 an honorary doctorate from Westfield State University, in 2014 an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree from Trinity College in Connecticut, and in 2019 an honorary doctorate from Ben Gurion University of the Negev (she remarked: &quot;I wish I had met Ben Gurion. He was short.&quot;).

In 2023, Westheimer received the Women&#x27;s Entrepreneurship Day Psychology Pioneer Award from the United Nations.

== Personal life and death ==
Westheimer was married three times, the first time to Israeli soldier and medical student David Bar-Heim for five years, and the second time briefly to Dan Bommer, with whom she had her daughter, Miriam, who later took the last name of her stepfather. She said each of her marriages played an important role in her relationship advice, but after two divorces it was her third marriage, at age 32 to fellow Holocaust survivor Manfred &#x27;Fred&#x27; Westheimer, that was the &quot;real marriage&quot;. She met Fred on a ski tow in the Catskills. Fred, too, had escaped Nazi Germany. When Diane Sawyer, interviewing the couple for the TV show &quot;60 Minutes&quot; asked her husband about their sex life, he answered, &quot;The shoemaker&#x27;s children have no shoes.&quot; Their marriage lasted 36 years, until his death in 1997.

She had two children: Dr. Miriam Yael Westheimer, an educator, author, and chief program officer of HIPPY International, which develops early childhood education and literacy programs, and who lived in Israel for six years and later married Joel Henry Einleger, and Joel Westheimer, a professor at the University of Ottawa; she had four grandchildren. She said: &quot;I was so short – 4 feet 7 inches – that I couldn&#x27;t believe that anything could grow inside of me.&quot;

Westheimer spoke English, German, French, and Hebrew.

In December 2014, Westheimer was a guest at a wedding in the Bronx. The groom, Rabbi Benjamin Goldschmidt, was the great-grandson of the woman who had helped rescue Westheimer from Nazi Germany.

Among her concerns in the 21st century was loneliness of people. In 2023, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York appointed Westheimer as the inaugural &quot;Loneliness Ambassador&quot;.

In her final years, Westheimer lived in the cluttered three-bedroom apartment on 190th Street &quot;in Washington Heights where she raised her two children and became famous, in that order&quot;. She stayed there, she said in 1995, to be near the two synagogues of which she was a member (one of which is the Reform synagogue the Hebrew Tabernacle Congregation of Washington Heights, and the other of which is Conservative Synagogue Adath Israel of Riverdale; she was also a member of the Orthodox synagogue Ohav Shalom until it closed), the YMHA of Washington Heights and Inwood of which she was president for 11 years, and a &quot;still sizable community of German Jewish World War II refugees&quot;. She explained: &quot;Because of my experience with the Holocaust, I don&#x27;t like to lose friends.&quot;

Westheimer died at her home in Manhattan on July 12, 2024, at the age of 96.

<text>Mingus Mountain () is a mountain located in the U.S. state of Arizona in the Black Hills mountain range. It is located within the Prescott National Forest traversed by State Route 89A approximately midway between Cottonwood and Prescott. The summit can be reached via Forest Service roads that branch off from State Route 89A. From the mountain, there are views of the Verde Valley, Sycamore Canyon Wilderness and the towns of Cottonwood, Jerome, and Clarkdale. The Woodchute Wilderness, north of the summit of 89A, also offers views and hiking trails. There are several National Forest campgrounds in the area and it is the transmitter location for Prescott full-service television station KAZT-TV and several low-power television stations serving Cottonwood, Clarkdale, Camp Verde and Prescott Valley. Mingus Mountain is also the premier flying site of the Arizona Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association.

According to the book, &quot;Roadside History of Arizona&quot;, by Marshall Trimble, &quot;Mingus Mountain was named for Joseph and Jacob Mingus, two brothers who settled in the area in the 1880s and later operated a sawmill near the base of the mountain&quot;. Another source attributes the name to William Mingus (d. 1911, Prescott, Arizona), a pioneer prospector who lived and worked on Mingus Mountain in the 1870s.

The Mingus Lookout Complex is a complex of fire tower and associated buildings at the top of the mountain, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="242573" wikidata="Q207193" url="?curid=242573" title="Skellig Michael">
<text>Skellig Michael ( ), also called Great Skellig ( ), is a twin-pinnacled crag west of the Iveragh Peninsula in County Kerry, Ireland. The island is named after the archangel Michael, with &quot;Skellig&quot; derived from the Irish language word , meaning a splinter of stone. Its twin island, Little Skellig (), is smaller and inaccessible (landing is not permitted). The two islands rose c. 374–360 million years ago during a period of mountain formation, along with the MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks mountain range. Later, they were separated from the mainland by rising water levels.

Skellig Michael consists of approximately of rock, with its highest point, known as the Spit, above sea level. The island is defined by its twin peaks and intervening valley (known as Christ&#x27;s Saddle), which make its landscape steep and inhospitable. It is best known for its Gaelic monastery, founded between the 6th and 8th centuries, and its variety of inhabiting species, which include gannets, puffins, a colony of razorbills and a population of approximately fifty grey seals. The island is of special interest to archaeologists, as the monastic settlement is in unusually good condition. The monastery is situated at an elevation of , Christ&#x27;s Saddle at , and the flagstaff area at above sea level.

The monastery can be approached by narrow and steep flights of stone steps which ascend from three landing points. The hermitage on the south peak contains a dangerous approach and is largely closed to the public. Because of the often difficult crossing from the mainland and the exposed nature of the landing spots, the island is accessible only during summer months. UNESCO designated Skellig Michael a World Heritage Site in 1996.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;Skellig&quot; derives from the old Irish word &quot;sceillec&quot;, which translates as &quot;small or steep area of rock&quot;. The word is unusual in Irish placenames and appears only in a few other instances, including Bunskellig, County Cork, and the Temple-na-Skellig church in Glendalough, County Wicklow. It may be of Old Norse origin, from the word &quot;skellingar&quot; (&quot;the resounding ones&quot;). An early but rarely used alternative Irish name for the island is &quot;Glascarraig&quot; (&quot;the green rock&quot;).

The first known reference to the Skelligs appears in the Irish annals; a retelling of a shipwreck occurring around 1400 BC, said to have been caused by the Tuatha Dé Danann, a supernatural race in Irish mythology. According to legend, Irr, son of Míl Espáine (who is sometimes credited with the colonisation of Ireland), was travelling from the Iberian Peninsula, but drowned and was buried on the island. Daire Domhain (&quot;King of the World&quot;) is said to have stayed there c. 200 AD before attacking Fionn mac Cumhaill&#x27;s army in nearby Ventry. A text from the 8th or 9th century records that Duagh, King of West Munster, fled to &quot;Scellecc&quot; after a feud with the Kings of Cashel sometime in the 5th century, although the historicity of the event has not been established. Other early mentions include in the narrative prose of the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; and &quot;Cath Finntrágha&quot;, as well the medieval &quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot;.

==Geography==

Skellig Michael is a steep pyramidal rugged rock (or &quot;crag&quot;) of on the Atlantic coast off the Iveragh peninsula of County Kerry. It is west north-west of Bolus Head, at the southern end of Saint Finian&#x27;s Bay. Its twin island, Little Skellig, is a mile closer to land and far more inhospitable because of its sheer cliff faces. The small Lemon Rock island is further inland. The nearby Puffin Island is another seabird colony. The Skelligs, along with some of the Blasket Islands, constitute the most westerly part of both Ireland and Europe excluding Iceland.

The island is defined by its two peaks: the north-east summit where the monastery is built (185 metres above sea level), and the south-west point containing the hermitage (218 metres above sea level). These elevations reside on either side of a depression colloquially known as Christ&#x27;s Saddle.

===Geology===

The islands are composed of Old Red Sandstone and compressed slate, and were formed between 360 and 374 million years ago, as part of the rising of the MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks and Caha Mountains mountains ranges. This occurred during the Devonian period when Ireland was part of a larger continental landmass and located south of the equator. The region&#x27;s topography of peaks and valleys are characterised by steep ridges formed during the Hercynian period of folding and mountain formation some 300 million years ago. When the Atlantic ocean level rose, it created deep marine inlets such as Bantry Bay and left the Skelligs detached from the mainland. The rock is highly compressed and contains numerous fracture lines and joints. As a result of erosion along a major north–south-trending fault line containing bedrock much more brittle than that on surrounding areas, a large part of the rock broke away, resulting in Christ&#x27;s Saddle, the depression between the peaks. The island&#x27;s rock is deeply eroded through exposure to wind and water.

The Wailing Woman rock lies in the centre of the island, on the ascent before the Christ&#x27;s Saddle ridge, above sea level, on of grassland. It is the only flat and fertile part of the island, and thus contains traces of medieval crop farming. The path from the Saddle to the summit is known as the Way of the Christ, a nomenclature that reflects the danger presented to climbers. Notable features on this stretch include the Needle&#x27;s Eye peak, a stone chimney above sea level, and a series of 14 stone crosses with names such as the &quot;Rock of the Women&#x27;s piercing caoine&quot;, further references to the harsh climb. Further up is the Stone of Pain area, including the station known as the Spit, a long and narrow fragment of rock approached by steps. The ruin of the medieval church is lower and approached before the older monastery.

===Coves===
The island&#x27;s three main coves are Blind Man&#x27;s Cove to the east, Cross Cove to the south and Blue Cove to the north. Each can be used as access points from the sea. All three have steps carved into the rock from their landing point to above sea level. The main landing cove is on the recesses of the eastern side; known as Blind Man&#x27;s Cove, it is exposed to sea swells and high waves, making approach difficult outside the summer months. The bay&#x27;s pier is positioned under a sheer cliff face, populated by large numbers of birds. It was built in 1826 from an area known as the Flagstaff and leads to a small stairway leading to the now disused lighthouse. The steps divide into two staircases, the earliest and largely abandoned path leading directly to the monastery.

Blue Cove is the most difficult landing point and is only approachable on an average of 20 days per year. Noting the inaccessibility of the island, writer Des Lavelle observes that &quot;the fact that the monks of old undertook the giant task of constructing a stairway to this bleak cove is a good argument that the weather conditions then were far better than now.&quot;

==Ecology==

Skellig Michael is lined by exposed sea cliffs and three bays. Its inland is mostly of thin soil on steep ground, with patches of vegetation which are, however, exposed to sea spray. Nonetheless, it has an ecology far more diverse than on the mainland; as an island, it provides sanctuary to wide varieties of flora and fauna, many of which are unusual to Ireland. It contains a large range of seabirds, now protected by the island&#x27;s status as a nature reserve owned by the state. The Skellig Islands were classified as a Special Protection Area in 1986 when they were recognised for containing an unusually large variety and population of birds.
The island hosts eyries for peregrine falcons. Other birds of interest include fulmars, Manx shearwaters (&quot;Puffinus puffinus&quot;), storm petrels, gannets, kittiwakes, guillemots and Atlantic puffins. A herd of goats lived on the island until recently, and it supports a population of rabbits and house mice, both relatively recent introductions, probably introduced in the 19th century by lighthouse attendants. Grey seals haul out on the island&#x27;s ledges.
==History==
===Monastic===

Gaelic Christian monks founded a monastery on Skellig Michael sometime between the 6th and 8th centuries. Like many early Christian sites in Kerry, it is said to have been founded by Saint Fionán in the early 6th century, though this is doubted by historians. Many of the islands off the south-west coast of Ireland have early Christian monasteries; the region was favoured because of its isolation and the abundance of rock for building. There is a concentration of monasteries off the Iveragh and Dingle peninsulas.

The first definite reference to monastic activity on the island is a record of the death of &quot;Suibhini of Skelig&quot; dating from the 8th century. The &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; detail events at the Skelligs between the 9th and 11th centuries. The annals record a Viking attack in 823, when &quot;Skellig was plundered by the heathen and Eitgal [the abbot] was carried off and he died of hunger&quot;. The Vikings again attacked in 838, sacking churches at Skellig, Kenmare, and Innisfallen Island. The Augustinian abbey in Ballinskelligs was founded in 950, the same year that Blathmhac of Sceilic died. Finally, the annals mention the death of Aedh of Scelic-Mhichíl in 1040. 
It has been estimated that no more than twelve monks and an abbot lived at the monastery at any one time. It was continuously occupied until the late 12th or early 13th century and remained a site for pilgrimage through to the modern era. The diet of the island monks was somewhat different from that of those on the mainland. With less arable land available to grow grain, vegetable gardens were an important part of monastic life. Of necessity, fish and the meat and eggs of birds nesting on the islands were staples. Theories for the site&#x27;s abandonment include that the climate around Skellig Michael became colder and more prone to storms, Viking raids, and changes to the structure of the Irish Church. Probably a combination of these factors prompted the community to abandon the island and move to the abbey in Ballinskelligs.

The site had been dedicated to Saint Michael the Archangel by at least 1044 (when the death of Aedh of Scelic-Mhichíl is recorded). However, this dedication may have occurred as early as 950, around which time a new church was added to the monastery (typically done to mark a consecration) and named Saint Michael&#x27;s Church. The island may have been dedicated to Saint Michael, the legendary slayer of serpents, based on a link to Saint Patrick. A 13th-century German source claims that Skellig was the location of the last battle between Patrick and the venomous snakes that plagued Ireland. 

Skellig Michael was a regular destination for pilgrims by the early 16th century.

===Post-monastic===

Skellig Michael remained in the possession of the Catholic Canons Regular until the dissolution of Ballinskelligs Abbey in 1578, a result of the reformation by Elizabeth I. Ownership of the islands passed to the Butler family (for rental of &quot;two hawks and a quantity of puffin feathers yearly&quot;), with whom it stayed until the early 1820s when the Corporation for Preserving and Improving the Port of Dublin (predecessor to the Commissioners of Irish Lights) purchased the island for £500 from John Butler of Waterville in a compulsory purchase order. The corporation constructed two lighthouses on the Atlantic side of the island, and associated living quarters, all of which was completed by 1826.

In 1871, Lord Dunraven, in his &quot;Notes on Irish Architecture&quot;, made the first comprehensive archaeological survey of the island. Describing the monastery, he wrote &quot;the scene is one so solemn and so sad that none should enter here but the pilgrim and the penitent. The sense of solitude, the vast heaven above and the sublime monotonous motion of the sea beneath would oppress the spirit, were not that spirit brought into harmony.&quot; He was less charitable of the lighthouse project and described their alterations as attributed to &quot;the lighthouse workmen who...in 1838, built some objectionable modern walls&quot;. The Office of Public Works took the remains of the monastery into guardianship in 1880, before purchasing the island (with the exception of the lighthouses and associated structures) from the Commissioners of Irish Lights.

Skellig Michael was made a World Heritage Site in 1996. The International Council on Monuments and Sites (an advisory body of the World Heritage Committee) described Skellig Michael as of &quot;exceptional universal value&quot;, and a &quot;unique example of an early religious settlement&quot;, while also noting the site&#x27;s preservation as a result of its &quot;remarkable environment&quot;, and its ability to illustrate &quot;as no other site can, the extremes of a Christian monasticism characterising much of North Africa, the Near East and Europe&quot;.

==Monastic features==
===Monastery===

The monastery is built into a terraced shelf above sea level. It contains two oratories, a cemetery, crosses, cross-slabs, six clochán-type domed beehive cells (of which one has fallen) and a medieval church. The cells and oratories are all of dry-built corbel construction, whereas the church, which was constructed at a later date, is of mortared stone.

====Cells====

The largest hut, known as cell A, has a floor area of 14.5 × 3.8 metres, and is 5 metres high. Like the other huts, its internal walls are straight before narrowing to accommodate its dome roof. Protruding stones in the interior, acting as pegs, are placed at about 2.5 metres to support the roof, and in some instances may have supported upstairs living quarters. Protruding stones on the exterior most likely acted as anchors for thatch roofing. Some cells contain recesses that may have been formed to contain cupboards. The main oratory is boat-shaped, and measures 3.6 × 4.3 metres. It has an altar a small window on its eastern wall. The small oratory is situated on its own terrace, at a relative distance from the main complex. It measures 2.4 × 1.8 × 2.4 metres and contains a low door (0.9 × 0.5 metres) and a comparatively large, one-metre-high window on its north-eastern wall.

====St Michael&#x27;s Church ====
St. Michael&#x27;s Church dates to the 10th or early 11th century. It was originally constructed from mostly lime mortar with imported sandstone from Valentia Island. It is today mostly collapsed, with only its eastern window still standing. The centre of the church contains a modern gravestone, dated 1871, erected for members of the family of one of the lighthouse keepers.

====Monk&#x27;s Graveyard====
The Monk&#x27;s Graveyard is partially collapsed and smaller than when it was in active use. It contains stone crosses with mostly plain inscribed decorative patterns on its west side, two of which are highly detailed and believed to be early features of the site; in total over a hundred individual stone crosses have been found on the island. There are several large orthostats on its north and west sides. There are two dry stone leachta on the site. The larger is positioned between Saint Michael&#x27;s Church and the main Oratory, and is thought to pre-date both, and once had a large upright cross at its western end, which is now broken off. The other is located against the monastery retaining wall at the south of the oratory. Human remains have been found underneath both.

====Oratory====

The oratory is two hundred metres above sea level and fifteen metres below the summit, is the largest and is in good condition. The main oratory is still largely intact and contains its original altar, bench, a water cistern and what is likely the remnants of a shrine. The masonry work is typical of the Early Christian period in Ireland. 

The interior of the main building is long and wide. The enclosure wall is made from mostly small stones. Although it is now worn and mostly knocked down, it would once have been around high. Today the interior is full of stone rubble fallen from the structure and the fragments of a tall stone cross. The leacht outside of it was probably used as a shrine or altar; it is too small to have been a burial site.

===Hermitage===
The hermitage is on the opposite side of the island to the monastery. It is located below the south peak and is significantly more difficult and hazardous to approach. Today access is restricted, and permitted only after prior arrangement. The south peak is approached from Christ&#x27;s Saddle, via a very narrow and steep series of rock-cut steps. These are exposed on all sides to high winds, at times at near-hurricane force. The pathway passes through the Needle&#x27;s Eye, a rock chimney formed by a narrow vertical crack in the peak.

Though the hermitage&#x27;s origins and history are not as well studied as that of the monastery, it seems likely that the hermitage was built later; given the presumed difficulty of its construction, which would have involved the movement of large pieces of stone up almost sheer cliff faces, the builders would have needed the monastery as a base. The eroding effect of frost on the island&#x27;s major fault line provided the masons with large amounts of materials for the construction. It consists of several enclosures and platforms situated on three main terraces cut into the rock. These terraces are today known as the Oratory, Garden and Outer Terraces.

===Outer terrace===
The outer terrace is situated on three stepped ledges some distance from the main complex and is difficult to access. Its only masonry consists of a wall along its steep and exposed perimeter. Wondering why such an inaccessible and harsh outpost might have been built, the historian Walter Horn wrote that &quot;the goal of an ascetic was not comfort&quot; and recalled that the Cambrai Homily states: &quot;This is our denial of ourselves, if we do not indulge our desires and if we abjure our sins. This is our taking-up of our cross upon us if we receive loss and martyrdom and suffering for Christ&#x27;s sake.&quot;

===Stairs and paths===

Each of the three landing areas lead to long flights of steps (known as the east, south and north steps) built by the first generations of monks to inhabit the island. They may have at one time formed part of a larger network; traces of other, possibly earlier steps have been uncovered elsewhere on the island. Archaeological evidence shows that basal sections of each series of steps were rock-cut, giving way to more stable dry stone masonry once they reached an altitude where the sea waves would no longer weather them. Later the base steps were replaced with dry-stone paths.

The north steps lead from Blue Cove and consist of two long and steep continuous flights known as the upper and lower steps. The upper pathway was built from dry stone but is in very poor condition in places; given the steep face on which they are built, they are prone to erosion and the impact of falling stone from the cliffs directly above. The lower rock-cut portion has been heavily weathered by the sea, and some of the ground around them has collapsed; the portions where steps are lost have been replaced with ramps. A parapet at their lowest base was added in the 1820s, and they were widened during the construction of the lighthouse.
The south steps are most commonly used today and merge with the north steps at Christ&#x27;s Saddle, to lead to the monastery. They cross several archaeological features, including a prayer station and walling. They are in good condition and were probably repaired by the lighthouse builders. Their weakest point, directly above Christ&#x27;s Saddle, suffers wear and tear from continual use by modern visitors and requires continual maintenance. The landing steps may have been built by the lighthouse builders; 14 steps apart from the main landing are virtually inaccessible, stopping short at both ends and leading neither to the sea nor to the highest levels.

The lower part of the east steps above Blind Man&#x27;s Cove was heavily blasted with dynamite in 1820 during the construction of the pier and Lighthouse Road, and are now inaccessible from the landing point. The steps above this level, on a very steep climb along a sheer face, have been subject to conservation, most recently in 2002/2003 when large amounts of overgrowth were removed, and are today in good condition.

==In culture==
In the first episode of the 1969 BBC documentary &quot;&quot;, the art historian Kenneth Clark described the island&#x27;s buildings and pathways as &quot;an extraordinary achievement of courage and tenacity&quot;. He observed that &quot;looking back from the great civilizations of twelfth-century France or seventeenth-century Rome, it is hard to believe, that for quite a long time—almost a hundred years—western Christianity survived by clinging to places like Skellig Michael, a pinnacle of rock eighteen miles from the Irish coast, rising out of the sea&quot;.

Several films and documentaries have used the island as a filming location. The island was used to film the planet Ahch-To in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015) and &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; (2017). Aerial footage of the island was also used in &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019). It also served as a location for the final scene in &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; (1976).

Emma Donoghue&#x27;s 2022 book &quot;Haven&quot; is a fictional account of the first monks settling on Skellig Michael in the 7th century.

==Access and tourism==

Skellig Michael contains three landing points variously used by monks depending on the weather conditions. Today the island receives an average of 11,000 visitors per year. To protect the site, the Office of Public Works limits the number of visitors to 180 per day. The local climate and exposed terrain make the crossing from the mainland to Skellig Michael difficult. Once landed, the island&#x27;s terrain is steep, unprotected and dangerous. The rock is ascended via 600 medieval stone steps leading towards the main island peak.
The island&#x27;s remoteness and inaccessibility have long discouraged visitors, so it is exceptionally well preserved. Tourism began in the late 19th century when a rowing boat could be hired for 25 shillings. It did not become a popular tourist destination until the early 1970s when small chartered passenger boats became more frequent; five were available in 1973 at a price of £3 per person. By 1990, the level of demand had grown to the extent that the Office of Public Works began to organise ten boats departing from four individual harbours.

Each year at least four boat licences are granted to tour operators who run trips to Skellig Michael during the summer season (May to October, inclusive), weather permitting. Even when conditions on the mainland are calm, the sea around the island can be turbulent. The area is a landing point for sea swells travelling in from distant depressions in the Atlantic. The island is lashed by water from all sides, with wave crests breaking at up to 10 metres over the pier and 45 metres along the lighthouse. When such large wave troughs recede, they can often expose ragged seaweed stumps, sponges and anemones on the rock faces, further hampering approach and landing.

A typical visit lasts about six hours. The Office of Public Works emphasises that the journey presents safety challenges. For safety reasons, mainly because the steps are steep, rocky, old and unprotected, climbs are not permitted during wet or windy weather. Dive sites immediately around the rock, mostly around Blue Cove, are permitted in summer.

According to some reports, climate change in the form of increased rainfall, sea swells and more severe storms has threatened Skellig Michael, with tourism likely to be affected by these factors.

<text>The Verde Valley (; ) is a valley in central Arizona in the United States. The Verde River runs through it. The Verde River is one of Arizona&#x27;s last free-flowing river systems. It provides crucial habitat for fish and wildlife, fresh water for local agricultural production, recreational opportunities for locals and tourists alike, and brings clean drinking water to over 2 million people in the greater Phoenix area. The valley is overlooked by Mingus Mountain and the Mogollon Rim. The valley is one of three regions of viticulture in Arizona and contains the Verde Valley AVA.

== History ==
The first notice of this region appears in the report of Antonio de Espejo, who visited in 1583. Little more was recorded until the commencement of prospecting for gold and silver in the 19th century.

== Towns ==
* Camp Verde
* Clarkdale
* Cornville

<doc id="242581" wikidata="Q1955932" url="?curid=242581" title="Mutt and Jeff">
<text>Mutt and Jeff is a long-running and widely popular American newspaper comic strip created by cartoonist Bud Fisher in 1907 about &quot;two mismatched &quot;. It is commonly regarded as the first daily comic strip. The concept of a newspaper strip featuring recurring characters in multiple panels on a six-day-a-week schedule had previously been pioneered through the short-lived &quot;A. Piker Clerk&quot; by Clare Briggs, but it was &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; as the first successful daily comic strip that staked out the direction of the future trend.

&quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; remained in syndication until 1983, employing the talents of several cartoonists, chiefly Al Smith who drew the strip for nearly fifty years. The series eventually became a comic book, initially published by All-American Publications and later published by DC Comics, Dell Comics and Harvey Comics. Later it was also published as cartoons, films, pop culture merchandise and reprints.

==Syndicated success==
Harry Conway &quot;Bud&quot; Fisher was a sports cartoonist for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; in the early 1900s, a time when a newspaper cartoon was single panel. His innovation was to tell a cartoon gag in a sequence, or strip, of panels, creating the first American comic strip to successfully pioneer that since-common format. The concept of a newspaper strip featuring recurring characters in multiple panels on a six-day-a-week schedule actually had been created by Clare Briggs with &quot;A. Piker Clerk&quot; four years earlier, but that short-lived effort did not inspire further comics in a comic-strip format. As comics historian Don Markstein explained,
&quot;A. Mutt&quot;, the comic strip that became better known by its later title, &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot;, debuted on November 15, 1907 on the sports pages of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. The featured character had previously appeared in sports cartoons by Fisher but was unnamed. Fisher had approached his editor, John P. Young, about doing a regular strip as early as 1905, but was turned down. According to Fisher, Young told him, &quot;It would take up too much room, and readers are used to reading down the page, and not horizontally&quot;.

This strip focused on a single main character until the other half of the duo appeared on March 27, 1908. It appeared only in the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, so Fisher did not have the extended lead time that syndicated strips require. Episodes were drawn the day before publication, and frequently referred to local events that were currently making headlines or to specific horse races being run that day. A 1908 sequence about Mutt&#x27;s trial featured a parade of thinly-disguised caricatures of specific San Francisco political figures, many of whom were being prosecuted for graft.

On June 7, 1908, the strip moved off the sports pages and into Hearst&#x27;s &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; where it was syndicated by King Features and became a national hit, subsequently making Fisher the first celebrity of the comics industry. Fisher had taken the precaution of copyrighting the strip in his own name, facilitating the move to King Features and making it impossible for the &quot;Chronicle&quot; to continue the strip using another artist.

A dispute between Fisher and King Features arose in 1913, and Fisher moved his strip on September 15, 1915, to the Wheeler Syndicate (later the Bell Syndicate), who gave Fisher 60% of the gross revenue, an enormous income in those times. Hearst responded by launching a lawsuit which ultimately failed. By 1916, Fisher was earning in excess of $150,000 a year. By the 1920s, merchandising and growing circulation had increased his income to an estimated $250,000.

In 1918, &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; added a Sunday strip and, as success continued, Fisher became increasingly dependent on assistants to produce the work. Fisher hired Billy Liverpool and Ed Mack, artists Hearst had at one point groomed to take over the strip, who did most of the artwork. Other assistants on the strip included Ken Kling, George Herriman, and Maurice Sendak (while still in high school).

Fisher appeared to lose all interest in the strip during the 1930s, and after Mack died in 1932, the job of creating the strip fell to Al Smith. In c. 1944, the new Chicago-based Field Syndicate took over the strip. &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; retained Fisher&#x27;s signature until his death, however, so it wasn&#x27;t until December 7, 1954, that the strip started being signed by Smith.

Al Smith received the National Cartoonists Society Humor Comic Strip Award in 1968 for his work on the strip. Smith continued to draw &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; until 1980, two years before it ceased publication.

In the introduction to &quot;Forever Nuts: The Early Years of Mutt &amp; Jeff&quot;, Allan Holtz gave the following reason for the strip&#x27;s longevity and demise:

During this final period it was drawn by George Breisacher. Currently, Andrews McMeel Syndication continues to syndicate &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; under the imprint &quot;Classic Mutt and Jeff&quot; (in both English and Spanish language versions) under the copyright of Pierre S. de Beaumont (1915–2010), founder of the Brookstone catalog and retail chain. De Beaumont inherited ownership of the strip from his mother, Aedita de Beaumont, who married Fisher in 1925 (the couple parted after four weeks, but never divorced).
==Characters and story==

Augustus Mutt is a tall, dimwitted racetrack character—a fanatic horse-race gambler who is motivated by greed. Mutt has a wife, known only as Mrs. Mutt (Mutt always addressed her as &quot;M&#x27;love&quot;; Al Smith revealed in a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; newspaper column that her first name was Ima – and conceded that he did not use it often because it was not a complimentary name). The Mutts&#x27;s son was named Cicero. Mutt first encountered the half-pint Jeff, an inmate of an insane asylum who shares his passion for horse racing, in 1908. They appeared in more strips together until the strip abandoned the horse-race theme to concentrate on Mutt&#x27;s other outlandish, get-rich-quick schemes. Jeff usually served as a (sometimes unwilling) partner. Jeff was short, bald as a billiard ball, and had mutton chop sideburns. He has no last name, stating his name is &quot;just Jeff—first and last and always it&#x27;s Jeff&quot;. However, at one point late in the strip&#x27;s life, he is identified in the address of a cablegram as &quot;Othello Jeff&quot;. He has a twin brother named Julius. They look so much alike that Jeff, who cannot afford to have a portrait painted, sits for Julius, who is too busy to pose. Rarely does Jeff change from his habitual outfit of top hat and suit with wing collar shirt. Friends of Mutt and Jeff have included Gus Geevem, Joe Spivis, and the English Sir Sidney. Characteristic lines and catchphrases that appeared often during the run of the strip included &quot;Nix, Mutt, nix!&quot;, &quot;For the love of Mike!&quot; and &quot;Oowah!&quot;

The original inspiration for the character of &quot;Jeff&quot; was Jacques &quot;Jakie&quot; Fehr, a tiny () irascible Swiss-born shopkeeper in the village of Occidental, California. One summer day in 1908, Fisher, a member of San Francisco&#x27;s Bohemian Club, was riding the North Pacific Coast narrow gauge railway passenger train northbound to the Bohemian Grove, the club&#x27;s summer campsite. During a stop in Occidental, Fisher disembarked in order to stretch his legs and observed the diminutive walrus-moustached Fehr in heated altercation with the tall and lanky &quot;candy butcher&quot;, who sold refreshments on the train and also distributed newspapers to shops in towns along the train route. The comic potential in this scene prompted Fisher to add the character of Jeff to his &quot;A. Mutt&quot; comic strip, with great success.

==Interactions with real people==

A recurring theme in the strip has the two characters interacting with celebrities, including sports figures, actors, and politicians. They often refer to these real-life people in a chummy way, such as actor &quot;Doug&quot; Fairbanks and President &quot;Herb&quot; Hoover. Sometimes they interact with the author, as shown in this 1924 comic in which Fisher includes a caricature of himself.

==&quot;Cicero&#x27;s Cat&quot;==

Starting on October 27, 1926, the Sunday page included a topper strip about Cicero, Mutt&#x27;s son. On December 3, 1933, the topper began to focus on Cicero&#x27;s pet, Desdemona. Under the title &quot;Cicero&#x27;s Cat&quot;, this pantomime strip ran until 1972.
==Comic books and reprints==
* The Cupples &amp; Leon Company produced at least 18 reprint collections of &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; daily strips, in 10&quot; x 10&quot; softcover books from 1919 to 1933. They also published two larger hardcover editions, &quot;Mutt and Jeff BIG Book&quot; (1926) and &quot;Mutt and Jeff BIG Book No. 2&quot; (1929).
* Mutt and Jeff also appeared in comic books. They were featured on the front cover of &quot;Famous Funnies&quot; #1, the first modern format comic book, and reprints appeared in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;All American Comics&quot;. It has been suggested that some of the Mutt and Jeff material published by DC Comics were new stories drawn by Sheldon Mayer.
* In 1939, DC gave them their own comic book, published until 1958 for 103 issues, that consisted entirely of newspaper reprints. Dell Comics took over the feature after DC dropped it, but their tenure only lasted for one year and 12 issues. Many of the Dell issues featured new, conventional-length stories drawn by Smith.
* Harvey Comics, which had several other comic strip reprint comics running at the time, picked up &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; from Dell, and this version of the comic ran to 1965 for a total of 33 issues, plus two short-lived spinoff titles: &quot;Mutt &amp; Jeff Jokes&quot; and &quot;Mutt &amp; Jeff New Jokes&quot;. These later versions also included Smith&#x27;s &quot;Cicero&#x27;s Cat&quot;.
* In 2007, comics publisher NBM published a reprint volume, &quot;Forever Nuts: The Early Years of Mutt &amp; Jeff&quot;. 

==Stage shows and sheet music==
* &quot;Mutt and Jeff: A Musical Comedy Song Book&quot; (1912) Songs include: &quot;The Barn-Yard Rag&quot;; &quot;Sail on Silv&#x27;ry Moon&quot;; &quot;Mr. Ragtime Whippoorwill&quot;; &quot;Oh You Girl!&quot;; &quot;A Mother Old and Gray&quot;; &quot;Let Me Call You Sweetheart&quot;; &quot;Years Years Ago&quot;; &quot;If I Forget&quot;; &quot;Bohemia Rag&quot;; &quot;Undertaker Man&quot;; &quot;Tell Me That You Love Me&quot;
* &quot;The Face in the Flag I Love&quot; (from &quot;Mutt and Jeff in Panama&quot;, 1913)
* &quot;At the Funny Page Ball&quot; (1918)

===Program from &quot;Mutt and Jeff Divorced&quot; (1920)===
==Motion pictures==
===Live-action===

In early July 1911, during the silent era of motion pictures, at David Horsley&#x27;s Nestor Comedies in Bayonne, New Jersey, Al Christie began turning out a weekly one-reel live-action &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; comedy short, which was based on the comic strip.

The &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; serial was extremely popular and after the Nestor Company established a studio in Hollywood, in late October 1911, Christie continued to oversee a weekly production of a one-reel episode.

In the fall of 1911, Nestor began using an alternate method of displaying the intertitles in the &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; comedies. Instead of a cut to the dialogue titles, the dialogue was displayed at the bottom of the image on a black background so the audience could read them as a subtitle, which was similar to the way they appeared in the cartoon strips. Horsley was very proud of the device and claimed to have entered a patent on it. He advertised the &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; movies as &quot;talking pictures&quot;.

The first actors to portray Mutt and Jeff in the comedy shorts were Sam D. Drane, a tall man noted for his resemblance to President Lincoln, whom he actually played in his last movie, &quot;The Crisis&quot; (1916), as A. Mutt, and Gus Alexander, whose nickname was &quot;Shorty,&quot; as Jeff. When Alexander left the serial, Christie hired the actor Bud Duncan. Duncan played Jeff in two installments before the serial ended in 1912.

===Animation===
In 1916, Fisher licensed the production of &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; for animation with pioneers Charles Bowers and Raoul Barré of the Barré Studio. The animated series lasted 11 years and more than 300 animated &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; shorts were released by the Fox Film Corporation, making it the longest continuing theatrical animated movie serial and second longest to &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;.
In 1971, a feature film was released consisting of eleven redrawn colorized Mutt and Jeff silent films, with the short &quot;Slick Sleuths&quot; used as the frame, titled &quot;The Weird Adventures of Mutt &amp; Jeff and Bugoff&quot;, which added new dialogue and soundtrack songs. In this film, Mutt and Jeff are USA government agents, and they have been assigned to track down SMOGPOO&#x27;s top secret agent Bugoff, a master of disguise attempting to steal secrets all across the world. Bugoff is the Phantom character in &quot;Slick Sleuths&quot;, but now he is coloured pink. Radio &amp; Television Packagers, Inc. were the producers of the film, which received a very limited theatrical release, primarily being shown on the 16MM circuit.

In 2005, Inkwell Images released a DVD documentary entitled &quot;Mutt and Jeff: the Original Animated Odd Couple&quot;; several &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; animated cartoons are included on the disc. Also, individual Mutt and Jeff cartoons have been mixed with other titles on low-cost video collections, such as the &quot;Cartoon Craze&quot; DVDs from Digiview Productions. CartoonsOnFilm has been working on a long-term goal of restoring all surviving Mutt and Jeff cartoons.

<text>Anting () is a town in Jiading District, Shanghai, bordering Kunshan, Jiangsu to the west. It has 96,000 inhabitants and, after the July 2009 merger of Huangdu (), an area of .

==Overview==
Anting is one of the centres of the Chinese automotive industry; it is home to Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation and includes the German/Chinese joint venture: Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive. This enterprise has the largest market share of passenger cars in China.

The Shanghai International Circuit, China&#x27;s first Formula One race track, is located near the town, a 15-minute drive away. The Shanghai Auto Museum is also located here, on Boyuan Road.

==Subdivisions==
, Anting is divided into 20 residential communities () and 43 villages, among the most well-known of which is Tamiao (), which is nicknamed the &quot;Auto City&quot;. In the southern part of town, an extension of &quot;Anting Auto City&quot; called &quot;Anting New Town&quot; () is being built in the fashion of &quot;Anting German Town&quot; ().
===German Town===

The first phase of Anting New Town construction will be completed in June 2007, with the second phase slated to begin before the end of 2007, the latter spanning three years. Upon completion the hope is that the resulting town will be a modern community, with a noticeably German urban aesthetic, with a capacity of over 50,000 residents. However, amid tentative financial troubles and poor sales of housing and retail, the phase 2 of Anting New Town may be delayed.

German Town is modelled on a modern German-style town with colourful Bauhaus-type buildings. The district was designed by Frankfurt-based architecture firm Albert Speer &amp; Partner. Speer is the son of the eponymous architect who was Hitler’s chief architect during World War II.

==Transportation==
Anting is served by Line 11 of the Shanghai Metro, connected to the Lifehub shopping center Anting Station. Anting North Railway Station is on the Shanghai–Nanjing Intercity Railway.

==Accommodation==
The first 5* International hotel, Crowne Plaza Shanghai Anting Golf, opened its doors in Anting, Jiading District on 4 September 2012. It is located at 6555 Boyuan Road.

==Entertainment==
Lifehub@Anting, an entertainment complex located just beside the Metro Line 11, provides numerous Clothing outlets, local and international restaurants and coffee shops, a supermarket, film theatre, etc.

<doc id="242589" wikidata="Q259537" url="?curid=242589" title="Ed Wynn">
<text>Isaiah Edwin Leopold (November 9, 1886 – June 19, 1966), better known as Ed Wynn, was an American actor and comedian. He began his career in vaudeville in 1903 and was known for his &quot;Perfect Fool&quot; comedy character, his pioneering radio show of the 1930s, and his later career as a dramatic actor, which continued into the 1960s. His variety show (1949–1950), &quot;The Ed Wynn Show&quot;, won a Peabody Award and an Emmy Award.

==Background==
Wynn was born Isaiah Edwin Leopold in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a Jewish family. His father, Joseph, a milliner, was born in Bohemia. His mother, Minnie Greenberg, of Turkish and Romanian descent, came from Istanbul. Wynn attended Central High School in Philadelphia until age 15. He ran away from home in his teens, worked as a hat salesman and as a utility boy, and eventually adapted his middle name &quot;Edwin&quot; into his new stage name, &quot;Ed Wynn&quot;.

==Career==

Wynn began his career in vaudeville in 1903 and was a star of the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; starting in 1914. During &quot;The Follies of 1915&quot;, W. C. Fields allegedly caught Wynn mugging for the audience under the table during Fields&#x27;s &quot;Pool Room&quot; routine and knocked Wynn unconscious with his cue. Wynn wrote, directed, and produced many Broadway shows in the subsequent decades, and was known for his silly costumes and props as well as for the giggly, wavering voice he developed for the 1921 musical revue &quot;The Perfect Fool&quot;. Wynn became a very active member of The Lambs Club in 1919.
===Radio===

In the early 1930s, Wynn hosted the radio show &quot;The Fire Chief&quot;, heard in North America on Tuesday nights, sponsored by Texaco gasoline. Like many former vaudeville performers who turned to radio in the same decade, the stage-trained Wynn insisted on playing for a live studio audience, doing each program as an actual stage show, using visual bits to augment his written material, and in his case, wearing a colorful costume with a red fireman&#x27;s helmet. He usually bounced his gags off announcer/straight man Graham McNamee; Wynn&#x27;s customary opening, &quot;Tonight, Graham, the show&#x27;s gonna be different,&quot; became one of the most familiar tag-lines of its time; a sample joke: &quot;Graham, my uncle just bought a new second-handed car... he calls it Baby! I don&#x27;t know, it won&#x27;t go anyplace without a rattle!&quot; 

Wynn reprised his Fire Chief radio character in two films, &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; (1930) and &quot;The Chief&quot; (1933). Near the height of his radio fame (1933) he founded his own short-lived radio network the Amalgamated Broadcasting System, which lasted only five weeks, nearly destroying the comedian. According to radio historian Elizabeth McLeod, the failed venture left Wynn deep in debt, divorced and finally, suffering a nervous breakdown.

Wynn was offered the title role The Wizard in MGM&#x27;s 1939 screen adaptation of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, but turned it down, as did his Ziegfeld contemporary W. C. Fields. The part went to Frank Morgan.

===Television===

Ed Wynn first appeared on television on July 7, 1936, in a brief, ad-libbed spot with Graham McNamee during an NBC experimental television broadcast. In the 1949–1950 season, Wynn hosted &quot;The Ed Wynn Show&quot;, one of the first network, comedy-variety television shows, on CBS, and won both a Peabody Award and an Emmy Award in 1949. Buster Keaton, Carmen Miranda, Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Hattie McDaniel and The Three Stooges all made guest appearances with Wynn. This was the first CBS variety television show to originate from Los Angeles, which was seen live on the West Coast, but filmed via kinescope for distribution in the Midwestern United States and the Eastern United States, as the national coaxial cable had yet to be completed. Wynn was also a rotating host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Four Star Revue&quot; from 1950 through 1952.

After the end of Wynn&#x27;s third television series, &quot;The Ed Wynn Show&quot; (a short-lived situation comedy on NBC&#x27;s 1958–59 schedule), his son, actor Keenan Wynn, encouraged him to make a career change rather than retire. The comedian reluctantly began a career as a dramatic actor in television and films. Father and son appeared in three productions, the first of which was the 1956 &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; broadcast of Rod Serling&#x27;s play &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot;. Ed was terrified of straight acting, and kept goofing his lines in rehearsal. When the producers wanted to fire him, star Jack Palance said he would quit if they fired Ed. (However, unbeknownst to Wynn, supporting player Ned Glass was his secret understudy in case something &quot;did&quot; happen before air time.) On live broadcast night, Wynn surprised everyone with his pitch-perfect performance, and his quick ad libs to cover his mistakes. A dramatization of what happened during the production was later staged as an April 1960 &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot; episode, &quot;The Man in the Funny Suit&quot;, starring both senior and junior Wynns, with key figures involved in the original production also portraying themselves (including Rod Serling and director Ralph Nelson). Ed and his son also worked together in the Jose Ferrer film &quot;The Great Man&quot;, with Ed again proving his unexpected skills in drama. 
&quot;Requiem&quot; established Wynn as a serious dramatic actor who could easily hold his own with the best. His performance in &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1959) received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. 

Also in 1959, Wynn appeared on Serling&#x27;s TV series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; in &quot;One for the Angels&quot;. Serling, a longtime admirer, had written that episode especially for him, and Wynn later in 1963 starred in the S5 E12 episode &quot;Ninety Years Without Slumbering&quot;. For the rest of his life, Wynn skillfully moved between comic and dramatic roles. He appeared in feature films and anthology television, endearing himself to new generations of fans.

===Cartoons===
Wynn was caricatured in the Merrie Melodies cartoon shorts &quot;Shuffle Off to Buffalo&quot; (1933), &quot;I&#x27;ve Got to Sing a Torch Song&quot; (1933), and as a pot of jam in the Betty Boop short &quot;Betty in Blunderland&quot; (1934).

===Films===

He appeared as the Fairy Godfather in Jerry Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Cinderfella&quot;. His performance as Paul Beaseley in the 1958 film &quot;The Great Man&quot; earned him nominations for a Golden Globe Award for &quot;Best Supporting Actor&quot; and a BAFTA Award for &quot;Best Foreign Actor&quot;. The following year he received his first (and only) nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Mr. Dussell in &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1959). Six years later he appeared in the Bible epic &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;.

===Disney===
Wynn provided the voice of the Mad Hatter in Walt Disney&#x27;s film &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1951) and played The Toymaker alongside Annette Funicello and Tommy Sands in the Christmas operetta film &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; released in 1961.

In Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), he played eccentric Uncle Albert floating around just beneath the ceiling in uncontrollable mirth, singing &quot;I Love to Laugh&quot;.

Re-teaming with the Disney team the following year—in &quot;That Darn Cat!&quot; (1965), featuring Dean Jones and Hayley Mills—Wynn filled out the character of Mr. Hofstedder, the watch jeweler with his bumbling charm. He also had brief roles in &quot;The Absent Minded Professor&quot; (as the fire chief, in a scene alongside his son Keenan Wynn, who played the film&#x27;s antagonist) and &quot;Son of Flubber&quot; (as county agricultural agent A.J. Allen). His final performance, as Rufus in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Gnome-Mobile&quot;, was released a few months after his death.

In addition to Disney films, Wynn was also an actor in the Disneyland production &quot;The Golden Horseshoe Revue&quot;.

==Personal life==
Wynn was married three times. He first married actress Hilda Keenan on September 5, 1914. They eventually divorced on May 13, 1937, after 23 years of marriage. Together, they had a son, actor Keenan Wynn. He married his second wife, Frieda Mierse, on June 25, 1937, but divorced her only two years later on December 12, 1939. He married his third and final wife Dorothy Elizabeth Nesbitt on July 31, 1946. She filed for divorce from Wynn on February 1, 1955, and it was finalized on March 1, 1955.

Wynn was a Freemason at Lodge No. 9 in Pennsylvania.

==Death==

Wynn died on June 19, 1966, in Beverly Hills, California, of esophageal cancer, at the age of 79. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.

His bronze grave marker reads:

Red Skelton, who was discovered by Wynn, stated: &quot;His death is the first time he ever made anyone sad.&quot;

==Legacy==
Wynn&#x27;s distinctive voice continues to be emulated by countless actors and comedians, including Alan Tudyk for the character King Candy in Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;.

Wynn was posthumously named a Disney Legend on August 10, 2013.

In the graphic adventure game &quot;King&#x27;s Quest VI&quot;, the character Jollo is based on his style.

<text>Zinfandel (also known as Primitivo) is a variety of black-skinned wine grape. The variety is grown in over 10 percent of California vineyards. DNA analysis has revealed that it is genetically equivalent to the Croatian grapes Crljenak Kaštelanski and Pribidrag, as well as to the Primitivo variety traditionally grown in Apulia, Italy, where it was introduced in the 18th century, and Kratošija in Montenegro and Macedonia . The grape found its way to the United States in the mid-19th century, where it became known by variations of a name applied to a different grape, likely &quot;Zierfandler&quot; from Austria.

The grapes typically produce a robust red wine, although, in the United States, a semi-sweet rosé (blush-style) wine called White Zinfandel has six times the sales of the red wine. The grape&#x27;s high sugar content can be fermented into levels of alcohol exceeding 15 percent.

The taste of the red wine depends on the ripeness of the grapes from which it is made. Red berry fruit flavors like raspberry predominate in wines from cooler areas, whereas blackberry, anise and pepper notes are more common in wines made in warmer areas and in wines made from the earlier-ripening Primitivo clone.

== History ==

=== Europe (6000 BC – 1870) ===
Archaeological evidence indicates that domestication of &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; occurred in the Caucasus region around 6000 BC, and winemaking was discovered shortly after that. Cultivation of the vine subsequently spread to the Mediterranean and surrounding regions. Croatia once had several indigenous varieties related to Zinfandel, which formed the basis of its wine industry in the 19th century. This diversity suggests that the grapes have been grown in Croatia longer than anywhere else. These varieties were almost entirely wiped out, however, by the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century, eventually reducing Zinfandel to just nine vines of locally-known &quot;Crljenak Kaštelanski&quot; discovered in 2001 on the Dalmatian coast of Croatia.

The first documented use of the term &quot;Primitivo&quot; appears in Italian governmental publications of the 1870s. The name derives from the terms &quot;primativus&quot; or &quot;primaticcio&quot;, which refer to the grape&#x27;s tendency to ripen earlier than other varieties. This name&#x27;s appearance, 40 years after the first documented use of the term &quot;Zinfandel&quot;, was previously thought to suggest that Primitivo was introduced to Italy from across the Atlantic; however, this hypothesis has become unlikely since the discovery of the vine&#x27;s Croatian origin.

Primitivo is now thought to have been introduced as a distinct clone into Italy&#x27;s Apulia region in the 18th century. Don Francesco Filippo Indellicati, the priest of the church at Gioia del Colle near Bari, selected an early (&quot;primo&quot;) ripening plant of the Zagarese variety and planted it in Liponti. This clone ripened at the end of August and became widespread throughout northern Apulia. Cuttings came to the other great Primitivo DOC (&quot;denominazione di origine controllata&quot; or &quot;denomination of controlled origin&quot;) as part of the dowry of the Countess Sabini of Altamura when she married Don Tommaso Schiavoni-Tafuri of Manduria in the late 19th century.

=== United States east coast (1829–1850) ===
The arrival of Zinfandel in the United States may have been via the Imperial Nursery in Vienna, Austria, which probably obtained the vines during the Habsburg monarchy&#x27;s control over the Dalmatian territories of the former Republic of Venice. George Gibbs, a horticulturist on Long Island, received shipments of grapes from Schönbrunn and elsewhere in Europe between 1820 and 1829. Sullivan suggests that the &quot;Black Zinfardel of Hungary&quot; mentioned by William Robert Prince in &quot;A Treatise on the Vine&quot; (1830) may have referred to one of Gibbs&#x27;s 1829 acquisitions. Webster suggests that the name is a modification of the Hungarian &quot;tzinifándli&quot; (&quot;czirifandli&quot;), which derives from the German Zierfandler, a white grape (Grüner Sylvaner) from Austria&#x27;s Thermenregion.

Gibbs visited Boston in 1830, and Samuel Perkins of that city began selling &quot;Zenfendal&quot; soon afterward. In 1830, Gibbs also supplied Prince with &quot;Black St. Peters,&quot; a similar variety that may have come from England, where many vines have &quot;St. Peters&quot; in their names. Little is known about this vine, except that the Black St. Peters that arrived in California in the 1850s was the same as what became known as Zinfandel by the 1870s.

By 1835 Charles M. Hovey, Boston&#x27;s leading nurseryman, was recommending &quot;Zinfindal&quot; as a table grape. It was soon widely grown in heated greenhouses to produce table grapes as early as June. The first reference to making wine from &quot;Zinfindal&quot; appears in John Fisk Allen&#x27;s &quot;Practical Treatise in the Culture and Treatment of the Grape Vine&quot; (1847). Meanwhile, the fad of hothouse cultivation faded in the 1850s as attention turned to the Concord and other grape varieties that could be grown outdoors in Boston.

=== California (1850–1933) ===
Prince and other nurseryman, such as Frederick W. Macondray (future son-in-law of Faxon Atherton), joined the California Gold Rush in the 1850s and took Zinfandel with them. Prince&#x27;s notebook records that the grape dried &quot;perfectly to Raisin&quot; and that he believed his Zinfandel was the same as the &quot;Black Sonora&quot; he found in California. When the vine known as &quot;Black St. Peters&quot; arrived in California, it was initially regarded as a distinct variety, but by the 1870s, it was recognized as the same grape as Zinfandel.

Sacramento nurseryman A.P. Smith listed &quot;Black St. Peter&#x27;s&quot; among the 24 grape varieties he was propagating in a sales catalog in 1856 and he exhibited &quot;Zeinfindall&quot; at the state fair in 1858. Joseph W. Osborne planted Zinfandel from Macondray at his Oak Knoll vineyard just north of Napa, and his wine was much praised in 1857. Planting of Zinfandel boomed soon after, and by the end of the 19th century, it was the most widespread variety in California. 

These Zinfandel old vines are now treasured for the production of premium red wine, but many were ripped up in the 1920s, during the Prohibition years (1920–1933), but not for the obvious reason. Even during the Prohibition, home winemaking remained effectively legal, and some vineyards embraced the sale of grapes for making wine at home. While Zinfandel grapes proved popular among home winemakers living near the vineyards, it was vulnerable to rot on the long journey to East Coast markets. The thick-skinned Alicante Bouschet was less susceptible to rot, so this and similar varieties were widely planted for the home winemaking market. In 1931, 3000 cars – about – of Zinfandel grapes were shipped, compared to 6000 cars of Alicante Bouschet.

===Rediscovery after Prohibition (1933–present)===
By 1930, the wine industry had weakened due to the Great Depression and Prohibition. Many vineyards that survived by supplying the home market were located in California&#x27;s Central Valley, a non-optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel. Thus, the end of Prohibition left a shortage of quality wine grapes, and Zinfandel sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines. However, some producers remained interested in making single varietal red wines.

By the middle of the 20th century, the origins of California Zinfandel had been forgotten. In 1972, one British wine writer wrote, &quot;there is a fascinating Californian grape, the zinfandel, said to have come from Hungary, but apparently, a cépage now unknown there.&quot; In 1974 and 1981, American wine writers described it as &quot;a California original, grown nowhere else&quot; and &quot;California&#x27;s own red grape&quot;.

In 1972, Bob Trinchero of the Sutter Home Winery decided to try draining some juice from the vats to impart more tannins and color to his Deaver Vineyard Zinfandel. He vinified this juice as a dry wine, and tried to sell it under the name of Oeil de Perdrix, a Swiss wine made by this saignée method. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms insisted on an English translation, so he added &quot;White Zinfandel&quot; to the name, and sold 220 cases. At the time, demand for white wine exceeded the availability of white wine grapes, encouraging other California producers to make &quot;white&quot; wine from red grapes, with minimal skin contact. However, in 1975, Trinchero&#x27;s wine experienced a stuck fermentation, a problem in which the yeast dies off before all the sugar is converted to alcohol. He put the wine aside for two weeks, tasted it, and decided to sell this pinker, sugary wine. Just as Mateus Rosé had become a huge success in Europe after World War II, this medium sweet White Zinfandel became immensely popular. White Zinfandel still accounts for 9.9% of U.S. wine sales by volume (6.3% by value), six times the sales of red Zinfandel. Most white Zinfandel is made from grapes grown for that purpose in California&#x27;s Central Valley.

Wine critics considered white Zinfandel to be insipid and uninteresting in the 1970s and 1980s, although modern white Zinfandels have more fruit and less cloying sweetness. Nevertheless, the success of this blush wine saved many old vines in premium areas, which came into their own at the end of the 20th century as red Zinfandel wines came back into fashion. Although the two wines taste dramatically different, both are made from the same (red) grapes but processed differently.

== Relationship to Primitivo, Crljenak Kaštelanski, and Tribidrag ==
Zinfandel was long considered &quot;America&#x27;s vine and wine,&quot; but when University of California, Davis (UCD) professor Austin Goheen visited Italy in 1967, he noticed how the wine made from Primitivo reminded him of Zinfandel. Others also made the connection about that time. Primitivo was brought to California in 1968, and ampelographers declared it identical to Zinfandel in 1972. The first wine made from these California vines in 1975 also seemed identical to Zinfandel. In 1975, Ph.D. student Wade Wolfe showed that the two varieties had identical isozyme fingerprints.

Dr. Lamberti of Bari had suggested to Goheen in 1976 that Primitivo might be the Croatian variety Plavac Mali. By 1982, Goheen had confirmed that they were similar but not identical, probably by isozyme analysis. Some Croatians, however, became convinced that Plavac Mali was the same as Zinfandel, among them Croatian-born winemaker Mike Grgich. In 1991 Grgich and other producers came together as the Zinfandel Advocates and Producers (ZAP) with the objectives of promoting the varietal and wine and supporting scientific research on Zinfandel. With this support, UCD professor Carole Meredith went to Croatia and collected over 150 samples of Plavac Mali throughout Dalmatia, in collaboration with the University of Zagreb.

In 1993, Meredith used a DNA fingerprinting technique to confirm that Primitivo and Zinfandel were clones of the same variety. Comparative field trials have found that &quot;Primitivo selections were generally superior to those of Zinfandel, having earlier fruit maturity, similar or higher yield, and similar or lower bunch rot susceptibility.&quot; This is consistent with the theory that Primitivo was selected as an early-ripening clone of a Croatian grape.

By 1998, Meredith&#x27;s team realized that Plavac Mali was &quot;not&quot; Zinfandel, but that one was the parent of the other. In 2000 they discovered that Primitivo/Zinfandel was one parent of Plavac Mali. The other parent of Plavac Mali was determined by Ivan Pejić and Edi Maletić (University of Zagreb) to be Dobričić, an ancient variety from the Adriatic island of Šolta.

This discovery narrowed down the search to the central Dalmatian coastal strip and its offshore islands. Eventually, a matching DNA fingerprint was found among the samples. The match came from a vine sampled in 2001 in the vineyard of Ivica Radunić in Kaštel Novi. This Crljenak Kaštelanski (&quot;Kaštela Red&quot;) appears to represent Primitivo/Zinfandel in its original home, although some genetic divergence may have occurred since their separation. Meredith now refers to the variety as &quot;ZPC&quot; – Zinfandel / Primitivo / Crljenak Kaštelanski.

This Croatian vineyard contained nine Crljenak Kaštelanski vines mixed with thousands of other vines. In 2002, additional vines, known locally as Pribidrag, were found in the Dalmatian coastal town of Omiš. Both clones are being propagated in California under the aegis of Ridge Vineyards, although virus infections have delayed their release. The first Croatian ZPC wine was made by Edi Maletić in 2005. Meanwhile, plantings of Primitivo have increased in California, where it seems to grow somewhat less vigorously than its sibling. Its wines are reputed to have more blackberry and spice flavors.

The 2012 book &quot;Wine Grapes&quot; Masters of wine Jancis Robinson and Julia Harding and Swiss grape geneticist Dr. José Vouillamoz detail the search for Zinfandel&#x27;s origins. After years of research and DNA testing of vines from vineyards across the globe, a single 90-year-old grapevine from the garden of an elderly lady in Split, Croatia provided the evidence to show that Zinfandel was a Croatian grape that had been known as &quot;Tribidrag&quot; since at least the 15th century.

===Legal issues===
Local wine-labeling regulations are slowly catching up with the DNA evidence, a process that trade disputes have slowed. The European Union recognized Zinfandel as a synonym for Primitivo in January 1999, meaning that Italian Primitivos can be labeled as Zinfandel in the United States and any other country that recognizes EU labeling laws. Italian winemakers have taken advantage of these rules and shipped Primitivo wines to the United States labeled as Zinfandels, with the approval of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).

As of December 2007, the TTB lists both Zinfandel and Primitivo as approved grape varieties for American wines, but they are not listed as synonyms; U.S. producers, therefore, must label a wine according to whether it is Zinfandel or Primitivo. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) proposed in 2002 that they be recognized as synonyms. In July 2008, the proposed regulation (RIN 1513–AA32, formerly RIN 1512-AC65) was withdrawn.

== Distribution and wines ==

=== United States ===
Zinfandel is grown across the continental United States, although California grows the largest proportion. U.S. producers make wine in styles that range from late harvest dessert wines, rosés (White Zinfandel) and Beaujolais-style light reds to big hearty reds and fortified wine in the style of port. The quality and character of American Zinfandel wines largely depend on the climate, location, and age of the vineyard in which they are grown, as well as the technology employed by the winemaker.

Historically, California Zinfandel vines were planted as a field blend interspersed with Durif (Petite Sirah), Carignan, Grenache, Mourvèdre, Mission and Muscat. While most vineyards are now fully segregated, California winemakers continue to use other grapes (particularly Petite Sirah) in their Zinfandel wines. Zinfandel is grown on approximately 11% of California&#x27;s vineyard land area. Around 400,000 short tons (350,000 tonnes) are crushed each year, depending on the harvest, placing Zinfandel third behind Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon and just ahead of Merlot.

====California regions====


As of 2019, there were 39,500 acres planted in Zinfandel in California. Of the state&#x27;s 44 Zinfandel-growing counties, the top 10 hold some 85% of the Zinfandel growing area. 
However, major producing areas such as San Joaquin County, Stanislaus County, and Madera County produce Zinfandel primarily for blends or jug wine.

Certain California regions are regarded as &quot;exceptional&quot; for Zinfandel, each with identifiable flavor characteristics:
* Amador has a reputation for big, full-bodied Zinfandel. These extra-ripe wines have been called jammy, briary, and brambly, having aromas of sweet berries.
* Although the Santa Cruz Mountains AVA in Santa Clara Valley produces Zinfandel from just , the Zinfandel from that region is known for its complexity and depth.
* Sonoma county has a Zinfandel-producing land area second only to that of San Joaquin County. The county contains the warm Dry Creek Valley AVA, known for its juicy Zinfandel with bright fruit, balanced acidity and notes of blackberry, anise, and pepper. Dry Creek Valley produces Zinfandel in a variety of styles ranging from the high-alcohol Amador style to balanced, spicy wines.
* San Luis Obispo, particularly the Paso Robles AVA with its hot days and cool maritime evenings, produces Zinfandel known for being soft and round.
* While the Napa Valley AVA is known primarily for its Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah, Napa also produces Zinfandel wines described as plummy and intense, tasting of red berry fruits with cedar and vanilla. Zinfandel in Napa tends to be made in a claret style like red Bordeaux.
* The Russian River Valley generally produces well during warm vintages. Otherwise, the grapes do not fully ripen, leaving the wines with excessive acidity. The area has mostly &quot;old vine&quot; Zinfandel, characterized as spicy and somewhat lower in alcohol than Zinfandel from other regions.
* Mendocino County Zinfandel wines have been considered high quality, but they are less known because they are not heavily marketed.
* Lodi has some of the oldest Zinfandel vines in California. While often used for White Zinfandel production in the red style, Lodi Zinfandels have a reputation for being juicy and approachable.

=== Italy ===
Most Primitivo is grown in Apulia, a coastal region known as the &quot;heel&quot; of Italy, and it is estimated to be the country&#x27;s 12th most widely planted grape variety. The main three DOC areas are Primitivo di Manduria, Gioia del Colle Primitivo (Riserva) and Falerno del Massico Primitivo (Riserva o Vecchio). The Manduria DOC covers still red wine as well as sweet (Dolce Naturale) and fortified (Liquoroso Dolce Naturale, Liquoroso Secco) wine. Falerno requires a minimum of 85% Primitivo; the others are 100% Primitivo. Gioia del Colle Rosso and Rosato contain 50–60% Primitivo, and Cilento Rosso/Rosato contains around 15%.

Historically, the grape was fermented and shipped north to Tuscany and Piedmont, where it was used as a blending grape to enhance the body of thin red wines produced in those areas. When the link between Primitivo and Zinfandel began to emerge, plantings in the region and production of non-blended varietals increased. Today, most Italian Primitivo is made as a rustic, highly alcoholic red wine with up to 16% alcohol by volume (ABV). Some Italian winemakers age the wines in new American oak to imitate American-style Zinfandel.

===Other locations===

The Croatian form Crljenak Kaštelanski was not bottled in Croatia as a varietal in its own right before the link to Zinfandel was revealed. UCD has since sent clones of both Zinfandel and Primitivo to Professor Maletić in Croatia, which he planted on the island of Hvar. He made his first ZPC wines in Croatia in 2005. There is high demand for red grapes in the country, and the government has supported ongoing research. Figures from the department of viticulture and enology at the University of Zagreb claim that from only 22 vines of Crljenak Kaštelanski in Croatia in 2001, there were about 2,000 vines in 2008.

Old vine Zinfandel plantings dating from the 1930s have been found in Baja California, Mexico. There are also small Zinfandel plantings in Western Australia, Mudgee in New South Wales and the McLaren Vale area of South Australia. South Africa has a small production of Zinfandel, including one estate rated among the country&#x27;s Zinfandel producers and winner of an international prize. In France, there is a single hectare of Zinfandel grown in the Côtes de Thongue region, sold by Domaine de l&#x27;Arjolle.

== Viticulture and winemaking ==
Zinfandel vines are quite vigorous and grow best in warm but not too hot climates because grapes may shrivel in hot weather. Zinfandel&#x27;s thin-skinned grapes grow in large, tight bunches that are sometimes prone to bunch rot. The fruit ripens reasonably early and produces juice with high sugar content. If weather conditions permit, the grapes may be late-harvested to make dessert wine. Zinfandel is often praised for its ability to reflect both its &quot;terroir&quot; and its winemaker&#x27;s style and skill.

The grapes exhibit an uneven pattern of ripening: a single bunch may contain both raisin-like, over-ripe grapes, and green, unripened grapes. Some winemakers choose to vinify the bunches with these varying levels of ripeness, while others hand-harvest the bunches, even by single berries, in multiple passes through the vineyards over several weeks. This extensively laborious practice is one component of the high cost of some Zinfandels.

Red Zinfandel wines have been criticized for being too &quot;hot&quot; (too alcoholic), although modern winemaking techniques have helped make them more approachable. On the other hand, Zinfandel producers such as Joel Peterson of Ravenswood believe that alcohol-removing technologies, such as reverse osmosis and spinning cones, remove a sense of terroir from the wine. If a wine has the tannins and other components to balance 15% alcohol, Peterson argues, it should be accepted on its terms.

Factors that affect the wine&#x27;s flavors include the length of fermentation, length of the maceration period with skin contact, the level of oak aging, and the degrees Brix of the harvested grapes. White Zinfandel is normally harvested early at 20°Bx when the grapes have yet to develop much varietal character, though some examples can develop hints of tobacco and apple skin. At 23°Bx (the degree that most red wine is considered &quot;ripe&quot;), strawberry flavors develop. Cherry flavors appear at 24°Bx followed by blackberry notes at 25°Bx.

<text>Paul Celan (; ), born Paul Antschel, (23 November 1920 – c. 20 April 1970) was a Romanian-born French poet, Holocaust survivor, and literary translator. Celan is regarded as one of the most important figures in German-language literature of the post-World War II era and a poet whose verse has gained an immortal place in the literary pantheon. Celan’s poetry, with its many radical poetic and linguistic innovations, is characterized by a complicated and cryptic style that deviates from poetic conventions.

==Life==
===Early life===
Celan was born into a German-speaking Jewish family in Cernăuți, Bukovina, a region then part of Romania and earlier part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (when his birthplace was known as Czernowitz). His first home was in the Wassilkogasse in Cernăuți. His father, Leo Antschel, was a Zionist who advocated his son&#x27;s education in Hebrew at the Jewish school &quot;Safah Ivriah&quot; (meaning &quot;the Hebrew language&quot;). Celan&#x27;s mother, Friederike (Fritzi) Antschel née Schrager, was an avid reader of German literature who insisted Austrian German be the language of the household. In his teens, Celan became active in Jewish Socialist organizations and fostered support for the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War. His earliest known poem is titled &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day 1938&quot;.

Paul attended the Liceul Ortodox de Băieți No. 1 (Boys&#x27; Orthodox Secondary School No. 1) from 1930 until 1935, Liceul de Băieți No. 2 în Cernăuți (Boys&#x27; Secondary School No. 2 in Cernăuți) from 1935 to 1936, followed by the Liceul Marele Voievod Mihai (Great Prince Mihai Preparatory School, now Chernivtsi School No. 5), where he studied from 1936 until graduating in 1938. At this time Celan secretly began to write poetry.

In 1938, Celan traveled to Tours, France, to study medicine; the Anschluss precluded his study in Vienna, and Romanian schools were harder to get into due to the newly imposed Jewish quota. His journey to France took him through Berlin as the events of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; unfolded, and also introduced him to his uncle, Bruno Schrager, who was later among the French detainees murdered at Birkenau. Celan returned to Cernăuți in 1939 to study literature and Romance languages.

===Life during World War II===
Following the Soviet occupation of Bukovina in June 1940, deportations to Siberia started. A year later, following the reconquest by Romania, Nazi Germany and the then-fascist Romanian regime brought ghettos, internment, and forced labour (see Romania in World War II).

On arrival in Cernăuți in July 1941, the German SS &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot; and their Romanian allies set the city&#x27;s Great Synagogue on fire. In October, the Romanians deported a large number of Jews after forcing them into a ghetto, where Celan translated Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets and continued to write his own poetry. Before the ghetto was dissolved in the fall of that year, Celan was pressed into labor, first clearing the debris of a demolished post office, and then gathering and destroying Russian books.

The local mayor, Traian Popovici, strove to mitigate the harsh circumstances, until the governor of Bukovina had the Jews rounded up and deported, starting on a Saturday night in June 1942. Celan hoped to convince his parents to leave the country so as to escape certain persecution. While Celan was away from home, on 21 June 1942, his parents were taken from their home and sent by train to an internment camp in Transnistria Governorate, where two-thirds of the deportees eventually perished. Celan&#x27;s father likely perished of typhus and his mother was shot after being exhausted by forced labour. Later that year, after being taken to a labour camp in Romania, Celan received reports of his parents&#x27; deaths.

Celan remained imprisoned in a work camp until February 1944, when the Red Army&#x27;s advance forced the Romanians to abandon the camps, whereupon he returned to Cernăuți shortly before the Soviets returned. There, he worked briefly as a nurse in the mental hospital. Friends from this period recall Celan expressing immense guilt over his separation from his parents, whom he had tried to convince to go into hiding prior to the deportations, shortly before their deaths.

===Life after the war===
Considering emigration to Palestine, Celan left Cernăuți in 1945 for Bucharest, where he remained until 1947. He was active in the Jewish literary community as both a translator of Russian literature into Romanian, and as a poet, publishing his work under a variety of pseudonyms. The literary scene of the time was richly populated with surrealists, such as Gellu Naum, Ilarie Voronca, Gherasim Luca, Paul Păun, and Dolfi Trost. It was in this period that Celan developed pseudonyms both for himself and his friends, including the one he took as his pen name. He also met with the poets Rose Ausländer and Immanuel Weissglas, elements of whose works he reused in his poem &quot;Todesfuge&quot;, which first appeared as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Death Tango&quot;) in a Romanian translation of May 1947.

===Emigration and Paris years===
Upon the emergence of the communist regime in Romania at the beginning of 1948, Celan fled Romania for Vienna, Austria. It was there that he befriended Ingeborg Bachmann, who had just completed a dissertation on Martin Heidegger. Celan, however, found only a ruined city divided between Allied powers and which bore little resemblance to the literary, musical, and cultural mecca it had been as the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Furthermore, the urbane, cultured, and sophisticated Viennese Jewish community described by Stefan Zweig in &quot;The World of Yesterday&quot; had been largely annihilated by the Holocaust in Austria. This is why, like the poet Heinrich Heine before him, Celan emigrated to Paris in 1948. In that year his first poetry collection, &quot;Der Sand aus den Urnen&quot; (&quot;Sand from the Urns&quot;), was published in Vienna by A. Sexl. His first few years in Paris were marked by intense feelings of loneliness and isolation, as expressed in letters to his colleagues, including his longtime friend from Cernăuți, Petre Solomon. It was also during this time that he exchanged many letters with Diet Kloos, a young singer and anti-Nazi Dutch Resistance veteran who had witnessed her husband of just a few months being tortured to death. She visited Celan twice in Paris between 1949 and 1951.

In 1952, Celan&#x27;s writing began to gain recognition when he read his poetry on his first reading trip to West Germany where he was invited to read at the semiannual meetings of the hugely influential Group 47 literary group. At their May meeting he read his poem &quot;Todesfuge&quot; (&quot;Death Fugue&quot;), a depiction of concentration camp life. When Ingeborg Bachmann, with whom Celan had an affair, won the group&#x27;s prize instead for her poetry collection &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Extended Hours&quot;), Celan (whose work had received only six votes) said &quot;After the meeting, only six people remembered my name&quot;. He did not attend any other meeting of the group.

In November 1951, he met the graphic artist Gisèle Lestrange, in Paris. He sent her many love letters, influenced by Franz Kafka&#x27;s correspondence with Milena Jesenská and Felice Bauer. They married on 21 December 1952, despite the opposition of her aristocratic family. During the following 18 years they wrote over 700 letters; Celan&#x27;s active correspondents also included Hermann Lenz and his wife Hanne. He made his living as a translator and lecturer in German at the École normale supérieure. He was a close friend of Nelly Sachs, who later won the Nobel Prize for literature.

Celan became a French citizen in 1955 and lived in Paris. Celan&#x27;s sense of persecution increased after the widow of a friend, the French-German poet Yvan Goll, unjustly accused him of having plagiarised her husband&#x27;s work. Celan was awarded the Bremen Literature Prize in 1958 and the Georg Büchner Prize in 1960.

Celan drowned in the river Seine in Paris around 20 April 1970. It may have been suicide, and if so, perhaps related to the appearance of Weissglas&#x27;s poem, dated 1944, in the Romanian journal &quot;Neue Literatur&quot;, and fears that he might again be accused unfairly of plagiarism, the initial assertions about which, in 1953, later occasioned four psychotic episodes involving paranoia.

==Poetic style==
In addition to writing poetry (in German and, earlier, in Romanian), he was an extremely active translator and polyglot, translating literature from Romanian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Hebrew, and English into German. Meanwhile, Celan&#x27;s own poetry became progressively more cryptic, fractured and monosyllabic, often deviating from conventional poetic meter and verse structures. He created and used German neologisms, especially in his later works &quot;Fadensonnen&quot; (&quot;Threadsuns&quot;) and &quot;Lichtzwang&quot;. Celan has been seen as attempting either to destroy or remake the German language in his poetry, using it to convey dense imagery and subjective experiences; he described this stance in a letter to his wife Gisèle Lestrange as feeling as though &quot;the German I talk is not the same as the language the German people are talking here&quot;.

The death of his parents and the trauma of the Holocaust are regarded by scholars as being defining forces in Celan&#x27;s poetry and his use of language. In his Bremen Prize speech, Celan said of language after Auschwitz that:
Celan also said: &quot;There is nothing in the world for which a poet will give up writing, not even when he is a Jew and the language of his poems is German.&quot;

His masterpiece, &quot;Todesfuge&quot;, may have drawn some key motifs from the poem &quot;ER&quot; by his fellow Romanian poet Immanuel Weissglas, another Czernovitz poet. The characters of Margarete and Sulamith, with their respectively golden and ashen hair, can be interpreted as a reflection of Celan&#x27;s Jewish-German culture, while the blue-eyed &quot;Master from Germany&quot; embodies German Nazism.

==Awards==
* Bremen Literature Prize 1958
* Georg Büchner Prize 1960

== Significance ==
Philosophers including Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and Hans-Georg Gadamer devoted at least one of their books to the poetics of Celan&#x27;s work. He has been regarded, alongside Goethe, Hölderlin and Rilke, as one of the most significant German poets, and a radical innovator of German-language literature. Despite the difficulty of his work, his poetry is thoroughly researched, with the total number of scholarly papers numbering in the thousands.

==In film==

&quot;The Dreamed Ones&quot; (&quot;Die Geträumten&quot;; 2016), is a feature film based on the almost 20-year correspondence between Celan and poet Ingeborg Bachmann. It was directed by Ruth Beckermann, and won several awards.

Celan is featured as an inspiration for the work of Anselm Kiefer, who reads Celan&#x27;s poem Todesfuge, in Wim Wenders&#x27; 2023 3D movie Anselm.

====About translations====
About translating David Rokeah from Hebrew, Celan wrote: &quot;David Rokeah was here for two days, I have translated two poems for him, mediocre stuff, and given him comments on other German translation, suggested improvements ... I was glad, probably in the wrong place, to be able to decipher and translate a Hebrew text.&quot;

<text>A fisherman or fisher is someone who captures fish and other animals from a body of water, or gathers shellfish.

Worldwide, there are about 38 million commercial and subsistence fishers and fish farmers. Fishermen may be professional or recreational. Fishing has existed as a means of obtaining food since the Mesolithic period.

== History ==
 

Fishing has existed as a means of obtaining food since the Mesolithic period. Fishing had become a major means of survival as well as a business venture.

Fishing and fishermen have also influenced Ancient Egyptian religion; mullets were worshipped as a sign of the arriving flood season. Bastet was often manifested in the form of a catfish. In ancient Egyptian literature, the process that Amun used to create the world is associated with the tilapia&#x27;s method of mouth-brooding.
==Commerce==

According to the FAO, there were about 39 million fishermen in countries producing more than 200,000 tonnes in 2012, which is nearly 140% the number in 1995. The total fishery production of 66 million tonnes equated to an average productivity of 3.5 tonnes per person.

Most of this growth took place in Asian countries, where four-fifths of world fishermen and fish farmers dwell.

Most fishermen are involved in offshore and deep-sea fisheries. Women and men fish in some regions inshore from small boats or collect shellfish and seaweed. In many artisanal fishing communities, women or men are responsible for making and repairing nets, post-harvest processing and marketing.

==Recreation==
Recreational fishing is fishing for pleasure or competition. It can be contrasted with commercial fishing, which is fishing for economic profit, or subsistence fishing, which is fishing for survival.

The most common form of recreational fishing is done with a rod, reel, line, hooks and any one of a wide range of baits. Lures are frequently used in place of bait. Some people make handmade lures, including plastic lures and artificial flies.

The practice of catching or attempting to catch fish with a hook is called angling, and fishers using this technique are sometimes referred to as &quot;anglers&quot;. When angling, it is sometimes expected or required that the fish be caught and released. Big-game fishing is fishing from boats to catch large open-water species such as tuna, sharks and marlin. Noodling and trout tickling are also recreational activities.

==Communities==

For some communities, fishing provides not only a source of food and work but also community and cultural identity.

==Safety issues==

The fishing industry is hazardous for Artisan fishers. Between 1992 and 1999, US commercial fishing vessels averaged 78 deaths per year. The main contributors to fatalities are:
* inadequate preparation for emergencies
* poor vessel maintenance and inadequate safety equipment
* lack of awareness of or ignoring stability issues.
Many fishermen, while accepting that fishing is dangerous, staunchly defend their independence. Many proposed laws and additional regulation to increase safety have been defeated because fishers oppose them.
===Alaska===
Alaska&#x27;s commercial fishermen work in one of the world&#x27;s harshest environments. The hardships they endure include isolated fishing grounds, high winds, seasonal darkness, very cold water, icing, and short fishing seasons, when very long work days are the norm. Fatigue, physical stress, and financial pressures face most Alaska fishermen through their careers. Out of 948 work-related deaths in Alaska during 1990–2006, one-third (311) were of fishermen. This is estimated to be equivalent to an annual fatality rate of 128 per 100,000 workers/year. This fatality rate is 26 times the overall U.S. work-related fatality rate of about 5 per 100,000 workers/year for the same time period.

While the work-related fatality rate for commercial fishermen in Alaska is still very high, it does appear to be decreasing: since 1990, there has been a 51 percent decline in the annual fatality rate. The successes in commercial fishing are due in part to the U.S. Coast Guard implementing new safety requirements in the early 1990s. These safety requirements contributed to 96 percent of commercial fishermen surviving vessel sinkings/capsizings in 2004, whereas in 1991, only 73 percent survived. While the number of occupational deaths of commercial fishermen in Alaska has been reduced, there is a continuing pattern of losing 20 to 40 vessels every year. There are still about 100 fishermen who must be rescued each year from cold Alaska waters. Successful rescue is still dependent on the expertly trained personnel of the US Coast Guard Search and Rescue operations, but their efforts can be hindered by the harshness of seas and the weather. Furthermore, the people involved in Search and Rescue operations are themselves at considerable risk of injury or death during these rescue attempts.

<doc id="242596" wikidata="Q217434" url="?curid=242596" title="Grant Wood">
<text>Grant DeVolson Wood (February 13, 1891February 12, 1942) was an American artist and representative of Regionalism, best known for his paintings depicting the rural American Midwest. He is particularly well known for &quot;American Gothic&quot; (1930), which has become an iconic example of early 20th-century American art.

==Early life==

Wood was born in rural Iowa, 4 mi (6.43 km) east of Anamosa, on February 13, 1891, the son of Hattie DeEtte Wood (&quot;née&quot; Weaver) and Francis Maryville Wood. Hattie moved the family to Cedar Rapids after Francis died in 1901. Soon thereafter, Wood began as an apprentice in a local metal shop. After graduating from Washington High School, he enrolled in The Handicraft Guild, an art school run entirely by women in Minneapolis in 1910.

In 1913, Wood enrolled at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he studied from 1913 to 1916. Wood also performed some work as a silversmith.

==Career==
Near the end of World War I, Wood joined the army, working as an artist designing camouflage scenes as well as other art.

From 1919 to 1925, Wood taught art to junior high school students in the Cedar Rapids public school system. This employment provided financial stability, and its seasonal nature allowed him summer trips to Europe to study art. Wood also took a leave of absence for the 1923–1924 school year so he could spend an entire year studying in Europe. During his stint as a teacher, Wood experimented with woodworking and metalworking. For example, he built a bench for students who broke the rules to sit on while waiting punishment from the school principal, which Wood titled &quot;Mourner&#x27;s Bench&quot;, a humorous reference to the mourner&#x27;s bench used in Methodist churches. 

From 1924 to 1935, Wood lived with his mother in the hayloft of a carriage house in Cedar Rapids, which he had converted into his personal studio at &quot;5 Turner Alley&quot; (the studio had no address until Wood made one up).

Between 1922 and 1928, Wood made four trips to Europe, where he studied many styles of painting, especially Impressionism and post-Impressionism. However, it was the work of the 15th-century Flemish artist Jan van Eyck that influenced him to take on the clarity of this technique and incorporate it in his new works. Additionally, Wood&#x27;s 1928 trip to Munich was to oversee the making of the stained glass windows he had designed for a Veterans Memorial Building in Cedar Rapids.

In 1932, Wood helped found the Stone City Art Colony near his hometown to help artists get through the Great Depression. He became a great proponent of regionalism in the arts, lecturing throughout the country on the topic. As Wood&#x27;s classically American image was solidified, his bohemian days in Paris were expunged from his public persona.

In 1934, Wood was offered a position working and teaching in Iowa City as Director of a New Deal Public Works of Art Project (PWAP). While headquartered in Iowa City and associated with the University of Iowa, he assisted other artists and art students in producing a set of murals for Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. Once his PWAP concluded in 1934, the University of Iowa offered Wood a three-year-term as an Associate Professor of Fine Art. He taught painting at the university&#x27;s School of Art until 1941. During that time, Wood supervised mural painting projects, mentored students including Elizabeth Catlett, produced a variety of his own works, and became a key part of the university&#x27;s cultural community.

==Work==

Wood was an active painter from an extremely young age until his death, and although best known for his paintings, Wood worked in a large number of media, including lithography, ink, charcoal, ceramics, metal, wood and found objects.

Throughout his life, Wood hired out his talents to many Iowa-based businesses as a steady source of income. This included painting advertisements, sketching rooms of a mortuary house for promotional flyers and, in one case, designing the corn-themed décor (including chandelier) for the dining room of a hotel.

===Regionalism===
Wood is associated with the American movement of Regionalism, which was primarily situated in the Midwest, and advanced figurative painting of rural American themes in an aggressive rejection of European abstraction.

Wood was one of three artists most associated with the movement. The others, John Steuart Curry and Thomas Hart Benton, returned to the Midwest in the 1930s due to Wood&#x27;s encouragement and assistance with locating teaching positions for them at colleges in Wisconsin and Missouri, respectively. Along with Benton, Curry, and other Regionalist artists, his work was marketed through Associated American Artists in New York for many years. Wood is considered the patron artist of Cedar Rapids, and his childhood country school is depicted on the 2004 Iowa State Quarter.

===&quot;American Gothic&quot;===
Wood&#x27;s best known work is his 1930 painting &quot;American Gothic&quot;, which is also one of the most famous paintings in American art, and one of the few images to reach the status of widely recognized cultural icon, comparable to Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and Edvard Munch&#x27;s &quot;The Scream&quot;.

&quot;American Gothic&quot; was first exhibited in 1930 at the Art Institute of Chicago, where it is still located. It was awarded a $300 prize and made news stories nationwide, bringing Wood immediate recognition. Since then, it has been borrowed and satirized endlessly for advertisements and cartoons.

Art critics who had favorable opinions about the painting, such as Gertrude Stein and Christopher Morley, assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of repression and narrow-mindedness of rural small-town life. It was seen as part of the trend toward increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of such novels as Sherwood Anderson&#x27;s 1919 &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;, Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s 1920 &quot;Main Street&quot;, and Carl Van Vechten&#x27;s &quot;The Tattooed Countess&quot;. Wood rejected this reading of it. With the onset of the Great Depression, it came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit. Another reading is that it is an ambiguous fusion of reverence and parody.

Wood&#x27;s inspiration came from Eldon, southern Iowa, where a cottage designed in the Gothic Revival style with an upper window in the shape of a medieval pointed arch provided the background and also the painting&#x27;s title. Wood decided to paint the house along with &quot;the kind of people I fancied should live in that house.&quot; The painting shows a farmer standing beside his spinster daughter, figures modeled by the artist&#x27;s sister, Nan (1900–1990), and his dentist. Wood&#x27;s sister insisted that the painting depicts the farmer&#x27;s daughter, disliking suggestions it was the farmer&#x27;s wife, since that would mean that she looked older than she preferred to think of herself. The dentist, Dr. Byron McKeeby (1867–1950), was from Cedar Rapids. The couple are in the traditional roles of men and women, the man&#x27;s pitchfork symbolizing hard labor. The woman is dressed in a dark print apron mimicking 19th-century Americana with a cameo brooch.

The compositional severity and detailed technique derive from Northern Renaissance paintings, which Wood had seen during his visits to Europe; after this he became increasingly aware of the Midwest&#x27;s own legacy, which also informed the work. It is a key image of Regionalism.

In 1940, Wood and eight other prominent American artists were hired to document and interpret dramatic scenes and characters during the production of the film &quot;The Long Voyage Home&quot;, a cinematic adaptation of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s plays.

==Personal life==
Wood was married to Sara Sherman Maxon from 1935 to 1938. Friends considered the marriage a mistake for him.

Wood was a closeted homosexual. There was an unsuccessful attempt by a colleague, Lester Longman, to get him fired both on explicit moral grounds and for his advocacy of regionalism. Critic Janet Maslin states that his friends knew him to be &quot;homosexual and a bit facetious in his masquerade as an overall-clad farm boy.&quot; University administration at Iowa dismissed the allegations, and Wood would have returned as professor if not for his growing health problems.
Wood was a Freemason and Member of Mount Hermon Lodge #263 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, from 1921 to 1924. After receiving his third Degree of Master Mason he painted The First Three Degrees of Freemasonry in 1921. However, he was suspended for not paying dues in March 1924, and had no further association with the organization.

On February 12, 1942, Wood died at Iowa City university hospital of pancreatic cancer, one day shy of his 51st birthday. Wood is buried at Riverside Cemetery in Anamosa, Iowa. 

==Legacy==

When Wood died, his estate went to his sister, Nan Wood Graham, the woman portrayed in &quot;American Gothic&quot;. When she died in 1990, her estate, along with Wood&#x27;s personal effects and various works of art, became the property of the Figge Art Museum in Davenport, Iowa.

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

One of Iowa&#x27;s nine regional Area Education Agencies, Grant Wood Area Education Agency was established in 1974 and serves Eastern Iowa.

In 2009, Grant was awarded the Iowa Prize, the state&#x27;s highest citizen honor.

The Grant Wood Art Colony grew out of Jim Hayes’s 1975 purchase of Wood&#x27;s historic Iowa City home at 1142 Court Street. The house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and was featured in the 2016 documentary, &quot;1142: Beyond the Bricks&quot;. Over the years, Hayes purchased four land parcels behind the home. This addition led to the expansion of his vision for 1142 to include a rotating community of artists modeled after the colonies that Wood tried to establish in his lifetime such as the one at Stone City. Hayes partnered with the University of Iowa on his vision, and since 2011, the Grant Wood Art Colony holds a recurring symposium and hosts artist fellows in painting &amp; drawing, printmaking, and interdisciplinary performance. The fellows are provided with furnished living quarters in the houses behind 1142.

<text>George Edward Arcaro (February 19, 1916 – November 14, 1997) was an American Thoroughbred horse racing Hall of Fame jockey who won more American classic races than any other jockey in history and is the only rider to have won the U.S. Triple Crown twice. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest jockeys in the history of American Thoroughbred horse racing. Arcaro was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of an impoverished taxi driver. His parents, Pasquale and Josephine, were Italian immigrants and his father held a number of jobs, including taxi driver and operator of an illegal liquor enterprise during Prohibition. Arcaro was born prematurely, and weighed just three pounds at birth; because of this, he was smaller than his classmates and was rejected when he tried out for a spot on a baseball team. His full height would reach just five-foot, two inches. Eventually nicknamed &quot;Banana Nose&quot; by his confreres, Arcaro won his first race in 1932 at the Agua Caliente racetrack in Tijuana, Mexico; he was 16 years old. In 1934, the inaugural year of Narragansett Park, Arcaro was a comparative unknown who rode many of his early career races at &#x27;Gansett.

==American classic races==
Arcaro won his first Kentucky Derby in 1938 aboard Lawrin. He is tied with Bill Hartack for most Derby wins with five, and has the most wins in the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes with six. He won the U.S. Triple Crown in 1941 on Whirlaway and again in 1948 on Citation. His other Kentucky Derby wins were Hoop Jr. (1945) and Hill Gail (1952). Arcaro also won the most triple crown races at 17 with the next highest total at only 11.

==Major stakes wins==
Arcaro also won the Suburban Handicap eight times, the Wood Memorial Stakes nine times and the Jockey Club Gold Cup ten times.

In international competition, at old Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Arcaro won the 1953 Queen&#x27;s Plate (Canada&#x27;s most prestigious race); at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland, he won the 1954 Washington, D.C. International against the best horses and riders from Europe.

In 1953 Arcaro was voted the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award, and in 1958 he was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York.

Active in jockey affairs, Arcaro was a driving force behind the creation of the Jockeys&#x27; Guild. He retired in 1962, due to severe bursitis in his arm. During his career Arcaro rode in 24,092 races and won 4,779, with record setting earnings of $30,039,543. After working as a television commentator on racing for CBS and ABC, he was a public relations officer for the Golden Nugget Casino in Las Vegas before retiring to Miami, Florida. He also worked as a spokesman for the Buick Motor Division of General Motors, for which he voiced the well-known phrase &quot;If you price a Buick, you&#x27;ll buy a Buick.&quot; For many years, he was the proprietor of a popular Italian restaurant in Beverly Hills.

== Death and legacy ==
According to his wife Vera, Arcaro suffered a long illness. He died at his Miami home in 1997. His body was cremated and his ashes were interred in the at Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Cemetery in Miami. Today, he remains one of the best-known jockeys in the history of horse racing, called &quot;the Master&quot; for his riding skills, good sense of pace and the ability to switch his whip from one hand to the other with ease during a race.

<text>A sesshin (接心, or also 摂心/攝心 literally &quot;touching the heart-mind&quot;) is a period of intensive meditation (zazen) retreat in a Japanese Zen monastery, or in a Zen monastery or Zen center that belongs to one of the Japanese Zen traditions outside of Japan.
While the daily routine in the monastery requires the monks to meditate several hours a day, during a sesshin they devote themselves almost exclusively to zazen practice. The numerous 30- to 50-minute-long meditation periods are interleaved with short rest breaks, meals, and sometimes short periods of work (Japanese: 作務 &quot;samu&quot;) all performed with the same mindfulness; nightly sleep is kept to a minimum, at six hours or fewer. During the sesshin period, the meditation practice is occasionally interrupted by the master giving public talks (teisho) and individual direction in private meetings (which may be called &quot;dokusan&quot;, &quot;daisan&quot;, or &quot;sanzen&quot;) with a Zen Master.

In modern Buddhist practice in Japan and the West, sesshins are often attended by lay students and are typically one, three, five, or seven days in length. Seven-day sesshins are held several times a year at many Zen centers, especially in commemoration of the Buddha&#x27;s awakening to full enlightenment (&quot;anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi&quot;). At this Rohatsu sesshin, practitioners seek to relax and quiet the mind to the point of cessation of mental chatter and emotional impulse, &quot;samadhi&quot;, &quot;kensho&quot;, or &quot;satori&quot;.

== A typical sesshin day ==
A &quot;sesshin&quot; schedule in the West will typically allow anywhere from nine to fifteen periods of &quot;zazen&quot; per day, 30–40 minutes each, with ten-minute periods of walking meditation (&quot;kinhin&quot;) between &quot;zazen&quot; periods. Traditional &quot;sesshin&quot; are more intensive, with meditations lasting 30–60 minutes each, with an absence of any rest or work breaks and sleep limited to less than five hours a day.

Meals are taken in a formal meditation ritual of &quot;ōryōki&quot;. Work periods in westernized &quot;sesshin&quot; are sometimes scheduled and may comprise one to two hours of the day, usually in gardening, cooking, or cleaning. The &quot;sesshin&quot; schedule typically allows for four to five hours of sleep per night, though practitioners occasionally will spend much of the next-to-last night of a five- or seven-day &quot;sesshin&quot; in &quot;zazen&quot;. This is called &quot;yaza&quot; and is much revered as a particularly effective time to meditate when the thinking mind and ego lack the energy to derail practice.

It has been reported that at least three days of &quot;sesshin&quot; are usually required for the practitioner to &quot;settle down&quot; into the &quot;sesshin&quot; routine to a point where the mind becomes quiet enough for the deeper types of meditation and &quot;samadhi&quot; to begin.

==Psychological aspects of sesshin==
Some people unfamiliar with the process have reported becoming disoriented and fearful of incurring psychological damage during sesshin. Some Zen centers do not allow novices to attend long sesshins without much prior experience and screening by the practice leaders. Sesshin can lead to deep experiences of awakening that may at times be somewhat traumatic, akin to a &quot;spiritual emergency&quot; or symptoms of Kundalini Syndrome.

While this may seem daunting at first, people who practice regular zazen do not usually have problems with sesshin. Heightening of senses may arise during sesshin. Sometimes practitioners report that food has incredible flavor and colors become more vivid and pronounced.

==Social aspects of sesshin==
There is no talking during sesshin. Silence is observed so that each student may both concentrate on their experience and not influence those of others.

At the end of the sesshin, there is usually a meal when students are allowed to talk to others for the first time since arriving.
