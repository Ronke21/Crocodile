<doc id="244077" wikidata="Q202334" url="?curid=244077" title="List of Roman nomina">
<text>This is a list of Roman nomina. The nomen identified all free Roman citizens as members of individual &quot;gentes&quot;, originally families sharing a single nomen and claiming descent from a common ancestor. Over centuries, a gens could expand from a single family to a large clan, potentially including hundreds or even thousands of members. Some of these may have been the descendants of freedmen or persons who entered the gens through adoption, while in other cases, different families that had assumed the same nomen in the distant past became confused with one another, and came to be regarded as a single gens.

In the following list, &quot;I&quot; and &quot;J&quot; are treated as separate letters, as are &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot;. The letter &quot;K&quot; was rare in Latin, and the few nomina occasionally spelled with this letter were usually spelled with &quot;C&quot;. No Roman gentes began with &quot;X&quot;, and the letters &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; occurred only in names borrowed from Greek. The letter &quot;W&quot; did not exist in Classical Latin. Nomina are given in the masculine form—the form borne by all male members of a gens. The gentes themselves were grammatically feminine.

Those nomina representing gentes for which separate articles exist are linked to those articles; those belonging to only one or two individuals, or known from only a few inscriptions, are not usually linked, but may be cited to the literary sources or inscriptions in which they are attested.

<doc id="244078" wikidata="Q574833" url="?curid=244078" title="Global financial system">
<text>The global financial system is the worldwide framework of legal agreements, institutions, and both formal and informal economic action that together facilitate international flows of financial capital for purposes of investment and trade financing. Since emerging in the late 19th century during the first modern wave of economic globalization, its evolution is marked by the establishment of central banks, multilateral treaties, and intergovernmental organizations aimed at improving the transparency, regulation, and effectiveness of international markets. In the late 1800s, world migration and communication technology facilitated unprecedented growth in international trade and investment. At the onset of World War I, trade contracted as foreign exchange markets became paralyzed by money market illiquidity. Countries sought to defend against external shocks with protectionist policies and trade virtually halted by 1933, worsening the effects of the global Great Depression until a series of reciprocal trade agreements slowly reduced tariffs worldwide. Efforts to revamp the international monetary system after World War II improved exchange rate stability, fostering record growth in global finance.

A series of currency devaluations and oil crises in the 1970s led most countries to float their currencies. The world economy became increasingly financially integrated in the 1980s and 1990s due to capital account liberalization and financial deregulation. A series of financial crises in Europe, Asia, and Latin America followed with contagious effects due to greater exposure to volatile capital flows. The 2008 financial crisis, which originated in the United States, quickly propagated among other nations and is recognized as the catalyst for the worldwide Great Recession. A market adjustment to Greece&#x27;s noncompliance with its monetary union in 2009 ignited a sovereign debt crisis among European nations known as the Eurozone crisis. The history of international finance shows a U-shaped pattern in international capital flows: high prior to 1914 and after 1989, but lower in between. The volatility of capital flows has been greater since the 1970s than in previous periods.

A country&#x27;s decision to operate an open economy and globalize its financial capital carries monetary implications captured by the balance of payments. It also renders exposure to risks in international finance, such as political deterioration, regulatory changes, foreign exchange controls, and legal uncertainties for property rights and investments. Both individuals and groups may participate in the global financial system. Consumers and international businesses undertake consumption, production, and investment. Governments and intergovernmental bodies act as purveyors of international trade, economic development, and crisis management. Regulatory bodies establish financial regulations and legal procedures, while independent bodies facilitate industry supervision. Research institutes and other associations analyze data, publish reports and policy briefs, and host public discourse on global financial affairs.

While the global financial system is edging toward greater stability, governments must deal with differing regional or national needs. Some nations are trying to systematically discontinue unconventional monetary policies installed to cultivate recovery, while others are expanding their scope and scale. Emerging market policymakers face a challenge of precision as they must carefully institute sustainable macroeconomic policies during extraordinary market sensitivity without provoking investors to retreat their capital to stronger markets. Nations&#x27; inability to align interests and achieve international consensus on matters such as banking regulation has perpetuated the risk of future global financial catastrophes. Initiatives like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10 are aimed at improving regulation and monitoring of global financial systems.

==History of international financial architecture ==

===Emergence of financial globalization: 1870–1914===

The world experienced substantial changes in the late 19th century which created an environment favorable to an increase in and development of international financial centers. Principal among such changes were unprecedented growth in capital flows and the resulting rapid financial center integration, as well as faster communication. Before 1870, London and Paris existed as the world&#x27;s only prominent financial centers. Soon after, Berlin and New York grew to become major centres providing financial services for their national economies. An array of smaller international financial centers became important as they found market niches, such as Amsterdam, Brussels, Zürich, and Geneva. London remained the leading international financial center in the four decades leading up to World War I.

The first modern wave of economic globalization began during the period of 1870–1914, marked by transportation expansion, record levels of migration, enhanced communications, trade expansion, and growth in capital transfers. During the mid-nineteenth century, the passport system in Europe dissolved as rail transport expanded rapidly. Most countries issuing passports did not require they be carried, and so people could travel freely without them. The standardization of international passports would not arise until 1980 under the guidance of the United Nations&#x27; International Civil Aviation Organization. From 1870 to 1915, 36 million Europeans migrated away from Europe. Approximately 25 million (or 70%) of these travelers migrated to the United States, while most of the rest reached Canada, Australia and Brazil. Europe itself experienced an influx of foreigners from 1860 to 1910, growing from 0.7% of the population to 1.8%. While the absence of meaningful passport requirements allowed for free travel, migration on such an enormous scale would have been prohibitively difficult if not for technological advances in transportation, particularly the expansion of railway travel and the dominance of steam-powered boats over traditional sailing ships. World railway mileage grew from 205,000 kilometers in 1870 to 925,000 kilometers in 1906, while steamboat cargo tonnage surpassed that of sailboats in the 1890s. Advancements such as the telephone and wireless telegraphy (the precursor to radio) revolutionized telecommunications by providing instantaneous communication. In 1866, the first transatlantic cable was laid beneath the ocean to connect London and New York, while Europe and Asia became connected through new landlines.

Economic globalization grew under free trade, starting in 1860 when the United Kingdom entered into a free trade agreement with France known as the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty. However, the golden age of this wave of globalization endured a return to protectionism between 1880 and 1914. In 1879, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced protective tariffs on agricultural and manufacturing goods, making Germany the first nation to institute new protective trade policies. In 1892, France introduced the Méline tariff, greatly raising customs duties on both agricultural and manufacturing goods. The United States maintained strong protectionism during most of the nineteenth century, imposing customs duties between 40 and 50% on imported goods. Despite these measures, international trade continued to grow without slowing. Paradoxically, foreign trade grew at a much faster rate during the protectionist phase of the first wave of globalization than during the free trade phase sparked by the United Kingdom.

Unprecedented growth in foreign investment from the 1880s to the 1900s served as the core driver of financial globalization. The worldwide total of capital invested abroad amounted to US$44 billion in 1913 ($1.02 trillion in 2012 dollars), with the greatest share of foreign assets held by the United Kingdom (42%), France (20%), Germany (13%), and the United States (8%). The Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland together held foreign investments on par with Germany at around 12%.

====Panic of 1907====

In October 1907, the United States experienced a bank run on the Knickerbocker Trust Company, forcing the trust to close on October 23, 1907, provoking further reactions. The panic was alleviated when U.S. Secretary of the Treasury George B. Cortelyou and John Pierpont &quot;J.P.&quot; Morgan deposited $25 million and $35 million, respectively, into the reserve banks of New York City, enabling withdrawals to be fully covered. The bank run in New York led to a money market crunch which occurred simultaneously as demands for credit heightened from cereal and grain exporters. Since these demands could only be serviced through the purchase of substantial quantities of gold in London, the international markets became exposed to the crisis. The Bank of England had to sustain an artificially high discount lending rate until 1908. To service the flow of gold to the United States, the Bank of England organized a pool from among twenty-four nations, for which the Banque de France temporarily lent £3 million (GBP, 305.6 million in 2012 GBP) in gold.

====Birth of the U.S. Federal Reserve System: 1913====

The United States Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, giving rise to the Federal Reserve System. Its inception drew influence from the Panic of 1907, underpinning legislators&#x27; hesitance in trusting individual investors, such as John Pierpont Morgan, to serve again as a lender of last resort. The system&#x27;s design also considered the findings of the Pujo Committee&#x27;s investigation of the possibility of a money trust in which Wall Street&#x27;s concentration of influence over national financial matters was questioned and in which investment bankers were suspected of unusually deep involvement in the directorates of manufacturing corporations. Although the committee&#x27;s findings were inconclusive, the very possibility was enough to motivate support for the long-resisted notion of establishing a central bank. The Federal Reserve&#x27;s overarching aim was to become the sole lender of last resort and to resolve the inelasticity of the United States&#x27; money supply during significant shifts in money demand. In addition to addressing the underlying issues that precipitated the international ramifications of the 1907 money market crunch, New York&#x27;s banks were liberated from the need to maintain their own reserves and began undertaking greater risks. New access to rediscount facilities enabled them to launch foreign branches, bolstering New York&#x27;s rivalry with London&#x27;s competitive discount market.

===Interwar period: 1915–1944===

Economists have referred to the onset of World War I as the end of an age of innocence for foreign exchange markets, as it was the first geopolitical conflict to have a destabilizing and paralyzing impact. The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914 following Germany&#x27;s invasion of France and Belgium. In the weeks prior, the foreign exchange market in London was the first to exhibit distress. European tensions and increasing political uncertainty motivated investors to chase liquidity, prompting commercial banks to borrow heavily from London&#x27;s discount market. As the money market tightened, discount lenders began rediscounting their reserves at the Bank of England rather than discounting new pounds sterling. The Bank of England was forced to raise discount rates daily for three days from 3% on July 30 to 10% by August 1. As foreign investors resorted to buying pounds for remittance to London just to pay off their newly maturing securities, the sudden demand for pounds led the pound to appreciate beyond its gold value against most major currencies, yet sharply depreciate against the French franc after French banks began liquidating their London accounts. Remittance to London became increasingly difficult and culminated in a record exchange rate of US$6.50/GBP. Emergency measures were introduced in the form of moratoria and extended bank holidays, but to no effect as financial contracts became informally unable to be negotiated and export embargoes thwarted gold shipments. A week later, the Bank of England began to address the deadlock in the foreign exchange markets by establishing a new channel for transatlantic payments whereby participants could make remittance payments to the U.K. by depositing gold designated for a Bank of England account with Canada&#x27;s Minister of Finance, and in exchange receive pounds sterling at an exchange rate of $4.90. Approximately US$104 million in remittances flowed through this channel in the next two months. However, pound sterling liquidity ultimately did not improve due to inadequate relief for merchant banks receiving sterling bills. As the pound sterling was the world&#x27;s reserve currency and leading vehicle currency, market illiquidity and merchant banks&#x27; hesitance to accept sterling bills left currency markets paralyzed.

The U.K. government attempted several measures to revive the London foreign exchange market, the most notable of which were implemented on September 5 to extend the previous moratorium through October and allow the Bank of England to temporarily loan funds to be paid back upon the end of the war in an effort to settle outstanding or unpaid acceptances for currency transactions. By mid-October, the London market began functioning properly as a result of the September measures. The war continued to present unfavorable circumstances for the foreign exchange market, such as the London Stock Exchange&#x27;s prolonged closure, the redirection of economic resources to support a transition from producing exports to producing military armaments, and myriad disruptions of freight and mail. The pound sterling enjoyed general stability throughout World War I, in large part due to various steps taken by the U.K. government to influence the pound&#x27;s value in ways that yet provided individuals with the freedom to continue trading currencies. Such measures included open market interventions on foreign exchange, borrowing in foreign currencies rather than in pounds sterling to finance war activities, outbound capital controls, and limited import restrictions.

In 1930, the Allied powers established the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The principal purposes of the BIS were to manage the scheduled payment of Germany&#x27;s reparations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, and to function as a bank for central banks around the world. Nations may hold a portion of their reserves as deposits with the institution. It also serves as a forum for central bank cooperation and research on international monetary and financial matters. The BIS also operates as a general trustee and facilitator of financial settlements between nations.

====Smoot–Hawley tariff of 1930====

U.S. President Herbert Hoover signed the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act into law on June 17, 1930. The tariff&#x27;s aim was to protect agriculture in the United States, but congressional representatives ultimately raised tariffs on a host of manufactured goods resulting in average duties as high as 53% on over a thousand various goods. Twenty-five trading partners responded in kind by introducing new tariffs on a wide range of U.S. goods. Hoover was pressured and compelled to adhere to the Republican Party&#x27;s 1928 platform, which sought protective tariffs to alleviate market pressures on the nation&#x27;s struggling agribusinesses and reduce the domestic unemployment rate. The culmination of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression heightened fears, further pressuring Hoover to act on protective policies against the advice of Henry Ford and over 1,000 economists who protested by calling for a veto of the act. Exports from the United States plummeted 60% from 1930 to 1933. Worldwide international trade virtually ground to a halt. The international ramifications of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, comprising protectionist and discriminatory trade policies and bouts of economic nationalism, are credited by economists with prolongment and worldwide propagation of the Great Depression.

====Formal abandonment of the Gold Standard====
The classical gold standard was established in 1821 by the United Kingdom as the Bank of England enabled redemption of its banknotes for gold bullion. France, Germany, the United States, Russia, and Japan each embraced the standard one by one from 1878 to 1897, marking its international acceptance. The first departure from the standard occurred in August 1914 when these nations erected trade embargoes on gold exports and suspended redemption of gold for banknotes. Following the end of World War I on November 11, 1918, Austria, Hungary, Germany, Russia, and Poland began experiencing hyperinflation. Having informally departed from the standard, most currencies were freed from exchange rate fixing and allowed to float. Most countries throughout this period sought to gain national advantages and bolster exports by depreciating their currency values to predatory levels. A number of countries, including the United States, made unenthusiastic and uncoordinated attempts to restore the former gold standard. The early years of the Great Depression brought about bank runs in the United States, Austria, and Germany, which placed pressures on gold reserves in the United Kingdom to such a degree that the gold standard became unsustainable. Germany became the first nation to formally abandon the post-World War I gold standard when the Dresdner Bank implemented foreign exchange controls and announced bankruptcy on July 15, 1931. In September 1931, the United Kingdom allowed the pound sterling to float freely. By the end of 1931, a host of countries including Austria, Canada, Japan, and Sweden abandoned gold. Following widespread bank failures and a hemorrhaging of gold reserves, the United States broke free of the gold standard in April 1933. France would not follow suit until 1936 as investors fled from the franc due to political concerns over Prime Minister Léon Blum&#x27;s government.

====Trade liberalization in the United States====
The disastrous effects of the Smoot–Hawley tariff proved difficult for Herbert Hoover&#x27;s 1932 re-election campaign. Franklin D. Roosevelt became the 32nd U.S. president and the Democratic Party worked to reverse trade protectionism in favor of trade liberalization. As an alternative to cutting tariffs across all imports, Democrats advocated for trade reciprocity. The U.S. Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934, aimed at restoring global trade and reducing unemployment. The legislation expressly authorized President Roosevelt to negotiate bilateral trade agreements and reduce tariffs considerably. If a country agreed to cut tariffs on certain commodities, the U.S. would institute corresponding cuts to promote trade between the two nations. Between 1934 and 1947, the U.S. negotiated 29 such agreements and the average tariff rate decreased by approximately one third during this same period. The legislation contained an important most-favored-nation clause, through which tariffs were equalized to all countries, such that trade agreements would not result in preferential or discriminatory tariff rates with certain countries on any particular import, due to the difficulties and inefficiencies associated with differential tariff rates. The clause effectively generalized tariff reductions from bilateral trade agreements, ultimately reducing worldwide tariff rates.

===Rise of the Bretton Woods financial order: 1945===
As the inception of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, now commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods conference. Delegates remained cognizant of the effects of the Great Depression, struggles to sustain the international gold standard during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous discourse on the international monetary system focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates, Bretton Woods delegates favored pegged exchange rates for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at US$35 per ounce. This arrangement is commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their exchange rates to fluctuate within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar. 

Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequilibria in the balance of payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via fiscal and monetary policy tools before resorting to repegging strategies. The adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment. This feature grew from delegates&#x27; experiences in the 1930s when excessively volatile exchange rates and the reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the deflationary effects of the Great Depression. Capital mobility faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs.

An important component of the Bretton Woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. 

Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone in the evolution of the international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following World War II. Since the establishment of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the World Bank. While the IBRD lends to middle-income developing countries, the IDA extends the Bank&#x27;s lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the world&#x27;s poorest nations.

====General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade: 1947====
In 1947, 23 countries concluded the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at a UN conference in Geneva. Delegates intended the agreement to suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a UN body to be known as the International Trade Organization (ITO). As the ITO never became ratified, GATT became the &quot;de facto&quot; framework for later multilateral trade negotiations. Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains. The agreement&#x27;s structure enabled its signatories to codify and enforce regulations for trading of goods and services. GATT was centered on two precepts: trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and subsidizing non-agricultural exports needed to be prohibited. As such, the agreement&#x27;s most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering preferential tariff rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members. In the event of any discovery of non-agricultural subsidies, members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs. The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures. However, GATT&#x27;s principles did not extend to financial activity, consistent with the era&#x27;s rigid discouragement of capital movements. The agreement&#x27;s initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs. While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third, other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions.

===Resurgence of financial globalization===

====Flexible exchange rate regimes: 1973–present====

Although the exchange rate stability sustained by the Bretton Woods system facilitated expanding international trade, this early success masked its underlying design flaw, wherein there existed no mechanism for increasing the supply of international reserves to support continued growth in trade. The system began experiencing insurmountable market pressures and deteriorating cohesion among its key participants in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Central banks needed more U.S. dollars to hold as reserves, but were unable to expand their money supplies if doing so meant exceeding their dollar reserves and threatening their exchange rate pegs. To accommodate these needs, the Bretton Woods system depended on the United States to run dollar deficits. As a consequence, the dollar&#x27;s value began exceeding its gold backing. During the early 1960s, investors could sell gold for a greater dollar exchange rate in London than in the United States, signaling to market participants that the dollar was overvalued. Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin defined this problem now known as the Triffin dilemma, in which a country&#x27;s national economic interests conflict with its international objectives as the custodian of the world&#x27;s reserve currency.

France voiced concerns over the artificially low price of gold in 1968 and called for returns to the former gold standard. Meanwhile, excess dollars flowed into international markets as the United States expanded its money supply to accommodate the costs of its military campaign in the Vietnam War. Its gold reserves were assaulted by speculative investors following its first current account deficit since the 19th century. In August 1971, President Richard Nixon suspended the exchange of U.S. dollars for gold as part of the Nixon Shock. The closure of the gold window effectively shifted the adjustment burdens of a devalued dollar to other nations. Speculative traders chased other currencies and began selling dollars in anticipation of these currencies being revalued against the dollar. These influxes of capital presented difficulties to foreign central banks, which then faced choosing among inflationary money supplies, largely ineffective capital controls, or floating exchange rates. Following these woes surrounding the U.S. dollar, the dollar price of gold was raised to US$38 per ounce and the Bretton Woods system was modified to allow fluctuations within an augmented band of 2.25% as part of the Smithsonian Agreement signed by the G-10 members in December 1971. The agreement delayed the system&#x27;s demise for a further two years. The system&#x27;s erosion was expedited not only by the dollar devaluations that occurred, but also by the oil crises of the 1970s which emphasized the importance of international financial markets in petrodollar recycling and balance of payments financing. Once the world&#x27;s reserve currency began to float, other nations began adopting floating exchange rate regimes.

=====Post-Bretton Woods financial order: 1976=====
As part of the first amendment to its articles of agreement in 1969, the IMF developed a new reserve instrument called special drawing rights (SDRs), which could be held by central banks and exchanged among themselves and the Fund as an alternative to gold. SDRs entered service in 1970 originally as units of a market basket of sixteen major vehicle currencies of countries whose share of total world exports exceeded 1%. The basket&#x27;s composition changed over time and presently consists of the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and British pound. Beyond holding them as reserves, nations can denominate transactions among themselves and the Fund in SDRs, although the instrument is not a vehicle for trade. In international transactions, the currency basket&#x27;s portfolio characteristic affords greater stability against the uncertainties inherent with free floating exchange rates. Special drawing rights were originally equivalent to a specified amount of gold, but were not directly redeemable for gold and instead served as a surrogate in obtaining other currencies that could be exchanged for gold. The Fund initially issued 9.5 billion XDR from 1970 to 1972.

IMF members signed the Jamaica Agreement in January 1976, which ratified the end of the Bretton Woods system and reoriented the Fund&#x27;s role in supporting the international monetary system. The agreement officially embraced the flexible exchange rate regimes that emerged after the failure of the Smithsonian Agreement measures. In tandem with floating exchange rates, the agreement endorsed central bank interventions aimed at clearing excessive volatility. The agreement retroactively formalized the abandonment of gold as a reserve instrument and the Fund subsequently demonetized its gold reserves, returning gold to members or selling it to provide poorer nations with relief funding. Developing countries and countries not endowed with oil export resources enjoyed greater access to IMF lending programs as a result. The Fund continued assisting nations experiencing balance of payments deficits and currency crises, but began imposing conditionality on its funding that required countries to adopt policies aimed at reducing deficits through spending cuts and tax increases, reducing protective trade barriers, and contractionary monetary policy.

The second amendment to the articles of agreement was signed in 1978. It legally formalized the free-floating acceptance and gold demonetization achieved by the Jamaica Agreement, and required members to support stable exchange rates through macroeconomic policy. The post-Bretton Woods system was decentralized in that member states retained autonomy in selecting an exchange rate regime. The amendment also expanded the institution&#x27;s capacity for oversight and charged members with supporting monetary sustainability by cooperating with the Fund on regime implementation. This role is called IMF surveillance and is recognized as a pivotal point in the evolution of the Fund&#x27;s mandate, which was extended beyond balance of payments issues to broader concern with internal and external stresses on countries&#x27; overall economic policies.

Under the dominance of flexible exchange rate regimes, the foreign exchange markets became significantly more volatile. In 1980, newly elected U.S. president Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits. To finance these deficits, the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital. As foreign investors&#x27; demand for U.S. dollars grew, the dollar&#x27;s value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985. The U.S. trade deficit grew to $160 billion in 1985 ($341 billion in 2012 dollars) as a result of the dollar&#x27;s strong appreciation. The G5 met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States&#x27; trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions, in what became known as the Plaza Accord. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate, but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase. To address these concerns, the G7 (now G8) held a summit in Paris in 1987, where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies, in what became known as the Louvre Accord. This accord became the provenance of the managed float regime by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies. Exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the 1990s, with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during the Dot-com bubble. After the 2000 stock market correction of the Dot-com bubble the country&#x27;s trade deficit grew, the September 11 attacks increased political uncertainties, and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001.

=====European Monetary System: 1979=====

Following the Smithsonian Agreement, member states of the European Economic Community adopted a narrower currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the &quot;snake in the tunnel&quot;. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members&#x27; currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies&#x27; par values. 

The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU&#x27;s value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems&#x27; initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.

====Birth of the World Trade Organization: 1994====
The Uruguay Round of GATT multilateral trade negotiations took place from 1986 to 1994, with 123 nations becoming party to agreements achieved throughout the negotiations. Among the achievements were trade liberalization in agricultural goods and textiles, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and agreements on intellectual property rights issues. The key manifestation of this round was the Marrakech Agreement signed in April 1994, which established the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO is a chartered multilateral trade organization, charged with continuing the GATT mandate to promote trade, govern trade relations, and prevent damaging trade practices or policies. It became operational in January 1995. Compared with its GATT secretariat predecessor, the WTO features an improved mechanism for settling trade disputes since the organization is membership-based and not dependent on consensus as in traditional trade negotiations. This function was designed to address prior weaknesses, whereby parties in dispute would invoke delays, obstruct negotiations, or fall back on weak enforcement. In 1997, WTO members reached an agreement which committed to softer restrictions on commercial financial services, including banking services, securities trading, and insurance services. These commitments entered into force in March 1999, consisting of 70 governments accounting for approximately 95% of worldwide financial services.

===Financial integration and systemic crises: 1980–present===


Financial integration among industrialized nations grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered benefits such as greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure to the public and to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. 

The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian financial crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation&#x27;s fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation&#x27;s currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.

Following research of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists have reached a consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency in the eyes of both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.

Countries sought to improve the sustainability and transparency of the global financial system in response to crises in the 1980s and 1990s. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was formed in 1974 by the G-10 members&#x27; central bank governors to facilitate cooperation on the supervision and regulation of banking practices. It is headquartered at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The committee has held several rounds of deliberation known collectively as the Basel Accords. The first of these accords, known as Basel I, took place in 1988 and emphasized credit risk and the assessment of different asset classes. Basel I was motivated by concerns over whether large multinational banks were appropriately regulated, stemming from observations during the 1980s Latin American debt crisis. Following Basel I, the committee published recommendations on new capital requirements for banks, which the G-10 nations implemented four years later. In 1999, the G-10 established the Financial Stability Forum (reconstituted by the G-20 in 2009 as the Financial Stability Board) to facilitate cooperation among regulatory agencies and promote stability in the global financial system. The Forum was charged with developing and codifying twelve international standards and implementation thereof. 

The Basel II accord was set in 2004 and again emphasized capital requirements as a safeguard against systemic risk as well as the need for global consistency in banking regulations so as not to competitively disadvantage banks operating internationally. It was motivated by what were seen as inadequacies of the first accord such as insufficient public disclosure of banks&#x27; risk profiles and oversight by regulatory bodies. Members were slow to implement it, with major efforts by the European Union and United States taking place as late as 2007 and 2008. In 2010, the Basel Committee revised the capital requirements in a set of enhancements to Basel II known as Basel III, which centered on a leverage ratio requirement aimed at restricting excessive leveraging by banks. In addition to strengthening the ratio, Basel III modified the formulas used to weight risk and compute the capital thresholds necessary to mitigate the risks of bank holdings, concluding the capital threshold should be set at 7% of the value of a bank&#x27;s risk-weighted assets.

====Birth of the European Economic and Monetary Union 1992====
In February 1992, European Union countries signed the Maastricht Treaty which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The first stage centered on liberalizing capital mobility and aligning macroeconomic policies between countries. The second stage established the European Monetary Institute which was ultimately dissolved in tandem with the establishment in 1998 of the European Central Bank (ECB) and European System of Central Banks. Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of convergence criteria that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. The third and final stage introduced a common currency for circulation known as the Euro, adopted by eleven of then-fifteen members of the European Union in January 1999. In doing so, they disaggregated their sovereignty in matters of monetary policy. These countries continued to circulate their national legal tenders, exchangeable for euros at fixed rates, until 2002 when the ECB began issuing official Euro coins and notes. , the EMU comprises 17 nations which have issued the Euro, and 11 non-Euro states.

====2008 financial crisis====

Following the market turbulence of the 1990s financial crises and September 11 attacks on the U.S. in 2001, financial integration intensified among developed nations and emerging markets, with substantial growth in capital flows among banks and in the trading of financial derivatives and structured finance products. Worldwide international capital flows grew from $3 trillion to $11 trillion U.S. dollars from 2002 to 2007, primarily in the form of short-term money market instruments. The United States experienced growth in the size and complexity of firms engaged in a broad range of financial services across borders in the wake of the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 which repealed the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, ending limitations on commercial banks&#x27; investment banking activity. Industrialized nations began relying more on foreign capital to finance domestic investment opportunities, resulting in unprecedented capital flows to advanced economies from developing countries, as reflected by global imbalances which grew to 6% of gross world product in 2007 from 3% in 2001.

The 2008 financial crisis shared some of the key features exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, herd behavior during investment bubbles, collapsing asset prices, and massive deleveraging. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations. Similarly to the 1997 Asian crisis, the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries. Particularly in the United States, the crisis was characterized by growing securitization of non-performing assets, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the housing sector. While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the 2008 financial crisis, the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the crisis became a precursor for the Great Recession. In the wake of the crisis, total volume of world trade in goods and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. The 2008 financial crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration, sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether.

====Eurozone crisis====

In 2009, a newly elected government in Greece revealed the falsification of its national budget data, and that its fiscal deficit for the year was 12.7% of GDP as opposed to the 3.7% espoused by the previous administration. This news alerted markets to the fact that Greece&#x27;s deficit exceeded the eurozone&#x27;s maximum of 3% outlined in the Economic and Monetary Union&#x27;s Stability and Growth Pact. Investors concerned about a possible sovereign default rapidly sold Greek bonds. Given Greece&#x27;s prior decision to embrace the euro as its currency, it no longer held monetary policy autonomy and could not intervene to depreciate a national currency to absorb the shock and boost competitiveness, as was the traditional solution to sudden capital flight. The crisis proved contagious when it spread to Portugal, Italy, and Spain (together with Greece these are collectively referred to as the PIGS). Ratings agencies downgraded these countries&#x27; debt instruments in 2010 which further increased the costliness of refinancing or repaying their national debts. The crisis continued to spread and soon grew into a European sovereign debt crisis which threatened economic recovery in the wake of the Great Recession. In tandem with the IMF, the European Union members assembled a €750 billion bailout for Greece and other afflicted nations. Additionally, the ECB pledged to purchase bonds from troubled eurozone nations in an effort to mitigate the risk of a banking system panic. The crisis is recognized by economists as highlighting the depth of financial integration in Europe, contrasted with the lack of fiscal integration and political unification necessary to prevent or decisively respond to crises. During the initial waves of the crisis, the public speculated that the turmoil could result in a disintegration of the eurozone and an abandonment of the euro. German Federal Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble called for the expulsion of offending countries from the eurozone. Now commonly referred to as the Eurozone crisis, it has been ongoing since 2009 and most recently began encompassing the 2012–2013 Cypriot financial crisis.

==Implications of globalized capital==

===Balance of payments===
The balance of payments accounts summarize payments made to or received from foreign countries. Receipts are considered credit transactions while payments are considered debit transactions. The balance of payments is a function of three components: transactions involving export or import of goods and services form the current account, transactions involving purchase or sale of financial assets form the financial account, and transactions involving unconventional transfers of wealth form the capital account. The current account summarizes three variables: the trade balance, net factor income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers. The financial account summarizes the value of exports versus imports of assets, and the capital account summarizes the value of asset transfers received net of transfers given. The capital account also includes the official reserve account, which summarizes central banks&#x27; purchases and sales of domestic currency, foreign exchange, gold, and SDRs for purposes of maintaining or utilizing bank reserves.

Because the balance of payments sums to zero, a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates the extent to which a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country&#x27;s debt. From this perspective, the balance of payments links a nation&#x27;s income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation&#x27;s wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.

A country&#x27;s external wealth is measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation&#x27;s external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).

===Unique financial risks===

Nations and international businesses face an array of financial risks unique to foreign investment activity. Political risk is the potential for losses from a foreign country&#x27;s political instability or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country&#x27;s capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country&#x27;s regulatory policies and their impact on normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments. Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to expropriate or nationalize foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor&#x27;s decision to acquire assets in the host country. Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.

==Participants==

===Economic actors===

Each of the core economic functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import foreign goods or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy. International financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad. Consumers, multinational corporations, individual and institutional investors, and financial intermediaries (such as banks) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the European Central Bank or the U.S. Federal Reserve System) undertake open market operations in their efforts to realize monetary policy goals. International financial institutions such as the Bretton Woods institutions, multilateral development banks and other development finance institutions provide emergency financing to countries in crisis, provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives. Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, Institute of International Finance, and the World Federation of Exchanges attempt to ease trade, facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs, promote standards, and sponsor research and statistics publications.

===Regulatory bodies===

Explicit goals of financial regulation include countries&#x27; pursuits of financial stability and the safeguarding of unsophisticated market players from fraudulent activity, while implicit goals include offering viable and competitive financial environments to world investors. A single nation with functioning governance, financial regulations, deposit insurance, emergency financing through discount windows, standard accounting practices, and established legal and disclosure procedures, can itself develop and grow a healthy domestic financial system. In a global context however, no central political authority exists which can extend these arrangements globally. Rather, governments have cooperated to establish a host of institutions and practices that have evolved over time and are referred to collectively as the international financial architecture. Within this architecture, regulatory authorities such as national governments and intergovernmental organizations have the capacity to influence international financial markets. National governments may employ their finance ministries, treasuries, and regulatory agencies to impose tariffs and foreign capital controls or may use their central banks to execute a desired intervention in the open markets.

Some degree of self-regulation occurs whereby banks and other financial institutions attempt to operate within guidelines set and published by multilateral organizations such as the International Monetary Fund or the Bank for International Settlements (particularly the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Committee on the Global Financial System). Further examples of international regulatory bodies are: the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established to coordinate information and activities among developed countries; the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) which coordinates the regulation of financial securities; the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) which promotes consistent insurance industry supervision; the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering which facilitates collaboration in battling money laundering and terrorism financing; and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which publishes accounting and auditing standards. Public and private arrangements exist to assist and guide countries struggling with sovereign debt payments, such as the Paris Club and London Club. National securities commissions and independent financial regulators maintain oversight of their industries&#x27; foreign exchange market activities. Two examples of supranational financial regulators in Europe are the European Banking Authority (EBA) which identifies systemic risks and institutional weaknesses and may overrule national regulators, and the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (ESFRC) which reviews financial regulatory issues and publishes policy recommendations.

===Research organizations and other fora===
Research and academic institutions, professional associations, and think-tanks aim to observe, model, understand, and publish recommendations to improve the transparency and effectiveness of the global financial system. For example, the independent non-partisan World Economic Forum facilitates the Global Agenda Council on the Global Financial System and Global Agenda Council on the International Monetary System, which report on systemic risks and assemble policy recommendations. The Global Financial Markets Association facilitates discussion of global financial issues among members of various professional associations around the world. The Group of Thirty (G30) formed in 1978 as a private, international group of consultants, researchers, and representatives committed to advancing understanding of international economics and global finance.

==Future of the global financial system==
The IMF has reported that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States&#x27; disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy. Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors&#x27; expectations of a new monetary regime with higher interest rates. Interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from higher interest rates and greater volatility, or by structural deleveraging in short-term securities and in the shadow banking system (particularly the mortgage market and real estate investment trusts). Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone&#x27;s nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments. Policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth so as not to provoke investor withdrawal.

The 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession prompted renewed discourse on the architecture of the global financial system. These events called to attention financial integration, inadequacies of global governance, and the emergent systemic risks of financial globalization. Since the establishment in 1945 of a formal international monetary system with the IMF empowered as its guardian, the world has undergone extensive changes politically and economically. This has fundamentally altered the paradigm in which international financial institutions operate, increasing the complexities of the IMF and World Bank&#x27;s mandates. The lack of adherence to a formal monetary system has created a void of global constraints on national macroeconomic policies and a deficit of rule-based governance of financial activities. French economist and Executive Director of the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee, Marc Uzan, has pointed out that some radical proposals such as a &quot;global central bank or a world financial authority&quot; have been deemed impractical, leading to further consideration of medium-term efforts to improve transparency and disclosure, strengthen emerging market financial climates, bolster prudential regulatory environments in advanced nations, and better moderate capital account liberalization and exchange rate regime selection in emerging markets. He has also drawn attention to calls for increased participation from the private sector in the management of financial crises and the augmenting of multilateral institutions&#x27; resources.

The Council on Foreign Relations&#x27; assessment of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, are the two key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded before and after the 2008 financial crisis to the extent that the United States&#x27; status as the steward of the world&#x27;s reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world&#x27;s ability to prevent future financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board&#x27;s capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.

===Reform efforts===
Former World Bank Chief Economist and former chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Joseph Stiglitz referred in the late 1990s to a growing consensus that something is wrong with a system having the capacity to impose high costs on a great number of people who are hardly even participants in international financial markets, neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in foreign currencies. He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of moral hazard, particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries, and the high costs damage standards of living. Stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing short-term international capital flows without adversely affecting long-term foreign direct investment which usually carries new knowledge spillover and technological advancements into economies.

American economist and former chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker has argued that the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.

Governor of the Bank of England and former governor of the Bank of Canada Mark Carney has described two approaches to global financial reform: shielding financial institutions from cyclic economic effects by strengthening banks individually, and defending economic cycles from banks by improving systemic resiliency. Strengthening financial institutions necessitates stronger capital requirements and liquidity provisions, as well as better measurement and management of risks. The G-20 agreed to new standards presented by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at its 2009 summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The standards included leverage ratio targets to supplement other capital adequacy requirements established by Basel II. Improving the resiliency of the global financial system requires protections that enable the system to withstand singular institutional and market failures. Carney has argued that policymakers have converged on the view that institutions must bear the burden of financial losses during future financial crises, and such occurrences should be well-defined and pre-planned. He suggested other national regulators follow Canada in establishing staged intervention procedures and require banks to commit to what he termed &quot;living wills&quot; which would detail plans for an orderly institutional failure.

At its 2010 summit in Seoul, South Korea, the G-20 collectively endorsed a new collection of capital adequacy and liquidity standards for banks recommended by Basel III. Andreas Dombret of the Executive Board of Deutsche Bundesbank has noted a difficulty in identifying institutions that constitute systemic importance via their size, complexity, and degree of interconnectivity within the global financial system, and that efforts should be made to identify a group of 25 to 30 indisputable globally systemic institutions. He has suggested they be held to standards higher than those mandated by Basel III, and that despite the inevitability of institutional failures, such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate. Dombret has advocated for regulatory reform that extends beyond banking regulations and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public disclosure and increased regulation of the shadow banking system.

President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Vice Chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee William C. Dudley has argued that a global financial system regulated on a largely national basis is untenable for supporting a world economy with global financial firms. In 2011, he advocated five pathways to improving the safety and security of the global financial system: a special capital requirement for financial institutions deemed systemically important; a level playing field which discourages exploitation of disparate regulatory environments and beggar thy neighbour policies that serve &quot;national constituencies at the expense of global financial stability&quot;; superior cooperation among regional and national regulatory regimes with broader protocols for sharing information such as records for the trade of over-the-counter financial derivatives; improved delineation of &quot;the responsibilities of the home versus the host country&quot; when banks encounter trouble; and well-defined procedures for managing emergency liquidity solutions across borders including which parties are responsible for the risk, terms, and funding of such measures.

<text>William Bartlett Peet (&quot;né&quot; Peed; January 29, 1915 – May 11, 2002) was an American children&#x27;s book illustrator and a story writer and animator for Walt Disney Animation Studios.

Peet joined Disney in 1937 and worked first on &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937) near the end of its production. Progressively, his involvement in the Disney studio&#x27;s animated feature films and shorts increased, and he remained there until early in the development of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967). A row with Walt Disney over the direction of the project led to a permanent personal break.

Peet&#x27;s subsequent career was as a writer and illustrator of numerous children&#x27;s books, including &quot;Capyboppy&quot; (1966), &quot;The Wump World&quot; (1970), &quot;The Whingdingdilly&quot; (1970), &quot;The Ant and the Elephant&quot; (1972), and &quot;Cyrus the Unsinkable Serpent&quot; (1975).

==Early life==
Bill Peet was born in Grandview, Indiana, on January 29, 1915. He developed a love of drawing at an early age and filled tablets with sketches.

According to his autobiography, Peet&#x27;s happiest childhood times were the years following World War I - years during which his father abandoned the family. During that period Peet lived with his mother and brothers on the outskirts of Indianapolis, in a household run by his maternal grandmother.

Animals were always a love of Peet&#x27;s. He and his friends traipsed through the woods looking for frogs, tadpoles, and minnows. Most of his adventures as a boy to catch animals were in the hope that he could capture them and sketch them. These years laid the groundwork for two primary themes repeated in his books: unkindness in the animal kingdom and the grim costs of human progress. &quot;It has always been difficult for me to accept nature&#x27;s cruel ways of keeping a balance among the animals - all the savagery and suffering,&quot; he wrote about the frogs and snakes he chased in his local creek. &quot;Yet nature&#x27;s merciless ways were never more cruel than the slow, silent death caused by the poisonous waste spilling from pipes down into the creek... where dead fish floated belly up and a nauseating stench filled the air.&quot;

Often, instead of doing lessons, Peet drew in the margins of his textbooks, which were very popular for their added illustrations when he sold them back.

The young Peet also sneaked into greeting parties at the train station, just for the chance to see the train&#x27;s mechanical workings close-up. As a teen, he tried to sketch the circus big top, but he was always in the way of the set-up crew. He memorized the scene and later reconstructed it from memory.

After ten years of absence, Peet&#x27;s father returned to the household and, according to Peet, brought with him conflict and strife - demanding that Peet&#x27;s mother provide money to underwrite a string of failed ventures as a traveling salesman. This chapter culminated in the death of Peet&#x27;s grandmother, which Peet implied was in part caused by the stress and misery his father caused. The home where the family lived was sold, and Peet&#x27;s blissful young years ended.

It was about this time Peet entered into Arsenal Technical High School. At first, he had little interest in pursuing a career as an artist. However, after failing all his classes but physical education, he followed the advice of a friend and took some art classes. Peet did extremely well and experimented with a broad range of media. He eventually received a scholarship to the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, which he attended for three years. In the first class, Bill found himself very interested in a girl who sat in the front row. That girl, Margaret Brunst, became his wife in 1937.

Peet took quite a few painting classes that first year, and he admitted his paintings were always somewhat macabre. &quot;I seemed to be attracted to the gloomy side of things, or the sordid,&quot; he wrote. &quot;No vases of flowers or water lilies for me.&quot; His favorite subjects were grizzled old men, “perfected with age, like a gnarled oak tree.” Another favorite subject was the circus—but always the assembly of the tent cities, never the show itself.

==Disney==
Following college, Peet sent off some of his cartoon action sketches after hearing that the Disney Studio was hiring artists for their animated films. He was subsequently asked to come to try-outs. He trekked across the country to Los Angeles and participated in a one-month audition process; only three of fifteen survived the tryouts, and they were rewarded with work as &quot;in-betweeners&quot; (making up the frames between the key drawings) on the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; shorts. He found the work somewhat tedious. It was at this time Disney was working on &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, which Hollywood skeptics predicted would be a failure. After &quot;Snow White&quot; had become a triumphant success, Peet sent character sketches for &quot;Pinocchio&quot; to Disney&#x27;s production team. Before the verdict on his designs had come back, Peet felt like he&#x27;d had enough, and he went screaming out of the studio, “No more ducks!” Fortuitously, he came back the next day to pick up his jacket and found an envelope, informing him he had been promoted to the story department, where he went on to contribute to films including &quot;Fantasia&quot;, &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;Song of the South&quot;, and &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.

Peet then officially began working as a sketch artist, putting the words of a story man into pictures on the film. Peet&#x27;s first encounter with Walt Disney directly was at this time, when Disney reviewed the storyboards Peet had put together. Even though both his boards were eventually cut from the film, Peet continued to work on &quot;Pinocchio&quot; for another year and a half. After that period, Peet worked on &quot;Fantasia&quot; and &quot;Dumbo&quot;. When World War II broke out, Disney halted normal production and contributed to the war effort making propaganda films. Peet helped here as well but received his big break after the war was over. His work was so impressive to Walt that he made him a fully fledged story man who also handled the sketching end of character design. He was also the sole developer of the animated features &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; and &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, the only artist to have created all of the storyboards for a Disney animated movie.

As Peet began to consider a backup profession in the 1950s, he decided to continue working at Disney where he developed a few short cartoons and worked on the feature films of the period. At this point, he was working very closely with Walt Disney; Peet respected Disney&#x27;s creative genius but found him to be a sometimes difficult man. A large part of his autobiography is dedicated to his dealings with Disney over the years. Peet described the Disney studio as a &quot;brutal&quot; place, rife with rivalries and jealousy.

Although Walt Disney himself had not animated on his films since the earliest days of the studio, and by the 1950s was less present on a day to day basis when it came to the planning of the animated films, he still remained in charge of the major decisions on the artistic side. He reviewed all the work and gave it the final go-ahead. As they were both strong-willed and passionately creative men, Peet and Disney quarreled frequently about parts in the films such as the dancing/romance scene in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. Peet quit working with Disney and left the company on January 29, 1964, which was his 49th birthday, following an especially heated argument with Walt concerning the relative tone and direction of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; which included Walt insulting Peet stating he should see &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; for &quot;real entertainment&quot;. Peet would later admit in his autobiography that he was glad he didn&#x27;t insult back at Disney over the film and left the studio when he did knowing that Disney would die two years after he left.

==Children&#x27;s books==
While he was still working at Disney, Peet realized by 1950 that he wouldn&#x27;t stay at the studio forever and began to consider a backup profession which included returning to painting as well as trying to make editorial cartoons for magazines. However, he abandoned both as he felt he had &quot;lost touch with the brush&quot; due to the ever-changing art landscape and his editorial cartoons were rejected by several publications. He then turned his attention to writing and illustrating children&#x27;s books which he had considered doing as a career when he was a kid. Peet developed many of his ideas from bedtime stories he had told his children and he wrote and illustrated several books while still at Disney with his first book, &quot;Hubert’s Hair-Raising Adventure&quot;, being published in 1959, although some of his stories he had planned were turned into shorts at the studio. After leaving the studio in 1964, Peet turned his full attention to writing children&#x27;s books. Much of the success Peet&#x27;s stories have enjoyed is due to the memorable themes they contain: trying when there&#x27;s not much obvious hope, not allowing taunting of others to prevent individual success, finding compromise in solutions and others. Unlike most other children&#x27;s authors, Peet did not dumb down the vocabulary of his stories but included enough context to make the meaning of difficult words obvious. All of his books published by Houghton Mifflin Company remain actively in print.

==Death and legacy==
Peet died on May 11, 2002, at the age of 87. His interment was at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

In 2015, Walt Disney Animation Studios produced a cartoon short for the &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; Diamond Edition Blu-ray release entitled &quot;The Further Adventures of Thunderbolt&quot; as a bonus feature, based on Peet&#x27;s early drafts of the &quot;Thunderbolt the Wonder Dog&quot; sequence which follows the events after Thunderbolt and Dirty Dawson start fighting in the river.

Justin Marks, who wrote the screenplay for Disney&#x27;s 2016 live-action &quot;Jungle Book&quot; film directed by Jon Favreau, had commented that he plans to incorporate elements from Peet&#x27;s rejected screenplay of the original animated classic into the former film&#x27;s upcoming sequel:

<doc id="244081" wikidata="Q1240901" url="?curid=244081" title="Praenomen">
<text>The praenomen (; plural: praenomina) was a first name chosen by the parents of a Roman child. It was first bestowed on the &quot;dies lustricus&quot; (day of lustration), the eighth day after the birth of a girl, or the ninth day after the birth of a boy. The praenomen would then be formally conferred a second time when girls married, or when boys assumed the &quot;toga virilis&quot; upon reaching manhood. Although it was the oldest of the &quot;tria nomina&quot; commonly used in Roman naming conventions, by the late republic, most praenomina were so common that most people were called by their praenomina only by family or close friends. For this reason, although they continued to be used, praenomina gradually disappeared from public records during imperial times. Although both men and women received praenomina, women&#x27;s praenomina were frequently ignored, and they were gradually abandoned by many Roman families, though they continued to be used in some families and in the countryside.

==Background==
The &quot;tria nomina&quot;, consisting of praenomen, nomen and cognomen, which are today regarded as a distinguishing feature of Roman culture, first developed and spread throughout Italy in pre-Roman times. Most of the people of Italy spoke languages belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European language family; the three major groups within the Italian peninsula were the Latino-Faliscan languages, including the tribes of the Latini, or Latins, who formed the core of the early Roman populace, and their neighbors, the Falisci and Hernici; the Oscan languages, including the Sabines, who also contributed to early Roman culture, as well as the Samnites, and many other peoples of central and southern Italy; and the Umbrian languages, spoken by the Umbri of the Central Apennines, the rustic Picentes of the Adriatic coast, and the Volsci.

In addition to the Italic peoples was the Etruscan civilization, whose language was unrelated to Indo-European, but who exerted a strong cultural influence throughout much of Italy, including early Rome.

The Italic nomenclature system cannot clearly be attributed to any one of these cultures, but seems to have developed simultaneously amongst each of them, perhaps due to constant contact between them. It first appears in urban centers and thence gradually spread to the countryside. In the earliest period, each person was known by a single name, or nomen. These nomina were &quot;monothematic&quot;; that is, they expressed a single concept or idea. As populations grew, many individuals might be known by the same name. Unlike the other cultures of Europe, which dealt with this problem by adopting &quot;dithematic&quot; names (names expressing two ideas), the peoples of Italy developed the first true surnames, or cognomina.

At first these were generally personal names, and might refer to any number of things, including a person&#x27;s occupation, town of origin, the name of his or her father, or some physical feature or characteristic. But gradually an increasing number of them became hereditary, until they could be used to distinguish whole families from one generation to another. As this happened, the word nomen came to be applied to these surnames, and the original personal name came to be called the praenomen, or &quot;forename&quot;, as it was usually recited first. Cognomen came to refer to any other personal or hereditary surnames coming after the family name, and used to distinguish individuals or branches of large families from one another.

As the &quot;tria nomina&quot; developed throughout Italy, the importance of the praenomen in everyday life declined considerably, together with the number of praenomina in common use. By the first century they were occasionally omitted from public records, and by the middle of the fourth century they were seldom recorded. As the Roman Empire expanded, much of the populace came from cultures with different naming conventions, and the formal structure of the &quot;tria nomina&quot; became neglected. Various names that were originally nomina or cognomina came to be treated as praenomina, and some individuals used several of them at once. However, some vestiges of the original system survived, and many of the original praenomina have continued into modern times.

Most common praenomina were regularly abbreviated in writing (in speech the full name would always be used). Although some names could be abbreviated multiple ways, the following tables include only the most usual abbreviation, if any, for each name. These abbreviations continue to be used by classical scholars.

==Latin praenomina==
Each of the Italic peoples had its own distinctive group of praenomina. A few names were shared between cultures, and the Etruscans in particular borrowed many praenomina from Latin and Oscan. It is disputed whether some of the praenomina used by the Romans themselves were of distinctly Etruscan or Oscan origin. However, these names were in general use at Rome and other Latin towns, and were used by families that were certainly of Latin origin. Thus, irrespective of their actual etymology, these names may be regarded as Latin.

===Masculine names===
In the early centuries of the Roman Republic, about three dozen praenomina seem to have been in general use at Rome, of which about half were common. This number gradually dwindled to about eighteen praenomina by the first century BC, of which perhaps a dozen were common.
* Agrippa (Agr.)
* Appius (Ap.)
* Aulus (A.)
* Caeso (K.)
* Decimus (D.)
* Faustus (F.)
* Gaius (C.)
* Gnaeus (Cn.)
* Hostus
* Lucius (L.)
* Mamercus (Mam.)
* Manius (ꟿ. or M&#x27;.)
* Marcus (M.)
* Mettius
* Nonus
* Numerius (N.)
* Octavius (Oct.)
* Opiter (Opet.)
* Paullus
* Postumus (Post.)
* Proculus (Pro.)
* Publius (P.)
* Quintus (Q.)
* Septimus
* Sertor (Sert.)
* Servius (Ser.)
* Sextus (Sex.)
* Spurius (S.)
* Statius (St.)
* Tiberius (Ti.)
* Titus (T.)
* Tullus
* Vibius (V.)
* Volesus (Vol.)
* Vopiscus (Vop.)
Notes:

* &quot;Caeso&quot; is frequently (especially in older records) spelled &quot;Kaeso&quot;. The abbreviation K. was retained to distinguish the name from &quot;Gaius&quot;, abbreviated &quot;C.&quot;
* &quot;Gaius&quot; and &quot;Gnaeus&quot; are abbreviated with C. and Cn., respectively, because the practice of abbreviating them was already established at the time the letter G, a modified C, was introduced to the Latin alphabet. Although the archaic spellings &quot;Caius&quot; and &quot;Cnaeus&quot; also appear in later records, &quot;Gaius&quot; and &quot;Gnaeus&quot; represent the actual pronunciation of these names.
* &quot;Manius&quot; was originally abbreviated with an archaic five-stroke M (ꟿ), borrowed from the Etruscan alphabet (from which the Latin alphabet was derived) but not otherwise used in Latin. The apostrophe is used as a substitute for this letter.
* &quot;Octavius&quot; (with an i) seems to be the only form of this name found as a praenomen, although the form &quot;Octavus&quot; would be consistent with the adjective from which the name is derived.
* &quot;Volero&quot;, a praenomen used by the Publilii, is believed to be a variant of &quot;Volesus&quot;.

Some of the praenomina in this list are known from only a few examples. However, the overall sample from which they have been taken represents only a small fraction of the entire Roman populace. The &quot;Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft&quot; mentions about ten thousand individuals whose praenomina are known from surviving works of history, literature, and various inscriptions. These individuals are spread over a period of over twelve centuries, with the smallest sample coming from the early Republic, when the greatest variety of praenomina was in use. During that same period, the sample consists almost entirely of Roman men belonging to the leading patrician families.

Many of the names which were uncommon amongst the patricians appear to have been more widespread amongst the plebeians, and the appearance of rare names in Latin inscriptions outside of Rome suggests that many names which were uncommon at Rome were much more common in other parts of Latium.

===Feminine names===
In the earliest period, both men and women used praenomina. However, with the adoption of hereditary surnames, the praenomen lost much of its original importance. The number of praenomina in general use declined steadily throughout Roman history, and as most families used the same praenomina from one generation to the next, the praenomen became less useful for distinguishing between individuals. Women&#x27;s praenomina gradually fell into disuse, and by the first century the majority of Roman women either did not have or did not use praenomina. A similar process occurred throughout Italy, except amongst the Etruscans, for whom feminine praenomina were the rule.

The abandonment of women&#x27;s praenomina over time was more the result of practical usage than a deliberate process. Because Latin names had both masculine and feminine forms, the nomen itself was sufficient to distinguish a Roman woman from her father and brothers. Roman women did not change their names when they married, so a Roman wife usually did not share her nomen with any other members of her family. Diminutives, nicknames, and personal cognomina could be used to differentiate between sisters. When there were two sisters, they were frequently referred to as &quot;Major&quot; and &quot;Minor&quot;, with these terms appearing after the nomen or cognomen; if there were more than two, the eldest might be called &quot;Maxima&quot;, and the younger sisters assigned numerical cognomina.

Many of the cognomina used by women originated as praenomina, and for much of Roman history there seems to have been a fashion for &quot;inverting&quot; women&#x27;s praenomina and cognomina; names that were traditionally regarded as praenomina were often placed after a woman&#x27;s nomen or cognomen, as if a surname, even though they were used as praenomina. The reverse was also common, especially in imperial times; a personal cognomen would be placed before a woman&#x27;s nomen, in the place of a praenomen. In both cases, the name was functionally a praenomen, irrespective of its position in the name. For this reason, it is often impossible to distinguish between women&#x27;s praenomina and personal cognomina.

In imperial times, Roman women were more likely to have praenomina if they had several older sisters. A daughter who had been called simply by her nomen for several years was less likely to receive a praenomen than her younger sisters, and because it was usually easy to distinguish between two daughters without using praenomina, the need for traditional personal names did not become acute until there were at least three sisters in a family. &quot;Tertia&quot; and &quot;Quarta&quot; were common praenomina, while &quot;Secunda&quot; was less common, and &quot;Prima&quot; rarer still. &quot;Maxima, Maio&quot;, and &quot;Mino&quot; were also used as praenomina, although it may be debated whether they represent true personal names. &quot;Paulla&quot; was probably given to younger daughters, and was one of the most common praenomina.

Most other women&#x27;s praenomina were simply the feminine forms of familiar masculine praenomina. Examples are known of all common praenomina, as well as a number of less-common ones. Only in the case of praenomina which had irregular masculine forms is there some uncertainty; but these probably became feminine by taking diminutive forms. &quot;Caesula&quot; or &quot;Caesilla&quot; appears to have been the feminine form of &quot;Caeso&quot;, and the personal cognomen &quot;Agrippina&quot; probably represents the feminine form of &quot;Agrippa&quot;. Two notable exceptions to the usual formation are &quot;Marcia&quot; and &quot;Titia&quot;, both of which regularly formed as &quot;i-stem&quot; nouns, instead of the expected &quot;Marca&quot; and &quot;Tita&quot; (although those forms are also found).

Feminine praenomina were usually abbreviated in the same manner as their masculine counterparts, but were often written in full. One notable exception occurs in the filiations of &quot;liberti&quot;, where the abbreviation &quot;C.&quot; for &quot;Gaia&quot; was frequently reversed to indicate a woman. Here the name &quot;Gaia&quot; seems to have been used generically to represent any woman, although in some instances an inverted &quot;M.&quot; for &quot;Marcia&quot; seems to have been used as well.

The following list includes feminine praenomina which are known or reasonably certain from extant sources and inscriptions, and which were clearly used as praenomina, rather than nicknames or inverted cognomina. Several variations are known for some praenomina, of which only the most regular are given in this table. The abbreviations are usually the same as for the corresponding masculine praenomina; where variation exists, only the most common abbreviation has been provided. A few of these names were normally written in full, or have not been found with regular abbreviations.

Notes:

* &quot;Maio&quot; and &quot;Mino&quot; are the forms usually found as praenomina, although &quot;Major&quot; and &quot;Minor&quot; are also found. As cognomina, &quot;Major&quot; and &quot;Minor&quot; seem to have been preferred.
* &quot;Secunda&quot; was usually abbreviated &quot;Seq.&quot;, although &quot;Sec.&quot; is also common. In archaic Latin, C was used primarily before E and I, while Q appeared before O and U, and K before A. In a few instances the name is written &quot;Sequnda&quot;.

=== The meaning of praenomina ===
Philologists have debated the origin and meaning of these names since classical antiquity. However, many of the meanings popularly assigned to various praenomina appear to have been no more than &quot;folk etymology&quot;. The names derived from numbers are the most certain. The masculine names Quintus, Sextus, Septimus, Octavius and Decimus, and the feminine names Prima, Secunda, Tertia, Quarta, Quinta, Sexta, Septima, Octavia, Nona and Decima are all based on ordinal numerals. There may also have been a praenomen Nonus, as there was a gens with the apparently patronymic name of Nonius, although no examples of its use as a praenomen have survived.

It has historically been held that these names originally referred to the order of a child&#x27;s birth, but some scholars have argued that they in fact referred to the month of the Roman calendar in which a child was born. Like the masculine praenomina, the months of the old Roman Calendar had names based on the numbers five through ten: Quintilis (July), Sextilis (August), September, October, November, and December. However, this hypothesis is nuanced, requiring that the feminine praenomina Prima, Secunda, Tertia, and Quarta be explained by birth order and that Septimus, Octavius, and perhaps Nonus fell into disuse as praenomina over time, whilst continuing as gentilician names.

Several other praenomina were believed to refer to the circumstances of a child&#x27;s birth; for instance, Agrippa was said to refer to a child who was born feet-first; Caeso to a child born by the operation known today as a Caesarean section; Lucius to one born at dawn; Manius to one born in the morning; Numerius to one born easily; Opiter to one whose father had died, leaving his grandfather as head of the family; Postumus to a last-born child (whether or not the father was dead); Proculus to one whose father was far away; Vopiscus to the survivor of twins, the other of whom was born dead. Most of these are not based on credible etymology, although the meanings assigned to Lucius, Manius, and Postumus are probably reasonable.

Amongst other credible meanings assigned to praenomina, Faustus certainly means &quot;fortunate&quot; in Latin; Gaius is thought to derive from the same root as &quot;gaudere&quot;, &quot;to rejoice&quot;; Gnaeus refers to a birthmark; Marcus and Mamercus refer to the gods Mars and Mamers (perhaps an Oscan manifestation of Mars); Paullus means &quot;small&quot;; Servius appears to be derived from the same root as &quot;servare&quot;, &quot;to save&quot; or &quot;to keep safe&quot;; Volusus (also found as Volesus and Volero) seems to come from &quot;valere&quot;, &quot;to be strong&quot;.

One popular etymology that is certainly not correct belongs to Spurius, a praenomen that was amongst the most common, and favored by many leading patrician and plebeian families during the early Republic. It was later said that it was a contraction of the phrase, &quot;sine pater filius&quot;, &quot;son without a father&quot;, and thus used for children born out of wedlock. This belief may have led to the gradual disappearance of the name during the first century AD.

Appius is sometimes said to be of Oscan origin, since it is known chiefly from the descendants of Appius Claudius, a Sabine from the town of Cures, who came to Rome in the early years of the Republic, and was admitted to the Patriciate. His original name was said to be Attius Clausus, which he then Romanized. However, the praenomen Appius is known from other Latin sources, and may simply represent the Latin name closest in sound to Attius.

Aulus, Publius, Spurius, and Tiberius are sometimes attributed to Etruscan, in which language they are all common, although these names were also typical of praenomina used in families of indisputably Latin origin, such as the Postumii or the Cornelii. In this instance, it cannot be determined with any certainty whether these were Latin names which were borrowed by the Etruscans, or vice versa. The best case may be for Tiberius being an Etruscan name, since that praenomen was always connected with the sacred river on the boundary of Etruria and Latium, and the Etruscan name for the Tiber was &quot;Thebris&quot;. However, it still may be that the Romans knew the river by this name when the praenomen came into existence.

=== Historical trends ===
Many families, particularly amongst the great patrician houses, limited themselves to a small number of praenomina, probably as a means of distinguishing themselves from one another and from the plebeians, who used a wider variety of names. For example, the Cornelii used Aulus, Gnaeus, Lucius, Marcus, Publius, Servius, and Tiberius; the Julii limited themselves to Lucius, Gaius, Sextus, and Vopiscus; the Claudii were fond of Appius, Gaius, and Publius; the Postumii favored Aulus, Gaius, Lucius, Publius, and Spurius; and so on. The most prominent plebeian families also tended to limit the names of which they made regular use, although amongst both social classes, there must have been exceptions whenever a family had a large number of sons.

Many families avoided certain names, although the reasons varied. According to legend, the Junii avoided the names Titus and Tiberius because they were the names of two sons of Lucius Junius Brutus, the founder of the Republic, who were executed on the grounds that they had plotted to restore the king to power. Another legend relates that after Marcus Manlius Capitolinus was condemned for treason, the Roman Senate decreed that no member of &quot;gens Manlia&quot; should bear the praenomen Marcus, a tradition that seems to have been followed until the first century. However, normally such matters were left to the discretion of the family. In most instances, the reason why certain praenomina were preferred and others avoided probably arose from the desire to pass on family names.

Several names were used by only a few patrician families, although they were more widespread amongst the plebeians. For example: Appius was used only by the Claudii, Caeso by the Fabii and the Quinctii, Agrippa by the Furii and the Menenii, Numerius by the Fabii, Mamercus by the Aemilii and the Pinarii, Vopiscus only by the Julii, and Decimus was not used by any patrician family (unless the Junii were, as is sometimes believed, originally patrician), although it was widely used amongst the plebeians.

Throughout Roman history, the most common praenomen was Lucius, followed by Gaius, with Marcus in third place. During the most conservative periods, these three names could account for as much as fifty percent of the adult male population. At some distance were Publius and Quintus, only about half as common as Lucius, distantly followed by Titus. Aulus, Gnaeus, Spurius, Sextus, and Servius were less common, followed by Manius, Tiberius, Caeso, Numerius, and Decimus, which were decidedly uncommon (at least amongst the patricians) during the Republic.

Throughout Republican times, the number of praenomina in general use declined, but older names were occasionally revived by noble families, and occasionally anomalous names such as Ancus, Iulus, or Kanus were given. Some of these may have been ancient praenomina that had already passed out of common use by the early Republic. As they vanished from use as personal names, many older praenomina, such as Agrippa, Faustus, Mamercus, Paullus, Postumus, Proculus, and Vopiscus were revived as cognomina. Other examples of names that may once have been praenomina include Fusus, an early cognomen of &quot;gens Furia&quot;, and Cossus, a cognomen of &quot;gens Cornelia&quot;.

By the first century BC, the praenomina remaining in general use at Rome were: Appius, Aulus, Caeso, Decimus, Gaius, Gnaeus, Lucius, Mamercus, Manius, Marcus, Numerius, Publius, Quintus, Servius, Sextus, Spurius, Titus, and Tiberius. However, older names continued to be revived from time to time, especially in noble families, and they probably continued to be used outside Rome. By the second century, several of these names had also passed out of general use at Rome, leaving Aulus, Decimus, Gaius, Gnaeus, Lucius, Manius, Marcus, Numerius, Publius, Quintus, Sextus, Titus, and Tiberius.

Under the empire, confusion seems to have developed as to precisely what constituted a praenomen and how it should be used. A number of emperors considered &quot;Imperator&quot; as a praenomen, and thus part of their names. As a larger percentage of the Roman populace came from backgrounds that had never used traditional Roman names, the praenomen was frequently omitted, or at least ignored. In its place, an increasing number of magistrates and officials placed common nomina, frequently with praenomen-like abbreviations. The most common of these were Flavius (Fl.), Claudius (Cl.), Julius, Junius, Valerius (Val.), and Aurelius. These names appear almost arbitrarily, much like praenomina, and probably were intended to imply nobility, although ultimately they became so common as to lose any real significance.

== Oscan and Umbrian praenomina ==
Many Oscan praenomina appear throughout Roman history, as the Romans encountered both friendly and hostile tribes, and slowly absorbed the peoples of Italy into their sphere of influence. Umbrian praenomina are less well-known, but appear to have been similar to those of the Oscans. Although it is widely believed that the Latin praenomen &quot;Mamercus&quot; was of Oscan origin, since &quot;Mamers&quot; was a Sabine form of Mars, it is not clear to what extent the two cultures (which sprang from the same origin) borrowed praenomina from one another, and to what extent they shared names based on roots common to each language.

It is impossible to provide a complete list of Oscan praenomina, but these names are clearly identifiable in extant histories and inscriptions. Abbreviations do exist for some of them, but they were less regular, and less regularly employed, than the Latin abbreviations.
* Ancus
* Attius
* Decius
* Herius
* Marius
* Mettius
* Minatus
* Minius
* Nerius
* Novius
* Numa
* Numerius
* Ovius
* Paccius
* Pompo
* Salvius
* Seppius
* Statius
* Taurus
* Trebius
* Vibius
* Vettius
Notes:

* The &quot;-ius&quot; ending found in Latin sources is frequently found as &quot;-is&quot; or &quot;-iis&quot; in Oscan inscriptions.
* Ancus is known from only two sources: Ancus Marcius, the fourth King of Rome, who was of Sabine ancestry, and Ancus Publicius, an early member of a plebeian gens.
* Attius may be the Oscan equivalent of the Latin praenomen Appius, since the Sabine Attius Clausus took the name Appius Claudius upon settling at Rome; however, it could also simply have been the closest praenomen in sound.
* Decius, Pompo (and variations thereof), and Seppius are the Oscan equivalents of the Latin praenomina Decimus, Quintus, and Septimus. A &#x27;P&#x27; in Oscan frequently corresponded to a &#x27;Q&#x27; in Latin.
* Nerius, or Nero, a praenomen common to Oscan and Umbrian, was said to mean &quot;fortis ac strenuus&quot;, that is, &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;vigorous&quot;.

== Etruscan praenomina ==
The Etruscan language was unrelated to the other languages spoken in Italy, and accordingly it contains many names which have no equivalents in the Latin or Oscan languages. The Etruscan civilization, the most advanced of its time in that region, was a strong influence on the other peoples of Italy. The Etruscan alphabet (itself based on an early version of the Western or &quot;Red&quot; Greek alphabet) was the source for later Italian alphabets, including the modern Latin alphabet.

However, the cultural interchange was not all one-way. With respect to personal names, the Etruscans borrowed a large number of praenomina from Latin and Oscan, adding them to their own unique names. The Etruscan language is still imperfectly known, and the number of inscriptions are limited, so this list of Etruscan praenomina encompasses what has been discovered to this point. Included are names that are certainly praenomina, no matter their linguistic origin. Names that might be nomina or cognomina have not been included.

===Masculine names===

* Arruns (Ar.)
* Aule (A.)
* Cae (C.)
* Caeles
* Cneve (Cn.)
* Karcuna
* Lar
* Larce
* Laris (Lr.)
* Larth (La., Lth.)
* Lucie (L.)
* Mamarce (Mam.)
* Marce (M.)
* Maximus
* Metie
* Pavle
* Puplie (P.)
* Sethre (Se.)
* Spurie (S.)
* Thefarie
* Tite (T.)
* Uchtave
* Vel (Vl.)
* Velthur (Vth.)
* Vipie (V.)
Notes:

* The Romans rendered Lar, Larce, Laris, and Larth all as Lars.
* Aule, Cae, Cneve, Lucie, Mamarce, Marce, Metie, Pavle, Puplie, Spurie, Tite, Thefarie, Uchtave, and Vipie may be recognized as the Latin praenomina Aulus, Gaius, Gnaeus, Lucius, Mamercus, Marcus, Mettius, Paullus, Publius, Spurius, Titus, Tiberius, Octavius, and Vibius. There is no agreement on whether any of these were borrowed from Etruscan, or whether all were originally Latin.
* The Etruscans used a number of diminutives for both masculine and feminine names, including the masculine names Arnza (from Arruns), Venel, and Venox (from Vel).

===Feminine names===

* Fasti (F.)
* Hasti (H.)
* Larthi
* Lethi
* Ramtha (R.)
* Ravnthu
* Tanaquil (Thx.)
* Thana (Th.)
* Titia (T.)
* Vela
Notes:

* Fasti may be borrowed from the Latin praenomen Fausta. Hasti may be a variant of the same name.
* An example of a diminutive of a feminine praenomen is Ravntzu (from Ranvthu).

<text>Aldershot Town Football Club is a professional association football club based in Aldershot, Hampshire, England. The team competes in the National League, the fifth level of the English football league system.

The club was founded in the spring of 1992 after the closure of debt-ridden Fourth Division club Aldershot. Aldershot Town play at the Recreation Ground, which had also been the home ground of the previous club. Initially placed in the Isthmian League Third Division, Aldershot Town won the league in their debut 1992–93 season and won promotion out of the Second Division the following season. They won the First Division title in 1997–98 and the Premier Division in 2002–03 to gain a place in the Conference. They spent five seasons in the Conference, losing twice in the play-offs, before winning promotion into the Football League as Conference National and Conference League Cup champions under Gary Waddock&#x27;s stewardship in 2007–08. They spent five seasons in League Two, reaching the play-offs in 2010, though were relegated back into non-League football and entered administration in May 2013. They reached the National League play-offs in 2017 and 2018.

In March 1992, the town of Aldershot was without a football club after Aldershot F.C. became the first Football League team to fold during the football season since Accrington Stanley in 1962. The original Aldershot club had been in the Football League since 1932 and competed in the Third and Fourth Divisions. Promotion had been achieved as recently as 1987, but relegation followed two years later and debts well into six figures had almost brought about the club&#x27;s demise in the summer of 1990. Despite a rescue package allowing the original winding-up order to be rescinded, the club&#x27;s debts remained high and the club finally went bust just over 18 months later.

Aldershot Town was born later the same year, and began life competing in the Isthmian League Division Three. Despite Aldershot Town playing five divisions lower than the Football League, the attendance for their first competitive fixture was higher than the old team&#x27;s last home tie, with attendances that season averaging around 2,000 at a level where attendances normally averaged around 100.

Ten successive victories were recorded under the guidance of former player Steve Wignall and Aldershot won the championship by an 18-point margin.

A further promotion and an FA Vase quarter-final placing was achieved in the 1993–94 season. When Steve Wignall departed to take charge of Colchester United midway through the 1994–95 season, former Nottingham Forest winger Steve Wigley took over. The club finished the 1994–95 season with a run of six successive victories, but missed out on promotion by goal difference. After narrowly missing out during the next two seasons Wigley left in July 1997 to become Youth Development Officer at Nottingham Forest. He was replaced by George Borg, another former Aldershot FC player.

Attendances continued to rise during this period and the final fixture of the 1997–98 Isthmian League First Division championship-winning season, at home to Berkhamsted Town, attracted 4,289 fans to the Recreation Ground – a league record and an attendance comparable to that of many fourth and even third-tier clubs at the time.

The success under Borg continued with an Isthmian League Cup, two Hampshire Senior Cups and a runners-up spot in the Isthmian League Premier Division.

The club&#x27;s reserves were reinstated in 2000–01 and entered the Suburban League. The FA Cup in 2000–01 saw Aldershot take on league opposition at The Recreation Ground for the first time since reforming, when Brighton &amp; Hove Albion visited for a 1st Round tie in November and a record attendance of 7,500 saw the league team win. In the following season&#x27;s FA Cup the Shots held Bristol Rovers to a home draw in the First Round, but again missed out on the Second Round after losing the replay in Bristol.

George Borg resigned as manager in November 2001 after pressure from supporters and was replaced by Terry Brown. He won his first game in charge beating Newport IOW 1–0 in the Hampshire Senior Cup Semi-final Second Leg, taking The Shots on to win the final against Havant &amp; Waterlooville. In Brown&#x27;s first full season in charge he overhauled the squad, and by mid-November the Shots were top of the table, a position they did not relinquish for the remainder of the season, winning promotion to the Football Conference. After just 11 years, four promotions had now been achieved and just one more promotion was required for league football to return to Aldershot.

The club also retained the Hampshire Senior Cup with a 2–1 win over Bashley.

===Conference years===

A crowd of 3,680 saw Aldershot&#x27;s first game in the Conference, a 2–1 win over Accrington Stanley. The club went on to stay in the play-off positions in the league table for all but 3 days of the season. The Shots equalled their best ever run in the FA Cup, reaching the 2nd Round and losing 1–0 to Colchester United at Layer Road. The club reached their first FA Trophy semi-final, losing to eventual winners Hednesford Town and the average attendance for league matches at The Rec ended on a record high of 3,303.

A 1–1 draw against Tamworth on the last day of the season carried the Shots into the play-offs for a place in the Football League. Over two legs the Shots held their own against favourites Hereford United, drawing 1–1 at The Rec and 0–0 at Edgar Street. Extra time finished without any further score and the tie was concluded on penalties with the Shots winning 4–2. The 2004 Conference play-off Final against Shrewsbury Town finished 1–1 after extra time. Shrewsbury returned to the league with a 3–0 win in the penalty shoot-out.

In May 2004 the club officers made the decision to convert Aldershot Town to full-time professional status from the following July. In 2004–05 the Shots once again equalled their best ever run in the FA Cup as they reached the 2nd Round proper, where they lost 5–1 to Hartlepool United. After a slow start in the league, Aldershot improved their form and reached the play-offs after beating Scarborough in the last game of the season. The Shots won the first leg against Carlisle United 1–0 at home, but lost the away leg 2–1, giving a 2–2 aggregate score. Extra time could not separate the sides and the tie went to penalties, with Carlisle winning the shootout.

The next two seasons were less successful for the Shots. 2005–06 saw Aldershot&#x27;s team suffer numerous injuries, and they struggled to 13th in the table. The team made it to the 2nd round of the FA Cup, losing 1–0 at home to Scunthorpe United. The next season was equally disappointing, with the side never really getting close enough to the aim of finishing in the playoff positions. The club eventually made it to 9th in the reformed 24 club Conference Premier, finishing 13 points off the playoffs. Terry Brown resigned, citing the poor health of his wife as the primary reason, although his position may have been untenable with regards to the season&#x27;s performance. Martin Kuhl took over as caretaker manager. They made it to the Third round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 4–2 at Bloomfield Road to Blackpool

====Promotion to the Football League====
In May 2007 Gary Waddock was appointed the new manager, with Martin Kuhl reverting to his coaching position. The Shots started the season strongly, losing few games before the turn of the year. Jonny Dixon was sold to Brighton and Hove Albion in the January Transfer window for a then club record of £56,000. The Shots finished top of the Conference Premier with a record 101 points, and were promoted to the Football League, for the first time since the club was reformed ending the season on an 18-match undefeated run.

The Shots also made it to the Conference League Cup Final after a 4–3 penalty shoot out victory over near neighbours Woking in the semi-final. The final, played at the Recreation Ground on 3 April, was against Rushden &amp; Diamonds. With the scores 1–1 at full-time, then 3–3 after extra time, Aldershot won 4–3 on penalties.

===Football League===
Sixteen years after the demise of Aldershot F.C., the town of Aldershot had a Football League team again. The club retained much of the 2007–08 promotion winning team, and added several signings, both permanent and on loan. Gary Waddock and Martin Kuhl also committed their futures to the club by signing new three-year contracts. Joel Grant was sold to Crewe Alexandra for £130,000, a club record. On the opening day of the 2008–09 season, Aldershot Town won their first league game on their return to the Football League at Accrington Stanley 1–0. This was followed four days later by the club&#x27;s first ever EFL Cup game, against Coventry City at the Ricoh Arena, which the Shots lost 3–1. The Shots finished fifteenth in League Two in their first season in the Football League.

Two months into the 2009–10 season, manager Gary Waddock and assistant Martin Kuhl accepted offers to join Wycombe Wanderers. Jason Dodd was appointed as Caretaker Manager, assisted by Paul Williams before Kevin Dillon, the former first-team coach of Reading, was appointed as Waddock&#x27;s permanent successor in November 2009. Two days later Dillon appointed Gary Owers as his assistant manager. Under the new management team Aldershot finished the season in sixth place, qualifying them for the play-offs, where they lost 3–0 on aggregate to Rotherham United.

In January 2011 Kevin Dillon and assistant Gary Owers had left the club by mutual agreement, with the club lying 20th in League Two, after winning just 6 out of 22 league games. Dillon was replaced by Newport County manager Dean Holdsworth. Holdsworth succeeded in removing the threat of relegation, eventually guiding the club to 14th position in a run which included only 4 defeats in the second half of the season.
Aldershot finished 11th in the 2011–12. A good run in the League Cup saw Aldershot take on Manchester United at home, which ended in a 3–0 victory for the Red Devils. Holdsworth was sacked by Aldershot on 20 February 2013 with the team in 20th place in League Two.

===Administration and return to Conference===

In the summer 2012, a major shareholder suffered a major stroke, debilitating him and creating a financial insecurity that would prove dangerous come the following year. In May 2013, Aldershot Town announced that they were in financial difficulties, with players&#x27; wages going unpaid. The Chief Executive, Andrew Mills, announced his resignation saying that there was no evidence that the major shareholder Kris Machala had the ability to fund the club. Director Tony Knights admitted that the club has been &quot;haemorrhaging money&quot;. On 2 May 2013, just five days after their relegation from the Football League, Aldershot Town officially entered administration. The club fell with debts of over £1 million.

On 1 August 2013, Aldershot Town confirmed the takeover of the club by a consortium led by former chairman Shahid Azeem. In conjunction, the club announced the agreement of a lucrative deal with Chelsea to host a significant number of matches played by the Chelsea Academy and Reserves over the next two years.

Aldershot Town were relegated from the National League in 2019 after finishing 21st. However, they were reprieved from relegation after Gateshead were administratively relegated. 
 The 2019–20 National League was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic with the Shots finishing in 18th place based on points per game. Aldershot Town finished 15th in the 2020–21 season finishing with 52 points. In the 2021–22 season they finished 20th and in the 2022–23 season they finished 18th.

==Recent seasons==
Statistics for the previous decade. For a full history see; &quot;List of Aldershot Town F.C. seasons&quot;
==Stadium==

Aldershot Town play their home games at The Recreation Ground, which has a capacity of 7,100. The stadium was previously the home of Aldershot F.C. The stadium&#x27;s current sponsor is EBB Paper, therefore the ground is advertly known as The EBB Stadium at The Recreation Ground, however is affectionately known as &#x27;The Rec&#x27;.

In March 2018, Aldershot Town presented proposals for the redevelopment of the EBB Stadium to Rushmoor Borough Council which would see the potential development of a new stadium, containing both seating and standing areas, that will give the club a &#x27;long-term home from which to build our ambitions on the pitch&#x27;.

==Records and statistics==
===Appearances and goals===

Jason Chewins holds the record for the most number of appearances for the club, playing 489 times between August 1994 and May 2004. This led to the left-back being the first and, to date, only player to receive a testimonial match, which was played against Portsmouth in July 2004.

Before Chewins, the record was held by Mark Butler, who joined the club at its inception in 1992. Butler played 303 times between August 1992 and May 1998, also holding the all-time goal scoring record by netting 155 times, a record he still currently holds. Former goalkeeper Nikki Bull made his 300th appearance for the Shots in November 2008 and eventually made 313 appearances before moving to Brentford in July 2009. Five others have played more than 200 times for the club, including Stuart Udal, whose cousin Shaun was an England international cricketer. Winger Jimmy Sugrue has also reached the landmark. More recently, three members of the 2007–08 title winning squad, namely Anthony Charles, Anthony Straker and Danny Hylton reached the landmark.

Gary Abbott is, apart from Butler, the only Shots player to have ever scored over 100 goals for the club. Over the course of three seasons, between August 1998 and May 2001, he scored 120 goals.

== Rivalries ==

Aldershot Town&#x27;s local rivals are Rushmoor neighbours Farnborough and Surrey side Woking. Fixtures against these sides attract larger than average crowds, including 5,961 for a Hampshire Senior Cup semi-final, a league record 5,518 in an Isthmian League Premier Division match against Farnborough and 6,870 for an FA Cup 1st round match against Woking.

The original Aldershot were rivals with Reading until their demise in 1992 but are still considered the main rival of the club by supporters. The only meeting between the two clubs since the rebirth of Aldershot was a friendly in 2001 which resulted in an outbreak of violence between the two sets of fans and multiple arrests.

Aldershot also has a friendly relationship and close ties with &quot;sister club&quot; Badshot Lea. The two annually hold pre-season fixtures against each other. On 6 July 2019, the two played in the inaugural match of Badshot Lea&#x27;s new stadium Westfield Lane, seen by 660 spectators, a record attendance for The Baggies still hold today.

<doc id="244091" wikidata="Q838747" url="?curid=244091" title="Dowitcher">
<text>The three dowitchers are medium-sized long-billed wading birds in the genus Limnodromus. The English name &quot;dowitcher&quot; is from Iroquois, recorded in English by the 1830s.

They resemble godwits in body and bill shape, and the reddish underparts in summer, but are much shorter legged, more like snipes, to which they are more closely related. All three are strongly migratory.

The two North American species are difficult to separate in most plumages, and were considered a single species for many years. The Asian bird is rare and not well known.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Limnodromus&quot; was introduced in 1833 by the German naturalist Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied to accommodate a single species, the short-billed dowitcher. The name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;limnē&quot; meaning &quot;marsh&quot; with &quot;-dromos&quot; meaning &quot;-racer&quot; or &quot;-runner&quot;.

The dowitcher species are:

<doc id="244094" wikidata="Q7137435" url="?curid=244094" title="Parish council (England)">
<text>A parish council is a civil local authority found in England, which is the lowest tier of local government. Parish councils are elected corporate bodies, with variable tax raising powers, and they carry out beneficial public activities in geographical areas known as civil parishes. There are about 10,480 parish and town councils in England. Parish councils may be known by different styles, they may resolve to call themselves a town council, village council, community council, neighbourhood council, or if the parish has city status, it may call itself a city council. However their powers and duties are the same whatever name they carry.

Parish councils receive the majority of their funding by levying a precept upon the council tax paid by the residents of the parish (or parishes) covered by the council. In 2021-22 the amount raised by precept was £616 million. Other funding may be obtained by local fund-raising or grants for specific activities. 
They can vary enormously in size, activities and circumstances; representing populations ranging from fewer than 100 (small rural hamlets) to up to 130,000 (Northampton Town Council). Most of them are small: around 80% represent populations of less than 2,500; Parish councils are made up of unpaid councillors who are elected to serve for four years: there are about 70,000 parish councillors country-wide.

Not every civil parish has a parish council: smaller ones, typically those with fewer than 150 electors, often have parish meetings instead, which can fulfil many of the functions of a parish council. Alternatively, parishes with small populations may apply to be grouped together with one or more neighbouring parishes under a common parish council.

Civil parish councils were formed in England under the reforming Local Government Act 1894 (56 &amp; 57 Vict. c. 73) to take over local oversight of civic duties in rural towns and villages from the vestry committee. Parish councils are generically referred to as &quot;local councils&quot; to distinguish them from &quot;principal councils&quot; (e.g. district councils, county councils, unitary authorities or London borough councils) and most are affiliated via County Associations to the National Association of Local Councils (NALC), which represents their interests at a national level.

==Powers and duties==

Their activities fall into three main categories: representing the local community, delivering services to meet local needs, and improving quality of life and community well being.

Parish councils have the power to tax their residents to support their operations and to carry out local projects, and this is done through the council tax system. Although there is no limit to the amount that can be raised, the money can only be raised for a limited number of purposes, listed below, as defined in the 1894 Act and subsequent legislation. Compared to higher tiers of English local government, parish councils have very few statutory duties (i.e. things they are required to do by law) but have a much more extensive range of discretionary powers which they may exercise voluntarily. For this reason, there are large variations in the activities of parish councils, depending on their size, resources and abilities. The &quot;General Power of Competence&quot; is a power awarded in 2012 to eligible councils, which further broadens the scope of activities that councils can be involved in.

===Duty to provide facilities===

* Allotments - Duty to consider providing allotment gardens if demand unsatisfied.

===Powers to provide facilities===
Parish councils may exercise powers to provide, maintain and manage certain facilities. There are large variations in the facilities provided by parish councils, but they can include any of the following:
* Buildings for community use, such as village halls, town halls or community centres
* Recreational facilities such as parks, playgrounds, playing fields and swimming baths
* Cemeteries and crematoria
* Litter bins
* Public seats
* Public toilets
* Public clocks
* Cycle and motorcycle parking
* Maintenance of rights of way
* Guardianship of common land (such as village greens)
* Maintenance of war memorials

They may also provide the following, subject to the consent of the county council, unitary authority or London borough council of the area in which they lie:

*Bus shelters
*Lighting of roads and public places
*Off-street car parks
*Certain traffic signs and other public notices
*Provision, maintenance and protection of roadside verges
*Establishment or acquisition of markets, and provision of market places and market buildings
===Consultative powers===
Parish councils have the statutory right to be consulted by the local district, borough, county council or unitary authority on:

* All planning applications in their areas
* Intention to provide a burial ground in the parish
* Proposals to carry out sewerage works
* Footpath and bridleway (more generally, &#x27;rights of way&#x27;) surveys
* Intention to make byelaws in relation to hackney carriages, music and dancing, promenades, sea shore and street naming
* The appointment of governors of primary schools
===Miscellaneous powers===
Parish councils may also exercise the following powers:

* Sponsoring public events
* Support of the arts and provision of entertainment
* Encouragement of tourism
* Providing grants to local voluntary organisations
* Funding crime prevention measures
* Providing grants for bus services, and funding community transport schemes
* Contribution of money towards traffic calming schemes
* Cleaning and drainage of ponds, watercourses and ditches
* Power to obtain water from any well, spring or stream
* Creation of a neighbourhood plan
* Power to acquire or dispose of land 
* Withholding of consent to stop up unclassified highways and footpaths
* Appointing trustees of local charities
* Power to make byelaws in regard to pleasure grounds, cycle parks, baths and washhouses, open spaces and burial grounds, and mortuaries and post-mortem rooms.
*Under the 2021 Environment Act, public authorities (including town and parish councils) operating in England must consider what they can do to conserve and enhance biodiversity.
===General power of competence===
Under the Localism Act 2011 eligible parish councils can be granted a &quot;general power of competence&quot; (GPC) which allows them within certain limits the freedom to do anything an individual can do provided it is not prohibited by other legislation, as opposed to being limited to the powers explicitly granted to them by law. To be eligible for this a parish council must meet certain conditions, such as at least two-thirds of the councillors being elected as opposed to being co-opted or appointed, and having a clerk with suitable qualifications. However, such activities cannot use precept funding, and specific funding must be obtained from other sources.

In principle the GPC can allow councils to engage in a range of activities such as setting up a trading company or co-operative to operate commercial activities, such as lending or investing money, or running a local shop, post office or energy company. Or allow it to contribute towards the provision of a service by another authority.

==Meetings==
The central function of the Council, the making of local decisions and policy relevant to the public interest of the parish, is performed at the meetings of the Council. A parish council must hold an annual meeting and at least three other meetings in a year; however, monthly meetings are the most common, and some larger councils have fortnightly meetings. An extraordinary meeting may be called at any time by the chairman or members, but due notice must be given.

A parish council consists of no fewer than five elected parish councillors, including the chairman, and a quorum of the main council committee is at least one-third of the members, or three members, whichever is the greater. Every meeting is open to the public, who are encouraged to attend, except for those items where the Council formally resolves to exclude the public and press on the grounds that publicity would be prejudicial to the public interest. This would have to be due to the confidential nature of the business. This latter also applies to any subcommittee of the parish council.

A Council can form committees with delegated powers for specific purposes; however these must adhere to the protocols for public attendance, minute-taking and notice of meetings that apply to the main Council. A committee may form sub-committees. A Council can also appoint advisory groups which are exempt from these constraints to give flexibility, but these have no delegated powers and cannot make financial decisions. Such groups may contain members who are not councillors.

Public notice of meetings of the council and its committees must be given at least three clear days before and be displayed in a &quot;noticeable place&quot; in the Parish, giving time, date and venue. A summons to attend the meeting is also issued, specifying the agenda, to every member of the Council. Items not on the agenda cannot be formally debated or resolved. Items brought up by the attendance of the general public or in correspondence can be discussed, but formal resolutions on these must be deferred if they are not covered by the existing agenda to the next meeting so that due notice can be given. It is common practice to have a &quot;public participation&quot; item at the beginning of the agenda so that the public knows the time when this will occur.

The minutes of the meeting are taken by the clerk, and are ratified at the next meeting of the council. They must also be displayed in a noticeable place in the parish, and for many councils, they are now also displayed on the internet.

Procedures for the conduct of meetings are set out in Schedule 12 of the Local Government Act 1972, and where this is not overridden by legislation, by the standing orders of the Council. Most adopt the National Association of Local Councils (NALC) model standing orders.

Councillors are expected to adhere to the &quot;Nolan principles&quot; of conduct in public life

==Administration==
The administration of the Council is managed by its Clerk, a paid employee appointed by the council, who acts in a combined statutory role of Proper Officer (secretary or chief executive) and Responsible Financial Officer (treasurer). They may be full-time or part-time, depending on the amount of council business, and large parish councils may require more than one official for these tasks, in which case they are a group led by the Clerk.

The Clerk as the Proper Officer &quot;enacts&quot; (cause to happen) the decisions of the Council, and they receive official correspondence and issue correspondence on the instructions of the Council. The clerk also prepares agendas for meetings of the Council and its committees, gives notice of these to the Council members and the public, and records and publishes the minutes of these meetings. The Clerk is the formal point of contact with the public, and a source of information for the public about the Council&#x27;s activities.
The necessary financial monitoring and reporting are the clerk&#x27;s responsibility, and in this role the clerk is known as the &quot;Responsible Financial Officer&quot; (RFO) of the Council. 
The clerk also provides procedural guidance for the Council itself, and ensures that statutory and other provisions governing or affecting the running of the Council are observed. Clerks are encouraged to have a formal qualification, such as the Certificate in Local Council Administration (CiLCA).
A councillor cannot become the paid clerk of their council, due to conflict of interest, but they can be appointed on an unpaid basis; preferably temporarily. A councillor cannot become a paid clerk until 12 months after leaving office.

==Elections and membership==
The cycle of parish council elections is four years, and councillors are elected by the block vote system, with voters having the same number of votes as seats on the council, in a secret ballot. Those candidates with the highest number of votes sufficient to fill the number of vacant seats are elected. The legislation provides that the number of elected members of a parish council shall not be less than five. Larger parishes may be divided into parish wards, with separate elections for each ward.

The timing of the election cycle is usually linked to that of the election of a district councillor for the ward containing the parish. Where the elections to a district council are delayed or cancelled (e.g due to its abolishment with the formation of a unitary council or a change from elections by thirds to the whole council), the term of a parish council may be extended to match the next elections to the new authority.

A candidate must be at least 18 years old and at least one of the following:

* A British citizen, an eligible Commonwealth citizen
* Citizen of Ireland
* Citizen of any member state of the European Union

and candidates must state on their consent for nomination form their qualification for election, which must be at least one of the following:

* they are a registered elector of the parish
* during the whole of the 12 months before the day of nomination and the day of election they have occupied, either as owner or tenant, any land or other premises in the parish.
* their main or only place of work is in the parish during the whole of the 12 months before the day of nomination and the day of election.
* they have lived within 4.8 kilometres (3 miles) of the parish boundary for 12 months before the day of nomination and the day of election.

The chairman of the previous council shall remain in office, even if not elected to the newly constituted council, until a new chairman is appointed at the first meeting of the new council.

===Uncontested elections===
Where there are an equal number or fewer candidates than there are vacancies, all candidates are elected unopposed, and no poll is taken. Where there are fewer candidates than vacant seats, the parish council has the power to coopt any person or persons to fill the vacancies. This power, however, may only be exercised if there is a quorum of councillors present and within 35 days of the election.

If the parish council fails to fill the vacancies within this period, the district council &quot;may&quot; dissolve it and order fresh elections. If there is not a quorum elected the district council &quot;must&quot; dissolve it and order fresh elections.
===Contested elections===
Where there are more candidates than vacancies, a poll must be held. Undivided parishes, or multi-member parish wards, hold elections under the block vote system.

===Casual vacancies===
If a vacancy occurs during the term of a parish council, it may be filled by either election or co-option. Elections only occur if, following the advertisement of the vacancy for 14 days, 10 electors send a written request to the returning officer. If no request is received, the parish council will be required to fill the vacancies by co-option. If vacancy occurs within 6 months of a scheduled election, then a by-election cannot be called, but the council has the power to co-opt. The nomination qualifications required of a candidate for co-option are the same as for those for election.

If the number of vacancies on the parish council is such that there is no longer a quorum, the district council may temporarily appoint persons to bring the council up to strength in the interval prior to an election.

==History==
Civil parish councils were formed in England under the reforming Local Government Act 1894 (56 &amp; 57 Vict. c. 73) to take over local oversight of civic duties in rural towns and villages. The act created two new types of local authority, parish councils and district councils, to rationalise the large number of bodies which existed for a variety of activities such as public health, secular burials, water supply and drainage. It also finally removed secular duties from the local vestry committees and gave them to the new parish councils.

An idea of the scope of this huge re-organisation can be gained from the words of H H Fowler, President of the Local Government Board, who said in the parliamentary debate for the 1894 Act:

The government chose the civil parish as the basic unit of local government in rural areas. Each parish council&#x27;s area of responsibility was a geographical area known as a civil parish. The civil parishes were also grouped to form rural districts, which became the geographical areas of rural district councils. Civil geographical parishes continued to exist in urban districts, but did not have parish councils.

Whilst the bulk of the rationalised activities went to district councils, parish councils took over a number of lesser powers including all the secular activities of the parish Vestry committee; a system of local government based on ecclesiastical parishes that originated in the feudal system.

==Modern development==
Two principal Acts of Parliament have increased the general powers of parish councils, and removed onerous constraints.

===Local Government Act 1972===
The Redcliffe-Maud Report led to the Local Government Act 1972, which dramatically re-organised local government with amalgamation of district councils, large-scale changes to county boundaries and creation of metropolitan areas. However, the parish council was retained as the &quot;grass roots&quot; tier of local democracy for rural areas. In addition, many small towns which had previously formed municipal boroughs or urban districts became &quot;successor parishes&quot; within larger districts. The Act also recognised the role of parish councils in development planning in their parish, and gave them the right to be informed and consulted on applications for such development. However, the original proposal to grant a general power of competence to councils was not carried through, and the doctrine of &quot;ultra vires&quot; remained. This meant that parish councils could not do anything outside their statutory powers.

===Localism Act 2011===
It was not until the Localism Act 2011 that parish councils were freed of the constraints of ultra vires which had limited the activities of parish councils to only those things for which they had been given statutory powers. They were given a radical new power: to &quot;do anything that individuals generally may do&quot; as long as that is not limited by some other Act. This is known as the General Power of Competence (GPC), and is available to &quot;eligible&quot; parish councils. An eligible council is one which has resolved to adopt the GPC, with at least two-thirds of its members being declared elected, rather than co-opted, and the Clerk must hold an appropriate qualification. However the precept may not be raised specifically for activities which rely only on the power of the GPC, and such funding must be obtained from other sources.

The Localism Act also introduced new rights and powers to allow local communities to shape new development by coming together to prepare neighbourhood plans. Neighbourhood planning can be taken forward by two types of body: town and parish councils or &quot;neighbourhood forums&quot;. Neighbourhood forums are community groups that are designated to take forward neighbourhood planning in areas without parishes. It is the role of the local planning authority to agree who should be the neighbourhood forum for the neighbourhood area.

Neighbourhood forums and parish councils can use new neighbourhood planning powers to establish general planning policies for the development and use of land in a neighbourhood. These are described legally as &quot;neighbourhood development plans&quot;. In an important change to the planning system, communities can use neighbourhood planning to permit the development they want to see - in full or in outline – without the need for planning applications. These are called &quot;neighbourhood development orders&quot;.

==Alternative styles==
In 1974, the local government reforms allowed the creation of successor parish councils, to cover those areas formerly the responsibility of a municipal corporation. Such an area could be declared a &quot;town&quot;, and the council would then be known as a &quot;town council&quot;. The majority of successor parishes, and a number of other small market towns now have town councils, with the power of parish councils but their chairmen are entitled to style themselves as &quot;town mayor&quot;. Similarly, a handful of parishes have been granted city status by letters patent: the council of such a parish is known as &quot;city council&quot; and the chairman is entitled to be known as the &quot;city mayor&quot;.

In England, there are currently eight parishes with city status, all places with long-established Anglican cathedrals: Chichester, Ely, Hereford, Lichfield, Ripon, Salisbury, Truro and Wells. Despite its name, the City of Durham Parish Council is not a city; Durham&#x27;s city status is held by charter trustees.

Following the enactment of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, a parish council has been able to alternatively style itself as a &quot;village council&quot;, &quot;neighbourhood council&quot; or &quot;community council&quot;. A provision of this Act is that is that civil parishes may now be established in the London boroughs.

==Creation, alteration and abolition of councils==
Since the enactment of the Local Government and Rating Act 1997, district and unitary councils may create a parish council for a new civil parish either through a review or in response to a petition. This has led to the creation of new parish councils at an increased rate, especially in large towns and cities which do not have a history of parish governance.

Since 13 February 2008 the power to create new parishes and parish councils, to alter parish boundaries, to dissolve parish councils and to abolish parishes has been devolved to district, unitary and London Borough councils (collectively known as &quot;principal councils&quot;). This process is known as a &quot;community governance review&quot;.

Principal councils have the power to make a community governance review at any time for all or part of their district. It is envisaged that such reviews will occur at intervals of between 10 and 15 years, and will take into account population changes, the need for well-defined boundaries and the wishes of local inhabitants. Reviews may also be triggered by a petition of local government electors for an area. A petition is deemed valid where it is signed by a sufficient proportion of the electorate (ranging from 50% in an area with fewer than 500 electors to 10% in one with more than 2,500). The sufficient proportion of the electorate necessary in areas with more than 2,500 electors was reduced from 10% to 7.5% under an amendment to the Act made in 2015.
At the end of the review process, which must be completed within 12 months, the principal council is empowered to issue a reorganisation order setting out the changes. This order may:

* Create a new parish
** From all or part of an unparished area
** By the division of an existing parish or parishes
** By the merger of all or parts of existing parishes
* Alter the boundaries of existing parishes
* Group or ungroup parishes
* Give a name to a new parish
* Abolish an existing parish and dissolve its parish council

In order to abolish an existing parish council, the principal council must provide evidence that this in response to &quot;justified, clear and sustained local support&quot; from the area&#x27;s inhabitants. Where a new parish is formed with 1,000 electors or more, a parish council must be formed. Where there are between 151 and 999 electors the principal council may recommend the establishment of either a parish council or parish meeting. Where there are 150 electors or fewer a parish council may not be formed.

Reviews come into effect on 1 April in the year following the date the reorganisation order is made. Where a new parish council is created, elections to the new body will be held at the time of next council elections. In the intervening period the principal council appoint the parish council from among their own membership.

<text>The gens Sulpicia was one of the most ancient patrician families at ancient Rome, and produced a succession of distinguished men, from the foundation of the Republic to the imperial period. The first member of the gens who obtained the consulship was Servius Sulpicius Camerinus Cornutus, in 500 BC, only nine years after the expulsion of the Tarquins, and the last of the name who appears on the consular list was Sextus Sulpicius Tertullus in AD 158. Although originally patrician, the family also possessed plebeian members, some of whom may have been descended from freedmen of the gens.

==Praenomina==
The Sulpicii made regular use of only four praenomina: &quot;Publius, Servius, Quintus&quot;, and &quot;Gaius&quot;. The only other praenomen appearing under the Republic is &quot;Marcus&quot;, known from the father of Gaius Sulpicius Peticus, five times consul during the fourth century BC. The last of the Sulpicii known to have held the consulship, in the second century AD, was named &quot;Sextus&quot;, a praenomen otherwise unknown in this gens.

==Branches and cognomina==
During the Republic, several branches of the Sulpician gens were identified by numerous cognomina, including &quot;Camerinus, Cornutus, Galba, Gallus, Longus, Paterculus, Peticus, Praetextatus, Quirinus, Rufus, and Saverrio&quot;. In addition to these cognomina, we meet with some other surnames belonging to freedmen and to other persons under the Empire. On coins we find the surnames &quot;Galba, Platorinus, Proclus&quot;, and &quot;Rufus&quot;.

&quot;Camerinus&quot; was the name of an old patrician family of the Sulpicia gens, which probably derived its name from the ancient town of Cameria or Camerium, in Latium. Many of them bore the agnomen &quot;Cornutus&quot;, from a Latin adjective meaning &quot;horned&quot;. The Camerini frequently held the highest offices in the state in the early times of the Republic; but after 345 BC, when Servius Sulpicius Camerinus Rufus was consul, we do not hear of them again for upwards of three hundred years, till Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus obtained the consulship in AD 9. The family was reckoned one of the noblest in Rome in the early times of the Empire.

The Praetextati appear in the second half of the fifth century BC. The family appears to have been a small one, descended from the Camerini. It probably derived its name from one of several related meanings. &quot;Praetextus&quot; commonly referred to clothing with a decorative border, and especially to the &quot;toga praetexta&quot;, a toga with a purple border worn by boys and magistrates. Something veiled or concealed could also be described as &quot;praetextatus&quot;.

The Sulpicii Longi flourished during the fourth century BC, from the time of the Gallic sack of Rome in 390 to the period of the Samnite Wars. The cognomen &quot;Longus&quot; may have been bestowed upon the ancestor of this family because he was particularly tall.

The surname &quot;Rufus&quot;, meaning &quot;red&quot;, probably referred to the color of the hair of one of the Sulpicii, and may have begun as a cadet branch of the Camerini, as both cognomina were united in the consul of 345 BC. Several Sulpicii bearing this surname appear towards the end of the Republic, but as some appear to have been patricians and others plebeians, they may have constituted two distinct families.

The Sulpicii Galli were a family of the second and third centuries BC. Their cognomen may refer to a cock, or to a Gaul. The greatest of this family, Gaius Sulpicius Gallus, was a successful general and statesman, as well as an orator and scholar much admired by Cicero.

The Sulpicii Galbae first came to prominence during the Second Punic War, and remained distinguished until the first century AD, when Servius Sulpicius Galba claimed the title of Emperor. Suetonius gives four possible explanations of this surname: that the first of the family burnt a town he had besieged, using torches smeared with &quot;galbanum&quot;, a type of gum; or that, chronically ill, he made regular use of a type of remedy wrapped in wool, known as &quot;galbeum&quot;; or that &quot;galba&quot; was a Gallic word for someone very fat; or instead that he resembled a &quot;galba&quot;, a grub or caterpillar. The surname may also share a common root with the adjective &quot;galbinus&quot;, a greenish-yellow color.

<text>In signal processing and statistics, a window function (also known as an apodization function or tapering function) is a mathematical function that is zero-valued outside of some chosen interval. Typically, window functions are symmetric around the middle of the interval, approach a maximum in the middle, and taper away from the middle. Mathematically, when another function or waveform/data-sequence is &quot;multiplied&quot; by a window function, the product is also zero-valued outside the interval: all that is left is the part where they overlap, the &quot;view through the window&quot;. Equivalently, and in actual practice, the segment of data within the window is first isolated, and then only that data is multiplied by the window function values. Thus, tapering, not segmentation, is the main purpose of window functions.

The reasons for examining segments of a longer function include detection of transient events and time-averaging of frequency spectra. The duration of the segments is determined in each application by requirements like time and frequency resolution. But that method also changes the frequency content of the signal by an effect called spectral leakage. Window functions allow us to distribute the leakage spectrally in different ways, according to the needs of the particular application. There are many choices detailed in this article, but many of the differences are so subtle as to be insignificant in practice.

In typical applications, the window functions used are non-negative, smooth, &quot;bell-shaped&quot; curves. Rectangle, triangle, and other functions can also be used. A more general definition of window functions does not require them to be identically zero outside an interval, as long as the product of the window multiplied by its argument is square integrable, and, more specifically, that the function goes sufficiently rapidly toward zero.

== Applications ==
Window functions are used in spectral analysis/modification/resynthesis, the design of finite impulse response filters, merging multiscale and multidimensional datasets, as well as beamforming and antenna design.

=== Spectral analysis ===
The Fourier transform of the function is zero, except at frequency ±&quot;ω&quot;. However, many other functions and waveforms do not have convenient closed-form transforms. Alternatively, one might be interested in their spectral content only during a certain time period.

In either case, the Fourier transform (or a similar transform) can be applied on one or more finite intervals of the waveform. In general, the transform is applied to the product of the waveform and a window function. Any window (including rectangular) affects the spectral estimate computed by this method.

=== Filter design ===
Windows are sometimes used in the design of digital filters, in particular to convert an &quot;ideal&quot; impulse response of infinite duration, such as a sinc function, to a finite impulse response (FIR) filter design. That is called the &quot;window method&quot;.

=== Statistics and curve fitting ===
Window functions are sometimes used in the field of statistical analysis to restrict the set of data being analyzed to a range near a given point, with a weighting factor that diminishes the effect of points farther away from the portion of the curve being fit. In the field of Bayesian analysis and curve fitting, this is often referred to as the kernel.

=== Rectangular window applications ===
==== Analysis of transients ====

When analyzing a transient signal in modal analysis, such as an impulse, a shock response, a sine burst, a chirp burst, or noise burst, where the energy vs time distribution is extremely uneven, the rectangular window may be most appropriate. For instance, when most of the energy is located at the beginning of the recording, a non-rectangular window attenuates most of the energy, degrading the signal-to-noise ratio.

==== Harmonic analysis ====
One might wish to measure the harmonic content of a musical note from a particular instrument or the harmonic distortion of an amplifier at a given frequency. Referring again to Figure 2, we can observe that there is no leakage at a discrete set of harmonically-related frequencies sampled by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). (The spectral nulls are actually zero-crossings, which cannot be shown on a logarithmic scale such as this.) This property is unique to the rectangular window, and it must be appropriately configured for the signal frequency, as described above.

== Overlapping windows ==
When the length of a data set to be transformed is larger than necessary to provide the desired frequency resolution, a common practice is to subdivide it into smaller sets and window them individually. To mitigate the &quot;loss&quot; at the edges of the window, the individual sets may overlap in time. See Welch method of power spectral analysis and the modified discrete cosine transform.

== Two-dimensional windows ==

Two-dimensional windows are commonly used in image processing to reduce unwanted high-frequencies in the image Fourier transform. They can be constructed from one-dimensional windows in either of two forms. The separable form, formula_1 is trivial to compute. The radial form, formula_2, which involves the radius formula_3, is isotropic, independent on the orientation of the coordinate axes. Only the Gaussian function is both separable and isotropic. The separable forms of all other window functions have corners that depend on the choice of the coordinate axes. The isotropy/anisotropy of a two-dimensional window function is shared by its two-dimensional Fourier transform. The difference between the separable and radial forms is akin to the result of diffraction from rectangular vs. circular apertures, which can be visualized in terms of the product of two sinc functions vs. an Airy function, respectively.

== Examples of window functions ==

Conventions:

*formula_4 is a zero-phase function (symmetrical about formula_5), continuous for formula_6 where formula_7 is a positive integer (even or odd).
*The sequence formula_8 is &quot;symmetric&quot;, of length formula_9
*formula_10 is &quot;DFT-symmetric&quot;, of length formula_11

*The parameter B displayed on each spectral plot is the function&#x27;s noise equivalent bandwidth metric, in units of &quot;DFT bins&quot;.
**See and Normalized frequency for understanding the use of &quot;bins&quot; for the x-axis in these plots.

The sparse sampling of a discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) such as the DFTs in Fig 2 only reveals the leakage into the DFT bins from a sinusoid whose frequency is also an integer DFT bin. The unseen sidelobes reveal the leakage to expect from sinusoids at other frequencies. Therefore, when choosing a window function, it is usually important to sample the DTFT more densely (as we do throughout this section) and choose a window that suppresses the sidelobes to an acceptable level.

=== Rectangular window ===

The rectangular window (sometimes known as the boxcar or uniform or Dirichlet window or misleadingly as &quot;no window&quot; in some programs) is the simplest window, equivalent to replacing all but &quot;N&quot; consecutive values of a data sequence by zeros, making the waveform suddenly turn on and off:

:formula_12

Other windows are designed to moderate these sudden changes, to reduce scalloping loss and improve dynamic range (described in ).

The rectangular window is the 1st-order &quot;B&quot;-spline window as well as the 0th-power power-of-sine window.

The rectangular window provides the minimum mean square error estimate of the Discrete-time Fourier transform, at the cost of other issues discussed.

=== &quot;B&quot;-spline windows ===

&quot;B&quot;-spline windows can be obtained as &quot;k&quot;-fold convolutions of the rectangular window. They include the rectangular window itself (&quot;k&quot; = 1), the (&quot;k&quot; = 2) and the (&quot;k&quot; = 4). Alternative definitions sample the appropriate normalized &quot;B&quot;-spline basis functions instead of convolving discrete-time windows. A &quot;k&quot;th-order &quot;B&quot;-spline basis function is a piece-wise polynomial function of degree &quot;k&quot; − 1 that is obtained by &quot;k&quot;-fold self-convolution of the rectangular function.
==== Triangular window ====
Triangular windows are given by

:formula_13

where &quot;L&quot; can be &quot;N&quot;, &quot;N&quot; + 1, or &quot;N&quot; + 2. The first one is also known as Bartlett window or Fejér window. All three definitions converge at large &quot;N&quot;.

The triangular window is the 2nd-order &quot;B&quot;-spline window. The &quot;L&quot; = &quot;N&quot; form can be seen as the convolution of two -width rectangular windows. The Fourier transform of the result is the squared values of the transform of the half-width rectangular window.
==== Parzen window ====

Defining , the Parzen window, also known as the de la Vallée Poussin window, is the 4th-order &quot;B&quot;-spline window given by

:formula_14
:formula_15

=== Other polynomial windows ===
==== Welch window ====

The Welch window consists of a single parabolic section:

:formula_16

The defining quadratic polynomial reaches a value of zero at the samples just outside the span of the window.

=== Sine window ===
:formula_17

The corresponding formula_18 function is a cosine without the /2 phase offset. So the &quot;sine window&quot; is sometimes also called &quot;cosine window&quot;. As it represents half a cycle of a sinusoidal function, it is also known variably as &quot;half-sine window&quot; or &quot;half-cosine window&quot;.

The autocorrelation of a sine window produces a function known as the Bohman window.

==== Power-of-sine/cosine windows ====

These window functions have the form:

:formula_19

The rectangular window (), the sine window (), and the Hann window () are members of this family.

For even-integer values of these functions can also be expressed in cosine-sum form:

: formula_20
: formula_21

=== Cosine-sum windows ===
This family is also known as &quot;generalized cosine windows&quot;.

In most cases, including the examples below, all coefficients &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot; ≥ 0. These windows have only 2&quot;K&quot; + 1 non-zero &quot;N&quot;-point DFT coefficients.

==== Hann and Hamming windows ====


The customary cosine-sum windows for case &quot;K&quot; = 1 have the form

:formula_22

which is easily (and often) confused with its zero-phase version:

:formula_23

Setting formula_24 produces a Hann window:

:formula_25

named after Julius von Hann, and sometimes erroneously referred to as &quot;Hanning&quot;, presumably due to its linguistic and formulaic similarities to the Hamming window. It is also known as raised cosine, because the zero-phase version, formula_26 is one lobe of an elevated cosine function.

This function is a member of both the cosine-sum and power-of-sine families. Unlike the Hamming window, the end points of the Hann window just touch zero. The resulting side-lobes roll off at about 18 dB per octave.

Setting formula_27 to approximately 0.54, or more precisely 25/46, produces the Hamming window, proposed by Richard W. Hamming. This choice places a zero crossing at frequency 5/(&quot;N&quot; − 1), which cancels the first sidelobe of the Hann window, giving it a height of about one-fifth that of the Hann window.
The Hamming window is often called the Hamming blip when used for pulse shaping.

Approximation of the coefficients to two decimal places substantially lowers the level of sidelobes, to a nearly equiripple condition. In the equiripple sense, the optimal values for the coefficients are &quot;a&quot;0 = 0.53836 and &quot;a&quot;1 = 0.46164.

==== Blackman window ====
Blackman windows are defined as
:formula_28

:formula_29

By common convention, the unqualified term &quot;Blackman window&quot; refers to Blackman&#x27;s &quot;not very serious proposal&quot; of (&quot;a&quot;0 = 0.42, &quot;a&quot;1 = 0.5, &quot;a&quot;2 = 0.08), which closely approximates the exact Blackman, with &quot;a&quot;0 = 7938/18608 ≈ 0.42659, &quot;a&quot;1 = 9240/18608 ≈ 0.49656, and &quot;a&quot;2 = 1430/18608 ≈ 0.076849. These exact values place zeros at the third and fourth sidelobes, but result in a discontinuity at the edges and a 6 dB/oct fall-off. The truncated coefficients do not null the sidelobes as well, but have an improved 18 dB/oct fall-off.
==== Nuttall window, continuous first derivative ====
The continuous form of the Nuttall window, formula_30 and its first derivative are continuous everywhere, like the Hann function. That is, the function goes to 0 at unlike the Blackman–Nuttall, Blackman–Harris, and Hamming windows. The Blackman window () is also continuous with continuous derivative at the edge, but the &quot;exact Blackman window&quot; is not.

:formula_31

:formula_32
==== Blackman–Nuttall window ====
:formula_31

:formula_34
==== Blackman–Harris window ====
A generalization of the Hamming family, produced by adding more shifted sinc functions, meant to minimize side-lobe levels

:formula_31

:formula_36
==== Flat top window ====
A flat top window is a partially negative-valued window that has minimal scalloping loss in the frequency domain. That property is desirable for the measurement of amplitudes of sinusoidal frequency components. However, its broad bandwidth results in high noise bandwidth and wider frequency selection, which depending on the application could be a drawback.

Flat top windows can be designed using low-pass filter design methods, or they may be of the usual cosine-sum variety:

:formula_37

The Matlab variant has these coefficients:
:formula_38

Other variations are available, such as sidelobes that roll off at the cost of higher values near the main lobe.
==== Rife–Vincent windows ====

Rife–Vincent windows are customarily scaled for unity average value, instead of unity peak value. The coefficient values below, applied to , reflect that custom.

Class I, Order 1 (&quot;K&quot; = 1): formula_39 Functionally equivalent to the Hann window.

Class I, Order 2 (&quot;K&quot; = 2): formula_40

Class I is defined by minimizing the high-order sidelobe amplitude. Coefficients for orders up to K=4 are tabulated.

Class II minimizes the main-lobe width for a given maximum side-lobe.

Class III is a compromise for which order &quot;K&quot; = 2 resembles the .

=== Adjustable windows ===

==== Gaussian window ====

The Fourier transform of a Gaussian is also a Gaussian. Since the support of a Gaussian function extends to infinity, it must either be truncated at the ends of the window, or itself windowed with another zero-ended window.

Since the log of a Gaussian produces a parabola, this can be used for nearly exact quadratic interpolation in frequency estimation.

:formula_41
:formula_42

The standard deviation of the Gaussian function is &quot;σ&quot; · &quot;N&quot;/2 sampling periods.


==== Confined Gaussian window ====
The confined Gaussian window yields the smallest possible root mean square frequency width for a given temporal width . These windows optimize the RMS time-frequency bandwidth products. They are computed as the minimum eigenvectors of a parameter-dependent matrix. The confined Gaussian window family contains the and the in the limiting cases of large and small , respectively.


==== Approximate confined Gaussian window ====

Defining , a confined Gaussian window of temporal width is well approximated by:

:formula_43

where formula_44 is a Gaussian function:

::formula_45

The standard deviation of the approximate window is asymptotically equal (i.e. large values of ) to for .
==== Generalized normal window ====
A more generalized version of the Gaussian window is the generalized normal window. Retaining the notation from the Gaussian window above, we can represent this window as

:formula_46

for any even formula_47. At formula_48, this is a Gaussian window and as formula_47 approaches formula_50, this approximates to a rectangular window. The Fourier transform of this window does not exist in a closed form for a general formula_47. However, it demonstrates the other benefits of being smooth, adjustable bandwidth. Like the , this window naturally offers a &quot;flat top&quot; to control the amplitude attenuation of a time-series (on which we don&#x27;t have a control with Gaussian window). In essence, it offers a good (controllable) compromise, in terms of spectral leakage, frequency resolution and amplitude attenuation, between the Gaussian window and the rectangular window.
See also for a study on time-frequency representation of this window (or function).

==== Tukey window ====
The Tukey window, also known as the &quot;cosine-tapered window&quot;, can be regarded as a cosine lobe of width (spanning observations) that is convolved with a rectangular window of width .
:formula_52 
At it becomes rectangular, and at it becomes a Hann window.
==== Planck-taper window ====
The so-called &quot;Planck-taper&quot; window is a bump function that has been widely used in the theory of partitions of unity in manifolds. It is smooth (a formula_53 function) everywhere, but is exactly zero outside of a compact region, exactly one over an interval within that region, and varies smoothly and monotonically between those limits. Its use as a window function in signal processing was first suggested in the context of gravitational-wave astronomy, inspired by the Planck distribution. It is defined as a piecewise function:
:formula_54

The amount of tapering is controlled by the parameter &quot;ε&quot;, with smaller values giving sharper transitions.

==== DPSS or Slepian window ====

The DPSS (discrete prolate spheroidal sequence) or Slepian window maximizes the energy concentration in the main lobe, and is used in multitaper spectral analysis, which averages out noise in the spectrum and reduces information loss at the edges of the window.

The main lobe ends at a frequency bin given by the parameter &quot;α&quot;.

The Kaiser windows below are created by a simple approximation to the DPSS windows:
==== Kaiser window ====
The Kaiser, or Kaiser–Bessel, window is a simple approximation of the DPSS window using Bessel functions, discovered by James Kaiser.

:formula_55 
:formula_56

where formula_57 is the 0-order modified Bessel function of the first kind. Variable parameter formula_58 determines the tradeoff between main lobe width and side lobe levels of the spectral leakage pattern. The main lobe width, in between the nulls, is given by formula_59 in units of DFT bins, and a typical value of formula_58 is 3.

==== Dolph–Chebyshev window ====
Minimizes the Chebyshev norm of the side-lobes for a given main lobe width.

The zero-phase Dolph–Chebyshev window function formula_61 is usually defined in terms of its real-valued discrete Fourier transform, formula_62:

:formula_63

&quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the &quot;n&quot;-th Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind evaluated in &quot;x&quot;, which can be computed using

:formula_64

and

:formula_65

is the unique positive real solution to formula_66, where the parameter &quot;α&quot; sets the Chebyshev norm of the sidelobes to −20&quot;α&quot; decibels.

The window function can be calculated from &quot;W&quot;0(&quot;k&quot;) by an inverse discrete Fourier transform (DFT):

:formula_67

The &quot;lagged&quot; version of the window can be obtained by:

:formula_68

which for even values of &quot;N&quot; must be computed as follows:

:formula_69

which is an inverse DFT of formula_70

Variations:
*Due to the equiripple condition, the time-domain window has discontinuities at the edges. An approximation that avoids them, by allowing the equiripples to drop off at the edges, is a Taylor window.
*An alternative to the inverse DFT definition is also available..
==== Ultraspherical window ====
The Ultraspherical window was introduced in 1984 by Roy Streit and has application in antenna array design, non-recursive filter design, and spectrum analysis.

Like other adjustable windows, the Ultraspherical window has parameters that can be used to control its Fourier transform main-lobe width and relative side-lobe amplitude. Uncommon to other windows, it has an additional parameter which can be used to set the rate at which side-lobes decrease (or increase) in amplitude.

The window can be expressed in the time-domain as follows:

:formula_71

where formula_72 is the Ultraspherical polynomial of degree N, and formula_73 and formula_74 control the side-lobe patterns.

Certain specific values of formula_74 yield other well-known windows: formula_76 and formula_77 give the Dolph–Chebyshev and Saramäki windows respectively. See here for illustration of Ultraspherical windows with varied parametrization.
==== Exponential or Poisson window ====

The Poisson window, or more generically the exponential window increases exponentially towards the center of the window and decreases exponentially in the second half. Since the exponential function never reaches zero, the values of the window at its limits are non-zero (it can be seen as the multiplication of an exponential function by a rectangular window ). It is defined by

:formula_78

where &quot;τ&quot; is the time constant of the function. The exponential function decays as &quot;e&quot; ≃ 2.71828 or approximately 8.69 dB per time constant.
This means that for a targeted decay of &quot;D&quot; dB over half of the window length, the time constant &quot;τ&quot; is given by

:formula_79
=== Hybrid windows ===

Window functions have also been constructed as multiplicative or additive combinations of other windows.

==== Bartlett–Hann window ====

:formula_80

:formula_81
==== Planck–Bessel window ====

A multiplied by a Kaiser window which is defined in terms of a modified Bessel function. This hybrid window function was introduced to decrease the peak side-lobe level of the Planck-taper window while still exploiting its good asymptotic decay. It has two tunable parameters, &quot;ε&quot; from the Planck-taper and &quot;α&quot; from the Kaiser window, so it can be adjusted to fit the requirements of a given signal.

==== Hann–Poisson window ====

A Hann window multiplied by a Poisson window. For formula_82 it has no side-lobes, as its Fourier transform drops off forever away from the main lobe without local minima. It can thus be used in hill climbing algorithms like Newton&#x27;s method. The Hann–Poisson window is defined by:

:formula_83

where &quot;α&quot; is a parameter that controls the slope of the exponential.
=== Other windows ===

==== Generalized adaptive polynomial (GAP) window ====

The GAP window is a family of adjustable window functions that are based on a symmetrical polynomial expansion of order formula_84. It is continuous with continuous derivative everywhere. With the appropriate set of expansion coefficients and expansion order, the GAP window can mimic all the known window functions, reproducing accurately their spectral properties.

:formula_85 

where formula_86 is the standard deviation of the formula_87 sequence.

Additionally, starting with a set of expansion coefficients formula_88 that mimics a certain known window function, the GAP window can be optimized by minimization procedures to get a new set of coefficients that improve one or more spectral properties, such as the main lobe width, side lobe attenuation, and side lobe falloff rate. Therefore, a GAP window function can be developed with designed spectral properties depending on the specific application.

==== Lanczos window ====
formula_89

* used in Lanczos resampling
* for the Lanczos window, formula_90 is defined as formula_91
* also known as a &quot;sinc window&quot;, because: formula_92 is the main lobe of a normalized sinc function
=== Asymmetric window functions ===
The formula_4 form, according to the convention above, is symmetric around formula_94. However, there are window functions that are asymmetric, such as the Gamma distribution used in FIR implementations of Gammatone filters. These asymmetries are used to reduce the delay when using large window sizes, or to emphasize the initial transient of a decaying pulse.

Any bounded function with compact support, including asymmetric ones, can be readily used as a window function. Additionally, there are ways to transform symmetric windows into asymmetric windows by transforming the time coordinate, such as with the below formula

:formula_95

where the window weights more highly the earliest samples when formula_96, and conversely weights more highly the latest samples when formula_97.

<text>Black Entertainment Television (BET) is an American basic cable channel targeting Black American audiences. It is the flagship channel of the BET Media Group, a subsidiary of Paramount Global&#x27;s CBS Entertainment Group. Originally launched as a USA Network programming block on January 25, 1980, BET would eventually become a full-fledged channel on July 1, 1983. 

, BET is available to approximately 67,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2011 peak of 92,000,000 households.

== History ==
=== Early years ===

After stepping down as a lobbyist for the cable industry, Freeport, Illinois native Robert L. Johnson decided to launch his own cable television network. Johnson acquired a loan for $15,000 (equivalent to $55,648 in 2023) and a $500,000 (equivalent to $1,854,921 in 2023) investment from media executive John Malone to start the network. The network, which was named Black Entertainment Television (BET), launched on January 25, 1980. Cheryl D. Miller designed the logo that would represent the network, which featured a star to symbolize &quot;Black Star Power&quot;.

Initially, broadcasting for two hours a week as a block of programming on the Madison Square Garden Sports Network (which would change their name to USA Network three months after BET launched), the network&#x27;s lineup was composed of music videos and reruns of popular black sitcoms.

=== Becoming a full-time channel ===
In 1983, BET became a full-fledged entity, independent of any other channel or programming block, though continuing to share channel space with other cable networks on local cable systems due to lack of channel room for their 24-hour schedule until the time of digital cable allowed for larger channel capacity. In some markets, the network would not arrive at all until as late as the early 2010s and Viacom considered it compulsory in retransmission consent negotiations to carry the BET-branded networks with Viacom Media Networks, due to some providers claiming that there was an overall lack of demand for the channel, or excused their lack of interest in BET due to an alleged low to non-existent Black American population within their service area.

BET launched a news program, &quot;BET News&quot;, in 1986, with Paul Berry as its first anchor. Berry was also a local anchor at WJLA-TV in Washington, DC at that time. Ed Gordon became anchor in 1988. Gordon later hosted other programs and specials on BET, such as &quot;For Black Men Only: The Aftermath&quot;, related to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, and a recurring interview show, &quot;Conversations with Ed Gordon&quot;. In 1996, the talk show &quot;BET Tonight&quot; started with Tavis Smiley as host; in 2001, Ed Gordon replaced Smiley as host of the program.

In 1991, the network became the first black-controlled television company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Starting the late 1990s, the network expanded with the launch of digital cable networks: what is now the general interest channel BET Her was initially launched as &quot;BET on Jazz&quot; (later known as &quot;BET Jazz&quot;, &quot;BET J&quot;, and &quot;Centric&quot;), created initially to showcase jazz music-related programming, especially that of black American jazz musicians. In 1997, BET entered into a joint venture with Starz (then-owned by John Malone&#x27;s Liberty Media, but later acquired by Lionsgate years later) to launch a multiplex service of the premium channel featuring black American-oriented films called &quot;BET Movies: Starz! 3&quot; (later renamed &quot;Black Starz&quot; after BET dropped out of the venture following its purchase by Viacom, then-owner of Starz rival Showtime, and now known as &quot;Starz InBlack&quot;).

=== Sale to Viacom/Paramount ===
In 2000, media conglomerate Viacom (later to become part of Paramount Global) purchased BET for $2.3 billion. In 2005, Johnson retired from the network, turning over his titles of president and chief executive officer to former BET vice president Debra L. Lee.

In 2002, the network had launched two more music-oriented networks: BET Hip-Hop and BET Gospel. BET also launched a series of original programming by this time, including reality shows &quot;Baldwin Hills&quot; and &quot;Hell Date&quot;, competition show &quot;Sunday Best&quot;, and town hall-style discussion show &quot;Hip Hop vs. America&quot;. BET&#x27;s president of entertainment Reginald Hudlin resigned from the network on September 11, 2008. He was then replaced by Stephen Hill, who is also executive vice president of music programming and talent. BET announced in March 2010 that Ed Gordon would return to the network to host &quot;a variety of news programs and specials&quot;.

In March 2017, president of programming Stephen Hill and executive vice president of original programming Zola Mashariki both stepped down. Connie Orlando, senior vice president of Specials, Music Programming, and News was named the interim president of programming.

In July 2017, Viacom signed new film and television development deals with Academy Award winner Tyler Perry following the expiration of his existing pact with Discovery Inc. in 2019. As part of this deal, Perry would produce &quot;The Oval&quot; and &quot;Sistas&quot; for BET and co-own the network&#x27;s newly launched streaming service, BET+.

== Programming ==
== Criticism ==
A wide range of people have protested elements of BET&#x27;s programming and actions, including Public Enemy rapper Chuck D, journalist George Curry, writer Keith Boykin, comic book creator Christopher Priest, filmmaker Spike Lee, Syracuse University professor of finance Dr. Boyce Watkins, former NFL player Burgess Owens, and cartoonist Aaron McGruder (who, in addition to numerous critical references throughout his series &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, made two particular episodes, &quot;The Hunger Strike&quot; and &quot;The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show&quot;, criticizing the channel). As a result, BET heavily censors suggestive content from the videos that it airs, often with entire verses and scenes removed from certain rap videos.

Many scholars within the black American community maintain that BET perpetuates and justifies racism by affecting the stereotypes held about black Americans, and also by affecting the psyche of its young viewers through its bombardment of negative images of black Americans.

Following the death of civil rights leader Coretta Scott King in 2006, BET broadcast its regularly scheduled music video programming, rather than covering King&#x27;s funeral live, as was done by TV One and Black Family Channel, and by cable news channels such as CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC. The network&#x27;s website streamed the funeral live, while it periodically broadcast taped, 60-second reports from the funeral by senior news correspondent Andre Showell. Michael Lewellen, BET&#x27;s senior vice president for corporate communications, defended the decision: &quot;We weighed a number of different options. In the end, we chose to offer a different kind of experience for BET viewers.&quot; Lewellen also explained that BET received around &quot;two dozen&quot; phone calls and &quot;a handful&quot; of emails criticizing BET for not showing the King funeral live. On the evening of the funeral, February 7, 2006, BET broadcast the tribute special &quot;Coretta Scott King: Married to the Mission&quot;, and repeated it the following Sunday, February 12. Showell hosted the program featuring highlights of the funeral, &quot;Coretta Scott King: Celebrating Her Spirit&quot;, that broadcast that same day. In its 2007 convention, the National Association of Black Journalists gave BET its &quot;Thumbs Down Award&quot; for not broadcasting King&#x27;s funeral live.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the Reverend Delman L. Coates and his organization Enough is Enough led protests every weekend outside the residences of BET executives against what they claim are negative stereotypes of black people perpetuated by BET music videos. Enough is Enough backed an April 2008 report titled &quot;The Rap on Rap&quot; by the Parents Television Council that criticized BET&#x27;s rap programming, suggesting that the gratuitous sexual, violent and profane content was targeting children and teens.

In a 2010 interview, BET co-founder Sheila Johnson explained that she herself is &quot;ashamed&quot; of what the network has become. &quot;I don&#x27;t watch it. I suggest to my kids that they don&#x27;t watch it,&quot; she said. &quot;When we started BET, it was going to be the &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine on television. We had public affairs programming. We had news... I had a show called &quot;Teen Summit&quot;, we had a large variety of programming, but the problem is that then the video revolution started up... And then something started happening, and I didn&#x27;t like it at all. And I remember during those days we would sit up and watch these videos and decide which ones were going on and which ones were not. We got a lot of backlash from recording artists...and we had to start showing them. I didn&#x27;t like the way women were being portrayed in these videos.&quot;

== Sister networks ==
=== Spin-off channels ===
BET has launched several spin-off cable networks over the years, including BET Her (formerly known as &quot;BET on Jazz&quot;, then &quot;BET J&quot; and later &quot;Centric&quot;), BET Hip-Hop, and BET Gospel. Overtime, spin-offs from sibling channels would be realigned under the BET branding; such as BET Jams (formerly known as &quot;MTV Jams&quot;), BET Soul (formerly known as &quot;VH1 Soul&quot;), SHO×BET, a premium Showtime multiplex network, and VH1 (an older-skewing spin-off of MTV that drifted into reality shows and, later, Black American-centric programming).

In May 2019, a BET-branded channel was launched on Pluto TV (which was acquired by its parent company two months earlier). In June 2019, the launch of BET+ was announced, a premium streaming service targeting Black Americans. The service launched in the United States in Fall 2019 with &quot;First Wives Club&quot; (which was originally planned to launch on Paramount Network before being shifted to BET) announced as one of the service&#x27;s original series.

==== BET Gospel ====

BET Gospel is a television network in the United States that launched on July 1, 2002. The network provides gospel and religious-related programming, and much of its time is paid for by religious organizations to carry their programming and services.

==== BET Jams ====
BET Jams is an American pay television network airing hip-hop and urban contemporary music videos on a thrice-daily automated wheel schedule of eight hours outside of temporary &quot;roadblock&quot; closures during Paramount Global&#x27;s awards events, with all of its programming currently denoted in hour blocks as &quot;BET Jams – Music Videos&quot; within electronic program guide listings.

The channel launched on May 1, 2002, as MTV Jams, and carried that name until October 5, 2015, and was placed under BET&#x27;s purview as MTV drifted away from music programming along with &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot;. The network space itself launched on August 1, 1998, as MTVX, carrying modern rock videos, and was re-focused around hip-hop music on that date, to some controversy from MTVX&#x27;s former viewers.

=== International networks ===
==== BET International ====

BET UK first transmitted on Videotron (now known as Virgin Media) and several other subscription providers from 1993 until 1996.

In May 2007 by Ofcom, BET International Inc. was given a license to rebroadcast in the United Kingdom. BET International is the first international version of the channel and is available in Europe, Africa and the Middle East through satellite providers. BET launched on February 27, 2008, on Sky channel 191 and began to be carried by Freesat channel 140 on August 8, 2008. BET+1 is also available on Sky channel 198 and Freesat channel 141, and is free-to-air. BET International shows with a mix of content from the main BET channel and locally produced shows. An exclusive, but temporary, HD version of the channel was made to show the 2009 BET Awards on Freesat EPG 142.

BET is additionally an associate member of the Caribbean Cable Cooperative.

BET launched an app called BET Play allowing international access to BET content in over 100 countries in June 2016.

The channel was shut down on April 8, 2021, with its content moved to My5 and Pluto TV.

==== Canada ====
BET became available through most Canadian pay television providers on October 17, 1997, though with select programming substituted and blacked out due to domestic broadcast groups owning the rights the shows being broadcast and carrying them on another of their networks.

In 2022, Paramount began to phase out BET in Canada due to expiring rights, a number of major providers began dropping the channel, beginning with Rogers Communications on April 1, 2022, followed by Hay Communications on September 30, 2022, and Shaw Cable and Shaw Direct on August 31, 2023. The Canadian feed was discontinued on all other providers nationwide on January 1, 2025.

==== France ====

Introduced on November 17, 2015. BET France launched across a linear television channel alongside non-linear services including Bouygues Telecom, Canalsat, Numericable/SFR, and Free.

<text>The Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy, also known as the Rocket Richard Trophy, is awarded annually to the leading goal scorer in the National Hockey League (NHL). It was donated to the NHL by the Montreal Canadiens in and is named in honour of legendary Montreal Canadiens right winger Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard. First won by Teemu Selanne, it is currently held by Auston Matthews, who scored 69 goals during the 2023–24 NHL season.

==History==

The Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy was donated by the Montreal Canadiens to the NHL in 1999, and was first awarded at the end of the . It is one of the newest of the NHL&#x27;s trophies and is named in honour of the legendary right winger Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard, who spent his eighteen-season career with the Canadiens. He led the NHL in goal scoring five times and was the first NHL player to reach the 500-goal milestone. In , Richard became the first player in NHL history to score 50 goals in one season, doing so in just 50 games, the latter feat achieved by only four other players since then. However, Richard never finished higher than second in points, his closest miss coming in , when he finished one point behind teammate Bernie Geoffrion.

The winner of the Art Ross Trophy, given to the NHL&#x27;s leading points scorer, often also wins the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s most valuable player. In contrast, only Auston Matthews, Alexander Ovechkin, Corey Perry, and Connor McDavid have won both the Richard and the Hart trophies in the same season; Ovechkin has accomplished this three times, in , , and . Eleven players won the Hart in the same season in which they led the league in goals before the Richard Trophy was first awarded. McDavid and Ovechkin are the only two player to have won the Hart, Rocket Richard, Art Ross and Ted Lindsay trophy in the same season.

Unlike the Art Ross Trophy, there are no tiebreakers for the Richard Trophy. As a result, it is possible for several players to share the award, such as when the season featured a three-way tie between 41-goal scorers Jarome Iginla, Ilya Kovalchuk, and Rick Nash. The second time there was a tie for this award was in the season, when both Sidney Crosby and Steven Stamkos scored 51 goals each to win this award. In the shortened season, there was a tie between Ovechkin and David Pastrnak, though Ovechkin played in two fewer games than Pastrnak. Rick Nash is the youngest player to have won the trophy, being 19 years old upon receipt. 

Auston Matthews (third Richard Trophy in ) and Alexander Ovechkin (ninth Richard Trophy in ) are the only players to have won the trophy at least three times. Only four other players (Pavel Bure, Sidney Crosby, Jarome Iginla, and Steven Stamkos, with two trophies each) have won it more than once.

<doc id="244103" wikidata="Q1682583" url="?curid=244103" title="Tendinopathy">
<text>Tendinopathy is a type of tendon disorder that results in pain, swelling, and impaired function. The pain is typically worse with movement. It most commonly occurs around the shoulder (rotator cuff tendinitis, biceps tendinitis), elbow (tennis elbow, golfer&#x27;s elbow), wrist, hip, knee (jumper&#x27;s knee, popliteus tendinopathy), or ankle (Achilles tendinitis).
Causes may include an injury or repetitive activities. Less common causes include infection, arthritis, gout, thyroid disease, diabetes and the use of quinolone antibiotic medicines. Groups at risk include people who do manual labor, musicians, and athletes. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms, examination, and occasionally medical imaging. A few weeks following an injury little inflammation remains, with the underlying problem related to weak or disrupted tendon fibrils.
Treatment may include rest, NSAIDs, splinting, and physiotherapy. Less commonly steroid injections or surgery may be done. About 80% of overuse tendinopathy patients recover completely within six months. Tendinopathy is relatively common. Older people are more commonly affected. It results in a large amount of missed work.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms include tenderness on palpation, swelling, and pain, often when exercising or with a specific movement.

==Cause==
Causes may include an injury or repetitive activities. Groups at risk include people who do manual labor, musicians, and athletes. Less common causes include infection, arthritis, gout, thyroid disease, and diabetes. Successful treatments include rehabilitation therapy and/or surgery. Obesity, or more specifically, adiposity or fatness, has also been linked to an increasing incidence of tendinopathy.

Quinolone antibiotics are associated with increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture. A 2013 review found the incidence of tendon injury among those taking fluoroquinolones to be between 0.08 and 0.2%. Fluoroquinolones most frequently affect large load-bearing tendons in the lower limb, especially the Achilles tendon which ruptures in approximately 30 to 40% of cases.

===Types===
Examples include:

* Achilles tendinitis
* Calcific tendinitis
* Patellar tendinitis (jumper&#x27;s knee)

==Pathophysiology==
As of 2016, the pathophysiology of tendinopathy is poorly understood. While inflammation appears to play a role, the relationships among changes to the structure of tissue, the function of tendons, and pain are not understood and there are several competing models, none of which have been fully validated or falsified. Molecular mechanisms involved in inflammation includes release of inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β which reduces the expression of type I collagen mRNA in human tenocytes and causes extracellular matrix degradation in the tendon. In a 2020 systematic review, it was noted that while various inflammatory markers were present in two thirds of the reviewed articles, the heterogenicity of data and lack of comparable studies meant no conclusion about a common pathophysiology from this systematic review.

There are multifactorial theories that could include: tensile overload, tenocyte related collagen synthesis disruption, load-induced ischemia, neural sprouting, thermal damage, and adaptive compressive responses. The intratendinous sliding motion of fascicles and shear force at interfaces of fascicles could be an important mechanical factor for the development of tendinopathy and predispose tendons to rupture.

The most commonly accepted cause for this condition is seen to be an overuse syndrome in combination with intrinsic and extrinsic factors leading to what may be seen as a progressive interference or the failing of the innate healing response. Tendinopathy involves cellular apoptosis, matrix disorganization and neovascularization.

Classic characteristics of &quot;tendinosis&quot; include degenerative changes in the collagenous matrix, hypercellularity, hypervascularity, and a lack of inflammatory cells which has challenged the original misnomer &quot;tendinitis&quot;.

For chronic tennis elbow, histological findings include granulation tissue, microrupture, degenerative changes, and there is no traditional inflammation. As a consequence, &quot;lateral elbow tendinopathy or tendinosis&quot; is used instead of &quot;lateral epicondylitis&quot;.
Examination of pathologic tennis elbow tissue reveals noninflammatory tissue, so the term &quot;angiofibroblastic tendinosis&quot; is also used.

Cultures from tendinopathic tendons contain an increased production of type III collagen.

Longitudinal sonogram of the lateral elbow displays thickening and heterogeneity of the common extensor tendon that is consistent with tendinosis, as the ultrasound reveals calcifications, intrasubstance tears, and marked irregularity of the lateral epicondyle. Although the term &quot;epicondylitis&quot; is frequently used to describe this disorder, most histopathologic findings of studies have displayed no evidence of an acute, or a chronic inflammatory process. Histologic studies have demonstrated that this condition is the result of tendon degeneration, which causes normal tissue to be replaced by a disorganized arrangement of collagen. Therefore, the disorder is more appropriately referred to as &quot;tendinosis&quot; or &quot;tendinopathy&quot; rather than &quot;tendinitis&quot;.

Colour Doppler ultrasound reveals structural tendon changes, with vascularity and hypo-echoic areas that correspond to the areas of pain in the extensor origin.

Load-induced non-rupture tendinopathy in humans is associated with an increase in the ratio of collagen III:I proteins, a shift from large to small diameter collagen fibrils, buckling of the collagen fascicles in the tendon extracellular matrix, and buckling of the tenocyte cells and their nuclei.

== Diagnosis ==

Symptoms can vary from aches or pains and local joint stiffness, to a burning that surrounds the whole joint around the inflamed tendon. In some cases, swelling occurs along with heat and redness, and there may be visible knots surrounding the joint. With this condition, the pain is usually worse during and after activity, and the tendon and joint area can become stiff the following day as muscles tighten from the movement of the tendon. Many patients report stressful situations in their life in correlation with the beginnings of pain which may contribute to the symptoms.

=== Medical imaging ===

Ultrasound imaging can be used to evaluate tissue strain, as well as other mechanical properties. Ultrasound-based techniques are becoming more popular because of its affordability, safety, and speed. Ultrasound can be used for imaging tissues, and the sound waves can also provide information about the mechanical state of the tissue.

==Treatment==

Treatment of tendon injuries is largely conservative. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), rest, and gradual return to exercise is a common therapy. A meta-analysis revealed that exercise using weights or a resistance band is more effective than using bodyweight alone. In addition, having rest days is more effective than exercising every day. Resting assists in the prevention of further damage to the tendon. Ice, compression and elevation are also frequently recommended. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, orthotics or braces may also be useful. Initial recovery is typically within two to three days and full recovery is within three to six months. Tendinosis occurs as the acute phase of healing has ended (six to eight weeks) but has left the area insufficiently healed. Treatment of tendinitis helps reduce some of the risks of developing tendinosis, which takes longer to heal.

There is tentative evidence that low-level laser therapy may also be beneficial in treating tendinopathy. The effects of deep transverse friction massage for treating tennis elbow and lateral knee tendinitis is unclear.

===NSAIDs===
NSAIDs may be used to help with pain. They however do not alter long term outcomes. Other types of pain medication, like paracetamol (acetaminophen), may be just as useful.

===Steroids===
Steroid injections have not been shown to have long term benefits for tendonitis, but appear to improve pain and function in the short term more effectively than other treatments except NSAIDs. They appear to have little benefit in tendinitis of the rotator cuff. There are some concerns that they may have negative effects.

===Other injections===
There is insufficient evidence on the routine use of injection therapies (autologous blood, platelet-rich plasma, deproteinised haemodialysate, aprotinin, polysulphated glycosaminoglycan, skin derived fibroblasts etc.) for treating Achilles tendinopathy. As of 2014 there was insufficient evidence to support the use of platelet-rich therapies for treating musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries such as ligament, muscle and tendon tears and tendinopathies.

==Prognosis==
Initial recovery from overuse tendinosus is usually within two to three months, and 80% will recover fully within three to six months.

==Epidemiology==
Tendon injury and resulting tendinopathy are responsible for up to 30% of consultations to sports doctors and other musculoskeletal health providers. Tendinopathy is most often seen in tendons of athletes either before or after an injury but is becoming more common in non-athletes and sedentary populations. For example, the majority of patients with Achilles tendinopathy in a general population-based study did not associate their condition with a sporting activity. In another study the population incidence of Achilles tendinopathy increased sixfold from 1979–1986 to 1987–1994. The incidence of rotator cuff tendinopathy ranges from 0.3% to 5.5% and annual prevalence from 0.5% to 7.4%.

==Terminology==
Tendinitis is a very common, but misleading term. By definition, the suffix &quot;-itis&quot; means &quot;inflammation of&quot;. Inflammation is the body&#x27;s local response to tissue damage which involves red blood cells, white blood cells, blood proteins with dilation of blood vessels around the site of injury. Tendons are relatively avascular.
Corticosteroids are drugs that reduce inflammation. Corticosteroids can be useful to relieve chronic tendinopathy pain, improve function, and reduce swelling in the short term. However, there is a greater risk of long-term recurrence. They are typically injected along with a small amount of a numbing drug called lidocaine. Research shows that tendons are weaker following corticosteroid injections.

Tendinitis is still a very common diagnosis, though research increasingly documents that what is thought to be tendinitis is usually tendinosis.

Anatomically close but separate conditions are:
*Enthesitis, wherein there is inflammation of the entheses, the sites where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone. It is associated with HLA B27 arthropathies such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis.
*Apophysitis, inflammation of the bony attachment, generally associated with overuse among growing children.

==Research==

The use of a nitric oxide delivery system (glyceryl trinitrate patches) applied over the area of maximal tenderness was found to reduce pain and increase range of motion and strength.

A promising therapy involves eccentric loading exercises involving lengthening muscular contractions.

==Other animals==
Bowed tendon is a horseman&#x27;s term for tendinitis (inflammation) and tendinosis (degeneration), most commonly seen in the superficial digital flexor tendon in the front leg of horses.

Mesenchymal stem cells, derived from a horse&#x27;s bone marrow or fat, are currently being used for tendon repair in horses.

<doc id="244104" wikidata="Q464962" url="?curid=244104" title="Robert L. Johnson">
<text>Robert Louis Johnson (born April 8, 1946) is an American entrepreneur, media magnate, executive, philanthropist, and investor. He is the co-founder of BET, which was acquired by Viacom in 2001. He also founded RLJ Companies, a holding company that invests in various business sectors. Johnson is the former majority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats (now Charlotte Hornets). He became the first black American billionaire in 2001. Johnson&#x27;s companies have counted among the most prominent black American businesses in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.

==His early life &amp; Education==
Johnson was born in 1946 in Hickory, Mississippi, the ninth out of ten children to Edna and Archie Johnson. His mother was a schoolteacher and his father was a farmer. His parents moved the family to Freeport, Illinois, when he was a child. He was an honors student in high school. Johnson graduated from the University of Illinois in 1968 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in social studies. While at the University of Illinois, Johnson became a member of the Beta chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. He received a master&#x27;s degree in public affairs from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University in 1972.

==Career==
After graduating from Princeton, Johnson found a job in Washington, D.C., which introduced him to the television industry. He served as the public affairs director for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In this position is where he learned of the power and untapped potential of television. Around the same time he also worked as the director of communications for the Washington, D.C. office of the National Urban League. Johnson worked as a press secretary for Congressman Walter E. Fauntroy. He later became vice president of government relations at the National Cable and Television Association (NCTA). In 1980, Johnson launched Black Entertainment Television, which became a full-fledged channel in 1983.

Johnson left NCTA in 1979 to create Black Entertainment Television, the first cable television network aimed at black Americans. When the network launched in 1980, it only aired for two hours on Friday night. BET first turned a profit in 1985 and it became the first black-controlled company listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991. In 1998, Johnson and Liberty Media bought all outstanding shares of the company. This purchase gave Johnson 42% of the company. Viacom acquired BET in 2001 for a reported $3 billion; Johnson earned over $1 billion from the sale, making him the first black American billionaire. He remained BET CEO until 2006.

Johnson founded The RLJ Companies, a holding company with a diverse portfolio including hotel real estate investment, private equity, financial services, asset management, automobile dealerships, sports and entertainment, and Video lottery terminal gaming. The RLJ Companies is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland.

By January 2009, Ion Media had another subchannel network, Urban TV, in the works with him targeted to black Americans. Axiom Bank N.A. Maitland, Florida, was founded by Robert Johnson, who also founded the Black Entertainment Network (BET). As of 2013, Johnson was a member of the board of directors for RLJ Lodging Trust, RLJ Entertainment, Inc., KB Home, Lowe&#x27;s Companies, Inc., Strayer Education, Think Finance, Inc., NBA Board of Governors, The Business Council, and the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of African American History and Culture. Johnson has also served as a member of the board of directors for several other companies and organizations, including US Airways, Hilton Hotels, General Mills, the United Negro College Fund, and Deutsche Bank&#x27;s Americas Advisory Board.

Johnson became the first black American majority club owner of a major American sports league team with his 2002 purchase of the Charlotte Bobcats. In 2010, Johnson sold his majority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats to Michael Jordan.

It has been rumored that Johnson named the Bobcats after himself.

In 2016, Johnson finalized a partnership agreement with AMC Networks through his RLJ Company after launching his own video on demand streaming service Urban Movie Channel in 2014. According to the agreement, AMC will use its programming and distribution clout to benefit Acorn and UMC. Additionally, the RLJ-AMC partnership will allow for greater investment in content from black American creatives, Johnson emphasized. The agreement called for AMC to provide RLJ with a $60 million loan on a seven-year term and $5 million on a one-year term. AMC has received warrants to purchase at least 20 million shares or the equivalent of 50.1% of the company. The time frame for exercising those warrants is open-ended, AMC said.

==Philanthropy==
In 2011, Johnson worked with Morgan Freeman to raise funds for hurricane preparedness in the Bahamas. Johnson released a neckwear line in coordination with PVH and The Ella Rose Collection, the RLJ Ella Rose Africa Tie Collection, in 2012 to benefit the charitable organization Malaria No More.

In 2007, Johnson created the Liberia Enterprise Development Fund with a $30 million investment. The fund provides credit for Liberian entrepreneurs.

==Political activity==

=== Role in 2008 election ===
During the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Johnson was a prominent surrogate for Hillary Clinton&#x27;s presidential campaign. During the campaign, he was a &quot;HillRaiser&quot;, a term for a leading fundraiser for Clinton&#x27;s campaign. Following her defeat in the primary, Johnson wrote to members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), where he urged representatives to lobby Obama to select Clinton as his running mate.

==== January 2008 Obama remarks controversy ====
In January 2008, Johnson attracted controversy over remarks made about Barack Obama, Clinton&#x27;s primary rival, which were interpreted as a criticism of Obama&#x27;s admitted use of marijuana in his youth: 
The Clinton campaign denied that Johnson was referring to Obama&#x27;s past use of marijuana, stating that his comments were referring to Obama&#x27;s work as a community organizer. Critics accused Johnson of hypocrisy, given that BET has prominently featured artists that glorify drug use and distribution. On January 17, 2008, Johnson sent Obama the following apology: 

On April 14, 2008, Johnson made comments to the effect that Obama would not be the Democratic Party&#x27;s leading candidate if he were not black, in defense of a similar comment made by Geraldine Ferraro. He also went on to say &quot;I make a joke about Obama doing drugs [and it&#x27;s] &#x27;Oh my God, a black man tearing down another black man.&#x27;&quot; 

=== Political activity since 2016 ===

Following Donald Trump&#x27;s victory in the 2016 presidential election, Johnson met with the then-president-elect for a meeting at Trump International Golf Club. Johnson stated in a &quot;CNBC&quot; interview that he had known Trump personally for years, and urged Black Americans to give Trump a chance. Johnson argued that Black voters should not be wedded to either party in the American two-party system, stating that overwhelming Black support for the Democratic Party means &quot;we are locked into one party which undoubtedly limits and dilutes our voting power&quot;. In 2018, he stated that he declined an unspecified position in the Trump Administration. 

In 2019, Johnson praised Trump&#x27;s economic policies, stating that he &quot;[gives] the president a lot of credit for moving the economy in a positive direction that’s benefiting a large amount of Americans&quot;. He argued that tax cuts implemented under Trump helped stimulate the economy and inspire confidence among businesspeople. He stated that the Democratic Party moved too far to the left, and indicated he did not have a &quot;particular candidate&quot; he supported in the 2020 Democratic primary.

In September 2020, during the 2020 general election, Johnson made comments that were interpreted as him indicating a preference for Trump&#x27;s reelection candidacy over Joe Biden&#x27;s campaign. However, &quot;CNBC&quot; noted that &quot;Johnson, when pressed, refused to outright endorse Trump&quot;. During the interview, Johnson stated that &quot;[w]here I come out as a businessman, I will take the devil I know over the devil I don&#x27;t know anytime of the week.&quot;

==Personal life==
Johnson married Sheila Johnson in 1969. They divorced in 2001 and have two children. She is CEO of Salamander Hotels and Resorts and owner of Salamander Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club in Palm Harbor. Johnson began dating Lauren Wooden, who is 33 years his junior, in 2010. As of 2016, Wooden was pursuing an international business-management doctorate in Paris. They married in May 2016; Greg Mathis officiated, and divorced in 2020.

<doc id="244107" wikidata="Q172891" url="?curid=244107" title="Euclid's Elements">
<text>The Elements ( ) is a mathematical treatise consisting of 13 books attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid 300 BC. It is a collection of definitions, postulates, propositions (theorems and constructions), and mathematical proofs of the propositions. The books cover plane and solid Euclidean geometry, elementary number theory, and incommensurable lines. &quot;Elements&quot; is the oldest extant large-scale deductive treatment of mathematics. It has proven instrumental in the development of logic and modern science, and its logical rigor was not surpassed until the 19th century.

Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written. It was one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and has been estimated to be second only to the Bible in the number of editions published since the first printing in 1482, the number reaching well over one thousand. For centuries, when the quadrivium was included in the curriculum of all university students, knowledge of at least part of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; was required of all students. Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.

== History ==

===Basis in earlier work===

Scholars believe that the &quot;Elements&quot; is largely a compilation of propositions based on books by earlier Greek mathematicians.

Proclus (412–485 AD), a Greek mathematician who lived around seven centuries after Euclid, wrote in his commentary on the &quot;Elements&quot;: &quot;Euclid, who put together the &quot;Elements&quot;, collecting many of Eudoxus&#x27; theorems, perfecting many of Theaetetus&#x27;, and also bringing to irrefragable demonstration the things which were only somewhat loosely proved by his predecessors&quot;.

Pythagoras ( 570–495 BC) was probably the source for most of books I and II, Hippocrates of Chios ( 470–410 BC, not the better known Hippocrates of Kos) for book III, and Eudoxus of Cnidus ( 408–355 BC) for book V, while books IV, VI, XI, and XII probably came from other Pythagorean or Athenian mathematicians. The &quot;Elements&quot; may have been based on an earlier textbook by Hippocrates of Chios, who also may have originated the use of letters to refer to figures. Other similar works are also reported to have been written by Theudius of Magnesia, Leon, and Hermotimus of Colophon.

===Transmission of the text===
In the 4th century AD, Theon of Alexandria produced an edition of Euclid which was so widely used that it became the only surviving source until François Peyrard&#x27;s 1808 discovery at the Vatican of a manuscript not derived from Theon&#x27;s. This manuscript, the Heiberg manuscript, is from a Byzantine workshop around 900 and is the basis of modern editions. Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 29 is a tiny fragment of an even older manuscript, but only contains the statement of one proposition.

Although Euclid was known to Cicero, for instance, no record exists of the text having been translated into Latin prior to Boethius in the fifth or sixth century. The Arabs received the &quot;Elements&quot; from the Byzantines around 760; this version was translated into Arabic under Harun al-Rashid ( 800). The Byzantine scholar Arethas commissioned the copying of one of the extant Greek manuscripts of Euclid in the late ninth century. Although known in Byzantium, the &quot;Elements&quot; was lost to Western Europe until about 1120, when the English monk Adelard of Bath translated it into Latin from an Arabic translation. A relatively recent discovery was made of a Greek-to-Latin translation from the 12th century at Palermo, Sicily. The name of the translator is not known other than he was an anonymous medical student from Salerno who was visiting Palermo in order to translate the Almagest to Latin. The Euclid manuscript is extant and quite complete.

After the translation by Adelard of Bath (known as Adelard I), there was a flurry of translations from Arabic. Notable translators in this period include Herman of Carinthia who wrote an edition around 1140, Robert of Chester (his manuscripts are referred to collectively as Adelard II, written on or before 1251), Johannes de Tinemue, possibly also known as John of Tynemouth (his manuscripts are referred to collectively as Adelard III), late 12th century, and Gerard of Cremona (sometime after 1120 but before 1187). The exact details concerning these translations is still an active area of research. Campanus of Novara relied heavily on these Arabic translations to create his edition (sometime before 1260) which ultimately came to dominate Latin editions until the availability of Greek manuscripts in the 16th century. There are more than 100 pre-1482 Campanus manuscripts still available today.

 The first printed edition appeared in 1482 (based on Campanus&#x27;s translation), and since then it has been translated into many languages and published in about a thousand different editions. Theon&#x27;s Greek edition was recovered and published in 1533 based on Paris gr. 2343 and Venetus Marcianus 301. In 1570, John Dee provided a widely respected &quot;Mathematical Preface&quot;, along with copious notes and supplementary material, to the first English edition by Henry Billingsley.

Copies of the Greek text still exist, some of which can be found in the Vatican Library and the Bodleian Library in Oxford. The manuscripts available are of variable quality, and invariably incomplete. By careful analysis of the translations and originals, hypotheses have been made about the contents of the original text (copies of which are no longer available).

Ancient texts which refer to the &quot;Elements&quot; itself, and to other mathematical theories that were current at the time it was written, are also important in this process. Such analyses are conducted by J. L. Heiberg and Sir Thomas Little Heath in their editions of the text.

Also of importance are the scholia, or annotations to the text. These additions, which often distinguished themselves from the main text (depending on the manuscript), gradually accumulated over time as opinions varied upon what was worthy of explanation or further study.

== Contents ==
* Book 1 contains 5 postulates and 5 common notions, and covers important topics of plane geometry such as the Pythagorean theorem, equality of angles and areas, parallelism, the sum of the angles in a triangle, and the construction of various geometric figures.
* Book 2 contains a number of lemmas concerning the equality of rectangles and squares, sometimes referred to as &quot;geometric algebra&quot;, and concludes with a construction of the golden ratio and a way of constructing a square equal in area to any rectilineal plane figure.
* Book 3 deals with circles and their properties: finding the center, inscribed angles, tangents, the power of a point, Thales&#x27; theorem.
* Book 4 constructs the incircle and circumcircle of a triangle, as well as regular polygons with 4, 5, 6, and 15 sides.
* Book 5, on proportions of magnitudes, gives the highly sophisticated theory of proportion probably developed by Eudoxus, and proves properties such as &quot;alternation&quot; (if &quot;a&quot; : &quot;b&quot; :: &quot;c&quot; : &quot;d&quot;, then &quot;a&quot; : &quot;c&quot; :: &quot;b&quot; : &quot;d&quot;).
* Book 6 applies proportions to plane geometry, especially the construction and recognition of similar figures.
* Book 7 deals with elementary number theory: divisibility, prime numbers and their relation to composite numbers, Euclid&#x27;s algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor, finding the least common multiple.
* Book 8 deals with the construction and existence of geometric sequences of integers.
* Book 9 applies the results of the preceding two books and gives the infinitude of prime numbers and the construction of all even perfect numbers.
* Book 10 proves the irrationality of the square roots of non-square integers (e.g. formula_1) and classifies the square roots of incommensurable lines into thirteen disjoint categories. Euclid here introduces the term &quot;irrational&quot;, which has a different meaning than the modern concept of irrational numbers. He also gives a formula to produce Pythagorean triples.
* Book 11 generalizes the results of book 6 to solid figures: perpendicularity, parallelism, volumes and similarity of parallelepipeds.
* Book 12 studies the volumes of cones, pyramids, and cylinders in detail by using the method of exhaustion, a precursor to integration, and shows, for example, that the volume of a cone is a third of the volume of the corresponding cylinder. It concludes by showing that the volume of a sphere is proportional to the cube of its radius (in modern language) by approximating its volume by a union of many pyramids.
* Book 13 constructs the five regular Platonic solids inscribed in a sphere and compares the ratios of their edges to the radius of the sphere.

==Euclid&#x27;s method and style of presentation==

Euclid&#x27;s axiomatic approach and constructive methods were widely influential.

Many of Euclid&#x27;s propositions were constructive, demonstrating the existence of some figure by detailing the steps he used to construct the object using a compass and straightedge. His constructive approach appears even in his geometry&#x27;s postulates, as the first and third postulates stating the existence of a line and circle are constructive. Instead of stating that lines and circles exist per his prior definitions, he states that it is possible to &#x27;construct&#x27; a line and circle. It also appears that, for him to use a figure in one of his proofs, he needs to construct it in an earlier proposition. For example, he proves the Pythagorean theorem by first inscribing a square on the sides of a right triangle, but only after constructing a square on a given line one proposition earlier.

As was common in ancient mathematical texts, when a proposition needed proof in several different cases, Euclid often proved only one of them (often the most difficult), leaving the others to the reader. Later editors such as Theon often interpolated their own proofs of these cases.

Euclid&#x27;s presentation was limited by the mathematical ideas and notations in common currency in his era, and this causes the treatment to seem awkward to the modern reader in some places. For example, there was no notion of an angle greater than two right angles, the number 1 was sometimes treated separately from other positive integers, and as multiplication was treated geometrically he did not use the product of more than 3 different numbers. The geometrical treatment of number theory may have been because the alternative would have been the extremely awkward Alexandrian system of numerals.

The presentation of each result is given in a stylized form, which, although not invented by Euclid, is recognized as typically classical. It has six different parts: First is the &#x27;enunciation&#x27;, which states the result in general terms (i.e., the statement of the proposition). Then comes the &#x27;setting-out&#x27;, which gives the figure and denotes particular geometrical objects by letters. Next comes the &#x27;definition&#x27; or &#x27;specification&#x27;, which restates the enunciation in terms of the particular figure. Then the &#x27;construction&#x27; or &#x27;machinery&#x27; follows. Here, the original figure is extended to forward the proof. Then, the &#x27;proof&#x27; itself follows. Finally, the &#x27;conclusion&#x27; connects the proof to the enunciation by stating the specific conclusions drawn in the proof, in the general terms of the enunciation.

No indication is given of the method of reasoning that led to the result, although the &quot;Data&quot; does provide instruction about how to approach the types of problems encountered in the first four books of the &quot;Elements&quot;. Some scholars have tried to find fault in Euclid&#x27;s use of figures in his proofs, accusing him of writing proofs that depended on the specific figures drawn rather than the general underlying logic, especially concerning Proposition II of Book I. However, Euclid&#x27;s original proof of this proposition, is general, valid, and does not depend on the figure used as an example to illustrate one given configuration. 

== Influence ==

The &quot;Elements&quot; is still considered a masterpiece in the application of logic to mathematics. In historical context, it has proven enormously influential in many areas of science. Scientists Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, Albert Einstein and Sir Isaac Newton were all influenced by the &quot;Elements&quot;, and applied their knowledge of it to their work. Mathematicians and philosophers, such as Thomas Hobbes, Baruch Spinoza, Alfred North Whitehead, and Bertrand Russell, have attempted to create their own foundational &quot;Elements&quot; for their respective disciplines, by adopting the axiomatized deductive structures that Euclid&#x27;s work introduced.

The austere beauty of Euclidean geometry has been seen by many in western culture as a glimpse of an otherworldly system of perfection and certainty. Abraham Lincoln kept a copy of Euclid in his saddlebag, and studied it late at night by lamplight; he related that he said to himself, &quot;You never can make a lawyer if you do not understand what demonstrate means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father&#x27;s house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight&quot;. Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote in her sonnet &quot;Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare&quot;, &quot;O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day, / When first the shaft into his vision shone / Of light anatomized!&quot;. Albert Einstein recalled a copy of the &quot;Elements&quot; and a magnetic compass as two gifts that had a great influence on him as a boy, referring to the Euclid as the &quot;holy little geometry book&quot;.

The success of the &quot;Elements&quot; is due primarily to its logical presentation of most of the mathematical knowledge available to Euclid. Much of the material is not original to him, although many of the proofs are his. However, Euclid&#x27;s systematic development of his subject, from a small set of axioms to deep results, and the consistency of his approach throughout the &quot;Elements&quot;, encouraged its use as a textbook for about 2,000 years. The &quot;Elements&quot; still influences modern geometry books. Furthermore, its logical, axiomatic approach and rigorous proofs remain the cornerstone of mathematics.

=== In modern mathematics ===
One of the most notable influences of Euclid on modern mathematics is the discussion of the parallel postulate. In Book I, Euclid lists five postulates, the fifth of which stipulates

This postulate plagued mathematicians for centuries due to its apparent complexity compared with the other four postulates. Many attempts were made to prove the fifth postulate based on the other four, but they never succeeded. Eventually in 1829, mathematician Nikolai Lobachevsky published a description of acute geometry (or hyperbolic geometry), a geometry which assumed a different form of the parallel postulate. It is in fact possible to create a valid geometry without the fifth postulate entirely, or with different versions of the fifth postulate (elliptic geometry). If one takes the fifth postulate as a given, the result is Euclidean geometry.

== Criticism ==
Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; contains errors. Some of the foundational theorems are proved using axioms that Euclid did not state explicitly. A few proofs have errors, by relying on assumptions that are intuitive but not explicitly proven. Mathematician and historian W. W. Rouse Ball put the criticisms in perspective, remarking that &quot;the fact that for two thousand years [the &quot;Elements&quot;] was the usual text-book on the subject raises a strong presumption that it is not unsuitable for that purpose.&quot;

Later editors have added Euclid&#x27;s implicit axiomatic assumptions in their list of formal axioms. For example, in the first construction of Book 1, Euclid used a premise that was neither postulated nor proved: that two circles with centers at the distance of their radius will intersect in two points. 

Known errors in Euclid date to at least 1882, when Pasch published his missing axiom.

Early attempts to find all the errors include Hilbert&#x27;s geometry axioms and Tarski&#x27;s. In 2017, Michael Beeson et al. used computer proof assistants to create a new set of axioms similar to Euclid&#x27;s and generate proofs that were valid with those axioms. 

Beeson et al. checked only Book I and found these errors: missing axioms, superfluous axioms, gaps in logic (such as failing to prove points were colinear), missing theorems (such as an angle cannot be less than itself), and outright bad proofs. The bad proofs were in Book I, Proof 7 and Book I, Proposition 9.

== Apocrypha ==
It was not uncommon in ancient times to attribute to celebrated authors works that were not written by them. It is by these means that the apocryphal books XIV and XV of the &quot;Elements&quot; were sometimes included in the collection. The spurious Book XIV was probably written by Hypsicles on the basis of a treatise by Apollonius. The book continues Euclid&#x27;s comparison of regular solids inscribed in spheres, with the chief result being that the ratio of the surfaces of the dodecahedron and icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes, the ratio being
formula_2

The spurious Book XV was probably written, at least in part, by Isidore of Miletus. This book covers topics such as counting the number of edges and solid angles in the regular solids, and finding the measure of dihedral angles of faces that meet at an edge.

<text>The Red River Rebellion (), also known as the Red River Resistance, Red River uprising, or First Riel Rebellion, was the sequence of events that led up to the 1869 establishment of a provisional government by Métis leader Louis Riel and his followers at the Red River Colony, in the early stages of establishing today&#x27;s Canadian province of Manitoba. It had earlier been a territory called Rupert&#x27;s Land and been under control of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company before it was sold.

The event was the first crisis the new federal government faced after Canadian Confederation in 1867. The Government of Canada had bought Rupert&#x27;s Land from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1869 and appointed an English-speaking governor, William McDougall. He was opposed by the French-speaking mostly-Métis inhabitants of the settlement. Before the land was officially transferred to Canada, McDougall had sent out surveyors to plot the land according to the square township system used in the Public Land Survey System. The Métis, led by Riel, prevented McDougall from entering the territory. McDougall declared that the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company was no longer in control of the territory and that Canada had asked for the transfer of sovereignty to be postponed. The Métis created a provisional government to which they invited an equal number of Anglophone representatives. Riel negotiated directly with the Canadian government to establish Manitoba as a Canadian province.

Meanwhile, Riel&#x27;s men arrested members of a pro-Canadian faction who had resisted the provisional government. They included an Orangeman, Thomas Scott. Riel&#x27;s government tried and convicted Scott before executing him for insubordination. Canada and the Assiniboia provisional government soon negotiated an agreement. In 1870, the Parliament of Canada passed the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot;, allowing the Red River Colony to enter Confederation as the province of Manitoba. The act also incorporated some of Riel&#x27;s demands, such as the provision of separate French schools for Métis children and the protection of Catholicism.

After reaching an agreement, Canada sent a military expedition to Manitoba to enforce federal authority. Now known as the Wolseley expedition, or the Red River Expedition, it consisted of Canadian militia and British regular soldiers, led by Colonel Garnet Wolseley. Outrage grew in Ontario over Scott&#x27;s execution, and many there wanted Wolseley&#x27;s expedition to arrest Riel for murder and to suppress what they considered to be rebellion.

Riel peacefully withdrew from Fort Garry before the troops could arrive in August 1870. Warned by many that the soldiers would harm him and denied amnesty for his political leadership of the rebellion, Riel fled to the United States. The arrival of troops marked the end of the incident. In 1885 Louis Riel would lead another rebellion, the North-West Rebellion, ending with his capture and execution.

== Background ==
In the late 1860s, the Red River Colony of Rupert&#x27;s Land was changing rapidly. It had developed under the aegis of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC), which had a continent-wide trading and commercial network. It had been confirmed on the territory by Queen Anne, who had evicted King Louis XIV and his subjects from it by the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. Further notice was given in 1763, when King George III dispossessed King Louis XV of nearly all his colonies of North America at the Treaty of Paris.

Historically, the population was mainly francophone Métis, who developed a mixed ethnicity descended of First Nations and French descent and a unique culture during the decades of the fur trade. In the 18th and the 19th centuries, they intermarried; established a tradition of men working as trappers, guides, and interpreters to fur traders; and developed farms. Métis women also were sometimes active in the trade, and among several influential families in Sault Ste. Marie in the early 19th century, the husbands were European. The Métis culture was based on the French language and Roman Catholic religion.

In the late 18th century, English and Scottish men entered the fur trade and also married into the Ojibwe people and other First Nations in this region. Their mixed-race descendants generally spoke English and were sometimes known as the &quot;country born&quot; (also as Anglo-Métis). The third group of settlers to the region was a small number of Presbyterian Scottish settlers. More anglophone Protestants began to settle there from Ontario in the 19th century.

The newer settlers were generally insensitive to Métis culture and hostile to Roman Catholicism, and many advocated Canadian expansionism. Meanwhile, many Americans migrated there, some of whom favouring annexation of the territory by the United States. Against the backdrop of religious, nationalistic, and ethnic tensions, political uncertainty was high. To forestall US expansionism and to bring law and order to the wild, the British and Canadian governments had been for some time negotiating the transfer of Rupert&#x27;s Land from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to Canada. The British Rupert&#x27;s Land Act 1868 authorized the transfer. On December 1, 1869, Canada purchased the territory.

In anticipation of the transfer, Public Works Minister William McDougall, who with George-Étienne Cartier had been instrumental in securing Rupert&#x27;s Land for Canada, ordered a survey party to the Red River Colony. A Catholic bishop, Alexandre-Antonin Taché; the Anglican bishop of Rupert&#x27;s Land, Robert Machray; and the HBC governor of Assiniboia, William Mactavish, all warned the federal government that such surveys would precipitate unrest.

Headed by Colonel John Stoughton Dennis, the survey party arrived at Fort Garry on August 20, 1869. The Métis were anxious about the survey since they did not possess clear title to their lands but held a tenuous right of occupancy. In addition, the lots had been laid out according to the French seigneurial colonial system, with long narrow lots fronting the river, rather than the square lots that were preferred by the English. The Métis considered the survey to be a forerunner of increased Canadian migration to the territory, which they perceived as a threat to their way of life. More specifically, they feared 
a possible confiscation of their farmland by the Canadian government. The Métis were also concerned that Canadian immigrants would not care for their culture and so the Métis wanted to ensure that they could preserve their religious and political rights. Their concerns were motivated in part by the Canadian government&#x27;s behaviour, as the negotiations that took place had carried out as if the territory were uninhabited.

== Emergence of Riel as leader ==

The Canadian government appointed a notorious francophobe, McDougall, as the designate of the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories on September 28, 1869, in anticipation of a formal transfer to take effect on December 1. That increased tensions among the Métis, who, in July 1869, had become more suspicious after McDougall ordered a survey of the settlement. Emerging as a leader, Louis Riel, who had been formally educated in European-style schools, denounced the survey in a speech delivered in late August from the steps of St. Boniface Cathedral. His lifestyle was very different from those of buffalo-hunting Métis. When Riel returned to the West, it was apparent that MacDonald feared that the United States was negotiating with HBC for the transfer of Rupert&#x27;s Land without consulting the Red River population and the Council of Assiniboia. On October 11, 1869, Riel and other Métis disrupted the survey&#x27;s work. On October 16 the group organized the &quot;Métis National Committee&quot; to represent Métis interests. Riel was elected secretary, John Bruce as president, and two representatives were elected from each parish.

There were originally two resistance groups in Red River. One was led by Riel, and the other was led by a Métis named William Dease, who expressed Métis values in his opposition. For a long time they were locked in a power struggle on a symbolic level, both sides offering different perspectives on Métis unity. Riel finally defeated Dease for the leadership of the resistance and consolidated his support system within the French Métis community. He then felt strong enough to initiate the breach of October 1869.

Because the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s Council of Assiniboia still had authority over the area, its representatives summoned Riel on October 25 to explain the actions of the committee. On October 30, McDougall had reached the border despite the written order from Riel, who declared that any attempt by McDougall to enter the Red River Colony would be blocked unless the Canadians had first negotiated terms with the Métis and with the general population of the settlement.

On November 2, under the command of Ambroise-Dydime Lépine, the Métis turned back McDougall&#x27;s party near the US border and forced it to retreat to Pembina, Dakota Territory. On the same day Riel led roughly 400 men recruited from fur-brigades recently returned to the settlement for the season to seize Fort Garry without bloodshed. That would come to be known as one of Riel&#x27;s most brilliant moves, as control of the fort symbolized control of all access to the settlement and the Northwest.

Residents of the Red River Colony disagreed on how to negotiate with Canada. In particular, the French- and English-speaking inhabitants did not agree on how to proceed. In a conciliatory gesture, Riel on November 6 asked the anglophones to select delegates from each of their parishes to attend a convention with the Métis representatives. After little was accomplished at the first meeting, James Ross expressed displeasure at Riel&#x27;s treatment of McDougall. Riel angrily denied that and stated that he had no intentions of invoking American interventions. Instead, throughout the entire resistance, he insisted that he and the Métis were loyal subjects of Queen Victoria.

On November 16, the Council of Assiniboia made a final attempt to assert its authority when Governor Mactavish issued a proclamation ordering the Métis to lay down their arms. Instead, on November 23, Riel proposed the formation of a provisional government to replace the Council of Assiniboia to enter into direct negotiations with Canada. The anglophone delegates requested an adjournment to discuss matters. They neither succeeded in rallying the English-speaking parishes behind that move nor originally approved of the &quot;List of Rights,&quot; which was presented to the convention on December 1. Despite his Métis sympathies, Governor Mactavish did not do enough to end the conflict and was imprisoned by Riel shortly afterward.

Also on December 1, McDougall had proclaimed that the HBC was no longer in control of Rupert&#x27;s Land and that he was the new lieutenant-governor. The proclamation was to later prove problematic, as it effectively ended the authority of the council but failed to establish Canadian authority. McDougall did not know that the transfer had been postponed once news of the unrest had reached Ottawa.

Around mid-December 1869, Riel presented the convention with a list of 14 rights as a condition of union. They included representation in Parliament, a bilingual legislature and chief justice, and recognition of certain land claims. The convention did not adopt the list at the time, but once the list of rights was generally known, most anglophones accepted the majority of the demands as reasonable.

Much of the settlement was moving toward the Métis point of view, but a passionately-pro-Canadian minority became more resistant. It was loosely organized as the Canadian Party and was led by Dr. John Christian Schultz and Charles Mair. Colonel Dennis and Major Charles Boulton also supported it. McDougall appointed Dennis to raise a militia to arrest the Métis, who were occupying Upper Fort Garry. The anglophone settlers largely ignored the call to arms, and Dennis withdrew to Lower Fort Garry. Schultz, however, was emboldened to fortify his house and his store and attracted around 50 recruits.

Riel took the threat seriously and ordered for Schultz&#x27;s home to be surrounded. The resisters surrendered on December 7 and were imprisoned in Fort Garry. The unrest and the absence of a clear authority made the Métis National Committee declare a provisional government on December 8. Having received notification of the delay in the union until the British government of the HBC could guarantee a peaceful transfer, McDougall and Dennis departed for Ontario on December 18. Major Boulton fled to Portage la Prairie.

== Provisional government ==

In Ottawa, Governor General Lord Lisgar had, at the behest of Prime Minister John A. Macdonald, proclaimed an amnesty on December 6 for all in the Red River area who would lay down their arms. He dispatched Abbé Jean-Baptiste Thibault and Charles-René d&#x27;Irumberry de Salaberry on a mission of reconciliation but failed to give them the authority to negotiate on behalf of the government. Macdonald appointed the HBC representative, Donald Alexander Smith, as special commissioner with a greater authority to negotiate.

On December 27, John Bruce resigned as president of the provisional government, and Riel was elected president. The same day, Donald Smith arrived in the settlement, followed shortly by de Salaberry, who joined Thibault, who had arrived on Christmas Day. They met with Riel on January 5, 1870, but reached no conclusions. The next day, Riel and Smith had another meeting. Smith then concluded that negotiation with the committee would be fruitless. He maneuvered to bypass it and to present the Canadian position at a public meeting.

Meetings were held on January 19 and January 20. With Riel acting as translator, Smith assured the large audiences of the Canadian government&#x27;s goodwill, intention to grant representation, and willingness to extend concessions with respect to land claims. With the settlement now solidly behind him, Riel proposed the formation of a new convention of 40 representatives, divided evenly between French- and English-speaking settlers, to consider Smith&#x27;s instructions, which was accepted. A committee of six outlined a more comprehensive list of rights, which the convention accepted on February 3. After meetings on February 7 in which the new list of rights were presented to Thibault, Salaberry, and Smith, Smith proposed for a delegation to be sent to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiations with Canada, a suggestion that was eagerly accepted by Riel.

Riel also proposed for the provisional government to be reformed to be more inclusive of both language groups. A constitution enshrining those goals was accepted by the convention on February 10. An elected assembly was established, consisting of 12 representatives from anglophone parishes and an equal number of representatives from francophone parishes.

== Canadian resistance and execution of Thomas Scott ==
Despite the progress on the political front and the inclusion of anglophones within the provisional government, the Canadian contingent was not yet silenced. On January 9, many prisoners escaped from the prison at Fort Garry, including Charles Mair, Thomas Scott and ten others. John Schultz escaped on January 23. By February 15, Riel had freed the remaining prisoners on &quot;parole&quot; to refrain from engaging in political agitation. Schultz, Mair, and Scott intended to continue to work to depose the Métis from power.

Mair and Scott proceeded to the Canadian settlements surrounding Portage la Prairie, where they met Boulton, and Schultz sought recruits in the Canadian parishes downstream. On February 12, Boulton led a party from Portage la Prairie to rendezvous at Kildonan with Schultz&#x27;s men. They intended to overthrow the provisional government. Boulton had misgivings and turned the party back. Riel&#x27;s forces detected the men, and on February 17, Boulton, Scott, and 46 other men were captured near Fort Garry. On hearing the news, Schultz and Mair fled to Ontario.

Riel demanded for an example to be made of Boulton. He was tried and sentenced to death for his interference with the provisional government. Intercessions on his behalf by Donald Smith and others resulted in his pardon but only after Riel had obtained assurances from Smith that he would persuade the English parishes to elect provisional representatives. However, the prisoner Thomas Scott, an Orangeman, interpreted Boulton&#x27;s pardon as weakness on the part of the Métis, whom he regarded with open contempt. After he had repeatedly quarreled with his guards, they insisted for him to be tried for insubordination. At his trial, which was overseen by Ambroise-Dydime Lépine, he was found guilty of insulting the president, defying the authority of the provisional government, and fighting with his guards. He was sentenced to death although they were not then considered capital crimes. Smith and Boulton asked Riel to commute the sentence, but Smith reported that Riel responded to his pleas by saying, &quot;I have done three good things since I have commenced; I have spared Boulton&#x27;s life at your instance, I pardoned Gaddy, and now I shall shoot Scott.&quot;

Scott was executed by a firing squad on March 4, 1870. Historians have debated Riel&#x27;s motivations for allowing the execution, as they have considered it his one great political blunder. His own justification was that he felt it necessary to demonstrate to the Canadians that the Métis must be taken seriously.

== Creation of Manitoba ==
Upon receiving news of the unrest, Bishop Taché was recalled from Rome. He arrived back in the colony on March 8, and he conveyed to Riel his mistaken impression that the December amnesty would apply to both Riel and Lépine. On March 15, he read to the elected assembly a telegram from Joseph Howe indicating that the government found the demands in the list of rights to be &quot;in the main satisfactory.&quot; After the preparation of a final list of rights, which included new demands such as a general amnesty for all members of the provisional government and provisions for separate francophone schools, the delegates Abbé Joseph-Noël Ritchot, Judge John Black and Alfred Henry Scott departed for Ottawa on March 23 and 24.

Shortly afterward, Mair and Schultz arrived in Toronto, Ontario. Assisted by George Taylor Denison III, they immediately set about inflaming anti-Métis and anti-Catholic sentiment in the editorial pages of the Ontario press over the execution of Scott. However, Macdonald had decided before the provisional government was established, Canada must negotiate with the Métis. Although the delegates were arrested after their arrival in Ottawa on April 11 on charges of abetting murder, they were quickly released. They soon entered into direct talks with Macdonald and George-Étienne Cartier, and Ritchot emerged as an effective negotiator. An agreement enshrining many of the demands in the list of rights was soon reached. That formed the basis for the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; of May 12, 1870, which admitted Manitoba to the Canadian Confederation on July 15.

The government had to deal with several issues before peace could be made. Fortunately for the government, an agreement was reached. With the creation of Manitoba, the Canadian government would gain control over a new area and not have to worry about the Métis being upset, as they would also be gaining control over the land.

On May 12, 1870, the Métis had been given 200,000 hectares of land, which would make up the Province of Manitoba. That would allow for the Métis to hunt freely in their land and have some form of government with legitimate powers to run the province and protect Métis rights. Even though the government had created the Province of Manitoba for the Métis, it also allowed the government to have control over the province without being responsible for any events that occurred in it. Manitoba would be the first province created from the Northwest Territories.

Significantly, however, Ritchot could not secure a clarification of the governor-general&#x27;s amnesty. Anger over Scott&#x27;s execution was growing rapidly in Ontario, and any such guarantee was not politically expedient. The delegates returned to Manitoba with only a promise of a forthcoming amnesty.

== The Wolseley expedition ==

A military expedition had in any case been decided on as a means of exercising Canadian authority in the Red River settlement and dissuading the Minnesota expansionists. It embarked in May under Colonel Garnet Wolseley and made its way up the Great Lakes. Ontarians especially believed the Wolseley Expedition to be intended to suppress the rebellion, but the government described it as an &quot;errand of peace.&quot; Knowing that he would be arrested and charged with criminal acts and believing that members of the Canadian militia in the expedition meant to lynch him, Riel and his followers fled hurriedly when the troops arrived unexpectedly at Fort Garry on August 24 during pouring rain. The arrival of the expedition at Fort Garry marked the effective end of the Red River Rebellion.

== Aftermath ==
The Red River crisis was described as a rebellion only after sentiment grew in Ontario against the execution of Thomas Scott. The historian A. G. Morice suggests that the phrase &quot;Red River Rebellion&quot; owes its persistence to alliteration, a quality that made it attractive for publication in newspaper headlines. The episode has been described as a resistance rather than a rebellion by some scholars as it was resisting against an expanding authority rather than rebelling against an established government.

Lisgar&#x27;s viceregal successor, the Earl of Dufferin, prevented the execution of Ambroise-Dydime Lépine, who had sentenced Scott to death. Although Scott had been the son a tenant on Dufferin&#x27;s estate in Northern Ireland, Dufferin heeded appeals from francophones in Quebec who were sympathetic to the Métis and reduced Lépine&#x27;s sentence to two years in jail.

In 1875, Riel was formally exiled from Canada for five years. Under pressure from Quebec, the government of Sir John A. Macdonald took no more vigorous action. Riel was elected to the Canadian Parliament three times in exile but never took his seat. He returned to Canada in 1885 to lead the ill-fated North-West Rebellion. He was then tried and convicted for high treason and executed by hanging.

== In popular culture==

Canadian folk singer-writer James Keelaghan wrote a song &quot;Red River Rising&quot; about the Red River Rebellion.

Frances Koncan&#x27;s 2020 play &quot;Women of the Fur Trade&quot; was set in a fort in Red River and features three women discussing the events around them.

<doc id="244111" wikidata="Q823464" url="?curid=244111" title="Law of Jante">
<text>The Law of Jante ( ) is a code of conduct originating in fiction and now used colloquially to denote a social attitude of disapproval towards expressions of individuality and personal success. Coined by the Danish-Norwegian author Aksel Sandemose, it has also come to represent the egalitarian nature of Scandinavian countries.

The &quot;Law&quot; was first formulated as ten rules in Sandemose&#x27;s satirical novel &quot;A Fugitive Crosses His Tracks&quot; (, 1933), but the attitudes themselves are older. Sandemose portrays the fictional small Danish town of Jante, modelled upon his native town Nykøbing Mors in the 1930s where nobody was anonymous, a feature of life typical of small towns. 

==Definition==
There are ten rules in the law as defined by Sandemose, all expressive of variations on a single theme and usually referred to as a homogeneous unit: &quot;You are not to think you&#x27;re anyone special, or that you&#x27;re better than us.&quot; 

The ten rules state:
# You&#x27;re not to think &quot;you&quot; are anything special.
# You&#x27;re not to think &quot;you&quot; are as good as &quot;we&quot; are.
# You&#x27;re not to think &quot;you&quot; are smarter than &quot;we&quot; are.
# You&#x27;re not to imagine yourself better than &quot;we&quot; are.
# You&#x27;re not to think &quot;you&quot; know more than &quot;we&quot; do.
# You&#x27;re not to think &quot;you&quot; are more important than &quot;we&quot; are.
# You&#x27;re not to think &quot;you&quot; are good at anything.
# You&#x27;re not to laugh at &quot;us&quot;.
# You&#x27;re not to think anyone cares about &quot;you&quot;.
# You&#x27;re not to think &quot;you&quot; can teach &quot;us&quot; anything.

The Janters who transgress this unwritten &quot;law&quot; are regarded with suspicion and some hostility, as it goes against the town&#x27;s communal desire to preserve harmony, social stability and uniformity.

An eleventh rule recognized in the novel as &quot;the penal code of Jante&quot; is:

From the chapter &quot;Maybe you don&#x27;t think I know something about you&quot;:
That one sentence (the eleventh rule), which acts as the penal code of Jante, as such was rich in content. It was an accusation of absolutely anything, and that it also had to be, because absolutely nothing was allowed. It was also an elaborate indictment, with all kinds of unspecified penalties given to be expected. Furthermore it was useful, depending fully on tone of voice, in financial extortion and enticement into criminal acts, and it could also be the best means of defense.

Sandemose&#x27;s novel described working-class life in the fictional town of Jante. He wrote in 1955, a bit mischievously, that &quot;Many people have recognized [in Jante] their own hometown – this has happened regularly to people from Arendal [Norway], Tromsø [Norway] and Viborg [Denmark]&quot;. Sandemose made no claim to having invented the rules; he simply sought to formulate social norms that had stamped the Danish and Norwegian psyches for centuries.

==Sociological effects==
Although intended as criticism of society in general, some critics in the 1990s argued that the Law of Jante had shifted to refer to personal criticism of people who want to break out of their social groups and reach a higher position.

It is common in Scandinavia to claim the Law of Jante as something quintessentially Danish, Norwegian or Swedish. The rules are treated as a way of behaving in order to fit in and results in dressing similarly and the types of cars that people buy and buying similar products for their homes. It is commonly stated that Jante Law is for people in the provinces, but commentators have suggested that metropolitan areas are also affected.

While the original intention was as satire, Kim Orlin Kantardjiev, a Norwegian politician and educational advisor, claims that the Law of Jante is taught in schools as more of a social code to encourage group behavior, and attempts to credit it with fueling Nordic countries&#x27; high happiness scores. It has also been suggested that contentedness with a humdrum lifestyle is a part of happiness in the Scandinavian countries.

However, in Scandinavia, there have also been journalistic articles which link the Law of Jante to high suicide rates. Backlash has occurred against the rules, and in Norway someone even placed a grave for Jante Laws, declaring them dead in 2005. However, others have questioned whether they will ever go away, as they may be firmly entrenched in society.

== Appearance in English-language sources ==

* When interviewed during episode 646 of &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, broadcast November 9, 2018, Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård explained that although he had recently received an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for a lauded performance, the inhibitions induced by the Law of Jante prevented him from boasting of the accolade.
* In &quot;Wisting&quot;, a 2019 Norwegian police procedural television series, partially in English, the character Line says (translated), &quot;The newspaper sales numbers and the Law of Jante are merging.&quot;
*In &quot;Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown&quot;, Bourdain and René Redzepi discuss &quot;Janteloven&quot;″s effect on Danish culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN_10/6/2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*In some interviews, Greta Thunberg credits and appreciates the &quot;law&quot; for her being ignored by Swedes that see her in public.
* This &quot;law&quot; is prominent in Swedish culture and the Swedish parliament sees it as potentially harmful, holding people back.

<text>Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is a tick-borne disease caused by species of &quot;Borrelia&quot; bacteria, transmitted by blood-feeding ticks in the genus &quot;Ixodes&quot;. The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash, known as erythema migrans (EM), which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterwards. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 70–80% of infected people develop a rash. Early diagnosis can be difficult. Other early symptoms may include fever, headaches and tiredness. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness or heart palpitations. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop.
Lyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks of the genus &quot;Ixodes&quot;. In the United States, ticks of concern are usually of the &quot;Ixodes scapularis&quot; type. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &quot;In most cases, a tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours or more before the Lyme disease bacterium can be transmitted. If you remove a tick quickly (within 24 hours), you can greatly reduce your chances of getting Lyme disease.&quot; In Europe, &quot;Ixodes ricinus&quot; ticks may spread the bacteria more quickly. In North America, the bacterial species &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi &quot;and &quot;B. mayonii&quot; cause Lyme disease. In Europe and Asia,&quot; Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia garinii, B. spielmanii&quot; and four other species also cause the disease. The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals nor through food. Diagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. Blood tests are often falsely negative in the early stages of the disease. Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful.
Prevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites by wearing clothing to cover the arms and legs and using DEET or picaridin-based insect repellents. Using pesticides to reduce tick numbers may also be effective. Ticks can be removed using tweezers. If the removed tick is full of blood a single dose of doxycycline may be used to prevent the development of infection but is not generally recommended since the development of infection is rare. If an infection develops, a number of antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime. Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. Some people develop a fever and muscle and joint pains from treatment, which may last for one or two days. In those who develop persistent symptoms, long-term antibiotic therapy has not been found to be useful.
Lyme disease is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. Infections are most common in the spring and early summer. Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut. It was originally mistaken for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The bacterium involved was first described in 1981 by Willy Burgdorfer. People with persistent symptoms after appropriate treatments are said to have Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS). PTLDS is different from chronic Lyme disease, a term no longer supported by scientists and used in different ways by different groups. Some healthcare providers claim that chronic Lyme is caused by persistent infection, but this is not believed to be true because no evidence of persistent infection can be found after standard treatment.

, clinical trials of proposed human vaccines for Lyme disease were being carried out, but no vaccine was available. A vaccine, LYMERix, was produced, but discontinued in 2002 due to insufficient demand. There are several vaccines for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.

==Signs and symptoms==

Lyme disease can produce a broad range of symptoms.

The incubation period is usually one to two weeks, but can be much shorter (days) or much longer (months to years). Lyme symptoms most often occur from the month of May to September in the Northern Hemisphere because the nymphal stage of the tick is responsible for most cases.

===Early localized infection===
80% of Lyme infections begin with a rash of some sort at the site of a tick bite, often near skin folds such as the armpit, groin, back of the knee, or the trunk under clothing straps, or in children&#x27;s hair, ears, or neck. Most people who get infected do not remember seeing a tick or a bite. The rash appears typically one or two weeks (range 3–32 days) after the bite and expands 2–3 cm per day up to a diameter of 5–70 cm (median is 16 cm).

The rash is usually circular or oval, red or bluish, and may have an elevated or darker center. This rash is termed an erythema migrans (EM) which translates as &quot;migrating redness.&quot; In about 79% of cases in Europe, this rash gradually clears from the center toward the edges possibly forming a &quot;bull&#x27;s eye&quot; or &quot;target-like&quot; pattern, but this clearing only happens in 19% of cases in endemic areas of the United States. The rash may feel warm, usually is not itchy, is rarely tender or painful, and takes up to four weeks to resolve if untreated.

The Lyme rash is often accompanied by symptoms of a flu-like illness, including fatigue, headache, body aches, fever, and chills [though usually neither nausea nor upper-respiratory problems]. These symptoms may also appear without a rash or linger after the rash has disappeared. Lyme can progress to later stages without a rash or these symptoms.

People with high fever for more than two days or whose other symptoms of viral-like illness do not improve despite antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, or who have abnormally low levels of white or red cells or platelets in the blood, should be investigated for possible coinfection with other tick-borne diseases such as ehrlichiosis and babesiosis.

Not everyone with Lyme disease has all the symptoms, and many of these symptoms can also occur with other diseases.

Asymptomatic infection exists, but occurs in less than 7% of infected individuals in the United States. Asymptomatic infection may be much more common among those infected in Europe.

===Early disseminated infection===
Within days to weeks after the onset of local infection, the &quot;Borrelia&quot; bacteria may spread through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. In 10–20% of untreated cases, EM rashes develop at sites across the body that bear no relation to the original tick bite. Transient muscle pains and joint pains are also common.

In about 10–15% of untreated people, Lyme causes neurological problems known as neuroborreliosis. Early neuroborreliosis typically appears 4–6 weeks (range 1–12 weeks) after the tick bite and involves some combination of lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculopathy, and/or mononeuritis multiplex. Lymphocytic meningitis causes characteristic changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may be accompanied for several weeks by variable headache and, less commonly, usually mild meningitis signs such as inability to flex the neck fully and intolerance to bright lights but typically no or only very low fever. After several months neuroborreliosis can also present otolaryngological symptoms. Up to 76.5% of them present as tinnitus, the most common symptom. Vertigo and dizziness (53.7%) and hearing loss (16.7%) were the next most common symptoms. In children, partial loss of vision may also occur. Cranial neuritis is an inflammation of cranial nerves. When due to Lyme, it most typically causes facial palsy, impairing blinking, smiling, and chewing on one or both sides of the face. It may also cause intermittent double vision. Lyme radiculopathy is an inflammation of spinal nerve roots that often causes pain and less often weakness, numbness, or altered sensation in the areas of the body served by nerves connected to the affected roots, e.g. limb(s) or part(s) of trunk. The pain is often described as unlike any other previously felt, excruciating, migrating, worse at night, rarely symmetrical, and often accompanied by extreme sleep disturbance. Mononeuritis multiplex is an inflammation causing similar symptoms in one or more unrelated peripheral nerves. Rarely, early neuroborreliosis may involve inflammation of the brain or spinal cord, with symptoms such as confusion, abnormal gait, ocular movements, or speech, impaired movement, impaired motor planning, or shaking.

In North America, facial palsy is the typical early neuroborreliosis presentation, occurring in 5–10% of untreated people, in about 75% of cases accompanied by lymphocytic meningitis. Lyme radiculopathy is reported half as frequently, but many cases may be unrecognized. In European adults, the most common presentation is a combination of lymphocytic meningitis and radiculopathy known as Bannwarth syndrome, accompanied in 36-89% of cases by facial palsy. In this syndrome, radicular pain tends to start in the same body region as the initial erythema migrans rash, if there was one, and precedes possible facial palsy and other impaired movement. In extreme cases, permanent impairment of motor or sensory function of the lower limbs may occur. In European children, the most common manifestations are facial palsy (in 55%), other cranial neuritis, and lymphocytic meningitis (in 27%).

In about 4–10% of untreated cases in the United States and 0.3–4% of untreated cases in Europe, typically between June and December, about one month (range 4 days to 7 months) after the tick bite, the infection may cause heart complications known as Lyme carditis. Symptoms may include heart palpitations (in 69% of people), dizziness, fainting, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Other symptoms of Lyme disease may also be present, such as EM rash, joint aches, facial palsy, headaches, or radicular pain. In some people, however, carditis may be the first manifestation of Lyme disease. Lyme carditis in 19–87% of people adversely impacts the heart&#x27;s electrical conduction system, causing atrioventricular block that often manifests as heart rhythms that alternate within minutes between abnormally slow and abnormally fast. In 10–15% of people, Lyme causes myocardial complications such as cardiomegaly, left ventricular dysfunction, or congestive heart failure.

Another skin condition, found in Europe but not in North America, is borrelial lymphocytoma, a purplish lump that develops on the ear lobe, nipple, or scrotum.

=== Late disseminated infection===

Lyme arthritis occurs in up to 60% of untreated people, typically starting about six months after infection. It usually affects only one or a few joints, often a knee or possibly the hip, other large joints, or the temporomandibular joint. Usually, large joint effusion and swelling occur, but only mild or moderate pain. Without treatment, swelling and pain typically resolve over time, but periodically return. Baker&#x27;s cysts may form and rupture.

In early US studies of Lyme disease, a rare peripheral neuropathy was described that included numbness, tingling, or burning starting at the feet or hands and over time possibly moving up the limbs. In a later analysis that discovered poor documentation of this manifestation, experts wondered if it exists at all in the US or is merely very rare.

A neurologic syndrome called Lyme encephalopathy is associated with subtle memory and cognitive difficulties, insomnia, a general sense of feeling unwell, and changes in personality. Lyme encephalopathy is controversial in the US and has not been reported in Europe. Problems such as depression and fibromyalgia are as common in people with Lyme disease as in the general population. There is no compelling evidence that Lyme disease causes psychiatric disorders, behavioral disorders (e.g. ADHD), or developmental disorders (e.g. autism).

Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is a chronic skin disorder observed primarily in Europe among the elderly. It begins as a reddish-blue patch of discolored skin, often on the backs of the hands or feet. The lesion slowly atrophies over several weeks or months, with the skin becoming first thin and wrinkled and then, if untreated, completely dry and hairless. It is also associated with peripheral neuropathy.

==Cause==

Lyme disease is caused by spirochetes, gram-negative bacteria from the genus &quot;Borrelia&quot;. Spirochetes are surrounded by peptidoglycan and flagella. The Lyme-related &quot;Borrelia&quot; species are collectively known as &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato&quot;, and show a great deal of genetic diversity.

&quot;B. burgdorferi sensu lato&quot; is a species complex made up of 20 accepted and three proposed genospecies. Eight species are known to cause Lyme disease: &quot;B. mayonii&quot; (found in North America), &quot;B. burgdorferi sensu stricto&quot; (found in North America and Europe), &quot;B. afzelii&quot;, &quot;B. garinii, B. spielmanii,&quot; and &quot;B. lusitaniae&quot; (all found in Eurasia). Some studies have also proposed that &quot;B. valaisiana&quot; may sometimes infect humans, but this species does not seem to be an important cause of disease.

=== Tick life cycle ===
Three stages occur in the life cycle of a tick - larva, nymph, and adult. During the nymph stage, ticks most frequently transmit Lyme disease and are usually most active in late spring and early summer in regions where the climate is mild. During the adult stage, Lyme disease transmission is less common because adult ticks are less likely to bite humans and tend to be larger in size, so can be easily seen and removed.

===Transmission===
Lyme disease is classified as a zoonosis, as it is transmitted to humans from a natural reservoir among small mammals and birds by ticks that feed on both sets of hosts. Hard-bodied ticks of the genus &quot;Ixodes&quot; are the vectors of Lyme disease (also the vector for &quot;Babesia&quot;). Most infections are caused by ticks in the nymphal stage, because they are very small, thus may feed for long periods of time undetected. Nymphal ticks are generally the size of a poppy seed and sometimes with a dark head and a translucent body. Or, the nymphal ticks can be darker. The younger larval ticks are very rarely infected. Although deer are the preferred hosts of adult deer ticks, and tick populations are much lower in the absence of deer, ticks generally do not acquire &quot;Borrelia&quot; from deer, instead they obtain them from infected small mammals such as the white-footed mouse, and occasionally birds. Areas where Lyme is common are expanding.

Within the tick midgut, the &quot;Borrelia&quot;″s outer surface protein A (OspA) binds to the tick receptor for OspA, known as TROSPA. When the tick feeds, the&quot; Borrelia&quot; downregulates OspA and upregulates OspC, another surface protein. After the bacteria migrate from the midgut to the salivary glands, OspC binds to Salp15, a tick salivary protein that appears to have immunosuppressive effects that enhance infection. Successful infection of the mammalian host depends on bacterial expression of OspC.

Tick bites often go unnoticed because of the small size of the tick in its nymphal stage, as well as tick secretions that prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the bite. However, transmission is quite rare, with only about 1.2 to 1.4 percent of recognized tick bites resulting in Lyme disease.

While &quot;B. burgdorferi&quot; is most associated with ticks hosted by white-tailed deer and white-footed mice, &quot;Borrelia afzelii&quot; is most frequently detected in rodent-feeding vector ticks, and &quot;Borrelia garinii&quot; and &quot;Borrelia valaisiana&quot; appear to be associated with birds. Both rodents and birds are competent reservoir hosts for &quot;B. burgdorferi sensu stricto&quot;. The resistance of a genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes to the bacteriolytic activities of the alternative complement pathway of various host species may determine its reservoir host association.

Budding research has suggested that &quot;B. burgdorferi sensu lato&quot; may also be able to form enzootic cycle among lizard populations; this was previously assumed not to be possible in major areas containing populations of lizards, such as California. Except for one study in Europe, much of the data implicating lizards is based on DNA detection of the spirochete and has not demonstrated that lizards are able to infect ticks feeding upon them. As some experiments suggest lizards are refractory to infection with &quot;Borrelia&quot;, it appears likely their involvement in the enzootic cycle is more complex and species-specific.
In Europe, the main vector is &quot;Ixodes ricinus&quot;, which is also called the sheep tick or castor bean tick. In China, &quot;Ixodes persulcatus&quot; (the taiga tick) is probably the most important vector. In North America, the black-legged tick or deer tick (&quot;Ixodes scapularis&quot;) is the main vector on the East Coast.

The lone star tick (&quot;Amblyomma americanum&quot;), which is found throughout the Southeastern United States as far west as Texas, is unlikely to transmit the Lyme disease spirochetes, though it may be implicated in a related syndrome called southern tick-associated rash illness, which resembles a mild form of Lyme disease.

On the West Coast of the United States, the main vector is the western black-legged tick (&quot;Ixodes pacificus&quot;). The tendency of this tick species to feed predominantly on host species such as the western fence lizard that are resistant to &quot;Borrelia&quot; infection appears to diminish transmission of Lyme disease in the West.

Transmission can occur across the placenta during pregnancy and as with a number of other spirochetal diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes are possible with untreated infection; prompt treatment with antibiotics reduces or eliminates this risk.

There is no scientific evidence to support Lyme disease transmission via blood transfusion, sexual contact, or breast milk.

===Tick-borne co-infections===

Ticks that transmit &quot;B. burgdorferi&quot; to humans can also carry and transmit several other microbes, such as &quot;Babesia microti&quot; and &quot;Anaplasma phagocytophilum&quot;, which cause the diseases babesiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), respectively. Among people with early Lyme disease, depending on their location, 2–12% will also have HGA and 2–10% will have babesiosis. Ticks in certain regions also transmit viruses that cause tick-borne encephalitis and Powassan virus disease. Co-infections of Lyme disease may not require additional treatment, since they may resolve on their own or—as in the case of HGA—can be treated with the doxycycline prescribed for Lyme. Persistent fever or compatible anomalous laboratory findings may be indicative of a co-infection.

==Pathophysiology==
&quot;B. burgdorferi&quot; can spread throughout the body during the course of the disease, and has been found in the skin, heart, joints, peripheral nervous system, and central nervous system. &quot;B. Burgdorferi&quot; does not produce toxins. Therefore, many of the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are a consequence of the immune response to spirochete in those tissues.

&quot;B. burgdorferi&quot; is injected into the skin by the bite of an infected &quot;Ixodes&quot; tick. Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite. This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the dermis. The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion. Neutrophils, however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in necessary numbers in the developing EM lesion because tick saliva inhibits neutrophil function. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body.

Days to weeks following the tick bite, the spirochetes spread via the bloodstream to joints, heart, nervous system, and distant skin sites, where their presence gives rise to the variety of symptoms of the disseminated disease. The spread of &quot;B. burgdorferi&quot; is aided by the attachment of the host protease plasmin to the surface of the spirochete.

If untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of &quot;B. burgdorferi&quot; antibodies by the immune system. The spirochetes may avoid the immune response by decreasing expression of surface proteins that are targeted by antibodies, antigenic variation of the VlsE surface protein, inactivating key immune components such as complement, and hiding in the extracellular matrix, which may interfere with the function of immune factors.

===Immunological studies===
Exposure to the &quot;Borrelia&quot; bacterium during Lyme disease possibly causes a long-lived and damaging inflammatory response, a form of pathogen-induced autoimmune disease. The production of this reaction might be due to a form of molecular mimicry, where &quot;Borrelia&quot; avoids being killed by the immune system by resembling normal parts of the body&#x27;s tissues.

Chronic symptoms from an autoimmune reaction could explain why some symptoms persist even after the spirochetes have been eliminated from the body. This hypothesis may explain why chronic arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy, similar to rheumatic fever, but its wider application is controversial.

==Diagnosis==
Lyme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as erythema migrans (EM) rash, facial palsy, or arthritis), history of possible exposure to infected ticks, and possibly laboratory tests. People with symptoms of early Lyme disease should have a total body skin examination for EM rashes and asked whether EM-type rashes had manifested within the last 1–2 months. Presence of an EM rash and recent tick exposure (i.e., being outdoors in a likely tick habitat where Lyme is common, within 30 days of the appearance of the rash) are sufficient for Lyme diagnosis; no laboratory confirmation is needed or recommended. Most people who get infected do not remember a tick or a bite, and the EM rash need not look like a bull&#x27;s eye (most EM rashes in the U.S. do not) or be accompanied by any other symptoms. In the U.S., Lyme is most common in the New England and Mid-Atlantic states and parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota, but it is expanding into other areas. Several bordering areas of Canada also have high Lyme risk.

In the absence of an EM rash or history of tick exposure, Lyme diagnosis depends on laboratory confirmation. The bacteria that cause Lyme disease are difficult to observe directly in body tissues and also difficult and too time-consuming to grow in the laboratory. The most widely used tests look instead for presence of antibodies against those bacteria in the blood. A positive antibody test result does not by itself prove active infection but can confirm an infection that is suspected because of symptoms, objective findings, and history of tick exposure in a person. Because as many as 5–20% of the normal population have antibodies against Lyme, people without history and symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease should not be tested for Lyme antibodies: a positive result would likely be false, possibly causing unnecessary treatment.

In some cases, when history, signs, and symptoms are strongly suggestive of early disseminated Lyme disease, empiric treatment may be started and reevaluated as laboratory test results become available.

===Laboratory testing===
Tests for antibodies in the blood by ELISA and Western blot is the most widely used method for Lyme diagnosis. A two-tiered protocol is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): the sensitive ELISA test is performed first, and if it is positive or equivocal, then the more specific Western blot is run. The immune system takes some time to produce antibodies in quantity. After Lyme infection onset, antibodies of types IgM and IgG usually can first be detected respectively at 2–4 weeks and 4–6 weeks, and peak at 6–8 weeks. When an EM rash first appears, detectable antibodies may not be present. Therefore, it is recommended that testing not be performed and diagnosis be based on the presence of the EM rash. Up to 30 days after suspected Lyme infection onset, infection can be confirmed by detection of IgM or IgG antibodies; after that, it is recommended that only IgG antibodies be considered. A positive IgM and negative IgG test result after the first month of infection is generally indicative of a false-positive result. The number of IgM antibodies usually collapses 4–6 months after infection, while IgG antibodies can remain detectable for years.

Other tests may be used in neuroborreliosis cases. In Europe, neuroborreliosis is usually caused by Borrelia garinii and almost always involves lymphocytic pleocytosis, i.e. the densities of lymphocytes (infection-fighting cells) and protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically rise to characteristically abnormal levels, while glucose level remains normal. Additionally, the immune system produces antibodies against Lyme inside the intrathecal space, which contains the CSF. Demonstration by lumbar puncture and CSF analysis of pleocytosis and intrathecal antibody production are required for definite diagnosis of neuroborreliosis in Europe (except in cases of peripheral neuropathy associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, which usually is caused by Borrelia afzelii and confirmed by blood antibody tests). In North America, neuroborreliosis is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and may not be accompanied by the same CSF signs; they confirm a diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) neuroborreliosis if positive, but do not exclude it if negative. American guidelines consider CSF analysis optional when symptoms appear to be confined to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), e.g. facial palsy without overt meningitis symptoms. Unlike blood and intrathecal antibody tests, CSF pleocytosis tests revert to normal after infection ends and therefore can be used as objective markers of treatment success and inform decisions on whether to retreat. In infection involving the PNS, electromyography and nerve conduction studies can be used to monitor objectively the response to treatment.

In Lyme carditis, electrocardiograms are used to evidence heart conduction abnormalities, while echocardiography may show myocardial dysfunction. Biopsy and confirmation of Borrelia cells in myocardial tissue may be used in specific cases but are usually not done because of risk of the procedure.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for Lyme disease have also been developed to detect the genetic material (DNA) of the Lyme disease spirochete. Culture or PCR are the current means for detecting the presence of the organism, as serologic studies only test for antibodies of &quot;Borrelia&quot;. PCR has the advantage of being much faster than culture. However, PCR tests are susceptible to false positive results, e.g. by detection of debris of dead Borrelia cells or specimen contamination. Even when properly performed, PCR often shows false-negative results because few Borrelia cells can be found in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during infection. Hence, PCR tests are recommended only in special cases, e.g. diagnosis of Lyme arthritis, because it is a highly sensitive way of detecting &quot;ospA&quot; DNA in synovial fluid. Although sensitivity of PCR in CSF is low, its use may be considered when intrathecal antibody production test results are suspected of being falsely negative, e.g. in very early (&lt; 6 weeks) neuroborreliosis or in immunosuppressed people.

Several other forms of laboratory testing for Lyme disease are available, some of which have not been adequately validated. OspA antigens, shed by live &quot;Borrelia&quot; bacteria into urine, are a promising technique being studied. The use of nanotrap particles for their detection is being looked at and the OspA has been linked to active symptoms of Lyme. High titers of either immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to &quot;Borrelia&quot; antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can be misleading, because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years.

The CDC does not recommend urine antigen tests, PCR tests on urine, immunofluorescent staining for cell-wall-deficient forms of &quot;B. burgdorferi&quot;, and lymphocyte transformation tests.

===Imaging===
Neuroimaging is controversial in whether it provides specific patterns unique to neuroborreliosis, but may aid in differential diagnosis and in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. Though controversial, some evidence shows certain neuroimaging tests can provide data that are helpful in the diagnosis of a person. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are two of the tests that can identify abnormalities in the brain of a person affected with this disease. Neuroimaging findings in an MRI include lesions in the periventricular white matter, as well as enlarged ventricles and cortical atrophy. The findings are considered somewhat unexceptional because the lesions have been found to be reversible following antibiotic treatment. Images produced using SPECT show numerous areas where an insufficient amount of blood is being delivered to the cortex and subcortical white matter. However, SPECT images are known to be nonspecific because they show a heterogeneous pattern in the imaging. The abnormalities seen in the SPECT images are very similar to those seen in people with cerebral vasculitis and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, which makes them questionable.

===Differential diagnosis===
Community clinics have been reported to misdiagnose 23–28% of erythema migrans (EM) rashes and 83% of other objective manifestations of early Lyme disease. EM rashes are often misdiagnosed as spider bites, cellulitis, or shingles. Many misdiagnoses are credited to the widespread misconception that EM rashes should look like a bull&#x27;s eye. Actually, the key distinguishing features of the EM rash are the speed and extent to which it expands, respectively up to 2–3 cm/day and a diameter of at least 5 cm, and in 50% of cases more than 16 cm. The rash expands away from its center, which may or may not look different or be separated by ring-like clearing from the rest of the rash. Compared to EM rashes, spider bites are more common in the limbs, tend to be more painful and itchy or become swollen, and some may cause necrosis (sinking dark blue patch of dead skin). Cellulitis most commonly develops around a wound or ulcer, is rarely circular, and is more likely to become swollen and tender. EM rashes often appear at sites that are unusual for cellulitis, such as the armpit, groin, abdomen, or back of knee. Like Lyme, shingles often begins with headache, fever, and fatigue, which are followed by pain or numbness. However, unlike Lyme, in shingles these symptoms are usually followed by appearance of rashes composed of multiple small blisters along with a nerve&#x27;s dermatome, and shingles can also be confirmed by quick laboratory tests.

Facial palsy caused by Lyme disease (LDFP) is often misdiagnosed as Bell&#x27;s palsy. Although Bell&#x27;s palsy is the most common type of one-sided facial palsy (about 70% of cases), LDFP can account for about 25% of cases of facial palsy in areas where Lyme disease is common. Compared to LDFP, Bell&#x27;s palsy much less frequently affects both sides of the face. Even though LDFP and Bell&#x27;s palsy have similar symptoms and evolve similarly if untreated, corticosteroid treatment is beneficial for Bell&#x27;s Palsy, while being detrimental for LDFP. Recent history of exposure to a likely tick habitat during warmer months, EM rash, viral-like symptoms such as headache and fever, and/or palsy in both sides of the face should be evaluated for the likelihood of LDFP; if it is more than minimal, empiric therapy with antibiotics should be initiated, without corticosteroids, and reevaluated upon completion of laboratory tests for Lyme disease.

Unlike viral meningitis, Lyme lymphocytic meningitis tends to not cause fever, last longer, and recur. Lymphocytic meningitis is also characterized by possibly co-occurring with EM rash, facial palsy, or partial vision obstruction and having much lower percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in CSF.

Lyme radiculopathy affecting the limbs is often misdiagnosed as a radiculopathy caused by nerve root compression, such as sciatica. Although most cases of radiculopathy are compressive and resolve with conservative treatment (e.g., rest) within 4–6 weeks, guidelines for managing radiculopathy recommend first evaluating risks of other possible causes that, although less frequent, require immediate diagnosis and treatment, including infections such as Lyme and shingles. A history of outdoor activities in likely tick habitats in the last 3 months possibly followed by a rash or viral-like symptoms, and current headache, other symptoms of lymphocytic meningitis, or facial palsy would lead to suspicion of Lyme disease and recommendation of serological and lumbar puncture tests for confirmation.

Lyme radiculopathy affecting the trunk can be misdiagnosed as myriad other conditions, such as diverticulitis and acute coronary syndrome. Diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease is often complicated by a multifaceted appearance and nonspecific symptoms, prompting one reviewer to call Lyme the new &quot;great imitator&quot;. As all people with later-stage infection will have a positive antibody test, simple blood tests can exclude Lyme disease as a possible cause of a person&#x27;s symptoms.

==Prevention==
Tick bites may be prevented by avoiding or reducing time in likely tick habitats and taking precautions while in and when getting out of one.

Most Lyme human infections are caused by Ixodes nymph bites between April and September. Ticks prefer moist, shaded locations in woodlands, shrubs, tall grasses and leaf litter or wood piles. Tick densities tend to be highest in woodlands, followed by unmaintained edges between woods and lawns (about half as high), ornamental plants and perennial groundcover (about a quarter), and lawns (about 30 times less). Ixodes larvae and nymphs tend to be abundant also where mice nest, such as stone walls and wood logs. Ixodes larvae and nymphs typically wait for potential hosts (&quot;quest&quot;) on leaves or grasses close to the ground with forelegs outstretched; when a host brushes against its limbs, the tick rapidly clings and climbs on the host looking for a skin location to bite. In Northeastern United States, 69% of tick bites are estimated to happen in residences, 11% in schools or camps, 9% in parks or recreational areas, 4% at work, 3% while hunting, and 4% in other areas. Activities associated with tick bites around residences include yard work, brush clearing, gardening, playing in the yard, and letting dogs or cats that roam outside in woody or grassy areas into the house. In parks, tick bites often happen while hiking or camping. Walking on a mown lawn or center of a trail without touching adjacent vegetation is less risky than crawling or sitting on a log or stone wall. Pets should not be allowed to roam freely in likely tick habitats.

As a precaution, CDC recommends soaking or spraying clothes, shoes, and camping gear such as tents, backpacks and sleeping bags with 0.5% permethrin solution and hanging them to dry before use. Permethrin is odorless and safe for humans but highly toxic to ticks. After crawling on permethrin-treated fabric for as few as 10–20 seconds, tick nymphs become irritated and fall off or die. Permethrin-treated closed-toed shoes and socks reduce by 74 times the number of bites from nymphs that make first contact with a shoe of a person also wearing treated shorts (because nymphs usually quest near the ground, this is a typical contact scenario). Better protection can be achieved by tucking permethrin-treated trousers (pants) into treated socks and a treated long-sleeve shirt into the trousers so as to minimize gaps through which a tick might reach the wearer&#x27;s skin. Light-colored clothing may make it easier to see ticks and remove them before they bite. Military and outdoor workers&#x27; uniforms treated with permethrin have been found to reduce the number of bite cases by 80–95%. Permethrin protection lasts several weeks of wear and washings in customer-treated items and up to 70 washings for factory-treated items. Permethrin should not be used on human skin, underwear or cats.

The EPA recommends several tick repellents for use on exposed skin, including DEET, picaridin, IR3535 (a derivative of amino acid beta-alanine), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, a natural compound) and OLE&#x27;s active ingredient para-menthane-diol (PMD). Unlike permethrin, repellents repel but do not kill ticks, protect for only several hours after application, and may be washed off by sweat or water. The most popular repellent is DEET in the U.S. and picaridin in Europe. Unlike DEET, picaridin is odorless and is less likely to irritate the skin or harm fabric or plastics. Repellents with higher concentration may last longer but are not more effective; against ticks, 20% picaridin may work for 8 hours vs. 55–98.11% DEET for 5–6 hours or 30–40% OLE for 6 hours. Repellents should not be used under clothes, on eyes, mouth, wounds or cuts, or on babies younger than 2 months (3 years for OLE or PMD). If sunscreen is used, repellent should be applied on top of it. Repellents should not be sprayed directly on a face, but should instead be sprayed on a hand and then rubbed on the face.

After coming indoors, clothes, gear and pets should be checked for ticks. Clothes can be put into a hot dryer for 10 minutes to kill ticks (just washing or warm dryer are not enough). Showering as soon as possible, looking for ticks over the entire body, and removing them reduce risk of infection. Unfed tick nymphs are the size of a poppy seed, but a day or two after biting and attaching themselves to a person, they look like a small blood blister. The following areas should be checked especially carefully: armpits, between legs, back of knee, bellybutton, trunk, and in children ears, neck and hair.

===Tick removal===

Attached ticks should be removed promptly. Risk of infection increases with time of attachment, but in North America risk of Lyme disease is small if the tick is removed within 36 hours. CDC recommends inserting a fine-tipped tweezer between the skin and the tick, grasping very firmly, and pulling the closed tweezer straight away from the skin without twisting, jerking, squeezing or crushing the tick. After tick removal, any tick parts remaining in the skin should be removed with a clean tweezer, if possible. The wound and hands should then be cleaned with alcohol or soap and water. The tick may be disposed by placing it in a container with alcohol, sealed bag, tape or flushed down the toilet. The bitten person should write down where and when the bite happened so that this can be informed to a doctor if the person gets a rash or flu-like symptoms in the following several weeks. CDC recommends not using fingers, nail polish, petroleum jelly or heat on the tick to try to remove it.

In Australia, where the Australian paralysis tick is prevalent, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy recommends not using tweezers to remove ticks, because if the person is allergic, anaphylaxis could result. Instead, a product should be sprayed on the tick to cause it to freeze and then drop off. Another method consists in using about 20 cm of dental floss or fishing line for slowly tying an overhand knot between the skin and the tick and then pulling it away from the skin.

===Preventive antibiotics===

The risk of infectious transmission increases with the duration of tick attachment. It requires between 36 and 48 hours of attachment for the bacteria that causes Lyme to travel from within the tick into its saliva. If a deer tick that is sufficiently likely to be carrying &quot;Borrelia&quot; is found attached to a person and removed, and if the tick has been attached for 36 hours or is engorged, a single dose of doxycycline administered within the 72 hours after removal may reduce the risk of Lyme disease. It is not generally recommended for all people bitten, as development of infection is rare: about 50 bitten people would have to be treated this way to prevent one case of erythema migrans (i.e. the typical rash found in about 70–80% of people infected).

===Garden landscaping===
Several landscaping practices may reduce the risk of tick bites in residential yards. These include keeping lawns mown, removing leaf litter and weeds and avoiding the use of ground cover. A 3-ft-wide rock or woodchip barrier is recommended to separate lawns from wood piles, woodlands, stone walls and shrubs. Without vegetation on the barrier, ticks will tend not to cross it; acaricides may also be sprayed on it to kill ticks. A sun-exposed tick-safe zone at least 9 ft from the barrier should concentrate human activity on the yard, including any patios, playgrounds and gardening. Materials such as wood decking, concrete, bricks, gravel or woodchips used on the ground under patios and playgrounds would discourage ticks there. An 8-ft-high fence may be added to keep deer away from the tick-safe zone.

===Occupational exposure===
Outdoor workers are at risk of Lyme disease if they work at sites with infected ticks. This includes construction, landscaping, forestry, brush clearing, land surveying, farming, railroad work, oil field work, utility line work, park or wildlife management. U.S. workers in the northeastern and north-central states are at highest risk of exposure to infected ticks. Ticks may also transmit other tick-borne diseases to workers in these and other regions of the country. Worksites with woods, bushes, high grass or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Outdoor workers should be most careful to protect themselves in the late spring and summer when young ticks are most active.

===Host animals===
Ticks can feed upon the blood of a wide array of possible host species, including lizards, birds, mice, cats, dogs, deer, cattle and humans. The extent to which a tick can feed, reproduce, and spread will depend on the type and availability of its hosts. Whether it will spread disease is also affected by its available hosts. Some species, such as lizards, are referred to as &quot;dilution hosts&quot; because they don&#x27;t tend to support Lyme disease pathogens and so decrease the likelihood that the disease will be passed on by ticks feeding on them. White-tailed deer are both a food source and a &quot;reproductive host&quot;, where ticks tend to mate. The white-footed mouse is a reservoir host in which the pathogen for Lyme disease can survive. Availability of hosts can have significant impacts on the transmission of Lyme disease. A greater diversity of hosts, or of those that don&#x27;t support the pathogen, tends to decrease the likelihood that the disease will be transmitted.

In the United States, one approach to reducing the incidence of Lyme and other deer tick-borne diseases has been to greatly reduce the deer population on which the adult ticks depend for feeding and reproduction. Lyme disease cases fell following deer eradication on an island, Monhegan, Maine, and following deer control in Mumford Cove, Connecticut. Advocates have suggested reducing the deer population to levels of 8 to 10 deer per square mile, compared to levels of 60 or more deer per square mile in the areas of the country with the highest Lyme disease rates. While these studies have found these effects, other studies have found opposite effects. A study done in Massachusetts removed deer and did not see a significant decrease in tick abundance afterwards. Another study done in New Jersey removed deer and also did not see a reduction in the number of questing ticks and determined that deer culling is an unlikely way to effectively control tick populations. One study summarized the results of multiple studies all looking at deer reduction controlling tick populations and determined that deer control can&#x27;t be used as a standalone reduction for Lyme disease. It also claims that since most of the studies looking at this are not good representatives of areas with high human Lyme disease risk. There is varying information on whether or not the removal of deer is actually a way to control the Lyme disease epidemic. Removal of smaller mammals that are fed on by juveniles who are more actively acquiring and spreading the pathogen, would decrease Lyme disease risk the most.

Others have noted that while deer are reproductive hosts, they are not &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot; reservoirs. This is because it was found that white-tailed deer blood actually kills the &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot; bacteria. Researchers have suggested that smaller, less obviously visible Lyme reservoirs, like white-footed mice and Eastern chipmunks, may more strongly impact Lyme disease occurrence. Ecosystem studies in New York state suggest that white-footed mice thrive when forests are broken into smaller isolated chunks of woodland with fewer rodent predators. With more rodents harboring the disease, the odds increase that a tick will feed on a disease-harboring rodent and that someone will pick up a disease-carrying tick in their garden or walking in the woods. Data indicates that the smaller the wooded area, the more ticks it will contain and the likely they are to carry Lyme disease, supporting the idea that deforestation and habitat fragmentation affect ticks, hosts and disease transmission.

Tick-borne diseases are estimated to affect ~80 % of cattle worldwide. They also affect cats, dogs, and other pets. Routine veterinary control of ticks of domestic animals through the use of acaricides has been suggested as a way to reduce exposure of humans to ticks. However, chemical control with acaricides is now criticized on a number of grounds. Ticks appear to develop resistance to acaricides; acaricides are costly; and there are concerns over their toxicity and the potential for chemical residues to affect food and the environment.

In Europe, known reservoirs of &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot; were 9 small mammals, 7 medium-sized mammals and 16 species of birds (including passerines, sea-birds and pheasants). These animals seem to transmit spirochetes to ticks and thus participate in the natural circulation of B. burgdorferi in Europe. The house mouse is also suspected as well as other species of small rodents, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia. &quot;The reservoir species that contain the most pathogens are the European roe deer &quot;Capreolus capreolus&quot;; &quot;it does not appear to serve as a major reservoir of B. burgdorferi&quot; thought Jaenson &amp; al. (1992) (incompetent host for &quot;B. burgdorferi&quot; and TBE virus) but it is important for feeding the ticks, as red deer and wild boars (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;), in which one &quot;Rickettsia&quot; and three &quot;Borrelia&quot; species were identified&quot;, with high risks of coinfection in roe deer. Nevertheless, in the 2000s, in roe deer in Europe &quot;two species of Rickettsia and two species of Borrelia were identified&quot;.

==Vaccination==
 no human vaccines for Lyme disease were available. The only human vaccine to advance to market was LYMErix, which was available from 1998, but discontinued in 2002. The vaccine candidate VLA15 was scheduled to start a phase 3 trial in the third quarter of 2022, with other research ongoing. Multiple vaccines are available for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.

===LYMErix===
The vaccine LYMErix was available from 1998 to 2002. The recombinant vaccine against Lyme disease, based on the outer surface protein A (OspA) of &quot;B. burgdorferi&quot; with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant, was developed by SmithKline Beecham. In clinical trials involving more than 10,000 people, the vaccine was found to confer protective immunity to Lyme disease in 76% of adults after three doses with only mild or moderate and transient adverse effects. On 21 December 1998, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LYMErix on the basis of these trials for persons of ages 15 through 70.

Following approval of the vaccine, its entry into clinical practice was slow for a variety of reasons, including its cost, which was often not reimbursed by insurance companies. Subsequently, hundreds of vaccine recipients reported they had developed autoimmune and other side effects. Supported by some advocacy groups, a number of class-action lawsuits were filed against GlaxoSmithKline, alleging the vaccine had caused these health problems. These claims were investigated by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control, which found no connection between the vaccine and the autoimmune complaints.

Despite the lack of evidence that the complaints were caused by the vaccine, sales plummeted and LYMErix was withdrawn from the U.S. market by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2002, in the setting of negative media coverage and fears of vaccine side effects. The fate of LYMErix was described in the medical literature as a &quot;cautionary tale&quot;; an editorial in &quot;Nature&quot; cited the withdrawal of LYMErix as an instance in which &quot;unfounded public fears place pressures on vaccine developers that go beyond reasonable safety considerations.&quot; The original developer of the OspA vaccine at the Max Planck Institute told &quot;Nature&quot;: &quot;This just shows how irrational the world can be ... There was no scientific justification for the first OspA vaccine LYMErix being pulled.&quot;

===VLA15===
The hexavalent (OspA) protein subunit-based vaccine candidate VLA15 was developed by Valneva. It was granted fast track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2017. In April 2020 Pfizer paid $130 million for the rights to the vaccine, and the companies are developing it together, performing multiple phase 2 trials.

A phase 3 trial of VLA15 was scheduled for late 2022, recruiting volunteers at test sites located across the northeastern United States and in Europe. Participants were scheduled to receive an initial three-dose series of vaccines over the course of five to nine months, followed by a booster dose after twelve months, with both the initial series and the booster dose scheduled to be complete before the year&#x27;s peak Lyme disease season.

===Other research===
An mRNA vaccine designed to cause a strong fast immune response to tick saliva allowed the immune system to detect and remove the ticks from test animals before they were able to transmit the infectious bacteria. The vaccine contains mRNAs for the body to build 19 proteins in tick saliva which, by enabling quick development of erythema (itchy redness) at the bite site, protects guinea pigs against Lyme disease. It also protected the test animals if the tick is not removed if only one tick, but not three, remain attached.

===Canine vaccines===
Canine vaccines have been formulated and approved for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs. Currently, three Lyme disease vaccines are available. LymeVax, formulated by Fort Dodge Laboratories, contains intact dead spirochetes which expose the host to the organism. Galaxy Lyme, Intervet-Schering-Plough&#x27;s vaccine, targets proteins OspC and OspA. The OspC antibodies kill any of the bacteria that have not been killed by the OspA antibodies. Canine Recombinant Lyme, formulated by Merial, generates antibodies against the OspA protein so a tick feeding on a vaccinated dog draws in blood full of anti-OspA antibodies, which kill the spirochetes in the tick&#x27;s gut before they are transmitted to the dog.

==Treatment==

Antibiotics are the primary treatment. The specific approach to their use is dependent on the individual affected and the stage of the disease. For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of doxycycline is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only &quot;Borrelia&quot; bacteria but also a variety of other illnesses carried by ticks. People taking doxycycline should avoid sun exposure because of higher risk of sunburns. Doxycycline is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; alternatives to doxycycline are amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and azithromycin. Azithromycin is recommended only in case of intolerance to the other antibiotics. The standard treatment for cellulitis, cephalexin, is not useful for Lyme disease. When it is unclear if a rash is caused by Lyme or cellulitis, the IDSA recommends treatment with cefuroxime or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, as these are effective against both infections. Individuals with early disseminated or late Lyme infection may have symptomatic cardiac disease, Lyme arthritis, or neurologic symptoms like facial palsy, radiculopathy, meningitis, or peripheral neuropathy. Intravenous administration of ceftriaxone is recommended as the first choice in these cases; cefotaxime and doxycycline are available as alternatives.
Treatment regimens for Lyme disease range from 7–14 days in early localized disease, to 14–21 days in early disseminated disease to 14–28 days in late disseminated disease. Neurologic complications of Lyme disease may be treated with doxycycline as it can be taken by mouth and has a lower cost, although in North America evidence of efficacy is only indirect. In case of failure, guidelines recommend retreatment with injectable ceftriaxone. Several months after treatment for Lyme arthritis, if joint swelling persists or returns, a second round of antibiotics may be considered; intravenous antibiotics are preferred for retreatment in case of poor response to oral antibiotics. Outside of that, a prolonged antibiotic regimen lasting more than 28 days is not recommended as no evidence shows it to be effective. IgM and IgG antibody levels may be elevated for years even after successful treatment with antibiotics. As antibody levels are not indicative of treatment success, testing for them is not recommended.

Facial palsy may resolve without treatment: however, antibiotic treatment is recommended to stop other Lyme complications. Corticosteroids are not recommended when facial palsy is caused by Lyme disease. In those with facial palsy, frequent use of artificial tears while awake is recommended, along with ointment and a patch or taping the eye closed when sleeping.

About a third of people with Lyme carditis need a temporary pacemaker until their heart conduction abnormality resolves, and 21% need to be hospitalized. Lyme carditis should not be treated with corticosteroids.

People with Lyme arthritis should limit their level of physical activity to avoid damaging affected joints, and in case of limping should use crutches. Pain associated with Lyme disease may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Corticosteroid joint injections are not recommended for Lyme arthritis that is being treated with antibiotics. People with Lyme arthritis treated with intravenous antibiotics or two months of oral antibiotics who continue to have joint swelling two months after treatment and have negative PCR test for &quot;Borrelia&quot; DNA in the synovial fluid are said to have post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis; this is more common after infection by certain Borrelia strains in people with certain genetic and immunologic characteristics. Post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis may be symptomatically treated with NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), arthroscopic synovectomy, or physical therapy.

People receiving treatment should be advised that reinfection is possible and how to prevent it.

==Prognosis==
Lyme disease&#x27;s typical first sign, the erythema migrans (EM) rash, resolves within several weeks even without treatment. However, in untreated people, the infection often disseminates to the nervous system, heart or joints, possibly causing permanent damage to body tissues.

People who receive recommended antibiotic treatment within several days of appearance of an initial EM rash have the best prospects. Recovery may not be total or immediate. The percentage of people achieving full recovery in the United States increases from about 64–71% at end of treatment for EM rash to about 84–90% after 30 months; higher percentages are reported in Europe. Treatment failure, i.e. persistence of original or appearance of new signs of the disease, occurs only in a few people. Remaining people are considered cured but continue to experience subjective symptoms, e.g. joint or muscle pains or fatigue. These symptoms are usually mild and nondisabling.

People treated only after nervous system manifestations of the disease may end up with objective neurological deficits, in addition to subjective symptoms. In Europe, an average of 32–33 months after initial Lyme symptoms in people treated mostly with doxycycline 200 mg for 14–21 days, the percentage of people with lingering symptoms was much higher among those diagnosed with neuroborreliosis (50%) than among those with only an EM rash (16%). In another European study, 5 years after treatment for neuroborreliosis lingering symptoms were less common among children (15%) than adults (30%), and in the latter were less common among those treated within 30 days of the first symptom (16%) than among those treated later (39%); among those with lingering symptoms, 54% had daily activities restricted and 19% were on sick leave or incapacitated.

Some data suggest that about 90% of Lyme facial palsies treated with antibiotics recover fully a median of 24 days after appearing and most of the rest recover with only mild abnormality. However, in Europe 41% of people treated for facial palsy had other lingering symptoms at followup up to 6 months later, including 28% with numbness or altered sensation and 14% with fatigue or concentration problems. Palsies in both sides of the face are associated with worse and longer time to recovery. Historical data suggests that untreated people with facial palsies recover at nearly the same rate, but 88% subsequently have Lyme arthritis. Other research shows that synkinesis (involuntary movement of a facial muscle when another one is voluntarily moved) can become evident only 6–12 months after facial palsy appears to be resolved, as damaged nerves regrow and sometimes connect to incorrect muscles. Synkinesis is associated with corticosteroid use. In longer-term follow-up, 16–23% of Lyme facial palsies do not fully recover.

In Europe, about a quarter of people with Bannwarth syndrome (Lyme radiculopathy and lymphocytic meningitis) treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 14 days an average of 30 days after first symptoms had to be retreated 3–6 months later because of unsatisfactory clinical response or continued objective markers of infection in cerebrospinal fluid; after 12 months, 64% recovered fully, 31% had nondisabling mild or infrequent symptoms that did not require regular use of analgesics, and 5% had symptoms that were disabling or required substantial use of analgesics. The most common lingering nondisabling symptoms were headache, fatigue, altered sensation, joint pains, memory disturbances, malaise, radicular pain, sleep disturbances, muscle pains, and concentration disturbances. Lingering disabling symptoms included facial palsy and other impaired movement.

Recovery from late neuroborreliosis tends to take longer and be less complete than from early neuroborreliosis, probably because of irreversible neurologic damage.

About half the people with Lyme carditis progress to complete heart block, but it usually resolves in a week. Other Lyme heart conduction abnormalities resolve typically within 6 weeks. About 94% of people have full recovery, but 5% need a permanent pacemaker and 1% end up with persistent heart block (the actual percentage may be higher because of unrecognized cases). Lyme myocardial complications usually are mild and self-limiting. However, in some cases Lyme carditis can be fatal.

Recommended antibiotic treatments are effective in about 90% of Lyme arthritis cases, although it can take several months for inflammation to resolve and a second round of antibiotics is often necessary. Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis also eventually resolves, typically within 9–14 months (range 4 months – 4 years); DMARDs or synovectomy can accelerate recovery.

Reinfection is not uncommon. In a U.S. study, 6–11% of people treated for an EM rash had another EM rash within 30 months. The second rash typically is due to infection by a different Borrelia strain.

=== Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome ===
Chronic symptoms like pain, fatigue, or cognitive impairment are experienced by 5–20% of people who contract Lyme disease, even after completing treatment. This is called Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS.

The cause is unknown. One hypothesis is that a persistent, difficult-to-detect infection remains. However, human and animal trials have not provided compelling evidence to support this hypothesis. Another hypothesis is that autoimmunity has been triggered by the infection. Auto–immune responses are known to occur following other infections, including &quot;Campylobacter&quot; (Guillain-Barré syndrome), &quot;Chlamydia&quot; (reactive arthritis), and strep throat (rheumatic heart disease). A third hypothesis is that debris from 
a previous infection could remain.

Another hypothesis is that symptoms are simply unrelated to a Lyme infection. In studies of people who presented to clinics with concerns about Lyme disease, 47 to 80% had no evidence of Lyme infection while 15 to 55% (median 34%) were able to obtain other diagnoses.

There is no proven treatment for Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. While short-term antibiotics are effective in early Lyme disease, prolonged antibiotics are not. They have been shown ineffective in placebo-controlled trials and carry the risk of serious, sometimes deadly complications. Generally, treatment is symptomatic and is similar to the management of fibromyalgia or ME/CFS. PTLDS usually gets better over time, but recovery may take many months.

==Epidemiology and prevalence==
===Overview===
Lyme disease occurs regularly in Northern Hemisphere temperate regions. 

Lyme disease effects are comparable among males and females. A wide range of age groups is affected, though the number of cases is highest among 10- to 19-year-olds.

An estimated 476,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated for the disease in the United States. This number is probably an overestimate due to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Over 200,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated in Europe. 

There is a suggestion that tick populations and Lyme disease occurrence are increasing and spreading into new areas, owing in part to the warming temperatures of climate change. However, tick-borne disease systems are complex, and determining whether changes are due to climate change or other drivers can be difficult. 

===North America===
Many studies in North America have examined ecological and environmental correlates of the number of people affected by Lyme disease. A 2005 study using climate suitability modelling of &quot;I. scapularis&quot; projected that climate change would cause an overall 213% increase in suitable vector habitat by 2080, with northward expansions in Canada, increased suitability in the central U.S., and decreased suitable habitat and vector retraction in the southern U.S. A 2008 review of published studies concluded that the presence of forests or forested areas was the only variable that consistently elevated the risk of Lyme disease whereas other environmental variables showed little or no concordance between studies. The authors argued that the factors influencing tick density and human risk between sites are still poorly understood, and that future studies should be conducted over longer time periods, become more standardized across regions, and incorporate existing knowledge of regional Lyme disease ecology.

=====United States=====
Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America and Europe, and one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the United States. Of cases reported to the United States CDC, the ratio of Lyme disease infection is 7.9 cases for every 100,000 persons. In the ten states where Lyme disease is most common, the average was 31.6 cases for every 100,000 persons for the year 2005.

Although Lyme disease has been reported in all states due to travel-associated infections, about 99% of all reported cases are confined to just five geographic areas (New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central). CDC implemented national surveillance of Lyme disease cases in 1991. Since then, reporting criteria has been modified multiple times. The 2022 surveillance case definition classifies cases as confirmed, probable, and suspect. The number of reported cases of the disease has been increasing, as are endemic regions in North America.

The CDC emphasizes that, while surveillance data has limitations, it is useful due to &quot;uniformity, simplicity, and timeliness.&quot; While cases are under-reported in high-incidence areas, over-reporting is likely in low-incidence areas. Additionally, surveillance cases are reported by county of residence and not where an infection was necessarily contracted.

Several similar but apparently distinct conditions may exist, caused by various species or subspecies of &quot;Borrelia&quot; in North America. A regionally restricted condition that may be related to &quot;Borrelia&quot; infection is southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), also known as Masters disease. &quot;Amblyomma americanum&quot;, known commonly as the lone-star tick, is recognized as the primary vector for STARI. In some parts of the geographical distribution of STARI, Lyme disease is quite rare (e.g., Arkansas), so people in these regions experiencing Lyme-like symptoms—especially if they follow a bite from a lone-star tick—should consider STARI as a possibility. It is generally a milder condition than Lyme and typically responds well to antibiotic treatment.

In recent years there have been 5 to 10 cases a year of a disease similar to Lyme occurring in Montana. It occurs primarily in pockets along the Yellowstone River in central Montana. People have developed a red bull&#x27;s-eye rash around a tick bite followed by weeks of fatigue and a fever.

=====Canada=====
The range of ticks able to carry Lyme disease has expanded from a limited area of Ontario to include areas of southern Quebec, Manitoba, northern Ontario, southern New Brunswick, southwest Nova Scotia and limited parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as British Columbia. Cases have been reported as far east as the island of Newfoundland. A model-based prediction by Leighton &quot;et al.&quot; (2012) suggests that the range of the &quot;I. scapularis&quot; tick will expand into Canada by 46 km/year over the next decade, with warming climatic temperatures as the main driver of increased speed of spread.

===Europe===
In Europe, Lyme disease is caused by infection with one or more pathogenic European genospecies of the spirochaete &quot;B. burgdorferi sensu lato&quot;, mainly transmitted by the tick &quot;Ixodes ricinus&quot;. Cases of &quot;B. burgdorferi sensu lato&quot;-infected ticks are found predominantly in central Europe, particularly in Slovenia and Austria, but have been isolated in almost every country on the continent. The number of cases in southern Europe, such as Italy and Portugal, is much lower. Diagnosed cases in some Western countries, such as Iceland, are rising. Lyme disease is rare in Iceland. On average around 6 to 7 cases are diagnosed every year, primarily localised infections presenting as erythema migrans. None of the cases had a definitive Icelandic origin and the yearly number of cases has not been increasing.

=====United Kingdom=====
In the United Kingdom the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease has been rising steadily since voluntary reporting was introduced in 1986 when 68 cases were recorded in the UK and Ireland combined. In the UK there were 23 confirmed cases in 1988 and 19 in 1990, but 973 in 2009 and 953 in 2010. Provisional figures for the first 3 quarters of 2011 show a 26% increase on the same period in 2010.

It is thought, however, that the actual number of cases is significantly higher than suggested by the above figures, with England&#x27;s Health Protection Agency estimating that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 cases in England and Wales per year (with an average of around 15% of the infections acquired overseas), while Dr Darrel Ho-Yen, Director of the Scottish Toxoplasma Reference Laboratory and National Lyme Disease Testing Service, believes that the number of confirmed cases should be multiplied by 10 &quot;to take account of wrongly diagnosed cases, tests giving false results, sufferers who weren&#x27;t tested, people who are infected but not showing symptoms, failures to notify and infected individuals who don&#x27;t consult a doctor.&quot;

Despite Lyme disease (&quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot; infection) being a notifiable disease in Scotland since January 1990 which should therefore be reported on the basis of clinical suspicion, it is believed that many GPs are unaware of the requirement. Mandatory reporting, limited to laboratory test results only, was introduced throughout the UK in October 2010, under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010.

Although there is a greater number of cases of Lyme disease in the New Forest, Salisbury Plain, Exmoor, the South Downs, parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire, Thetford Forest and the West coast and islands of Scotland, infected ticks are widespread and can even be found in the parks of London. A 1989 report found that 25% of forestry workers in the New Forest were seropositive, as were between 2% and 4–5% of the general local population of the area.

Tests on pet dogs carried out throughout the country in 2009 indicated that around 2.5% of ticks in the UK may be infected, considerably higher than previously thought. It is speculated that global warming may lead to an increase in tick activity in the future, as well as an increase in the amount of time that people spend in public parks, thus increasing the risk of infection. However no published research has proven this to be so.

===South America===
In Brazil, Lyme disease is not considered endemic. A Lyme-like disease known as Baggio–Yoshinari syndrome has been described, attributed to microorganisms that do not belong to the &quot;B. burgdorferi sensu lato&quot; complex and transmitted by ticks of the &quot;Amblyomma&quot; and &quot;Rhipicephalus&quot; genera. The first reported case of BYS in Brazil was made in 1992 in Cotia, São Paulo. A 2024 analysis concluded that evidence to connect BYS to &quot;Borrelia&quot; bacteria was lacking.

====Mexico====
A 2007 study suggests &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot; infections are endemic to Mexico, from four cases reported between 1999 and 2000.

===Africa===
In northern Africa, &quot;B. burgdorferi sensu lato&quot; has been identified in Morocco, Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia.

Lyme disease in sub-Saharan Africa is presently unknown, but evidence indicates it may occur in humans in this region. The abundance of hosts and tick vectors would favor the establishment of Lyme infection in Africa. In East Africa, two cases of Lyme disease have been reported in Kenya. According The Federation of Infectious Diseases Societies of Southern Africa, Lyme disease is not known to be endemic in either South Africa or Mozambique.

===Asia===
&quot;B. burgdorferi sensu lato&quot;-infested ticks are being found more frequently in Japan, as well as in northwest China, Nepal, Thailand and far eastern Russia. &quot;Borrelia&quot; has also been isolated in Mongolia.

===Australiasia===
Lyme disease is not considered endemic to Australia. While there have been reports of people acquiring Lyme disease in Australia, and even evidence of closely related &quot;Borrelia&quot; species in ticks, the evidence linking these cases to local transmission is limited. Ongoing research on resolving potential &quot;Borrelia&quot; species to Debilitating Symptom Complexes Attributed to Ticks (DSCATT) in Australia are ongoing.

== Etymology ==
Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut.

==History==

===Early evidence===
The earliest known evidence of Lyme disease was found in Oetzi, a 5300 year old mummy in the Eastern Alps near the Italian border.
The evolutionary history of &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot; genetics has been examined by scientists. One study has found that prior to the reforestation that accompanied post-colonial farm abandonment in New England and the wholesale migration into the mid-west that occurred during the early 19th century, Lyme disease had been present for thousands of years in America and had spread along with its tick hosts from the Northeast to the Midwest.

John Josselyn, who visited New England in 1638 and again from 1663 to 1670, wrote &quot;there be infinite numbers of ticks hanging upon the bushes in summertime that will cleave to man&#x27;s garments and creep into his breeches, eating themselves in a short time into the very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockings of those that have gone through the woods covered with them.&quot;

This is also confirmed by the writings of Peter Kalm, a Swedish botanist who was sent to America by Linnaeus, and who found the forests of New York &quot;abound&quot; with ticks when he visited in 1749. When Kalm&#x27;s journey was retraced 100 years later, the forests were gone and the Lyme bacterium had probably become isolated to a few pockets along the northeast coast, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.

Perhaps the first detailed description of what is now known as Lyme disease appeared in the writings of John Walker after a visit to the island of Jura (Deer Island) off the west coast of Scotland in 1764. He gives a good description both of the symptoms of Lyme disease (with &quot;exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs&quot;) and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a &quot;worm&quot; with a body which is &quot;of a reddish color and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side&quot; that &quot;penetrates the skin&quot;. Many people from this area of Great Britain emigrated to North America between 1717 and the end of the 18th century.

The examination of preserved museum specimens has found &quot;Borrelia&quot; DNA in an infected &quot;Ixodes ricinus&quot; tick from Germany that dates back to 1884, and from an infected mouse from Cape Cod that died in 1894. The 2010 autopsy of Ötzi the Iceman, a 5,300-year-old mummy, revealed the presence of the DNA sequence of &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot; making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease.

The early European studies of what is now known as Lyme disease described its skin manifestations. The first study dates to 1883 in Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland), where physician Alfred Buchwald described a man who for 16 years had had a degenerative skin disorder now known as acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans.

At a 1909 research conference, Swedish dermatologist Arvid Afzelius presented a study about an expanding, ring-like lesion he had observed in an older woman following the bite of a sheep tick. He named the lesion &quot;erythema migrans&quot;. The skin condition now known as borrelial lymphocytoma was first described in 1911.

===Modern history===
The modern history of medical understanding of the disease, including its cause, diagnosis, and treatment, has been difficult.

Neurological problems following tick bites were recognized starting in the 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory radiculitis accompanied by mild meningitis following a tick bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström was the first to propose EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related. In the 1940s, German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.

Carl Lennhoff, who worked at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, believed many skin conditions were caused by spirochetes. In 1948, he published on his use of a special stain to microscopically observe what he believed were spirochetes in various types of skin lesions, including EM. Although his conclusions were later shown to be erroneous, interest in the study of spirochetes was sparked. Starting in 1946, facilities in Sweden experimented with treating EM rashes with substances known to kill spirochetes. reported that &quot;penicillin was found to be the most effective.&quot; In 1949, Nils Thyresson, who also worked at the Karolinska Institute, was the first to treat ACA with penicillin. In the 1950s, the relationship among tick bite, lymphocytoma, EM and Bannwarth&#x27;s syndrome was recognized throughout Europe leading to the widespread use of penicillin for treatment in Europe.

In 1970 a dermatologist in Wisconsin named Rudolph Scrimenti recognized an EM lesion in a person after recalling a paper by Hellerström that had been reprinted in an American science journal in 1950. This was the first documented case of EM in the United States. Based on the European literature, he treated the person with penicillin.

The full syndrome now known as Lyme disease was not recognized until a cluster of cases originally thought to be juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was identified in three towns in southeastern Connecticut in 1975, including the towns Lyme and Old Lyme, which gave the disease its popular name. This was investigated by physicians David Snydman and Allen Steere of the Epidemic Intelligence Service, and by others from Yale University, including Stephen Malawista, who is credited as a co-discover of the disease. The recognition that the people in the United States had EM led to the recognition that &quot;Lyme arthritis&quot; was one manifestation of the same tick-borne condition known in Europe.

Before 1976, the elements of &quot;B. burgdorferi sensu lato&quot; infection were called or known as tick-borne meningopolyneuritis, Garin-Bujadoux syndrome, Bannwarth syndrome, Afzelius&#x27;s disease, Montauk Knee or sheep tick fever. Since 1976 the disease is most often referred to as Lyme disease, Lyme borreliosis or simply borreliosis.

In 1980, Steere, &quot;et al.&quot;, began to test antibiotic regimens in adults with Lyme disease. In the same year, New York State Health Dept. epidemiologist Jorge Benach provided Willy Burgdorfer, a researcher at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, with collections of &quot;I. dammini&quot; [&quot;scapularis&quot;] from Shelter Island, New York, a known Lyme-endemic area as part of an ongoing investigation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In examining the ticks for rickettsiae, Burgdorfer noticed &quot;poorly stained, rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes.&quot; Further examination revealed spirochetes in 60% of the ticks. Burgdorfer credited his familiarity with the European literature for his realization that the spirochetes might be the &quot;long-sought cause of ECM and Lyme disease.&quot; Benach supplied him with more ticks from Shelter Island and sera from people diagnosed with Lyme disease. University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour &quot;offered his expertise to culture and immunochemically characterize the organism.&quot; Burgdorfer subsequently confirmed his discovery by isolating, from people with Lyme disease, spirochetes identical to those found in ticks. In June 1982, he published his findings in Science, and the spirochete was named &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot; in his honor.

After the identification of &quot;B. burgdorferi&quot; as the causative agent of Lyme disease, antibiotics were selected for testing, guided by &quot;in vitro&quot; antibiotic sensitivities, including tetracycline antibiotics, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, intravenous and intramuscular penicillin and intravenous ceftriaxone. The mechanism of tick transmission was also the subject of much discussion. &quot;B. burgdorferi&quot; spirochetes were identified in tick saliva in 1987, confirming the hypothesis that transmission occurred via tick salivary glands.

==Society, culture, and controversy==
===Landscape changes and urbanization===

Urbanization and other anthropogenic factors can be implicated in the spread of Lyme disease to humans. In many areas, expansion of suburban neighborhoods has led to gradual deforestation of surrounding wooded areas and increased border contact between humans and tick-dense areas. Human expansion has also resulted in a reduction of predators that hunt deer as well as mice, chipmunks and other small rodents—the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. As a consequence of increased human contact with host and vector, the likelihood of transmission of the disease has greatly increased. Researchers are investigating possible links between global warming and the spread of vector-borne diseases, including Lyme disease.

===The dilution effect===

Given these habitat-host dynamics, in 2003 some researchers began to postulate whether the so called dilution effect could mitigate the spread of Lyme disease. The dilution effect is a hypothesis that predicts that an increase in host biodiversity will result in a decrease in the number of vectors infected with &quot;B. burgdorferi&quot;. Scientific research has shown that nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) decreases as the number of host species increases, supporting the dilution effect. That said, there is no direct relationship between decreased NIP and decreased epidemiological risk, as this has yet to be proven. Additionally, as of 2018, the dilution effect is only supported in the Northeastern United States, and has been disproved in other parts of the world that also experience high Lyme disease incidence rates 

===Chronic Lyme disease===
The term &quot;chronic Lyme disease&quot; is controversial and not recognized in the medical literature, and most medical authorities advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. Studies have shown that most people diagnosed with &quot;chronic Lyme disease&quot; either have no objective evidence of previous or current infection with &quot;B. burgdorferi&quot; or are people who should be classified as having post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), which is defined as continuing or relapsing non-specific symptoms (such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints) in a person previously treated for Lyme disease.

The 2008 documentary &quot;Under Our Skin&quot; is known for promoting controversial and unrecognized theories about &quot;chronic Lyme disease&quot;.

===Conspiracy theories about origins ===

Prolific but unfounded conspiracy theories have alleged that Lyme disease was a biological weapon that originated in the Plum Island laboratory, which is near Old Lyme, CT. A discredited 2004 book entitled &quot;Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government&#x27;s Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory&quot; fueled the conspiracy theories. Archived specimens show that Lyme disease was endemic well before the establishment of Plum Island laboratory. Additionally, Lyme disease was never a topic of research at Plum Island, according to the US Department of Homeland Security and Department of Agriculture.

In 2024 and 2025, conspiracy theories about the origins of Lyme disease were further spread due to attention from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

===Lyme disease awareness===
As of 2024 awareness of Lyme disease in mainstream media continued to grow. Well-known personalities who discussed their Lyme disease experiences included Avril Lavigne, Alec Baldwin and Miranda Hart.

==Other animals==
=== Dogs ===
Prevention of Lyme disease is an important step in keeping dogs safe in endemic areas. Prevention education and a number of preventive measures are available. First, for dog owners who live near or who often frequent tick-infested areas, routine vaccinations of their dogs is an important step.

Another crucial preventive measure is the use of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes (Amitraz), phenylpyrazoles (Fipronil), or permethrin (pyrethroids). These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos.

Examination of a dog for ticks after being in a tick-infested area is an important precautionary measure to take in the prevention of Lyme disease. Key spots to examine include the head, neck, and ears.

In dogs, a serious long-term prognosis may result in glomerular disease, which is a category of kidney damage that may cause chronic kidney disease. Dogs may also experience chronic joint disease if the disease is left untreated. However, the majority of cases of Lyme disease in dogs result in complete recovery with, and sometimes without, treatment with antibiotics. In rare cases, Lyme disease can be fatal to both humans and dogs.

=== Cats ===
Unlike dogs, it is very rare for a cat to be infected with Lyme disease. However, cats are nevertheless capable of being infected with &quot;B. burgdorferi ,&quot; following a bite from an infected tick. Cats who are infected with Lyme Disease may show symptoms including but not limited to lameness, fatigue, or loss of appetite. In two cases, the infected cats experienced cardiac irregularities similar to symptoms of Lyme in both dogs and humans. However, cats who are infected with Lyme disease are likely to be asymptomatic, and show no noticeable signs of the disease. Cats with Lyme are often treated with antibiotics, much like other animals. In some cases, additional treatment or therapy may be required.

=== Horses ===
Lyme disease in horses is often challenging to diagnose because symptoms vary widely. Common acute symptoms include weight loss, fever, lameness, ataxia, and other muscle and joint-related issues. Additional symptoms include muscle tenderness, swollen joints, arthritis, and neck stiffness. Chronic symptoms of the disease typically include neurological manifestations, such as meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis, and encephalitis. Furthermore, it is important to note that some horses do not slow clinical signs of Lyme disease.

There are three main testing strategies used to diagnose horses with Lyme disease. They include clinical evaluation, serological testing, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Detection of specific antibodies against &quot;B. burgdorferi&quot; alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis of equine Lyme disease and unspecific testing for antibodies is not recommended.

Typical treatment involves antibiotics such as oxytetracycline, doxycycline, ceftriaxone, or minocycline. In some cases, a combination of antibiotics may be administered. Doxycycline and minocycline are taken orally, while oxytetracycline and ceftriaxone are usually administered intravenously. The duration and dosage of treatment vary widely among cases. In most cases, the infected horse is euthanized. Death of horses as a result of &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot; infection remains unknown.

Currently, there is no approved Lyme disease vaccine for horses available. However, a study demonstrated that ponies could be protected using an aluminum adjuvanted recombinant outer-surface protein A (rOspA) vaccine. While horses have been administered a Lyme disease vaccine designed for dogs, it elicits only a short-lasting antibody response. Another study supports the use of commercial Lyme disease vaccines, showing that they do elicit an antibody response, which can be significantly enhanced when horses receive an additional booster vaccine.

<text>Lorazepam, sold under the brand name Ativan among others, is a benzodiazepine medication. It is used to treat anxiety (including anxiety disorders), trouble sleeping, severe agitation, active seizures including status epilepticus, alcohol withdrawal, and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. It is also used during surgery to interfere with memory formation, to sedate those who are being mechanically ventilated, and, along with other treatments, for acute coronary syndrome due to cocaine use. It can be given orally (by mouth), transdermally (on the skin via a topical gel or patch), intravenously (IV) (injection into a vein), or intramuscularly (injection into a muscle.) When given by injection, onset of effects is between one and thirty minutes and effects last for up to a day.
Common side effects include weakness, sleepiness, ataxia, decreased alertness, decreased memory formation, low blood pressure, and a decreased effort to breathe. When given intravenously, the person should be closely monitored. Among those who are depressed, there may be an increased risk of suicide. With long-term use, larger doses may be required for the same effect. Physical dependence and psychological dependence may also occur. If stopped suddenly after long-term use, benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may occur. Older people more often develop adverse effects. In this age group, lorazepam is associated with falls and hip fractures. Due to these concerns, lorazepam use is generally recommended only for up to four weeks.
Lorazepam was initially patented in 1963 and went on sale in the United States in 1977. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 80th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
===Anxiety===
Lorazepam is used in the short-term management of severe anxiety. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises against use of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam for longer than four weeks. It is fast-acting, and useful in treating fast-onset anxiety and panic attacks.

Lorazepam can effectively reduce agitation and induce sleep, and the duration of effects from a single dose makes it an appropriate choice for the short-term treatment of insomnia, especially in the presence of severe anxiety or night terrors. It has a fairly short duration of action.

Withdrawal symptoms, including rebound insomnia and rebound anxiety, may occur after seven days of use of lorazepam.

===Seizures===

Intravenous diazepam or lorazepam are first-line treatments for convulsive status epilepticus. Lorazepam is more effective than diazepam and intravenous phenytoin in the treatment of status epilepticus and has a lower risk of continuing seizures that might require additional medication. However, phenobarbital has a superior success rate compared to lorazepam and other drugs, at least in the elderly.

Lorazepam&#x27;s anticonvulsant properties and pharmacokinetic profile make intravenous use reliable for terminating acute seizures, but induce prolonged sedation. Orally administered benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, are occasionally used as long-term prophylactic treatment of resistant absence seizures; because of gradual tolerance to their anti-seizure effects, benzodiazepines are not considered first-line therapies. Additionally, common seizure characteristics (e.g., hypersalivation, jaw-clenching, involuntary swallowing) pose some difficulties with regard to oral administration.

Lorazepam&#x27;s anticonvulsant and central nervous system (CNS) depressant properties are useful for the treatment and prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In this setting, impaired liver function is not a hazard with lorazepam, since lorazepam does not require oxidation, in the liver or otherwise, for its metabolism. Lorazepam is noted as being the most tolerable benzodiazepine in those with advanced-stage liver disease.

===Sedation===
Lorazepam is sometimes used for individuals receiving mechanical ventilation. However, in critically ill people, propofol has been found to be superior to lorazepam both in effectiveness and overall cost; as a result, the use of propofol for this indication is now encouraged, whereas the use of lorazepam is discouraged.

Its relative effectiveness in preventing new memory formation, along with its ability to reduce agitation and anxiety, makes lorazepam useful as premedication. It is given before a general anesthetic to reduce the amount of anesthetic required or before unpleasant awake procedures, such as in dentistry or endoscopies, to reduce anxiety, increase compliance, and induce amnesia for the procedure. Lorazepam by mouth is given 90 to 120 minutes before procedures, and intravenous lorazepam is given as late as 10 minutes before procedures. Lorazepam is sometimes used as an alternative to midazolam in palliative sedation. In intensive care units, lorazepam is sometimes used to produce anxiolysis, hypnosis, and amnesia.

===Agitation===
Lorazepam is sometimes used as an alternative to haloperidol when there is the need for rapid sedation of violent or agitated individuals, but haloperidol plus promethazine is preferred due to better effectiveness and due to lorazepam&#x27;s adverse effects on respiratory function. However, adverse effects such as behavioral disinhibition may make benzodiazepines inappropriate for some people who are acutely psychotic. Acute delirium is sometimes treated with lorazepam, but as it can cause paradoxical effects, it is preferably given together with haloperidol. Lorazepam is absorbed relatively slowly if given intramuscularly, a common route in restraint situations.

===Other===
Catatonia with inability to speak is responsive to lorazepam. Symptoms may recur and treatment for some days may be necessary. Catatonia due to abrupt or overly rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines, as part of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, should also respond to lorazepam treatment. As lorazepam can have paradoxical effects, haloperidol is sometimes given at the same time.

It is sometimes used in chemotherapy in addition to medications used to treat nausea and vomiting (i.e., nausea and vomiting caused or worsened by psychological sensitization to the thought of being sick).

== Adverse effects ==
Many beneficial effects of lorazepam (e.g., sedative, muscle relaxant, anti-anxiety, and amnesic effects) may become adverse effects when unwanted. Adverse effects can include sedation and low blood pressure; the effects of lorazepam are increased in combination with other CNS depressants. Other adverse effects include confusion, ataxia, inhibiting the formation of new memories, pupil constriction, and hangover effects. With long-term benzodiazepine use, it is unclear whether cognitive impairments fully return to normal after stopping lorazepam use; cognitive deficits persist for at least six months after withdrawal, but longer than six months may be required for recovery of cognitive function. Lorazepam appears to have more profound adverse effects on memory than other benzodiazepines; it impairs both explicit and implicit memory. In the elderly, falls may occur as a result of benzodiazepines. Adverse effects are more common in the elderly, and they appear at lower doses than in younger people. Benzodiazepines can cause or worsen depression. Paradoxical effects can also occur, such as worsening of seizures, or paradoxical excitement; paradoxical excitement is more likely to occur in the elderly, children, those with a history of alcohol abuse, and in people with a history of aggression or anger problems. Lorazepam&#x27;s effects are dose-dependent, meaning the higher the dose, the stronger the effects (and side effects) will be. Using the smallest dose needed to achieve desired effects lessens the risk of adverse effects. Sedative drugs and sleeping pills, including lorazepam, have been associated with an increased risk of death.

Sedation is the side effect people taking lorazepam most frequently report. In a group of around 3,500 people treated for anxiety, the most common side effects complained of from lorazepam were sedation (15.9%), dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), and unsteadiness (3.4%). Side effects such as sedation and unsteadiness increased with age. Cognitive impairment, behavioral disinhibition and respiratory depression as well as hypotension may also occur.
* Paradoxical effects: In some cases, paradoxical effects can occur with benzodiazepines, such as increased hostility, aggression, angry outbursts, and psychomotor agitation. These effects are seen more commonly with lorazepam than with other benzodiazepines. Paradoxical effects are more likely to occur with higher doses, in people with pre-existing personality disorders and those with a psychiatric illness. Frustrating stimuli may trigger such reactions, though the drug may have been prescribed to help the person cope with such stress and frustration in the first place. As paradoxical effects appear to be dose-related, they usually subside on dose reduction or on complete withdrawal of lorazepam.
* Suicidality: Benzodiazepines are associated with an increased risk of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition. Higher dosages appear to confer greater risk.
* Amnesic effects: Among benzodiazepines, lorazepam has relatively strong amnesic effects, but people soon develop tolerance to this with regular use. To avoid amnesia (or excess sedation) being a problem, the initial total daily lorazepam dose should not exceed 2 mg. This also applies to use for night sedation. Five participants in a sleep study were prescribed lorazepam 4 mg at night, and the next evening, three subjects unexpectedly volunteered memory gaps for parts of that day, an effect that subsided completely after two to three days&#x27; use. Amnesic effects cannot be estimated from the degree of sedation present, since the two effects are unrelated.
* High-dose or prolonged parenterally-administered lorazepam with its associated solvent can cause propylene glycol intoxication and poisoning.

In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class.

=== Contraindications ===

Lorazepam should be avoided in people with:
* Allergy or hypersensitivity – Past hypersensitivity or allergy to lorazepam, to any benzodiazepine, or to any of the ingredients in lorazepam tablets or injections
* Respiratory failure – Benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, may depress central nervous system respiratory drive and are contraindicated in severe respiratory failure. An example would be the inappropriate use to relieve anxiety associated with acute severe asthma. The anxiolytic effects may also be detrimental to a person&#x27;s willingness and ability to fight for breath. However, if mechanical ventilation becomes necessary, lorazepam may be used to facilitate deep sedation.
* Acute intoxication – Lorazepam may interact synergistically with the effects of alcohol, narcotics, or other psychoactive substances. It should, therefore, not be administered to a drunk or intoxicated person.
* Ataxia – This is a neurological clinical sign, consisting of unsteady and clumsy motion of the limbs and torso, due to the failure of gross muscle movement coordination, most evident on standing and walking. It is the classic way in which acute alcohol intoxication may affect a person. Benzodiazepines should not be administered to people who are already ataxic.
* Acute narrow-angle glaucoma – Lorazepam has pupil-dilating effects, which may further interfere with the drainage of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye, thus worsening narrow-angle glaucoma.
* Sleep apnea – Sleep apnea may be worsened by lorazepam&#x27;s central nervous system depressant effects. It may further reduce the person&#x27;s ability to protect his or her airway during sleep.
* Myasthenia gravis – This condition is characterized by muscle weakness, so a muscle relaxant such as lorazepam may exacerbate symptoms.
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding – Lorazepam belongs to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pregnancy category D, which means it is likely to cause harm to the developing baby if taken during the first trimester of pregnancy. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether lorazepam if taken early in pregnancy results in reduced intelligence, neurodevelopmental problems, physical malformations in cardiac or facial structure, or other malformations in some newborns. Lorazepam given to pregnant women antenatally may cause floppy infant syndrome in the neonate, or respiratory depression necessitating ventilation. Regular lorazepam use during late pregnancy (the third trimester), carries a definite risk of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate. Neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal may include hypotonia, reluctance to suck, apneic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth. Lorazepam may also inhibit fetal liver bilirubin glucuronidation, leading to neonatal jaundice. Lorazepam is present in breast milk, so caution must be exercised about breastfeeding.

=== Specific groups ===
* Children and the elderly – The safety and effectiveness of lorazepam are not well determined in children under 18 years of age, but it is used to treat acute seizures. Dose requirements have to be individualized, especially in people who are elderly and debilitated in whom the risk of oversedation is greater. Long-term therapy may lead to cognitive deficits, especially in the elderly, which may only be partially reversible. The elderly metabolize benzodiazepines more slowly than younger people and are more sensitive to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines compared to younger individuals even at similar plasma levels. Additionally, the elderly tend to take more drugs which may interact with or enhance the effects of benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, have been found to increase the risk of falls and fractures in the elderly. As a result, dosage recommendations for the elderly are about half of those used in younger individuals and used for no longer than two weeks. Lorazepam may also be slower to clear in the elderly, leading potentially to accumulation and enhanced effects. Lorazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete, tolerance develops to these impairments.
* Liver or kidney failure – Lorazepam may be safer than most benzodiazepines in people with impaired liver function. Like oxazepam, it does not require liver oxidation, but only liver glucuronidation into lorazepam-glucuronide. Therefore, impaired liver function is unlikely to result in lorazepam accumulation to an extent causing adverse reactions. Similarly kidney disease has minimal effects on lorazepam levels.
* Drug and alcohol dependence – The risk of abuse of lorazepam is increased in dependent people.
*Comorbid psychiatric disorders also increase the risk of dependence and paradoxical adverse effects.

=== Tolerance and dependence ===
Dependence typified by a withdrawal syndrome occurs in about one-third of individuals who are treated for longer than four weeks with a benzodiazepine. Higher doses and longer periods of use increase the risk of developing a benzodiazepine dependence. Potent benzodiazepines with a relatively short half-life, such as lorazepam, alprazolam, and triazolam, have the highest risk of causing dependence.

If regular treatment is continued for longer than four to six months, dose increases may be necessary to maintain effects, but treatment-resistant symptoms may in fact be benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. Due to the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects, benzodiazepines are generally not recommended for long-term use for the management of epilepsy. Increasing the dose may overcome tolerance, but tolerance may then develop to the higher dose and adverse effects may persist and worsen. The mechanism of tolerance to benzodiazepines is complex and involves GABAA receptor downregulation, alterations to subunit configuration of GABAA receptors, uncoupling, and internalization of the benzodiazepine binding site from the GABAA receptor complex as well as changes in gene expression.

The likelihood of dependence is relatively high with lorazepam compared to other benzodiazepines. Lorazepam&#x27;s relatively short serum half-life, its confinement mainly to blood, and its inactive metabolite can result in interdose withdrawal phenomena and next-dose cravings, that may reinforce psychological dependence. Because of its high potency, the smallest lorazepam tablet strength of 0.5 mg is also a significant dose. To minimise the risk of physical/psychological dependence, lorazepam is best used only short-term, at the smallest effective dose. If any benzodiazepine has been used long-term, the recommendation is a gradual dose taper over weeks, months, or longer, according to dose and duration of use, the degree of dependence and the individual.

Coming off long-term lorazepam use may be more realistically achieved by a gradual switch to an equivalent dose of diazepam and a period of stabilization on this, and only then initiating dose reductions. The advantage of switching to diazepam is that dose reductions are felt less acutely, because of the longer half-lives (20–200 hours) of diazepam and its active metabolites.

=== Withdrawal ===
On abrupt or overly rapid discontinuation of lorazepam, anxiety, and signs of physical withdrawal have been observed, similar to those seen on withdrawal from alcohol and barbiturates. Lorazepam, as with other benzodiazepine drugs, can cause physical dependence, addiction, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can, however, occur from standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible via a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen. Rebound effects often resemble the condition being treated, but typically at a more intense level and may be difficult to diagnose. Withdrawal symptoms can range from mild anxiety and insomnia to more severe symptoms such as seizures and psychosis. The risk and severity of withdrawal are increased with long-term use, use of high doses, abrupt or over-rapid reduction, among other factors. Short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are more likely to cause a more severe withdrawal syndrome compared to longer-acting benzodiazepines.

Withdrawal symptoms can occur after taking therapeutic doses of lorazepam for as little as one week. Withdrawal symptoms include headaches, anxiety, tension, depression, insomnia, restlessness, confusion, irritability, sweating, dysphoria, dizziness, derealization, depersonalization, numbness/tingling of extremities, hypersensitivity to light, sound, and smell, perceptual distortions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, appetite loss, hallucinations, delirium, seizures, tremor, stomach cramps, myalgia, agitation, palpitations, tachycardia, panic attacks, short-term memory loss, and hyperthermia. It takes about 18–36 hours for the benzodiazepine to be removed from the body. The ease of physical dependence to lorazepam, (Ativan brand was particularly cited), and its withdrawal were brought to the attention of the British public during the early 1980s in Esther Rantzen&#x27;s BBC TV series &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot;, in a feature on the drug over a number of episodes.

=== Interactions ===
Lorazepam is not usually fatal in overdose but may cause respiratory depression if taken in overdose with alcohol. The combination also causes greater enhancement of the disinhibitory and amnesic effects of both drugs, with potentially embarrassing or criminal consequences. Some experts advise that people should be warned against drinking alcohol while on lorazepam treatment, but such clear warnings are not universal.

Greater adverse effects may also occur when lorazepam is used with other drugs, such as opioids or other hypnotics. Lorazepam may also interact with rifabutin. Valproate inhibits the metabolism of lorazepam, whereas carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampin increase its rate of metabolism. Some antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opiates, antipsychotics, and alcohol, when taken with lorazepam may result in enhanced sedative effects.

=== Overdose ===

In cases of a suspected lorazepam overdose, it is important to establish whether the person is a regular user of lorazepam or other benzodiazepines since regular use causes tolerance to develop. Also, one must ascertain whether other substances were also ingested.

Signs of overdose range through mental confusion, dysarthria, paradoxical reactions, drowsiness, hypotonia, ataxia, hypotension, hypnotic state, coma, cardiovascular depression, respiratory depression, and death. However, fatal overdoses on benzodiazepines alone are rare and less common than with barbiturates. Such a difference is largely due to benzodiazepine activity as a neuroreceptor modulator, and not as an activator per se. Lorazepam and similar medications do however act in synergy with alcohol, which increases the risk of overdose.

Early management of people under alert includes emetics, gastric lavage, and activated charcoal. Otherwise, management is by observation, including vital signs, support and, only if necessary, considering the hazards of doing so, giving intravenous flumazenil.

People are ideally nursed in a kind, frustration-free environment, since, when given or taken in high doses, benzodiazepines are more likely to cause paradoxical reactions. If shown sympathy, even quite crudely feigned, people may respond solicitously, but they may respond with disproportionate aggression to frustrating cues. Opportunistic counseling has limited value here, as the person is unlikely to recall this later, owing to drug-induced anterograde amnesia.

=== Detection in body fluids ===
Lorazepam may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm poisoning in hospitalized people, provide evidence of an impaired driving arrest or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma concentrations are usually in a range of 10–300 μg/L in persons either receiving the drug therapeutically or in those arrested for impaired driving. Approximately 300–1000 μg/L is found in people after acute overdosage. Lorazepam may not be detected by commonly used urine drug screenings for benzodiazepines. This is due to the fact that the majority of these screening tests are only able to detect benzodiazepines that undergo oxazepam glucuronide metabolism.

== Pharmacology ==
Lorazepam has anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, amnesic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties. It is a high-potency and an benzodiazepine, and its uniqueness, advantages, and disadvantages are largely explained by its pharmacokinetic properties (poor water and lipid solubility, high protein binding and anoxidative metabolism to a pharmacologically inactive glucuronide form) and by its high relative potency (lorazepam 1 mg is equal in effect to diazepam 10 mg). The biological half-life of lorazepam is 10–20 hours.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Lorazepam is highly protein-bound and is extensively metabolized into pharmacologically inactive metabolites. Due to its poor lipid solubility, lorazepam is absorbed relatively slowly by mouth and is unsuitable for rectal administration. However, its poor lipid solubility and a high degree of protein binding (85–90%) mean that its volume of distribution is mainly the vascular compartment, causing relatively prolonged peak effects. This contrasts with the highly lipid-soluble diazepam, which, although rapidly absorbed orally or rectally, soon redistributes from the serum to other parts of the body, in particular, body fat. This explains why one lorazepam dose, despite its shorter serum half-life, has more prolonged peak effects than an equivalent diazepam dose. Lorazepam is rapidly conjugated at its 3-hydroxy group into lorazepam glucuronide which is then excreted in the urine. Lorazepam glucuronide has no demonstrable CNS activity in animals. The plasma levels of lorazepam are proportional to the dose given. There is no evidence of accumulation of lorazepam on administration up to six months. On regular administration, diazepam will accumulate, since it has a longer half-life and active metabolites, these metabolites also have long half-lives.

Clinical example: Diazepam has long been a drug of choice for status epilepticus; its high lipid solubility means it gets absorbed with equal speed whether given orally, or rectally (nonintravenous routes are convenient outside of hospital settings), but diazepam&#x27;s high lipid solubility also means it does not remain in the vascular space, but soon redistributes into other body tissues. So, it may be necessary to repeat diazepam doses to maintain peak anticonvulsant effects, resulting in excess body accumulation. Lorazepam is a different case; its low lipid solubility makes it relatively slowly absorbed by any route other than intravenously, but once injected, it will not get significantly redistributed beyond the vascular space. Therefore, lorazepam&#x27;s anticonvulsant effects are more durable, thus reducing the need for repeated doses. If a person is known to usually stop convulsing after only one or two diazepam doses, it may be preferable because sedative after effects will be less than if a single dose of lorazepam is given (diazepam anticonvulsant/sedative effects wear off after 15–30 minutes, but lorazepam effects last 12–24 hours). The prolonged sedation from lorazepam may, however, be an acceptable trade-off for its reliable duration of effects, particularly if the person needs to be transferred to another facility. Although lorazepam is not necessarily better than diazepam at initially terminating seizures, lorazepam is, nevertheless, replacing diazepam as the intravenous agent of choice in status epilepticus.

Lorazepam serum levels are proportional to the dose administered. Giving 2 mg oral lorazepam will result in a peak total serum level of around 20 ng/mL around two hours later, half of which is lorazepam, half its inactive metabolite, lorazepam-glucuronide. A similar lorazepam dose given intravenously will result in an earlier and higher peak serum level, with a higher relative proportion of unmetabolised (active) lorazepam. On regular administration, maximum serum levels are attained after three days. Longer-term use, up to six months, does not result in further accumulation. On discontinuation, lorazepam serum levels become negligible after three days and undetectable after about a week. Lorazepam is metabolized in the liver by conjugation into inactive lorazepam-glucuronide. This metabolism does not involve liver oxidation, so is relatively unaffected by reduced liver function. Lorazepam-glucuronide is more water-soluble than its precursor, so gets more widely distributed in the body, leading to a longer half-life than lorazepam. Lorazepam-glucuronide is eventually excreted by the kidneys, and, because of its tissue accumulation, it remains detectable, particularly in the urine, for substantially longer than lorazepam.

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Relative to other benzodiazepines, lorazepam is thought to have a high affinity for GABA receptors, which may also explain its marked amnesic effects. Its main pharmacological effects are the enhancement of the effects of the neurotransmitter GABA at the GABAA receptor. Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, enhance the effects of GABA at the GABAA receptor via increasing the frequency of opening of the chloride ion channel on the GABAA receptors; which results in the therapeutic actions of benzodiazepines. They, however, do not on their own activate the GABAA receptors but require the neurotransmitter GABA to be present. Thus, the effect of benzodiazepines is to enhance the effects of the neurotransmitter GABA.

The magnitude and duration of lorazepam effects are dose-related, meaning larger doses have stronger and longer-lasting effects, because the brain has spare benzodiazepine drug receptor capacity, with single, clinical doses leading only to an occupancy of some 3% of the available receptors.

The anticonvulsant properties of lorazepam and other benzodiazepines may be, in part or entirely, due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors. Sustained repetitive firing seems to be limited by the benzodiazepine effect of slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation to deactivation in mouse spinal cord cell cultures, hence prolonging the refractory period.

== Physical properties and formulations ==

Pure lorazepam is an almost white powder that is nearly insoluble in water and oil. In medicinal form, it is mainly available as tablets and a solution for injection, but, in some locations, it is also available as a skin patch, an oral solution, and a sublingual tablet.

Lorazepam tablets and syrups are administered orally. Lorazepam tablets of the Ativan brand also contain lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, polacrilin, magnesium stearate, and coloring agents (indigo carmine in blue tablets and tartrazine in yellow tablets). Lorazepam for injection formulated with polyethylene glycol 400 in propylene glycol with 2.0% benzyl alcohol as preservative.

Lorazepam injectable solution is administered either by deep intramuscular injection or by intravenous injection. The injectable solution comes in 1 mL ampoules containing 2 or 4 mg of lorazepam. The solvents used are polyethylene glycol 400 and propylene glycol. As a preservative, the injectable solution contains benzyl alcohol. Toxicity from propylene glycol has been reported in the case of a person receiving a continuous lorazepam infusion. Intravenous injections should be given slowly and they should be closely monitored for side effects, such as respiratory depression, hypotension, or loss of airway control.

Peak effects roughly coincide with peak serum levels, which occur 10 minutes after intravenous injection, up to 60 minutes after intramuscular injection, and 90 to 120 minutes after oral administration, but initial effects will be noted before this. A clinically relevant lorazepam dose will normally be effective for six to 12 hours, making it unsuitable for regular once-daily administration, so it is usually prescribed as two to four daily doses when taken regularly, but this may be extended to five or six, especially in the case of elderly people who could not handle large doses at once.

Topical formulations of lorazepam, while sometimes used as a treatment for nausea, especially in people in hospice, has been advised against by the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine for this purpose as it has not been proven effective.

== History ==

Historically, lorazepam is one of the &quot;classical&quot; benzodiazepines. Others include diazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam, flurazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. Lorazepam was first introduced by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in 1977 under the brand names Ativan and Temesta. The drug was developed by D.J. Richards, president of research. Wyeth&#x27;s original patent on lorazepam is expired in the United States.

== Society and culture ==

=== Recreational use ===

Lorazepam is also used for other purposes, such as recreational drug use, wherein it is taken to achieve a high, or when the medication is continued long-term against medical advice.

A 2006 large-scale, nationwide, US government study of pharmaceutical-related emergency department visits by SAMHSA found sedative-hypnotics are the pharmaceuticals most frequently used outside of their prescribed medical purpose in the United States, with 35% of drug-related emergency department visits involving sedative-hypnotics. In this category, benzodiazepines are most commonly used. Males and females use benzodiazepines for nonmedical purposes equally. Of drugs used in attempted suicide, benzodiazepines are the most commonly used pharmaceutical drugs, with 25% of attempted suicides involving them and lorazepam specifically being used in 3.6% of attempts. Lorazepam was the third-most-common benzodiazepine used outside of prescription in these ER visit statistics.

=== Legal status ===
Lorazepam is a Schedule IV drug under the Controlled Substances Act in the US and internationally under the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. It is a Schedule IV drug under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act in Canada. In the United Kingdom, it is a Class C, Schedule 4 Controlled Drug under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001.

=== Pricing ===
In 2000, the US drug company Mylan agreed to pay to settle accusations by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that they had raised the price of generic lorazepam by 2600% and generic clorazepate by 3200% in 1998 after having obtained exclusive licensing agreements for certain ingredients.

<doc id="244119" wikidata="Q514337" url="?curid=244119" title="Androcentrism">
<text>Androcentrism (Ancient Greek, ἀνήρ, &quot;man, male&quot;) is the practice, conscious or otherwise, of placing a masculine point of view at the center of one&#x27;s world view, culture, and history, thereby culturally marginalizing femininity. The related adjective is &quot;androcentric&quot;, while the practice of placing the feminine point of view at the center is &quot;gynocentric&quot;.

Androcentrism has been described as a pervasive form of sexism. However, it has also been described as a movement centered on, emphasizing, or dominated by males or masculine interests. 

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;androcentrism&quot; was introduced by Lester Frank Ward in his book Pure Sociology. In his approach from biology to sociology, he argued that the life evolves from gynaecocracy to androcentrism. He wrote that &quot;the male sex is viewed as primary, and the female is secondary&quot;, as a consequence of human evolution, but that in evolutionary biology, the female organism is primary as a means of procreation (1914, 292). After Charlotte Perkins Gilman heard him in a scientific debate, herself acknowledged his contribution in the preface to the first edition of her book, &quot;The Man-Made World; or, Our Androcentric Culture&quot;, published in 1911. Following the ideas of Lester Frank Ward ideas, Perkins Gilman argued that women were the dominant sex and only needed men for fertilisation. As insects and plants, women were originally primary to nature. Androcentrism was a consequence of human development in society, &quot;based on an irrational glorification of the trivial male fertilizing function, had “resulted in arresting the development of half the world.” Therefore, androcentrism can be understood as a societal fixation on masculinity from which all things originate. Under androcentrism, masculinity is normative and all things outside of masculinity are defined as &quot;other&quot;. According to Perkins Gilman, masculine patterns of life and masculine mindsets claimed universality while female patterns were considered as deviance. She used these ideas in her essay &quot;The Man-Made World&quot; and her fictional book Herland, where an isolated group of women still remain in a gynecological society. In Herland, this community based on feminine principles is perfectly harmonious, rather than the current conflict-ridden androcentric society.

== Science ==
Until the 19th century, women were effectively barred from higher education in Western countries. For over 300 years, Harvard admitted only white men from prominent families. Many universities, such as for example the University of Oxford, consciously practiced a numerus clausus and restricted the number of female undergraduates they accepted. Due to the latter, access of women to university and academic life, the participation of women in fundamental research is marginal. The basic principles in sciences, even human sciences, are hence predominantly formed by men.

== Medicine ==
There is a gender health data gap and women are systematically discriminated against and misdiagnosed in medicine. Early medical research has been carried out nearly exclusively on male corpses. Women were considered &quot;small men&quot; and not investigated. To this day, clinical studies are frequently confirmed for both sexes even though only men have participated and the female body is often not considered in animal tests, even when &quot;women diseases&quot; are concerned. However, female and male bodies differ, all the way up to the cell level. The same diseases can have different symptoms in the sexes, calling for different treatment, and medicines can work completely differently, including different side effects. Since male symptoms are much more prominent, women are symptomatically under- and misdiagnosed, and have for example a 50% increased risk to die from a heart attack. Here, the male and known symptoms are chest-, and shoulder pain, the female symptoms are upper abdominal pain and nausea.

== Literature ==
Research by Dr. David Anderson and Dr. Mykol Hamilton has documented the under-representation of female characters in a sample of 200 books that included top-selling children&#x27;s books from 2001 and a seven-year sample of Caldecott award-winning books. There were nearly twice as many male main characters as female main characters, and male characters appeared in illustrations 53 percent more than female characters. Most of the plot-lines centered on the male characters and their experiences of life.

== The arts ==

In 1985, a group of female artists from New York, the Guerrilla Girls, began to protest the under-representation of female artists. According to them, male artists and the male viewpoint continued to dominate the visual art world. In a 1989 poster (displayed on NYC buses) titled &quot;Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?&quot; they reported that less than 5% of the artists in the Modern Art sections of the Met Museum were women, but 85% of the nudes were female.

Over 20 years later, women were still under-represented in the art world. In 2007, Jerry Saltz (journalist from the New York Times) criticized the Museum of Modern Art for undervaluing work by female artists. Of the 400 works of art he counted in the Museum of Modern Art, only 14 were by women (3.5%). Saltz also found a significant under-representation of female artists in the six other art institutions he studied.

== Generic male language ==

In literature, the use of masculine language to refer to men, women, intersex, and non-binary people may indicate a male or androcentric bias in society where men are seen as the &#x27;norm&#x27;, and women, intersex, and non-binary people are seen as the &#x27;other&#x27;. Philosophy scholar Jennifer Saul argues that the use of male generic language marginalizes women, intersex, and non-binary people in society. In recent years, some writers have started to use more gender-inclusive language (for instance, using the pronouns they/them and using gender-inclusive words like humankind, person, partner, spouse, businessperson, firefighter, chairperson, and police officer).

Many studies have shown that male generic language is not interpreted as truly gender-inclusive. Psychological research has shown that, in comparison to unbiased terms such as &quot;they&quot; and &quot;humankind&quot;, masculine terms lead to male-biased mental imagery in the mind of both the listener and the communicator.

Three studies by Mykol Hamilton show that there is not only a male → people bias but also a people → male bias. In other words, a masculine bias remains even when people are exposed to only gender neutral language (although the bias is lessened). In two of her studies, half of the participants (after exposure to gender neutral language) had male-biased imagery but the rest of the participants displayed no gender bias at all. In her third study, only males showed a masculine-bias (after exposure to gender neutral language) – females showed no gender bias. Hamilton asserted that this may be due to the fact that males have grown up being able to think more easily than females of &quot;any person&quot; as generic &quot;he,&quot; since &quot;he&quot; applies to them. Further, of the two options for neutral language, neutral language that explicitly names women (e.g., &quot;he or she&quot;) reduces androcentrism more effectively than neutral language that makes no mention of gender whatsoever (e.g., &quot;human&quot;).

Feminist anthropologist Sally Slocum argues that there has been a longstanding male bias in anthropological thought as evidenced by terminology used when referring to society, culture, and humankind. According to Slocum, &quot;All too often the word &#x27;man&#x27; is used in such an ambiguous fashion that it is impossible to decide whether it refers to males or just the human species in general, including both males and females.&quot;

Men&#x27;s language will be judged as the &#x27;norm&#x27; and anything that women do linguistically will be judged negatively against this. The speech of a socially subordinate group will be interpreted as linguistically inadequate against that used by socially dominant groups. It has been found that women use more hedges and qualifiers than men. Feminine speech has been viewed as more tentative and has been deemed powerless speech. This is based on the view that masculine speech is the standard.

== Generic male symbols ==
On the Internet, many avatars are gender-neutral (such as an image of a smiley face). However, when an avatar is human and discernibly gendered, it usually appears to be a man.

Depictions of skeletons typically have male anatomy rather than female, even when the character of the skeleton is meant to be female.

Restroom symbols show the male as the default person, while the female is identified by a skirt.

Lions are often portrayed in fiction as patriarchal and thought of as &quot;King of the Jungle,&quot; despite being led by females.

== Impacts ==
Men are more severely impacted by androcentric thinking. However, the ideology has substantial effects on the way of thinking of everyone within it. In a 2022 study, in which 3815 people were shown a selection of 256 images containing illusory faces (objects, in which humans see faces), 90% of the objects were on average by the participants identified as male.

<text>Bossa nova () is a relaxed style of samba developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is mainly characterized by a calm syncopated rhythm with chords and fingerstyle mimicking the beat of a samba groove, as if it was a simplification and stylization on the guitar of the rhythm produced by a samba school band. Another defining characteristic of the style is the use of unconventional chords in some cases with complex progressions and &quot;ambiguous&quot; harmonies. A common misconception is that these complex chords and harmonies were derived from jazz, but samba guitar players have been using similar arrangement structures since the early 1920s, indicating a case of parallel evolution of styles rather than a simple transference from jazz to bossa nova. Nevertheless, bossa nova was influenced by jazz, both in the harmonies used and also by the instrumentation of songs, and today many bossa nova songs are considered jazz standards. The popularity of bossa nova has helped to renew samba and contributed to the modernization of Brazilian music in general.

One of the major innovations of bossa nova was the way to synthesize the rhythm of samba on the classical guitar. According to musicologist Gilberto Mendes, the bossa nova was one of the &quot;three rhythmic phases of samba&quot;, in which the &quot;bossa beat&quot; had been extracted by João Gilberto from the traditional samba. The synthesis performed by Gilberto&#x27;s guitar was a reduction of the &quot;batucada&quot; of samba, a stylization produced from one of the percussion instruments: the thumb stylized a surdo; the index, middle and ring fingers phrased like a tamborim. In line with this thesis, musicians such as Baden Powell, Roberto Menescal, and Ronaldo Bôscoli also understand the bossa nova beat as being extracted from the tamborim play in the bateria.

==Etymology==

In Brazil, the word is old-fashioned slang for something done with particular charm, natural flair or innate ability. As early as 1932, Noel Rosa used the word in a samba:
: (&quot;Samba, readiness and other are our things, are things from us.&quot;)

The phrase , translated literally, means &quot;new trend&quot; or &quot;new wave&quot; in Portuguese. The exact origin of the term remained unclear for many decades, according to some authors. Within the artistic beach culture of the late 1950s in Rio de Janeiro, the term was used to refer to any new &quot;trend&quot; or &quot;fashionable wave&quot;. In his book &quot;Bossa Nova&quot;, Brazilian author Ruy Castro asserts that was already in use in the 1950s by musicians as a word to characterize someone&#x27;s knack for playing or singing idiosyncratically. 

Castro claims that the term might have first been used in public for a concert given in 1957 by the (&#x27;Hebrew University Group of Brazil&#x27;). The authorship of the term is attributed to the then-young journalist Moyses Fuks, who was promoting the event. That group consisted of Sylvia Telles, Carlos Lyra, Nara Leão, Luiz Eça, Roberto Menescal, and others. Mr Fuks&#x27;s description, fully supported by most of the bossa nova members, simply read (&quot;Today. Sylvia Telles and a &#x27;Bossa Nova&#x27; group&quot;), since Sylvia Telles was the most famous musician in the group at that time. 

In 1959, Nara Leão also participated in more than one embryonic display of bossa nova. These include the 1st Festival de Samba Session, conducted by the student union of . This session was chaired by Carlos Diegues (later a prominent Cinema Novo film director), a law student whom Leão ultimately married.

==History ==
In 1959, the soundtrack to the film &quot;Black Orpheus&quot; (Orfeu Negro) was released, which included the future Manhã de Carnaval, &quot;The Morning of the Carnival&quot;. The style emerged at the time when samba-canção was the dominant rhythm in the Brazilian music scene. Its first appearance was on the album &quot;Canção do Amor Demais&quot;, in which the singer Elizeth Cardoso recorded two compositions by the duo Antônio Carlos Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes, &quot;Outra Vez&quot; and &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot;, which were accompanied by João Gilberto&#x27;s guitar. It was the first time that the Bahian musician presented the beat of his guitar that would become characteristic of the style. By accompanying Cardoso&#x27;s voice, Gilberto innovated in the way of pacing the rhythm, accentuating the weak times, to carry out a synthesis of the beat of samba to guitar.

In 1959, João Gilberto&#x27;s bossa album was released, containing the tracks &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot; and &quot;Bim Bom&quot;. Considered the landmark of the birth of bossa nova, it also featured Gilberto&#x27;s innovative way of singing samba, which was inspired by Dorival Caymmi. With the LP &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot;, released in 1959, Gilberto consolidated the bossa nova as a new style of playing samba. His innovative way of playing and singing samba, combined with the harmonies of Antônio Carlos Jobim and the lyrics of Vinicius de Moraes, found immediate resonance among musicians who were looking for new approaches to samba in Rio de Janeiro, many of them were influenced by American jazz. 

In 1964, João Gilberto and Stan Getz released the &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; album. Then, it emerged an artistic movement around Gilberto and other professional artists such as Jobim, Moraes and Baden Powell, among others, which attracted young amateur musicians from the South Zone of Rio – such as Carlos Lyra, Roberto Menescal, Ronaldo Bôscoli and Nara Leão. Jorge Ben wrote &quot;Mas que Nada&quot; in 1963, and Sérgio Mendes &amp; Brazil 66 gained a bossa rock hit &quot;Mas que Nada&quot; in 1966. It was inducted to the Latin Grammy Hall of Fame. In the 1960s, US jazz artists such as Stan Getz, Hank Mobley, Dave Brubeck, Zoot Sims, Paul Winter and Quincy Jones recorded bossa jazz albums.

Bossa nova continues to influence popular music around the world, from the 1960s to today. An example is the song &quot;Break on Through (To the Other Side)&quot; by American rock band The Doors, especially the drum beat. Drummer John Densmore has stated that he was very influenced by the sounds of Brazil when coming up with the drum part for the song. A more recent reference is the Icelandic jazz pop singer Laufey and her hit song &quot;From The Start&quot;, with its bossa nova infused rhythm.

==Instruments==
===Classical guitar===
Bossa nova is most commonly performed on the nylon-string classical guitar, played with the fingers rather than with a pick. Its purest form could be considered unaccompanied guitar with vocals, as created, pioneered, and exemplified by João Gilberto. Even in larger, jazz-like arrangements for groups, there is almost always a guitar that plays the underlying rhythm. Gilberto basically took one of the several rhythmic layers from a samba ensemble, specifically the tamborim, and applied it to the picking hand. According to Brazilian musician Paulo Bittencourt, João Gilberto, known for his eccentricity and obsessed by the idea of finding a new way of playing the guitar, sometimes locked himself in the bathroom, where he played one and the same chord for many hours in a row.
===Drums and percussion===
As in samba, the surdo plays an ostinato figure on the downbeat of beat one, the &quot;ah&quot; of beat one, the downbeat of beat two and the &quot;ah&quot; of beat two. The clave pattern sounds very similar to the two-three or three-two son clave of Cuban styles such as mambo but is dissimilar in that the &quot;two&quot; side of the clave is pushed by an eighth note. Also important in the percussion section for bossa nova is the cabasa, which plays a steady sixteenth-note pattern. These parts are easily adaptable to the drum set, which makes bossa nova a rather popular Brazilian style for drummers.

==Structure==
Certain other instrumentations and vocals are also part of the structure of bossa nova. These include:

===Bossa nova and samba===

Bossa nova has at its core a rhythm based on samba. Samba combines the rhythmic patterns and feel originating in afro-Brazilian slave communities. Samba&#x27;s emphasis on the second beat carries through to bossa nova (to the degree that it is often notated in 2/4 time). However, unlike samba, bossa nova has no dance steps to accompany it. When played on the guitar, in a simple one-bar pattern, the thumb plays the bass notes on 1 and 2, while the fingers pluck the chords in unison on the two eighth notes of beat one, followed by the second sixteenth note of beat two. Two-measure patterns usually contain a syncopation into the second measure. Syncopation is a common feature of bossa nova, giving it its distinct &quot;swaying&quot; motion. While jazz music, which is typically swung, also contains syncopation, bossa nova is typically played without swing, contrasting with jazz. As bossa nova composer Carlos Lyra describes it in his song &quot;Influência do Jazz&quot;, the samba rhythm moves &quot;side to side&quot; while jazz moves &quot;front to back&quot;. There&#x27;s also some evidence indicating a musical influence of blues in bossa nova, even thought this effect is not immediately recognized in the genre structure.

===Vocals===
Aside from the guitar style, João Gilberto&#x27;s other innovation was the projection of the singing voice. Prior to bossa nova, Brazilian singers employed brassy, almost operatic styles. Now, the characteristic nasal vocal production of bossa nova is a peculiar trait of the caboclo folk tradition of northeastern Brazil.

===Themes and lyrics===
The lyrical themes found in bossa nova include women, love, longing, homesickness, and nature. Bossa Nova was often apolitical. The musical lyrics of the late 1950s depicted the easy life of middle to upper-class Brazilians, though the majority of the population was working class. In conjunction with political developments of the early 1960s (especially the 1964 military coup d&#x27;état), the popularity of bossa nova was eclipsed by , a musical genre that appeared around the mid-1960s, featuring lyrics that were more politically charged and focused on the working class struggle.

==Dance==
Bossa nova was also a fad dance that corresponded to the music. It was introduced in the late 1950s and faded out in the mid-sixties. Bossa nova music, with its soft, sophisticated vocal rhythms and improvisations, is well suited for listening but failed to become dance music despite heavy promotion in the 1960s. The style of basic dance steps suited the music well. It was danced on &quot;soft&quot; knees that allowed for sideways sways with hip motions and it could be danced both solo and in pairs. About ten various simple step patterns were published.

A variant of basic 8-beat pattern was: &quot;step forward, tap, step back, step together, repeat from the opposite foot&quot;. A variation of this pattern was a kind of slow samba walk, with &quot;step together&quot; above replaced by &quot;replace&quot;. Box steps of rhumba and whisk steps of nightclub two step could be fitted with bossa-nova styling. Embellishments included placing one arm onto one&#x27;s own belly and waving another arm at waist level in the direction of the sway, possibly with a finger click.

<text>William Richards Bennett, (April 14, 1932 – December 3, 2015) was a Canadian politician who was the 27th premier of British Columbia from 1975 to 1986.

== Early life ==
Bennett was the son of Annie Elizabeth May (Richards) and former premier W. A. C. Bennett. His father was also named William but was usually called &quot;W. A. C.&quot; in the media or &quot;Cece&quot; by his friends. To distinguish the son from his father, he was usually called &quot;Bill.&quot;

==Career==
Following his father&#x27;s resignation, Bill Bennett was elected on September 7, 1973, as the British Columbia Social Credit Party member of the British Columbia Legislative Assembly for South Okanagan.

Bennett was elected the leader of the Socred Party in November 1973 at a convention in Whistler, British Columbia. Bennett set about establishing a political organization modelled closely on and using staff lent by Bill Davis&#x27;s Ontario &quot;Big Blue Machine.&quot; Bennett&#x27;s organization was called the &quot;Baby Blue Machine.&quot; He embraced a new coalition of Liberals, social conservatives, and the corporate sector, unlike his father, who had appealed to the populist base.

==Premier of British Columbia==
He became premier of the province in the 1975 election when his party defeated the New Democratic Party of Premier David Barrett. In the election of May 10, 1979, the Social Credit Party was re-elected with a reduced majority, followed by winning a larger majority in the 1983 election. He served until August 6, 1986.

In 1978, Bennett was instrumental in establishing the BC Winter Games and BC Summer Games. As a result, an award was named in his honour in which he presented the award in 2008 in his hometown, Kelowna, where the BC Summer Games were being hosted that year.

His cabinet included politicians such as Pat McGeer, Grace McCarthy, Bill Vander Zalm, Garde Gardom, Rafe Mair, and Jim Nielsen.

Bennett&#x27;s government spent hundreds of millions of dollars to bring Expo 86 and related projects to Vancouver, including BC Place, the city&#x27;s SkyTrain rapid transit system, and the Vancouver Trade and Convention Centre. His government also built the Coquihalla Highway at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars with non-union Kerkhoff Construction Company as the main contractor. It distributed free shares to British Columbians for the British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation (BCRIC). His government also spent over $1 billion on the Northeast coal project to create jobs.

==Controversies==
In 1996, Bill Bennett was convicted under BC securities laws of insider trading involving the sale of shares in Doman Securities, a Duncan, BC company, ten years after he stepped down as premier. That was known as the Doman Scandal. A British Columbia Securities Commission panel imposed trading sanctions against Russell James Bennett and Harbanse Singh Doman and ordered them along with Bill Bennett to pay the commission $1 million to cover the costs of an insider trading case that spanned 11 years.

British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation (BCRIC or &quot;Brick&quot;) (Social Credit Party), a holding company formed under the government of William R. Bennett, was a public boondoggle involving publicly l-distributed and soon-worthless shares of a former Crown Corporation. Shares briefly rallied and then dropped and settled at less than one dollar.

Bennett&#x27;s tenure also included megaprojects such as the Coquihalla Highway, which cost approximately $848 million.

==Retirement==
Though still reviled by the left, Bennett remains generally highly respected among conservatives in BC, who view his rule as a &quot;golden era&quot; before compared to the governments of Social Credit premier Bill Vander Zalm and the New Democratic Party premiers who succeeded him. In his later years, Bennett advised past BC Premier Gordon Campbell, who openly stated his desire to emulate the policies associated with Bennett&#x27;s government. 

In 2007, Bennett was appointed to the Order of British Columbia, BC&#x27;s highest award for achievement. The new replacement bridge across Okanagan Lake in Kelowna is named after him.

==Illness and death==
Bennett was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease around 2007 and, in his later years, lived in a long-term care facility. He died on December 3, 2015, at the age of 83.

<text>William Andrew Cecil Bennett (September 6, 1900 – February 23, 1979) was a Canadian politician who served as the 25th premier of British Columbia from 1952 to 1972. With just over 20 years in office, Bennett remains the longest-serving premier in British Columbia history. He was a member of the Social Credit Party (Socreds). 

Notable achievements by the Bennett government included the adoption of BC&#x27;s first provincial flag, the establishment of the second Bank of British Columbia, and the creation of BC Hydro and BC Ferries. Bennett led the Socreds to a total of seven consecutive election victories. Though he led the party to defeat in the 1972 election, his son Bill Bennett led it to victory in the 1975 election and served as premier until 1986.

==Early and family life==
Bennett was born in 1900 in Hastings, New Brunswick, Canada, one of five children of Andrew Havelock Bennett and Mary Emma Burns. His father was a third cousin of Richard Bedford Bennett, eleventh Prime Minister of Canada.

Bennett left formal school in grade nine, during the First World War, to take a job in a hardware store. As an adult, he pursued correspondence courses to improve his knowledge and job potential. He joined the Air Force, but the war ended before he saw active duty. At the age of 18, he and his family moved to Edmonton, Alberta, and then to Westlock, Alberta, where Bennett&#x27;s father operated a hardware store.

In 1927 Bennett married Annie Elizabeth May Richards. In 1930 they moved to Victoria, and then Kelowna with their two children, Anita and R.J. A third child, William, was born in 1932. In Kelowna, Bennett joined such fraternal organizations as the local Gyro Club, Masonic Lodge, and the Kelowna Club, and was active with his family in the United Church of Canada.

He was usually referred to as W. A. C. Bennett, although some referred to him either affectionately or mockingly as &quot;Wacky&quot; Bennett. To his close friends, he was known as &quot;Cece&quot;.

==Early business career==
Bennett opened a hardware store in 1927, in partnership with another man, and married May Bennett soon afterwards. Bennett was able to sell his interest just before the 1929 Stock Market crash. He decided to leave the tough Alberta economic conditions and moved with his family to the Okanagan Valley, in the interior of British Columbia, settling in Kelowna. There he opened his own hardware store, known as Bennett&#x27;s Hardware. A successful merchant, he served as President of the Kelowna Board of Trade from 1937 to 1939.

In 1932 Bennett, Giuseppe Guezzi, and Pasquale &quot;Cap&quot; Capozzi established a wine-making company to produce wine from the vast surplus of Okanagan apples that were going to waste during the Depression. Three years later Bennett and Capozzi, both teetotalers, concluded that there was no market for their apple wines. They switched to making wines from California grapes. In 1936 they established Calona Wines, the name a phonetic spelling of Kelowna. Bennett departed the company in 1940 to enter politics.

==Enters politics==
Bennett joined the British Columbia Conservative Party. He ran for the South Okanagan nomination for the 1937 provincial election for the British Columbia Legislative Assembly, but was unsuccessful. In 1941, he won the Conservative Party nomination and the general election. Following that election, the Conservative and Liberal parties voted to govern in coalition.

As a coalitionist, Bennett was re-elected in 1945. He resigned the seat in 1948 in order to run as Progressive Conservative candidate in the Yale federal by-election of that year, but did not win. Regaining the Coalition nomination for the South Okanagan seat, Bennett was returned to the British Columbia Legislative Assembly in the 1949 provincial election.

After failing in his bid to become leader of the provincial Progressive Conservative Party in 1951, Bennett left the party to sit as an independent member. In December of that year, he took out a membership in the Social Credit League.

==Premier of British Columbia==

Commencing with the 1952 provincial election, the province used an alternative vote system designed by the Conservative and Liberal parties to keep the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation out of power. However, the Liberal and Conservative parties were not at all as popular among voters as expected. The combined Liberal and PC vote total was 120,000 fewer votes than in the previous election, while the Social Credit party received almost 200,000 more votes than in 1949. Even if Liberal and Conservative voters had given their second choices strictly to the other party, the old coalition still would not have taken a majority of seats. Only in eight districts did supporters of the two parties together form majority. In the election, often Liberal and Conservative voters&#x27; second preference was marked for Social Credit candidates. As well, the CCF&#x27;s second preferences were overwhelmingly for Social Credit candidates.

The Social Credit party won 19 seats of the total of 48, and became the largest party represented in the Assembly and formed a minority government. The Socreds (as they were informally known) convinced an Independent Labour Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) to support them as well.

Not even the Socreds had expected to win the election. They entered the campaign without a full-time leader; their nominal leader was Ernest George Hansell, a federal MP from Alberta. Party president Lyle Wicks convened a meeting of the newly elected MLAs to elect British Columbia&#x27;s new premier. Bennett, one of only three Socred MLAs who had any previous experience in the legislature, was elected party leader and premier-designate on July 15, 1952. Of the 19 votes cast, Bennett received 10, another candidate received 2, and two more (including Philip Gaglardi) one vote each.
On August 1, Bennett was sworn in as Premier of British Columbia; he was repeatedly reelected and served for 20 years. In order to get a stronger mandate, Bennett deliberately engineered the defeat of his initial minority government; he forced an election for June 1953 based on a school funding proposal. After Social Credit was re-elected with a clear majority in 1953, Bennett abandoned the preferential voting method.

The Social Credit Party won seven consecutive elections during W. A. C. Bennett&#x27;s involvement and leadership: 1952, 1953, 1956, 1960, 1963, 1966, and 1969. The only election Bennett lost as a member of Social Credit was in 1972, the last election in which he was a candidate.

As premier during election season he would often warn the public &quot;the socialist hordes are at the gates, my friend.&quot;

===Political ideology===
While the Social Credit party was founded to promote the social credit theories of monetary reform, these could not be implemented at the provincial level, as the Alberta Social Credit Party had learned in the 1930s. Bennett quickly converted the provincial party into a populist conservative party. It was devoted to keeping the CCF out of power. But, as leader of the Social Credit Party of Canada&#x27;s second most powerful provincial branch, Bennett spoke for the party in federal election campaigns. During the 1957 election, he spoke for the party at a rally in Regina, Saskatchewan. In the 1965 election, Bennett and his cabinet ministers toured BC to encourage voters to elect Social Credit MPs to promote BC&#x27;s interests.

The cabinets of the Bennett governments over 20 years had several memorable ministers, including the flamboyant &quot;Flying Phil&quot; Gaglardi. He oversaw the rapid construction and expansion of highways throughout the province and a similar expansion of BC Ferries.

In 1960, the Bennett government introduced British Columbia&#x27;s first provincial flag, the first official provincial flag adopted west of Quebec.

===Financial policy===
A fiscal conservative, Bennett served also as the Minister of Finance, keeping tight control over government spending. He led his province into an era of modernization and prosperity.
His practice of &quot;pay as you go&quot; carefully tracked spending, and transferred debts to other government agencies. In 1959 Bennett announced that the province was debt free.

===Government expansion===
Bennett&#x27;s governments nationalized certain industries, creating provincial Crown corporations, including BC Ferries (1960) and BC Hydro (1961). BC Rail, formerly the Pacific Great Eastern Railway and owned by the province since 1918, had a series of major expansions to stimulate development. He also ensured investment in other infrastructure. Minister of Highways, Phil Gaglardi, oversaw major highway expansions and improvements. Major hydro-electric dam-building projects were undertaken on the Columbia and Peace Rivers. Bennett was instrumental in establishing the Bank of British Columbia, in which the government took a 25% ownership.

In 1955 Bennett advocated for a universal medical, dental, hospital, and pharmaceutical insurance coverage. The federal government introduced universal, publicly funded medical and hospital insurance as part of what became known as Medicare. The provincial government introduced a retail sales tax to fund the program.

In the 1960s, there was an expansion of higher education: Post-secondary education institutions were created and expanded. BC gained its second and third degree-granting universities: the University of Victoria in 1963 and Simon Fraser University in 1965.

===Columbia River Treaty===
In 1961 Canada and the United States signed the Columbia River Treaty to jointly manage this important resource. While the signatories were the federal governments of Canada and the United States, Premier Bennett was reported to have played a major part in the negotiations. Under treaty provisions, the U.S. paid British Columbia C$275 million (plus interest) for the downstream power generation rights over the following 30 years. BC used the money to fund construction of dams on the Columbia River for power generation and flood control.

===Intergovernmental relations===

====Federal relations====
In 1970, B.C premier W. A. C. Bennett mused that Trudeau&#x27;s government is &quot;Quebec nationalist&quot;-oriented. He also implied that Quebec received special treatment from Ottawa as a result of this arrangement. 

Furthermore, B.C. premier W. A. C. Bennett believed that Pierre Trudeau implemented bilingualism because he was a Quebec‐oriented politician who was mainly interested in promoting and protecting French Canada. During an off the cuff remark at an Ontario Liberal rally, Pierre Trudeau referred to Bennett as a &quot;bigot who thinks there are too many French people in Ottawa.&quot;

Bennett proposed that Canada be considered as a group of regions instead of provinces: Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Western Canada, and BC. He also proposed that the four western provinces be expanded north, with BC absorbing the Yukon Territory. Although there was no formal reorganization of jurisdictions, the concept of different regions, instead of provinces, has become part of how Canadians discuss the country.

BC hosted the 1971 constitutional conference in Victoria. From this emerged the Victoria Charter, the most far-reaching federal-provincial agreement on constitutional amendment since Confederation. Bennett advocated that BC should have a veto over constitutional amendments, along with Ontario and Quebec.

During a 1977 interview with Peter Gzowski, Bennett claimed that most premiers were in agreement about the negative aspects of equalization payments. Bennett believed that they led to more government &quot;bureaucracy&quot;. Bennett favoured direct payments to those in need and advocated for negative income taxes or guaranteed income. Bennett took this proposal to the premier of Quebec and prime minister Trudeau.

====BC-Quebec relations====
Bennett on more than one occasion said &quot;British Columbia [is] the best friend that Quebec&#x27;s got&quot;.

In 1964, the Province of British Columbia provided the Province of Quebec with a $100 million loan. $60 million from that loan went to Hydro-Québec. The loan faced controversy in the Quebec legislature.

In 1967 the premier proposed that Quebecers should vote on whether or not they want to stay in Canada and that the referendum should ask &quot;one simple question&quot;.

==Post-premiership==
Following his party&#x27;s defeat in the 1972 election by Dave Barrett&#x27;s revitalized New Democratic Party (the successor to the CCF), he served as Leader of the Opposition until resigning his seat as member for South Okanagan in June 1973.

His son, W.R. &quot;Bill&quot; Bennett, won the South Okanagan by-election in September. W. A. C. Bennett retired as leader of the Social Credit Party on November 15, and his son Bill Bennett was elected leader of the BC Social Credit Party on November 24, 1973. NDP Premier Dave Barrett dropped the writ and sought re-election in the fall of 1975, the Socreds were returned to power with 35 seats in the 55-seat Legislature, and W. A. C.&#x27;s son Bill became the new Premier of British Columbia, inheriting his father&#x27;s mantle of power as well as many of his father&#x27;s cabinet members.

In 1976, W. A. C. Bennett was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He died in 1979, and was interred in the Kelowna Municipal Cemetery, in Kelowna, British Columbia.

In 1998, the Government of Canada honoured W. A. C. Bennett with his portrait on a postage stamp of Canada. The W. A. C. Bennett Dam near Hudson&#x27;s Hope, built under the Two River Policy, is named after him. The library at the Burnaby campus of Simon Fraser University also bears his name. He was featured on the cover of &quot;Time Magazine&quot; on September 30, 1966.

<text>Macclesfield () is a market town and civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire East, Cheshire, England. It is sited on the River Bollin and the edge of the Cheshire Plain, with Macclesfield Forest to its east; the town lies south of Manchester and east of Chester.

Before the Norman Conquest, Macclesfield was held by Edwin, Earl of Mercia and was assessed at £8. The medieval town grew up on the hilltop around what is now St Michael&#x27;s Church. It was granted a municipal charter in 1261. Macclesfield Grammar School was founded in 1502. The town had a silk-button industry from at least the middle of the 17th century and became a major silk-manufacturing centre from the mid-18th century. The Macclesfield Canal was constructed in 1826–31. 

Hovis breadmakers were another Victorian employer; modern industries include pharmaceuticals, such as Astra Zeneca. Multiple mill buildings are still standing and several of the town&#x27;s museums explore the local silk industry. Other landmarks include Georgian buildings such as the Town Hall and former Sunday School; St Alban&#x27;s Church, designed by Augustus Pugin; and the Arighi Bianchi furniture shop.

At the 2021 census the population of the parish was 52,496 and the population of the built up area was 54,345. A person from the town is referred to as a &quot;Maxonian&quot;.

== Toponymy ==
The town is recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Maclesfeld&quot; and in 1183 it was referred to as &quot;Makeslesfeld&quot;. The English Place-Name Society gives its name as being derived from the Old English name, &quot;Maccel&quot;, and &quot;field&quot;, yielding the meaning &quot;Maccel&#x27;s open country&quot;.

Although &quot;Silk Town&quot; seems to be its preferred nickname, the traditional nickname of Macclesfield is &quot;Treacle Town&quot;.
This refers to an historical incident when a horse-drawn wagon overturned and spilt its load of treacle onto the street, after which the poor scooped the treacle off the road.

== History ==
Before the Norman Conquest, Macclesfield was held by Edwin, Earl of Mercia, who also held much of the east of the county. Three crosses survive from this period, originally located in Sutton and now in West Park, and J. D. Bu&#x27;Lock speculates that there might have been a Pre-Conquest church. The area was devastated by the Normans in 1070, and had not recovered by 1086; the Domesday Book records the manor as having fallen in value from £8 to 20 shillings. Hugh d&#x27;Avranches, Earl of Chester held the manor himself after the Conquest; there was a mill, meadow for oxen, and woodland 6 leagues by 4 leagues. A Norman castle was built at Macclesfield.

At the time of the Domesday Book, Macclesfield was in the hundred of Hamestan. By the 13th century, the Hundreds of Cheshire had been reorganised, and the town gave its name to the Macclesfield Hundred, which covered a similar area to the old Hamestan Hundred in the east of the county.
Macclesfield was granted a borough charter in 1261 by Edward, Earl of Chester, eldest son of Henry III; Edward later became king as Edward I. Although the 1261 charter purported to create the borough, there was reputedly an earlier charter, possibly granted by Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, in the early 13th century. The 1261 charter gave the right to hold a market, fair and judicial courts. The medieval town stood on the hilltop, centred on All Saints&#x27; Church (later renamed St Michael&#x27;s), which was built in 1278, an extension of a chapel built in approximately 1220. In 1357, a hall was built in the town for the mayor&#x27;s court and the borough court (portmote). The town lacked industries at this date and was described as poor, remaining a small market town until the end of the 15th century, with a population numbered in the hundreds.

The Cheshire archers were a body of elite soldiers noted for their skills with the longbow that fought in many engagements in Britain and France in the Middle Ages. Battles at which there were sizeable numbers of Cheshire archers include Agincourt and Crecy. In 1277 Edward I employed 100 of these archers from the Macclesfield area as his personal bodyguard, his successor Richard II also employed a bodyguard of these yeoman archers who came from the Macclesfield Hundred and the forest districts of Cheshire.

The borough had a weekly market and two annual fairs: the Barnaby fair on St Barnabas day (11 June), the other on the feast of All Souls (2 November). In recent years the Barnaby fair has been reinvented as the Barnaby Festival, a cultural festival in mid-June. The weekly market no longer happens but on the last Sunday of each month the Treacle Market is held, a large market selling locally produced food and handmade items such as clothing, handmade goods and pottery.

Macclesfield was the administrative centre of the Hundred of Macclesfield, which occupied most of east Cheshire. The Earl of Chester&#x27;s manor of Macclesfield was very large, and its boundary extended to Disley. The manor house was on the edge of the deer park, on the west of the town. In the 14th century, it had a king&#x27;s chamber and a queen&#x27;s hall, as well as a large stable, and the manor served as a stud farm for Edward the Black Prince. The Earls of Chester established the Forest of Macclesfield, which was much larger than its present-day namesake. It was used for hunting deer and pasturing sheep and cattle. By the end of the 13th century, large areas of the forest had been ploughed because of the pressure of population growth. In 1356, two trees from the forest were given to archer William Jauderell to repair his home.
Macclesfield Castle was a fortified town house built by John de Macclesfield in the later Middle Ages. Construction began in 1398, and that year an application was made for a licence to crenellate, or fortify, the building. Two chantries were founded in the town: one in 1422 by the Legh family, and one in 1504 by Thomas Savage. In 1502, Macclesfield Grammar School was founded by Sir John Percyvale.

No proof exists that Macclesfield was ever a walled town. When the settlement was first established and for some centuries afterwards there would have certainly been some sort of ditch and palisade round the western side of the town which was not naturally defended. This was necessary in order to keep out undesirable people and stray animals. No physical trace of a ditch remains though measurements and the shape of certain streets suggest where such a ditch could have been and most of the medieval building were within this area. It is unlikely that the ditch and palisade were succeeded by a wall for no record has been found of a murage tax, which would certainly have been levied to keep the wall in repair. The suffix &quot;Gate&quot; in the names of several Macclesfield streets has been taken to indicate the former presence of a gate in the sense of a guarded opening in a wall, however, this is very unlikely as the term &#x27;gate&#x27; is derived from &#x27;gata&#x27;, Scandinavian for road, which became gate in Middle English. Therefore, Chester Gate, the Jordan Gate and the Church Wall Gate (some sources give the name Well Gate for this gate), are simply referring to the road to/from Chester or the road leading from the church to the well. These names are preserved in the names of three streets in the town, Chestergate, Jordangate and Back Wallgate, which have several older and listed buildings.

A charter of 1595 established a town governing body consisting of the mayor, two aldermen and 24 &quot;capital burgesses&quot;, and the powers of this body were increased by a charter of 1684. By the Tudor era, Macclesfield was prospering, with industries including the manufacture of harnesses, gloves and especially buttons, and later ribbons, tapes and fancy ware. Coal was mined from the 16th century. In 1664, the population was around 2,600, making Macclesfield the third-largest town in the county, after Chester and Nantwich, although the town had expanded little from its medieval extent and had fewer large houses than Nantwich and Stockport. By around 1720, the number of households had increased to 925, and this rapid population growth continued throughout the 18th century, reaching 8,743 in 1801.

In the 1580s, Macclesfield was one of the earliest towns in the county to have Puritan preaching &quot;Exercises&quot;, and it was also an early centre for the Quakers. By 1718 an estimated 10% of the population was Nonconformist. Towards the end of that century, the town had a large Methodist congregation, and Christ Church was the only Anglican church in the county to invite John Wesley to preach.
During the Civil War, in 1642 the town was occupied for the King by Sir Thomas Aston, a Royalist. In the Jacobite Rising of 1745, Charles Stuart and his army marched through Macclesfield as they attempted to reach London. The mayor was forced to welcome the prince, and the event is commemorated in one of the town&#x27;s silk tapestries. Cumberland House on Jordangate is so named after the Duke of Cumberland who stayed there in 1745 when pursuing the fleeing Prince.

The population was 24,137 by 1841.

Armoury Towers was completed in 1858 and the Bridge Street drill hall was completed in 1871.

=== Industry ===
Macclesfield was once the world&#x27;s biggest producer of finished silk. A domestic button industry had been established in the town by the mid-16th century, although the first mention of silk buttons is not until 1649. In the mid-18th century, when metal buttons became fashionable, the silk-button industry transitioned to silk manufacture in mills. Macclesfield&#x27;s first silk mill was founded by Charles Roe in 1743 or 1744. The mills were initially powered by water, and later by steam. There were 71 silk mills operating in 1832, employing 10,000 people, but a crash occurred in 1851 and many mill-workers emigrated to the American silk town of Paterson, New Jersey. The silk industry remained active in the town in the 1980s, but no longer dominated. Paradise Mill reopened in 1984 as a working mill museum, demonstrating the art of silk throwing and Jacquard weaving. The four Macclesfield Museums display a range of information and products from that period.

A short-lived copper-smelting operation was established by Roe in 1750, processing ore from mines at Alderley Edge and Ecton (Staffordshire), and later from Anglesey. The business switched to copper processing and the manufacture of brass in 1767, before closing after Roe&#x27;s death in 1781. The industry is reflected in some of the town&#x27;s street names.

Between 1826 and 1831 the Macclesfield Canal was constructed, linking Macclesfield to Marple to the north and Kidsgrove to the south. The canal was surveyed for its Act of Parliament by the canal and roads engineer Thomas Telford, and built by William Crosley (junior), the Macclesfield Canal Company&#x27;s engineer. It was the last narrow canal to be completed and had only limited success because within ten years much of the coal and other potential cargo was increasingly being transported by rail.
Macclesfield is the original home of Hovis breadmakers, produced in Publicity Works Mill (commonly referred to as &quot;the Hovis Mill&quot;) on the canal close to Buxton Road. It was founded by a Macclesfield businessman and a baker from Stoke-on-Trent. &quot;Hovis&quot; is said to derive from the Latin &quot;homo-vitalis&quot; (strength for man) as a way of providing a cheap and nutritious food for poor mill workers and was a very dry and dense wholemeal loaf completely different from the modern version.

Waters Green was once home to a nationally known horse market which features in the legend of the Wizard of Alderley Edge.
Waters Green and an area opposite Arighi Bianchi, now hidden under the Silk Road, also held a sheep and cattle market until the 1980s.

Macclesfield is said to be the only mill town to have escaped bombing in World War II. After the war, two pharmaceutical companies opened facilities in Macclesfield, Geigy (now part of Novartis) and the pharmaceutical division of ICI (now AstraZeneca).

== Governance ==

There are two tiers of local government covering Macclesfield, at civil parish (town) and unitary authority level: Macclesfield Town Council and Cheshire East Council. The town council is based at the Town Hall on Market Place, and Cheshire East Council also uses the building as an area office.

For national elections, the town forms part of the Macclesfield constituency, which has been represented by Tim Roca of Labour since the 2024 general election.

=== Administrative history ===
Macclesfield was historically a township in the ancient parish of Prestbury. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the Poor Laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Prestbury, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Macclesfield became a civil parish.

Macclesfield was also a chapelry from at least the 13th century, when St Michael&#x27;s Church (originally dedicated to All Saints) was built as a chapel of ease to St Peter&#x27;s Church, Prestbury. St Michael&#x27;s formally became a parish church in 1835, when Macclesfield was made a separate ecclesiastical parish from Prestbury.

The Macclesfield township was administered as a borough from at least the time of its 1261 charter. The borough was administered from a guildhall in the Market Place from at least the 13th century. Macclesfield Town Hall was completed in 1824 on the site of the guildhall.

A Macclesfield constituency was created in 1832, covering the borough plus adjoining parts of the townships of Hurdsfield and Sutton, where the urban area had grown beyond the borough boundaries. The borough was reformed in 1836 to become a municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. As part of the 1836 reforms, the borough was enlarged to match the constituency.

The result of the 1880 general election for the Macclesfield constituency was declared void due to corruption, and no by-election was allowed to be held. In 1885, the constituency was replaced by a much larger county constituency, also called Macclesfield, which took in surrounding towns and villages as well as the borough of Macclesfield.
The municipal borough of Macclesfield was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A much larger non-metropolitan borough of Macclesfield was created instead, which also covered an extensive surrounding area, including the towns of Bollington, Knutsford, and Wilmslow.

In 2009, Cheshire East Council was created, taking over the functions of the borough council and Cheshire County Council, which were both abolished. The area of the pre-1974 municipal borough of Macclesfield had been unparished since the 1974 reforms; a new civil parish of Macclesfield was created covering the area in 2015, with its parish council adopting the name Macclesfield Town Council.

== Geography ==

Macclesfield is in the east of Cheshire and on the River Bollin, a tributary of the River Mersey. It is close to the county borders of Greater Manchester to the north, Derbyshire to the east and Staffordshire to the south. It is near the towns of Stockport to the north, Buxton to the east and Congleton to the south. It is 38 miles (60 km) to the east of Chester, the county town of Cheshire.

To the west of the town lies the Cheshire Plain; Macclesfield Forest is to the east, containing Ridgegate and Trentabank Reservoirs which supply the town&#x27;s drinking water, as well as Tegg&#x27;s Nose and the Peak District.

=== Climate ===
Like most of the United Kingdom, Macclesfield has a temperate maritime climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). Records of the climate extend back to at least 1850. Between 1881 and 2005, the highest temperature has been on 3 August 1990 and the lowest, from at least 1850–2005, on 25 December 1860.

==Landmarks==

The town is famous for its once thriving silk industry, commemorated in the Silk Museum. 

The Georgian Town Hall was designed by Francis Goodwin in 1823. 

Macclesfield is home to an Augustus Pugin church, St Alban&#x27;s on Chester Road.

The former Cheshire County Asylum on Pavilion Way was designed by Robert Griffiths in Italianate style. It is now converted into apartments.

== Economy ==

Macclesfield is the manufacturing home to AstraZeneca, one of the world&#x27;s largest pharmaceutical companies. The furniture store Arighi Bianchi was founded in 1829. Other industries include textiles, light engineering, paper and plastics.

== Transport ==
=== Railway ===
Macclesfield station is on the Stafford to Manchester branch of the West Coast Main Line. It is served by three train operating companies:
* Avanti West Coast operates generally hourly inter-city services between Manchester Piccadilly (20 minutes away), (10 minutes), Stoke-on-Trent (15 minutes) and London Euston (1 hour 47 minutes)
* CrossCountry operates hourly inter-city services between Manchester Piccadilly, Stockport, , , and 
* Northern Trains provides an hourly stopping service between Manchester Piccadilly, Stockport, and Stoke-on-Trent.

A railway station was first opened at Beech Lane by the LNWR on 19 June 1849, which was replaced a month later by Hibel Road station. The current station dates from the modernisation of the West Coast Main Line in the mid-1960s, when the old station buildings were replaced.

=== Buses ===
Macclesfield has a bus station located within the town centre. The original building opened on Sunderland Street, just outside the railway station; it was replaced in 2004, when a new bus station opened on Queen Victoria Street.

The principal operators around Macclesfield are two subsidiaries of Centrebus Group: D&amp;G Bus and High Peak Buses. Fifteen bus routes run within the town and to other locations including Altrincham, 
Buxton, Congleton, Crewe, Knutsford, Stockport, Wilmslow and Wythenshawe. Only two services run on Sundays: route 58 to Chatsworth House and route 130 to Handforth Dean.

=== Roads ===
Macclesfield is served by good road links from the north, south and west, but has fewer roads going east due to the terrain of the Peak District. From the south, access from Congleton and the Potteries is from the A536, and via the A523 from Leek. From the north, the main access to the town is the A523 from Manchester, Hazel Grove and Poynton. The main west–east road is the A537 Knutsford to Buxton road. At various points around the town centre, some of these roads combine, such as the A537 / A523 on the Silk Road section, giving rise to traffic congestion, especially at peak times. The A538 provides access to Prestbury, Wilmslow and Manchester Airport, with the B5470 being the only other eastbound route from the town, heading to Whaley Bridge and Chapel-en-le-Frith.

== Culture ==
Macclesfield has been accused of having few cultural amenities. In 2004, research was published in &quot;The Times&quot; naming Macclesfield and its borough the most uncultured town in Britain, based on its lack of theatres, cinemas and other cultural facilities.

The Northern Chamber Orchestra is the oldest professional chamber ensemble in the North West; its home is the Macclesfield Heritage Centre and presents a series of eight concerts a year, attracting international guest soloists. The Silk Opera Company was created to perform &#x27;The Monkey Run&#x27; at Barnaby.

After recent rationalisation, the town now has one museum: the Silk Museum, on Park Lane, which includes paid access to Paradise Mill, a former silk mill. The Silk Museum houses the Ancient Egyptian artefacts brought back by Victorian antiquarian Marianne Brocklehurst and her partner Mary Booth: these were formerly held in West Park Museum, as well as a number of art galleries.

Macclesfield Chess Club is one of the oldest chess clubs in the country, having been founded in 1886.

The &#x27;Macclesfield Literary and Philosophical Society&#x27; was formed in 2006, partly in response to &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27; 2004 article.

Local newspapers include the &quot;Macclesfield Express&quot; and the &quot;Community News&quot;. Macclesfield residents have access to Macclesfield Forum, an online Internet forum, for informal discussion of local news and issues. The town is also served by two locally based radio stations: Canalside Community Radio based at the Clarence Mill in Bollington, just north of Macclesfield, and Cheshire&#x27;s Silk Radio, an independent commercial radio station with studios in the town. Local information websites include &quot;Visit Macclesfield&quot; and the local what&#x27;s on guide, &quot;Canalside&#x27;s The Thread&quot;.

The last remaining commercial cinema in Macclesfield closed in 1997. Discussions have taken place regarding the possibility of building a multiplex cinema, but attempts to build a cinema have thus far been unsuccessful. In 2005, a small-scale cinema, Cinemac, was set up in the Heritage Centre, which has since become well established; also based in the Heritage Centre is the Silk Screen arts cinema, which gives fortnightly screenings of art-house films.

Amateur dramatics is well represented in the town; the Macclesfield Amateur Dramatic Society has existed since 1947 and performs in its own theatre on Lord Street. The Macclesfield Majestic Theatre Group has been producing musicals since its inception in 1971, initially at the Majestic Theatre (hence the title), but latterly at various other locations after the theatre was converted into a public house by the new tenants. Most recently, shows have been produced at the Heritage Centre, the Evans Theatre in Wilmslow and MADS Theatre on Lord Street. Several members of this society have progressed to the professional stage, most notably Marshall Lancaster and Jonathan Morris.

Gawsworth Old Hall hosts an annual Shakespeare festival as well as many arts and music events throughout the year.

Macclesfield has appeared in film; it was used as the location for Edward Dmytryk&#x27; film &quot;So Well Remembered&quot; in 1947, starring John Mills. Some of the locations are still recognisable, such as Hibel Road. A fictionalised version of Macclesfield&#x27;s railway station appeared in the 2005 football hooliganism film &quot;Green Street&quot;. It was also the location of &quot;Control&quot; (2007), a film about Ian Curtis, the lead vocalist of the rock band Joy Division.

The British blues singer John Mayall was born in the town in 1933. Macclesfield was also the home town of Ian Curtis and Stephen Morris of Joy Division, and Gillian Gilbert who, along with Morris, was a member of New Order. A memorial to Curtis is located at Macclesfield Crematorium. Other Macclesfield acts to have gained recognition include the Macc Lads and Marion. 

&quot;Silk Brass Band&quot;, the Macclesfield-based brass band, won the National Championship of Great Britain Third Section Final in 2002. Having been promoted from the third section in 2002, they have since consistently competed in the Second, First and Championship sections of the UK&#x27;s brass band grading system. Local band the Virginmarys has achieved national and international success.

In literature, Macclesfield is the second principal location of the fantasy novels &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Moon of Gomrath&quot; (1963) by Alan Garner.

In 2008, the borough was named as the fifth happiest of 273 districts in Britain by researchers from the universities of Sheffield and Manchester, who used information on self-reported personal well-being from the British Household Panel Survey.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter situated south east of the town.

The town is served by both BBC Radio Manchester and BBC Radio Stoke. Other radio stations are Heart North West, Smooth North West, Capital Manchester and Lancashire and Greatest Hits Radio Manchester &amp; The North West. Community based stations that broadcast from the town are Silk Radio and Canalside Radio. 

&quot;Macclesfield Express&quot; is the town&#x27;s local newspaper which publishes on Wednesdays. 

== Education ==
Macclesfield is served by four state-funded academies (previously state high schools); Tytherington School, The Macclesfield Academy, Fallibroome Academy and All Hallows Catholic College.

There is also an independent school, Beech Hall School.

Macclesfield Academy is made up of pupils from the former school Henbury High School, and also took in the pupils left over when Ryles Park secondary school closed in 2004. Ryles Park had been in turn an amalgamation of Ryles Park girls school and the oldest state school in the town, Macclesfield Central boys school, which closed in 1975. It is on the site of Macclesfield College and Park Lane Special School as part of the Macclesfield &#x27;Learning Zone&#x27;, which was opened in 2007. Macclesfield High School was the name originally given to the girls grammar school on Fence Avenue which formed part of the King&#x27;s School.

== Religion ==
The hilltop church of St Michael and All Angels has views of nearby Kerridge Hill. The church is approached from Waters Green by a flight of 108 steps, which themselves are a local landmark.
Macclesfield Sunday School started in 1796 as a non-denominational Sunday School in Pickford Street, which catered for 40 children. It was founded by John Whitaker whose objective was &quot;to lessen the sum of human wretchedness by diffusing religious knowledge and useful learning among the lower classes of society&quot;. Though chapels set up their denominational schools, the Sunday School committee in 1812 elected to erect a purpose-built school on Roe Street. The Big Sunday School had 1,127 boys and 1,324 girls on its books when it opened.

St Alban&#x27;s Church in Chester Road is an active Roman Catholic parish church. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It was designed by A. W. N. Pugin.

Christ Church is a brick-built redundant Anglican church, located on Great King Street. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church was in use until 1981. It remains consecrated and is used occasionally for services.

An Ebenezer Chapel was established on Rainow Road in 1864. It is now a private residence. 

There is a Mormon church located on Victoria Road.

== Sport and leisure ==
=== Football ===

Macclesfield&#x27;s professional football club, Macclesfield Town, first gained league status in 1997 as Football Conference Champions; they had won that title two years earlier but were denied promotion as their Moss Rose stadium in the south of the town failed to meet Football League stadium capacity requirements. At the end of the 2019–20 season, the Silkmen were relegated from EFL League Two. In September 2020, Macclesfield Town Football Club was wound up in the High Court over debts totalling more than £500,000.

<text>Earlsdon is a residential suburb and electoral ward of Coventry, England. It lies approximately one mile to the southwest of Coventry City Centre. It is the birthplace of aviation pioneer Frank Whittle.

==Amenities==
Most shops and restaurants are laid out on Earlsdon Street, the suburban high street. Earlsdon Library is one of the largest of the local-authority libraries outside of the city centre.

In major sports, Earlsdon has its own rugby, golf and tennis clubs. Recreation grounds for football also are in Earlsdon.

==History==

In the mid-19th century, Earlsdon was a hub of activity for the rising watch-making trade. Even as the industry began to decline, Earlsdon continued to grow and was incorporated into the city of Coventry in 1890. The watch-making trade is represented by the clock on the roundabout at the bottom of the high street, where Earlsdon Avenue North and South join.

In 1897, the opening of Albany Road, named after Princess Helena, Duchess of Albany, who visited Coventry in November the following year, allowed for far greater access to and from the rest of the city and development in Earlsdon quickly increased. By 1918, the area was fully developed as it is today, but has seen some redevelopment in recent years.

Today, Earlsdon is a large residential suburb associated with Wainsbody ward to the south. Many academics and students from Coventry University and the University of Warwick live in both wards as they are closest to Coventry University and have streets of upmarket Edwardian homes for industry owners and, increasingly, on the expansion of higher education centres, researchers and lecturers.

In August 2006 following a torrential downpour of rain, the main street of Earlsdon suffered from serious flooding. Many businesses were affected, and some were forced to close for a time.
==Places of interest==

The hub of Earlsdon is what is locally referred to as the &quot;Earlsdon High Street&quot;, in reality Earlsdon Street. This is a strip of commercial units that includes a number of restaurants and pubs. The area surrounding Earlsdon Street consists of rows of terraced houses and a few small shops. In the south of the locality is the large civic landscaped War Memorial Park, the north abuts Hearsall Common, and Canley Ford abuts the west.

==Frank Whittle==
Sir Frank Whittle (1907–96), the jet engine pioneer, was born in Earlsdon in a terraced house on Newcombe Road, which is marked out by a small grey commemorative plaque. He attended a school in Earlsdon, and he was inspired to pursue a career in engineering after allegedly seeing an aircraft land on Hearsall Common. At the age of nine he moved to Leamington Spa with his family when his father started an engineering factory there.

==Arts and culture==
Earlsdon has its own theatre, the Criterion Theatre, that puts on six main house performances a year, as well as numerous visiting companies and workshop productions. ECHO (Earlsdon, Chapelfields Hearsall Opinion) is the longest running independent community newspaper in the country (http://www.echonews.org.uk). There is an annual &quot;Earlsdon Festival&quot;, that takes place in Earlsdon Street and other locations nearby during the May Day bank holiday. The annual Godiva Festival takes place within the War Memorial Park usually during one week-end in July.

==Demography==
==Politics==
Earlsdon has long covered Canley Gardens but also covers Styvechale as well as the westernmost mainstay marked as Earlsdon on most maps.

As of December 2009 the ward is represented by 3 local councillors who sit on Coventry City Council: Allan Andrews (C), Becky Gittins (Lab) and Kindy Sandhu (Lab).

Parts of Earlsdon also fall under Whoberley Ward and St Michael&#x27;s Ward.

<doc id="244149" wikidata="Q696192" url="?curid=244149" title="Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere">
<text>The , also known as the GEACPS, was a pan-Asian union that the Empire of Japan tried to establish. Initially, it covered Japan (including annexed Korea), Manchukuo, and China, but as the Pacific War progressed, it also included territories in Southeast Asia and parts of India. The term was first coined by Minister for Foreign Affairs Hachirō Arita on June 29, 1940.

The proposed objectives of this union were to ensure economic self-sufficiency and cooperation among the member states, along with resisting the influence of Western imperialism and Soviet communism. In reality, militarists and nationalists saw it as an effective propaganda tool to enforce Japanese hegemony. The latter approach was reflected in a document released by Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Health and Welfare, &quot;An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus&quot;, which promoted racial supremacist theories. Japanese spokesmen openly described the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as a device for the &quot;development of the Japanese race.&quot; When World War II ended, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere became a source of criticism and scorn for Allies.

==Development of the concept==
The concept of a unified Asia under Japanese leadership had its roots dating back to the 16th century. For example, Toyotomi Hideyoshi proposed to make China, Korea, and Japan into &quot;one&quot;. Moreover, Hideyoshi had further plans to expand into India, the Philippines, and other islands in the Pacific. Modern conceptions emerged in 1917. During the proceedings of the Lansing-Ishii Agreement, Japan explained to Western observers that their expansionism in Asia was analogous to the United States&#x27; Monroe Doctrine. This conception was influential in the development of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity concept, with the Japanese Army also comparing it to the Roosevelt Corollary. One of the reasons why Japan adopted imperialism was to resolve domestic issues such as overpopulation and resource scarcity. Another reason was to withstand Western imperialism.

On November 3, 1938, Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe and Minister for Foreign Affairs Hachirō Arita proposed the development of the , which was limited to Japan, China, and the puppet state of Manchukuo. They believed that the union had 6 purposes:

# Permanent stability of Eastern Asia
# Neighbourly amity and international justice
# Joint defence against communism
# Creation of a new culture
# Economic cohesion and co-operation
# World peace

The vagueness of the above points were effective in making people more agreeable to militarism and collaborationism.

On June 29, 1940, Arita renamed the union the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which he announced by radio address. At Yōsuke Matsuoka&#x27;s advice, Arita emphasised on the economic aspects more. On August 1, Konoe, who still used the original name, expanded the scope of the union to include the territories of Southeast Asia. On November 5, Konoe reaffirmed that a Japan–Manchukuo–China yen bloc would continue and be &quot;perfected&quot;.

==History==

The outbreak of World War II in Europe gave the Japanese an opportunity to fulfill the objectives of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, without significant pushback from the Western powers or China. This entailed the conquest of Southeast Asian territories to extract their natural resources. If territories were unprofitable, the Japanese would encourage their subjects, including those in mainland Japan, to endure &quot;economic suffering&quot; and prevent outflow of material to the enemy. Nonetheless, they preached the moral superiority of cultivating a &quot;spiritual essence&quot; instead of prioritising material gain like Western powers.

After Japanese advancements into French Indochina in 1940, knowing that Japan was completely dependent on other countries for natural resources, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered a trade embargo on steel and oil, raw materials that were vital to Japan&#x27;s war effort. Without steel and oil imports, Japan&#x27;s military could not fight for long. As a result of the embargo, Japan decided to attack the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia from 7 to 19 December 1941, seizing the raw materials needed for the war effort. These efforts were successful, with Japanese politician Nobusuke Kishi announcing via radio broadcast that vast resources were available for Japanese use in the newly conquered territories.

As part of its war drive in the Pacific, Japanese propaganda included phrases like &quot;Asia for the Asiatics&quot; and talked about the need to &quot;liberate&quot; Asian colonies from the control of Western powers. They also planned to change the Chinese hegemony in the agricultural market in Southeast Asia with Japanese immigrants to boost its economic value, with the former being despised by Southeast Asian natives. The Japanese failure to bring the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War to a swift conclusion was blamed in part on the lack of resources; Japanese propaganda claimed this was due to the refusal by Western powers to supply Japan&#x27;s military. Although invading Japanese forces sometimes received rapturous welcomes throughout recently captured Asian territories due to anti-Western and occasionally, anti-Chinese sentiment, the subsequent brutality of the Japanese military led many of the inhabitants of those regions to regard Japan as being worse than their former colonial rulers. The Japanese government directed that economies of occupied territories be managed strictly for the production of raw materials for the Japanese war effort; a cabinet member declared, &quot;There are no restrictions. They are enemy possessions. We can take them, do anything we want&quot;. For example, according to estimates, under Japanese occupation, about 100,000 Burmese and Malay Indian labourers died while constructing the Burma-Siam Railway. The Japanese sometimes spared ethnic groups, such as Chinese immigrants, if they supported the war effort, whether sincerely or not.

&quot;An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus&quot; – a secret document completed in 1943 for high-ranking government use – laid out that Japan, as the originator and strongest military power within the region, would naturally take the superior position within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, with the other nations under Japan&#x27;s umbrella of protection. Japanese propaganda was useful in mobilizing Japanese citizens for the war effort, convincing them Japan&#x27;s expansion was an act of anti-colonial liberation from Western domination. The booklet &quot;Read This and the War is Won&quot;—for the Japanese Army—presented colonialism as an oppressive group of colonists living in luxury by burdening Asians. According to Japan, since racial ties of blood connected other Asians to the Japanese, and Asians had been weakened by colonialism, it was Japan&#x27;s self-appointed role to &quot;make men of them again&quot; and liberate them from their Western oppressors.

According to Foreign Minister Shigenori Tōgō (in office 1941–1942 and 1945), should Japan be successful in creating this sphere, it would emerge as the leader of Eastern Asia, and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere would be synonymous with the Japanese Empire.

===Greater East Asia Conference===


The took place in Tokyo on 5–6 November 1943: Japan hosted the heads of state of various component members of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The conference was also referred to as the &quot;Tokyo Conference&quot;. The common language used by the delegates during the conference was English. The conference was mainly used as propaganda.

At the conference, Tojo greeted them with a speech praising the &quot;spiritual essence&quot; of Asia instead of the &quot;materialistic civilisation&quot; of the West. Their meeting was characterised by the praise of solidarity and condemnation of Western colonialism but without practical plans for either economic development or integration. Because of a lack of military representatives at the conference, the conference served little military value.

With the simultaneous use of Wilsonian and Pan-Asian rhetoric, the goals of the conference were to solidify the commitment of certain Asian countries to Japan&#x27;s war effort and to improve Japan&#x27;s world image; however, the representatives of the other attending countries were in practice neither independent nor treated as equals by Japan.

The following dignitaries attended:
* Hideki Tojo, Prime Minister of the Empire of Japan
* Zhang Jinghui, Prime Minister of the Empire of Manchuria
* Wang Jingwei, President of the Republic of China
* Ba Maw, Head of State of the State of Burma
* Subhas Chandra Bose, Head of State of the Provisional Government of Free India
* José P. Laurel, President of the Republic of the Philippines
* Prince Wan Waithayakon, envoy from the Kingdom of Thailand

===Imperial rule===
The ideology of the Japanese colonial empire, as it expanded dramatically during the war, contained two contradictory impulses. On the one hand, it preached the unity of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, a coalition of Asian races directed by Japan against Western imperialism in Asia. This approach celebrated the spiritual values of the East in opposition to the &quot;crass materialism&quot; of the West. In practice, however, the Japanese installed organisationally-minded bureaucrats and engineers to run their new empire, and they believed in ideals of efficiency, modernisation, and engineering solutions to social problems. Japanese was the official language of the bureaucracy in all of the areas and was taught at schools as a national language.

Japan set up puppet regimes in Manchuria and China; they vanished at the war&#x27;s end. The Imperial Army operated ruthless administrations in most conquered areas but paid more favourable attention to the Dutch East Indies. The main goal was to obtain oil but the Dutch colonial government destroyed the oil wells. However, the Japanese could repair and reopen them within a few months of their conquest. However, most tankers transporting oil to Japan were sunk by U.S. Navy submarines, so Japan&#x27;s oil shortage became increasingly acute. Japan also sponsored an Indonesian nationalist movement under Sukarno. Sukarno finally came to power in the late 1940s after several years of fighting the Dutch.

===Philippines===
To build up the economic base of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Japanese Army envisioned using the Philippine islands as a source of agricultural products needed by its industry. For example, Japan had a surplus of sugar from Taiwan, and a severe shortage of cotton, so they tried to grow cotton on sugar lands with disastrous results; they lacked the seeds, pesticides, and technical skills to grow cotton. Jobless farm workers flocked to the cities, where there was minimal relief and few jobs. The Japanese Army also tried using cane sugar for fuel, castor beans and copra for oil, &quot;Derris&quot; for quinine, cotton for uniforms, and abacá for rope. The plans were difficult to implement due to limited skills, collapsed international markets, bad weather, and transportation shortages. The program failed, giving very little help to Japanese industry and diverting resources needed for food production. As Stanley Karnow writes, Filipinos &quot;rapidly learned as well that &#x27;co-prosperity&#x27; meant servitude to Japan&#x27;s economic requirements&quot;.

Living conditions were poor throughout the Philippines during the war. Transportation between the islands was difficult because of a lack of fuel. Food was in short supply, with sporadic famines and epidemic diseases that killed hundreds of thousands of people. In October 1943, Japan declared the Philippines an independent republic. The Japanese-sponsored Second Philippine Republic, headed by President José P. Laurel, proved to be ineffective and unpopular as Japan maintained very tight control.

===Failure===
The Co-Prosperity Sphere collapsed with Japan&#x27;s surrender to the Allies in September 1945. Ba Maw, wartime President of Burma under the Japanese, blamed the Japanese military for the failure of the Co-Prosperity Sphere:

In other words, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere operated not for the betterment of all the Asian countries but for Japan&#x27;s interests, and thus the Japanese failed to gather support in other Asian countries. Nationalist movements did appear in these Asian countries during this period, and these nationalists cooperated with the Japanese to some extent. However, Willard Elsbree, professor emeritus of political science at Ohio University, claims that the Japanese government and these nationalist leaders never developed &quot;a real unity of interests between the two parties, [and] there was no overwhelming despair on the part of the Asians at Japan&#x27;s defeat&quot;.

The failure of Japan to understand the goals and interests of the other countries involved in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere led to a weak association of countries bound to Japan only in theory and not in spirit. Ba Maw argued that Japan should&#x27;ve acted according to the declared aims of &quot;Asia for the Asiatics&quot;. He claimed that if Japan had proclaimed this maxim at the beginning of the war and acted on that idea, they could have engineered a very different outcome.

==Propaganda efforts==
Pamphlets were dropped by airplane on the Philippines, Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak, Singapore, and Indonesia, urging them to join the movement. Mutual cultural societies were founded in all conquered lands to ingratiate with the natives and try to supplant English with Japanese as the commonly used language. Multi-lingual pamphlets depicted many Asians marching or working together in happy unity, with the flags of all the states and a map depicting the intended sphere. Others proclaimed that they had given independent governments to the countries they occupied, a claim undermined by the lack of power given to these puppet governments.

In Thailand, a street was built to demonstrate it, to be filled with modern buildings and shops, but of it consisted of false fronts. A network of Japanese-sponsored film production, distribution, and exhibition companies extended across the Japanese Empire and was collectively referred to as the Greater East Asian Film Sphere. These film centers mass-produced shorts, newsreels, and feature films to encourage Japanese language acquisition as well as cooperation with Japanese colonial authorities.

==Projected territorial extent==

Prior to the escalation of World War II to the Pacific and East Asia, Japanese planners regarded it as self-evident that the conquests secured in Japan&#x27;s earlier wars with Russia (South Sakhalin and Kwantung), Germany (South Seas Mandate), and China (Manchuria) would be retained, as well as Korea (&quot;Chōsen&quot;), Taiwan (&quot;Formosa&quot;), the recently seized additional portions of China, and occupied French Indochina.

===Land Disposal Plan===
A reasonably accurate indication as to the geographic dimensions of the Co-Prosperity Sphere are elaborated on in a Japanese wartime document prepared in December 1941 by the Research Department of the Ministry of War. Known as the &quot;Land Disposal Plan in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere&quot; () it was put together with the consent of and according to the directions of the Minister of War (later Prime Minister) Hideki Tōjō. It assumed that the already established puppet governments of Manchukuo, Mengjiang, and the Wang Jingwei regime in Japanese-occupied China would continue to function in these areas. Beyond these contemporary parts of Japan&#x27;s sphere of influence it also envisaged the conquest of a vast range of territories covering virtually all of East Asia, the Pacific Ocean, and even sizable portions of the Western Hemisphere, including in locations as far removed from Japan as South America and the eastern Caribbean.

Although the projected extension of the Co-Prosperity Sphere was extremely ambitious, the Japanese goal during the &quot;Greater East Asia War&quot; was not to acquire all the territory designated in the plan at once, but to prepare for a future decisive war some 20 years later by conquering the Asian colonies of the defeated European powers, as well as the Philippines from the United States. When Tōjō spoke on the plan to the House of Peers he was vague about the long-term prospects, but insinuated that the Philippines and Burma might be allowed independence, although vital territories such as Hong Kong would remain under Japanese rule.

The Micronesian islands that had been seized from Germany in World War I and which were assigned to Japan as C-Class Mandates, namely the Marianas, Carolines, Marshall Islands, and several others do not figure in this project. They were the subject of earlier negotiations with the Germans and were expected to be officially ceded to Japan in return for economic and monetary compensations.

The plan divided Japan&#x27;s future empire into two different groups. The first group of territories were expected to become either part of Japan or otherwise be under its direct administration. Second were those territories that would fall under the control of a number of tightly controlled pro-Japanese vassal states based on the model of Manchukuo, as nominally &quot;independent&quot; members of the Greater East Asian alliance.

Parts of the plan depended on successful negotiations with Nazi Germany and a global victory by the Axis powers. After Germany and Italy declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941, Japan presented the Germans with a drafted military convention that would specifically delimit the Asian continent by a dividing line along the 70th meridian east longitude. This line, running southwards through the Ob River&#x27;s Arctic estuary, southwards to just east of Khost in Afghanistan and heading into the Indian Ocean just west of Rajkot in India, would have split Germany&#x27;s &quot;Lebensraum&quot; and Italy&#x27;s &quot;spazio vitale&quot; territories to the west of it, and Japan&#x27;s Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and its other areas to the east of it. The plan of the Third Reich for fortifying its own &quot;Lebensraum&quot; territory&#x27;s eastern limits, beyond which the Co-Prosperity Sphere&#x27;s northwestern frontier areas would exist in East Asia, involved the creation of a &quot;living wall&quot; of &quot;Wehrbauer&quot; &quot;soldier-peasant&quot; communities defending it. However, it is unknown if the Axis powers ever formally negotiated a possible, complementary &quot;second&quot; demarcation line that would have divided the Western Hemisphere.

====Japanese-governed====
* &quot;Government-General of Formosa&quot;
:Hong Kong, the Philippines, Portuguese Macau (to be purchased from Portugal or taken by force), the Paracel Islands, and Hainan Island (to be purchased from the Chinese puppet regime). Contrary to its name it was not intended to include the island of Formosa (Taiwan)
* &quot;South Seas Government Office&quot;
:Guam, Nauru, Ocean Island, the Gilbert Islands, and Wake Island
* &quot;Melanesian Region Government-General&quot; or &quot;South Pacific Government-General&quot;
:British New Guinea, Australian New Guinea, the Admiralties, New Britain, New Ireland, the Solomon Islands, the Santa Cruz Archipelago, the Ellice Islands, the Fiji Islands, the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, the Loyalty Islands, and the Chesterfield Islands
* &quot;Eastern Pacific Government-General&quot;
:Hawaii Territory, Howland Island, Baker Island, the Phoenix Islands, the Marquesas and Tuamotu Islands, the Society Islands, the Cook and Austral Islands, all of the Samoan Islands, and Tonga. The possibility of re-establishing the defunct Kingdom of Hawaii was also considered, based on the model of Manchukuo. Those favouring annexation of Hawaii (on the model of Karafuto) intended to use the local Japanese community, which had constituted 43% (c. 160,000) of Hawaii&#x27;s population in the 1920s, as a leverage. Hawaii was to become self-sufficient in food production, while the Big Five corporations of sugar and pineapple processing were to be broken up. No decision was ever reached regarding whether Hawaii would be annexed to Japan, become a puppet state, or be used as a bargaining chip for leverage against the U.S.
* &quot;Australian Government-General&quot;
:All of Australia including Tasmania. Australia and New Zealand were to accommodate up to two million Japanese settlers. However, there are indications that the Japanese were also looking for a separate peace with Australia, and a satellite state rather than colony status similar to that of Burma and the Philippines.
* &quot;New Zealand Government-General&quot;
:The New Zealand North and South Islands, Macquarie Island, as well as the rest of the Southwest Pacific
* &quot;Ceylon Government-General&quot;
:Ceylon and all of India below a line running approximately from Portuguese Goa to the coastline of the Bay of Bengal
* &quot;Alaska Government-General&quot;
:The Alaska Territory, the Yukon Territory, the western portion of the Northwest Territories, Alberta, British Columbia, and Washington. There were also plans to make the American West Coast (comprising California and Oregon) a semi-autonomous satellite state. This latter plan was not seriously considered as it depended upon a global victory of Axis forces.
* &quot;Government-General of Central America&quot;
:Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, British Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, the Maracaibo (western) portion of Venezuela, Ecuador, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and The Bahamas. In addition, if either Mexico, Peru, or Chile were to enter the war against Japan, substantial parts of these states would also be ceded to Japan. Events that transpired between May 22, 1942, when Mexico declared war on the Axis, through Peru&#x27;s declaration of war on February 12, 1944, and concluding with Chile only declaring war on Japan by April 11, 1945 (as Nazi Germany was nearly defeated at that time), brought all three of these southeast Pacific Rim nations of the Western Hemisphere&#x27;s Pacific coast into conflict with Japan by the war&#x27;s end. The future of Trinidad, British and Dutch Guiana, and the British and French possessions in the Leeward Islands at the hands of Imperial Japan were meant to be left open for negotiations with Nazi Germany had the Axis forces been victorious.

====Asian puppet states====
* &quot;East Indies Kingdom&quot;
:Dutch East Indies, British Borneo, Christmas Islands, Cocos Islands, Andaman, Nicobar Islands, and Portuguese Timor (to be purchased from Portugal)
* &quot;Kingdom of Burma&quot;
:Burma proper, Assam (a province of the British Raj), and a large part of Bengal.
* &quot;Kingdom of Malaya&quot;
:Remainder of the Malay states
* &quot;Kingdom of Annam&quot;
:Annam, Laos, and Tonkin
* &quot;Kingdom of Cambodia&quot;
:Cambodia and French Cochinchina

Puppet states which already existed at the time, the Land Disposal Plan has been drafted, were:
* &quot;Empire of Manchuria&quot;
:Chinese Manchuria
* &quot;Republic of China&quot;
:Other parts of China occupied by Japan
* &quot;Mengjiang&quot;
:Inner Mongolia territories west of Manchuria, since 1940 officially a part of the Republic of China. It was meant as a starting point for a regime which would cover all of Mongolia.

Contrary to the plan Japan installed a puppet state on the Philippines instead of exerting direct control. In the former French Indochina, the Empire of Vietnam, the Kingdom of Kampuchea, and the Kingdom of Luang Prabang were founded. Vietnam attempted to work for independence and made progressive reforms. The State of Burma did not become a kingdom.

<doc id="244150" wikidata="Q3499408" url="?curid=244150" title="Johann Pucher">
<text>Johann Augustin Pucher ( or &quot;Ivan Pucher&quot;; August 26, 1814 – August 7, 1864) was a Slovene priest, scientist, photographer, artist, and poet who invented an unusual process for making photographs on glass.

Although his were not the first glass photographs, Pucher&#x27;s process was unique. It was the only 19th-century photography technique that was not based on expensive silver halide chemistry but was still sensitive enough to use in a camera, with exposure times comparable to those of the daguerreotype and calotype. (Other non-silver processes, such as the cyanotype, were practical only for making prints or photograms in direct sunlight.) Modern testing of Pucher&#x27;s photographs has confirmed their chemically unusual nature. However, his process was never commercialized, and attempts to recreate it based on published information have been unsuccessful.

== Biography ==
Pucher was born on August 26, 1814 in Kranj in the Duchy of Carniola in the Austrian Empire (now Slovenia). He was the son of Joseph Pucher and Maria Lebar Pucher, and he was baptized &quot;Augustin Johann Pucher&quot;.

As a schoolchild, Pucher was interested in art, languages, and the natural sciences, especially chemistry and physics. He wanted to study art, but obeyed his mother&#x27;s wish and became a Catholic priest. However, he continued to experiment in photography, art, and music. When the French Academy of Sciences announced the invention of the daguerreotype on 19 August 1839, Pucher quickly mastered the process, but it was too expensive, so he developed his own way of making photographs. On April 19, 1842, he invented a photographic process on glass that he called the hyalotype, or &quot;svetlopis&quot; in Slovene. His photos are also called puharotypes, in his honor. The first report about his invention was published in the newspaper &quot;Carniolia&quot; in 1841.

While living in Bled, Pucher met a French viscount, Louis de Dax, who wrote about him in the Parisian magazine &quot;La Lumière&quot;. The church then moved Pucher to a small village, Cerklje, where his contacts abroad lessened. Ultimately, he became sick from the harmful substances used in his experiments and died at the age of 49.

== Hyalotype process ==

According to Pucher&#x27;s records of his photographic process, he coated a small glass plate with a layer of light-sensitive sulfur, exposed it to iodine vapors, and inserted the prepared plate into a camera. He then poured mercury into a metal container, placed the mercury at the bottom of the camera, and heated it from below. He exposed the prepared plate to light for 15 seconds, and mercury vapors coated the exposed places on the picture. Pucher strengthened the picture with bromine steam and fixed it by wrapping it with alcohol. Finally, he preserved the photo with varnish.

The advantages of Pucher&#x27;s procedure included a shorter exposure time (15 seconds, which allowed him to make portraits), a positive image, and the possibility of reproduction.

Pucher was not the first to try to create photos on glass: A Frenchman, Abel Niépce de Saint-Victor, reported his own invention to the French Academy of Sciences in 1847. It was not until January 1851 that the Austrian Academy of Sciences published a report on Pucher&#x27;s method.

<doc id="244152" wikidata="Q2601996" url="?curid=244152" title="Yusef Komunyakaa">
<text>Yusef Komunyakaa (born James William Brown; April 29, 1941) is an American poet who teaches at New York University and is a member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers. Komunyakaa is a recipient of the 1994 Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award, for &quot;Neon Vernacular&quot; and the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. He also received the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize. Komunyakaa received the 2007 Louisiana Writer Award for his contribution to poetry.

His subject matter ranges from the black experience through rural Southern life before the Civil Rights era and his experience as a soldier during the Vietnam War.

==Life and career==
According to public records, Komunyakaa was born in 1947 and given the name James William Brown. (His former wife said in her memoir that he was born in 1941.) He was the eldest of five children of James William Brown, a carpenter, and his wife. He grew up in the small town of Bogalusa, Louisiana. As an adult, he reclaimed the name &quot;Komunyakaa&quot;, said to be his grandfather&#x27;s African name. He said that his grandfather had reached the United States as a stowaway in a ship from Trinidad. 

Brown served in the US Army, serving one tour of duty in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. According to his former wife, Mandy Sayer, he was discharged on 14 December 1966. He worked as a specialist for the military paper, &quot;Southern Cross,&quot; covering actions and stories, interviewing fellow soldiers, and publishing articles on Vietnamese history, which earned him a Bronze Star. He has since used these experiences as the source of his war poetry collections &quot;Toys in a Field&quot; (1986) and &quot;Dien Cai Dau&quot; (1988), the title of which derives from a derogatory term in Vietnamese for American soldiers. Komunyakaa has said that following his return to the United States, he found the American people&#x27;s rejection of Vietnam veterans to be every bit as painful as the racism he had experienced while growing up in the American South before the Civil Rights Movement.

After his service, he attended college at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, where he was an editor for the campus arts and literature publication, &quot;riverrun&quot;, to which he also contributed. He began to write poetry in 1973 and took the name Yusef Komunyakaa. He earned his M.A. in Writing from Colorado State University in 1978, and an M.F.A. in creative writing from the University of California, Irvine, in 1980. After receiving his M.F.A., Komunyakaa began teaching poetry in the New Orleans public school system and creative writing at the University of New Orleans.

Komunyakaa taught at Indiana University Bloomington until the fall of 1997, when he became a professor in the Program in Creative Writing at Princeton University. Yusef Komunyakaa is a professor in the Creative Writing Program at New York University.

==Poetry==

Komunyakaa&#x27;s &quot;I Apologize for the Eyes in My Head&quot;, published in 1986, won the San Francisco Poetry Prize. More attention came with the publication of &quot;Dien Cai Dau&quot; (Vietnamese for &quot;crazy in the head&quot;), published in 1988, which focused on his experiences in Vietnam and won the Dark Room Poetry Prize. Included was the poem &quot;Facing It&quot;, in which the speaker of the poems visits the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C.:

:He&#x27;s lost his right arm
:inside the stone. In the black mirror
:a woman&#x27;s trying to erase names
:No, she&#x27;s brushing a boy&#x27;s hair.
::— from &quot;Facing It&quot;

Komunyakaa many other published collections of poetry, include &quot;Taboo: The Wishbone Trilogy, Part I&quot; (2004), &quot;Pleasure Dome: New and Collected Poems, 1975–1999&quot; (2001), &quot;Talking Dirty to the Gods&quot; (2000), &quot;Thieves of Paradise&quot; (1998), &quot;Neon Vernacular&quot; (1994), and &quot;Magic City&quot; (1992).

In 2004, Komunyakaa began a collaboration with dramaturge and theater producer Chad Gracia on a dramatic adaptation of &quot;The Epic of Gilgamesh.&quot; The play was published in October 2006 by Wesleyan University Press. In spring 2008, New York&#x27;s 92nd Street Y staged a one-night performance by director Robert Scanlon. In May 2013 it received a full production by the Constellation Theatre Company in Washington, D.C.
He views his own work as an indirectness, an &quot;insinuation&quot;:
:Poetry is a kind of distilled insinuation. It’s a way of expanding and talking around an idea or a question. Sometimes, more actually gets said through such a technique than a full frontal assault.

==Marriage and family==
Komunyakaa married Australian novelist Mandy Sayer in 1985. That year, he was hired as an associate professor at Indiana University Bloomington. He also held the Ruth Lilly Professorship for two years from 1989 to 1990. He and Sayer were married for ten years.

He later had a relationship with India-born poet Reetika Vazirani with whom he had a child. Vazirani died in a murder-suicide, killing their son Jehan and herself in 2003; he was two years old.

==Interviews==
Over the years, Komunyakaa has taken part in many interviews on his life and works. In a 2018 interview titled &quot;The Complexity of Being Human,&quot; Komunyakaa addresses the careful use of language and influences of some of his most famous works such as &quot;Facing It.&quot; He compares his work to that of a painter or carpenter. He states that poetry is vastly different from journalism in that his work is more violent, much like nature.

In his interview &quot;The Singing Underneath,&quot; Komunyakaa describes the biblical influences in his work. He recalls reading the Bible in his youth and discovering what he believed to be underlying poetic elements. Komunyakaa also pays his respects to early influences such as Langston Hughes, Paul Laurence Dunbar, and Phillis Wheatley.

In a 2010 interview by &quot;Tufts Observer&quot;, Komunyakaa when asked to list the individuals who most influenced him, he names Robert Hayden, Bishop, Pablo Neruda, and Walt Whitman.

Below are a few of his most popular interviews:
*&quot;Interview: Paul Muldoon &amp; Yusef Komunyakaa&quot;
