<text>Proxomitron, the Universal Web Filter, is a filtering web proxy written by Scott R. Lemmon. This program was originally designed to run under Windows 95. All future development of the program was ceased in 2003 one year before its author&#x27;s death on 1 May 2004. Proxomitron is still viable and used on later Windows platforms such as Vista and Windows 10.

==Premise==
The program is generally used to block pop-ups and banners, to remove embedded sounds and animation from web pages, to alter or block JavaScript, and to modify the appearance and content of web pages.

== Overview ==
Properly configured, Proxomitron intercepts HTTP traffic between the user&#x27;s browser and web servers. The program is capable of altering web page content by removing or adding text. Additionally, it can add, modify, or delete HTTP message headers, be configured to block connections or redirect requests based on the web page address, and be configured to route connections through a remote proxy. The user can monitor connections and filter activations, if desired.

Program operation is dictated through the use of a configuration file containing specialized filters which can be written, edited, deleted, enabled or disabled by the user via the program&#x27;s graphical user interface. (Third-party filters can also be imported, or &quot;merged&quot;, into the configuration.) The filters utilize a &quot;matching&quot; language similar to the standard regular expressions used in text editing. Additional files, such as &quot;blocklists&quot; and SSL DLLs, can extend filtering capabilities.

Use of the program requires knowledge of the Proxomitron scripting language, and some familiarity with at least one of HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The scripting interface was not designed to be user-friendly. Because of these complications, the program can be difficult to customize for novice or non-technical users. A default set of filters is included with the program; advanced filters and filter sets written by experienced users are also available online. (See external links.)

== Features ==
The following items are the basic applications and features of the program:
; Filter page content
: Using the scripting language, filters are prepared with editing commands to match and replace text in the downloaded page. Specific pages can be targeted for filtering by matching the page&#x27;s URL with a specified pattern.
; Filter HTTP headers
: Separate filters for incoming and outgoing HTTP headers can be used to modify the values of existing headers, add new headers, or delete headers. One example of such usage would be for cookie management.
; Variables
: Filters can use local variables (per filter) or global variables (available to all filters per request) to capture/store text for further test matching, to reinsert content into a new location, or to write content to lists. Preset variables are also available, e.g., the page&#x27;s URL.
; Special commands
: A number of special commands are available for use by filters or in URLs; e.g., a filter-based command can check if the user presses a particular key, or a URL-embedded command can direct Proxomitron to filter a local file.
; Create lists for filters
: Text files (known as &quot;blocklists&quot;) can be used as sources for patterns for filter matches.
; Create standard lists
: Text files (known as &quot;logfiles&quot;) can be used by filters to append captured data to a list.
; Create session lists
: Memory-only text files can be generated and used by filters to build temporary blocklists, or permanent blocklists can be configured to only allow filters to add memory-only &quot;session&quot; data.
; Insert files
: Local text files containing plain text, HTML snippits, css, or scripts can be independently retrieved and written into the web page by filters.
; Reroute traffic
: Filters can redirect requests to different web pages or to local files, either by sending the new location as a directive to the browser or by &quot;transparently&quot; connecting to the new location directly.
; View traffic between server and browser
: The log window permits the user to see the HTTP traffic between the browser and server. This can (optionally) include any POSTed data.
; Provide alerts
: Filters can be configured to have Proxomitron generate its own alert or confirmation popup containing user-supplied text.
; Uncompress data on the fly
: With the ZLIB library, the Proxomitron can uncompress GZIP compressed data streams and filter pages delivered in compressed modes.
; Filter &quot;secure&quot; channels
: With libraries to provide the SSL routines, the Proxomitron can filter secure, encoded streams. Since this forces the proxy to act as a &quot;man in the middle&quot;, this should not be used in most cases.
; Chain to remote proxies
: Proxomitron can test remote proxies, maintain a list of proxies to utilize, and be configured to rotate the remote proxy connections.
; Run program or URL
: Proxomitron can be configured to launch an external program or URL (as specified in the program settings) upon startup, or on demand via the Launch icon or a menu option. Launching programs and URLs from filters can also be accomplished through the use of an undocumented $EXEC command.
; Change interface textures
: The user can select bitmap images (referred to as &quot;textures&quot;) for tiling interface backgrounds and button and tab faces, or simply disable this feature. An internal set of default bitmaps (admittedly &quot;psychedelic&quot;) are included with the program.
; Debug
: A special viewing of the page source showing which filters matched what page content can be sent to the browser for debugging purposes. A test window is also available from the filter editor dialogs for testing matches and checking filter efficiency.

==License==
The program was distributed under a &quot;ShonenWare&quot; license. Under the license it was free to use. Lemmon would consider users purchasing and listening to a Shonen Knife CD would be sufficient to register that user.

== History ==
The first public release of Proxomitron (Naoko 2) was in 1999 as a download via Simtel. 
Releases that followed were all named &quot;Naoko&quot; (for Naoko Yamano) followed by a release number. (Release versions were 3, 3(b), 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5.)

The May 2003 release of Naoko 4.5 was followed very quickly by the removal of the program&#x27;s web site and Lemmon&#x27;s declared termination of continued development of Proxomitron. A subsequent release, however, was made in June 2003, primarily to revert a new behavior related to remote proxy connections that had been designed into the May version.

After the release of Naoko 4.5 (June), development was permanently discontinued and the official site had the message:

This reads in Japanese and translates to &quot;it went out&quot; or &quot;gone.&quot; The original home webpage is no longer accessible. Lemmon&#x27;s mirror redirect was changed to display a different final message from the author a short time later.

The author, Scott R. Lemmon, died 1 May 2004 aged 36.

== Current status ==
As this was a closed-source project, Proxomitron is no longer being maintained or developed; however, the Proxomitron program is still functional, and there is a community of users who provide support for it through electronic forums. Filters, filter sets, compatible DLLs and other files, and GUI patches to restyle and/or update Proxomitron&#x27;s graphical user interface are also being provided by users.

Many current browsers do contain features similar to those provided by Proxomitron filters – blocking advertisements and pop-ups, for example. Other browser features or add-ons, such as Greasemonkey for Firefox and user stylesheets for Firefox and other browsers via the Stylish addon, also allow for local modification of web pages.

<doc id="245041" wikidata="Q10563340" url="?curid=245041" title="List of Caribbean music genres">
<text>Caribbean music genres are very diverse. They are each synthesis of African, European, Arab, Asian and Indigenous influences, largely created by descendants of African slaves (see Afro-Caribbean music), along with contributions from other communities (such as Indo-Caribbean music). Some of the styles to gain wide popularity outside the Caribbean include, bachata, merengue, palo, mambo, baithak gana, bouyon, cadence-lypso, calypso, soca, chutney, chutney-soca, compas, dancehall, jing ping, parang, pichakaree, punta, ragga, reggae, dembow, reggaeton, salsa, and zouk. Caribbean music is also related to Central American and South American music.

The history of Caribbean music originates from the history of the Caribbean itself. That history is one of the native land invaded by outsiders; violence, slavery, and even genocide factor in.

Following Christopher Columbus&#x27; landing in 1492, Spain laid claim to the entire Caribbean. This claim was met with dissatisfaction from both the natives and Spain&#x27;s neighbors in Europe; within a few years, bloody battles between the European powers raged across the region. These battles, alongside the various European diseases which accompanied them, decimated the native tribes who inhabited the islands.

Thus the Caribbean was colonized as part of the various European empires. Native cultures were further eroded when the Europeans imported African slaves to work the sugar and coffee plantations on their island colonies. In many cases, native cultures (and native musics) were replaced by those imported from Africa and Europe.

At this point, whatever common Caribbean culture existed was splintered. Each of the European powers had imposed its own culture on the islands they had claimed. In the late 20th century, many Caribbean islands gained independence from colonial rule but the European influences can still be heard in the music of each subtly different culture.

Island-specific culture also informs the music of the Caribbean. Every island has its distinct musical styles, all inspired, to one degree or another, by the music brought over from the African slaves. As such, most Caribbean music, however unique to its own island culture, includes elements of African music - heavy use of percussion, complex rhythmic patterns, and call-and-response vocals. In many cases, the difference between one style and another comes down to the rhythms utilized in each music; every island has its own rhythmic sensibilities.

The complex deep origins of Caribbean music are best understood with a knowledge of Western Hemisphere colonial immigration patterns, human trafficking patterns, the resulting melting pot of people each of its nations and territories, and thus resulting influx of original musical influences. Colonial Caribbean ancestors were predominantly from West Africa, West Europe and India. In the 20th and 21st centuries immigrants have also come from Taiwan, China, Indonesia/Java and the Middle East. Neighboring Latin American and North American (particularly hip hop and pop music) countries have also naturally influenced Caribbean culture and vice versa. While there are musical commonalities among Caribbean nations and territories, the variation in immigration patterns and colonial hegemony tend to parallel the variations in musical influence. Language barriers (Spanish, Portuguese, English, Hindustani, Tamil, Telugu, Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Yiddish, Yoruba, African languages, Indian languages, Amerindian languages, French, Indonesian, Javanese and Dutch) are one of the strongest influences.

Divisions between Caribbean music genres are not always well-defined, because many of these genres share common relations, instrumentation and have influenced each other in many ways and directions. For example, the Jamaican mento style has a long history of conflation with Trinidadian calypso. Elements of calypso have come to be used in mento, and vice versa, while their origins lie in the Caribbean culture, each uniquely characterized by influences from the Shango and Shouters religions of Trinidad and the &quot;Kumina&quot; spiritual tradition of Jamaica. Music from the Spanish-speaking areas of the Caribbean are classified as tropical music in the Latin music industry.

==Antigua and Barbuda==
By the mid-20th century Antigua and Barbuda boasted lively calypso and steelpan scenes as part of its annual Carnival celebration. Hell&#x27;s Gate, along with Brute Force and the Big Shell Steelband, were the first Caribbean steelbands to be recorded and featured on commercial records thanks to the efforts of the American record producer Emory Cook. Short Shirt, Swallow, and Obstinate were among the most popular calypsonians who competed in the island&#x27;s annual calypso competition.

===Benna===

Benna is an uptempo Antiguan folk song, also spelled &quot;bennah&quot; and known as &quot;ditti&quot;.

==Haiti==
===Compas / &quot;kompa&quot;===
Compas, short for &quot;compas direct&quot;, is the modern méringue (&quot;mereng&quot; in creole) that was popularized in the mid-1950s by the sax and guitar player Nemours Jean-Baptiste. His méringue soon became popular throughout the Antilles, especially in Martinique and Guadeloupe. Webert Sicot and Nemours Jean-Baptiste became the two leaders in the group. Sicot then left and formed a new group and an intense rivalry developed, though they remained good friends. To differentiate himself from Nemours, Sicot called his modern méringue, Cadence rampa.

In Creole, it is spelled as &quot;konpa dirèk&quot; or simply &quot;konpa&quot;. It is commonly spelled as it is pronounced as &quot;kompa&quot;.

===Méringue===
Evolving in Haiti during the mid-1800s, the Haitian méringue (known as the &quot;mereng&quot; in creole) is regarded as the oldest surviving form of its kind performed today and is its national symbol. According to Jean Fouchard, mereng evolved from the fusion of slave music genres (such as the &quot;chica&quot; and &quot;calenda&quot;) with ballroom forms related to the French-Haitian contredanse (&quot;kontradans&quot; in creole). Mereng&#x27;s name, he says, derives from the &quot;mouringue&quot; music of the Bara, a tribe of Madagascar. That few Malagasies came to the Americas casts doubt on this etymology, but it is significant because it emphasizes what Fouchard (and most Haitians) consider the African-derived nature of their music and national identity. Méringue has lost popularity to konpa.

===Mizik rasin===
Mizik rasin is a musical movement that began in Haïti in 1987 when musicians began combining elements of traditional Haitian &quot;Vodou&quot; ceremonial and folkloric music with rock and roll. This style of modern music reaching back to the roots of &quot;Vodou&quot; tradition came to be called &quot;mizik rasin&quot; (&quot;roots music&quot;) in Haitian Creole or &quot;musique racine&quot; in French. In context, the movement is often referred to simply as &quot;rasin&quot; or &quot;racine&quot;.

Starting in the late 1970s (with discontent surrounding the increasing opulence of the Duvalier dictatorship), youth from Port-au-Prince (and to a lesser extent Cap-Haïtien and other urban areas) began experimenting with new types of life. François Duvalier&#x27;s appropriation of Vodou images as a terror technique, the increase in U.S. assembly and large-scale export agriculture, the popularity of disco, and Jean-Claude Duvalier&#x27;s appreciation of konpa and chanson française disillusioned many youth and love.

To question the dictatorship&#x27;s notion of &quot;the Haitian nation&quot; (and thus the dictatorship itself), several men began trying a new way of living, embodied in the Sanba Movement. They drew upon global trends in black power, Bob Marley, &quot;Hippie&quot;-dom, as well as prominently from rural life in Haiti. They dressed in the traditional blue denim (karoko) of peasants, eschewed the commercialized and processed life offered by global capitalism, and celebrated the values of communal living. Later, they adopted matted hair which resembled dreadlocks, but identified the style as something which existed in Haiti with the term cheve simbi, referring to water spirits.

In the 1990s, commercial success came to the musical genre that came to be known as &quot;mizik rasin&quot;, or &quot;roots music&quot;. Musicians like Boukman Eksperyans, and Boukan Ginen, and to a lesser extent RAM, incorporated reggae, rock and funk rhythms into traditional forms and instrumentation, including &quot;rara&quot;, music from &quot;kanaval&quot;, or traditional spiritual music from the rural hamlets called lakous, like Lakou Souvnans, Lakou Badjo, Lakou Soukri, or Lakou Dereyal.

===Twoubadou===
Twoubadou is another form of folk music played by peripatetic troubadours playing some combination of acoustic, guitar, beat box and accordion instruments singing ballads of Haitian, French or Caribbean origin. It is in some ways similar to Son Cubano from Cuba as a result of Haitian migrant laborers who went to work on Cuban sugar plantations at the turn of the century. Musicians perform at the Port-au-Prince International Airport and also at bars and restaurants in Pétion-Ville.

== Jamaica ==

Jamaica has sometimes been considered the world&#x27;s least populous cultural superpower, especially with its influence on music. The music of Jamaica includes Jamaican folk music and many popular genres, such as mento, ska, rocksteady, reggae, dub music, dancehall, reggae fusion and related styles.

Mento, often considered Jamaica&#x27;s first popular music genre, developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is a lively, acoustic form of music that blends African rhythms with European folk melodies, reflecting the island&#x27;s cultural hybridity. Characterized by the use of instruments such as the banjo, rumba box (a bass instrument), and hand drums, mento often features humorous and satirical lyrics that comment on social issues and everyday life. The genre gained popularity in the 1940s and 1950s, serving as a precursor to ska and reggae.

Ska emerged in the late 1950s as Jamaica&#x27;s first truly modern music genre. It combined elements of mento, American jazz, rhythm and blues, and Caribbean calypso. Known for its upbeat tempo, offbeat guitar strumming, and prominent brass sections, ska became a symbol of national pride in post-independence Jamaica. The genre&#x27;s themes often addressed social and political issues while maintaining a danceable and celebratory feel. Ska would later evolve into rocksteady, a slower and more soulful offshoot.

Rocksteady, which gained popularity in the mid-1960s, marked a transition from ska to reggae. It slowed down the tempo of ska, emphasizing smoother rhythms and more introspective lyrics. The bassline became a central feature, and themes often revolved around love, social struggles, and Rastafarian beliefs. Rocksteady was short-lived as a dominant genre but played a crucial role in shaping reggae, with many iconic Jamaican artists beginning their careers in this style.

Reggae, Jamaica&#x27;s most globally recognized genre, emerged in the late 1960s. It is characterized by its slow tempo, offbeat rhythm, and socially conscious lyrics that address issues such as poverty, oppression, spirituality, and resistance. Reggae became a vehicle for the Rastafarian movement, promoting messages of peace, unity, and liberation. Bob Marley, one of the genre&#x27;s pioneers, brought reggae to international prominence, making it a symbol of Jamaican identity and cultural influence worldwide.

Dub music, a subgenre of reggae, originated in the late 1960s and early 1970s as producers experimented with remixing tracks. It emphasizes instrumental versions of songs, featuring heavy use of reverb, echo, and bass. Dub is known for its innovative sound manipulation techniques, often creating a hypnotic and immersive listening experience. The genre greatly influenced electronic music and remix culture globally.

Dancehall emerged in the late 1970s and became one of Jamaica&#x27;s most popular and enduring genres. It is characterized by its digital rhythms, faster tempos, and often risqué or humorous lyrics. Dancehall reflects urban Jamaican life, with themes ranging from romance and partying to social critique. The genre gave rise to iconic artists like Shabba Ranks, Beenie Man, and Sean Paul, who helped popularize it internationally.

Reggae fusion, a modern evolution of Jamaican music, blends reggae and dancehall with elements of pop, hip-hop, R&amp;B, and other genres. Emerging in the late 20th century, reggae fusion appeals to global audiences while maintaining its Jamaican roots. Artists like Shaggy, Sean Paul, and Rihanna have incorporated reggae fusion into their music, continuing Jamaica&#x27;s legacy of cultural influence on the world stage.

==Saint Lucia==
&quot;Jwé&quot; is a kind of rural music from Saint Lucia, performed informally at wakes, beach parties, full moon gatherings and other events, including &quot;débòt&quot; dances. Jwé uses raunchy lyrics and innuendos to show off verbal skills, and to express political and comedic commentaries on current events and well-known individuals. One well-known technique that has entered Lucian culture is &quot;lang dévivé&quot;, which is when the singer says the opposite of his true meaning. Other genres include:

* Calypso
* Extempo
* Kont
* Soca
* Zouk
* Dancehall
* Dub
* Reggae
==Saint Vincent and the Grenadines==
Big Drum is a style found in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and elsewhere in the Windward Islands, especially Carriacou. It is accompanied by drums traditionally made from tree trunks, though rum kegs are now more common. Satirical and political lyrics are common, performed by a female singer called a &quot;chantwell&quot; and accompanied by colorfully costumed dancers. Big Drum is performed at celebrations like weddings and the launchings of new boats. Chutney-soca is another genre.

==Suriname==
Kaseko is a music genre that originated in Suriname. The term &quot;Kaseko&quot; is probably derived from the French expression &quot;casser le corps (break the body)&quot;, which was used during slavery to indicate a very swift dance. It is a fusion of numerous popular and folk styles. It is rhythmically complex, with percussion instruments including skratji (a very large bass drum). Songs are typically call-and-response.

Other genres include:

* Baithak Gana
* Indo-Caribbean
* Aleke
* Kawina
==Trinidad and Tobago==

===Calypso===

Calypso is a Trinidadian music, which traditionally uses a slow tempo to accompany vocalist-composers, or &quot;calypsonians&quot;. Songs are often improvised and humorous, with sexual innuendo, political and social commentary, and &quot;picong&quot;, a style of lyricism that teases people in a light-hearted way. Calypso is competitively performed in calypso tents at Carnival. Calypso uses rhythms derived from West Africa, with cut time, and features dance as an important component. Calypso&#x27;s roots were frequently ascribed to the Bahamas, Jamaica, Bermuda or the Virgin Islands. Calypso can be traced back to at least 1859, when a visiting ornithologist in Trinidad ascribed calypso&#x27;s origins in British ballads. While calypso has a diverse heritage, calypso became a distinct genre when it developed in Trinidad. The word &quot;caliso&quot; refers to &quot;topical songs&quot; in the dialect of Saint Lucia, and may be linguistically related to the word &quot;calypso&quot;.

===Cariso===

Cariso is a kind of Trinidadian folk music, and an important ancestor of calypso music. It is lyrically topical, and frequently sarcastic or mocking in the &quot;picong&quot; tradition, and is sung primarily in French creole by singers called &quot;chantwells&quot;. &quot;Cariso&quot; may come from &quot;carieto&quot;, a Carib word meaning &quot;joyous song&quot;, and can also be used synonymously with &quot;careso&quot;.

===Chutney===
Chutney is a form indigenous to the southern Caribbean, popular in Guyana, Trinidad, Jamaica and Suriname. It derives elements from traditional Indian music and popular Trinidadian Soca music.

===Soca===
Soca is a style of Caribbean music originating in Trinidad and Tobago.

Soca originally combined the melodic lilting sound of calypso with insistent cadence|cadence-lypso percussion (which is often electronic in recent music), and Indian musical instruments—particularly the dholak, tabla and dhantal—as demonstrated in Shorty&#x27;s classic compositions &quot;Ïndrani&quot; and &quot;Shanti Om&quot;. During the 80&#x27;s, the influence of zouk which was derived from cadence-lypso music from Dominica as popularized by the French Antillean band Kassav&#x27; had a major impact on the development of modern soca music.

==Virgin Islands==

===Careso===
*&quot;Careso&quot; is a Virgin Islander song form, which is now entirely performed for special holiday and appreciation or education events, by folkloric ensembles. It is similar to &quot;quelbe&quot; in some ways, but has more sustained syllables, a more African melodic style and an all female, call and response format with lyrics that function as news and gossip communicator, also commemorating and celebrating historical events.

===Other===
* Scratch band
* Bamboula
* Masquerade music

===Quelbe===

Quelbe is a form of Virgin Islander folk music that originated on St. Croix, now most commonly performed by groups called &quot;scratch bands&quot;. Traditionally, however, quelbe was performed informally by solo singers at festivals and other celebrations. Hidden meanings and sexual innuendos were common, and lyrics focused on political events like boycotts.

<text>Mars, Incorporated (doing business as Mars Inc.) is an American multinational manufacturer of confectionery, pet food, and other food products and a provider of animal care services founded on June 23, 1911, headquartered in McLean, Virginia, and is entirely owned by the Mars family. The company had US$45 billion in annual sales in 2022; that year &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked the company as the fourth-largest privately held company in the United States. 

Mars operates in four subsidiaries around the world: Mars Wrigley Confectionery (headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, with U.S. headquarters in Hackettstown and Newark, New Jersey), Petcare (Zaventem, Belgium; Poncitlán, Jalisco, Mexico; Querétaro, Mexico), Food (Rancho Dominguez, California), and MARS Edge (Germantown, Maryland), the company&#x27;s life sciences division.

==History==

Franklin Clarence Mars, whose mother taught him to hand dip candy, sold candy by age 19. He started the Mars Candy Factory on June 23, 1911 with Ethel V. Mars, his second wife, in Tacoma, Washington. This factory produced and sold fresh candy wholesale, but ultimately the venture failed because there was a better established business, Brown &amp; Haley, also operating in Tacoma. By 1920, Mars had returned to his home state, Minnesota, where the earliest incarnation of the present day Mars company was founded that year as Mar-O-Bar Co., in Minneapolis and later incorporated there as Mars, Incorporated.

Forrest Mars Sr., son of Frank and his first wife, Ethel G. Mars, was inspired by a popular type of milkshake in 1923, to introduce the Milky Way bar, advertised as a &quot;chocolate malted milk in a candy bar&quot;, which became the best-selling candy bar. In 1929, Frank moved the company to Chicago and started full production in a plant which still exists today. In 1930, Frank Mars created the Snickers bar and first sold it in US markets. In 1932, Mars introduced the 3 Musketeers bar. The same year, Forrest started Mars Limited in the United Kingdom and launched the Mars bar.

Mars moved its headquarters to McLean, Virginia, in 1984

In 2001, Mars purchased the Lucas candy company. In 2004, Lucas was discontinued when high amounts of lead were found inside of their candies. 

Mars&#x27;s purchase of Doane Petcare Company in June 2007 significantly increased Mars&#x27;s position in the U.S. dry pet food category. In addition to these businesses, Mars also operates a chain of premium chocolate shops called Ethel M Chocolates. These shops are an outgrowth of the Ethel M premium chocolate business that Forrest Mars started in Las Vegas in 1980 when he became bored with retirement.

From May 1, 2007, many Mars products made in the UK became unsuitable for vegetarians. The company announced that it would be using whey made with animal rennet (material from a calf&#x27;s stomach lining, and a byproduct of veal), instead of using rennet made by microorganisms, in products including Mars, Twix, Snickers, Maltesers, Bounty, Minstrels and Milky Way. The response from many consumers, particularly the Vegetarian Society&#x27;s request for UK vegetarians to register their protests with Mars, generated extensive press and caused the company to abandon the plans shortly thereafter. Mars switched to all-vegetarian sources in the UK.

In 2008, Mars and theBelGroup conducted a research study that resurrected the famous Mars slogan &quot;Work, Rest &amp; Play&quot;. Packaged and led the global launch of the Mars Refuel Sports drink. Initiated and implemented sponsorship program &quot;The Mars Refuel Drink Fund&quot;.

On April 28, 2008, Mars, Incorporated, together with Berkshire Hathaway Incorporated, announced the buyout of Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, the world&#x27;s largest chewing gum producer, for $23 billion in an all-cash deal. The two companies together generated sales of over $30 billion in 2008.

The company published its Principles in Action communication in September 2011. This communication outlines the history of Mars, its legacy as a business committed to its Five Principles, and the company&#x27;s goal of putting its Principles into action to make a difference to people and the planet through performance. Encompassing themes of Health and Nutrition, Supply Chain, Operations, Products, and Working at Mars, the Principles in Action communication outlines Mars, Incorporated&#x27;s targets, progress, and ongoing challenges. It also describes its businesses, including Petcare, Chocolate, Wrigley, Food, Drinks, Symbioscience.

The company spent more than $1.8 million on lobbying during 2008, almost all of it at Patton Boggs, where it has long been one of the largest lobbying clients. Mars also spent $10,000 at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. In 2009, Mars also hired Ernst &amp; Young to lobby on corporate and international tax issues, including issues related to tax changes proposed by the Obama administration. The company spent another $1,655,000 that year.

In February 2016, Mars stated that it would no longer be using artificial colors in any of its candy products.
In 2016, Mars Inc. announced the merger of its chocolate and Wrigley segments to form a new subsidiary, called Mars Wrigley Confectionery.

In 2017, the company&#x27;s confectionery segment announced a return to its roots, and opened a new office in Newark, New Jersey.

In May 2020, Mars filed a lawsuit against JAB Holding over claims that Jacek Szarzynski, a former JAB Holding executive stole various confidential documents and passed them to the owner of Pret A Manger and Panera Bread. According to the lawsuit, over 6,000 Mars internal documents, including detailed financial results, strategic planning documents, and potential acquisition targets, were illegally downloaded.

In the United States, the company has 22 manufacturing facilities in Hackettstown, New Jersey; Albany, Georgia; Burr Ridge, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Chicago, Illinois; and Mattoon, Illinois; Cleveland, Tennessee; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Columbia, South Carolina; Columbus, Ohio; Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania; Greenville, Mississippi; Greenville and Waco, Texas; Henderson and Reno, Nevada; Fort Smith, Arkansas; Joplin, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri; Miami, Oklahoma; and Galena, Kansas. Their newest chocolate producing facility, the first in 23 years, was established in 2014 at a cost of $270 million and is situated in Topeka, Kansas. Their Canadian facilities are located in Bolton and Newmarket, Ontario.

In November 2020, Mars acquired full ownership of snack food company Kind North America for $5 billion. Two years later in December 2022, it was announced Mars had acquired the Utah headquartered whole-fruit snacking brand, Trü Frü. A further acquisition was made in November 2023 when Mars purchased the Hotel Chocolat for £534 million.

On September 1, 2023, Ukraine&#x27;s National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NACP) has included two leading food corporations, PepsiCo and Mars, on the list of international sponsors of the war. Despite the declaration of reduction of their business, cessation of advertising activities, and production of their products, they continue to work in the Russian Federation.

===Kellanova acquisition===
On August 14, 2024, Mars Inc. announced its acquisition of Kellanova for $83.50 per share in cash, for a total consideration of $35.9 billion, including assumed net leverage. According to the companies, this is the largest acquisition of 2024 to date, while analysts described it as the largest CPG transaction since the merger between Kraft and H.J. Heinz in 2015. 

The agreement has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of Kellanova. The transaction is subject to Kellanova shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to close within the first half of 2025. The transaction agreement permits Kellanova to declare and pay quarterly dividends that are consistent with historical practice prior to the closing of the transaction.

==Mars Food UK Limited==

In 1932, Forrest Mars Sr. opened what was then Mars (Europe) headquarters, and remains Mars (UK) headquarters in Slough, Berkshire on the then-new Slough Trading Estate, after a disagreement with his father, Franklin Clarence Mars. In this factory, he produced the first Mars bar, based on the American Milky Way. The company branch is currently known as &quot;Mars Food UK Limited&quot; in the United Kingdom. Mars brands manufactured for the United Kingdom market but not for the United States include Tunes.

Many brands first created and sold in the United Kingdom were later introduced in the United States, including Starburst (original UK brand name Opal Fruits) and Skittles. The brands Twix and Topic were UK based.

Milky Way in Europe and worldwide is known as the 3 Musketeers in America. Similarly, the Snickers bar was previously marketed in Ireland and the United Kingdom as Marathon until 1990; in the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands, also until 1990; Galaxy in the Middle East is known as Dove in America and worldwide. Chocolate and peanut M&amp;M&#x27;s were introduced in 1980s.

===Mars Drinks UK===
Mars Drinks UK, the beverages division of Mars Limited, operates from Slough in Berkshire and specializes in office vending machines. Mars Drinks UK comprises the FLAVIA and KLIX brands which offer branded drinks such as the Starburst Orange Drink, the Maltesers Hot Chocolate and the Galaxy drinks.

Mars Drinks also produces coffee and the equipment used to make it. In 1982 FLAVIA was created out of the high demand for coffee in the United Kingdom. Initially marketed as &quot;Dimension 3&quot; until 1989, FLAVIA was introduced in France and Germany in 1986 and Japan in 1992 then brought to the United States in 1996 and to Canada in 1997. Other products such as cappuccino were introduced in 2002 and tea in 2004.

In 2018, the Drinks division was sold to Lavazza.

==Mars Petcare==
Forrest Mars started the pet food industry in Europe, and his Mars Candy Company bought Kal Kan. Forrest Mars changed the name of Kal Kan dog food to Pedigree, and Kal Kan cat food to Whiskas. As of 1991, Mars controlled 60 percent of the pet food market, both in volume and value. Whiskas was the number one brand. As of 1994, Mars was the leading pet food company worldwide with $4 billion in sales.

In February 2003, Mars acquired Aquarium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (API, incorporated in 1964) and in 2007 it was renamed Mars Fishcare, Inc. The company manufactures and supplies home aquarium and pond products. Mars Fishcare brands include: &quot;Aquarium Pharmaceuticals (API)&quot;, &quot;RENA&quot;, &quot;AQUARIAN&quot;, and &quot;PondCare&quot;.

The company introduced a genetic test for dogs using cheek swabs to identify breed breakdown, trait tests and health risks in 2007 known as Wisdom Panel. In 2018, Mars Petcare acquired Genoscoper Laboratories, a Finnish animal molecular diagnostics company, &quot;to form the basis for future practical applications in enabling precision healthcare for pets&quot; under its genetic testing unit, Wisdom Health. Wisdom Panel DNA testing expanded to include cats in mid 2021.

In Australia, the division operates three sites that are located in Wodonga, Victoria (established in 1967 for manufacture of wet pet food); Bathurst, New South Wales (established in the 1980s for manufacture of dry pet food); and Brisbane, Queensland (for manufacture of birdcare products).

Mars Petcare manufactures the &#x27;Trill&#x27; birdseed range.

=== Mars Veterinary Health ===
In 2007, Mars, Incorporated purchased a significant stake in the Banfield Pet Hospital chain.

In October 2015, BluePearl Veterinary Partners was acquired by Mars Petcare division. This acquisition resulted in Mars Petcare becoming the largest pet nutrition and veterinary care provider in the world.

In January 2017, Mars Veterinary Health North America announced the US$7.7 billion acquisition of Los Angeles-based animal hospital chain VCA Inc.

In June 2018, Mars Veterinary Health International and Diagnostics acquired the Linnaeus Group consolidating its position as a leading veterinary provider in the United Kingdom.

==Factories==
In 1963, a large factory was opened in Veghel in the Netherlands. This factory has currently the biggest production volume of Mars factories and is one of the biggest chocolate factories in the world. Most confectionery products for Europe were produced in Slough and Veghel. The two factories in Slough were located on Liverpool Road and Dundee Road; the one on Liverpool Road closed in 2007, with Twix production moving to the Netherlands and Starburst production moving to the Czech Republic.

The major production plant for Mars confectionery products in Australia is in Ballarat, Victoria.

There is one factory outside of Hershey, Pennsylvania, located in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania. The factory in Chicago, Illinois, has its own commuter rail station, simply named Mars. The company announced in early 2022 that it intends to close the Chicago factory in 2024. The building will remain in the hands of Chicago&#x27;s Galewood neighborhood residents.

==Awards and honors==
The company was named by &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine as one of the top 100 companies to work for in 2013, citing the example that employees of the pet food division can take their dogs to work.

The company has made donations to Elizabethtown College, which includes a room sponsored by them and a weekly executive lecture series.

==Consumer relations==
Mars remains a family business owned by the Mars family. The company is famous for its secrecy. A 1993 &quot;Washington Post Magazine&quot; article was a rare raising of the veil, as the reporter was able to see the &quot;M&quot;s being applied to the M&amp;M&#x27;s, something that &quot;no outsider had ever before been invited to observe&quot;. In 1999, for example, the company did not acknowledge that Forrest Mars Sr. had died or that he had worked for the company. As of 2019, the company had &quot;aggressively&quot; moved away from its model of secrecy through the media and sponsorships.

==Controversies==
=== Unethical treatment of animals ===
In 2007, Mars came under criticism from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) for funding laboratory experiments on mice, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits, which the group alleges are inhumane and in violation of the company&#x27;s own policies prohibiting experiments on animals.

One study was conducted in collaboration with the Salk Institute regarding angiogenesis and spatial memory, in which mice were given an &quot;ad-lib&quot; diet that included epicatechin, plant-derived flavonoid. One of the experiments involved groups of control and experimental animals, the latter of which were housed individually in cages that included a running wheel for optional exercise for two hours a day. The former, also housed individually, did not have access to a running wheel. Another experiment was the classical spatial memory assay, the Morris water maze, in which experimenters had mice swim in water mixed with white paint that concealed the water depth. The study, which Mars contends was legally required in order for the company to make flavonoid-related health claims, showed that the inclusion of epicatechin in the diet improved memory and angiogenesis, more so if coupled with exercise.

=== Child labor and slave labor ===
Mars has been criticized for buying cocoa beans from West African farmers who reportedly use unpaid or poorly paid child laborers. In 2009, Mars announced that the company would work towards only purchasing cocoa from suppliers who meet environmental, labor, and production standards. TransFair USA, an organization which certifies products as Fair Trade, applauded the move and expressed hope that it would include a provision for fair wages for laborers and farmers. In 2010, Mars Inc. received the U.S. Secretary of State&#x27;s Award for Corporate Excellence. In April 2010, Mars launched the MyCocoaPaper initiative, which claims to provide economic opportunities to women and families in Indonesia by making paper products out of cocoa bark and recycled office paper.

In 2011, Mars and Fairtrade International announced an agreement to introduce the first Fairtrade labeled Mars product and to work together to enable farmers to have sustainable livelihoods and substantially increased productivity. The first Mars product to carry the Fairtrade mark was Maltesers, which appeared in stores in 2012 in the UK and Ireland.

In 2019, Mars announced that they could not guarantee that their chocolate products were free from child slave labor, as they could trace only 24% of their purchasing back to the farm level (see below). The &quot;Washington Post&quot; noted that the commitment taken in 2001 to eradicate such practices within 4 years had not been kept, neither at the due deadline of 2005, nor within the revised deadlines of 2008 and 2010, and that the result was not likely to be achieved for 2020 either.

In 2021, Mars was named in a class action lawsuit filed by eight former child slaves from Mali who alleged that the company aided and abetted their enslavement on cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast. The suit accused Mars (along with Nestlé, Cargill, Barry Callebaut, Olam International, the Hershey Company, and Mondelez International) of knowingly engaging in forced labor, and the plaintiffs sought damages for unjust enrichment, negligent supervision, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In June 2021, the United States Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds that as the abuse had happened outside the United States, the group did not have standing to file such a lawsuit.

Mars scored a yellow rating, the second highest of four possible scores, &quot;Starting to implement good policies&quot;, on the 2022 Chocolate Scorecard, which rates all the large chocolate companies on their record in eliminating child labour, providing a living income to cocoa farmers and traceability/transparency. In its own scorecard on human rights and environmental credentials, Mars states that it has traced the source of their cocoa to 132,000 of the farms that supply their cocoa.

A CBS television news investigation in 2023 found children as young as five years old working in the Ghana supply chain of Mars to harvest cocoa for brands such as Snickers and M&amp;Ms.

=== Deforestation in African national parks ===
In September 2017, an investigation conducted by NGO Mighty Earth found that a large amount of the cocoa used in chocolate produced by Mars and other major chocolate companies was grown illegally in national parks and other protected areas in Ivory Coast and Ghana. The countries are the world&#x27;s two largest cocoa producers.

The report documents show, in several national parks and other protected areas, 90% or more of the land mass has been converted to cocoa. Less than four percent of Ivory Coast remains densely forested, and the chocolate companies&#x27; laissez-faire approach to sourcing has driven extensive deforestation in Ghana as well. In Ivory Coast, deforestation has pushed chimpanzees into just a few small pockets, and reduced the country&#x27;s elephant population from several hundred thousand to about 200–400.

On the 2022 Chocolate Scorecard, Mars scored the second highest of four possible scores for &quot;Deforestation and Climate&quot; and &quot;Agroforestry&quot;, &quot;starting to implement good policies&quot;. Mars scored a lower rating (third of the four) for &quot;Agrochemical Management&quot;, &quot;needs more work on policy and implementation&quot;.

<doc id="245069" wikidata="Q217338" url="?curid=245069" title="Casio">
<text>is a Japanese multinational electronics manufacturing corporation headquartered in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan. Its products include calculators, mobile phones, digital cameras, electronic musical instruments, and analogue and digital watches. It was founded in 1946, and in 1957 introduced the first entirely compact electronic calculator. It was an early digital camera innovator, and during the 1980s and 1990s, the company developed numerous affordable home electronic keyboards for musicians along with introducing the first mass-produced digital watches.

==History==
Casio was established as Kashio Seisakujo in April 1946 by (1917–1993), an engineer specializing in fabrication technology. Kashio&#x27;s first major product was the yubiwa pipe, a finger ring that would hold a cigarette, allowing the wearer to smoke the cigarette down to its nub while also leaving the wearer&#x27;s hands free. Japan was impoverished immediately following World War II, so cigarettes were valuable, and the invention was a success.

After seeing the electric calculators at the first Business Show in Ginza, Tokyo in 1949, Kashio and his younger brothers (Toshio, Kazuo, and Yukio) used their profits from the yubiwa pipe to develop their calculators. Most of the calculators at that time worked using gears and could be operated by hand using a crank or using a motor (see adding machine).
Toshio possessed some knowledge of electronics and set out to make a calculator using solenoids. After dozens of prototypes were tested, the desk-sized calculator was finished in 1954 and was Japan&#x27;s first electro-mechanical calculator. One of the central and more important innovations of the calculator was its adoption of the 10-key number pad; at that time other calculators were using a &quot;full keypad&quot;, which meant that each place in the number (1s, 10s, 100s, etc. ...) had nine keys. Another distinguishing innovation was the use of a single display window instead of the three display windows (one for each argument and one for the answer) used in other calculators.

Casio Computer Co., Ltd. was formed in June 1957. That year, Casio released the Model 14-A, sold for 485,000 yen, the first all-electric compact calculator, which was based on relay technology.

In 1974, Casio released their first digital wristwatch, called the CASIOTRON. It was the first wristwatch in the world to include an automatic calendar function. In 1977, they released a retro-futuristic wristwatch, called the F100. The watch was one of the first wristwatches in the world to be made primarily out of resin, making it very light compared to other companies&#x27; heavy metal-made watches and enabling future Casio watches to enter mass production more easily. In 1989, Casio released another important wristwatch; the F-91W, the most sold wristwatch in the world with an annual production of 3 million units.

In the 1980s, Casio&#x27;s budget electronic instruments and its line of affordable home electronic musical keyboard instruments became popular. The company also became well known for the wide variety and innovation of its wristwatches. It was one of the earliest manufacturers of quartz watches, both digital and analog. It also began selling calculator watches during this time. Casio also introduced one of the first watches that could display the time in many different time zones of the world and with features like recording temperature, atmospheric-pressure and altitude. In the later years, Casio&#x27;s wristwatches were fitted with receivers to synchronise with radio towers around the world and Global Positioning System for timekeeping accuracy.

A number of notable digital camera innovations have also been made by Casio, including the QV-10, the first consumer digital camera with a liquid-crystal display (LCD) on the back (developed by a team led by Hiroyuki Suetaka in 1995), the first consumer three-megapixel camera, the first true ultra-compact model, and the first digital camera to incorporate ceramic lens technology, using Lumicera.

In July 2019, the company&#x27;s UK arm, Casio Electronics Co. Ltd, was fined £3.7 million after admitting resale price maintenance (a form of price-fixing) on their line of digital keyboards and digital pianos between 2013 and 2018, in breach of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Competition Act 1998.

==Products==
Casio&#x27;s products include watches, calculators, electronic keyboards and other digital products such as digital cameras (Exilim series), film cameras, cash registers, laptops and sub-notebook computers, mobile phones, PDAs (E-Data Bank), electronic dictionaries, digital diaries (early PDAs), electronic games, personal computers (e.g. FP-1000, FP-200), computer printers, clocks, and portable televisions.

In the 1970s and 80s, Casio was best known for its electronic (including scientific) calculators, electronic musical instruments and affordable digital watches incorporating innovative technology. Today, Casio is most commonly known for making durable and reliable electronic products. The G-Shock range of shock-resistant watches is also very popular, with the original 1983 G-Shock DW-5000C being highly sought-after by collectors. The scientific calculators made by Casio especially the CLASSWIZ series of calculators are known for being affordable while incorporating a host of functions as compared to their competitors.

Casio also makes products for local markets, including &quot;Prayer Compass&quot; watch series designed to help Muslims pray on time and in the right direction.

<doc id="245071" wikidata="Q598017" url="?curid=245071" title="Tullia gens">
<text>The gens Tullia was a family at ancient Rome, with both patrician and plebeian branches. The first of this gens to obtain the consulship was Manius Tullius Longus in 500 BC, but the most illustrious of the family was Marcus Tullius Cicero, the statesman, orator, and scholar of the first century BC. The earliest of the Tullii who appear in history were patrician, but all of the Tullii mentioned in later times were plebeian, and some of them were descended from freedmen. The English form &quot;Tully&quot;, often found in older works, especially in reference to Cicero, is now considered antiquated.

==Origin==
The nomen &quot;Tullius&quot; is a patronymic surname, derived from the old Latin praenomen &quot;Tullus&quot;, probably from a root meaning to support, bear, or help. The Tullii of the Republic sometimes claimed descent from Servius Tullius, the sixth King of Rome, who according to some traditions was the son of Servius Tullius, a prince of Corniculum who was slain in battle against the Romans under Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, the fifth Roman king. However, the Roman historians report that the Tullii were one of the Alban noble families that came to Rome after the destruction of their city during the reign of Tullus Hostilius, the third King of Rome. This would probably make the Tullii one of the &quot;gentes minores&quot;, the lesser patrician houses of the Republic.

==Praenomina==
The main praenomina used by the Tullii were &quot;Marcus&quot; and &quot;Lucius&quot;. To these, the Tullii Cicerones added &quot;Quintus&quot;. &quot;Manius&quot; is found only among the patrician Tullii at the beginning of the Republic, and there are individual instances of &quot;Sextus&quot; and &quot;Tiberius&quot;.

==Branches and cognomina==
The patrician Tullii bore the cognomen &quot;Longus&quot;, tall, but only one of them appears in history. The notable plebeian families bore the surnames &quot;Decula&quot; and &quot;Cicero&quot;. The latter, among the most famous of Roman cognomina, belongs to a common class of surnames derived from familiar objects. This family came from Arpinum, the inhabitants of which were granted Roman citizenship in 188 BC. Plutarch reports that the surname was given to an ancestor of the orator, who had a cleft in the tip of his nose in the shape of a chickpea, or &quot;cicer&quot;. At the beginning of his career, Cicero was urged to adopt a more auspicious surname, but he declined, stating that he would make the name famous. Most other surnames found with the Tullii of the Republic belonged to freedmen, but a number of the family bore no cognomen.

==Members==
===Early Tullii===
* Servius Tullius, according to one tradition, the prince of Corniculum, husband of Ocrisia, and father of Servius Tullius, the sixth King of Rome, fell in battle when Corniculum was taken by Lucius Tarquinius Priscus.
* Servius Tullius Ser. f., the sixth King of Rome, traditionally reigned from 578 to 534 BC. He is said to have defeated Veii, enlarged the sacred boundary of Rome, and enclosed the city with a stone wall, established the Temple of Diana, and an alliance with the Latins, and undertook significant reforms of the Roman constitution, establishing the Comitia Centuriata and the Servian tribes.
* Marcus Tullius, a &quot;duumvir sacris faciundis&quot; in the reign of Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last King of Rome, was paid by a certain Petronius Sabinus to allow him to copy one of the Sibylline books. The king punished Tullius by having him sewn into a leather sack, and cast into the sea.
* Manius Tullius Longus, consul in 500 BC, besieged the city of Fidenae when its inhabitants revolted, but withdrew his army when the Fidenates sought to negotiate a peace. He and his colleague then suppressed a conspiracy to restore the Tarquins. While opening the Ludi Romani, Tullius was badly injured when he fell from his chariot. He died three days later.
* Manius Tullius Tolerinus, according to Festus, one of several persons burned at the Circus Maximus in 486 BC, possibly on the charge of conspiring with Spurius Cassius Vecellinus.
* Attius Tullius, a leader of the Volscians early in the fifth century BC, who gave shelter to Gaius Marcius Coriolanus following his exile from Rome, and encouraged him to take up arms against the Romans.
* Sextus Tullius, a centurion primus pilus in 358 BC, sought permission from the dictator Gaius Sulpicius Peticus to engage the Gauls in battle. He and his colleagues fought with conspicuous bravery. His martial prowess was displayed again in the following year, when he served under the consul Gaius Marcius Rutilus at Privernum.

===Tullii Cicerones===
* Marcus Tullius Cicero, grandfather of the orator, was one of the leading men of Arpinum. In 115 BC, the consul Marcus Aemilius Scaurus complimented him on his industry and foresight when he and his brother-in-law, Marcus Gratidius, petitioned on behalf of their city for the right to vote by ballot.
* Marcus Tullius M. f. Cicero, father of the orator Cicero, was a learned man of literary interests, and moved to Rome in order to provide the best of education for his sons. He kept company with the leading orators and jurists of his day, and died in 64 BC, the year his son was elected consul.
* Lucius Tullius M. f. Cicero, uncle of the orator, was a close friend of Marcus Antonius, the orator, with whom he traveled to Cilicia during the latter&#x27;s government there. He provided his nephew with regular correspondence for a number of years.
* Marcus Tullius M. f. M. n. Cicero, the orator, was consul in 63 BC, when he suppressed the conspiracy of Catiline, although he was later exiled for having put the conspirators to death without a trial. After his recall, he generally opposed the first triumvirate, and Caesar in particular, although Caesar deeply admired him, and gladly pardoned him for siding with his enemies. He played no part in Caesar&#x27;s assassination, but was friend and advisor to the conspirators, and placed himself in opposition to the second triumvirate, by which he was proscribed and put to death. Cicero was the most eminent of the Roman orators, and one of the leading scholars of Roman history and institutions. His vast body of surviving speeches, treatises, and correspondence forms one of the most important sources of Roman history.
* Quintus Tullius M. f. M. n. Cicero, the younger brother of Cicero, was praetor in 62 BC, and subsequently governor of Asia. He was one of Caesar&#x27;s generals during the Gallic Wars, but later supported Pompeius during the Civil War. After Caesar&#x27;s murder, he was proscribed and put to death by the triumvirs.
* Lucius Tullius L. f. M. n. Cicero, the cousin and close friend of the orator, whom he accompanied to Athens in 79 BC, and assisted during the trial of Verres. The people of Syracuse honoured him for his efforts on their behalf. Marcus was deeply aggrieved when Lucius died in 68, while still a young man.
* Tullia L. f. M. n., cousin of the orator and wife of Lucius Aelius Tubero.
* Tullia M. f. M. n., or &quot;Tulliola&quot;, the beloved daughter of Cicero, married first Gaius Calpurnius Piso Frugi, who died in 57 BC, then briefly to Furius Crassipes, whom she divorced, then in 50 to Publius Cornelius Dolabella, by whom she had two sons; one who died in infancy, and another, Lentulus, who probably died in childhood. Tullia and Dolabella were divorced before the birth of their second son, and she died shortly afterward, to her father&#x27;s great sorrow.
* Quintus Tullius Q. f. M. n. Cicero, son of Quintus Cicero, attempted to hide his father from the triumvirs, and was tortured, then put to death along with his father, who gave himself up in the hope of saving his son.
* Marcus Tullius M. f. M. n. Cicero, son of the orator, joined the &quot;liberatores&quot;, Brutus and Cassius after the murder of his father and uncle in the proscription of the triumvirs. He obtained the pardon of Octavian after the Battle of Philippi, and later took his side against Mark Antony. He was consul in 30 BC.

===Others===
* Marcus Tullius, &quot;triumvir monetalis&quot; in 120 BC. He was perhaps the father of Marcus Tullius Decula, the consul of 81 BC.
* Marcus Tullius Decula, consul in 81 BC, during the dictatorship of Sulla.
* Marcus Tullius, claimed that his neighbor, Publius Fabius, with whom he was engaged in a property dispute, had murdered several of his slaves. Cicero spoke on his behalf in a partially-preserved speech. He does not seem to be identified with any of the other Marci Tullii known from this period of history.
* Lucius Tullius, an &quot;eques&quot;, was leader of those who collected the taxes from the &quot;scriptura&quot;, the cattle grazed upon public land, in Sicily in the time of Verres.
* Lucius Tullius, a friend of Titus Pomponius Atticus, served as a legate under Cicero during his government of Cilicia. Cicero did not consider his performance adequate.
* Marcus Tullius M. l. Tiro, a scribe and freedman of Cicero, became a notable author in his own right. He wrote on the Latin language, and a life of Cicero, which has been lost; he may have been the chief compiler and preserver of Cicero&#x27;s correspondence. He was credited with inventing a variety of shorthand, and to have lived to the age of one hundred.
* Marcus Tullius M. f. Laurea, apparently the same man as Laurea Tullius, a freedman of Cicero, who was known for his elegiac poetry, and several epigrams that have survived to the modern day.
* Tullius Rufus, a partisan of Pompeius, who was killed at the Battle of Thapsus in 46 BC. He had been quaestor, but the year is uncertain.
* Tiberius Tullius, a partisan of Pompeius during the war in Spain, in 45 BC.
* Tullius Bassus, or possibly &quot;Julius&quot; Bassus, a writer on medicine and botany, perhaps belonging to the early first century.
* Lucius Tullius Montanus, a companion of the younger Marcus Tullius Cicero on his journey to Athens in 45 BC.
* Lucius Tullius Cimber, a misreading of Lucius &quot;Tillius&quot; Cimber, one of Caesar&#x27;s assassins.
* Tullius Senecio, one of Nero&#x27;s friends, who joined in the Pisonian conspiracy, and was forced to take his own life after his participation was discovered.
* Tullius Flavianus, a cavalry commander serving under Quintus Petillius Cerialis during the civil war between Vitellius and Vespasian. He was captured by Vitellius while fighting in the neighborhood of Rome.
* Tullius Valentinus, one of the leaders of the Treveri in AD 70, during the Batavian Rebellion. He joined with Julius Tutor in opposing Quintus Petillius Cerialis, and put to death the legates of two legions that had surrendered to Julius Classicus, but was captured by Cerealis at Rigodulum, and was sent to Mucianus and Domitian, by whom he was put to death.
* Publius Tullius Varro, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in April of AD 127.
* Tullius Geminus, a poet whose epigrams are preserved in the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;. The surviving examples describe works of art, and display a number of affectations. A few epigrams attributed solely to &quot;Tullius&quot; might have been authored by either Tullius Geminus or Marcus Tullius Laurea.

<doc id="245073" wikidata="Q1347437" url="?curid=245073" title="The School of Night">
<text>The School of Night is a modern name for a group of men centred on Sir Walter Raleigh that was once referred to in 1592 as the &quot;School of Atheism&quot;. The group supposedly included poets and scientists Christopher Marlowe, George Chapman, Matthew Roydon and Thomas Harriot. 

There is no firm evidence that all of these men were known to each other, but speculation about their connections features prominently in some writing about the Elizabethan era.

==Name==

Raleigh was first named as the centre of the &quot;School of Atheism&quot; by the Jesuit priest Robert Persons in 1592. &quot;School of Night&quot;, however, is a modern appellation: the theory that this purported school was a clandestine intellectual coterie was launched by Arthur Acheson on textual grounds, in his &quot;Shakespeare and the Rival Poet&quot; (1903). The new name is a reference to a passage in Act IV, scene 3 of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, in which the King of Navarre says &quot;Black is the badge of hell / The hue of dungeons and the school of night.&quot; Acheson&#x27;s proposal was endorsed by notable editors John Dover Wilson and Arthur Quiller Couch in their 1923 edition of &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;. There are, however, at least two other recorded renderings of the line, one reading &quot;suit of night&quot; and the other as &quot;scowl of night&quot;.

The context of the lines has nothing to do with cabals: the King is simply mocking the black hair of Rosaline, his friend Berowne&#x27;s lover. John Kerrigan explains that the line is perfectly straightforward as it stands, a riposte to Berowne&#x27;s praise of his dark-haired mistress as &quot;fair&quot;, and any attempts to load it with topical significance are misleading; the simple meaning of &quot;black is the school where night learns to be black&quot; is all that is required. 

In 1936 Frances Yates found an unpublished essay on scholarship by the Earl of Northumberland, an associate of Raleigh and supposed member of the movement, and interpreted the earl&#x27;s mockery of the &quot;precious affectations&quot; found among scholars as inspiring the key celibacy theme of the play. The supposition is discounted as fanciful by some, but nonetheless received acceptance by some prominent commentators of the time.

==Atheism==
It is alleged that each of these men studied science, philosophy, and religion, and all were suspected of atheism. Atheism at that time was a charge nearly the equivalent of treason, since the English monarch after Henry VIII&#x27;s reforms was the head of the Church of England, and to be against the church was, &quot;ipso facto,&quot; to be against the monarch. However, it was also a name for anarchy, and was a charge frequently brought against the politically troublesome. Richard Baines, an anti-Catholic spy for her Majesty&#x27;s Privy Council, whose &quot;task was presumably to provide his masters with what they required&quot;, charged in an unsworn deposition that he had heard from another that Marlowe had &quot;read the Atheist lecture to Sr. Walter Raleigh [and] others&quot;. This tale of hearsay, from a paid informer, failed to substantiate the charges of atheism against the group, but it did include a promise of more evidence to be revealed at a later date.

==In culture==
Since the early 1990s (by which point the School of Night hypothesis had fallen out of mainstream academic favour), the School of Night has frequently been represented in fiction.

A play titled &quot;The School of Night&quot;, by Peter Whelan, dealing with the relationship between Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, was presented by the Royal Shakespeare Company at The Other Place theatre in November 1992. The School of Night also figures prominently in novels: &quot;The Scholars of Night&quot; (1988) by John M. Ford, a Cold War thriller involving an undiscovered Christopher Marlowe play; &quot;A Dead Man in Deptford&quot; (1993) by Anthony Burgess; &quot;Veronica&quot; (1996) by Nicholas Christopher; &quot;School of the Night&quot; (2000) by Judith Cook; &quot;The School of Night&quot; (2001) by Alan Wall, a story of a present-day researcher who becomes obsessed by connections between Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and members of the &quot;school&quot;; &quot;The School of Night&quot; (2010) by Louis Bayard; and &quot;Shadow of Night&quot; (2012) by Deborah Harkness.

The School of Night is also the name of a group of actors and improvisers inspired by the original group and brought together under the auspices of the celebrated theatrical maverick Ken Campbell. The idea is that this group of poets, playwrights, scientists and thinkers might have collectively written the plays attributed to the Bard. The modern-day School of Night shows feature improvisation in the style of poets and playwrights suggested by the audience, and generally includes the creation (or in the jargon of the show &#x27;channeling&#x27;) of a lost Shakespearean masterpiece.

In October 2023, Karl Ove Knausgård released a book called &quot;Nattskolen&quot; (directly translated &quot;The school of night&quot;) in which Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Faustus&quot; plays a prominent role.

<text>Bettina Catherine Welch (1922 – 5 March 1993) was a New Zealand-born Australia-based actress, primarily in radio and theatre and of the latter in television roles. She was best known for her role in television soap opera &quot;Number 96&quot; as Maggie Cameron, a scheming businesswoman and fashion editor.

The series creator and writer David Sale, stated she was the first major bitch on television, long before Alexis Carrington (Joan Collins)

==Early life and training==

Welch was born Auckland, New Zealand. Welch started her acting career aged 18 in 1940 when she arrived in Sydney from New Zealand with her parents on holiday. In Sydney she won a competition that led to her being trained by J. C. Williamson&#x27;s theatre company, and she also began acting on Australian radio. Her training with J. C. Williamson led to a succession of theatre roles with the company. She married Dermot Patrick O&#x27;Brien on 20 February 1945 at St Canice&#x27;s Catholic Church, Rushcutters Bay, New South Wales.

==Theatre career==

When British actor Robert Morley conducted an Australian theatre tour in 1949 she played his young mistress in his co-scripted play &quot;Edward, My Son&quot;. 
Her other stage roles include Australian productions of &quot;Harvey&quot; with Joe E. Brown, &quot;Simon and Laura&quot; and &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; with Googie Withers and John McCallum, the lead role opposite Emrys Jones in &quot;Double Image&quot;, and a featured role with Sir Robert Helpmann in &quot;Nude with Violin&quot; by Noël Coward. 
Welch appeared as the enchantress Morgan le Fey in J. C. Williamson&#x27;s production of &quot;Camelot&quot; in the early 1960s, a role she played for two and a half years. She subsequently took one of the lead roles in four-handed comedy &quot;Any Wednesday&quot;, appeared in productions of &quot;There&#x27;s A Girl In My Soup&quot;, and &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;. The nurse in &quot;Loot&quot;, by Joe Orton featured in &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot;, playing Julia by Edward Albee and took the lead role in a production of Frederick Knott&#x27;s &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot;, a role for which she was critically acclaimed. 
Welch played in Melbourne and Sydney in Hal Porter&#x27;s Australian play &quot;Eden House&quot;. She had a major role in the Sydney Theatre Company&#x27;s season of the Stephen Sondheim musical, A Little Night Music&quot; at the Sydney Opera House in 1990.

==Television roles==

Through the 1960s she also had guest roles in Australian television drama series. In the late 1960s she appeared in the Crawford Productions adventure series &quot;Hunter&quot; (1967), and played various guest roles in the top-rated Crawford Productions police dramas &quot;Homicide&quot; and &quot;Division 4&quot;.

In 1971 Welch appeared in an episode of popular situation comedy series &quot;The Group&quot;. After that show&#x27;s writer David Sale, who had earlier been impressed by the performance she gave in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation-Artransa Films science fiction children&#x27;s series &quot;Phoenix 5&quot; (1970), saw her in the relatively minor role in &quot;The Group&quot;, he promised to write something especially for her next time. When he created &quot;Number 96&quot; he kept his word, creating the role of corrupt businesswoman and fashion editor Maggie Cameron for her.

==&quot;Number 96&quot;==

Appearing in &quot;Number 96&quot; from its inception in March 1972, Welch&#x27;s character Maggie emerged as a popular bitch-figure in the top-rated serial.

Welch says she partly based her characterisation of Maggie on the Mrs Robinson character played by Anne Bancroft in feature film &quot;The Graduate&quot;.

In 1973 Welch left &quot;Number 96&quot; temporarily to again act on stage opposite Robert Morley, this time in &quot;How the Other Half Loves&quot;. She returned to the series after that, and also reprised the role in the feature film version of &quot;Number 96&quot; released in 1974.

In 1975 &quot;Number 96&quot; suffered a drop in ratings so a bomb storyline was developed as a dramatic way to write out several characters. The story went to air in September, and Maggie was revealed to have been the person who planted the bomb and her character written out the series by being sent to prison. Welch returned for a guest appearance in 1976 when Maggie&#x27;s trial was shown, and she appeared in the show&#x27;s final episode in 1977 where it was explained that Maggie had been released from prison.

==Other television roles==

After &quot;Number 96&quot; Welch continued to make guest appearances in Australian television series, including roles in &quot;Glenview High&quot; (1977), &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1977), &quot;Young Ramsay&quot; (1978), and in legal drama &quot;Case for the Defence&quot; (1978). Through the 1980s Welch played small featured roles in several Australian television movies and feature films, including &quot;Undercover&quot; (1983), and guest starred in two episodes of &quot;A Country Practice&quot;. She died in 1993 in Australia, aged 71.

<doc id="245077" wikidata="Q218451" url="?curid=245077" title="Zoilus">
<text>Zoilus ( &quot;Zoilos&quot;; c. 400320 BC) was a Greek grammarian and literary critic from Amphipolis in Eastern Macedonia, then known as Thrace. He took the name Homeromastix (Ὁμηρομάστιξ &quot;Homer whipper&quot;; &quot;gen&quot;.: Ὁμηρομάστιγος) later in life.

==Biography==
According to Vitruvius (vii., preface), Zoilus lived during the age of Ptolemy Philadelphus, by whom he was crucified as the punishment of his criticisms on the king; but this account should probably be rejected as a fiction based on Zoilus&#x27; reputation. Vitruvius goes on to state that Zoilus also may have been stoned at Chios or thrown alive upon a funeral pyre at Smyrna. Either way Vitruvius felt it was just as well since he deserved to be dead for slandering an author who could not defend himself. Zoilus appears to have been at one time a follower of Isocrates, but subsequently a pupil of Polycrates, whom he heard at Athens, where he was a teacher of rhetoric.

Zoilus was chiefly known for the acerbity of his attacks on Homer, chiefly directed against the fabulous element in the Homeric poems. Zoilus also wrote responses to works by Isocrates and Plato, who had attacked the style of Lysias of which he approved.

However, the Homeric Question led to his name becoming a byword for harsh and malignant criticism: in antiquity he gained the name &quot;Homeromastix&quot;, &quot;scourge of Homer&quot;; in the modern period, Cervantes calls Zoilus a &quot;slanderer&quot; in the preface to &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and there is also a (now disused) proverb, &quot;Every poet has his Zoilus.&quot; Since his writings do not survive, it is impossible to know whether this caricature is justified.

<text>Cao Pi () (late 187 – 29 June 226), courtesy name Zihuan, was the first emperor of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period of China. He was the second son of Cao Cao, a warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty, but the eldest son among all the children born to Cao Cao by his concubine (later wife), Lady Bian. According to some historical records, he was often in the presence of court officials in order to gain their support. He was mostly in charge of defence at the start of his career. After the defeat of Cao Cao&#x27;s rival Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, he took Yuan Xi&#x27;s wife, Lady Zhen, as a concubine, but in 221 Lady Zhen died and Guo Nüwang became empress.

On 25 November 220, Cao Pi forced Emperor Xian, the last ruler of the Eastern Han dynasty, to abdicate in his favour, after which on 11 December 220 he proclaimed himself emperor and established the state of Cao Wei. Cao Pi continued the wars against the states of Shu Han and Eastern Wu, founded by his father&#x27;s rivals Liu Bei and Sun Quan respectively, but did not make significant territorial gain in the battles. Unlike his father, Cao Pi concentrated most of his efforts on internal administration rather than on waging wars against his rivals. During his reign, he formally established Chen Qun&#x27;s nine-rank system as the base for civil service nomination, which drew many talents into his government. On the other hand, he drastically reduced the power of princes, stripping off their power to oppose him, but at the same time, rendering them unable to assist the emperor if a crisis arose within the state. After Cao Pi&#x27;s death, his successor Cao Rui granted him the posthumous name &quot;Emperor Wen&quot; and the temple name &quot;Gaozu&quot;.

Cao Pi was also an accomplished poet and scholar, just like his father Cao Cao and his younger brother Cao Zhi. He wrote &quot;Yan Ge Xing&quot; (), the first Chinese poem in the style of seven syllables per line (). He also wrote over a hundred articles on various subjects.

==Early life and career==
Cao Pi was the eldest son of Cao Cao and his concubine Lady Bian, but he was the second among all of Cao Cao&#x27;s sons, the eldest being Cao Ang. At the time of Cao Pi&#x27;s birth, Cao Cao was a mid-level officer in the imperial guards in the capital Luoyang, with no hint that he would go on to the great campaigns he eventually carried out after the collapse of the imperial government in 190. Cao Pi was recorded as excellent swordsman as he studied martial arts from Shi E, a gentleman of the household from the &quot;Rapid as Tigers&quot; () division of the imperial guards. In the period after 190 when Cao Cao was constantly waging war against other rival warlords, it is not known where Cao Pi and Lady Bian were, or what they did. The lone reference to Cao Pi during this period was in 204. After Cao Cao defeated Yuan Shang then conquered the city of Ye and massacred his population. The women of the Yuan household were often raped while Cao Pi took Yuan Xi&#x27;s wife Lady Zhen as his wife.

==Succession struggle with Cao Zhi==
The next immediate reference to Cao Pi&#x27;s activities was in 211, when he was appointed General of the Household for All Purposes () and Vice Imperial Chancellor (). This position placed him second to his father, who was then Imperial Chancellor () and the &quot;de facto&quot; head of government in China. The eldest of all of Cao Cao&#x27;s sons, Cao Ang, had died early, so Cao Pi was regarded as the eldest among all his father&#x27;s sons. Besides, Cao Pi&#x27;s mother had also become Cao Cao&#x27;s official spouse after Cao Cao&#x27;s first wife Lady Ding was deposed. Cao Pi thus became the presumptive heir to his father.

However, Cao Pi&#x27;s status as heir was not immediately made legal, and for years there were lingering doubts on whom Cao Cao intended to make heir. Cao Cao greatly favoured Cao Zhi (his third son with Lady Bian), who was known for his literary talents. Both Cao Pi and Cao Zhi were talented poets, but Cao Zhi was more highly regarded as a poet and speaker. By 215, the brothers appeared to be in harmony with each other, but each had his own group of supporters and close associates engaging the other side in clandestine rivalry. Initially, Cao Zhi&#x27;s party appeared to be prevailing, and in 216 they were successful in falsely accusing two officials supporting Cao Pi – Cui Yan and Mao Jie. Cui Yan was executed, while Mao Jie was deposed. However, the situation shifted after Cao Cao received advice from his strategist Jia Xu, who concluded that changing the general rules of succession (primogeniture) would be disruptive – using Yuan Shao and Liu Biao as negative examples. Cao Pi was also fostering his image among the people and created the sense that Cao Zhi was wasteful and lacking actual talent in governance. In November or December 217, Cao Cao, who had received the title of a vassal king – King of Wei () – from Emperor Xian (whom he still paid nominal allegiance to), finally declared Cao Pi as his heir apparent (). Cao Pi would remain as such until his father&#x27;s death in March 220.

==As King of Wei==
Cao Cao died in the spring of 220 in Luoyang. Even though Cao Pi had been his father&#x27;s heir apparent for several years, there was initially some confusion as to what would happen next. The apprehension was particularly heightened when, after Cao Cao&#x27;s death, the Qingzhou Corps under the general Zang Ba suddenly deserted, leaving Luoyang and returning home. Besides, Cao Pi&#x27;s younger brother Cao Zhang (also born to Lady Bian) had arrived in Luoyang in a hurry, resulting in rumours that he was intending to seize power from his elder brother. Upon hearing these news at Cao Cao&#x27;s headquarters at Ye, Cao Pi hastily declared himself the new King of Wei and issued an edict in the name of his mother Queen Dowager Bian, before receiving an official confirmation from Emperor Xian, to whom he still nominally paid allegiance. After Cao Pi&#x27;s self-declaration, neither Cao Zhang nor any other individual took action against him. Cao Pi then ordered his brothers, including Cao Zhang and Cao Zhi, to return to their respective fiefs. With the help of Jiang Ji, the political situation soon stabilised.

==As emperor of Cao Wei==

===Succeeding Emperor Xian===

In the winter of 220, Cao Pi made his move for the imperial throne, strongly suggesting to Emperor Xian that he should yield the throne. Emperor Xian did so, and Cao Pi formally declined three times (a model that would be followed by future usurpers in Chinese history), and then finally accepted on 25 November of that year, establishing the state of Cao Wei. This event marked the official end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period. The dethroned Emperor Xian was granted the title &quot;Duke of Shanyang&quot; (). Cao Pi granted posthumous titles of emperors to his grandfather Cao Song and his father Cao Cao, while his mother Queen Dowager Bian became empress dowager. He also moved the imperial capital from Xuchang to Luoyang.

===Military failures against Sun Quan===

After news of Cao Pi&#x27;s ascension (and an accompanying false rumour that Cao Pi had executed Emperor Xian) arrived in Liu Bei&#x27;s domain of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), Liu Bei also declared himself emperor in May 221, establishing the state of Shu Han. Sun Quan, who controlled the vast majority of southeastern and southern China, did not take any affirmative steps one way or another, leaving his options open.

An armed conflict between Liu Bei and Sun Quan quickly materialised, because in late 219 Sun Quan had sent his general Lü Meng to invade Jing Province and seize the territories from Liu Bei, which resulted in the death of Liu&#x27;s general Guan Yu. To avoid having to fight on two fronts, Sun Quan formally paid allegiance to Cao Pi, expressing his willingness to become a vassal under Wei. Cao Pi&#x27;s strategist Liu Ye suggested rejecting this offer and instead attacking Sun Quan on a second front. This would effectively partition Sun Quan&#x27;s domain with Shu, and would eventually allow Cao Pi to destroy Shu as well. Cao Pi declined this suggestion, in a fateful choice that most historians believe doomed his empire to ruling only northern and central China; such an opportunity would not come again. Indeed, against Liu Ye&#x27;s advice, Cao Pi granted Sun Quan the title &quot;King of Wu&quot; () and the nine bestowments.

Sun Quan&#x27;s submission did not last long. After Sun Quan&#x27;s forces, under the command of Lu Xun, defeated Shu forces at the Battle of Xiaoting in 222, Sun Quan began to distance himself from Wei. When Cao Pi demanded that Sun Quan send his heir apparent, Sun Deng, to Luoyang as a hostage, Sun Quan refused and formally broke ties with Wei. Cao Pi personally led an expedition against Sun Quan, and in response, Sun Quan declared independence from Wei, establishing the state of Eastern Wu (but he continued ruling as &quot;King of Wu&quot; and did not declare himself emperor until 229). By this time, having defeated Shu, the Wu forces enjoyed high morale and effective leadership from Sun Quan, Lu Xun and a number of other capable generals. Cao Pi&#x27;s forces were not able to make significant advances against them despite several large-scale attacks in the next few years. The division of the former Han Empire into three states has become firmly established, particularly after Liu Bei&#x27;s death in 223. The Shu chancellor Zhuge Liang, serving as regent for Liu Bei&#x27;s son and successor Liu Shan, re-established the alliance with Wu, resulting in Wei having to defend itself on two fronts and unable to conquer either. Exasperated, Cao Pi made a famous comment in 225 that &quot;Heaven created the Yangtze River to divide the north and the south.&quot;

===Domestic matters===
Cao Pi was generally viewed as a competent, but unspectacular, administrator of his empire. He commissioned a number of capable officials to be in charge of various affairs of the empire, employing his father&#x27;s general guidelines of valuing abilities over heritage. However, he was not open to criticism, and officials who dared to criticise him were often demoted and, on rare occasions, put to death.

====Treatment of princes====
Since Cao Pi was still fearful and resentful of Cao Zhi, he soon had the latter&#x27;s fief reduced in size and had a number of his associates executed. Ding Yi, who was chief among Cao Zhi&#x27;s strategists, had his whole clan exterminated as a result of assisting the latter in the past. In summary, under regulations established by Cao Pi, not only were the Wei princes (unlike princes of the Han dynasty) distanced from central politics, they also had minimal authority even in their own principalities and were restricted in many ways, particularly in the use of military force.

====Treatment of officials====
Cao Pi was recorded to frequently ridicule his subordinates. For example, Yu Jin was captured by Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu at the Battle of Fancheng in 219, and was later taken back to Wu and detained there after the Wu invasion of Jing Province. Yu Jin was allowed to return to Wei after Wu briefly became a vassal state under Wei in 221. Cao Pi reinstated Yu Jin as General Who Pacifies the Borders () and announced that he would send Yu Jin back to Eastern Wu – where he had been imprisoned – as an envoy. However, before Yu Jin&#x27;s departure, he was instructed to travel to Ye to pay his respects at Cao Cao&#x27;s tomb. When Yu Jin arrived, he found that the emperor had commissioned artists to paint, in his father&#x27;s tomb, scenes of the Battle of Fancheng. These scenes showed Yu Jin begging for his life to be spared and succumbing to the victorious Guan Yu, while his subordinate Pang De was shown dying an honourable death by resisting the invading forces to his last breath. Upon seeing the vivid mural, Yu Jin was so filled with regret and shame that he fell ill and soon died. Cao Pi further gave the deceased Yu Jin a negative-sounding posthumous title, &quot;Marquis Li&quot; (), for people to remember the latter as the &quot;stony marquis (or vicious marquis)&quot;. Wang Zhong, a general who followed Cao Cao for many years, was also a subject of ridicule by Cao Pi.

===Succession issues and death===
An immediate issue after Cao Pi became emperor in 220 was who the empress would be. Lady Zhen was his wife. Cao Pi summoned Lady Zhen to Luoyang, but Lady Zhen refused because of her poor health. In August 221, Lady Zhen died and the position of empress went to Guo Nüwang.

Guo Nüwang did not bear Cao Pi any children. Cao Rui was the eldest of Cao Pi&#x27;s sons, but because of his mother&#x27;s death, he was not instated as the crown prince. Instead, Cao Rui was appointed &quot;Prince of Pingyuan&quot; after his father&#x27;s ascension to the throne. Cao Pi did not appear to have seriously considered any other son as heir. (It might have been because the other sons were all significantly younger, although their ages were not recorded in history.) In the summer of 226, when Cao Pi was seriously ill, he finally named Cao Rui as his crown prince. On his deathbed, he entrusted Cao Rui to the care of Cao Zhen, Chen Qun and Sima Yi. Following his father&#x27;s death, Cao Rui ascended the throne at the age of 21.

<doc id="245084" wikidata="Q1286003" url="?curid=245084" title="Edmund Beaufort (died 1471)">
<text>Edmund Beaufort (c. 1438 – 6 May 1471), styled 4th [[Duke of Somerset]], 6th Earl of Somerset, 3rd Marquess of Dorset, 3rd Earl of Dorset, was an English nobleman, and a military commander during the Wars of the Roses, in which he supported the Lancastrian king Henry VI.

==Life==

Edmund Beaufort, born about 1438, was the second son of Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset by his wife Eleanor de Beauchamp, a daughter of Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick and widow of Thomas de Roos, 14th Baron Roos of Hamlake. His elder brother was Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset (26 January 1436 – 15 May 1464).

After the defeat of the Lancastrians in 1461, Edmund was brought up in France with his younger brother John Beaufort, Marquess of Dorset, and on the execution of his elder brother Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset after the Battle of Hexham in 1464, Edmund is said to have succeeded as 4th Duke of Somerset by Lancastrians in February 1471, though his brother&#x27;s attainder was never reversed, and his titles remained forfeit. In a proclamation dated 27 April 1471 Edmund is spoken of as &quot;Edmund Beaufort, calling himself duke of Somerset&quot;.

In October 1470 Beaufort returned from France when King Edward IV was driven from the throne after Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick&#x27;s defection and alliance with Queen Margaret and the restoration of King Henry VI, who was the first monarch ousted by the family feud, and whom due to occasional insanity she assisted in his duties, Somerset was unenthusiastic over the reconciliation and made little effort to co-operate. In fact his failure to hold London against Edward IV was a decisive moment, leading to the Battle of Barnet (14 April 1471) and the death of Warwick. Some sources say he was present at Barnet, but this is an error.

Fleeing west towards Wales to seek help from Jasper Tudor, but halted by the Yorkist army at the Battle of Tewkesbury (4 May 1471), he commanded the van of the Lancastrian army at the battle. His position was almost unassailable, but under the pressure of Edward&#x27;s Flemish handgunners, once the battle began Beaufort moved down from the heights and attacked Edward IV&#x27;s right flank. He was assailed by both the king and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and was soon put to flight, his conduct having practically decided the battle in favour of the Yorkists.

After the defeat, Somerset and other Lancastrian leaders took refuge in Tewkesbury Abbey, but they were forced from sanctuary two days later. They were tried and executed immediately, at the Cross in the centre of Tewkesbury, on Monday 6 May 1471. He was buried on the south side of Tewkesbury Abbey, under an arch. His younger brother John had been killed during the battle, and as both died unmarried, &quot;the house of Beaufort and all the honours to which they were entitled became extinct&quot;.

The murder shortly thereafter of Henry VI left Edmund&#x27;s 1st cousin, Lady Margaret Beaufort, and her son, Henry Tudor, as the senior representatives of the House of Lancaster.

<doc id="245085" wikidata="Q1973223" url="?curid=245085" title="The Young Doctors">
<text>The Young Doctors is an Australian early-evening soap opera originally broadcast on the Nine Network and produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation, it aired from Monday 8 November 1976 until Wednesday 30 March 1983. The series is primarily set in the fictional &quot;Albert Memorial Hospital&quot;, as well as the restaurant/nightclub &quot;Bunny&#x27;s Place&quot;, and is fundamentally concerned with the romances and relations between younger members of the hospital staff, rather than typical medical issues and procedures.

The program was shown and exported internationally including throughout North America and Canada and Europe including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France and Spain.

==Series history==
===Early years===
The series produced by the Grundy Organisation was created and devised by Alan Coleman with Reg Watson acting as Executive Producer.

Watson had been the Producer of the British TV soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot; from 1964 to 1973 and he moved back to Australia to help set up a new drama department within the Reg Grundy Organisation, which at the time, was better known for its game and quiz shows. With Coleman producing, as well as Watson&#x27;s experience of making fast-turnaround, five-days a week serial drama, &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; became the third soap opera produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation following the Seven Network&#x27;s serials &quot;Class of 74 / 75&quot;, and &quot;Until Tomorrow&quot;, which screened briefly in 1975.

&quot;The Young Doctors&quot; began in November 1976, a week earlier than another new soap opera on Network Nine, &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, which was produced by Crawford Productions. The Nine Network made it clear only one of the series would be commissioned beyond the initial 13-week production run (approximately 65 episodes).

&quot;The Sullivans&quot;, which had a three times greater budget, after the trial period emerged as the critical success, so &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; was cancelled.

Fans however lobbied the Nine Network, who then reversed their decision and by popular demand &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; continued in its daily 6.00 pm slot and had a successful run of six and a half years, making it one of Australia&#x27;s longest running and popular serials of the time.

===Later years===
The Young Doctors long-serving cast members began to leave, so during the final season in 1982–83, many new characters were added in an attempt to modernise and refresh the long-running serial.

Producer and co-creator Alan Coleman also left in early 1982, and was replaced by Sue Masters twelve months before the series finished production in late November 1982. Masters went on to produce Grundy&#x27;s replacement medical soap, &quot;Starting Out&quot;, for Nine, and then Grundy&#x27;s stablemate, &quot;Prisoner&quot;, from 1983.

Several cast members after the series ended production went on to have leading roles in cult series &quot;Prisoner&quot; including Judy McBurney, Genevieve Lemon, Babs McMillan, Tottie Goldsmith and Peter Bensley.

The loss of several popular cast members had contributed to a sharp decline in ratings, and as a consequence of this, the series was cancelled in late 1982. 
The advent of one-day cricket had led to the Nine Network moving the show around the schedules, particularly in Sydney where it was first moved to 5pm weekdays and, after its cancellation was announced, broadcasts were reduced to a weekly hour-long episode late on Saturday afternoons from November 1982.

When the series ended after 1397 episodes, it held the record of Australia&#x27;s longest-running commercial television drama serial. This was later surpassed by &quot;A Country Practice&quot; and then &quot;Neighbours&quot;, which is currently the longest-running Australian drama serial. &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; also holds the distinction, rare among long-running Australian dramas, of having never won any sort of television award.

&quot;The Young Doctors&quot; final episode aired on 30 March 1983 at 18:00 in Melbourne and on 15 October 1983 at 17:30 in Sydney.

==Stories and settings==
===Albert Memorial Hospital===
Despite the hospital setting, medical procedures rarely featured in storylines, with the majority of the stories and plots focusing more on the personal lives, romances and dramas of the staff. All scenes were played out in the various sets forming the Albert Memorial Hospital. A memorial plaque situated on the wall of the studio set of the hospital&#x27;s exterior stated the hospital opened in 1889 and it is also established early in the series that the fictional Albert Memorial is located in a Sydney district, with Sydney generically referred to as &#x27;the City&#x27;.

A &quot;real life&quot; Albert Memorial Hospital, commonly referred to as the A. M. Hospital was located in Wollongong, and commenced operation in 1864, however closed when the Wollongong Hospital opened in 1907.

The most regularly seen set was the large hospital&#x27;s entrance lobby containing a reception desk, refreshments kiosk, a lift and stairs to the upper floors, and swinging double-doors that led into the casualty department. Various wards, offices, theatres and small medicine labs all saw an equal amount of romantic and dramatic action over the years. Alan Coleman revealed on a DVD release of the series that the various &#x27;flats&#x27; used as sets were simply re-dressed with different hospital equipment and furniture giving the Albert Memorial a sense of monotony often associated with clinical, hospital environments.

Later in &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; run, location shooting became more frequent and viewers saw more of the hospital&#x27;s exterior and grounds. Scenes filmed outside the hospital now showed modern, 1960s era buildings, presumably extensions to the original Victorian hospital. Exterior shots were filmed at the real life Royal North Shore Hospital and the former Greenwich Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, which was used for later exterior shots. There was also a Chapel located in the hospital grounds which was filmed on a few occasions, most notably when Julie Holland was shot at the altar on her Wedding day to Dr Russell Edwards. With location shooting so rare, a trip to Melbourne for a travelogue-style Wedding and tour of the city was an extravagant way to celebrate Liz Kennedy&#x27;s marriage to Dr John Forrest in 1981.

===Bunny&#x27;s Place===
There was also a local bar &quot;Bunny&#x27;s Place&quot; which was another venue for the staff to mingle. The bar was originally owned by, and named after, Bunny Howard, played by comedian, Ugly Dave Gray, who was killed off in an early episode. &quot;Bunny&#x27;s Place&quot; was said to be situated on the opposite side of the busy main road to the hospital. After Bunny died, Edna Curtis (Vivienne Benson-Young) ran the bar for a while, until Annemarie Austin (Judi Connelli) took over a year later. Dr Mike Newman (Peter Bensley) later took over the ownership of Bunny&#x27;s. Although the bar&#x27;s exterior was never shown on-screen, its interior regularly featured in many episodes for the duration of the -year series, appearing in both the first and final episodes.

==Cast and characters==
===Early characters===
&quot;The Young Doctors&quot; had a relatively high turnover of young cast playing the doctors and nurses who featured alongside a more stable roster of longer-running elder cast members. The serial also featured many well-known Australian actors appearing in their earliest roles.

===Cultural impact===
Although &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; was obviously low-budget and the limitations of the fast-turnaround production schedule sometimes crept into the programme, it was immensely popular during the late 1970s in Australia. One highlight episode of this period was the Wedding Day of Tania (Judy McBurney) to Tony Garcia (Tony Alvarez) in March 1978. The producers splashed out on an OB unit, and a rare church wedding took place with the wedding photos gracing all of the week&#x27;s TV magazine covers. In a 2006 interview, Judy McBurney, who played Tania, commented; &quot;I thought &quot;Young Doctors&quot; was a beautiful show. I felt it was innocent, sweet, and a good show...and I think that&#x27;s why people remember it&quot;.

One of the programmes most popular doctors was Ben Fielding, played by Eric Oldfield. He was also Male Model of the Year in 1977 and became the second man to appear naked in a centre spread for Cleo magazine whilst appearing in the show. The actor fondly recalls the photo shoot on a reunion documentary available on both the Umbrella and ViaVision DVD releases, where he describes the pictures as &quot;taboo&quot; because &quot;it wasn&#x27;t acceptable back then for men to be taking all their clothes off&quot;. Oldfield also commented that the pictures have since garnered a popular cult following amongst gay men.

Another notable actor, a very young Russell Crowe, appeared in his first acting role in &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;. In an episode originally aired in 1977, appropriately, he played a young boy called Russell.

During the 1970s, a number of actors appearing in the show also had singing careers, preempting a similar fad for &quot;singing soap stars&quot; a decade later with another Grundy soap opera, &quot;Neighbours&quot;. Early episodes featured singers including Jewel Blanch, Mark Hembrow, Bartholomew John, Mark Holden and Judi Connelli. Possibly due to the fast production schedule, and filming six months in advance of transmission dates, contemporary cultural references are rare in &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;, however, in a very early 1977 episode, Sister Gibbs briskly remarks; &quot;...casualty is busier than an ABBA concert today&quot;. The reference to ABBA is likely due to the fact that their 1977 film, &quot;&quot;, was at the same time being produced by Reg Grundy Productions.

Also extremely popular in the United Kingdom, the success of &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; here is notable because it didn&#x27;t air in Britain contemporaneously with Australian broadcasts. Most ITV regions did not start showing it until &quot;after&quot; it had ended in Australia in March 1983. It therefore looked somewhat dated compared with more recent Australian serials that were airing at the same time (namely, &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;), nevertheless, it became so popular, a fan club was formed, which was active for several years well into the 1990s.

===Awards===

Cornelia Frances on the DVD release audio commentary for episode 325 titled, &quot;Classic Cliffhangers&quot;, that she lost out on the Logie Award for Best Actress for two consecutive years to Lorraine Bayly, who played Grace Sullivan in &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, which also beat &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; as Best Drama in 1978, 1979 and 1980.

===Regular cast===
There was consistently a core cast of 16 regular characters in &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;, with all cast members contracted to appear in three out of a block of five episodes each week. Sometimes, a regular character would not be seen on-screen for several weeks and there is an obvious rotation of recurring characters whom came and went as script requirements permitted. More often than not, a departing regular character would simply disappear from the screen, but their presence in the serial would be maintained by regular scripted references to the character being elsewhere in the hospital, or, as Cornelia Frances described it, &quot;stuck in a cupboard for weeks&quot;, but, always off screen.

==International broadcasts==
The relatively long-running serial also achieved modest international cult success, particularly in the United Kingdom, where it was broadcast on the ITV network. It also aired in New Zealand, France and Spain.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, the programme was acquired by 13 of the 14 weekday members of the ITV Network, while Scottish Television never purchased the series although Ulster, Grampian and Border did. Most of the ITV regions screened &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; at their own regional pace, starting in January 1982.
* Central Television pioneered the programme in a Tuesday and Thursday 12:30 slot from Tuesday 19 January 1982, but during the year, moved to Monday and Tuesdays at 15:45, sharing the slot with the then seasonal Scottish soap opera, &quot;Take the High Road&quot;, which had started in 1980. In January 1983, episodes increased to daily at 15:30 until &quot;Sons and Daughters &quot; began in February. These two serials then shared this timeslot for well over four years, with &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; always airing on Mondays and Tuesdays. This continued until September 1987 when a revamp of ITV&#x27;s daytime schedule saw Central return the programme to 12:00 noon, and then 12:35, thus allowing both &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; and &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; to increase to four or five episodes a week in their revised respective slots. Following the end of &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; in December 1988, &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; returned to 15:30 during Christmas week, and usually aired Tuesday to Friday until &quot;Families&quot; began in April 1990, which took the Monday and Tuesday 15:30 slot. &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; was finally moved to 14:50-15:20, Monday to Thursday later in 1990, and finished on Tuesday 18 August 1992, the first ITV region to complete all of the series.
* HTV started the series on Tuesday 4 January 1983 and continued regularly twice weekly. Initially broadcast Mondays and Fridays at 17:15-17:45, it was soon moved to 15:30-16:00 on Mondays and Tuesdays and finished on 18 April 1994.
* Granada Television and Border Television both broadcast daily episodes five days a week from September 1983. From January 1984, this was reduced to three weekly episodes, Wednesday to Friday (new acquisition Sons and Daughters being shown on Monday and Tuesday) where it remained until the Wednesday episode was dropped in October 1989. During the month of August on some years Granada and Border would pause the series for the summer month. Both regions overtook Central for several years, however, they ultimately finished the series after Central on April 2nd 1993 at 15:20.
* Anglia Television started on 3 September 1984, going out Mondays and Tuesdays at 15:30 until 17 April 1990; then changed to Wednesdays and Thursdays from 25 April 1990. It was then moved to Thursdays and Fridays from Friday 6 July 1990 and an additional Wednesday episode returns in January 1991. Then Mondays to Fridays from January 1992 and finally, Thursdays and Fridays at 13:55 until Friday 2 June 1995.
* Thames Television and LWT started screening the series initially at 17:15 on Thursdays and Fridays from 23 June 1983 until 1 September 1984, before switching the series to 15:30 slot, to allow &quot;Blockbusters&quot; the slot. From this point onwards, only Thames broadcast the series. When Carlton Television took over in January 1993, the series was dropped for six months to allow backlog of &quot;Blockbusters&quot; episodes to be aired, &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; returned daily on 7 June 1993 concluding the programme as an 80 minute special from 13:55 on Friday 30 December 1994. 
* Grampian Television started on Monday 14 November 1983, increased to four episodes per week by 1991, and finished on Friday 30 September 1994.
* TVS started on Monday 9 April 1984 broadcasting Mondays and Tuesdays 15:30; In May switched; Mondays to Wednesdays 17:15 for summer 1984; then Thursdays and Fridays 15:30 from early September 1984; then Mondays to Wednesdays from January 1985 until Wednesday 2 September 1987; then Wednesdays and Thursdays at 12:00 noon; then Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays used from 4 January 1988 15.30; then Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 25 April 1990. TVS lost their franchise at the end of 1992 but their successor, Meridian continued to show the series (more information on the timeslot required) and completed the run on 8 July 1993.
* Tyne Tees Television began the series on Monday 1 October 1984 and aired Mondays and Tuesdays 15:30 until 17 April 1990. It was then moved to Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 14:00 from 25 April 1990. From Thursday 3 January 1991 moves to 15:20 Thursdays and Fridays. A Wednesday episode was added from 23 January 1991, and then from January 1992, it is broadcast Mondays to Fridays at 15:20. From Monday 4 January 1993, Tyne Tees and Yorkshire screened the programme daily at 15:20. From January 1994 until the end in December of that year, this changed to Monday – Thursday at 14.50. 
* TSW started the series on 1 April 1985, Monday and Fridays at 17:15 until 8 July, when it was moved to 15.30 slot. On 17 October 1988, the series moves to 12:30 on Mondays and Wednesdays but due to TSW choosing to screen the daily afternoon repeat of &quot;Home and Away&quot; at 15:25 this resulted in the series becoming weekly during 1989/1990 at 13:30 however returned to twice a week by the end of 1990. Westcountry Television took over in 1993, and continued twice a week until early 1994 when it was increased to three times a week until 20 December 1995 when episode 1101 was broadcast. The series was not completed.
* Years after most of the other regions Yorkshire Television started the series in June 1988, going out five times a week at 12:30, reducing to three times a week from January 1989. In September 1989, the series moved to 15:25 daily with the Wednesday episode dropped from October. In April 1990, the series output is further reduced to two episodes a week on Thursdays and Fridays before the resumption of the Wednesday episode in early 1991. During 1992, the series fluctuates between three, four and five episodes a week ending the year on episode 764. In January 1993, they had to skip 215 episodes to enable them to catch up to Tyne Tees, as from January 1993, both regions screened exactly the same material. It aired daily at 15:20, until January 1994 when the Friday episode was dropped until the series ended on Thursday 15 December 1994.
* &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; was also aired on Sky Channel. On Monday 6 February 1989, the first episode was broadcast 17:00–17:30. From 6 July 1989, it was moved to 15.15–15.45 (to make way for &quot;Sky Star Search&quot; which took the 17:00–18:00 slot). 256 episodes were broadcast in these slots. In February 1990, now called Sky One, the channel dropped another Australian soap, &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, from their mid-morning schedule, so from 5 February 1990, &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; rewound back to the first episode (due to almost catching up with some ITV regions, and having overtaken by Yorkshire Television), and it was aired now 10:30-11:00. Sky One eventually cancelled &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; just over two years later, at episode 589, which aired on Friday 29 May 1992.
ITV Ulster commenced the series in 1984, with a very slow broadcasting rate, they hit episode 40 in around 1988! They were still showing episodes in the 300s in 1993. They dropped the series in 1993/4.

* The longest amount of time that passed for an episode to be first shown and its last showing was the first half hour of the pilot. It was first screened by Central on Tuesday 19 January 1982 at 12.30 and eventually aired on YTV nearly six and a half years later on Monday 6 June 1988 at 12.30.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; was aired on TV2. On Monday 22 February 1982, the first episode was broadcast at 5.30pm. From 19 July 1982, it was moved to the 6pm slot. To make way for &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;, the series was moved from 6pm to a &#x27;double episode&#x27; format at 6.30pm on a Tuesday and Wednesday evening from 11 February 1986. It reverted to half hour, weekday episodes in the 5.15pm slot from 4 August until 12 December 1986, and then to double episodes in the 5.05-5.55pm slot from 15 December 1986 until 6 February 1987. From 9 February 1987, the series was moved to TV One and reverted to half hour episodes at 5.15pm. The final episode was broadcast on Wednesday 27 May 1987.

==Remake==
In November 2007, the Nine Network announced plans to remake the series in conjunction with FremantleMedia. Originally, it was set to be broadcast in 2008 but due to script delays, the premiere date had been pushed back to 2009. The remake was set to be named &quot;Young Doctors&quot; (minus &quot;The&quot;). However, at the end of 2008, the Nine Network officially passed on the idea. The network decided against the remake, instead, confirming a second series of the popular Australian drama Underbelly. FremantleMedia is currently searching for another television station to contract the programme.

==Home media==
Selected episodes of the serial were released on DVD in October 2006, under the title of The Best Romances. A second set of selected episodes, under the title of Classic Cliffhangers, was released in February 2008. In 1994, prior to the DVDs, a VHS was edited in the UK by &quot;NTV entertainment&quot; collecting episodes A, B (pilots) &amp; 1.

On 16 June 2021, ViaVision Entertainment released the first 250 episodes of the series in a 35 disc set which consisted of all episodes screened in 1976 and 1977.

<doc id="245086" wikidata="Q559727" url="?curid=245086" title="Huang Gai">
<text>Huang Gai () ( 180s–210s), courtesy name Gongfu, was a military general who served under the warlord Sun Quan during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He previously served under Sun Quan&#x27;s predecessors – Sun Jian (Sun Quan&#x27;s father) and Sun Ce (Sun Quan&#x27;s elder brother).

==Early life==
Huang Gai was from Quanling County (), Lingling Commandery (), which is present-day Lingling District, Yongzhou, Hunan. He was a descendant of Huang Zilian (), a former Administrator of Nanyang Commandery. Huang Gai&#x27;s grandfather moved from Nanyang to Lingling and had remained there since. Huang Gai was orphaned at a young age and he experienced hardships in his early days. However, he had high ambitions and, despite being poor, he worked hard and read books and studied military arts on his own.

==Early career and service under Sun Jian and Sun Ce==
Huang Gai later became a minor official in the local commandery office before he was nominated as a &quot;xiaolian&quot; and employed as an assistant in the office of one of the Three Ducal Ministers. Around the 180s, when the warlord Sun Jian was raising a militia to help government forces suppress the Yellow Turban Rebellion, Huang Gai responded to the call and became one of Sun Jian&#x27;s subordinates. Huang Gai accompanied Sun Jian in attacking bandits in the region and also participated in the campaign against Dong Zhuo under Sun Jian&#x27;s banner. Huang Gai was later appointed as a Major of Separate Command (). After Sun Jian&#x27;s death in 191, Huang Gai continued to serve under Sun Jian&#x27;s eldest son, Sun Ce, and later under Sun Quan, Sun Ce&#x27;s younger brother. He was involved in Sun Ce&#x27;s conquests in the Jiangdong region.

==Service under Sun Quan==
===Maintaining peace and stability within Wu===
When Sun Quan was in control of the Wu territories, the lands were not very peaceful as the Shanyue tribes in the region often raided counties and caused much trouble. Huang Gai was sent to pacify the Shanyue. Once, Huang Gai was assigned to oversee Shicheng County and he knew that the local officials did not follow the laws and were difficult to control. After entering the county office, he chose two officers to be his assistants and ordered them to manage the office. He also gave instructions for all the officers to abide by rules and regulations and perform their duties well. The two officers were afraid of Huang Gai so they put in full effort in their work. However, as time passed, they realised that Huang Gai did not inspect their work, so they became lax and reverted to their old ways. Huang Gai was actually aware of what was going on. He invited all the local officials to attend a banquet later and exposed the two officers&#x27; misdeeds in front of everyone. The officers were frightened and started begging for their lives, but Huang Gai still executed them. This incident shocked everyone in the county. Huang Gai was later reassigned to be the Chief of Chungu County (春穀縣; northwest of present-day Fanchang County, Anhui) and the Prefect of Xunyang County (尋陽縣; southwest of present-day Huangmei County, Hubei). The nine counties under his governorship were peaceful and stable. Huang Gai was subsequently promoted to Commandant of Danyang Commandery (丹楊郡; around present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu). He helped the poor and earned the respect of the Shanyue.

===Battle of Red Cliffs===
In the winter of 208–209, Huang Gai fought in the Battle of Red Cliffs against Cao Cao&#x27;s forces. He was a subordinate of Zhou Yu, who was the frontline commander of Sun Quan&#x27;s forces in that battle. Huang Gai told Zhou Yu: &quot;The enemy are superior in numbers in comparison with our side. I fear that we cannot last long. However, I observe that Cao Cao&#x27;s ships are linked to each other. We can destroy them by fire.&quot; Huang Gai then prepared about ten &quot;mengchong&quot;s and &quot;doujian&quot;s (鬬艦; a type of warship) and filled them with the ingredients necessary for starting a fire. He then wrote a letter to Cao Cao, pretending that he wanted to surrender and defect to Cao Cao&#x27;s side. Cao Cao told Huang Gai&#x27;s messenger: &quot;I only fear that this is a trick. However, if what Huang Gai said is true, I will reward him handsomely.&quot;

Huang Gai also prepared some &quot;zouge&quot;s (走舸; a smaller type of boat), which would follow behind the &quot;mengchong&quot;s and &quot;doujian&quot;s, and his small fleet sailed towards Cao Cao&#x27;s base. The wind was blowing strongly from the southeast. When Huang Gai&#x27;s fleet reached the middle of the river, the ships all raised their sails, and Huang Gai lifted a torch and instructed his men to shout &quot;We surrender!&quot; Cao Cao&#x27;s troops came out of the camp to look and they said Huang Gai was coming to join them. When Huang Gai was about 20 &quot;li&quot; away from the enemy base, he ordered his men to set the ships on fire and they boarded the smaller boats behind. As the wind was very strong, the flaming ships sailed towards Cao Cao&#x27;s warships at fast speed and caused them to catch fire as well. Cao Cao&#x27;s ships were all burnt down and the flames also spread quickly to his camps on land. Zhou Yu then ordered an attack on Cao Cao&#x27;s base and scored a major victory. Cao Cao retreated north with his surviving troops after his defeat.

Huang Gai was hit by a stray arrow during the battle and fell into the river. He was saved by Zhou Yu&#x27;s men, who did not recognise him and left him on a toilet seat. When Han Dang passed by, Huang Gai managed to call out to him. Han Dang recognised Huang Gai&#x27;s voice so he rushed towards him. With tears in his eyes, Han Dang helped Huang Gai remove his clothing so that the wound can be treated, and Huang Gai survived.

===Later career and death===
Huang Gai was promoted to General of the Household of Martial Edge (). When the tribal people in Wuling Commandery (武陵郡; around present-day Changde, Hunan) started a rebellion, Huang Gai was appointed as the Administrator of Wuling and was sent to quell the uprising. At that time, there were only 500 troops in the commandery and they were heavily outnumbered by the rebels. However, Huang Gai ordered the city gates to be opened, and when about half of the rebel army had entered, he launched an assault on them, killing hundreds of enemies while the surviving ones fled. Huang Gai later succeeded in pacifying the rebellion over the following three months by targeting the rebel chiefs and pardoning the rebels who surrendered. By summer, all the tribal chiefs had submitted to Huang Gai. Peace was restored in Wuling.

Later, when Huang Gai received news that Yiyang County was under attack by bandits, he led his forces to fight the bandits and succeeded in restoring peace in the region. Huang Gai was subsequently promoted to Lieutenant-General (). He died in office while serving as the Administrator of Wuling Commandery.

==Huang Bing==
In 229, after Sun Quan declared himself emperor and established the state of Eastern Wu, he granted the title of a Secondary Marquis () to Huang Gai&#x27;s son, Huang Bing (), in recognition of Huang Gai&#x27;s contributions.

==Appraisal==
Huang Gai was described as having a stern and serious appearance, and was known to be a good disciplinarian. Every time he went into battle, the men under him would compete fiercely to earn the top credit. Huang Gai was also known to be just and decisive when he handled cases in court and he never had any lapses. After his death, he was fondly remembered by the people of Wu, and they even created portraits of him and worshipped him.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Huang Gai is a minor character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. He appears mainly in the chapters covering the events leading to the Battle of Red Cliffs. His most significant moment in the novel is a fictional episode in which he proposes a &quot;self-torture ruse&quot; () to win Cao Cao&#x27;s trust so that Zhou Yu&#x27;s fire attack plan can be carried out. Huang Gai has a secret conversation with Zhou Yu one night and suggests his plan. The following morning, when Zhou Yu calls for an assembly of the officers to discuss their battle plans, Huang Gai pretends to openly challenge and insult Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu pretends to be furious and he orders Huang Gai to be executed, but with some intervention from Gan Ning and others, he spares Huang Gai&#x27;s life and has him severely flogged. Huang Gai then writes a letter to Cao Cao, expressing his willingness to defect over to Cao Cao&#x27;s side because he is unhappy with Zhou Yu. Cai Zhong and Cai He, two spies planted by Cao Cao in Zhou Yu&#x27;s camp, confirm Huang Gai&#x27;s account that he was flogged on Zhou Yu&#x27;s order because of an argument. Kan Ze later helps to convince Cao Cao that Huang Gai&#x27;s defection is genuine, even though Cao initially saw through the ruse. Huang Gai then arranges with Cao Cao that on a certain night, he would sail across the river over to Cao&#x27;s camp. That night, Huang Gai uses the opportunity to launch the fire attack, sparking off the Battle of Red Cliffs.

== In popular culture ==
Huang Gai appears as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series.

He is portrayed by Liu Kui in the 2010 Chinese television series &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot;.

<doc id="245089" wikidata="Q1402440" url="?curid=245089" title="Feldenkrais Method">
<text>The Feldenkrais Method (FM) is a type of movement therapy devised by Israeli Moshé Feldenkrais (1904–1984) during the mid-20th century. The method is claimed to reorganize connections between the brain and body and so improve body movement and psychological state.

There is no conclusive evidence for any medical benefits of the therapy. However, researchers do not believe FM poses serious risks.

== Description ==

The Feldenkrais Method is a type of alternative movement therapy that proponents claim can repair impaired connections between the motor cortex and the body, so benefiting the quality of body movement and improving wellbeing. Practitioners view it as a form of somatic education &quot;that integrates the body, mind and psyche through an educational model in which a trained Feldenkrais practitioner guides a client (the ‘student’) through movements with hands-on and verbally administered cues,&quot; according to &quot;Clinical Sports Medicine.&quot;

The Feldenkrais Guild of North America claims that the Feldenkrais method allows people to &quot;rediscover [their] innate capacity for graceful, efficient movement&quot; and that &quot;These improvements will often generalize to enhance functioning in other aspects of [their] life&quot;.
The &quot;Oxford Handbook of Music Performance&quot; describes FM as &quot;an experiential learning process that uses movement and guided attention to develop and refine self-awareness.&quot; It notes that FM is &quot;increasingly used among high-level performers, such as musicians, actors, dancers, and athletes.&quot;

Feldenkrais lessons have two types, one verbally guided and practiced in groups called Awareness Through Movement, and one hands-on and practiced one-to-one called Functional Integration. Moshé Feldenkrais wrote, &quot;The purpose of these sensorimotor lessons is to refine one’s ability to make perceptual distinctions between movements that are easy and pleasurable and those that are strained and uncomfortable, which results in the discovery of new movement possibilities as well as potential for further improvements.&quot;

=== Five principles ===
FM operates broadly within five principles:

# &quot;Learning is a process&quot;: &quot;relies on sensory and kinesthetic information that one experiences through interactions with the environment&quot;
# &quot;Posture as dynamic equilibrium&quot;: &quot;the ability to regain equilibrium after a large disturbance&quot;
# &quot;Exploratory versus performative movement&quot;:&quot; the ability to make distinctions in the ease and quality of movement and to try out movements that may be unfamiliar&quot;
# &quot;Whole versus part learning&quot;: &quot;exploring component parts of an action as well as the whole&quot;
# &quot;Repetition and variation&quot;: &quot;introducing novelty in learning in order to expand possibilities for choice&quot;

==Effectiveness==
In 2015, the Australian Government&#x27;s Department of Health published the results of a review of 17 natural therapies that sought to determine which would continue being covered by health insurance; the Feldenkrais Method was one of 16 therapies for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. Accordingly in 2017 the Australian government identified the Feldenkrais Method as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would &quot;ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence&quot;.

Proponents claim that the Feldenkrais Method can benefit people with a number of medical conditions, including children with autism, and people with multiple sclerosis. However, no studies in which participants were clearly identified as having an autism spectrum disorder or developmental disabilities have been presented to back these claims.

There is limited evidence that workplace-based use of the Feldenkrais Method may help aid rehabilitation of people with upper limb complaints.

A 2022 report on the effectiveness of the Feldenkrais Method by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care found a &quot;hint&quot; of benefit for people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, compared to a passive lecture program. Evidence for helping chronic low back pain was inconsistent. The report found no evidence for &quot;long-term&quot; benefit of FM, or benefit for other conditions. It concluded, &quot;The question about the benefit of the Feldenkrais method in comparison with active strategies such as extensive physiotherapy generally remains open. Overall, little evidence is available. From an ethical perspective, the absence of evidence from RCTs is problematic for informed decision making but does not constitute evidence of an absent benefit. Only 2 small, ongoing RCTs of questionable relevance were identified, and therefore, the availability of evidence is not expected to change in the short term.&quot;

==Criticism==
David Gorski has written that the Method bears similarities to faith healing, is like &quot;glorified yoga&quot;, and that it &quot;borders on quackery&quot;. Quackwatch places the Feldenkrais Method on its list of &quot;Unnaturalistic methods&quot;.

== History ==
From the 1950s till his death in 1984, Feldenkrais taught in his home city of Tel Aviv. He gained recognition in part through media accounts of his work with prominent individuals, including Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion.
In David Kaetz&#x27;s biography, &quot;Making Connections: Roots and Resonance in the Life of Moshe Feldenkrais&quot; (2007), he argues many lines of influence can be found between the Judaism of Feldenkrais&#x27;s upbringing and the Feldenkrais Method – for instance, the use of paradox as a pedagogical tool.

&quot;Making Connections&quot; described Feldenkrais&#x27; approach:
Feldenkrais was critical of the appropriation of the term &#x27;energy&#x27; to express immeasurable phenomena or to label experiences that people had trouble describing ... He was impatient when someone invoked energy in pseudoscientific &#x27;explanations&#x27; that masked a lack of understanding. In such cases he urged skepticism and scientific discourse. He encouraged empirical and phenomenological narratives that could lead to insights.

Beginning in the late 1950s, Feldenkrais made trips to teach in Europe and America. Several hundred people became certified Feldenkrais practitioners through trainings he held in San Francisco from 1975 to 1978 and in Amherst, Massachusetts, from 1980 to 1984.
Cybernetics, also known as dynamic systems theory, continued to influence the Feldenkrais Method in the 1990s through the work of human development researcher Esther Thelen.:1535

<text>Froot Loops is a sweetened, fruit-flavored breakfast cereal made by WK Kellogg Co for the United States, Canadian, and Caribbean markets and Kellanova for the rest of the world. The brand was solely owned by the original Kellogg Company before it spun off its North American cereal division as WK Kellogg Co in late 2023. The fruit-flavored cereal pieces are ring-shaped, with a variety of bright colors. Although appearing in different colors, every color has the same flavor.

== History ==

Kellogg&#x27;s introduced Froot Loops in 1963. Originally, there were only red, orange and yellow loops; green, blue and purple loops were added during the 1990s, with blue being introduced last in 1996.

The loops all share the same fruit-blend flavor. Different production methods are used in the UK, where the company misleadingly suggested that each individual loop color was a different flavor.

== Mascot ==
Toucan Sam has been the mascot of Froot Loops since its first appearance. Toucan Sam is a blue anthropomorphic toucan; the colors of his bill correspond to the three original Froot Loop colors. He is portrayed as having an uncanny ability to smell Froot Loops from great distances and locates a concealed bowl of the cereal while intoning &quot;Follow my nose! It always knows! The flavor of fruit!&quot; or &quot;Follow my nose! For the fruity taste that shows!&quot;

Toucan Sam was first voiced by voice actor Mel Blanc, with an American accent, and later by Maurice LaMarche, with a British accent.

==Varieties==
Kellogg&#x27;s made several varieties of snack foods, including snack bags called Snack Ums. Snack Ums were similar to the cereal but larger. Their slogan was &quot;Super-sized bites with deliciously intense natural fruit flavors&quot; and &quot;Flavor Bursting!&quot; Froot Loops-branding by Kellogg&#x27;s was also used with the Froot Loops cereal bar, and in 2021 Froot Loops Pop-Tarts.

In 2017, a special Unicorn Froot Loops limited edition was released in the United Kingdom.

<text>Lucius Opimius was a Roman politician who held the consulship in 121 BC, in which capacity and year he ordered the execution of 3,000 supporters of popular leader Gaius Gracchus without trial, using as pretext the state of emergency declared after Gracchus&#x27;s recent and turbulent death. He was censured in 116 BC by a tribunal investigating illicit bribes taken from Jugurtha, king of Numidia, by his commission tasked with dividing territory between the king and his brother. He then left Rome to Dyrrhachium in exile where he later died.

== Biography ==
He is first mentioned for crushing the revolt of the town of Fregellae in 125 BC. He was elected consul in 121 BC with Quintus Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus, and while Fabius was campaigning in Gaul, he took part in perhaps the most decisive event of Roman history to that point.

When Gaius Gracchus and M. Fulvius Flaccus were defeated for re-election by Opimius and Fabius, Gracchus organized a mass protest on the Aventine Hill. Alarmed by this action, the Senate passed the motion &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot;, which Opimius understood as an order to suppress their activities by any means necessary—including force. He gathered an armed force of Senators and their supporters, and confronted Gracchus and his followers, an act which quickly became a pitched battle inside the city of Rome. Gracchus, Flaccus, and many of their followers were slain in this conflict, and after clearing the streets of his opponents, Opimius established a &quot;quaestio&quot; or tribunal that condemned to death 3,000 people accused of being supporters of Gracchus.

Opimius was prosecuted for these violent actions in 120 BC, but Carbo won his acquittal. Opimius&#x27; victory established the &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot; in Roman constitutional practice, providing a limitless tool that the various Roman factions used against each other in the following years as the Republic slipped increasingly into violence and civil war.

In 116 BC, Opimius headed a commission that divided Numidia between Jugurtha and his brother Adherbal. Suspecting that the commission had been influenced by bribes from Jugurtha, its members were later investigated by a tribunal that censured their conduct. Humiliated, Opimius went into exile in Dyrrhachium, where he later died.

<doc id="245093" wikidata="Q468743" url="?curid=245093" title="Ma Chao">
<text>Ma Chao () (176–222), courtesy name Mengqi, was a Chinese military general and warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period of China. A descendant of the general Ma Yuan, Ma Chao was the eldest son of Ma Teng, a prominent warlord in Liang Province (covering parts of northwestern China). In 211, he formed a coalition with Han Sui and other northwestern warlords and revolted against the Han central government, which was led by the warlord Cao Cao. The coalition broke up after losing the Battle of Tong Pass against Cao Cao&#x27;s forces. Ma Chao initially retreated, but later returned to attack and seize control of Liang Province by killing the provincial inspector Wei Kang and forcing Wei Kang&#x27;s subordinates to submit to him. About a year after Ma Chao started his uprising, Emperor Xian issued an imperial decree ordering the execution of Ma Chao&#x27;s family members, who were in Ye city at the time. In the meantime, Wei Kang&#x27;s subordinates, led by Zhao Ang, Yang Fu and others, rebelled against Ma Chao and forced him out of Liang Province. Ma Chao retreated to Hanzhong Commandery, where he borrowed troops from the warlord Zhang Lu, and returned to attack Liang Province but was ultimately defeated and driven back. Ma Chao took shelter under Zhang Lu for a while until around 214, when he heard that the warlord Liu Bei was fighting for control over Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) with Yi Province&#x27;s governor, Liu Zhang. He defected to Liu Bei&#x27;s side and assisted Liu Bei in capturing Yi Province from Liu Zhang. Ma Chao had served as a general under Liu Bei since then and participated in the Hanzhong Campaign in 219. He died in 222.

In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Ma Chao is romanticised as a heroic warrior and one of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei. In the novel, the descriptions of his character and personality, as well as the order of some events involving him, have been significantly modified for dramatic effect. For example, in the novel he started the Battle of Tong Pass to take revenge against Cao Cao for murdering his family, but historically he waged war against Cao Cao first, and then his family members were implicated and executed about one year later. In the novel, he also engaged Xu Chu and Zhang Fei in one-on-one duels at the Battle of Tong Pass and Battle of Jiameng Pass respectively, but historically the duels never took place and the Battle of Jiameng Pass is actually a fictional battle.

==Family background==
Ma Chao was from Maoling County (茂陵縣), Youfufeng Commandery (右扶風郡), which is located northeast of present-day Xingping, Shaanxi. He was the eldest son of Ma Teng, who descended from Ma Yuan, a general who lived in the early Eastern Han dynasty. Ma Teng&#x27;s father, Ma Ping (馬平), whose courtesy name was Zishuo (子碩), served as a military officer in Tianshui Commandery (天水郡) during the reign of Emperor Huan. After losing his post, Ma Ping went to live among the Qiang tribes in the region, married a Qiang woman and had a son, Ma Teng. Ma Teng, along with Han Sui and others, were warlords who held considerable influence in Liang Province (covering parts of present-day Shaanxi and Gansu) towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty and were reluctant to submit to Han rule. In 192, Ma Teng accepted the appointment of General Who Attacks the West (征西將軍) from the Han imperial court and garrisoned his army at Mei County (郿縣). However, he rebelled against the Han dynasty later and attacked the city of Chang&#x27;an but failed to conquer it so he retreated back to Liang Province.

==Early career==
During the early &quot;Jian&#x27;an&quot; (建安; 196–220) era, Ma Teng and Han Sui battled against each other. Around age twenty, Ma Chao was famous for his strength and fought on his father&#x27;s side. During a battle, Yan Xing stabbed him with his spear. As the spear broke, he used it to strike Ma Chao&#x27;s neck and nearly killed him. Conflict between Ma Teng and Han Sui ended in 200, when Zhong Yao and Wei Duan (韋端) convinced them to reconcile.

In 197, the warlord Cao Cao – who had become the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Han central government – placed Zhong Yao, the Colonel-Director of Retainers (司隷校尉), in charge of guarding the Guanzhong region. Zhong Yao wrote to Ma Teng and Han Sui, explaining to them the benefits of submitting to the Han court and the negative consequences of not doing so. When Cao Cao became the Imperial Chancellor (丞相), he wanted to recruit Ma Chao to serve in the Han government, but Ma refused.

In 202, when Cao Cao was on a series of campaigns to unify northern China after his victory over Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu two years earlier, he ordered Zhong Yao to attack Yuan&#x27;s allies Gao Gan and Guo Yuan in Pingyang (平陽; in present-day Linfen, Shanxi). Ma Teng sent Ma Chao to assist Zhong Yao. Ma Chao served as an Assistant Officer Who Supervises the Army (督軍從事) under Zhong Yao. During the battle, he was hit by a stray arrow in the foot, but he wrapped his foot in a pouch and continued fighting. His subordinate Pang De slew Guo Yuan and they defeated the enemy.

Ma Teng got into conflict with Han Sui later, so he requested to leave Liang Province and work in the capital. He was granted permission and appointed as the Minister of the Guards (衞尉) by the Han court. Ma Chao was appointed as a Lieutenant-General (偏將軍), made a Marquis of a Chief Village (都亭侯), and placed in charge of his father&#x27;s troops in Liang Province. Ma Chao&#x27;s younger brothers Ma Xiu (馬休) and Ma Tie (馬鐵) were appointed as a Commandant of Equipage (奉車都尉) and a Commandant of Iron Cavalry (鐵騎都尉) respectively, and were ordered to bring all their family members with them to Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei). Only Ma Chao remained behind in Liang Province.

==Uprising against the Cao Cao controlled Han Government==

===Battle of Tong Pass===
In 211, Cao Cao sent Zhong Yao and Xiahou Yuan to lead an army to attack Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. They were due to pass through the Guanzhong region along the way. Ma Chao suspected that Cao Cao was planning to attack him, so he contacted Han Sui to form an alliance. He told Han Sui, &quot;Previously, Zhong Yao ordered me to harm you. Now, I know that the people from Guandong (east of Tong Pass) cannot be trusted. Now, I abandon my father, and I&#x27;m willing to acknowledge you as my father. You should also abandon your son, and treat me like your son.&quot; Han Sui&#x27;s subordinate, Yan Xing, urged his superior not to cooperate with Ma Chao but Han still agreed to the alliance. Ma Chao also contacted Yang Qiu, Li Kan (李堪), Cheng Yi (成宜), Hou Xuan (侯選), Cheng Yin (程銀), Zhang Heng (張橫), Liang Xing (梁興), Ma Wan (馬玩) and others, and they formed a 100,000 strong coalition army to attack Tong Pass (present-day Tongguan County, Shaanxi). Liu Zhang, the governor of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), wanted to marry his daughter to Ma Chao to build ties with Ma, but Wang Shang (王商), a commandery administrator under Liu Zhang, opposed the idea and said that Ma Chao was courageous but inhumane and untrustworthy.

Cao Cao led an army to Tong Pass to attack Ma Chao and the coalition, resulting in the Battle of Tong Pass. After both sides clashed in a few engagements, Cao Cao had talks with Ma Chao and Han Sui. Ma Chao relied on his great strength and secretly harboured the intention of dashing forth and capturing Cao Cao when they met. However, he did not dare to make his move when Xu Chu, one of Cao Cao&#x27;s close aides, glared at him. Cao Cao later followed Jia Xu&#x27;s strategy to sow discord between Ma Chao and Han Sui and make them become suspicious of each other. Taking advantage of the hostility between Ma Chao and Han Sui, Cao Cao launched an attack on the northwestern warlords and defeated them.

Earlier on, when Cao Cao&#x27;s forces were at Puban (蒲阪; east of present-day Dali County, Shaanxi) and were planning to cross the Wei River and head west, Ma Chao told Han Sui, &quot;We should resist them at the north of the Wei River. Within 20 days, their supply stores on the east of the river will be depleted, after which they will definitely retreat.&quot; However, Han Sui rejected his idea and said, &quot;We should send our forces to engage the enemy on the river. Isn&#x27;t this more direct?&quot; When Cao Cao heard of Ma Chao&#x27;s plan, he remarked, &quot;If the young horse doesn&#x27;t die, I can&#x27;t have a proper burial place.&quot;

===Battles in Guanzhong===
Ma Chao retreated further west after his defeat at Tong Pass. Cao Cao pursued him to Anding (安定; around present-day Pingliang, Gansu) but gave up on the pursuit and headed east after receiving news about unrest in northern China. Yang Fu warned Cao Cao, &quot;Ma Chao has the courage of Han Xin and Ying Bu, and both the Qiang and Rong peoples deeply respect him. If we retreat now and don&#x27;t station defences here, we&#x27;ll forfeit all the territories in this area.&quot; After Cao Cao left, as Yang Fu predicted, Ma Chao led the various tribes in the region to attack the commanderies and counties in Guanzhong, while the people responded to his call and joined him in the revolt. Ma Chao killed Wei Kang, the Inspector (刺史) of Liang Province, and seized control of Liang Province&#x27;s capital Jicheng (兾城; in present-day Gangu County, Gansu) and forced Wei Kang&#x27;s subordinates to submit to him. He then appointed himself General Who Attacks the West (征西將軍) and Governor (牧) of Bing Province, and took charge of military affairs in Liang Province.

While Ma Chao besieged Wei Kang, Xiahou Yuan wanted to lead reinforcements to help him but arrived too late as Ji had already fallen to Ma Chao with Xiahou Yuan still more than 200 &quot;li&quot; away from Ji. Ma Chao led an army out to face Xiahou Yuan who would prove unable to defeat Ma Chao and decided to withdraw his troops when he heard that the Di tribes in Qian County () had started a rebellion.

Wei Kang&#x27;s former subordinates – Yang Fu, Jiang Xu, Liang Kuan (梁寬), Zhao Qu (趙衢) and others – were unhappy with Ma Chao so they plotted to get rid of him. Yang Fu and Jiang Xu rebelled against Ma Chao in Lucheng (鹵城; in present-day southeastern Gansu), while the others in Jicheng pretended to urge Ma to suppress the revolt. Ma Chao followed their advice and led an army to attack Lucheng but could not conquer the city. When he returned to Jicheng, he saw that Liang Kuan and Zhao Qu had closed the city gates and barred him from entering. Zhao Qu and the others also killed Ma Chao&#x27;s wife and child(ren) in Jicheng.

In the summer of 212, about a year after Ma Chao rebelled against the Cao Cao controlled Han court, Cao Cao forced Emperor Xian to issue a decree ordering the execution of Ma Chao&#x27;s father Ma Teng and the rest of his family who were with him at the time in Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei).

Ma Chao fled to Hanzhong, where he borrowed troops from the warlord Zhang Lu, and returned to attack those who drove him out of Guanzhong. He besieged Jiang Xu, Zhao Ang and their allies at Mount Qi (祁山; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu) for about 30 days until reinforcements led by Cao Cao&#x27;s generals Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He showed up and lifted the siege.

==Service under Zhang Lu==
Ma Chao returned to Hanzhong Commandery after his defeat at Mount Qi and sought shelter under Zhang Lu. Zhang Lu planned to marry his daughter to Ma Chao, but one of Zhang&#x27;s aides advised him against it, saying, &quot;If a person can&#x27;t even love his family and relatives, can he still love others?&quot; Zhang Lu then aborted his plan.

On one New Year&#x27;s Day, a relative of Ma Chao who had also escaped to Hanzhong came to visit him. Ma Chao beat his chest, coughed blood, and said to his relative, &quot;A big family with over a hundred members all sharing the same fate in one day. Now, are there only the two of us to give greetings to each other?&quot;

Ma Chao constantly asked Zhang Lu to give him some troops to attack Liang Province. Zhang Lu agreed, but Ma Chao failed to make any gains from the campaign. Yang Bai (楊白), an officer under Zhang Lu, was jealous of Ma Chao&#x27;s ability and wanted to harm him. When Ma Chao heard about it, he escaped from Wudu (武都; around present-day Longnan, Gansu) and went to live with the Di people around the area.

==Service under Liu Bei==
Around 214, the warlord Liu Bei was fighting for control over Yi Province with the provincial governor Liu Zhang. Ma Chao distrusted Zhang Lu and felt that he was not capable of great achievements, so he planned to defect to Liu Bei. When he heard that Liu Bei was besieging Liu Zhang in Chengdu (Yi Province&#x27;s capital), he wrote a secret letter to Liu Bei, expressing his desire to serve the latter. Liu Bei was pleased to receive Ma Chao&#x27;s letter and he exclaimed, &quot;Yi Province is mine.&quot; He then sent Li Hui to meet Ma Chao and provide supplies and additional troops to Ma, after which Ma led his forces to the north of Chengdu and joined the siege. When the people of Chengdu saw Ma Chao and his troops below the city walls, they were greatly demoralized and fearful. Within ten days of Ma Chao&#x27;s arrival, Liu Zhang gave up resistance and surrendered to Liu Bei.

After occupying Yi Province, Liu Bei appointed Ma Chao as General Who Pacifies the West (平西將軍) and put him in charge of Linju (臨沮; northeast of present-day Yuan&#x27;an County, Hubei). Liu Bei defeated Cao Cao in the Hanzhong Campaign in 219 and declared himself &quot;King of Hanzhong&quot; (漢中王), after which he appointed Ma Chao as General of the Left (左將軍).

In 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and established the state of Shu Han. He appointed Ma Chao as General of Agile Cavalry (驃騎將軍) and Governor (牧) of Liang Province. Ma Chao was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Tai District (斄鄉侯). Liu Bei&#x27;s imperial edict to Ma Chao was as follows: 

===Peng Yang&#x27;s case===
When Peng Yang, an official under Liu Bei, was about to leave Chengdu to assume his new appointment in Jiangyang, he visited Ma Chao and told him: &quot;You are outside while I am inside. The Empire can be pacified.&quot; Ma Chao had recently joined Liu Bei&#x27;s forces and he was often fearful that he would get into trouble. After hearing what Peng Yang told him, he was shocked as he thought that Peng Yang was asking him to participate in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against Liu Bei. However, he remained silent and did not respond. After Peng Yang left, Ma Chao secretly reported him and caused him to be arrested and executed.

===Conflict with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei===
The &quot;Shanyang Gong Zaiji&quot; (山陽公載記; &quot;Records of the Duke of Shanyang&quot;), by Yue Zi (樂資), recorded an incident as follows: 

Pei Songzhi, who annotated Ma Chao&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, disputed the &quot;Shanyang Gong Zaiji&quot; account as untruthful and nonsensical. He commented as follows: 

==Death==
Ma Chao died in 222 at the age of 47 (by East Asian age reckoning). His cause of death was not recorded in history. Before his death, he wrote to Liu Bei: &quot;Over 200 members of my family were killed by Cao Cao. I only have my cousin Ma Dai left with me. He will be the one to continue my family line. I entrust him to Your Majesty&#x27;s care. That is all I have to say.&quot; In October or November 260, Liu Bei&#x27;s son and successor, Liu Shan, granted Ma Chao the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Wei&quot; (威侯).

==Family and relatives==
Ma Chao&#x27;s title, Marquis of Tai District (斄鄉侯), was inherited by his son, Ma Cheng (馬承). Ma Chao&#x27;s daughter married Liu Bei&#x27;s son Liu Li (劉理), the Prince of Anping (安平王).

Ma Chao had at least two spouses. The first was Lady Yang (楊氏), who was with him when he seized control of Liang Province after the Battle of Tong Pass. She probably bore Ma Chao at least one child, because the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; mentioned that Zhao Qu (趙衢), Yin Feng (尹奉) and others killed Ma&#x27;s family (wife and child(ren)) when they rebelled against him and drove him out of Liang Province. Ma Chao had a second wife, Lady Dong (董氏), who bore him a son, Ma Qiu (馬秋). When Ma Chao escaped from Zhang Lu and defected to Liu Bei, he left them behind in Hanzhong Commandery. Zhang Lu was later defeated by Cao Cao, to whom he surrendered. Cao Cao gave Lady Dong to Yan Pu (閻圃), a former adviser to Zhang Lu, and gave Ma Qiu to Zhang Lu. Zhang Lu personally killed Ma Qiu. It is not known who the mother(s) of Ma Chao&#x27;s two other children (Ma Cheng and the daughter) were, but she (or they) was probably neither Lady Yang nor Lady Dong.

Ma Chao&#x27;s younger cousin, Ma Dai, served as a general in Shu Han. His highest appointment was General Who Pacifies the North (平北將軍) and he was also enfeoffed as the Marquis of Chencang (陳倉侯).

Ma Ying-jeou, the President of Taiwan from 2008 to 2016, is an alleged descendant of Ma Chao. Researchers purportedly visited the old residence of Ma&#x27;s father, Ma Ho-ling, in Kaiyun Town, Hengshan County, Hunan, where they discovered a genealogy book stating that Ma descended from Ma Chao.

==Appraisal==
Ma Chao was known for his exceptional strength and for the great admiration he possessed among the ethnic tribes of the North. Chen Shou, who wrote Ma Chao&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, commented on him as such: &quot;Ma Chao relied solely on his relation with the foreign tribes (Xirong people) and his martial valor yet caused the extermination of his entire clan. What a great pity! However, he was able to break free from danger and finally reach peace, did all of his actions led him to a better fate?&quot;

Guan Yu once wrote to Zhuge Liang to ask who could compete with Ma Chao when he heard that Ma had recently joined Liu Bei&#x27;s force. Zhuge Liang replied, &quot;Mengqi (Mao Chao) is proficient in both civil and military affairs. He is fierce and mighty, and a hero of his time. He is comparable to Qing Bu and Peng Yue. He can compete with Yide, but is not as good as the peerless beard.&quot;

Yang Fu, one of the officials who opposed Ma Chao in Liang Province, once visited his colleague and relative Jiang Xu and Jiang Xu&#x27;s mother. He lamented about Ma Chao&#x27;s murder of Wei Kang and forceful occupation of Liang Province: &quot;[...] Ma Chao betrayed his father, rebelled against the Emperor, and massacred the officers in our province. [...] Ma Chao is strong but iniquitous. He is morally weak and susceptible to temptation and trickery.&quot; Yang Fu, Jiang Xu and several others later plotted against Ma Chao and drove him out of Liang Province. Ma Chao fought his way into Licheng (歷城) and captured Jiang Xu&#x27;s mother. She scolded him, &quot;You&#x27;re an unfilial son who betrays his own father and a treacherous villain who murders his superior. Heaven and Earth will not forgive you. You should die immediately. How dare you look at me straight in the eye!&quot; Ma Chao was furious and he killed her.

Yang Xi, who wrote the &quot;Ji Han Fuchen Zan&quot; (季漢輔臣贊; pub. 241), a collection of praises of notable persons who served in the Shu Han state, appraised him as follows: &quot;General of Agile Cavalry (驃騎將軍; Ma Chao) rose up, formed alliances, started an uprising in the Three Qins, and conquered the river and Tong Pass. He rebelled against the imperial court, regardless of whether his followers agreed or disagreed with him. In doing so, he provided an opportunity for the enemy to sow discord between him and his men, resulting in the destruction of his family and forces. He defied morals and ethics, and ended up having to rely on dragons and phoenixes.&quot;

The Jin dynasty historian Sun Sheng compared Ma Chao&#x27;s betrayal of his father Ma Teng to other historical examples of extreme cruelty and inhumaneness, including:
* the conflict between the Zhou dynasty and the vassal state of Zheng in 720 BCE;
* in 203 BCE, after Xiang Yu captured Liu Bang&#x27;s father and threatened to boil him alive if Liu Bang did not surrender, but then Liu Bang asked Xiang Yu to share a bowl of his father&#x27;s flesh with him;
* Wei Ao (隗嚣) raising troops against Liu Xiu (Emperor Guangwu of Han) despite his son being a political hostage at Liu&#x27;s court; Liu later killed Wei&#x27;s son.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Ma Chao is featured as a prominent character in some chapters in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. However, in the novel, the descriptions of his character and personality, as well as the order of some events involving him, had been modified to very large extents for dramatic effect. In the novel, he was nicknamed &quot;Ma Chao the Splendid&quot; for his elaborate armour and grand skill as a warrior, and was one of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei.

Ma Chao is introduced in Chapter 10, where he participates in a campaign led by his father and Han Sui against Li Jue and Guo Si in Chang&#x27;an in 192, during which he slays the enemy officers Wang Fang (王方) and Li Meng (李蒙). He does not reappear until Chapter 57, in which he suggests to his father that he could lead the army against Cao Cao at Xuchang in 211 to follow Emperor Xian&#x27;s orders to slay Cao Cao, but his father tells him to remain in Liang Province and command the Qiang troops there. After his father is killed by Cao Cao, Ma Chao, Han Sui and another eight officers fight against Cao Cao at the Battle of Tong Pass, during which Ma Chao fights with Cao Cao&#x27;s generals Xu Chu, Yu Jin, Cao Hong and Zhang He, and slays Li Tong. Later, Cao Cao&#x27;s strategist, Jia Xu, suggests to Cao Cao to send a letter containing errors and markings (making it seem as though the recipient has something to hide) to Han Sui to make Ma Chao falsely believe that Han Sui is maintaining secret contact with Cao Cao. Ma Chao gradually becomes more suspicious of Han Sui, who also has the intention of defecting to Cao Cao&#x27;s side after learning that Ma Chao no longer trusts him. Han Sui manages to escape when Ma Chao tries to kill him, but his left hand is cut off by Ma during the fight. Ma Chao is eventually defeated by Cao Cao&#x27;s forces, but manages to escape and find shelter among the Qiang tribes.

Ma Chao later joins forces with Zhang Lu to attack Cao Cao, but fails to make any significant gains. Zhang Lu, who distrusts Ma Chao, sends Yang Bo to spy on Ma, but Yang Bo is later killed. Ma Chao then helps Liu Zhang, the governor of Yi Province, deal with an invasion on Yi Province by Liu Bei. He duels with Liu Bei&#x27;s sworn brother, Zhang Fei, at the Battle of Jiameng Pass. Later, he is convinced by Li Hui to defect to Liu Bei, who accepts him and makes him a general. He fights for Liu Bei in the Hanzhong Campaign and is later posted to Xiping, where he defends Liu Bei&#x27;s strongholds from the Xianbei chieftain Kebineng.

Although Ma Chao historically died in 222, in the novel, he is mentioned to be still alive during Zhuge Liang&#x27;s southern campaign against the Nanman and is in charge of guarding Hanzhong from possible attacks by the state of Cao Wei. He died of illness after Zhuge Liang returned from the campaign. Zhuge Liang tells Zhao Yun that Ma Chao&#x27;s death felt like the loss of an arm to him.

==In popular culture==

Ma is sometimes venerated as a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples in Hebei and Henan, usually in partnership with Ma Dai or Zhao Yun.

Ma Chao appears as a strong general in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; strategy game series.

Ma Chao appears as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series.

In the collectible card game &quot;&quot;, there is a card named &quot;Ma Chao, Western Warrior&quot; in the &quot;Portal Three Kingdoms&quot; set.

He appeared as a playable character in Total War: Three Kingdoms, being featured as the heir of Ma Teng&#x27;s faction.

<text>Gaius Sempronius Gracchus ( – 121 BC) was a reformist Roman politician and soldier who lived during the 2nd century BC. He is most famous for his tribunate for the years 123 and 122 BC, in which he proposed a wide set of laws, including laws to establish colonies outside of Italy, engage in further land reform, reform the judicial system and system for provincial assignments, and create a subsidised grain supply for Rome.

The year after his tribunate, his political enemies used political unrest – which he and his political allies had caused – as an excuse to declare martial law and march on his supporters, leading to his death. After his death, his political allies were purged in a series of trials, but most of his legislation was undisturbed.

His brother was the reformer Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus. Both, known together as the Gracchi brothers, were the sons of the Gracchus who was consul in 177 and 163 BC.

== Background ==

Gaius Gracchus was born into a very well-connected political family. His father, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, was a very successful politician of the 2nd century BC: he served in the consulships for 177 and 163 BC, and was elected censor in 169. He also had celebrated two triumphs during the 170s, one for the victorious establishment of a twenty-year-long peace in Spain.

His mother was Cornelia, daughter of Scipio Africanus, a noble woman who was a major influence on the Gracchi. As a widow, after the elder Gracchus&#x27; death, she refused the marriage proposal of Ptolemy VIII, the king of Egypt, preferring to devote her life to the upbringing of her sons.

Tiberius Gracchus, Gaius&#x27; elder brother, had through his marriage aligned the family with the Claudii Pulchri, despite his maternal connections to the Cornelii Scipiones, as the two families had a historic rivalry. It can be supposed, however, that both the Gracchi brothers would have come into contact with powerful members of both families.

== Early political career ==
Gaius Gracchus served in the Roman army under Scipio Aemilianus during the final campaign in the Numantine War in 133 BC. He may have held the military tribunate during his service there. During his elder brother Tiberius&#x27; tribunate, he started his political career with election as a commissioner in the Gracchan land commission to distribute public land to poor families.

In 126 BC, he supported Marcus Fulvius Flaccus&#x27; political programme. While in Rome, he opposed a proposed tribunician law to prohibit non-citizens from settling in Roman towns and evict those who had done so. He then was elected as quaestor and assigned to the Roman province of Sardinia to fight the rebels there under consul Lucius Aurelius Orestes.

During a harsh winter, Gracchus was successful in procuring supplies from the Sardinians for the hard-pressed Roman troops. Orestes&#x27; command in Sardinia was prorogued for a second time, extending it to the point where Gaius wanted to leave to continue his career. Plutarch reports, probably based on Gracchus&#x27; own statements, that the reason for his commander&#x27;s prorogation was because the senate wanted to keep him away from Rome, an allegation which is &quot;patently absurd&quot;: the reason for the prorogation was almost certainly because Orestes&#x27; campaign was not complete and Orestes wanted to win his triumph.

Gracchus, regardless, quit Sardinia and returned to the city early, without the permission of his commander. After his return, he was also interrogated by the censors on why he had quit his post: in response, he pleaded that he had already served longer than most, that he had a right to return after one year, and that his good character and services were more than sufficient: in effect, he &quot;pleaded his right to be released as justification for releasing himself&quot;. He was later accused of aiding in an Italian revolt at Fregellae that had occurred in 125 BC, but was successful in rebutting the charges; well known to the people, he stood for election as tribune and won.

== Tribunate ==

Gaius was elected as one of the tribunes of the plebs for 123 BC. He embarked on an aggressive legislative programme immediately, aiming very broadly to appeal to many interest groups along with a &quot;rousing style of public speaking that made him the greatest [Roman orator] between Cato the censor and Cicero&quot;.

Gaius also changed how speeches were delivered from the rostra. Formerly, when a speaker delivered a speech in the forum, he turned his face to the right in the direction of the curia, the senate house, and the comitium. Instead, Gaius would turn his face to the left, toward the direction of the Forum proper, effectively turning his back on the Senate.

=== First tribunate (123 BC) ===

In his first year, as one of the tribunes for 123 BC, he proposed two initial measures: (1) a bill to prohibit any magistrate deposed by the people from standing again for office and (2) a law to reaffirm appeal to the people in capital cases which made transgressing magistrates liable for prosecution. The first bill was withdrawn at the request of his mother, Cornelia. Courts with capital punishment, not set up by the people, were now declared illegal &quot;ex post facto&quot;, which saw the former consul for 132 BC, Publius Popillius Laenas, driven into exile.

He then proposed a grain law establishing a maximum price of six and a third &quot;asses&quot; for a &quot;modius&quot; (about 8.7 litres), of grain and re-enacted Tiberius&#x27; law on agricultural land redistribution. The subsidised grain would be bought when prices were low and stored in public granaries; the price itself was &quot;probably a little below the price fetched by wheat immediately after the harvest&quot;. 

His elder brother&#x27;s &quot;lex agraria&quot; had been successful: Gracchan boundary stones are found all over southern Italy, and suggest distribution of some 1.3 million jugera (or 3,268 square kilometres) of land, accommodating somewhere between 70 and 130 thousand settlers. The contents of Gaius&#x27; further land reform are less clear: &quot;the sources are rather vague about the agrarian activities of Gaius&quot;. Mommsen asserted that he revitalised the commission by transferring to it jurisdiction over land disputes from the consuls, but of this there is no explicit evidence. The new law did clarify which land could be redistributed, however, and after his first year as tribune there are boundary stones (&quot;cippi&quot;) showing that he was successful in redistributing land around Apulia. He also probably carried laws authorising new Roman colonies at Scolacium and Tarentum. His novel policy of establishing colonies outside of Italy made him &quot;apparently the first to realise that the amount of land in Italy was insufficient to provide for all inhabitants of the peninsula&quot;.

The legislative programme also included a law, the &quot;lex militaris&quot;, to provide soldiers&#x27; clothing from the public treasury and prohibit conscription of men below the age of seventeen. While the conscription age limit had already previously been law, &quot;it is commonly said that Gracchus [included] this provision because [of] recent cases of persons below the minimum age being conscripted&quot;; but this is rejected as implausible. The law more likely simply restated the conditions of military service.

This was followed by a law to establish farming tithes in Asia, &quot;which in effect handed [the people of the province] over to the large corporations of tax farmers&quot;, to shore up support among the equestrians. A further bill to incorporate either 300 or 600 equestrians into the senate was probably ineffectual.

He also proposed a law, the &quot;lex Sempronia de provinciis consularibus&quot;, for the senate to assign consular provinces before elections to the consulship. He also made such senatorial assignments immune from tribunician veto; Ernst Badian notes &quot;this law shows how far he was from being a &#x27;democrat. The purpose of the &quot;lex de provinciis consularibus&quot; was to prevent sitting consuls from using their positions in the electoral &quot;comitia&quot; to influence provincial assignments improperly. In general, his reforms were addressing major issues in administration. At the same time, he was a &quot;proud aristocrat&quot; and left the senate in charge of directing policy and its execution by magistrates, under more stringent checks by the people and anti-corruption laws. The ultimate result of his laws, however, was to set up the equestrian &quot;publicani&quot; as &quot;a new exploiting class, not restrained by a tradition of service or accountability at law&quot;; these consequences did not become clear for a generation. Further legislation included some laws establishing new customs duties. 

At the elections of 123 BC, according to Plutarch, Gaius did not stand for election at all; rather, the tribes elected him spontaneously, with the election ratified by the presiding magistrate. Re-election might not have suited his plans – Gaius was needed in Africa to supervise construction of a colony at Carthage – but he was returned to the tribunate with friends: Marcus Fulvius Flaccus would be one of this tribunician colleagues and Gaius Fannius would be consul.

=== Second tribunate (122 BC) ===

Either after re-election to a second tribunate or during the second tribunate itself, he passed a law to transfer the jury pool in corruption courts (&quot;quaestio de repetundis&quot;) to the equestrians. This law, however, &quot;merely reallocated influence from one section of the elite to another&quot; and &quot;did not &#x27;democratise&#x27; [the &quot;repetundae&quot; court], merely hand[ing] control to non-senatorial members of the elite&quot;. This law also substantially changed Roman criminal procedure by allowing the allies to prosecute (both directly and through an intermediary) ex-magistrates for corruption.

The difficulty of finding enough land in Italy for resettlement – as taking land from the Italian allies was politically impossible as it would have &quot;wrought serious damage to their interests&quot; – led Gaius and his allies to pursue both Italian and foreign colonisation programmes. An ally of Gaius Gracchus, Gaius Rubrius, as part of the Gracchan programme, successfully carried a law to establish a colony at Carthage. One of the other tribunes in this year, Marcus Livius Drusus, countered Gaius and Rubrius&#x27; programme by proposing twelve colonies of three thousand needy families each, with allotments of land free from rent. Drusus&#x27; proposals passed also, but &quot;came to nothing&quot;; regardless, the passage led to establishment of a series of three-man boards to manage the various colonisation programmes. Supposedly, these proposals from Livius Drusus were brought at the prompting of the senate, which sought to find someone else to rival Gracchus&#x27; popularity.

Gaius also proposed, in probably two citizenship bills, giving citizenship to the Latins and Latin rights to Italian allies. Gaius&#x27; rationale may have been related to the land reform measures:

The first bill, to give citizenship to the Latins, was vetoed by Drusus, and the second bill on Latin rights for the Italians may have also given them full citizenship rights; but, although Fannius was an ally of Gracchus, he opposed the second bill. Drusus countered Gaius&#x27; Italian citizenship bill with a much less extensive bill to exempt them from scourging, which passed. Fannius, for his part, was able to mobilise opposition to extending citizenship by convincing the people that extending citizenship would require them to share their privileges. A fragment of Fannius&#x27; speech survives:

The issue persisted through the end of the year to the consular elections, when Fannius promulgated an edict expelling Italians from Rome, which was opposed by an edict of Gaius&#x27; which allegedly promised tribunician protection for any Italians who remained (but was, in the event unfulfilled).

He also proposed a bill to have the centuries (the Roman voting blocs) vote in a random order rather than in traditional order in which the richest centuries voted first. This would not have changed the overweighting of the rich in the Roman &quot;comitia&quot;, but would have ensured &quot;the chances of those who drew their support from the poorer citizens would not be prejudiced&quot;. There is, however, no evidence that this bill passed.

During his second tribunate, he left the city – perhaps sanctioned by the senate – to supervise the foundation of the colony at Carthage, which supposedly was plagued with bad omens. The citizenship bills&#x27; failure, however, revealed his waning popularity, and he was defeated when he stood for re-election to a third consecutive tribunate.

== Outbreak of violence ==

In the new year, some of Gaius&#x27; and his allies&#x27; legislative programme came under attack. One of the tribunes for 121 BC, Minucius Rufus, wished to repeal the &quot;lex Rubria&quot; authorising the construction of the colony at Carthage. When an attendant jeered at Gracchus and his entourage during a sacrifice and was stabbed to death with styluses, the consul Lucius Opimius summoned a meeting of the senate, which Gracchus and his ally – Marcus Fulvius Flaccus – did not attend.

At the senate meeting, the senate moved the &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot; and urged Opimius to attack Gracchus and his allies. In response, Gracchus and Flaccus armed their followers and seized the temple of Diana on the Aventine hill. Opimius called out the militia, along with some Cretan mercenary archers, and ordered the two to submit themselves to the judgement of the senate. Then, Opimius marched into the Aventine with his forces, offering a bounty, promising Gaius&#x27; head&#x27;s weight in gold. Flaccus and his sons were killed, Gracchus was either killed or committed suicide after fleeing across the river Tiber.

The claimant of the bounty removed the brain and substituted it with molten lead to increase the weight before claiming the reward.

== Aftermath ==
In the aftermath of Gaius&#x27; death, a judicial inquiry was established to try Gracchan supporters. Apparently, &quot;many were executed after a brief investigation without the formalities of trial&quot;, with an extensive purge reportedly of thousands. Plutarch also reports that Gaius, Flaccus, and others&#x27; estates were confiscated, along with the dowry of his widow, Licinia; Plutarch, however, is likely wrong in this matter; it is more likely that only their houses were demolished, with their estates passing thence to their heirs.

Opimius was not entirely unreflective of his actions. Following the strife,

Many in Rome, however, did not share his religious pretensions: according to Plutarch, one night an inscription was carved that read &quot;A work of mad discord produces a temple of Concord.&quot; The events of this year also spilled into the next year. When Opimius gave up his consulship, he was prosecuted by Publius Decius – one of the plebeian tribunes for 120 BC – on charges of violating the &quot;lex Sempronia&quot; which Gaius had passed that prohibited the execution of Roman citizens without appeal to the people. Opimius, however, was able to successfully defend himself by pointing to the &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot; and claiming that his opponents did not deserve treatment akin to that of Roman citizens; his successful defence enabled such senatorial decrees to be used as &quot;carte blanche for the most brutal reprisals&quot;. The use of force itself, furthermore, set a precedent &quot;suggest[ing] violence as the logical and more effective alternative to political engagement, negotiation, and compromise&quot;.

Gaius&#x27; legislation, however, mostly survived, revealing again that &quot;it was no longer a specific issue that mattered so much as the urgent necessity to triumph over rivals&quot;. While the African colonies law was repealed, a new agrarian law continued distribution of territories around Carthage to the poor, and colonial schemes in Italy survived with minor changes. The matter of citizenship for the Italians, however, was not reintroduced for some thirty years. As a whole, &quot;the aristocracy&#x27;s reaction resembled that of a general dealing with a mutiny, who accedes to most of the demands but executes the ringleaders to preserve discipline&quot;. Overseas colonial projects also did not end: just a few years later, a bill was carried in defiance of the senate establishing a colony at Narbonne.

Only in 111 BC, some ten years later, was the Gracchan land commission disestablished by another &quot;lex agraria&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;lex Thoria&quot; but attribution is disputed), not because of plutocratic influence, but because the job of distributing public lands was complete. All public land distributed or otherwise confirmed under the Gracchan land reform laws was confirmed and fully privatised. By this point, practically the only remaining &quot;ager publicus&quot; was common pastureland or land under long-term leases, land which could not be distributed.

Gaius Gracchus&#x27; subsidised grain law also survived past this death. It was repealed only in the last decade of the century, by a Marcus Octavius who was tribune some time between 122 and 104, but was quickly revived by Lucius Appuleius Saturninus.

<text>The Chicago Sun-Times is a daily nonprofit newspaper published in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Since 2022, it is the flagship paper of Chicago Public Media, and has long held the second largest circulation among Chicago newspapers, after the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

The &quot;Sun-Times&quot; resulted from the 1948 merger of the &quot;Chicago Sun&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Daily Times&quot; newspapers. Journalists at the paper have received eight Pulitzer Prizes, mostly in the 1970s; one recipient was the first film critic to receive the prize, Roger Ebert (1975), who worked at the paper from 1967 until his death in 2013. Long owned by the Marshall Field family, since the 1980s ownership of the paper has changed hands several times, including twice in the late 2010s.

==History==
The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; has claimed to be the oldest continuously published daily newspaper in the city. That claim is based on the 1844 founding of the &quot;Chicago Daily Journal&quot;, which was also the first newspaper to publish the rumor, now believed false, that a cow owned by Catherine O&#x27;Leary was responsible for the Chicago fire of 1871. The &quot;Journal&quot;, whose West Side building at 17–19 S. Canal was undamaged, gave the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; a temporary home until it could rebuild. Though much of the assets of the &quot;Journal&quot; were sold to the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; in 1929, its last owner Samuel Emory Thomason also immediately launched the tabloid &quot;Chicago Daily Illustrated Times&quot; from the same editorial offices of the discontinued &quot;Journal&quot;.

The modern paper grew out of the 1948 merger of the &quot;Chicago Sun&quot;, founded by Marshall Field III on December 4, 1941, and the &quot;Chicago Daily Times&quot; (which had dropped the &quot;Illustrated&quot; from its title) published from 1929 to 1948. The newspaper was owned by Field Enterprises, controlled by the Marshall Field family, which acquired the afternoon &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; in 1959 and launched WFLD television in 1966. When the &quot;Daily News&quot; ended its run in 1978, much of its staff, including Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Mike Royko, were moved to the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;. During the Field period, the newspaper had a populist, progressive character that leaned Democratic but was independent of the city&#x27;s Democratic establishment. Although the graphic style was urban tabloid, the paper was well regarded for journalistic quality and did not rely on sensational front-page stories. It also typically ran articles from &quot;The Washington Post&quot;/&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wire service.

===The 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s===

Among the most prominent members of the newspaper&#x27;s staff was cartoonist Jacob Burck, who was hired by the &quot;Chicago Times&quot; in 1938, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1941 and continued with the paper after it became the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;, drawing nearly 10,000 cartoons over a 44-year career.

The advice column &quot;Ask Ann Landers&quot; debuted in 1943. Ann Landers was the pseudonym of staff writer Ruth Crowley, who answered readers&#x27; letters until 1955. Eppie Lederer, sister of &quot;Dear Abby&quot; columnist Abigail van Buren, assumed the role thereafter as Ann Landers.

&quot;Kup&#x27;s Column&quot;, written by Irv Kupcinet, also made its first appearance in 1943.

Jack Olsen joined the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; as editor-in-chief in 1954, before moving on to &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazines and authoring true-crime books. Hired as literary editor in 1955 was Hoke Norris, who also covered the civil-rights movement for the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;.

Jerome Holtzman became a member of the &quot;Chicago Sun&quot; sports department after first being a copy boy for the &quot;Daily News&quot; in the 1940s. He and Edgar Munzel, another longtime sportswriter for the paper, both would end up honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Famed for his World War II exploits, two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Bill Mauldin made the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; his home base in 1962. The following year, Mauldin drew one of his most renowned illustrations, depicting a mourning statue of Abraham Lincoln after the November 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy.

Two years out of college, Roger Ebert became a staff writer in 1966, and a year later was named &quot;Sun-Times&quot;″s film critic. He continued in this role for the remainder of his life.

=== The 1970s ===
In 1975, a new sports editor at the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;, Lewis Grizzard, spiked some columns written by sportswriter Lacy J. Banks and took away a column Banks had been writing, prompting Banks to tell a friend at the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot; that Grizzard was a racist. After the friend wrote a story about it, Grizzard fired Banks. With that, the editorial employees union intervened, a federal arbitrator ruled for Banks, and 13 months later he got his job back.

A 25-part series on the Mirage Tavern, a saloon on Wells Street bought and operated by the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; in 1977, exposed a pattern of civic corruption and bribery, as city officials were investigated and photographed without their knowledge. The articles received considerable publicity and acclaim, but a nomination for the Pulitzer Prize met resistance from some who believed the Mirage series represented a form of entrapment.

In March 1978, the venerable afternoon publication the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, sister paper of the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;, went out of business. The two newspapers shared the same ownership and office building. James F. Hoge, Jr., editor and publisher of the Daily News, assumed the same positions at the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;, which also retained a number of the &quot;Daily News&quot;″s editorial personnel.

=== The 1980s ===
In 1980, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; hired syndicated TV columnist Gary Deeb away from the rival &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. Deeb then left the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; in the spring of 1983 to try his hand at TV. He joined Chicago&#x27;s WLS-TV in September 1983.

In July 1981, prominent &quot;Sun-Times&quot; investigative reporter Pam Zekman, who had been part of a Pulitzer Prize-winning team with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1976, announced she was leaving the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; to join WBBM-TV in Chicago in August 1981 as chief of its new investigative unit. &quot;Salary wasn&#x27;t a factor,&quot; she told the &quot;Tribune&quot;. &quot;The station showed a commitment to investigative journalism. It was something I wanted to try.&quot;

Pete Souza left the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; in 1983 to become official White House photographer for President Ronald Reagan until his second term&#x27;s end in 1989. Souza returned to that position to be the official photographer for President Barack Obama.

Baseball writer Jerome Holtzman defected from the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; to the &quot;Tribune&quot; in late 1981, while Mike Downey also left &quot;Sun-Times&quot; sports in September 1981 to be a columnist at the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;.

In January 1984, noted &quot;Sun-Times&quot; business reporter James Warren quit to join the rival &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. He became the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s Washington bureau chief and later its managing editor for features.

In 1984, Field Enterprises co-owners, half-brothers Marshall Field V and Ted Field, sold the paper to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation, and the paper&#x27;s style changed abruptly to mirror that of its suitemate, the &quot;New York Post&quot;. Its front pages tended more to the sensational, while its political stance shifted markedly to the right. This was in the era that the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; had begun softening its traditionally staunchly Republican editorial line, blurring the city&#x27;s clear division between the two newspapers&#x27; politics. This shift was made all but official when Mike Royko defected to the &quot;Tribune&quot;.

Roger Ebert later reflected on the incident with disdain, stating in his blog, 

Murdoch sold the paper in 1986 (to buy its former sister television station WFLD to launch the Fox network) for $145 million in cash in a leveraged buyout to an investor group led by the paper&#x27;s publisher, Robert E. Page, and the New York investment firm Adler &amp; Shaykin.

In 1984, Roger Simon, who had been a &quot;Sun-Times&quot; columnist for a decade, quit to join &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, where he worked until 1995. Simon quit the paper because of Murdoch&#x27;s purchase of it. Beginning in October 1984, Simon&#x27;s columns from Baltimore began appearing in the rival &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

In November 1986, The Sun-Times acquired Star Publications, a chain of 12 south and southwest suburban papers published twice weekly, for an undisclosed sum.

In December 1986, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; hired high-profile gossip columnist Michael Sneed away from the rival &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, where she had been co-authoring the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s own &quot;Inc.&quot; gossip column with Kathy O&#x27;Malley. On December 3, 1986, O&#x27;Malley led off the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s &quot;Inc.&quot; column with the heading &quot;The Last to Know Dept.&quot; and writing, &quot;Dontcha just hate it when you write a gossip column and people think you know all the news about what&#x27;s going on and your partner gets a new job and your column still has her name on it on the very same day that her new employer announces that she&#x27;s going to work for him? Yeah, INC. just hates it when that happens.&quot;

In February 1987, the popular syndicated advice column &quot;Ask Ann Landers&quot; (commonly known as the &quot;Ann Landers&quot; column and written at that point by Eppie Lederer) left the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; after 31 years to jump to the rival &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, effective March 15, 1987. The move sparked a nationwide hunt for a new advice columnist for the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;. After more than 12,000 responses from people aged 4 to 85, the paper ultimately hired two: Jeffrey Zaslow, then a 28-year-old &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reporter, and Diane Crowley, a 47-year-old lawyer, teacher and daughter of Ruth Crowley, who had been the original Ann Landers columnist from 1943 until 1955. Crowley left to return to the practice of law in 1993 and the paper decided not to renew Zaslow&#x27;s contract in 2001.

By the summer of 1988, Page and Adler &amp; Shaykin managing partner Leonard P. Shaykin had developed a conflict, and in August 1988, Page resigned as publisher and president and sold his interest in the paper to his fellow investors.

In January 1989, the Sun-Times company starts its plans to purchase The Pioneer Press and its 38 different weekly publications.

=== The 1990s ===
In mid-1991, veteran crime reporter Art Petacque, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1974, left the paper. Almost ten years later, Dennis Britton, who had been the paper&#x27;s editor at the time of Petacque&#x27;s retirement, told the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; that Petacque&#x27;s departure, which was described at the time as a retirement, was involuntary. &quot;I had problems with some of the ways Art pursued his job,&quot; Britton told the &quot;Reader&quot;.

In September 1992, Bill Zwecker joined the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; as a gossip columnist from the troubled Lerner Newspapers suburban weekly newspaper chain, where he had written the &quot;VIPeople&quot; column.

In September 1992, &quot;Sun-Times&quot; sports clerk Peter Anding was arrested in the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;&#x27; newsroom and held without bond after confessing to using his position to set up sexual encounters for male high school athletes. Anding was charged with aggravated criminal sexual assault and possession of child pornography. In September 1993, Anding pleaded guilty to arranging and videotaping sexual encounters with several teenage boys and fondling others. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison.

In 1993, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; fired photographer Bob Black without severance for dozens of unauthorized uses of the company&#x27;s Federal Express account and outside photo lab, going back more than three years and costing the company more than $1,400. In February 1994, however, Black rejoined the paper&#x27;s payroll after an arbitrator agreed with the paper&#x27;s union that dismissal was too severe a penalty. At the same time, the arbitrator declined to award Black back pay.

In 1993, longtime &quot;Sun-Times&quot; reporter Larry Weintraub retired after 35 years at the paper. Weintraub had been best known for his &quot;Weintraub&#x27;s World&quot; column, in which he worked a job and wrote about the experience. Weintraub died in 2001 at age 69.

In February 1994, the Adler &amp; Shaykin investor group sold the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; to Hollinger Inc. for about $180 million. Hollinger was controlled, indirectly, by Canadian-born businessman Conrad Black. After Black and his associate David Radler were indicted for skimming money from Hollinger International, through retaining noncompete payments from the sale of Hollinger newspapers, they were removed from the board, and Hollinger International was renamed the Sun-Times Media Group.

In 1994, noted reporter M.W. Newman retired from the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; around the age of 77. Newman, who died of lung cancer in 2001, had been with the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; since the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; closed in 1978 and had focused his efforts on urban reporting. Among other things, Newman had been known for coining the term &quot;Big John&quot; to describe the John Hancock Center and the expression &quot;Fortress Illini&quot; for the concrete structures and plazas at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

On March 23, 1995, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; announced that beginning April 2, 1995, veteran &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Rick Telander would join the paper and write four columns a week.

On March 24, 1995, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; published an editorial by Mark Hornung, then the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;&#x27; editorial page editor, that plagiarized a &quot;Washington Post&quot; editorial that had appeared in that paper the day before. Hornung attributed the plagiarism to writer&#x27;s block, deadline pressures and the demands of other duties. He resigned as editorial page editor, but remained with the paper, shifting to its business side and working first as director of distribution and then as vice president of circulation. In 2002, Hornung became president and publisher of Midwest Suburban Publishing, which was a company owned by then-&quot;Sun Times&quot; parent company Hollinger International. In June 2004, Hollinger International placed Hornung on administrative leave just two weeks after Hollinger revealed that the paper&#x27;s sales figures had been inflated for several years. Hornung resigned from the company four days later.

On May 17, 1995, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;&#x27; food section published a bogus letter from a reader named &quot;Olga Fokyercelf&quot; that &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist (and former &quot;Sun-Times&quot; columnist) Mike Royko called &quot;an imaginative prank&quot; in a column. In that same column, Royko criticized the paper&#x27;s food writer, who edited the readers&#x27; column at the time, Olivia Wu, for not following better quality control. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; then criticized Royko with an article of its own, titled, &quot;Has a Curmudgeon Turned Into a Bully? Some Now Think So...Picking on a Food Writer.&quot; Although the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; began hiring a freelancer to edit the space and look for double entendres, another one made it into the same column on July 26, 1995, when the section published a letter from a &quot;Phil McCraken.&quot; &quot;This one was a little more subtle,&quot; a reporter outside the food department told the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;.
In 1998, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; demoted longtime TV critic Lon Grahnke, shifting him to covering education. Grahnke, who died in 2006 at age 56 of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, remained with the paper until 2001, when he retired following an extended medical leave.

=== The 2000s ===
In 2000, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; new editors, Michael Cooke and John Cruickshank, tapped longtime staff reporter Mark Brown, who had considered himself an investigative reporter, to write a column that would anchor page two of the paper.

In 2000, longtime investigative reporter Charles Nicodemus retired from the paper at age 69 and died in 2008 at age 77.

In 2001, &quot;Sun-Times&quot; investigative reporter Chuck Neubauer quit the paper to join the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&#x27; Washington bureau. Neubauer and Brown had initiated the investigation into U.S. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski that uncovered a variety of misdeeds that ultimately had led to Rostenkowski&#x27;s indictment, conviction and imprisonment.

In April 2001, &quot;Sun-Times&quot; architecture critic Lee Bey quit to join the administration of then-Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley as Daley&#x27;s deputy mayoral chief of staff, responsible for downtown planning, rewriting the city&#x27;s zoning code and affordable housing issues.

In April 2001, longtime &quot;Sun-Times&quot; horse-racing writer Dave Feldman died at age 85 while still on the payroll.

In May 2002, &quot;Sun-Times&quot; editors Joycelyn Winnecke and Bill Adee, who were then husband and wife, both quit on the same day to join the rival &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. Winnecke had been the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; managing editor, and she left for a new post, associate managing editor for national news, while Adee, who had been the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; sports editor for nine years, became the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s sports editor/news.

In October 2003, &quot;Sun-Times&quot; gossip columnist Irv Kupcinet began including the name of his longtime assistant of nearly 34 years, Stella Foster, as the coauthor of his column. After Kupcinet died the following month at age 91, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; kept Foster on and gave her the sole byline on the column, which became known as &quot;Stella&#x27;s Column.&quot; Foster retired from the newspaper in 2012.

In 2004, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; was censured by the Audit Bureau of Circulations for misrepresenting its circulation figures.

In February 2004, longtime &quot;Sun-Times&quot; political columnist Steve Neal died at his home in Hinsdale, Illinois, at age 54, of an apparent suicide.

In August 2004, longtime Chicago broadcast journalist Carol Marin began writing regular columns in the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;, mostly on political issues.

In March 2005, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; hired away television critic Phil Rosenthal to become its media columnist. He eventually was replaced as TV critic by Doug Elfman.

On September 28, 2005, &quot;Sun-Times&quot; columnist and editorial board member Neil Steinberg was arrested in his home in Northbrook, Illinois and charged with domestic battery and with interfering with the reporting of domestic battery. With that, Steinberg, who had been at the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; since 1987, entered a treatment facility for alcohol abuse. On November 23, 2005, Cook County prosecutors dropped the charges against Steinberg after his wife said she no longer feared for her safety. On November 28, 2005, Steinberg returned to the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;″ pages after going through a 28-day rehabilitation program at a nearby hospital, and he gave readers his version of the events that led to his arrest: &quot;I got drunk and slapped my wife during an argument.&quot; Steinberg also reported that he and his wife were &quot;on the mend,&quot; and that he was working toward sobriety.

In the spring of 2006, a variety of longtime &quot;Sun-Times&quot; writers and columnists took buyouts, including sports columnist Ron Rapoport, sports reporter Joe Goddard, society and gardening columnist Mary Cameron Frey, book editor Henry Kisor, page designer Roy Moody and photographer Bob Black. Classical music critic Wynne Delacoma also took a buyout, and left the paper later.

In August 2006, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; dismissed longtime Chicago Cubs beat writer Mike Kiley. Then-&quot;Sun-Times&quot; sports editor Stu Courtney told the &quot;Tribune&quot; that the dismissal of Kiley, who had joined the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; from the &quot;Tribune&quot; in 1996, was a &quot;personnel matter I can&#x27;t comment on.&quot; The &quot;Tribune&quot;″s Teddy Greenstein called Kiley &quot;a fierce competitor.&quot;

In February 2007, noted &quot;Sun-Times&quot; columnist Debra Pickett quit upon returning from maternity leave. The reasons for her departure were differences with her editors over where her column appeared and the sorts of assignments being handed to her.

On July 10, 2007, newly appointed Editorial Page Editor Cheryl Reed announced: &quot;We [the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; editorial page] are returning to our liberal, working-class roots, a position that pits us squarely opposite the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;—that Republican, George Bush—touting paper over on moneyed Michigan Avenue.&quot;

In January 2008, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; underwent two rounds of layoffs. In its first round, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; fired editorial board members Michael Gillis, Michelle Stevens and Lloyd Sachs, along with Sunday editor Marcia Frellick and assistant managing editor Avis Weathersbee.

On February 4, 2008, Editorial Page Editor Cheryl Reed resigned saying in a front-page Chicago Tribune story that she was &quot;deeply troubled&quot; that the paper&#x27;s presidential primary endorsements of Barack Obama and John McCain were subjected to &quot;wholesale rewrites&quot; by editorial board outsiders. Cyrus Freidheim Jr., in his role as Sun-Times publisher, issued a statement reassuring staff that the endorsements did not change and that the rewrites only &quot;deepened and strengthened the messages.&quot;

Later that month, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; underwent more staff reductions, laying off columnist Esther Cepeda, religion reporter Susan Hogan/Albach, TV critic Doug Elfman, real estate editor Sally Duros, and onetime editor Garry Steckles, while giving buyouts to assistant city editors Robert C. Herguth and Nancy Moffett, environmental reporter Jim Ritter, copy editors Chris Whitehead and Bob Mutter, editorial columnist Steve Huntley (who remained with the paper as a freelance columnist), and special Barack Obama correspondent Jennifer Hunter. Also taking a buyout was longtime health and technology reporter Howard Wolinsky. Two other staffers, business editor Dan Miller and deputy metro editor Phyllis Gilchrist, resigned.

In August 2008, high-profile sports columnist Jay Mariotti resigned from the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; after concluding that the future of sports journalism was online.

In October 2008, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; gave buyouts to noted TV/radio writer Robert Feder (a blogger with &quot;Time Out Chicago&quot; and then an independent writer on Chicago media) and longtime auto writer Dan Jedlicka. The paper also laid off two members of its editorial board: Teresa Puente and Deborah Douglas.

In November 2008, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; dropped its &quot;Quick Takes&quot; column, which &quot;Sun-Times&quot; columnist Zay N. Smith had written since 1995. Smith wrote the column from home, and the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; discontinued the column and informed Smith that it needed him back in the newsroom as a general assignment reporter. The paper&#x27;s union complained, noting that Smith had permanent physical disabilities that made it difficult for him to be mobile. Smith later left the paper.

In March 2009, sports columnist Greg Couch left the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; after 12 years to join AOL Sports.

On March 31, 2009, the newspaper filed for bankruptcy protection.

On October 9, 2009, the &quot;Sun Times&quot; unions agreed to concessions paving the way for Jim Tyree to buy the newspaper and its 50 suburban newspapers. Of the $25 million purchase price, $5 million was in cash, with the other $20 million to help pay off past debts.

In November 2009, &quot;Sun-Times&quot; sports editor Stu Courtney quit to join the rival &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Chicago Breaking Sports website.

In December 2009, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; hired sports columnist Rick Morrissey away from the rival &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

=== The 2010s ===

In April 2010, longtime &quot;Sun-Times&quot; pop music critic Jim DeRogatis resigned from the paper to join the faculty of Columbia College Chicago and to begin blogging at Vocalo.org.

In June 2010, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; laid off a group of editorial employees, including longtime sports media columnist Jim O&#x27;Donnell and features writer Delia O&#x27;Hara.

In October 2010, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; laid off longtime sports columnist Carol Slezak, who by that point had shifted to feature reporting.

At the end of June 2010, longtime &quot;Sun-Times&quot; sportswriter Len Ziehm, who covered many sports but largely focused on golf, retired after 41 years at the paper.

Sun-Times Media group chairman James C. Tyree died under sudden circumstances in March 2011. Jeremy Halbreich, chief executive, said that Tyree&#x27;s will be greatly missed and that his death will make no changes in the media company&#x27;s strategy.

Also in March 2011, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; laid off six editorial reporters and writers: high school sports reporter Steve Tucker, reporter Misha Davenport, general assignment reporter Cheryl Jackson, media and marketing columnist Lewis Lazare, feature writer Celeste Busk and sportswriter John Jackson.

In May 2011, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; laid off real estate writer Bill Cunniff, features reporter Jeff Johnson and gaming writer John Grochowski, along with graphic designer Char Searl.

In June 2011, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; fired longtime TV critic Paige Wiser after she admitted to fabricating portions of a review of a Glee Live! In Concert! performance. She admitted to attending much of the concert but leaving early to tend to her children. The paper eventually tapped longtime travel writer Lori Rackl to replace Wiser as TV critic.

The &quot;Sun-Times&quot; announced in July 2011 that it would close its printing plant on Ashland Avenue in Chicago—eliminating 400 printing jobs—and would outsource the printing of the newspaper to the rival &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. The move was estimated to save $10 million a year. The &quot;Sun-Times&quot; already had been distributed by the Tribune since 2007.

In August 2011, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; laid off three more reporters and writers: sportswriter Mike Mulligan, &quot;Quick Hits&quot; sports columnist Elliott Harris and photographer Keith Hale.

In September 2011, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; fired longtime restaurant reviewer (and freelancer) Pat Bruno.

In October 2011, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; discontinued the longtime comic strip &quot;Drabble&quot; (syndicated by Newspaper Enterprise Association), which the paper had run since the strip&#x27;s inception in 1979. The comic strip was the victim of a reduced page size.

At the end of May 2013, the publication&#x27;s photography department was dissolved as part of a restructuring that involves the use of freelance photographers and non-photographer journalists to provide visual content. Under the terms of a settlement with the paper&#x27;s union, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; reinstated four of those photographers as multimedia journalists in March 2014: Rich Chapman, Brian Jackson, Al Podgorski and Michael Schmidt.

In March 2014, pop culture reporter Dave Hoekstra left the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; in a buyout after 29 years with the paper. Concurrent with Hoekstra&#x27;s departure, the company also laid off two &quot;Sun-Times&quot; editorial assistants, two editors at the &quot;SouthtownStar&quot;, a community editor at the &quot;Post-Tribune&quot; of Northwest Indiana and a weekend editor/designer at the company&#x27;s west suburban newspaper group.

In March 2016, Shia Kapos signed on to bring her Taking Names column to the Sun-Times. She had been writing the gossip column since 2007 for Crain&#x27;s Business.

On July 13, 2017, it was reported that a consortium consisting of private investors and the Chicago Federation of Labor led by businessman and former Chicago alderman Edwin Eisendrath through his company ST Acquisition Holdings, had acquired the paper and its parent company, Sun-Times Media Group, from then-owner Wrapports, beating out Chicago-based publishing company Tronc (formerly Tribune Publishing Company) for ownership.

In March 2019, a new ownership group took over and took control of the Sun-Times from the previous union ownership. The group, Sun-Times Investment Holdings LLC, was backed by prominent Chicago investors Michael Sacks and Rocky Wirtz.

=== The 2020s ===
On January 30, 2022, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; became not-for-profit when it was formally merged into the nonprofit Chicago Public Media, longtime owner of the city&#x27;s National Public Radio affiliate WBEZ. A nonbinding agreement for the deal had been announced in September 2021, and the board of Chicago Public Media had signalled its approval on January 18, 2022. The final arrangement was backed with $61 million from several philanthropic organizations.

In 2022 Jennifer Kho was appointed executive editor. She replaced veteran investigative reporter Steve Warmbir, who had shepherded the paper as interim editor during the Covid pandemic, ownership changes, and alliance with Chicago Public Radio newsroom.

In 2022 the Sun-Times switched its digital subscription model to voluntary donations. Subscribers could read the online paper for free or pay what they chose. Since the Sun-Times had become a not-for-profit, subscription payments are tax deductible.

==Facilities==
The headquarters are in the Chicago Navy Pier. WBEZ, affiliated with the newspaper, is the lessee of of space, which has radio and newspaper functions.

Prior to 2004, the headquarters were on Wabash Avenue. The newspaper had its headquarters in 350 North Orleans for a 13-year period, from 2004 to 2017. In 2017, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; moved to a facility on Racine, and in 2022 it was to open a facility in the Old Chicago Main Post Office.

Doug Moench was nominated for a Chicago Newspaper Guild Award in 1972 for his stream-of-consciousness story on violence in the Chicago subway system. In 1978, the newspaper conducted the Mirage Tavern investigation, in which undercover reporters operated a bar and caught city officials taking bribes on camera.

In January 2004, after a six-month investigation written by Tim Novak and Steve Warmbir, the paper broke the story of the Hired Truck Program scandal. After a &quot;Sun-Times&quot; article by Michael Sneed erroneously identified the perpetrator of the April 16, 2007 Virginia Tech massacre as an unnamed Chinese national, the People&#x27;s Republic of China criticized the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; for publishing what it called &quot;irresponsible reports.&quot; The newspaper later silently withdrew the story without making any apologies or excuses.

==Staff==
The &quot;Sun-Times&quot;&#x27; best-known writer was film critic Roger Ebert, who died in April 2013. Chicago columnist Mike Royko, previously of the defunct &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, came to the paper in 1978 but left for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1984 when the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; was purchased by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corp. Irv Kupcinet&#x27;s daily column was a fixture from 1943 until his death in 2003. It was also the home base of famed cartoonist Bill Mauldin from 1962 to 1991, as well as advice columnist Ann Landers and the Washington veteran Robert Novak for many years. Lisa Myers, the Senior Investigative Correspondent for NBC News, was the publication&#x27;s Washington correspondent from 1977 to 1979. Author Charles Dickinson worked as a copy editor for the publication from 1983 to 1989.

The newspaper gave a start in journalism to columnist Bob Greene, while other notable writers such as Mary Mitchell, Richard Roeper, Gary Houston, Michael Sneed, Mark Brown, Neil Steinberg, sportswriters Rick Telander and Rick Morrissey, theater critic Hedy Weiss, Carol Marin, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters Frank Main and Mark Konkol, and technology expert Andy Ihnatko have written for the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;. As of October 2013, Lynn Sweet is the Washington Bureau Chief and Pulitzer Prize-winner Jack Higgins is the publication&#x27;s editorial cartoonist.

John Cruickshank became the publisher in 2003 after David Radler, and on September 19, 2007, announced he was resigning to head the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s news division.

On May 30, 2013, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; laid off the vast majority of its photography staff as part of a change in its structure, opting instead to use photos and video shot by reporters, as well as content from freelancers, instead. Two staff photographers remained after the restructure: Rich Hein was named Photo Editor and Jessica Koscielniak, who was hired in January 2013, became the newspapers&#x27; only multimedia reporter. Among those photographers who were laid off was Pulitzer Prize winning photographer John White. In an official statement, the newspaper explained: &quot;The &quot;Sun-Times&quot; business is changing rapidly and our audiences are consistently seeking more video content with their news. We have made great progress in meeting this demand and are focused on bolstering our reporting capabilities with video and other multimedia elements.&quot;

==&quot;Early Edition&quot;==
The paper was featured in the CBS show &quot;Early Edition&quot;, where the lead character mysteriously receives each &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; newspaper the day before it is actually published.

<text>Wolf herrings are a family (Chirocentridae) of two marine species of ray-finned fish related to herrings.

Both species have elongated bodies and jaws with long sharp teeth that aid their ravenous appetites, primarily for other fish. They can grow up to1 m in length and have silvery sides with bluish backs.

They are commercially fished and sold fresh or frozen.

==Species==
* &quot;Chirocentrus dorab&quot; - Dorab wolf-herring, found in warm coastal waters from the Red Sea to Japan and Australia
* &quot;Chirocentrus nudus&quot; - whitefin wolf-herring, found in a similar range (This species is difficult to distinguish from &quot;C. dorab&quot;; the former has a black mark on its dorsal fin. This species is also known to eat crabs in addition to its usual diet of smaller fish.)

<doc id="245121" wikidata="Q277577" url="?curid=245121" title="Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset">
<text>Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, 1st Earl of Huntingdon, 7th Baron Ferrers of Groby, (145520 September 1501) was an English nobleman, courtier and the eldest son of Elizabeth Woodville and her first husband Sir John Grey of Groby. Her second marriage to King Edward IV made her Queen of England, thus elevating Grey&#x27;s status at court and in the realm as the stepson of the King. Through his mother&#x27;s endeavours, he made two materially advantageous marriages to wealthy heiresses, the King&#x27;s niece Anne Holland and the King’s cousin, Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington. By the latter, he had 14 children.

==Family==
Thomas Grey was born in 1455 close to the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. He was the elder son of John Grey (c.1432-1461) of Groby in Leicestershire, by his wife Elizabeth Woodville, who later became queen consort to King Edward IV.

==Career==
His mother endeavoured to improve his estates by the conventional methods of their class and time, through his marriages and purchase of wardships. He also found favour with Edward, fighting in the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471. Grey became Lord Harington and Bonville by right of his second wife Cecily Bonville. In 1475 he was created marquess of Dorset, and he was also a knight of the Garter and a privy councillor.

On the death of his stepfather, Edward IV, Grey proved unable to maintain his family&#x27;s position. It was not possible to arrange a Woodville regency. Internal fighting, particularly the long-established battle for ascendancy in Leicestershire between the Grey and Hastings families, was now on the national stage. Richard III came to the throne when the sons of Edward IV&#x27;s union with Elizabeth Woodville were declared bastards; the Grey family was aligned with Edward.

On 25 June 1483, an assembly of Parliament declared Richard III to be the legitimate king, and Thomas&#x27;s uncle, Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, and brother, Richard Grey, were executed. Later in the summer, learning of the apparent murder of both his young half-brothers, Grey joined the Duke of Buckingham&#x27;s rebellion against Richard III. When the rebellion failed he fled to Brittany to join Henry Tudor, who pledged to marry Grey&#x27;s half-sister Elizabeth of York and heal the division between the Yorkists and the Lancastrians.

However, just before Henry and the Lancastrian army left to launch their ultimately successful invasion of England in August 1485, Grey heard rumours from England that his mother had come to terms with Richard III, and he was persuaded to desert Henry Tudor. He was intercepted at Compiègne on his way to England, and played no part in the invasion or subsequent overthrow of Richard III. Grey was instead confined to Paris, as security for the repayment of a loan made to Henry Tudor by the French government, unable to return home until Henry VII was safely installed as king of England.

Thereafter Henry VII took good care to keep his half-brother-in-law under control and Grey was not permitted to recover his former influence, although his attainder was reversed. Thomas Grey was confined in the Tower in 1487 during Lambert Simnel&#x27;s rising and not released until after the House of Tudor victory at the Battle of Stoke Field. Though he accompanied the King on his expedition to France in 1492, he was obliged to commit himself in writing to ensure he did not commit treason. He was permitted to assist in the suppression of the Cornish rising in 1497.

Thomas Grey, Marquess of Dorset, died in London on 20 September 1501, aged about 46, and was buried in the collegiate church of Astley, Warwickshire. His widow married Grey&#x27;s cousin, Henry Stafford, later Earl of Wiltshire.

==Marriages and issue==
His mother sought to make provision for him by marriage to wealthy heiresses. He married firstly, at Greenwich in October 1466, Lady Anne Holland (1461c. 1474), the only daughter of Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, and Anne of York. His mother-in-law was the second child and eldest surviving daughter of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, and Cecily Neville, thus sister to his mother&#x27;s second husband King Edward IV.

After Anne Holland died young without issue, Thomas married secondly, by papal dispensation 5 September 1474, Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington of Aldingham and 2nd Baroness Bonville, the wealthiest heiress in England. Cecily Bonville, born in 1461, was the daughter and heiress of William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington, by his wife Katherine Neville, daughter of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury. Katherine was sister to the late Earl of Warwick and thus aunt to his daughters.

By his second wife Grey had seven sons and seven daughters:

*Lord Edward Grey, eldest son and heir, who predeceased his father, and was buried in the church of St Clement Danes, London. He married Anne (née Jerningham), daughter of Sir Edward Jerningham (died 6 January 1515) of Somerleyton, Suffolk, by Margaret Bedingfield (died 24 March 1504), by whom he had no issue. After his death she remarried four times, firstly to a husband surnamed Berkeley; secondly to Henry Barley (died 12 November 1529) of Albury, Hertfordshire; thirdly to Sir Robert Drury; and fourthly to Sir Edmund Walsingham.
*Anthony Grey, who predeceased his father.
*Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset (22 June 147722 June 1530), who married firstly Eleanor St John, by whom he had no issue, and secondly Margaret Wotton, widow of William Medley, esquire, and daughter of Sir Robert Wotton by Anne Belknap, daughter of Henry Belknap esquire, by whom he had four sons, including Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, father of Lady Jane Grey, and four daughters.
*Sir Richard Grey, who married Florence Pudsey. He is mentioned in the will of his brother, Sir John Grey.
*Sir John Grey, who married firstly Elizabeth Catesby, widow of Roger Wake (died 16 May 1504) of Blisworth, Northamptonshire, and daughter of Sir William Catesby, and secondly Anne Barley or Barlee (died 1557 or 1558), widow of Sir Robert Sheffield of Butterwick, Lincolnshire, Speaker of the House of Commons. Grey apparently had no issue by either of his wives, as his will dated 3 March 1523 makes no mention of children. After Grey&#x27;s death his widow, Anne, married Sir Richard Clement (d.1538) of Ightham Mote, Kent.
*Leonard Grey, 1st Viscount Grane (c. 149028 June 1541), According to Richardson, Grey married firstly Elizabeth Arundel, widow of Sir Giles Daubeney, and secondly Eleanor Sutton, daughter of Edward Sutton, 2nd Baron Dudley by Cecily Willoughby, daughter and coheiress of Sir William Willoughby; however according to Lyons it is unclear whether Grey ever married. He is mentioned in the will of his brother, Sir John Grey. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.
*George Grey, in holy orders. He is mentioned in the will of his brother, Sir John Grey.
*Cecily Grey (buried 28 April 1554 at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster), who married John Sutton, 3rd Baron Dudley.
*Bridget Grey, believed to have died young.
*Dorothy Grey, Baroness Montjoy (1480–1552), who married firstly Robert Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby de Broke, by whom she had issue, and secondly William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy.
*Elizabeth Grey, who married Gerald FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare.
*Margaret Grey, who married Richard Wake, esquire, She is mentioned, as &#x27;Margaret Grey&#x27;, in the will of her brother, Sir John Grey.
*Eleanor Grey (or &quot;Elizabeth&quot;) Grey (died by December 1503) who was the first wife of Sir John Arundell (1474–1545) of Lanherne, Cornwall, Receiver General of the Duchy of Cornwall and &quot;the most important man in the county&quot;.
*Mary Grey (149322 February 1538), who married Walter Devereux, 1st Viscount Hereford.

==Titles==
*Baron Astley, from 1461, inherited on the death of his father
*Earl of Huntingdon, 1471–1475, created for him. Surrendered and given to William Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, who himself was forced to surrender his own title so that the king could give it to his son, Edward.
*Lord Harington and Bonville in right of his (second) wife, from 1474, his wife being unable to sit in Parliament
*Marquess of Dorset, from 1475, created for Thomas Grey on 14 May 1475 (Whitsunday) in place of the re-possessed earldom of Huntingdon

<text>John Alexander Brymer OBE (27 January 191516 September 2003) was an English clarinettist and saxophonist. &quot;The Times&quot; called him &quot;the leading clarinettist of his generation, perhaps of the century&quot;. He was largely self-taught as a player and he performed as an amateur before being invited by Sir Thomas Beecham to join the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in 1947. He remained with the orchestra until 1963, two years after Beecham&#x27;s death.

Brymer played in the BBC Symphony and London Symphony Orchestras. He was also associated with several chamber music ensembles, and maintained a lifelong pleasure in playing jazz. He held professorships during most of the period from 1950 to 1993, first at the Royal Academy of Music, then at the Royal Military School of Music and finally at the Guildhall School of Music. He was a regular broadcaster, as a player and presenter and made recordings of solo works and with orchestras and smaller ensembles. He published two volumes of memoirs and a book about the clarinet.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Brymer was born in South Shields, County Durham, in the North East of England, the son of John Alexander Brymer, a builder, and his wife, Mary, &quot;née&quot; Dixon. Brymer senior played the clarinet, and his son started to attempt to play the instrument at the age of four. He had no formal instruction as a clarinettist, but discovered music and worked out an instrumental technique for himself. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote of him, &quot;Struggling with an inadequate instrument (a sharp-pitch A clarinet with a bit sawn off in the school woodwork room) and playing in local bands and amateur orchestras with people much older than himself, he learned his craft in the most practical way.&quot; While still a boy he encountered, and appreciated, a wide range of musical styles from jazz and light music to brass-bands and circuses. He later insisted that all these genres had been of great value to him professionally.

Brymer was educated at Westoe Secondary School, South Shields, excelling at rugby football. He hankered after a musical career, but as a profile in &quot;The Gramophone&quot; put it, &quot;The virtual collapse of the orchestral profession when sound entered the cinema, and musicians were thrown out of work by the hundred turned his thoughts elsewhere.&quot; From 1933 Brymer trained at Goldsmiths College, London University as a generalist teacher. He joined the teaching staff of Heath Clark School, Croydon, and in his spare time played in amateur musical ensembles. Among his fellow students at the college, and later his colleague in the amateur groups, was a string player, Joan Richardson. They married in 1939 when they were both 24. There was one son of the marriage.

Although he had no formal tuition as a clarinettist, Brymer maintained that nobody was entirely self-taught: &quot;I learnt from everyone I heard play. Frederick Thurston and Reginald Kell unwittingly betrayed their methods to me, but I also decided that I wanted to play in certain ways that they had never done. The ability to play the clarinet is the ability to overcome the imperfections of the instrument. There&#x27;s no such thing as a perfect clarinet, never was and never will be.&quot; Other clarinettists whose technique Brymer observed and learned from were Charles Draper and Haydn Draper. Brymer wrote of his predecessors, &quot;They would have been astounded at the things they taught me, without a penny piece changing hands.&quot;

During the Second World War Brymer served in the Royal Air Force. After his basic training he was promoted to corporal and posted to Morecambe on the north west coast of England as a physical training instructor. When not on RAF duty he frequently played in the Morecambe Central Pier dance band dressed in his corporal&#x27;s uniform. Among those he met in the Air Force was the horn player, Dennis Brain, who admired Brymer&#x27;s playing, and who later had a decisive influence on his career.

===Royal Philharmonic===
In 1946, Sir Thomas Beecham founded the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Among his principal players were Kell and Brain. The following year Kell announced his forthcoming resignation, and Brain suggested to Beecham that Brymer would be a suitable replacement. Brymer had returned to his teaching post after being demobilised from the RAF, and was incredulous at receiving a telephone call from Beecham inviting him to audition. Brymer&#x27;s first reaction was to think it was a practical joke, with one of his musical friends impersonating Beecham&#x27;s familiar lordly drawl. Having realised that it was indeed Beecham calling, Brymer accepted the invitation to audition. Having heard him play, Beecham appointed him to succeed Kell. [4] His first appearance with the RPO was a week of broadcasting with them in Berlioz&#x27;s opera &quot;The Trojans&quot;. Subsequently he had the good fortune to appear in Strauss&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot; with the composer present. Brymer recalled &quot;an old man in a raincoat leaning over my shoulder advising me of how to play the delicate clarinet solo which comes immediately after Don Quixote has died&quot;. – Richard Strauss in the last year of his life&quot;.[5] Many years later Brymer crossed swords with the conductor, Norman Del Mar over interpreting Strauss. A historian of the London Symphony Orchestra wrote, &quot;Rehearsing &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, Del Mar had the temerity to admonish Brymer for playing a phrase too loudly: &#x27;Just a memory, Jack, just a memory,&#x27; Del Mar called out. &#x27;Why are you playing it mezzo-forte?&#x27; &#x27;Because Strauss told me to,&#x27; Brymer retorted. &#x27;And I&#x27;m surprised that you don&#x27;t remember, Norman, because you were playing second horn at the time.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;The Times&quot; said of Brymer in this period, &quot;After his appointment to the RPO in 1947, the balding, affable Brymer was certainly Great Britain&#x27;s pre-eminent clarinettist, … whose mellifluous playing style and unruffled platform manner charmed even those usually impervious to classical music.&quot; In the RPO, Brymer joined Beecham&#x27;s starry line-up of wind players, Terence MacDonagh (oboe), Gerald Jackson (flute) and Gwydion Brooke (bassoon); collectively they became known to colleagues and audiences as &quot;the Royal Family&quot;. A clarinettist of a later generation, Alan Hacker, wrote that the sound produced by Brymer and his colleagues was &quot;expressive and instantly recognisable, even in just one solo note.&quot; With Beecham and the RPO, Brymer made the first of his three recordings of Mozart&#x27;s Clarinet Concerto in 1958. When the recording was reissued on compact disc in 2001, &quot;The American Record Guide&quot; said,
===BBC, LSO, chamber music and jazz===
After Beecham&#x27;s death in 1961 Brymer and other members of the RPO including MacDonagh became unhappy about the management of the RPO. The BBC&#x27;s controller of music, William Glock, invited Brymer and MacDonagh to move to the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Brymer was the orchestra&#x27;s co-principal clarinettist from 1963 to 1971. He also began to play more often in chamber music. When Pierre Boulez became chief conductor of the BBC SO in 1971, the sound he sought from his players, &quot;avant garde, harsher, more cutting in its edge&quot;, did not appeal to Brymer. He accepted an invitation to join the London Symphony Orchestra as co-principal with Gervase de Peyer. An example of Brymer&#x27;s sound in his LSO years can be heard in a 1972 recording of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Symphony No 2, conducted by André Previn. &quot;The Gramophone&quot; praised Brymer&#x27;s &quot;distinctively refined tone-colour … breathtakingly expressive&quot; in the slow movement.

In the classical chamber repertory, Brymer was associated with several groups. At various times in his career he was a founder-member of the Wigmore Ensemble, the Prometheus Ensemble and the London Baroque Ensemble. He was director of the London Wind Soloists, and a member of the Tuckwell Wind Quartet and the Robles Ensemble. Throughout his career Brymer enjoyed an interest in mainstream jazz. He performed as a soloist with many of the leading British and American jazz players of the post-war decades. When the RPO was in New Orleans on an American tour, Brymer improvised with local jazz stars, including Alphonse Picou.

===Teaching, recording, broadcasting and later years===
As a teacher, Brymer was professor at the Royal Academy of Music (1950–58), the Royal Military School of Music at Kneller Hall (1969–73), and the Guildhall School of Music (1981–93). Among his pupils at the Royal Academy was Alan Hacker, who like many players of the generation after Brymer was less attracted by the rich sound developed by Brymer, favouring instead more radical techniques propounded by Bruno Bartolozzi, and playing styles harking back to an earlier, less mellifluous, style of playing.
During his career Brymer made gramophone recordings of all Mozart&#x27;s works for wind solo and ensemble. Several works were written for him, including &quot;Three Pieces&quot; and a Clarinet Quintet by Cecil Armstrong Gibbs; Roundelay by Alan Richardson; and a Clarinet Concerto by Guy Woolfenden. Brymer was also a well-known broadcaster. His biographer, Raymond Holden, writes, &quot;his easy manner before the microphone meant that the radio programmes that he presented for the BBC, such as &#x27;At Home&#x27;, were popular favourites&quot;.

The LSO paid Brymer the unusual tribute of mounting a special concert to mark his 70th birthday, and another to mark his 75th. By the time of the latter he had retired from full-time orchestral playing, but he continued to perform, and played at a concert given by the English Chamber Orchestra to mark his 80th birthday, at which he played Mozart&#x27;s Clarinet Concerto and Clarinet Quintet, and Weber&#x27;s Clarinet Concerto No 1.

Brymer&#x27;s last public concert was on 18 July 1997 at the Wigmore Hall in London where he performed Mozart&#x27;s Clarinet Quintet with the Gabrieli Quartet. Before the performance, Brymer told the audience that the Quintet held a special importance for him and he thought it appropriate that this music should mark his farewell to the concert platform.

Brymer died in Redhill, Surrey at the age of 88. His ashes were interred a short distance away in the churchyard of St Peter&#x27;s, Limpsfield, close to the grave of Beecham.

<text>From the Earth to the Moon: A Direct Route in 97 Hours, 20 Minutes () is an 1865 novel by Jules Verne. It tells the story of the Baltimore Gun Club, a post-American Civil War society of weapons enthusiasts, and their attempts to build an enormous Columbiad space gun and launch three people – the Gun Club&#x27;s president, his Philadelphian armor-making rival, and a French poet – in a projectile with the goal of a Moon landing. Five years later, Verne wrote a sequel called &quot;Around the Moon&quot;. The 2 modern unabridged English translations were done by Walter James Miller in 1978 and Frederick Paul Walter in 2010.

==Background==
Verne&#x27;s novel was not the first literary work to recount a journey to the Moon; these include &quot;A True Story&quot;, by Lucian (second century AD), Francis Godwin&#x27;s &quot;The Man in the Moone&quot; (1638), the &quot;Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon&quot; (1657) by Cyrano de Bergerac, John Wilkins&#x27;s novel &quot;The Discovery of a World in the Moone&quot; of 1638, and &quot;Voyage de Milord Céton dans les sept planètes, ou Le nouveau Mentor&quot; by Marie-Anne Robert which appeared in Paris in 1756.

The story is notable in that Verne attempted to do some rough calculations as to the requirements for the cannon and in that, considering the comparative lack of empirical data on the subject at the time, some of his figures are remarkably accurate. However, his version of a space gun for a non-rocket spacelaunch turned out to be impractical for safe human space travel since a much longer barrel would have been required to reach escape velocity while limiting acceleration to survivable limits for the passengers.

The character of Michel Ardan, the French member of the party in the novel, was inspired by the real-life photographer Félix Nadar.

In 1889 Verne wrote a second sequel to the novel, &quot;The Purchase of the North Pole&quot;, which has the Gun Club members (led by J. T. Maston) plan to use the Columbiad to alter the tilt of the Earth to enable the mineral wealth of the Arctic region to be put within reach of exploitation.

==Plot==
The story opens some time after the end of the American Civil War. The Baltimore Gun Club, a society dedicated to the design of weapons of all kinds (especially cannons), comes together when Impey Barbicane, its president, calls them to support his latest idea. He&#x27;s done some calculations, and believes that they could construct a cannon capable of shooting a projectile to the Moon. After receiving the support of his companions, another meeting is held to decide the place from which the projectile will be fired, the dimensions and materials of both the cannon and the projectile, and which kind of powder they are to use.

An old enemy of Barbicane, a Captain Nicholl of Philadelphia, designer of plate armor, declares that the entire enterprise is absurd and makes a series of bets with Barbicane, each of them of increasing amount, over the impossibility of such a feat.

The first obstacle, enough money to construct the giant cannon (and against which Nicholl has bet $1,000), is raised from a number of countries in America and Europe. Notably, the U.S. donates four million dollars, whilst England, at first, does not give anything. In the end, nearly five and a half million dollars are raised, which ensures the financial feasibility of the project.

Stone&#x27;s Hill in &quot;Tampa Town&quot;, Florida is chosen as the site for the cannon&#x27;s construction. The Gun Club travels there and begins construction of the Columbiad cannon, which requires the excavation of a and circular hole, which is completed in the nick of time, but a surprise awaits Barbicane: Michel Ardan, a French adventurer, plans to travel to the Moon aboard the projectile.

During a meeting between Ardan, the Gun Club, and the inhabitants of Florida, Nicholl appears and challenges Barbicane to a duel. The duel is stopped when Ardan—having been warned by J. T. Maston, secretary of the Gun Club—meets the rivals in the forest where they have agreed to duel. Meanwhile, Barbicane finds the solution to the problem of surviving the incredible acceleration that the explosion would cause. Ardan suggests that Barbicane and Nicholl travel with him in the projectile, and his proposition is accepted.

In the end, the projectile is successfully launched, but the destinies of the three astronauts are left inconclusive. The sequel, &quot;Around the Moon&quot;, deals with what happens to the three men during their voyage from the Earth to the Moon.

==Influence on popular culture==
The novel was loosely the inspiration for the 1875 opera &quot;Le voyage dans la lune&quot;, music by Jacques Offenbach, without the permission of the author.

In 1880 &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; described Verne’s &quot;Columbiad&quot; as a &#x27;space-ship&#x27; – the first recorded use of this term in history.

In H. G. Wells&#x27; 1901 novel &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot; (also relating to the first voyagers to the Moon) the protagonist, Mr. Bedford, mentions Verne&#x27;s novel to his companion, Professor Cavor, but it is mentioned that Cavor is, &quot;not a reader of fiction&quot;. 

The novel (along with Wells&#x27; &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot;) inspired the first science fiction film, &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;, made in 1902 by Georges Méliès; in 1958, another film adaptation of the story was released, titled &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; and in 1967 became the basis for the very loose adaptation &quot;Jules Verne&#x27;s Rocket to the Moon&quot; (1967), a caper-style British comedy starring Burl Ives and Terry-Thomas. The 1961 Czechoslovak film &quot;The Fabulous Baron Munchausen&quot; combines characters and plot elements from the Verne novel with those of the stories of Baron Munchausen and Cyrano de Bergerac.

In March 1953, the Gilberton Company published a comic-book adaptation of &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; as issue No. 105 in its &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; series. An unidentified scriptwriter combined Verne&#x27;s &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; with the sequel, &quot;Around the Moon&quot;. Gilberton art director Alex A. Blum supplied both the cover painting and the 44 pages of interior art. The title went through twelve printings between 1953 and 1971.

During their return journey from the Moon, the crew of Apollo 11 made reference to Jules Verne&#x27;s book during a TV broadcast on 23 July, 1969. The mission&#x27;s commander, astronaut Neil Armstrong, said, &quot;A hundred years ago, Jules Verne wrote a book about a voyage to the Moon. His spaceship, Columbia , took off from Florida and landed in the Pacific Ocean after completing a trip to the Moon. It seems appropriate to us to share with you some of the reflections of the crew as the modern-day Columbia completes its rendezvous with the planet Earth and the same Pacific Ocean tomorrow.&quot;

In the 2010 &quot;The Quantum Thief&quot; trilogy, the protagonist enters an uneasy alliance with the &quot;Gun Club zoku&quot;, who specialize in military weaponry, and in &quot;The Causal Angel&quot; (2014) after escaping Earth using a nuclear-powered space gun, sells the &quot;Verne gun bullet&quot; to them as a unique collectible item; author Hannu Rajaniemi is a fan of Verne.

The Japanese anime adaption of the &quot;Space Brothers&quot; (2012–2014) opening for episodes 39-51 (&quot;Small World&quot; by Fujifabric) was a parody of the story, even ending with the cover of an early English translation. 

The first incarnation in 1995 of the roller coaster Space Mountain in Disneyland Paris, named &quot;Space Mountain: De la Terre à la Lune&quot;, was based loosely on the novel. The attraction&#x27;s exterior used a Verne era retro-futuristic influence, with a rivet and boiler plate effect and the &quot;Columbiad&quot;, which recoils with a bang and produces smoke as the train passes, giving riders the perception of being shot into space. In 1995 the BBC made a 44-minute documentary about the creation of Space Mountain, called &quot;Shoot for the Moon&quot;; Tim Delaney and his team were shown bringing the book to life.

<text>A loess (, ; from ) is a clastic, predominantly silt-sized sediment that is formed by the accumulation of wind-blown dust. Ten percent of Earth&#x27;s land area is covered by loesses or similar deposits.

A loess is a periglacial or aeolian (windborne) sediment, defined as an accumulation of 20% or less of clay with a balance of roughly equal parts sand and silt (with a typical grain size from 20 to 50 micrometers), often loosely cemented by calcium carbonate. Usually, they are homogeneous and highly porous and have vertical capillaries that permit the sediment to fracture and form vertical bluffs.

==Properties==
Loesses are ; porous; friable; pale yellow or buff; slightly ; typically, non-stratified; and often calcareous. Loess grains are angular, with little polishing or rounding, and composed of quartz, feldspar, mica, or other mineral crystals. Loesses have been described as rich, dust-like soil.

Loess deposits may become very thick: at more than a hundred meters in areas of Northwestern China and tens of meters in parts of the Midwestern United States. Loesses generally occur as blanket deposits that cover hundreds of square kilometers. The deposits are often tens of meters thick. Loesses often have steep or vertical faces. Because the grains are angular, loesses will often stand in banks for many years without slumping. This type of soil has &quot;vertical cleavage&quot;, and thus, it can be easily excavated to form cave dwellings, which is a popular method of making human habitations in some parts of China. However, loesses can readily erode.

In several areas of the world, loess ridges have formed that had been aligned with the prevailing winds during the last glacial maximum. These are called &quot;paha ridges&quot; in America and &quot;greda ridges&quot; in Europe. The formation of these loess dunes has been explained as a combination of wind and tundra conditions.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;loess&quot;, with connotations of origin by wind-deposited accumulation, was introduced into English from the German (1824), which can be traced back to Swiss German and is cognate with the English word &quot;loose&quot; and the German word . It was first applied to the Rhine River valley loesses around 1821.

==History of research==
The term &quot;Löß&quot; was first described in Central Europe by Karl Cäsar von Leonhard (1823–1824), who had reported yellowish brown, silty deposits along the Rhine valley near Heidelberg. Charles Lyell (1834) brought the term into widespread usage, observing similarities between &quot;loess&quot; and its derivatives along the loess bluffs in the Rhine and in Mississippi. At the time, it was thought that the yellowish brown silt-rich sediment was of fluvial origin and had been deposited by large rivers. The aeolian origin of the loesses was recognized later (Virlet D&#x27;Aoust 1857), particularly due to the convincing observations of loesses in China by Ferdinand von Richthofen (1878). A tremendous number of papers have been published since then, focusing on the formation of loesses and on loess/paleosol (older soil buried under deposits) sequences as the archives of climate and environment change. These water conservation works have been carried out extensively in China, and the research of loesses in China has been ongoing since 1954. [33]

Much effort was put into setting up regional and local loess stratigraphies and their correlations (Kukla 1970, 1975, 1977). However, even the chronostratigraphical position of the last interglacial soil correlating with marine isotope substage 5e was a matter of debate, due to the lack of robust and reliable numerical dating, as summarized, for example, by Zöller et al. (1994) and Frechen et al. (1997) for the Austrian and Hungarian loess stratigraphy, respectively.

Since the 1980s, thermoluminescence (TL), optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) dating have been available, providing the possibility for dating the time of loess (dust) depositions, i.e., the time elapsed since the last exposure of the mineral grains to daylight. During the past decade, luminescence dating has significantly improved by new methodological improvements, especially the development of single regenerative (SAR) protocols (Murray &amp; Wintle 2000) resulting in reliable ages (or age estimates) with an accuracy of up to 5 and 10% for the last glacial record. More recently, luminescence dating has also become a robust dating technique for penultimate and antepenultimate glacial loess (e.g. Thiel et al. 2011, Schmidt et al. 2011) allowing for a reliable correlation of loess/palaeosol sequences for at least the last two interglacial/glacial cycles throughout Europe and the Northern Hemisphere (Frechen 2011). Furthermore, the numerical dating provides the basis for quantitative loess research applying more sophisticated methods to determine and understand high-resolution proxy data including the palaeodust content of the atmosphere, variations of the atmospheric circulation patterns and wind systems, palaeoprecipitation, and palaeotemperature.

Besides luminescence dating methods, the use of radiocarbon dating in loess has increased during the past decades. Advances in methods of analyses, instrumentation, and refinements to the radiocarbon calibration curve have made it possible to obtain reliable ages from loess deposits for the last 40–45 ka. However, the use of this method relies on finding suitable in situ organic material in deposits such as charcoal, seeds, earthworm granules, or snail shells.

==Formation==

According to Pye (1995), four fundamental requirements are necessary for the formation of loess: a dust source, adequate wind energy to transport the dust, a suitable accumulation area, and a sufficient amount of time.

===Periglacial loess===
Periglacial (glacial) loess is derived from the floodplains of glacial braided rivers that carried large volumes of glacial meltwater and sediments from the annual melting of continental ice sheets and mountain ice caps during the spring and summer. During the autumn and winter, when the melting of the ice sheets and ice caps ceased, the flow of meltwater down these rivers either ceased or was greatly reduced. As a consequence, large parts of the formerly submerged and unvegetated floodplains of these braided rivers dried out and were exposed to the wind. Because the floodplains consist of sediment containing a high content of glacially ground flour-like silt and clay, they were highly susceptible to winnowing of their silts and clays by the wind. Once entrained by the wind, particles were then deposited downwind. The loess deposits found along both sides of the Mississippi River alluvial valley are a classic example of periglacial loess.

During the Quaternary, loess and loess-like sediments were formed in periglacial environments on mid-continental shield areas in Europe and Siberia as well as on the margins of high mountain ranges like in Tajikistan and on semi-arid margins of some lowland deserts as in China.

In England, periglacial loess is also known as brickearth.

===Non-glacial===
Non-glacial loess can originate from deserts, dune fields, playa lakes, and volcanic ash.

Some types of nonglacial loess are:
* Desert loess produced by aeolian attrition of quartz grains; 
* Volcanic loess in Ecuador and Argentina;
* Tropical loess in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay;
* Gypsum loess in Spain;
* Trade wind loess in Venezuela and Brazil;
* Anticyclonic loess in Argentina.

The thick Chinese loess deposits are non-glacial loess having been blown in from deserts in northern China. The loess covering the Great Plains of Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado is considered to be non-glacial desert loess. Non-glacial desert loess is also found in Australia and Africa.

==Fertility==
Loess tends to develop into very rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, it is some of the most agriculturally productive terrain in the world.

Soils underlain by loess tend to be excessively drained. The fine grains weather rapidly due to their large surface area, making soils derived from loess rich. The fertility of loess soils is due largely to a high cation exchange capacity (the ability of the soil to retain nutrients) and porosity (the air-filled space in the soil). The fertility of loess is not due to organic matter content, which tends to be rather low, unlike tropical soils which derive their fertility almost wholly from organic matter.

Even well managed loess farmland can experience dramatic erosion of well over 2.5 kg/m2 per year. In China, the loess deposits which give the Yellow River its color have been farmed and have produced phenomenal yields for over one thousand years. Winds pick up loess particles contributing to the Asian Dust pollution problem. The largest deposit of loess in the United States which is the Loess Hills along the border of Iowa and Nebraska, has survived intensive farming and poor farming practices. For almost 150 years, this loess deposit was farmed with mouldboard ploughs and tilled in the fall, both intensely erosive practices. At times it suffered erosion rates of over 10 kilograms per square meter per year. Today this loess deposit is worked as low till or no till in all areas and is aggressively terraced.

==Large areas of loess deposits and soils==
=== Central Asia ===
An area of multiple loess deposits spans from southern Tajikistan up to Almaty, Kazakhstan.

=== East Asia ===
====China====

The Loess Plateau (), also known as the Huangtu Plateau, is a plateau that covers an area of some 640,000 km2 around the upper and middle reaches of China&#x27;s Yellow River. The Yellow River was so named because the loess forming its banks gave a yellowish tint to the water. The soil of this region has been called the &quot;most highly erodible soil on earth&quot;. The Loess Plateau and its dusty soil cover almost all of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces; the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and parts of others.

=== Europe ===
Loess deposits of varying thickness (decimeter to several tens of meters) are widely distributed over the European continent. The northern European loess belt stretches from southern England and northern France to Germany, Poland and the southern Ukraine and deposits are characterized by strong influences of periglacial conditions. South-eastern European loess is mainly deposited in plateau-like situations in the Danube basins, likely derived from the Danube River system. In south-western Europe, relocated loess derivatives are mostly restricted to the Ebro Valley and central Spain.

===North America===
====United States====
The Loess Hills of Iowa owe their fertility to the prairie topsoils built by 10,000 years of post-glacial accumulation of organic-rich humus as a consequence of a persistent grassland biome. When the valuable A-horizon topsoil is eroded or degraded, the underlying loess soil is infertile and requires the addition of fertilizer to support agriculture.

The loess along the Mississippi River near Vicksburg, Mississippi, consists of three layers. The &quot;Peoria Loess&quot;, &quot;Sicily Island Loess&quot;, and &quot;Crowley&#x27;s Ridge Loess&quot; accumulated at different periods during the Pleistocene. Ancient soils, called paleosols, have developed on the top of the Sicily Island Loess and Crowley&#x27;s Ridge Loess. The lowermost loess, the Crowley&#x27;s Ridge Loess, accumulated during the late Illinoian Stage. The middle loess, Sicily Island Loess, accumulated during the early Wisconsin Stage. The uppermost loess, the Peoria Loess, in which the modern soil has developed, accumulated during the late Wisconsin Stage. Animal remains include terrestrial gastropods and mastodons.

===Oceania===
====New Zealand====
Extensive areas of loess occur in New Zealand including the Canterbury Plains and on the Banks Peninsula. The basis of loess stratigraphy was introduced by John Hardcastle in 1890.

===South America===
====Argentina====

Much of Argentina is covered by loess. Two areas of loess are usually distinguished in Argentina: the neotropical loess north of latitude 30° S and the pampean loess.

The neotropical loess is made of silt or silty clay. Relative to the pampean loess the neotropical loess is poor in quartz and calcium carbonate. The source region for this loess is thought by some scientists to be areas of fluvio-glacial deposits the Andean foothills formed by the Patagonian Ice Sheet. Other researchers stress the importance of volcanic material in the neotropical loess.

The pampean loess is sandy or made of silty sand.

<text>The bowfin (Amia calva) is a ray-finned fish native to North America. Common names include mudfish, mud pike, dogfish, grindle, grinnel, swamp trout, and choupique. It is regarded as a relict, being one of only two surviving species of the Halecomorphi, a group of fish that first appeared during the Early Triassic, around 250 million years ago. The bowfin is often considered a &quot;living fossil&quot; because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors. It is one of two species in the genus &quot;Amia,&quot; along with &quot;Amia ocellicauda&quot;, the eyespot bowfin. The closest living relatives of bowfins are gars, with the two groups being united in the clade Holostei.

Bowfins are demersal freshwater piscivores, commonly found throughout much of the eastern United States, and in southern Ontario and Quebec. Fossil deposits indicate Amiiformes were once widespread in both freshwater and marine environments across North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Now, their range is limited to much of the eastern United States and adjacent southern Canada, including the drainage basins of the Mississippi River, Great Lakes, and various rivers exiting in the Eastern Seaboard or Gulf of Mexico. Their preferred habitat includes vegetated sloughs, lowland rivers and lakes, swamps, and backwater areas; they are also occasionally found in brackish water. They are stalking, ambush predators known to move into the shallows at night to prey on fish and aquatic invertebrates such as crawfish, mollusks, and aquatic insects.

Like gars, bowfin are bimodal breathers—they have the capacity to breathe both water and air. Their gills exchange gases in the water allowing them to breathe, but they also have a gas bladder that serves to maintain buoyancy, and also allows them to breathe air by means of a small pneumatic duct connected from the foregut to the gas bladder. They can break the surface to gulp air, which allows them to survive conditions of aquatic hypoxia that would be lethal to most other species. The bowfin is long-lived, with age up to 33 years reported.

==Morphology==
The typical length of a bowfin is ; females typically grow to , males to . They can reach in length, and weigh . Young of the year typically grow to by October. Females tend to grow larger than males.
The body of the bowfin is elongated and cylindrical, with the sides and back olive to brown in color, often with vertical bars and dark reticulations or another camouflaged pattern. The dorsal fin has horizontal bars, and the caudal fin has irregular vertical bars. The underside is white or cream, and the paired fins and anal fin are bright green. During larval stage, hatchlings from about total length are black and tadpole-like in appearance. At approximately total length they have been described as looking like miniature placoderms. They grow quickly, and typically leave the nest within 4 to 6 weeks after hatching. Young males have a black eyespot on the base of the tail (caudal peduncle) that is commonly encircled by an orange-yellowish border, while the female&#x27;s is black, if present at all. It is thought the purpose of the eyespot is to confuse predators, deflecting attacks away from the head of the fish to its tail, which affords the bowfin an opportunity to escape predation. The bowfin is so named for its long, undulating dorsal fin consisting of 145 to 250 rays that runs from the middle of the back to the base of the tail.

The skull of the bowfin is made of two layers of skull, the dermatocranium and the chondrocranium. The chondrocranium layer cannot be seen because it is located below the dermal bones. The bowfin skull is made up of 28 fused bones, which compose the dermatocranium. The roof of the mouth is made up of three bones, the ectopterygoid, the palantine, and the vomer. They have two sets of teeth, including one set of larger sharp teeth coming out of the mandibular and premaxillary bones to grasp and control the prey. The other set of teeth, located posteriorly and connected to the hyomandibular bone, is made up of pharyngeal tooth patches, which are used for sorting out nutrients and grinding down larger pieces of food. &quot; &quot;Another three bones make up the lower jaw: the dentary, the angular, and the surangular. The cranial surface of the skull is made up of the nasals, the antorbital, the lacrimal, the parietal, the intertemporal, the post parietal, the supratemporal, the extra scapular, the post temporal, and the opercular. The entirety of the skull is attached to the girdle through another set of bones.


Bowfin are often referred to as &quot;living fossils&quot; or &quot;primitive fish&quot; because they retained some of the primitive characters common to their ancestors, including a modified (rounded externally) heterocercal caudal fin, a highly vascularized gas bladder lung, vestiges of a spiral valve, and a bony gular plate. The bony gular plate is located underneath the head on the exterior of the lower jaw between the two sides of the lower jaw bone. Other distinguishing characteristics include long, sharp teeth, and two protruding tube-like nostrils. Unlike all of the most primitive actinopterygians, the scales of bowfin differ in that they are not ganoid scales, rather they are large, single-layered cycloid scales closer in similarity to more derived teleosts.
===Fish similar in appearance===
Northern snakeheads (&quot;Channa argus&quot;) are commonly mistaken for bowfin because of similarities in appearance, most noticeably their elongated, cylindrical shape, and long dorsal fin that runs along their backs. Northern snakeheads are piscivorous fish native to the rivers and estuaries of China, Russia, and Korea that have been introduced and become established in parts of North America. However, unlike bowfin which are native to North America, the northern snakehead is considered an invasive species and environmentally harmful there. Some contrasting differences in bowfin include a black eyespot on their caudal peduncle, a tan and olive coloration, a shorter anal fin, a more rounded head, pelvic fins at a greater distance from the pectoral fins than in the northern snakehead and the presence of the gular plate on the ventral side of the lower jaw. Another noticeable difference is that bowfin scales do not continue uniformly from their body to their head. Bowfin heads are smooth and free of scales, whereas the northern snakehead has scales that uniformly continue from their body through to their head.

The burbot (&quot;Lota lota&quot;), a predatory fish native to streams and lakes of North America and Eurasia, is also commonly mistaken for bowfin. Burbots can be distinguished by their flat head and chin barbel, long anal fin, and pelvic fins situated beneath the pectoral fins.

==Bowfin body-shape evolution and development==
The first fish lacked jaws and used negative pressure to suck their food in through their mouths. The jaw in the bowfin is a result of their evolutionary need to be able to catch and eat bigger and more nutritious prey. As a result of being able to gather more nutrients, Bowfin are able to live a more active lifestyle. The jaw of a bowfin has several adaptations. The maxilla and premaxilla are fused and the posterior chondrocranium articulates with the vertebra which allows the jaw freedom to rotate. The suspensorium includes several bones and articulates with the snout, brain case, and the mandible. When the jaw opens epaxial muscles lift the chondrocranium, which is attached to the upper jaw, while adductor muscles act to close the lower jaw. This ability to open and close the jaw helps the bowfin to be an active predator that can catch bigger prey and digest them.

The vertebral column in bowfin is ossified and in comparison to earlier fish, the are the major support for the body, whereas in earlier fish the notochord was the main form of support. In bowfin neural spines and ribs also increase in prominence, an evolutionary aspect that helps provide additional support and stabilize unpaired fins. The evolution of the vertebral column allows the bowfin to withstand lateral bending that puts the column under compression without breaking. This, in turn, allows the bowfin to have more controlled and powerful movements, in comparison to fish that had only a notochord. The bowfin has a rounded heterocercal tail that resembles a homocercal tail. This type of tail gives the body a streamlined shape which allows the bowfin to improve its swimming ability by reducing drag. These types of tails are common in fish with gas bladders, because the bladder supplies the fish with natural buoyancy.

The bowfin is a member of actinopterygii which means that the pectoral girdle is partly endochondral but mostly dermal bone. In this group of fish the fins function to maneuver, brake, and for slight positional adjustments. The pectoral girdle of the bowfin has six parts. The post temporal, supracleithrum, postcleithrum, cleithrum, scapulacoracoid, and the clavicle make up the pectoral girdle. The pectoral girdle is attached to the skull. The paired pectoral and pelvic fins of fish are homologous with the limbs of tetrapods.

==Physiology==

Bowfin are physostomes, meaning they have a small &quot;pneumatic duct&quot; that connects their swim bladders to their digestrive tract. This allows them, like lungfish, to &quot;breath&quot; in two ways: they can extract oxygen from the water when breathing through their gills, but can also break the water&#x27;s surface to breathe or gulp air through the pneumatic duct. When performing low-level physical activity, bowfin obtain more than half of their oxygen from breathing air. The fish have two distinct air-breathing mechanisms used to ventilate the gas bladder. Air breathing &quot;type I&quot; is consistent with the action of exhale / inhale exchange, stimulated by either air or water hypoxia, to regulate gas exchange; &quot;type II&quot; air breaths are inhalation alone, which is believed to regulate gas bladder volume, to control buoyancy. Bimodal respiration helps bowfin survive and maintain their metabolic rate in hypoxic (low-oxygen) conditions. Bowfin air breath more frequently when they are in darkness, and correspondingly more active.

Bowfin blood can adapt to warm, acidic waters. The fish becomes inactive in waters below ; at this temperature they breathe almost no air; however, with increasing temperature their air breathing increases. Their preferred temperature range is between , with the temperature of maximum activity. Air breathing is at a maximum in the range . Bowfin do not use central chemoreceptor regulation for respiration control. Experiments manipulating the oxygen content, carbon dioxide content, and pH of bowfin extradural fluid did not affect breathing rate, heart rate, or blood pressure pointing to a lack of central chemoreceptor regulation. Instead, bowfin respiratory patterns respond to water oxygen content and water temperature, as water temperatures play a role in oxygen content. In the lab, bowfin showed an increase in the breathing rate when the temperatures were raised above 10°C. Bowfin also showed an increase in breathing rate when exposed to lower oxygen levels in the water.

Herpetologist W. T. Neill reported in 1950 that he unearthed a bowfin aestivating (in a dormant state) in a chamber below the ground surface, in diameter, from a river. It was further noted that flood levels had previously reached the area, and receded. It is not unusual for riverine species like bowfin to move into backwaters with flood currents, and become trapped when water levels recede. While aestivation is anecdotally documented by multiple researchers, laboratory experiments have suggested instead that bowfin are physiologically incapable of surviving more than three to five days of air exposure. However, no field manipulation has been performed. Regardless of the lack of evidence confirming the bowfin&#x27;s ability to aestivate, it has been noted that bowfin can survive prolonged conditions of exposure to air because they have the ability to breathe air. Their gill filaments and lamellae are rigid in structure which helps prevent the lamellae from collapsing and aids gas exchange even during air exposure.

==Evolution and phylogeny==
Competing hypotheses and debates continue over the evolution of &quot;Amia&quot; and relatives, including their relationship among basal extant teleosts, and organization of clades. Bowfin are the last remaining member of Halecomorphi, a group that includes many extinct species in several families. Halecomorphs were generally accepted as the sister group to Teleostei but not without question. While a halecostome pattern of neopterygian clades was produced in morphology-based analyses of extant actinopterygians, a different result was produced with fossil taxa which showed a monophyletic Holostei. Monophyletic Holostei were also recovered by at least two nuclear gene analyses, in an independent study of fossil and extant fish, and in an analysis of ultraconserved genomic elements.

The extant ray-finned fish of the subclass Actinopterygii include 42 orders, 431 families and over 23,000 species. They are currently classified into two infraclasses, Chondrostei (holosteans) and Neopterygii (teleost fishes). Sturgeons, paddlefish, bichirs and reed fish compose the thirty-eight species of chondrosteans, and are considered relict species. Included in the over 23,000 species of neopterygians are eight relict species comprising gars and the bowfin.

===Infraclass Neopterygii===
Neopterygians are the second major occurrence in the evolution of ray-finned fish and today include the majority of modern bony fish. They are distinguished from their earlier ancestors by major changes to the jaws, shape of the skull, and tail. They are divided into three divisions:
* Division 1. Order Lepisosteiformes – the relict gars which include extant species of gars that first appeared in the Cretaceous.
* Division 2. Order Amiiformes – the relict bowfin, (halecomorphids), the only extant species in the order Amiiformes which date back to the Triassic period.
* Division 3. Division Teleostei – the stem group of Teleostei from which modern fish arose, including most of the bony fish we are familiar with today.

===Species===
The following is a species list
===Genome evolution===
The bowfin genome contains an intact ParaHox gene cluster, similar to the bichir and to most other vertebrates. This is in contrast, however, with teleost fish, which have a fragmented ParaHox cluster, probably because of a whole genome duplication event in their lineage. The presence of an intact ParaHox gene cluster suggests that bowfin ancestors separated from other fish before the last common ancestor of all teleosts appeared. Bowfin are thus possibly a better model to study vertebrate genome organization than common teleost model organisms such as zebrafish.

==Feeding behavior==

Bowfin are stalking, ambush predators that customarily move into the shallows at night to prey on fish, amphibians, and aquatic invertebrates such as crawfish, other crustaceans, mollusks, and aquatic insects. Young bowfin feed mostly on small crustaceans, while adults are mostly piscivorous, but also known to be opportunistic. Some common examples of prey include frogs, bass, other bowfin, dragonflies, sunfish, crawfish, etc. Bowfin are remarkably agile, can move quickly through the water, and they have a voracious appetite. Their undulating dorsal fin propels them silently through the water while stalking their prey. The attack is straightforward and swift with a movement that lasts approximately 0.075 seconds. There were also some studies regarding the capacity of the bowfin to survive without food. In 1916, a female bowfin was starved for twenty months. It was the longest period that any vertebrate had been without food, as far the writer was aware during the observation. Some independent studies focus on the bowfin&#x27;s ability to use organic material as a source of food and studied the structure of the gill raker. They concluded that it did not benefit from the organic material in the water because the gill rakers were short with blunt processes and a short space between them. Even bacteria could enter and exit through the gill easily. Its structure alone indicated that the &quot;Amia&quot; do not use microorganisms as a source of food.

==Distribution and habitat==
Fossil deposits indicate amiiforms included freshwater and marine species that were once widely distributed in North America, South America, Eurasia and Africa. Today, bowfin (&quot;Amia calva&quot;) are the only remaining species in the order Amiiformes; they are demersal freshwater piscivores, and their range is restricted to freshwater environments in North America, including much of the eastern United States and adjacent southern Canada from the St. Lawrence River and Lake Champlain drainage of southern Ontario and Quebec westward around the Great Lakes in southern Ontario into Minnesota.

Historically, their distribution in North America included the drainage basins of the Mississippi River from Quebec to northern Minnesota, the St. Lawrence-Great Lakes, including Georgian Bay, Lake Nipissing and Simcoe, Ontario, south to the Gulf of Mexico; Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain from the Susquehanna River drainage in southeastern Pennsylvania to the Colorado River in Texas.

===Stocking===
Research from the late 1800s to the 1980s suggests a trend of intentional stockings of non-indigenous fish into ponds, lakes and rivers in the United States. At that time, little was known about environmental impacts, or long-term effects of new species establishment and spread as a result of &quot;fish rescue and transfer&quot; efforts, or the importance of nongame fish to the ecological balance of aquatic ecosystems. Introductions of bowfin to areas they were considered a non-indigenous species included various lakes, rivers and drainages in Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Many of the introductions were intentional stockings; however, there is no way to positively determine distribution resulting from flood transfers, or other inadvertent migrations. Bowfin are typically piscivorous, but as an introduced species are capable of being voracious predators that pose a threat to native fish and their prey.

===Preferred habitat===
Bowfin prefer vegetated sloughs, lowland rivers and lakes, swamps, backwater areas, and are occasionally found in brackish water. They are well camouflaged, and not easy to spot in slow water with abundant vegetation. They often seek shelter under roots, and submerged logs. Oxygen-poor environments can be tolerated because of their ability to breathe air.

==Life cycle==
Bowfin spawn in the spring or early summer, typically between April and June, more commonly at night in abundantly vegetated, clear shallow water in weed beds over sand bars, and also under stumps, logs, and bushes.
Optimum temperatures for nesting and spawning range between . The males construct circular nests in fibrous root mats, clearing away leaves and stems. Depending on the density of surrounding vegetation there may be a tunnel-like entrance at one side. The diameter of the nests commonly range between , at a water depth of .

During spawning season, the fins and underside of male bowfin often change in color to a bright lime green. The courtship/spawning sequence lasts one to three hours, and can repeat up to five times. Courtship begins when a female approaches the nest. The ritual consists of intermittent nose bites, nudges, and chasing behavior by the male until the female becomes receptive, at which time the pair lie side by side in the nest. She deposits her eggs while he shakes his fins in a vibratory movement, and releases his milt for fertilization to occur. A male often has eggs from more than one female in his nest, and a single female often spawns in several nests.

Females vacate the nest after spawning, leaving the male behind to protect the eggs during the eight to ten days of incubation. A nest may contain 2,000 to 5,000 eggs, possibly more. Fecundity is usually related to size of the fish, so it is not unusual for the roe of a large gravid female to contain over 55,000 eggs. Bowfin eggs are adhesive, and will attach to aquatic vegetation, roots, gravel, and sand. After hatching, larval bowfin do not swim actively in search of food. During the seven to nine days required for yolk-sac absorption, they attach to vegetation by means of an adhesive organ on their snout, and remain protected by the parent male bowfin. Bowfin aggressively protect their spawn from the first day of incubation to a month or so after the eggs have hatched. When the fry are able to swim and forage on their own, they will form a school and leave the nest accompanied by the parent male bowfin who slowly circles them to prevent separation.

Bowfin reach sexually maturity at two to three years of age. They can live up to 33 years in the wild, and 30 years in captivity. Bowfin may live decades at adult size.

==Diseases==

A common parasite of bowfin is the anchor worm (&quot;Lernaea&quot;). These small crustaceans infest the skin and bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death. The mollusk &quot;Megalonaias gigantea&quot; lays eggs in the bowfin gills, that are then externally fertilized by sperm passing in the water flow. The small glochidia larvae then hatch and develop in the gill tubes.

Bowfin with liver cancer and with fatal leukemia have been reported.

==Utilization==

As a sport fish, bowfin are not considered desirable to many anglers. They were once considered a nuisance fish by anglers and early biologists who believed the bowfin&#x27;s predatory nature was harmful to sport fish populations. As a result, efforts were taken to reduce their numbers. Research has since proven otherwise, and that knowledge together with a better understanding of maintaining overall balance of ecosystems, regulations were introduced to help protect and maintain viable populations of bowfin. Bowfin are strong fighters, a prized trait in game fish. However, they do have a jaw full of sharp teeth which requires careful handling. The current tackle record is 

Bowfin were once considered to have little commercial value because of its poor-tasting meat which has been referred to as &quot;soft, bland-tasting and of poor texture&quot;. However, it is considered quite palatable if cleaned properly and smoked, or prepared fried, blackened, used in courtbouillion, or in fishballs or fishcakes. Over the years, global efforts have imposed strict regulations on the international trade of caviar, particularly on the harvest of sturgeons from the Caspian Sea where the highly prized caviar from the beluga sturgeon originates. The bans imposed on Caspian sturgeons have created lucrative markets for affordable substitutes in the United States including paddlefish, bowfin, and various species of sturgeon. In Louisiana, bowfin are harvested in the wild, and cultured commercially in hatcheries for their meat and roe. The roe is processed into caviar, and sold as &quot;Cajun caviar&quot;, or marketed under the trade name &quot;Choupiquet Royale&quot;.

==Accumulation of toxic substances==
In some areas of the United States where aquatic environments have tested positive for elevated levels of toxins, such as mercury, arsenic, chromium, and copper, there are posted signs with warnings about the consumption of fish caught in those areas. Concentration of mercury biomagnifies as it passes up the food chain from organisms on lower trophic levels to apex predators. It bioaccumulates in the tissues of larger, long-lived predatory fish. When compared to smaller, short-lived fish, bowfin tend to concentrate mercury at higher levels thereby making them less safe for human consumption.

<text>The Amiiformes order of fish has only two extant species, the bowfins: &quot;Amia calva&quot; and &quot;Amia ocellicauda&quot;, the latter recognized as a separate species in 2022. These Amiiformes are found in the freshwater systems of North America, in the United States and parts of southern Canada. They live in freshwater streams, rivers, and swamps. The order first appeared in the Triassic, and the extinct members include both marine and freshwater species, many of which are morphologically disparate from bowfins, such as the caturids. 

==Evolution and diversity==
The extinct species of the Amiiformes can be found as fossils in Asia and Europe, but the bowfin is the last living species in the order. Amiiformes is therefore the last surviving order of Halecomorphi, the clade to which the bowfin and its fossil relatives belong. Other orders, such as the Parasemionotiformes, are all extinct.

Halecomorphs, and its sister group Ginglymodi, belong to Holostei. Holosteans are the sister group of teleosteans, the group to which nearly all (i.e., 96%) living fishes belong to. Holosteans and Teleosts form a clade called Neopterygii. The following cladogram summarizes the evolutionary relationships of living and fossil Halecomorphs, and other neopterygians.
Possible specimens of caturoids are known from the Late Triassic, with the earliest unambiguous members being known from the Early Jurassic. Amiiformes had spread to North America and Africa by the end of the Middle Jurassic, reaching an apex of diversity during the Early Cretaceous, during the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic, the group declined until only a single genus, &quot;Amia&quot;, containing the bowfin remained.

<text>The Daqin Pagoda () is a Buddhist pagoda in Zhouzhi County of Xi&#x27;an (formerly Chang&#x27;an), Shaanxi Province, China, located about two kilometres to the west of Louguantai temple. The pagoda has been claimed as a Church of the East in China church from the Tang dynasty but there has been no conclusive evidence of such a connection.

==Etymology==
Daqin is the ancient Chinese name for the Roman Empire or, depending on context, the Near East, especially Syria.

==History==
The Daqin Pagoda is first attested in 1065, when the Chinese poet Su Dongpo visited it and wrote a well-known poem about it, &quot;Daqin Temple&quot;. His younger brother Su Zhe also wrote an &quot;echoing&quot; poem referring to the monks at the temple. An earthquake severely damaged the pagoda in 1556 and it was finally abandoned. Due to the earthquake, many of the underground chambers of the complex are no longer reachable.

==Features==
The seven-storeyed octagonal brick pagoda is about 34 meters high (was thought to be 32 in the past). Each side of the first storey measures 4.3 meters.

==Speculation about Christianity==
The Daqin Pagoda was visited by Assyrian Church of the East bishop Mar Awa Royel in 2012 as part of a follow-up visit to China in 2010, upon invitation from the Jingjiao Fellowship and director Mr. David Tam.

In 2001 the pagoda was claimed by Martin Palmer, the translator of several popular books on sinology, including Zhuangzi and &quot;I Ching&quot;, as a form of Christianity from the Tang dynasty, in his controversial book &quot;The Jesus Sutras&quot;. According to Palmer, the church and the monastery were built in 640 by early Church of the East missionaries. &quot;Daqin&quot; is the name for the Roman Empire in the early Chinese-language documents of the 1st and 2nd centuries; by the mid-9th century it was also used to refer to the mission churches of the Syriac Christians.

Supporters of Palmer&#x27;s claims have drawn attention to details which suggest that the monastery was earlier a Christian church, including a supposed depiction of Jonah at the walls of Nineveh, a nativity scene (depiction of the birth of Jesus) and Syriac graffiti. The east-facing orientation of the complex is also advanced as evidence of its Christian origin since Chinese Daoist and Buddhist temple complexes face north or south.

As a potential stimulus to the district&#x27;s tourist trade, Palmer&#x27;s claims have been given wide publicity by the local authorities but have also received approbation by Chinese academics. The exterior of the pagoda and its surroundings were featured in the first episode of the 2009 BBC program &quot;A History of Christianity&quot;. The program also featured an interview with Palmer by the presenter Professor Diarmaid MacCulloch.

Despite the publicity they have received, Palmer&#x27;s claims are controversial, and have been dismissed by Michael Keevak, the author of &quot;The Story of a Stele&quot;, and by David Wilmshurst, the author of &quot;The Martyred Church: A History of the Church of the East&quot;.

James Morris of the University of St. Andrews has stated of the pagoda that &quot;until more detailed archaeological analysis of the site is undertaken [...] we must be content in maintaining that there are no proven direct archaeological remains for the presence of Christianity during the &quot;Táng&quot; period.&quot;

<text>An appellation is a legally defined and protected geographical indication primarily used to identify where the grapes for a wine were grown, although other types of food often have appellations as well. Restrictions other than geographical boundaries, such as what grapes may be grown, maximum grape yields, alcohol level, and other quality factors may also apply before an appellation name may legally appear on a wine bottle label. The rules that govern appellations are dependent on the country in which the wine was produced.

==History==
The tradition of wine appellation is very old. The oldest references are to be found in the Bible, where &quot;wine of Samaria&quot;, &quot;wine of Carmel&quot;, &quot;wine of Jezreel&quot;, or &quot;wine of Helbon&quot; are mentioned. This tradition of appellation continued throughout the Antiquity and the Middle Ages, though without any officially sanctioned rules. Historically, the world&#x27;s first exclusive (protected) vineyard zone was introduced in Chianti, Italy in 1716 and the first wine classification system in Tokaj-Hegyalja, Hungary, in 1730.

==Europe==

===France===
In 1935, the Institut National des Appellations d&#x27;Origine (INAO), a branch of the French Ministry of Agriculture, was created to manage wine-processing in France. In the Rhone wine region Baron Pierre Le Roy Boiseaumarié, a lawyer and winegrower from Châteauneuf-du-Pape, obtained legal recognition of the Côtes du Rhône appellation of origin in 1937. The AOC seal, or Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée, was created and mandated by French laws in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.

Before 1935, despite the fact that the INAO was yet to be created, champagne enjoyed an appellation control by virtue of legal protection as part of the Treaty of Madrid. The treaty stated that only sparkling wine produced in Champagne and adhering to the standards defined for that name as an Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée could be called champagne. This right was reaffirmed in the Treaty of Versailles after World War I.

===Germany===
Germany is unusual among wine-producing countries in that its most prestigious classifications, the various grades of Prädikatswein, are based on the ripeness of the grapes, though their geographical origins are also legally defined. Thus Germany&#x27;s geographical classification, Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (QbA), is akin to France&#x27;s defunct Vin Délimité de Qualité Superieure, which has been subsumed into the current Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée system.

===Georgia===
Georgia has 24 registered wine appellations.

===Hungary===
Historically, the world&#x27;s first vineyard classification system was introduced in Tokaj-Hegyalja, Hungary, in 1730.
Vineyards were classified into three categories depending on the soil, sun exposure, and potential to develop &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot;. The subdivisions were: first-class, second-class and third-class wines. A decree by the Habsburg crown in 1757 established a closed production district in Tokaj. The classification system was completed by the national censuses of 1765 and 1772.

===Italy===
Italy&#x27;s first origin classification system was introduced in Tuscany in 1716 for delimiting Chianti production. After the unification of Italy several attempts were made to introduce some kind of protection for wine appellations, to no avail. Only in 1963 the &quot;&quot; law was approved, starting with 1967 vintage.

===Portugal===
The world&#x27;s third-oldest appellation control, after Chianti and Tokaj, was introduced in Portugal in 1756, pertaining to port wine, which was produced in the region of the Douro valley.

===Spain===
Some Spanish wines were already famous or even regulated (Rioja: 1925; Sherry: 1933) when the market started being regulated. It was not until 1980 that legislation on was stablished, following the French scheme with more tiers of classification and prompted by the impending accession to the European Union.

==North America==

===Canada===

Canadian wine appellations are regulated by the Vintners Quality Alliance system. The system covers the provinces of British Columbia and Ontario.

British Columbia is divided into four &quot;Designated Viticultural Areas&quot; (&quot;DVAs&quot;): Okanagan Valley, Vancouver Island, Fraser Valley, and the Similkameen Valley. Ontario includes three DVAs: Niagara Peninsula, Lake Erie North Shore, and Prince Edward County.

On June 11, 2012, Nova Scotia launched its first appellation, Tidal Bay.

===United States===

The American Viticultural Area (&quot;AVA&quot;) is for the United States. The only requirement to use an AVA name on the wine label is that 85% of the wine must have come from grapes grown within the geographical AVA boundaries. The first AVA was in Augusta, Missouri, in June 1980. The approval of the Augusta AVA was based largely on its long historical relationship with wine in the United States. The Augusta wine-growing area is a plot of land along the Missouri River, which moderates temperature and provides an appropriate climate for growing grapes.

States or counties can also be used in lieu of an AVA to designate the origin of a wine, provided that 75% of the grapes used in the wine are grown in the state or county listed on the label.

<doc id="245156" wikidata="Q779354" url="?curid=245156" title="Milesians (Irish)">
<text>The Milesians or sons of Míl are the final race to settle in Ireland, according to the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, a medieval Irish Christian history. The Milesians represent the Irish people. They are Gaels who sail to Ireland from Iberia (Hispania) after spending hundreds of years travelling the Earth. When they land in Ireland, they contend with the Tuatha Dé Danann, who represent the Irish pantheon of gods. The two groups agree to divide Ireland between them: the Milesians take the world above, while the Tuath Dé take the world below (i.e. the Otherworld).

Scholars believe that the tale is mostly an invention of medieval Christian writers.

==Myth==
===&quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;===
The 9th century Latin work &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; (History of the Britons) says that Ireland was settled by three groups of people from the Iberian Peninsula. The first are the people of Partholón, who all die of plague. The second are the people of Nemed, who eventually return to Iberia. The last group are led by three sons of a warrior or soldier from Hispania (&quot;mīles Hispaniae&quot;), who sail to Ireland with thirty ships, each carrying thirty wives. They see a glass tower in the middle of the sea with men on top of it, but the men do not answer their calls. They set out to take the tower, but when they reach it, all but one of their ships are sunk by a great wave. Only one ship is saved, and its passengers are the ancestors of all the Irish. In later Irish texts, it is the people of Nemed who are drowned while trying to capture a tower by the sea.

===&quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;===
The &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; (The Book of the Taking of Ireland), an Irish work which was first compiled in the 11th century AD by an anonymous writer, purports to be a history of Ireland and the Irish (the Gaels). It tells us that all mankind is descended from Adam through the sons of Noah, and that a Scythian king named Fénius Farsaid (descendant of Noah&#x27;s son Japheth) is the forebear of the Gaels. Fénius, a prince of Scythia, is described as one of 72 chieftains who built the Tower of Babel. His son Nel weds Scota, daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh, and they have a son named Goídel Glas. Goídel crafts the Goidelic (Gaelic) language from the original 72 languages that arose after the confusion of tongues. Goídel&#x27;s offspring, the Goidels (Gaels), leave Egypt at the same time as the Exodus of the Israelites and settle in Scythia. After some time they leave Scythia and spend 440 years wandering the Earth, undergoing a series of trials and tribulations akin to those of the Israelites, who were said to have spent 40 years wandering in the wilderness. In some versions of the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, there was a succession dispute between Refloir and Míl (also called Galam) over the kingship of Scythia. Míl kills Refloir, and is exiled for this kin-slaying. 

Eventually, Míl and his followers reach Iberia/Hispania by sea and conquer it. There, Goídel&#x27;s descendant Breogán founds a city called Brigantia, and builds a tower from the top of which his son Íth glimpses Ireland. Brigantia refers to Corunna (then known as Brigantium) in modern-day Galicia in Spain, and Breogán&#x27;s tower is likely to have been based on the Tower of Hercules, which was built at Corunna by the Romans.

Íth sails to the island with a group of men. He is welcomed by its three kings: Mac Cuill, Mac Cecht and Mac Gréine. These three are members of the Tuatha Dé Danann, who ruled Ireland at the time. Evidence suggests that Tuath Dé were the main pagan gods of Ireland. Íth is then killed by unnamed attackers and his men return to Iberia. The eight sons of Íth&#x27;s brother Míl (also called Míl Espáine, &#x27;of Hispania&#x27;), lead an invasion force to avenge his death and take Ireland. After they land, they fight against the Tuath Dé and make for Tara, the royal capital. On the way, they are met on three mountains by Banba, Fódla and Ériu – the wives of Ireland&#x27;s three kings. They are believed to have been a trio of land goddesses. Each woman says that the Gaels will have good fortune if they name the land after her. One of the Gaels, Amergin, promises that it shall be so. At Tara, they meet the three kings, who defend their claim to the joint kingship of the land. They ask that there be a three-day truce, during which the Gaels must stay a distance of nine waves from land. The Gaels agree, but once their ships are nine waves from Ireland, the Tuath Dé conjure up a great wind that prevents them sailing back to land. However, Amergin calms the wind by reciting a verse. The surviving ships return to land and the two groups agree to divide Ireland between them. The Gaels take the world above, while the Tuath Dé take the world below (i.e. the Otherworld) and enter the &quot;sídhe&quot;, the ancient burial mounds that dot the Irish landscape. 

Amergin divides the kingship between Éremon, who rules the northern half of Ireland, and Éber Finn, who rules the southern half. This division of the land was probably invented by the writers to explain and justify the 7th/8th-century division between the royal capitals of Tara and Cashel. The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; then traces Ireland&#x27;s dynasties back to Milesian Gaels such as Éremon and Éber. Modern scholars, however, believe that these were fictional characters and that the writers were attempting to give the medieval dynasties more legitimacy.

==Analysis==
Modern scholars believe that the tale is mostly an invention of medieval Irish Christian writers. They sought to link the Irish to people and events from the Old Testament, to liken the Irish to the Israelites, and to reconcile native pagan myth with Christianity. They were inspired by other medieval Christian pseudo-histories, such as Galician cleric Paulus Orosius&#x27;s &quot;History Against the Pagans&quot;, Saint Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot;, and the works of Isidore.

The claim that the Irish Gaels came from the Iberian region of Galicia may be based on three things. The first is the coincidental similarity of the names &quot;Iberia&quot;/&quot;Hiberia&quot; and &quot;Hibernia&quot; and the names &quot;Galicia&quot; and &quot;Gael&quot;. Medieval pseudo-historians made similar claims about other nations based only on their names. The second is Isidore of Seville describing Iberia as the &quot;mother[land] of the races&quot;. Isidore&#x27;s works were a major source of inspiration for the writers of the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;. The third is Orosius describing Ireland as lying &quot;between Iberia and Britain&quot;. The Roman historian Tacitus also thought that Ireland lay between Iberia and Britain. John Carey notes that if Iberia was thought to be the part of mainland Europe nearest to Ireland, it would be natural &quot;to see it as the source of arrivals from overseas&quot;.

The name &quot;Míl Espáine&quot; is a Gaelicization of the Latin &quot;mīles Hispaniae&quot;, &quot;warrior/soldier of Hispania&quot;, first attested in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;. Some antiquarians linked the Irish &#x27;Milesians&#x27; with the ancient Greek Milesians, inhabitants of Miletus. However, Joseph Lennon writes that &quot;no link exists among Míl, Milesians and Miletus in the early origin legends&quot;. He considers it more likely that the name &#x27;Milesian&#x27; came from later English-language translations of the legend, noting &quot;&#x27;Milesian&#x27; is not used to refer to the Irish with any regularity until the eighteenth century&quot;.

The names of some of the Milesians were invented by medieval writers, based on the ethnic names of the Gaels: Goidel Glas (from &quot;Goídel&quot;), Fenius (from &quot;Féni&quot;), Scota (from &quot;Scoti&quot;), Éber (from &quot;Hiberni&quot;), Éremon and Ír (from &quot;Éire&quot;).

==Legacy==
Professor Dáithí Ó hÓgain writes that the &quot;account of how the sons of Míl took Ireland was a literary fabrication, but it was accepted as conventional history by poets and scholars down until the 19th century&quot;. For centuries, the legend was used in Ireland to win and secure dynastic and political legitimacy. For example, in his &quot;Two bokes of the histories of Ireland&quot; (1571), Edmund Campion tried to use the myth to establish an ancient right of the British monarch to rule Ireland. In &quot;A View of the Present State of Ireland&quot;, Edmund Spenser accepted and rejected various parts of the myth both to denigrate the Irish of his day and to justify English colonisation of Ireland in the 1590s (at the height of the Anglo-Spanish war).

The myth was cited during the Contention of the bards, which lasted from 1616 to 1624. During this period poets from the north and south of the island extolled the merits of the dynasties that gave them patronage, and attacked the dynasties from the other half of the island.

Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot; (written c.1634) used the myth to promote the legitimacy of the Stuart claim to royal authority in Ireland (related to the origin of the Lia Fáil), demonstrating that Charles I was descended, through Brian Boru, Éber and Galamh, from Noah and, ultimately, from Adam. 
In the early modern period many Irishmen and women fled to Spain as a result of political and military turmoil in their homeland. The belief that the Gaelic Irish were descended from Míl Espáine and his Spanish followers was current in Spain as well as Ireland, and as a result the Irish in Spain were given all the rights and privileges due to Spanish subjects, such as automatic citizenship granted to Irish Catholics who made it to Spanish territory.

Among the many theories regarding Stone of Scone origins, Medieval Scottish lawyer Baldred Bisset put forward the theory that it was transported from ancient Egypt via the Iberian Peninsula or Celtiberia to Ireland by Scota, the daughter of an Egyptian Pharaoh, who was also the wife of Goídel Glas, an ancestor of the Milesians. The stone has been associated to Lia Fail of the Hill of Tara, which was used as an Irish High Kings&#x27; Inauguration Stone. According to Bisset, Scota along with a band of Irish warriors later invaded Scotland taking her Royal seat with her. Ultimately it was confiscated by Edward I of England through conquest.

<doc id="245159" wikidata="Q13029" url="?curid=245159" title="Castor (star)">
<text>Castor is the second-brightest object in the zodiac constellation of Gemini. It has the Bayer designation α Geminorum, which is Latinised to Alpha Geminorum and abbreviated Alpha Gem or α Gem. With an apparent visual magnitude of 1.58, it is one of the brightest stars in the night sky. Castor appears singular to the naked eye, but it is actually a sextuple star system organized into three binary pairs. Although it is the &#x27;α&#x27; (alpha) member of the constellation, it is half a magnitude fainter than &#x27;β&#x27; (beta) Geminorum, Pollux.

== Stellar system ==




Hierarchy of orbits in the Castor system
Castor is a multiple star system made up of six individual stars; there are three visual components, all of which are spectroscopic binaries. Appearing to the naked eye as a single star, Castor was first recorded as a double star in 1718 by James Pound, but it may have been resolved into at least two sources of light by Cassini as early as 1678. The separation between the binary systems Castor A and Castor B has increased from about 2″ (2 arcseconds of angular measurement) in 1970 to about 6″ in 2017. These pairs have magnitudes of 1.9 and 3.0, respectively.

Castor Aa and Ba both have orbits of a few days with a much fainter companion.

Castor C, or YY Geminorum, was discovered to vary in brightness with a regular period. It is an eclipsing binary with additional variations due to areas of different brightness on the surface of one or both stars, as well as irregular flares. The Castor C components orbit in less than a day. Castor C is believed to be in orbit around Castor AB, but with an extremely long period of several thousand years. It is 73″ distant from the bright components.

The combined apparent magnitude of all six stars is +1.58.

== Physical properties ==
Castor is 49 light-years away from Earth, determined from its large annual parallax.

The two brightest stars are both A-type main-sequence stars, more massive and brighter than the Sun. The properties of their red dwarf companions are difficult to determine, but they are known to have masses 39% that of the Sun.
Castor B is an Am star, with particularly strong spectral lines of certain metals.

Castor C is a variable star, classified as a BY Draconis type. BY Draconis variables are cool dwarf stars which vary as they rotate due to starspots or other variations in their photospheres. The two red dwarfs of Castor C are almost identical, with masses around and luminosities less than 10% of the Sun. Since 2018 it is suspected a brown dwarf with a mass at least times the mass of Jupiter might be orbiting Castor C with a period of 50 years. If it is confirmed, Castor would turn out to be a seven-star system.

All the red dwarfs in the Castor system have emissions lines in their spectra, and all are flare stars.

==Etymology and culture==
&quot;α Geminorum&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Alpha Geminorum&quot;) is the star system&#x27;s Bayer designation.

Castor and Pollux are the two &quot;heavenly twin&quot; stars that give the constellation Gemini (meaning &quot;twins&quot; in Latin) its name. The name &quot;Castor&quot; refers specifically to Castor, one of the twin sons of Zeus and Leda in Greek and Roman mythology.

The star was annotated by the Arabic description &quot;Al Ras al Taum al Muqadim&quot;, which translates as &quot;the head of the foremost twin&quot;. In the catalogue of stars in the &quot;Calendarium of al Achsasi al Mouakket&quot;, this star was designated &quot;Aoul al Dzira&quot;, which was translated into Latin as &quot;Prima Brachii&quot;, meaning &quot;the first in the paw&quot;.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;North River&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Castor, Rho Geminorum, and Pollux. Consequently, Castor itself is known as (, .)

In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Castor&quot; for the star α Geminorum Aa.

Castor C also has the variable-star designation YY Geminorum.

<doc id="245160" wikidata="Q199861" url="?curid=245160" title="Khafre">
<text>Khafre or Chephren (died 2532 BC) was an ancient Egyptian monarch who was the fourth king of the Fourth Dynasty, during the earlier half of the Old Kingdom period (c. 2700–2200 BC). He was son of the king Khufu, and succeeded his brother Djedefre to the throne.

Khafre&#x27;s enormous pyramid at Giza, the Pyramid of Khafre, is surpassed only by his father&#x27;s (the Great Pyramid). The Great Sphinx of Giza was also built for him, according to most Egyptologists. Not much is known about Khafre aside from the reports of Herodotus, a Greek historian who wrote 2,000 years later.

==Family==
Khafre was a son of king Khufu and the brother and successor of Djedefre. Khafre is thought by some to be the son of Queen Meritites I due to an inscription where he is said to honor her memory.
&lt;poem&gt;
Kings-wife, his beloved, devoted to Horus, Mertitytes.
King&#x27;s-wife, his beloved, Mertitytes; beloved of the Favorite of
the Two Goddesses; she who says anything whatsoever and it is done
for her. Great in the favor of Snefr[u]; great in the favor
of Khuf[u], devoted to Horus, honored under Khafre. Merti[tyt]es.&lt;/poem&gt;[Breasted; Ancient Records]

Others argue that the inscription just suggests that this queen died during the reign of Khafre. Khafre may be a son of Queen Henutsen instead.

Khafre had several wives and he had at least 12 sons and 3 or 4 daughters. 
* Queen Meresankh III was the daughter of Kawab and Hetepheres II and thus a niece of Khafre. She was the mother of Khafre&#x27;s sons Nebemakhet, Duaenre, Niuserre and Khentetka, and a daughter named Shepsetkau.
* Queen Khamerernebty I was the mother of Menkaure and his principal queen Khamerernebty II.
* Hekenuhedjet was a wife of Khafre. She is mentioned in the tomb of her son Sekhemkare.
* Persenet may have been a wife of Khafre based on the location of her tomb. She was the mother of Nikaure.

Other children of Khafre are known, but no mothers have been identified. Further sons include Ankhmare, Akhre, Iunmin, and Iunre. Two more daughters named Rekhetre and Hemetre are known as well.

==Reign==

There is no agreement on the date of his reign. Some authors say it was between 2558 BC and 2532 BC. While the Turin King List length for his reign is blank, and Manetho exaggerates his reign as 66 years, most scholars believe it was between 24 and 26 years, based upon the date of the Will of Prince Nekure which was carved on the walls of this Prince&#x27;s mastaba tomb. The will is dated anonymously to the Year of the 12th Count and is assumed to belong to Khafre since Nekure was his son. Khafre&#x27;s highest year date is the &quot;Year of the 13th occurrence&quot; which is a painted date on the back of a casing stone belonging to mastaba G 7650. This would imply a reign of 24–25 years for this king if the cattle count was biannual during the Fourth Dynasty.

==Pyramid complex==

Khafre built the second-largest pyramid at Giza. The Egyptian name of the pyramid was &quot;Wer(en)-Khafre&quot; which means &quot;Khafre is Great&quot;.

The pyramid has a subsidiary pyramid, labeled G2-a. It is not clear who was buried there. Sealings have been found of a King&#x27;s eldest son of his body etc. and the Horus name of Khafre.

===Valley Temple===
The valley temple of Khafre was located closer to the Nile and would have stood right next to the Sphinx temple. Inscriptions from the entrance way have been found which mention Hathor and Bubastis. Blocks have been found showing the partial remains of an inscription with the Horus name of Khafre (Weser-ib). Mariette discovered statues of Khafre in 1860. Several were found in a well in the floor and were headless. But other complete statues were found as well.

===Mortuary Temple===
The mortuary temple was located very close to the pyramid. From the mortuary temple come fragments of maceheads inscribed with Khafre&#x27;s name as well as some stone vessels.

===Great Sphinx and Sphinx temple===
The sphinx is said to date to the time of Khafre. This is supported by the proximity of the sphinx to Khafre&#x27;s pyramid temple complex, and a certain resemblance (despite damage) to the facial structure seen in his statues. The Great Sphinx of Giza may have been carved out as a guardian of Khafre&#x27;s pyramid, and as a symbol of royal power. It became deified during the time of the New Kingdom.

== Khafre in ancient Greek traditions ==
The ancient Egyptian historian Manetho called Khafre &quot;Sûphis II&quot;. and credited him with a rulership of 66 years, but didn&#x27;t make any further comments about him.

Contrary to modern Egyptologists and archaeological findings, Greek historians Diodorus and Herodotus, writing more than 2,000 years after King Khafre, depicted him as a tyrant who had followed his father &quot;Khêops&quot; on the throne. Herodotus and Diodorus say that Khafre ruled for 56 years.

They describe a king Menkaure (whom they call &quot;Mykerînós&quot;) as the follower of Khafre and that this king was the counterpart of his two predecessors: Herodotus describes Menkaure as bringing peace and piety back to Egypt.

Of all the rulers of the Old Kingdom, Khafre is evidenced by the greatest number of statues. Almost all of them come from Giza, partly from the official necropolis there, but mainly from the area around the temple complexes of the Khafre pyramid. In a large hall of the valley temple, 23 depressions have been made in the ground, in which originally life-size statues stood. One of these depressions is wider than the others, there may have been two statues here. It has been suggested that these 24 statues are related to the hours of the day. All of these statues were removed from their location at some point after the reign of Khafre. Auguste Mariette found nine of them during excavations in 1860 (Inv.No. CG 9 to CG 17)[21] and fragments of a tenth (CG 378) [22] in a pit within the valley temple. These statues are now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.

<text>In Mesopotamian mythology, Ereshkigal (Sumerian: 𒀭𒊩𒌆𒆠𒃲 [EREŠ.KI.GAL]), lit. &quot;Queen of the Great Earth&quot;) was the goddess of Kur, the land of the dead or underworld in Sumerian mythology. In later myths, she was said to rule Irkalla alongside her husband Nergal. Sometimes her name is given as Irkalla, similar to the way the name Hades was used in Greek mythology for both the underworld and its ruler, and sometimes it is given as Ninkigal, lit. &quot;Lady of the Great Earth”. 

Ereshkigal was only one of multiple deities regarded as rulers of the underworld in Mesopotamia. The main temple dedicated to her was located in Kutha, a city originally associated with Nergal, and her cult had a very limited scope. No personal names with &quot;Ereshkigal&quot; as a theophoric element are known.

In the ancient Sumerian poem &quot;Inanna&#x27;s Descent to the Underworld&quot;, Ereshkigal is described as Inanna&#x27;s older sister. However, this is a cultural artifact since the Sumerians used terms such as sister as a way to place each other on the same level in hierarchy. 

The two main myths involving Ereshkigal are the story of Inanna&#x27;s descent into the Underworld and the story of Ereshkigal&#x27;s marriage to the god Nergal. Other myths also associate her with gods such as Ninazu, originally regarded as her husband but later as a son, and Ningishzida.

==Mythology==
In Sumerian mythology, Ereshkigal was the queen of the underworld. Some researchers believe that Ninazu originally fulfilled this function, with Ereshkigal only becoming a significant ruler of the land of the dead in Sumerian imagination at a later point in time. However, beliefs related to this sphere were somewhat amorphous, and it is possible there was initially no single universally-agreed-upon version of relevant mythical and cultic concepts, with various deities, both male and female, ruling over the underworld in the belief systems of various areas and time periods.

In later Babylonian god lists, Ereshkigal held a senior status among the underworld deities, ruling over the category of so-called &quot;transtigridian snake gods&quot; (such as Ninazu, Tishpak, Ishtaran, and the Elamite god Inshushinak, in Mesopotamia known almost exclusively in the afterlife context), while Nergal, who fulfilled analogous functions in the north in Sumerian times, had an entourage of minor war gods and disease demons instead. The idea of Nergal and Ereshkigal as a couple likely developed out of a need to reconcile the two traditions.

Ereshkigal&#x27;s &quot;sukkal&quot; (vizier or messenger) was Namtar.

While obscure in cultic texts, Ereshkigal was prominent in mythical literature. Examples of myths where she plays an important role include:

===Inanna&#x27;s Descent into the underworld===
In this poem, the goddess Inanna descends into the underworld, apparently seeking to extend her powers there. Ereshkigal is described as being Inanna&#x27;s older sister. When Neti, the gatekeeper of the underworld, informs Ereshkigal that Inanna is at the gates and demanding to be let in, Ereshkigal responds by ordering Neti to bolt the seven gates of the underworld and to open each separately, but only after Inanna has removed one article of clothing. 

Inanna proceeds through each gate, removing one article of clothing at each gate, and also loses her magic items to a nymph over the course of the journey. Finally, once she has gone through all seven gates, she finds herself naked and powerless, standing before the throne of Ereshkigal. The seven judges of the underworld judge Inanna and declare her to be guilty. Inanna is struck dead and her corpse is hung on a hook in the underworld for everyone to see. 

Inanna&#x27;s minister, Ninshubur, however, pleads with various gods and finally Enki agrees to rescue Inanna from the underworld. Enki sends two sexless beings down to the underworld to revive Inanna with the food and water of life. These beings escort Inanna up from the underworld, but a horde of angry demons follow Inanna, demanding to take someone else down to the underworld as Inanna&#x27;s replacement. They initially want it to be Ninshubur, but Inanna rebukes this order, stating that she would not hand over a loyal subordinate to them. However, when she discovers that her husband, Dumuzid, has not mourned her death, she becomes ireful towards him and orders the demons to take him as her replacement.

Diane Wolkstein argued that Inanna and Ereshkigal represent polar opposites: Inanna is the queen of heaven, but Ereshkigal is the queen of Irkalla.

===Marriage to Nergal===

This myth tells the story of the origin of Ereshkigal&#x27;s marriage to Nergal. Two versions are known, though they differ only in details related to the motivation of the deities involved and both the plot structure and ultimate outcome are the same.

Once, the gods held a banquet that Ereshkigal, as queen of the underworld, could not come up to attend. Kaka, one of the messengers of Anu (analogous to Papsukkal or Ninshubur) invited her to send a messenger, and she sent her vizier Namtar in her place. He was treated well by most, the exception being Nergal, who treated Namtar with disrespect. As a result of this, Ereshkigal demanded Nergal to be sent to the underworld to atone. In one version, she planned to kill Nergal upon arrival in the underworld, but this detail is absent from the other versions.

Nergal travels under the advice of Ea, who warns him not to sit, eat, drink or wash while in the underworld, as well as not to have sex with Ereshkigal. At his advice Nergal travels to the underworld along with 14 demons. When he arrives, the gatekeeper Neti gets orders from Ereshkigal to allow him through the seven gates, stripping him of everything before arriving in the throne room, but at each gate, Nergal posts two demons. 

Although Nergal has no problem with respecting all the other warnings, the god succumbs to the temptation and lies with the goddess for six days. At the seventh, he escapes back to the upper world, which makes Ereshkigal upset. Namtar is then sent to bring Nergal back, but Ea disguises Nergal as a lesser god and Namtar is fooled. Ereshkigal ultimately realizes the deception and demands Nergal to return again, threatening to open the gates of the underworld and allow the spirits of the dead to swarm the world of the living if her demands are ignored. The gods agree to hand Nergal over to her again. 

In the same version in which Ereshkigal planned to kill Nergal, when he gets to the throne he knocks over Namtar and drags Ereshkigal to the floor. He is about to kill her with his ax when she pleads for her life; she promises to be his wife and to share her power with him. He consents. However, Nergal must still leave the underworld for six months, so Ereshkigal gives him back his demons and allows him to traverse the upper world for that time, after which he returns to her.

In the other version, known from two copies, the myth has a less violent ending: according to Assyriologist Alhena Gadotti, &quot;the two deities seem to reunite and live happily ever after,&quot; and the myth concludes with the line &quot;they impetuously entered the bedchamber.&quot;

In both versions, Nergal ends up becoming a king of the underworld, ruling alongside Ereshkigal.

=== Ningishzida&#x27;s journey to the nether world ===

Ereshkigal is mentioned near the end of this composition. The vegetation god Ningishzida presumably has to descend to her kingdom each year.

=== The underworld vision of an Assyrian prince ===

Ereshkigal is listed alongside other underworld deities. Nergal is described as her husband in this text.

==Family==
In some versions of the myths, Ereshkigal rules the Underworld by herself, but in other versions of the myths, she rules alongside a husband subordinate to her named Gugalana. Gugalana had no fixed identity. In Inanna&#x27;s descent he dies before the events of the myth; in some inscriptions he is the father of Ninazu; eventually this name became a title of Nergal as well.

In Sumerian mythology, Ereshkigal is the mother of the goddess Nungal. In a fragmentary text translated by Jeremiah Peterson, Nungal appears alongside Ereshkigal and the healing goddess Nintinugga.

In one late magical text her son with Enlil was her vizier Namtar.

==Syncretism==
The Hurrian underworld goddess Allani was conflated with Ereshkigal in Mesopotamia, and with the Sun goddess of the Earth among the Hittites and Luwians. While Allani was originally introduced in Mesopotamia as an independent figure, receiving offerings in Ur during Shulgi&#x27;s reign under the name Allatum (alongside other foreign deities such as Ishara and Belet Nagar), she gradually became little more than a title of Ereshkigal. 

The Hattian death god Lelwani, originally described as a male deity with the masculine title of &quot;katte&quot; (king), started to be viewed as a goddess instead due to conflation with Allani and Ereshkigal.

=== Ereshkigal&#x27;s name in Greek magical texts ===
In later times, the Greeks appear to have applied the name Ereshkigal (Ερεσχιγαλ) to their own goddess Hecate. In the heading of a spell in the Michigan Magical Papyrus, which has been dated to the late third or early fourth century A.D. (and as such was written after the art of reading cuneiform texts was lost), Hecate is referred to as &quot;Hecate Ereschkigal&quot; and is invoked using magical words and gestures to alleviate the caster&#x27;s fear of punishment in the afterlife. Further study of Greek texts which mention the name of Ereshkigal revealed that none feature motifs of Mesopotamian origin in any meaningful capacity, the symbols used are ones associated with Hecate rather than Ereshkigal, the use of Ereshkigal&#x27;s name served no purpose other than &quot;furnishing the Greek Netherworld goddess with a mysterious-sounding, foreign name,&quot; and that the people who &quot;composed, transmitted and used these texts had either little interest in or little knowledge of (or both) the Mesopotamian traditions associated with Ereškigal.&quot;

== Obsolete theories ==

In his 1944 book, &quot;Sumerian Mythology: A Study of Spiritual and Literary Achievement in the Third Millennium B.C.&quot; Samuel Noah Kramer proposed that, according to the introductory passage of the ancient Sumerian epic poem, &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld,&quot; Ereshkigal was forcibly abducted, taken down to the Underworld by the Kur, and was forced to become queen of the Underworld against her will. In order to avenge the abduction of Ereshkigal, Enki, the god of water, set out in a boat to slay the Kur. The Kur defends itself by pelting Enki with rocks of many sizes and by sending the waves beneath Enki&#x27;s boat to attack Enki. The poem never actually explains who the ultimate victor of the battle is, but it is implied that Enki wins. Samuel Noah Kramer relates this myth to the ancient Greek myth of the abduction of Persephone, asserting that the Greek story is probably derived from the ancient Sumerian story.

This view, and even the idea of Kur being a single well-defined monster rather than a vague term referring to mountains, foreign lands or the underworld, are not supported by modern scholars. The passage mentioned is interpreted as Enlil and Anu assigning a dowry to Ereshkigal.

<text>A military order () is a Christian religious society of knights. The original military orders were the Knights Templar, the Knights Hospitaller, the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, the Order of Saint James, the Order of Calatrava, and the Teutonic Knights. They arose in the Middle Ages in association with the Crusades, in the Holy Land, the Baltics, and the Iberian peninsula; their members being dedicated to the protection of pilgrims and Christians, as well as the defence of the Crusader states. They are the predecessors of chivalric orders.

Most members of military orders were laymen who took religious vows, such as of poverty, chastity, and obedience, according to monastic ideals. The orders owned houses called commanderies all across Europe and had a hierarchical structure of leadership with the grand master at the top.

The Knights Templar, the largest and most influential of the military orders, was suppressed in the early fourteenth century; only a handful of orders were established and recognized afterwards. However, some persisted longer in their original functions, such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the Order of Saint John, the respective Catholic and Protestant successors of the Knights Hospitaller, alongside the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, which remains active under the Pope&#x27;s sovereignty. Those military orders that survive today have evolved into purely honorific or ceremonial orders or else into charitable foundations.

==History==

In 1053, for the Battle of Civitate, the Knights of Saint Peter () was founded as a militia by Pope Leo IX to counter the Normans.

In response to the Islamic conquests of the former Byzantine Empire, numerous Catholic military orders were set up following the First Crusade. The founding of such orders suited the Catholic church&#x27;s plan of channeling the devotion of the European nobility toward achieving the Church&#x27;s temporal goals, and it also complemented the Peace and Truce of God. The foundation of the Knights Templar in 1118 provided the first in a series of tightly organized military forces for the purpose of opposing Islamic conquests in the Holy Land and in the Iberian Peninsula — see the Reconquista — as well as Islamic invaders and pagan tribes in Eastern Europe which were perceived as threats to the Church&#x27;s supremacy.

The first secularized military order was the Order of Saint George, founded in 1326 by King Charles I of Hungary, through which he made all the Hungarian nobility swear loyalty to him. Shortly thereafter, the Order of the &quot;Knights of the Band&quot; was founded in 1332 by King Alfonso XI of Castile. Both orders existed only for about a century.

==Purpose==
The original features of the military orders were the combination of religious and military ways of life. Some of them, like the Knights Hospitaller, the Knights of Saint Thomas, and the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus also had charitable purposes and cared for the sick and poor. However, they were not purely male institutions, as nuns could attach themselves as convents of the orders. One significant feature of the military orders was that clerical brothers could be subordinate to non-ordained brethren.

In 1818, orientalist Joseph von Hammer compared the Catholic military orders, in particular the Knights Templar, to certain Islamic models such as the Muslim sect of Assassins. In 1820, José Antonio Conde suggested they were modeled on the ribat, a fortified religious institution which brought together a religious or hospital way of life with fighting the enemies of Islam. However popular such views may have become, others have criticized this view, suggesting there were no such ribats around Outremer until after the military orders had been founded.

The role and function of the military orders extended beyond their military exploits in the Holy Land, Prussia, and the Baltics. In fact, they had extensive holdings and staff throughout Western Europe. The majority were laymen. They provided a conduit for cultural and technical innovation, such as the introduction of fulling into England by the Knights Hospitaller, and the banking facilities of the Knights Templar.

===Northern crusades===
In 1147 Bernard of Clairvaux persuaded Pope Eugenius III that the Germans&#x27; and Danes&#x27; conflict with the pagan Wends was a holy war analogous to the Reconquista; he urged a crusade until all heathens were baptised or killed. The new crusaders&#x27; motivation was primarily economic: the acquisition of new arable lands and serfs; the control of Baltic trade routes; and the abolishment of the Novgorodian merchants&#x27; monopoly of the fur trade. From the early 13thcentury the military orders provided garrisons in Old Livonia and defended the German commercial centre, Riga. The Livonian Brothers of the Sword and the Order of Dobrzyń were established by local bishops. The Sword Brothers were notorious for cruelty to &quot;pagans&quot; and converts alike. The Teutonic Knights were founded during the 1190s in Palestine, but their strong links to Germany diverted efforts from the Holy Land to the Baltic. Between 1229 and 1290, the Teutonic Knights absorbed both the Brothers of the Sword and the Order of Dobrzyń, subjugated most of the Baltic tribes and established a ruthless and exploitative monastic state. The Knights invited foreign nobility to join their regular &quot;Reisen&quot;, or raids, against the last unconquered Baltic people, the Lithuanians. These were fashionable events of chivalric entertainment among young aristocrats. Jogaila, Grand Duke of Lithuania, converted to Catholicism and married Queen Jadwiga of Poland resulting in a united Polish–Lithuanian army routing the Knights at Tannenberg in 1410. The Knights&#x27; state survived, from 1466 under Polish suzerainty. Prussia was transformed into a secular duchy in 1525, and Livonia in 1562.

==List of military orders==
These are military orders listed chronologically according to their dates of foundation and extinction, sometimes approximate due to scarce sources, and/or repeated suppressions by Papal or royal authorities. Presently active institutions are listed in consideration with their legitimacy according to the International Commission on Orders of Chivalry.

They are divided into international and national according to their adherence, mission, and enrollment, disregarding the extent of eventual gradual geographical distribution outside of their region of concern.

===National===
===Other===
Chivalric and/or military orders that could qualify depending on definition.
* Confraternity of Belchite, &quot;experimental&quot; confraternity of knights founded in 1122 by King Alfonso the Battler of Aragon
* Order of Saint Blaise, founded in the 12th century in Armenia to defend the country against the attacks of the Muslims
* Knights of the Band, early honorific military order founded c. 1330 by King Alfonso XI of Castile
* Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation, military order founded in 1350 by Duke Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy, the first called the &quot;Order of the True Lover&#x27;s Knots&quot; in memory of a bracelet of hair presented to the founder by a lady, but upon the election of Amadeus VIII to the pontificate in 1439, it changed its name for that of the &quot;Annunciation of angel Gabriel&quot;
* Order of the Dove, short-lived (one year) and controversial order founded in 1379 by King Juan I of Castile
* Order of Saint Anthony (Bavaria), Bavarian military order founded in 1382 by Duke Albert I, Duke of Bavaria

* , founded in 1261 by King Ferdinand III of Castile
*Order of the Hatchet female spanish military order during the middle ages.

==Modern development==
A few of the institutions survived into honorific and/or charitable organizations, including the papal orders of knighthood.

While other contemporary Catholic societies may share some military organizational features and ideology, such as the Society of Jesus, they differ from the medieval military orders in the absence of military purposes or potential.

Modern orders may still be founded explicitly as a military order; the Military Order of Loyalty () was founded in 1946 by the Spanish protectorate in Morocco. Awarded to both Spanish and Moroccan military officers and soldiers, the single-class order was abolished in 1956.

<doc id="245170" wikidata="Q1265605" url="?curid=245170" title="Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham">
<text>Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, 6th Earl of Stafford, 7th Baron Stafford (15 August 1402 – 10 July 1460) of Stafford Castle in Staffordshire, was an English nobleman and a military commander in the Hundred Years&#x27; War and the Wars of the Roses. Through his mother he had royal descent from King Edward III, his great-grandfather, and from his father, he inherited, at an early age, the earldom of Stafford. By his marriage to a daughter of Ralph, Earl of Westmorland, Humphrey was related to the powerful Neville family and to many of the leading aristocratic houses of the time. He joined the English campaign in France with King Henry V in 1420 and following Henry V&#x27;s death two years later he became a councillor for the new king, the nine-month-old Henry VI. Stafford acted as a peacemaker during the partisan, factional politics of the 1430s, when Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, vied with Cardinal Beaufort for political supremacy. Stafford also took part in the eventual arrest of Gloucester in 1447.

Stafford returned to the French campaign during the 1430s and for his loyalty and years of service, he was elevated from Earl of Stafford to Duke of Buckingham. Around the same time, his mother died. As much of his estate—as her dower—had previously been in her hands, Humphrey went from having a reduced income in his early years to being one of the wealthiest and most powerful landowners in England. His lands stretched across much of the country, ranging from East Anglia to the Welsh border. Being such an important figure in the localities was not without its dangers and for some time he feuded violently with Sir Thomas Malory in the Midlands.

After returning from France, Stafford remained in England for the rest of his life, serving King Henry. He acted as the King&#x27;s bodyguard and chief negotiator during Jack Cade&#x27;s Rebellion of 1450, helping to suppress it. When the King&#x27;s cousin, Richard, Duke of York, rebelled two years later, Stafford investigated York&#x27;s followers. In 1453, the King became ill and sank into a catatonic state; law and order broke down further and when civil war began in 1455, Stafford fought for the King in the First Battle of St Albans which began the Wars of the Roses. Both were captured by the Yorkists and Stafford spent most of his final years attempting to mediate between the Yorkist and Lancastrian factions, the latter by now headed by Henry&#x27;s wife, Margaret of Anjou. Partly due to a feud with a leading Yorkist—Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick—Stafford eventually declared for King Henry and the Duke of York was defeated in 1459, driving York into exile. When the rebels returned the following year they attacked the royal army at Northampton. Acting as the King&#x27;s personal guard in the ensuing struggle, Stafford was killed and the King was again taken prisoner. Stafford&#x27;s eldest son had died of plague two years earlier and the Buckingham dukedom descended to Stafford&#x27;s five-year-old grandson, Henry, a ward of the King until he came of age in 1473.

== Background and youth ==

Humphrey Stafford was born in Stafford sometime on August 15, 1402. He was the only son of Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford, and Anne of Gloucester, who was the daughter of Edward III&#x27;s youngest son Thomas of Woodstock. This gave Humphrey royal descent, and made him a second cousin to the then king, Henry IV.

On 21 July 1403, when Humphrey was less than a year old, his father was killed fighting for Henry IV against the rebel Henry Hotspur at the Battle of Shrewsbury. Humphrey became 6th Earl of Stafford. With the earldom came a large estate with land in more than a dozen counties. Through her previous marriage to Edmund&#x27;s older brother, Thomas, his mother accumulated two dowries, each comprising a third of the Stafford estates. She occupied these lands for the next twenty years, and Humphrey received a reduced income of less than £1,260 a year until he came of age. As his mother could not, by law, be his guardian, Humphrey became a royal ward and was put under the guardianship of Henry IV&#x27;s queen, Joan of Navarre. His minority lasted for the next twenty years.

== Early career ==
Although Stafford received a reduced inheritance, as the historian Carol Rawcliffe has put it, &quot;fortunes were still to be made in the French wars&quot;. Stafford assumed the profession of arms. He fought with Henry V during the 1420 campaign in France and was knighted on 22 April the following year. On 31 August 1422, while campaigning, Henry V contracted dysentery and died. Stafford was present at his death and joined the entourage that returned to England with the royal corpse. When Stafford was later asked by the royal council if the King had left any final instructions regarding the governance of Normandy, he claimed that he had been too upset at the time to be able to remember. Stafford was still a minor, but parliament soon granted him livery of his father&#x27;s estate, allowing him full possession. The grant was based on Stafford&#x27;s claim that the King had orally promised him this before dying. The grant did not require him to pay a fee into the Exchequer, as was normal.

The new king, Henry VI, was still only a baby, so the lords decided that the dead King&#x27;s brothers—John, Duke of Bedford and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester—would have to be prominent in this minority government. Bedford, it was decided, would rule as regent in France, while Gloucester would be chief councillor (although not protector) in England. Stafford became a member of the new royal council on its formation. It first met in November 1422 and Stafford was to be an assiduous attender for the next three years. Gloucester repeatedly claimed the title of Protector based on his relationship to the dead King. By 1424, the rivalry between him and his uncle Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester—as &quot;de facto&quot; head of council—had become an outright conflict. Although Stafford seems to have personally favoured the interests of Gloucester in the latter&#x27;s struggle for supremacy over Beaufort, Stafford attempted to be a moderating influence. For example, in October 1425, Archbishop of Canterbury Henry Chichele, Peter, Duke of Coimbra and Stafford helped to negotiate an end to a burst of violence that had erupted in London between followers of the two rivals. In 1428, when Gloucester again demanded an increase in his power, Stafford was one of the councillors who personally signed a strong statement to the effect that Gloucester&#x27;s position had been formulated six years earlier, would not change now, and that in any case, the King would attain his majority within a few years. Stafford was also chosen by the council to inform Beaufort—now a Cardinal—that he was to absent himself from Windsor until it was decided if he could carry out his traditional duty of Prelate to the Order of the Garter now that Pope Martin V had promoted him.
Stafford was made a Knight of the Order of the Garter in April 1429. The following year, he travelled to France with the King for Henry&#x27;s French coronation, escorting him through the war-torn countryside. The Earl was appointed Lieutenant-General of Normandy, Governor of Paris, and Constable of France over the course of his next two years of service there. Apart from one occasion in November 1430 when he and Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter took the English army to support Philip, Duke of Burgundy, Stafford&#x27;s primary military role at this time was defending Paris and its environs. He also attended the interrogation of Joan of Arc in Rouen in 1431; at some point during these proceedings, a contemporary alleged, Stafford attempted to stab her and had to be physically restrained.

On 11 October 1431 the King created Stafford Count of Perche, which was a province in English-occupied Normandy; he was to hold the title until the English finally withdrew from Normandy in 1450. The county was valued at 800 marks per annum, although the historian Michael Jones has suggested that due to the war, in real terms &quot;the amount of revenue that could be extracted ... must have been considerably lower&quot;. Since Perche was a frontier region, in a state of almost constant conflict, whatever income the estate generated was immediately re-invested in its defence.

In England, the King&#x27;s minority ended in 1436. In preparation for his personal rule, the council reorganised Henry&#x27;s Lancastrian estates to be under the control of local magnates. This gave Stafford responsibility for much of the north Midlands, which was the largest single area of the duchy to be delegated among the nobility. This put the royal affinity—those men retained directly by the Crown to provide a direct link between the King and the localities—at his command.

=== Estates ===
The centrepiece of Stafford&#x27;s estates, and his own caput, was Stafford Castle. Here he maintained a permanent staff of at least forty people, as well as a large stable, and it was especially well-placed for recruiting retainers in the Welsh Marches, Staffordshire, and Cheshire. He also had manor houses at Writtle and Maxstoke, which he had purchased as part of most of the estates of John, Lord Clinton. Writtle was particularly favoured by the Earl, and they were both useful when the royal court was in Coventry. Likewise, he made his base at Tonbridge Castle when he was acting as Warden of the Cinque Ports or on commission in Kent. His Marcher castles—Caus, Hay, Huntingdon, and Bronllys—had, by the 1450s, generally fallen into disrepair, and his other border castles, such as Brecon and Newport, he rarely used. Stafford&#x27;s Thornbury manor was convenient for Bristol and was a stopping point to and from London.

Stafford&#x27;s mother&#x27;s death in 1438 transformed his fiscal position. He now received the remainder of his father&#x27;s estates—worth about £1,500—and his mother&#x27;s half of the de Bohun inheritance, which was worth another £1,200. The latter also included the earldom of Buckingham, worth £1,000 on its own; Stafford had become one of the greatest landowners in England overnight. &quot;His landed resources matched his titles&quot;, explained Albert Compton-Reves, scattered as they were throughout England, Wales and Ireland, with only the King and Richard, Duke of York wealthier. One assessment of his estates suggests that, by the late 1440s, his income was over £5,000 per annum, and K. B. McFarlane estimated Stafford&#x27;s total potential income from land to have been £6,300 gross annually, at its peak between 1447 and 1448. On the other hand, the actual yield may have been lower; around £3,700: rents, for example, were often difficult to collect. Even a lord of the status of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, owed Stafford over £100 in unpaid rent for the manor of Drayton Bassett in 1458. In the 1440s and 1450s, Stafford&#x27;s Welsh estates were particularly notable for both their rent arrears and public disorder. Further—and like most nobles of the period—he substantially overspent, possibly, says Harriss, by as much as £300 a year. His treasurer, William Wistowe, when rendering his accounts for the years 1452–1453, noted that Stafford was owed £730 by his reckoning, some debts being 20 years old. Despite this, says Woolgar, &quot;there [is] no suggestion that [Stafford] found it difficult to obtain cash or goods&quot;.

=== Affinity and problems in the localities ===
In the late medieval period, all great lords created an affinity between themselves and groups of supporters, who often lived and travelled with them for purposes of mutual benefit and defence, and Humphrey Stafford was no exception. These men were generally his estate tenants, who could be called upon when necessary for soldiering, as well as other duties, and were often retained by indenture. In the late 1440s his immediate affinity was at least ten knights and twenty-seven esquires, mainly drawn from Cheshire. By the 1450s—a period beginning with political tension and ending with civil war—Stafford retained men specifically &quot;to sojourn and ride&quot; with him. His affinity was probably composed along the lines laid out by royal ordinance at the time which dictated the nobility should be accompanied by no more than 240 men, including &quot;forty gentlemen, eighty yeomen and a variety of lesser individuals&quot;, suggested T. B. Pugh, although in peacetime Stafford would have required far fewer. It was directly due to the political climate that this increased, especially after 1457. Stafford&#x27;s household more generally has been estimated at 150 people by about 1450, and it has been estimated that maintaining both his affinity and household cost him over £900 a year.
Along with Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, Stafford was the major magnatial influence in Warwickshire, so when Beauchamp left for a lengthy tour of duty in France, in 1437, Stafford became the centre of regional power stretching from Warwickshire to Derbyshire. He was sufficiently involved in the royal court and government that he was often unable to attend to the needs of his region. This caused him local difficulties; on 5May 1430 a Leicestershire manor of Stafford&#x27;s was attacked and he faced problems in Derbyshire in the 1440s, although there, Helen Castor has said, Stafford &quot;made no attempt to restore peace, nor made any attempt to intervene at all&quot;. Stafford also had major estates on the Welsh Marches. This area was prone to regular lawlessness and particularly occupied his time as a royal justice.

One of the best-known disputes Stafford had with his local gentry was in his Midlands heartlands. This was with Sir Thomas Malory. On 4 January 1450, Malory, with twenty-six other armed men, waited for Stafford near Coombe Abbey woods—near the Stafford&#x27;s Newbold estate—intending to ambush him. Stafford fought back, repelling Malory&#x27;s small force with sixty yeomenry. In another episode, Malory stole deer from the earl&#x27;s park at Caludon. Stafford personally arrested Malory on 25 July 1451. The Earl also ended up in a dispute with William Ferrers of Staffordshire, even though the region was the centre of Stafford&#x27;s authority and where he may have expected to be strongest. Ferrers had recently been appointed to the county King&#x27;s Bench and attempted to assert political control over the county as a result. Following Cade&#x27;s rebellion in 1450, Stafford&#x27;s park at Penshurst was attacked by local men whom the historian Ralph Griffiths describes as &quot;concealing their faces with long beards and charcoal-blackened faces, calling themselves servants of the queen of the fairies&quot;. Towards the end of the decade, not only was he unable to prevent feuding amongst the local gentry, but his own affinity was in discord. This may in part be due to the fact that at this time he was not spending much of his time in the Midlands, preferring to stay close to London and the King, dwelling either at his manors of Tonbridge or Writtle.

== Later career ==
In July 1436, Stafford, accompanied by Gloucester, John de Mowbray, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, John Holland Earl of Huntingdon, the Earl of Warwick, Thomas de Courtenay, 5th/13th Earl of Devon, and James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond, returned to France again with an army of nearly 8,000 men. Although the expedition&#x27;s purpose was to end the siege of Calais by Philip, Duke of Burgundy, the Burgundians had withdrawn before they arrived, leaving behind a quantity of cannon for the English to seize. Subsequent peace talks in France occupied Stafford throughout 1439, and in 1442 he was appointed Captain of Calais and the Risbanke fort, and was indented to serve for the next decade. Before his departure for Calais in September 1442, the garrison had revolted and seized the Staple&#x27;s wool in lieu of unpaid wages. Stafford received a pledge from the council that if such a situation arose again during his tenure, he would not be held responsible. In light of the secrecy that cloaked Stafford&#x27;s appointment in 1442, suggests David Grummitt, it is possible that the revolt had actually been staged by his servants to ensure that Stafford &quot;had entry [to Calais] on favourable terms&quot;. Stafford himself emphasised the need to restore order there in his original application for the office. He also received another important allowance, being granted permission to export gold and jewels (up to the value of £5,000 per trip) for his use in France, even though the export of bullion was illegal at the time. He served the full term of his appointment as Calais captain, leaving office in 1451.

Around 1435, Stafford was granted the Honour of Tutbury, which he held until 1443. Then, says Griffiths, Buckingham proceeded to transfer it to one of his councillor&#x27;s sons. Other offices he held around this time included Seneschal of Halton from 1439, and Lieutenant of the Marches from 1442 to 1451. Stafford became less active on the council around the same time. He became Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Constable of Dover Castle and Constable of Queenborough, on the Isle of Sheppey, in 1450. He again represented the Crown during further peace talks with the French in 1445 and 1446.

In the event, Stafford rarely visited Calais. Factional strife had continued intermittently between Beaufort and Gloucester, and Stafford—who had also been appointed Constable of England—was by now firmly in the Beaufort camp. In 1442, he had been on the committee that investigated and convicted Gloucester&#x27;s wife, Eleanor Cobham, of witchcraft, and five years later he arrested the Duke at Bury St Edmunds on 18 February 1447 for treason. Like many others, Stafford profited substantially from Gloucester&#x27;s fall: when the latter&#x27;s estates were divided up, the &quot;major prizes&quot; went to the court nobility.

In September 1444, as reward for his loyal and continuous service to the Crown, he was created Duke of Buckingham. By then he was already describing himself as &quot;the Right Mighty Prince Humphrey Earl of Buckingham, Hereford, Stafford, Northampton and Perche, Lord of Brecknock and Holdernesse&quot;. Three years later he was granted precedence over all English dukes not of royal blood. Despite his income and titles he was consistently heavily out of pocket. Although rarely in Calais, he was responsible for ensuring the garrison was paid, and it has been estimated that when he resigned and returned from the post in 1450, he was owed over £19,000 in back wages. This was such a large amount that he was granted the wool trade tax from the port of Sandwich, Kent, until it was paid off. His other public offices also forced him to spend over his annual income, and he had household costs of over £2,000. He was also a substantial creditor to the government, which was perennially short of cash.

With the outbreak of Jack Cade&#x27;s rebellion, Buckingham summoned about seventy of his tenants from Staffordshire to accompany him while he was in London in May 1450. He was one of the lords commissioned to arrest the rebels as part of a forceful government response on 6 June 1450, and he acted as a negotiator with the insurgents at Blackheath ten days later. The promises that Buckingham made on behalf of the government were not kept, and Cade&#x27;s army invaded London. After the eventual defeat of the rebellion, Buckingham headed an investigatory commission designed to pacify rebellious Kent, and in November that year he rode noisily through London—with a retinue of around 1,500 armed men—with the King and other peers, in a demonstration of royal authority intended to deter potential troublemakers in the future. Following the rebellion, Buckingham and his retinue often acted as a bodyguard to the King.

== Wars of the Roses ==

In 1451, the King&#x27;s favourite, Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, replaced William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk as the King&#x27;s chief councillor, and Buckingham supported Somerset&#x27;s government. At the same time, he tried to maintain peace between Somerset and York, who by now was Somerset&#x27;s bitter enemy. When York rebelled in 1452 and confronted the King with a large army at Dartford, Buckingham was again a voice of compromise and, since he had contributed heavily towards the size of the King&#x27;s army, his voice was heeded. Buckingham took part in a peace commission on 14 February that month in Devon, which prevented Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon from joining York at Dartford. A year later, in August 1453, King Henry became ill, and slipped into a catatonic state; government slowly broke down. At Christmas, Buckingham personally presented the King&#x27;s son—the newly born Edward, Prince of Wales—to the King. But Henry remained unable to respond. Buckingham took part in the council meeting which resulted in the arrest and subsequent year-long imprisonment of the Duke of Somerset. In the February 1454 parliament Buckingham was appointed Steward of England, although Griffiths called this position &quot;largely honorific&quot;. This parliament also appointed York as Protector of the Realm from 27 March 1454. Buckingham supported York&#x27;s protectorate, attending York&#x27;s councils more frequently than most of his fellow councillors. The King recovered his health in January 1455, and, soon after, Somerset was released—or may have escaped—from the Tower. A contemporary commented how Buckingham &quot;straungely conveied&quot; Somerset from prison, but it is uncertain whether this was as a result of the King ordering his release or whether Somerset escaped with Buckingham&#x27;s connivance. Buckingham may well by now have been expecting war to break out, because the same year he ordered the purchase of 2,000 cognizances—his personal badge of the &#x27;Stafford knot&#x27;—even though strictly the distribution of livery was illegal.

=== Battle of St Albans ===

Following the King&#x27;s recovery, York was either dismissed from or resigned his protectorship, and together with his Neville allies, withdrew from London to their northern estates. Somerset—in charge of government once again—summoned a Great Council to meet in Leicester on 22 May 1455. The Yorkists believed they would be arrested or attainted at this meeting. As a result, they gathered a small force and marched south. The King, with a smaller force that nonetheless included important nobles such as Somerset, Northumberland, Clifford and Buckingham and his son Humphrey, Earl of Stafford, was likewise marching from Westminster to Leicester, and in the early morning of 22 May, royal scouts reported the Yorkists as being only a few hours away. Buckingham urged that they push on to St Albans—so that the King might dine—which was not particularly easy to defend. Buckingham also assumed that York would want to parley before launching an assault on the King, as he had in 1452. The decision to head for the town and not make a stand straight away may have been a tactical error; the contemporary &quot;Short English Chronicle&quot; describes how the Lancastrians &quot;strongly barred and arrayed for defence&quot; immediately after they arrived.
The King was lodged in the town and York, with Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury and the Earl of Warwick, encamped to the south. Negotiations commenced immediately. York demanded that Somerset be released into his custody, and the King replaced Somerset as Lord High Constable with Buckingham, making Somerset subordinate. In that capacity, Buckingham became the King&#x27;s personal negotiator—Armstrong suggests because he was well known to be able to &quot;concede but not capitulate&quot;—and received and responded to the Yorkists&#x27; messengers. His strategy was to play for time, both to prepare the town&#x27;s defences and to await the arrival of loyalist bishops, who could be counted on to bring the moral authority of the church to bear on the Yorkists. Buckingham received at least three Yorkist embassies, but the King—or Buckingham—refused to give in to the main Yorkist demand, that Somerset be surrendered to them. Buckingham may have hoped that repeated negotiations would deplete the Yorkists&#x27; zest for battle, and delay long enough for reinforcements to arrive. Buckingham made what John Gillingham described as an &quot;insidiously tempting suggestion&quot; that the Yorkists mull over the King&#x27;s responses in Hatfield or Barnet overnight. Buckingham&#x27;s confidence in how reasonable the Yorkists would be was misplaced.

The Yorkists realised what Buckingham—&quot;prevaricating with courtesy&quot;, says Armstrong—was trying to do and battle commenced while negotiations were still taking place: Richard, Earl of Warwick, launched a surprise attack at around ten o&#x27;clock in the morning. Buckingham commanded the King&#x27;s army of 2,500 men, although his coordination of the town&#x27;s defence was problematic, giving the initiative to the Yorkists. Although the defences that Buckingham had organised successfully checked the Yorkists&#x27; initial advance, Warwick took his force through gardens and houses to attack the Lancastrians in the rear. The battle was soon over, and had lasted between half an hour and an hour with only about 50 casualties. They included senior Lancastrian captains: Somerset, Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland and Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford had all been killed. Buckingham himself was wounded three times in the face by arrows—and sought sanctuary in the abbey. His son appears to have been badly wounded. A chronicler reported that some Yorkist soldiers, intent on looting, entered the abbey to kill Buckingham, but that the Duke was saved by York&#x27;s personal intervention. In any case, says Harriss, Buckingham was probably captured with the King, although he was still able to reward ninety of his retainers from Kent, Sussex and Surrey. It is not known for certain whether these men had actually fought with him at St Albans; as K. B. McFarlane points out, many retinues did not arrive in time to fight.

== Last years ==
York now had the political upper hand, made himself Constable of England and kept the King as a prisoner, returning to the role of Protector when Henry became ill again. Buckingham swore to &quot;draw the lyne&quot; with York, and supported his second protectorate, although losing Queen Margaret&#x27;s favour as a result. A contemporary wrote that in April 1456 the Duke returned to his Writtle manor, not looking &quot;well plesid&quot;. Buckingham played an important role at the October 1456 Great Council in Leicester. Here, with other lords, he tried to persuade the King to impose a settlement, and at the same time declared that anyone who resorted to violence would receive &quot;ther deserte&quot;—which included any who attacked York.

In 1459, with other lords, he renewed his oath of loyalty to the King and Prince of Wales. Until this point he had been a voice of restraint within the King&#x27;s faction. But he had been restored to the Queen&#x27;s favour that year and—as she was the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the party—his realignment was decisive enough that it ultimately hastened the outbreak of hostilities again. Buckingham may also have been partially motivated by financial needs, and encouraged to do so by those retainers reliant on him. He had a bigger retinue than almost any other noble in England and was still the only one who could match York in power and income. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Ludford Bridge in October 1459, where his army played a decisive part in the defeat of the Yorkist forces. Following their defeat, York and the Neville earls fled Ludlow and went into exile; York to Ireland, the earls to Calais. They were attainted at the Coventry parliament later that year, and their estates distributed amongst the Crown&#x27;s supporters. Buckingham was rewarded by the King with extensive grants from the estates of Sir William Oldhall, worth about £800 per annum. With York in exile, Buckingham was granted custody of York&#x27;s wife, Cecily, Duchess of York, whom, a chronicler reports, he treated harshly in her captivity.

=== Death at Northampton ===
From the moment the Duke of York and the Neville earls left England it was obvious to the government that they would return; the only question was when. After a series of false alarms in early 1460, they eventually did so in June, landing at Sandwich, Kent. They immediately marched on, and entered London; the King, with Buckingham and other lords, was in Coventry, and on hearing of the earls&#x27; arrival, moved the court to Northampton. The Yorkists left London and marched to the King; they were accompanied by the Papal legate Francesco Coppini. In the lead up to the Battle of Northampton, the Earl of Warwick and Edward, Earl of March sent envoys to negotiate, but Buckingham—once again the King&#x27;s chief negotiator, and backed by his son-in-law, John Talbot and Lords Beaumont and Egremont—was no longer conciliatory. Buckingham denied the Yorkists&#x27; envoys&#x27; repeated requests for an audience with Henry, denouncing the earls: &quot;the Earl of Warwick shall not come to the King&#x27;s presence and if he comes he shall die&quot;. Buckingham condemned the bishops who had accompanied the Yorkist army as well, telling them that they were not men of peace, but men of war, and there could now be no peace with Warwick. Personal animosity as much as political judgment was responsible for Buckingham&#x27;s attitude, possibly, suggests Rawcliffe, the result of Warwick&#x27;s earlier rent evasion. Buckingham&#x27;s influential voice was chief among those demanding a military response to Warwick and March; the Duke may also have misinterpreted the Yorkists&#x27; requests to negotiate as a sign of weakness, seeing the coming battle as an opportunity to settle scores with Warwick. But Buckingham misjudged both the size of the Yorkist army—which outnumbered that of the King—and the loyalty of the Lancastrian army. Whatever plans Buckingham had, says Carol Rawcliffe, they &quot;ended abruptly&quot; on the battlefield.

Buckingham&#x27;s men dug in outside Northampton&#x27;s southern walls, and fortified behind a tributary of the River Nene, close to Delapré Abbey. Battle was joined early on 10 July 1460. Although it was expected to be a drawn-out affair—due to the near-impregnability of the royal position—it was shortened considerably when Lord Edmund Grey of Ruthin turned traitor to the King. Grey &quot;welcomed the Yorkists over the barricades&quot; on the Lancastrian wing and ordered his men to lay down arms, allowing the Yorkists access to the King&#x27;s camp. Within half an hour, the battle was over. By 2:00pm, Buckingham, John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury, Lord Egremont and Viscount Beaumont, had all been killed by a force of Kentishmen. The Duke was buried shortly after at Grey Friars Abbey in Northampton.

Buckingham had named his wife Anne sole executrix of his will. She was instructed to provide 200 marks to any clergy who attended his funeral, the remainder being distributed as poor relief. She was also to organise the establishment of two chantries in his memory and, says Barbara Harriss, he left &quot;exceedingly elaborate&quot; instructions for the augmentation of Pleshy college.

== Aftermath ==
Michael Hicks has noted that Buckingham was one of the few Lancastrian loyalists who was never accused by the Yorkists of being an &quot;evil councillor&quot;, even though he was—in Hicks&#x27;s words—&quot;the substance and perhaps the steel within the ruling regime&quot;. Although Buckingham was not attainted when the Duke of York&#x27;s son, Edward, Earl of March, took the throne as King Edward IV in 1461, Buckingham&#x27;s grandson Henry became a royal ward, which gave the King control of the Stafford estates during the young duke&#x27;s minority. Henry Stafford entered into his estates in 1473 but was executed by Edward&#x27;s brother Richard—by then King, and against whom Henry had rebelled—in November 1483.

== Character ==
Humphrey Stafford has been described as something of a in his youth, and later in life he was a staunch anti-Lollard. Lustig suggests that it was probably in connection to this that Sir Thomas Malory attempted his assassination around 1450—if indeed he did, as the charge was never proved. Buckingham did not lack the traits traditionally expected of the nobility in this period of the time, particularly, in dispute resolution, that of resorting to violence as a first rather than last resort. For instance, in September 1429, following an altercation with his brother-in-law the Earl of Huntingdon, he arrived at parliament fully armed. On the other hand, he was also a literary patron: Lord Scrope presented him with a copy of Christine de Pizan&#x27;s &quot;Epistle of Othea&quot;, demonstrating his position as a &quot;powerful and potentially powerful patron&quot;, and its dedicatory verse to Buckingham is particularly laudatory. On Buckingham&#x27;s estates—especially on the Welsh marches—he has been described as a &quot;harsh and exacting landlord&quot; in the lengths he went to in maximising his income. He was also competent in his land deals, and seems never—unlike some contemporaries—to have had to sell land to stay solvent.

B. J. Harris noted that, although he died a staunch Lancastrian, he never showed any personal dislike of York in the 1450s, and that his personal motivation throughout the decade was loyalty to the Crown and keeping the peace between his peers. Rawcliffe has suggested that although he was inevitably going to be involved in the high politics of the day, Buckingham &quot;lacked the necessary qualities ever to become a great statesman or leader ... [he] was in many ways an unimaginative and unlikeable man&quot;. On the latter quality, Rawcliffe points to his reputation as a harsh taskmaster on his estates and his &quot;offensive behaviour&quot; towards Joan of Arc. Further, she says, his political judgement could be clouded by his attitude. His temper, she says, was &quot;ungovernable&quot;.

== Family ==
Humphrey Stafford married Lady Anne Neville, daughter of Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmorland, by Lady Joan Beaufort (Westmorland&#x27;s second wife), at some point before 18 October 1424. Anne Neville was a literary patron in her own right, also receiving a dedication in a copy of Scrope&#x27;s translated &quot;Othea&quot;. On her death in 1480, she left many books in her will. Scholars generally agree that Buckingham and Anne had twelve children, consisting of seven sons and five daughters. Sources conflict over the precise details of the Staffords&#x27; progeny. The antiquarian I. W. Dunham, writing in 1907, listed them as Humphrey, Henry, John, Anne (married Aubrey de Vere), Joan (married Viscount Beaumont before 1461), Elizabeth, Margaret (born about 1435, married Robert Dinham), and Katherine (married John Talbot, the future 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, before 1467). James Tait lists the daughters as Anne, Joan, Elizabeth, Margaret and Catherine and suggests that Elizabeth and Margaret never married. Rawcliffe gives the following as dates of birth and death for three of the daughters: Anne, 1446–1472; Joan, 1442–1484; and Katherine, 1437–1476. Edward and the twins, George and William, died young. The seventh son has gone unremarked in the sources.
The marriages Buckingham arranged for his children were structured around strengthening his ties to the Lancastrian royal family. Of particular importance were the marriages of two of his sons, Humphrey and Henry. They married into the Beaufort family, which was descended from the illegitimate children of John of Gaunt and thus of royal blood. There was also, about 1450, discussion regarding a proposal for one of Buckingham&#x27;s daughters to marry the Dauphin of France (subsequently Louis XI). Had it proceeded, it would have again linked the French Crown with the Lancastrian regime.

Buckingham&#x27;s eldest son, Humphrey, married Margaret Beaufort. She was the daughter of Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, and Eleanor Beauchamp. Margaret and Humphrey&#x27;s son was Buckingham&#x27;s eventual heir. A second link to the Beaufort family was between Buckingham&#x27;s second son, Sir Henry Stafford (c. 1425–1471), who became the third husband of Lady Margaret Beaufort, daughter of John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, and Margaret Beauchamp. Margaret Beaufort had previously been married to Edmund Tudor, the eldest half-brother of Henry VI, and had given birth to the future King Henry VII two months after Edmund&#x27;s death. She and Henry were childless. Buckingham&#x27;s third surviving son, John (died 8 May 1473) married Constance Green of Drayton, who had previously been the duke&#x27;s ward. Humphrey Stafford assigned them the manor of Newton Blossomville at the time of their marriage. John was created Earl of Wiltshire in 1470.

Buckingham arranged good but costly marriages for three of his daughters. Anne married Aubrey de Vere, son of John de Vere, Earl of Oxford. Their 1452 marriage cost Buckingham 2,300 marks; he was slow to pay, and still owed Oxford over £440 seven years later. In 1452, Joan married William Beaumont, heir of Viscount Beaumont. Katherine married John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, six years later. Buckingham had apparently promised to give them £1,000 but died before acting on the promise.

== Cultural references and portrayals ==
Buckingham was depicted, during his son&#x27;s lifetime, &quot;mounted in battle array&quot;—showing him during the 1436 campaign against Burgundy—in the pictorial genealogy, the &quot;Beauchamp Pageant&quot;.

Timothy J. Lustig has suggested that Thomas Malory, in his &quot;Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, based his character Gawaine on Buckingham. Lustig suggests that Malory may have viewed the Duke as being &quot;peacemaker and warlord, warrior and judge&quot;—qualities which the writer also ascribed to his Arthurian character. Buckingham appears in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot; (c. 1591), in which his character conspires in the downfall and disgrace of Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester.

According to Martin Wiggins of the Shakespeare Institute, Buckingham may be the eponymous character of the early-17th-century play, &quot;Duke Humphrey&quot;, which is now lost. However, the lost play could instead have been about the equally eventful career of Prince Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester (1390–1447), the youngest son of Henry IV of England.

<doc id="245173" wikidata="Q130958" url="?curid=245173" title="Great Sphinx of Giza">
<text>The Great Sphinx of Giza is a limestone statue of a reclining sphinx, a mythical creature with the head of a human and the body of a lion. Facing directly from west to east, it stands on the Giza Plateau on the west bank of the Nile in Giza, Egypt. The face of the Sphinx appears to represent the pharaoh Khafre. The original shape of the Sphinx was cut from bedrock, and has since been restored with layers of limestone blocks. It measures long from paw to tail, high from the base to the top of the head and wide at its rear haunches.

The Sphinx is the oldest known monumental sculpture in Egypt and one of the most recognizable statues in the world. The archaeological evidence suggests that it was created by ancient Egyptians of the Old Kingdom during the reign of Khafre ().

The circumstances surrounding the Sphinx&#x27;s nose being broken off are uncertain, but close inspection suggests a deliberate act using rods or chisels. Contrary to a popular myth, it was not broken off by cannonfire from Napoleon&#x27;s troops during his 1798 Egyptian campaign. Its absence is in fact depicted in artwork predating Napoleon and referred to in descriptions by the 15th-century historian al-Maqrīzī.

== Names ==
The original name the Old Kingdom creators gave the Sphinx is unknown, as the Sphinx temple, enclosure, and possibly the Sphinx itself was not completed at the time, and thus little is known about its cultural context. In the New Kingdom, the Sphinx was revered as the solar deity &quot;Hor-em-akhet&quot; (; Hellenized: &quot;Harmachis&quot;), and the pharaoh Thutmose IV (1401–1391 or 1397–1388 BC) specifically referred to it as such in his Dream Stele.

The commonly used name &quot;Sphinx&quot; was given to it in classical antiquity, around 2,000 years after the commonly accepted date of its construction by reference to a Greek mythological beast with the head of a woman, a falcon, a cat, or a sheep and the body of a lion with the wings of an eagle (although, like most Egyptian sphinxes, the Great Sphinx has a man&#x27;s head and no wings). The English word &quot;sphinx&quot; comes from the ancient Greek Σφίγξ ( ) apparently from the verb σφίγγω ( / ), after the Greek sphinx who strangled anyone who failed to answer her riddle.

Medieval Arab writers, including al-Maqrīzī, call the Sphinx by an Arabized Coptic name &quot;Belhib&quot; (), &quot;Balhubah&quot; () &quot;Belhawiyya (&quot;), which in turn comes from &quot;Pehor&quot; () or &quot;Pehor(o)n&quot; (), a name of the Canaanite god Hauron with whom the Sphinx was identified. It is also rendered as &quot;Ablehon&quot; on a depiction of the Sphinx made by François de La Boullaye-Le Gouz. The modern Egyptian Arabic name is أبو الهول (&quot;ʼabu alhōl / ʼabu alhawl&quot; , &quot;The Terrifying One&quot;; literally &quot;Father of Dread&quot;) which is a phono-semantic matching of the Coptic name.

== History ==

=== Old Kingdom ===
The archaeological evidence suggests that the Great Sphinx was created around 2500 BC for the king Khafre, the builder of the Second Pyramid at Giza. The Sphinx is a monolith carved from the bedrock of the plateau, which also served as the quarry for the pyramids and other monuments in the area. Egyptian geologist Farouk El-Baz has suggested that the head of the Sphinx may have been carved first, out of a natural yardang, i.e. a ridge of bedrock that had been sculpted by the wind. These can sometimes achieve shapes that resemble animals. El-Baz suggests that the &quot;moat&quot; or &quot;ditch&quot; around the Sphinx may have been quarried out later to allow for the creation of the full body of the sculpture. 
The stones cut from around the Sphinx&#x27;s body were used to construct a temple in front of it; however, neither the enclosure nor the temple were ever completed, and the relative scarcity of Old Kingdom cultural material suggests that a Sphinx cult was not established at the time. Selim Hassan, writing in 1949 on recent excavations of the Sphinx enclosure, made note of this circumstance:

In order to construct the temple, the northern perimeter-wall of the Khafre Valley Temple had to be deconstructed, hence it follows that the Khafre funerary complex preceded the creation of the Sphinx and its temple. Furthermore, the angle and location of the south wall of the enclosure suggests the causeway connecting Khafre&#x27;s Pyramid and Valley Temple already existed before the Sphinx was planned. The lower base level of the Sphinx temple also indicates that it does not pre-date the Valley Temple.

=== New Kingdom ===

Some time around the First Intermediate Period, the Giza Necropolis was abandoned, and drifting sand eventually buried the Sphinx up to its shoulders. The first documented attempt at an excavation dates to , when the young Thutmose IV (1401–1391 or 1397–1388 BC) gathered a team and, after much effort, managed to dig out the front paws, between which he erected a shrine that housed the Dream Stele, an inscribed granite slab (possibly a repurposed door lintel from one of Khafre&#x27;s temples). When the stele was discovered, its lines of text were already damaged and incomplete. An excerpt reads:
The Dream Stele associates the Sphinx with Khafre. However, this part of the text is not entirely intact:

Egyptologist Thomas Young, finding the &quot;Khaf&quot; hieroglyphs in a damaged cartouche used to surround a royal name, inserted the glyph &quot;ra&quot; to complete Khafre&#x27;s name. When the Stele was re-excavated in 1925, the lines of text referring to &quot;Khaf&quot; flaked off and were destroyed.

Later, Ramesses II the Great (1279–1213 BC) may have undertaken a second excavation.

In the New Kingdom, the Sphinx became more specifically associated with the sun god &quot;Hor-em-akhet&quot; (Hellenized: &quot;Harmachis&quot;) or &quot;Horus-at-the-Horizon&quot;. The Pharaoh Amenhotep II (1427–1401 or 1397 BC) built a temple to the northeast of the Sphinx nearly 1,000 years after its construction and dedicated it to the cult of &quot;Hor-em-akhet&quot;.

=== Graeco-Roman period ===

In Graeco-Roman times, Giza had become a tourist destination—the monuments were regarded as antiquities—and some Roman Emperors visited the Sphinx out of curiosity, and for political reasons.

The Sphinx was cleared of sand again in the first century AD in honor of Emperor Nero and the Governor of Egypt Tiberius Claudius Balbilus. A monumental stairway—more than wide—was erected, leading to a pavement in front of the paws of the Sphinx. At the top of the stairs, a podium was positioned that allowed a view into the Sphinx sanctuary. Farther back, another podium neighbored several more steps. The stairway was dismantled during the 1931–32 excavations by Émile Baraize.

Pliny the Elder describes the face of the Sphinx being colored red and gives measurements for the statue:

A stela dated to 166 AD commemorates the restoration of the retaining walls surrounding the Sphinx. The last Emperor connected with the monument is Septimius Severus, around 200 AD. With the downfall of Roman power, the Sphinx was once more engulfed by the sands.

=== Middle Ages ===
Some ancient non-Egyptians saw the Sphinx as a likeness of the god Hauron. The cult of the Sphinx continued into medieval times. The Sabians of Harran saw it as the burial place of Hermes Trismegistus. Arab authors described the Sphinx as a talisman that guarded the area from the desert. Al-Maqrizi describes it as the &quot;talisman of the Nile&quot; that the locals believed the flood cycle depended upon. Muhammad al-Idrisi stated that those wishing to obtain bureaucratic positions in the Egyptian government gave incense offering to the monument.

===Early modern period===
Over the centuries, writers and scholars have recorded their impressions and reactions upon seeing the Sphinx. The vast majority were concerned with a general description, often including a mixture of science, romance and mystique. A typical description of the Sphinx by tourists and leisure travelers throughout the 19th and 20th century was made by John Lawson Stoddard:

From the 16th to the 19th centuries, European observers described the Sphinx having the face, neck and breast of a woman. Examples included Johannes Helferich (1579), George Sandys (1615), Johann Michael Vansleb (1677), Benoît de Maillet (1735) and Elliot Warburton (1844).

Most early Western images were book illustrations in print form, elaborated by a professional engraver from either previous images available or some original drawing or sketch supplied by an author, and usually now lost. Seven years after visiting Giza, André Thévet (&quot;Cosmographie de Levant&quot;, 1556) described the Sphinx as &quot;the head of a colossus, caused to be made by Isis, daughter of Inachus, then so beloved of Jupiter&quot;. He, or his artist and engraver, pictured it as a curly-haired monster with a grassy dog collar. Athanasius Kircher (who never visited Egypt) depicted the Sphinx as a Roman statue (&quot;Turris Babel&quot;, 1679). Johannes Helferich&#x27;s (1579) Sphinx is a pinched-face, round-breasted woman with a straight haired wig. George Sandys stated that the Sphinx was a harlot; Balthasar de Monconys interpreted the headdress as a kind of hairnet, while François de La Boullaye-Le Gouz&#x27;s Sphinx had a rounded hairdo with bulky collar.

Richard Pococke&#x27;s Sphinx was an adoption of Cornelis de Bruijn&#x27;s drawing of 1698, featuring only minor changes, but is closer to the actual appearance of the Sphinx than anything previous. The print versions of Norden&#x27;s drawings for his &quot;Voyage d&#x27;Egypte et de Nubie&quot;, 1755 clearly show that the nose was missing.

=== Modern excavations ===

In 1817, the first modern archaeological dig, supervised by the Italian Giovanni Battista Caviglia, uncovered the Sphinx&#x27;s chest completely.

One of the people working on clearing the sands from around the Great Sphinx was Eugène Grébaut, a French Director of the Antiquities Service.

=== Opinions of early Egyptologists ===
Early Egyptologists and excavators were of divided opinion regarding the age of the Sphinx and the associated temples.

In 1857, Auguste Mariette, founder of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, unearthed the much later Inventory Stela (estimated to be from the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, c. 664–525 BC), which tells how Khufu came upon the Sphinx, already buried in sand. Although certain tracts on the Stela are likely accurate, this passage is contradicted by archaeological evidence, thus considered to be Late Period historical revisionism, a purposeful fake, created by the local priests as an attempt to imbue the contemporary Isis temple with an ancient history it never had. Such acts became common when religious institutions such as temples, shrines and priests&#x27; domains were fighting for political attention and for financial and economic donations.

Flinders Petrie wrote in 1883 regarding the state of opinion of the age of the Khafre Valley Temple, and by extension the Sphinx: &quot;The date of the Granite Temple has been so positively asserted to be earlier than the fourth dynasty, that it may seem rash to dispute the point. Recent discoveries, however, strongly show that it was really not built before the reign of Khafre, in the fourth dynasty.&quot;

Gaston Maspero, the French Egyptologist and second director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, conducted a survey of the Sphinx in 1886. He concluded that because the Dream Stela showed the cartouche of Khafre in line 13, it was he who was responsible for the excavation and therefore the Sphinx must predate Khafre and his predecessors—possibly Fourth Dynasty, . Maspero believed the Sphinx to be &quot;the most ancient monument in Egypt&quot;.

Ludwig Borchardt attributed the Sphinx to the Middle Kingdom, arguing that the particular features seen on the Sphinx are unique to the 12th dynasty and that the Sphinx resembles Amenemhat III.

E. A. Wallis Budge agreed that the Sphinx predated Khafre&#x27;s reign, writing in &quot;The Gods of the Egyptians&quot; (1904): &quot;This marvelous object [the Great Sphinx] was in existence in the days of Khafre, or Khephren, and it is probable that it is a very great deal older than his reign and that it dates from the end of the archaic period [].&quot;

Selim Hassan reasoned that the Sphinx was erected after the completion of the Khafre pyramid complex.

=== Modern dissenting hypotheses ===
Rainer Stadelmann, former director of the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo, examined the distinct iconography of the &quot;nemes&quot; (headdress) and the now-detached beard of the Sphinx and concluded the style is more indicative of the pharaoh Khufu (2589–2566 BC), known to the Greeks as Cheops, builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza and Khafre&#x27;s father. He supports this by suggesting Khafre&#x27;s Causeway was built to conform to a pre-existing structure, which, he concludes, given its location, could only have been the Sphinx.

In 2004, Vassil Dobrev of the Institut Français d&#x27;Archéologie Orientale in Cairo announced he had uncovered new evidence that the Great Sphinx may have been the work of the little-known pharaoh Djedefre (2528–2520 BC), Khafre&#x27;s half brother and a son of Khufu. Dobrev suggests Djedefre built the Sphinx in the image of his father Khufu, identifying him with the sun god Ra in order to restore respect for their dynasty. Dobrev also says that the causeway connecting Khafre&#x27;s pyramid to the temples was built around the Sphinx, suggesting it was already in existence at the time. Egyptologist Nigel Strudwick responded to Dobrev saying that: &quot;It is not implausible. But I would need more explanation, such as why he thinks the pyramid at Abu Roash is a sun temple, something I&#x27;m sceptical about. I have never heard anyone suggest that the name in the graffiti at Zawiyet el-Aryan mentions Djedefre. I remain more convinced by the traditional argument of [the sphinx] being Khafre or the more recent theory of it being Khufu.&quot;

Geologist Colin Reader suggests that water runoff from the Giza plateau is responsible for the differential erosion on the walls of the sphinx enclosure. Because the hydrological characteristics of the area were significantly changed by the quarries, he contends this suggests that the sphinx likely predated the quarries (and thus, the pyramids). He points towards the larger cyclopean stones in part of the Sphinx Temple, as well as the causeway alignment with the pyramids and the break in the quarries, as evidence that the pyramids took the alignment with some pre-existing structure, such as the sphinx, into consideration when they were constructed, and that the sphinx temple was built in two distinct phases. He contends that such erosion could have occurred relatively rapidly and suggests that the sphinx was no more than a few centuries older than present archaeology would suggest, suggesting a late Predynastic or Early Dynastic origin, when Ancient Egyptians already were known to be capable of sophisticated masonry.

=== Recent restorations ===
In 1931, engineers of the Egyptian government repaired the head of the Sphinx. Part of its headdress had fallen off in 1926 due to erosion, which had also cut deeply into its neck. This questionable repair was by the addition of a concrete collar between the headdress and the neck, creating an altered profile. Many renovations to the stone base and raw rock body were done in the 1980s, and then redone in the 1990s.

== Degradation and violation ==
The nummulitic limestone of the area consists of layers which offer differing resistance to erosion (mostly caused by wind and windblown sand), leading to the uneven degradation apparent in the Sphinx&#x27;s body. The lowest part of the body, including the legs, is solid rock. The body of the animal up to its neck is fashioned from softer layers that have suffered considerable disintegration. The layer in which the head was sculpted is much harder.

A number of &quot;dead-end&quot; shafts are known to exist within and below the body of the Great Sphinx, most likely dug by treasure hunters and tomb robbers.

=== Missing nose ===

Examination of the Sphinx&#x27;s face shows that long rods or chisels were hammered into the nose area, one down from the bridge and another beneath the nostril, then used to pry the nose off towards the south, resulting in the one-metre wide nose still being lost to date. Many folk tales exist regarding the destruction of its nose, aiming to provide an answer as to where it went or what happened to it. One tale erroneously attributes it to cannonballs fired by the army of Napoleon Bonaparte. This is considered false since drawings of the Sphinx by Frederic Louis Norden in 1737 already show the nose missing, predating Napoleon&#x27;s arrival by sixty years.

The damaged nose has also been attributed by some 10th century Arab authors stating that it was a result of iconoclastic attacks. Besides this, there was also mention of the damage being the work of the Mamluks in the 14th century. According to Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Muhammad ibn Sadiq ibn al-Muhammad al-Tibrizi al-Masri (d. 1384), desecrated the sphinxes of &quot;Qanatir al-Siba&quot;.

The Arab historian al-Maqrīzī, writing in the early 15th century, attributes the loss of the nose to Muhammad Sa&#x27;im al-Dahr, a Sufi Muslim from the khanqah of Sa&#x27;id al-Su&#x27;ada in 1378, who found local peasants making offerings to the Sphinx in the hope of increasing their harvest and therefore defaced the Sphinx in an act of iconoclasm. According to al-Maqrīzī, many people living in the area believed that the increased sand covering the Giza Plateau was retribution for al-Dahr&#x27;s act of defacement. Al-Minufi (1443–1527) meanwhile mentioned that the Alexandrian Crusade in 1365 was divine retribution for Muhammad Sa&#x27;im al-Dahr&#x27;s breaking off the nose of a sphinx.
=== Beard ===
In addition to the lost nose, a ceremonial pharaonic beard is thought to have been attached, although this may have been added in later periods after the original construction. Egyptologist Vassil Dobrev has suggested that had the beard been an original part of the Sphinx, it would have damaged the chin of the statue upon falling.

Residues of red pigment are visible on areas of the Sphinx&#x27;s face and traces of yellow and blue pigment have also been found elsewhere on the Sphinx, leading Mark Lehner to suggest that the monument &quot;was once decked out in gaudy comic book colours&quot;.

== Holes and tunnels ==
=== Hole in the Sphinx&#x27;s head ===
Johann Helffrich visited the Sphinx during his travels in 1565–1566. He describes that a priest went into the head of the Sphinx, and when he spoke it was as if the Sphinx itself was speaking.

Many New Kingdom stelae depict the Sphinx wearing a crown. If it in fact existed, the hole could have been the anchoring point for it.

Émile Baraize closed the hole with a metal hatch in 1926.

=== Perring&#x27;s Hole ===

Howard Vyse directed John Shae Perring in 1837 to drill a tunnel in the back of the Sphinx, just behind the head. The boring rods became stuck at a depth of . Attempts to blast the rods free caused further damage. The hole was cleared in 1978. Among the rubble was a fragment of the Sphinx&#x27;s nemes headdress.

==== Major fissure ====
A major natural fissure in the bedrock cuts through the waist of the Sphinx, first excavated by Auguste Mariette in 1853.

At the top of the back it measures up to in width. Baraize, in 1926, sealed the sides and roofed it with iron bars, limestone and cement, and installed an iron trap door at the top. The sides of the fissure might have been artificially squared; however, the bottom is irregular bedrock, about above the outside floor. A very narrow crack continues deeper.

=== Rump passage ===
In 1926, the Sphinx was cleared of sand under direction of Baraize, which revealed an opening to a tunnel at floor-level at the north side of the rump. It was subsequently closed by masonry veneer and nearly forgotten.

More than fifty years later, the existence of the passage was recalled by three elderly men who had worked during the clearing as basket carriers. This led to the rediscovery and excavation of the rump passage, in 1980.

The passage consists of an upper and a lower section, which are angled roughly 90 degrees to each other:

* The upper part ascends to a height of above the ground-floor at a northwest direction. It runs between masonry veneer and the core body of the Sphinx and ends in a niche wide and high. The ceiling of the niche consists of modern cement, which likely spilled down from the filling of the gap between masonry and core bedrock, some above
* The lower part descends steeply into the bedrock toward northeast, for a distance of approximately and a depth of . It terminated in a cul-de-sac pit at groundwater level. At the entrance it is wide, narrowing to about towards the end. Among the sand and stone fragments, a piece of tin foil and the base of a modern ceramic water jar was found. The clogged bottom contained modern fill. Among it, more tin foil, modern cement and a pair of shoes

It is possible that the entire passage was cut top down, beginning high up on the rump, and that the current access point at floor-level was made at a later date.

Vyse noted in his diary (February 27 and 28, 1837) that he was &quot;boring&quot; near the tail, which indicates him as the creator of the passage, as no other tunnel has been identified at this location. Another interpretation is that the shaft is of ancient origin, perhaps an exploratory tunnel or an unfinished tomb shaft.


=== Niche in northern flank ===
A 1925 photograph shows a man standing below floor level in a niche in the Sphinx&#x27;s core body. It was closed during the 1925–1926 restorations.

=== Gap under southern large masonry box ===
Another hole might have been at floor level in the large masonry box on the south side of the Sphinx.

=== Space behind Dream Stele ===
The space behind the Dream Stele, between the paws of the Sphinx, was covered by an iron beam and cement roof, which was fitted with an iron trap door.

=== Keyhole Shaft ===
At the ledge of the Sphinx enclosure, a square shaft is located opposite the northern hind paw. It was cleared during excavation in 1978 by Hawass and measures and about deep. Lehner interprets the shaft to be an unfinished tomb and named it &quot;Keyhole Shaft&quot;, because of cuttings in the ledge above the shaft that are shaped like the lower part of a traditional (Victorian era) keyhole, upside down.

== Pseudohistory ==
Numerous ideas have been suggested to explain or reinterpret the origin and identity of the Sphinx, that lack sufficient evidential support and/or are contradicted by such, and are therefore considered part of pseudohistory and pseudoarchaeology.

=== Ancient Astronauts/Atlantis ===
* The Sphinx is oriented from west to east, towards the rising sun, in accordance with the ancient Egyptian solar cult. The Orion correlation theory posits that it was instead aligned to face the constellation of Leo during the vernal equinox around 10,500 BC. The idea is considered pseudoarchaeology by academia, because no textual or archaeological evidence supports this to be the reason for the orientation of the Sphinx
* The Sphinx water erosion hypothesis contends that the main type of weathering evident on the enclosure walls of the Great Sphinx could only have been caused by prolonged and extensive rainfall, and must therefore predate the time of the pharaoh Khafre. The hypothesis was championed by René Schwaller de Lubicz, John Anthony West, and geologist Robert M. Schoch. The theory is considered pseudoarchaeology by mainstream scholarship due to archaeological, climatological and geological evidence to the contrary.
* There is a long history of speculation about hidden chambers beneath the Sphinx, by esoteric figures such as H. Spencer Lewis. Edgar Cayce specifically predicted in the 1930s that a &quot;Hall of Records&quot;, containing knowledge from Atlantis, would be discovered under the Sphinx in 1998. His prediction fueled much of the fringe speculation that surrounded the Sphinx in the 1990s, which lost momentum when the hall was not found when predicted
* Author Robert K. G. Temple proposes that the Sphinx was originally a statue of the jackal god Anubis, the god of funerals, and that its face was recarved in the likeness of a Middle Kingdom pharaoh, Amenemhet II. Temple bases his identification on the style of the eye make-up and style of the pleats on the headdress

=== Racial characteristics ===

Until the early 20th century, it was suggested that the face of the Sphinx had &quot;Negroid&quot; characteristics, as part of the now outdated historical race concepts.

<text>The geothermal areas of Yellowstone include several geyser basins in Yellowstone National Park as well as other geothermal features such as hot springs, mud pots, and fumaroles. The number of thermal features in Yellowstone is estimated at 10,000. A study that was completed in 2011 found that a total of 1,283 geysers have erupted in Yellowstone, 465 of which are active during an average year. These are distributed among nine geyser basins, with a few geysers found in smaller thermal areas throughout the Park. The number of geysers in each geyser basin are as follows: Upper Geyser Basin (410), Midway Geyser Basin (59), Lower Geyser Basin (283), Norris Geyser Basin (193), West Thumb Geyser Basin (84), Gibbon Geyser Basin (24), Lone Star Geyser Basin (21), Shoshone Geyser Basin (107), Heart Lake Geyser Basin (69), other areas (33). Although famous large geysers like Old Faithful are part of the total, most of Yellowstone&#x27;s geysers are small, erupting to only a foot or two. The hydrothermal system that supplies the geysers with hot water sits within an ancient active caldera. Many of the thermal features in Yellowstone build up sinter, geyserite, or travertine deposits around and within them.

The various geyser basins are located where rainwater and snowmelt can percolate into the ground, get indirectly superheated by the underlying Yellowstone hotspot, and then erupt at the surface as geysers, hot springs, and fumaroles. Thus flat-bottomed valleys between ancient lava flows and glacial moraines are where most of the large geothermal areas are located. Smaller geothermal areas can be found where fault lines reach the surface, in places along the circular fracture zone around the caldera, and at the base of slopes that collect excess groundwater. Due to the Yellowstone Plateau&#x27;s high elevation the average boiling temperature at Yellowstone&#x27;s geyser basins is 199 °F (93 °C). When properly confined and close to the surface it can periodically release some of the built-up pressure in eruptions of hot water and steam that can reach up to 390 feet (120 m) into the air (see Steamboat Geyser, the world&#x27;s tallest geyser). Water erupting from Yellowstone&#x27;s geysers is superheated above that boiling point to an average of 204 °F (95.5 °C) as it leaves the vent. The water cools significantly while airborne and is no longer scalding hot by the time it strikes the ground, nearby boardwalks, or even spectators. Because of the high temperatures of the water in the features it is important that spectators remain on the boardwalks and designated trails. Several deaths have occurred in the park as a result of falls into hot springs.

Prehistoric Native American artifacts have been found at Mammoth Hot Springs and other geothermal areas in Yellowstone. Some accounts state that the early people used hot water from the geothermal features for bathing and cooking. In the 19th century Father Pierre-Jean De Smet reported that natives he interviewed thought that geyser eruptions were &quot;the result of combat between the infernal spirits&quot;. The Lewis and Clark Expedition traveled north of the Yellowstone area in 1806. Local natives that they came upon seldom dared to enter what we now know is the caldera because of frequent loud noises that sounded like thunder and the belief that the spirits that possessed the area did not like human intrusion into their realm. The first white man known to travel into the caldera and see the geothermal features was John Colter, who had left the Lewis and Clark Expedition. He described what he saw as &quot;hot spring brimstone&quot;. Beaver trapper Joseph Meek recounted in 1830 that the steam rising from the various geyser basins reminded him of smoke coming from industrial smokestacks on a cold winter morning in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In the 1850s famed trapper Jim Bridger called it &quot;the place where Hell bubbled up&quot;.

==Types of features found in the park==
The heat that drives geothermal activity in the Yellowstone area comes from brine (salty water) that is below the surface. This is actually below the solid volcanic rock and sediment that extends to a depth of 3,000 to 6,000 feet (900 to 1,800 m) and is &quot;inside&quot; the hot but mostly solid part of the pluton that contains Yellowstone&#x27;s magma chamber. At that depth the brine is superheated to temperatures that exceed but is able to remain a liquid because it is under great pressure (like a huge pressure cooker).

Convection of the churning brine and conduction from surrounding rock transfers heat to an overlaying layer of fresh groundwater. Movement of the two liquids is facilitated by the highly fractured and porous nature of the rocks under the Yellowstone Plateau. Some silica is dissolved from the fractured rhyolite into the hot water as it travels through the fractured rock. Part of this hard mineral is later redeposited on the walls of the cracks and fissures to make a nearly pressure-tight system. Silica precipitates at the surface to form either geyserite or sinter, creating the massive geyser cones, the scalloped edges of hot springs, and the seemingly barren landscape of geyser basins.

There are at least five types of geothermal features found at Yellowstone:
* Fumaroles: Fumaroles, or steam vents, are the hottest hydrothermal features in the park. They have so little water that it all flashes into steam before reaching the surface. At places like Roaring Mountain, the result is loud hissing of steam and gases.
* Geysers: Geysers such as Old Faithful are a type of geothermal feature that periodically erupt scalding hot water. Increased pressure exerted by the enormous weight of the overlying rock and water prevents deeper water from boiling. As the hot water rises it is under less pressure and steam bubbles form. They, in turn, expand on their ascent until the bubbles are too big and numerous to pass freely through constrictions. At a critical point the confined bubbles actually lift the water above, causing the geyser to splash or overflow. This decreases the pressure of the system and violent boiling results. Large quantities of water flash into tremendous amounts of steam that force a jet of water out of the vent: an eruption begins. Water (and heat) is expelled faster than the geyser&#x27;s recharge rate, gradually decreasing the system&#x27;s pressure and eventually ending the eruption.
* Hot springs: Hot springs such as Grand Prismatic Spring are the most common hydrothermal features in the park. Their plumbing has no constrictions. Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below. This circulation, called convection, prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption. Many hot springs give rise to streams of heated water.
* Mudpots: Mudpots such as Fountain Paint Pots are acidic hot springs with a limited water supply. Some microorganisms use hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg smell), which rises from deep within the earth, as an energy source. They convert the gas into sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock into clay.
* Travertine terraces: Travertine terraces, found at Mammoth Hot Springs, are formed from limestone (a rock type made of calcium carbonate). Thermal waters rise through the limestone, carrying high amounts of dissolved carbonate. Carbon dioxide is released at the surface and calcium carbonate deposited as travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. These features constantly and quickly change due to the rapid rate of deposition.

==Geyser basins==

===Norris Geyser Basin===


The Norris Geyser Basin is the hottest geyser basin in the park and is located near the northwest edge of Yellowstone Caldera near Norris Junction and on the intersection of three major faults. The Norris-Mammoth Corridor is a fault that runs from Norris north through Mammoth to the Gardiner, Montana, area. The Hebgen Lake fault runs from northwest of West Yellowstone, Montana, to Norris. This fault experienced an earthquake in 1959 that measured 7.4 on the Richter scale (sources vary on exact magnitude between 7.1 and 7.8; see 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake). Norris Geyser Basin is so hot and dynamic because these two faults intersect with the ring fracture zone that resulted from the creation of the Yellowstone Caldera of 640,000 years ago.

The Basin consists of three main areas: Porcelain Basin, Back Basin, and One Hundred Springs Plain. Unlike most of other geyser basins in the park, the waters from Norris are acidic rather than alkaline (for example, Echinus Geyser has a pH of approximately 3.5). The difference in pH allows for a different class of bacterial thermophiles to live at Norris, creating different color patterns in and around the Norris Basin waters.

The Ragged Hills that lie between Back Basin and One Hundred Springs Plain are thermally altered glacial kames. As glaciers receded the underlying thermal features began to express themselves once again, melting remnants of the ice and causing masses of debris to be dumped. These debris piles were then altered by steam and hot water flowing through them. Madison lies within the eroded stream channels cut through lava flows formed after the caldera eruption. The Gibbon Falls lies on the caldera boundary as does Virginia Cascades.
The tallest active geyser in the world, Steamboat Geyser, is located in Norris Basin. Unlike the slightly smaller but much more famous Old Faithful Geyser located in Upper Geyser Basin, Steamboat has an erratic and lengthy timetable between major eruptions. During major eruptions, which may be separated by intervals of more than a year (the longest recorded span between major eruptions was 50 years), Steamboat erupts over into the air. Steamboat does not lie dormant between eruptions, instead displaying minor eruptions of approximately .

Norris Geyser Basin periodically undergoes a large-scale, basin-wide thermal disturbance lasting a few weeks. Water levels fluctuate, and temperatures, pH, colors, and eruptive patterns change throughout the basin. During a disturbance in 1985, Porkchop Geyser continually jetted steam and water; in 1989, the same geyser apparently clogged with silica and blew up, throwing rocks more than . In 2003 a park ranger observed it bubbling heavily, the first such activity seen since 1991. Activity increased dramatically in mid-2003. Because of high ground temperatures and new features beside the trail much of Back Basin was closed until October. In 2004 the boardwalk was routed around the dangerous area and now leads behind Porkchop Geyser.

North of Norris, Roaring Mountain is a large, acidic hydrothermal area (solfatara) with many fumaroles. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the number, size, and power of the fumaroles were much greater than today. The fumaroles are most easily seen in the cooler, low-light conditions of morning and evening.

===Gibbon Geyser Basin===
The Gibbon Geyser Basin includes several thermal areas in the vicinity of the Gibbon River between Gibbon Falls and Norris. The most accessible feature in the basin is Beryl Spring, with a small boardwalk right along the Grand Loop Road. Artists&#x27; Paintpots is a small hydrothermal area south of Norris Junction that includes colorful hot springs and two large mudpots.

The Monument Geyser Basin has no active geysers, but its &#x27;monuments&#x27; are siliceous sinter deposits similar to the siliceous spires discovered on the floor of Yellowstone Lake. Scientists hypothesize that this basin&#x27;s structures formed from a hot water system in a glacially dammed lake during the waning stages of the Pinedale Glaciation. The basin is on a ridge reached by a very steep one-mile (1.6 km) trail south of Artists&#x27; Paint Pots. Other areas of thermal activity in Gibbon Geyser Basin lie off-trail.

===Upper Geyser Basin===
South of Norris along the rim of the caldera is the Upper Geyser Basin , which has the highest concentration of geothermal features in the park. This complement of features includes the most famous geyser in the park, Old Faithful Geyser, as well as four other predictable large geysers. One of these large geysers in the area is Castle Geyser which is about northwest of Old Faithful. Castle Geyser has an interval of approximately 13 hours between major eruptions, but is unpredictable after minor eruptions. The other three predictable geysers are Grand Geyser, Daisy Geyser, and Riverside Geyser. Biscuit Basin and Black Sand Basin are also within the boundaries of Upper Geyser Basin.

The hills surrounding Old Faithful and the Upper Geyser Basin are reminders of Quaternary rhyolitic lava flows. These flows, occurring long after the catastrophic eruption of 640,000 years ago, flowed across the landscape like stiff mounds of bread dough due to their high silica content.
Evidence of glacial activity is common, and it is one of the keys that allows geysers to exist. Glacier till deposits underlie the geyser basins providing storage areas for the water used in eruptions. Many landforms, such as Porcupine Hills north of Fountain Flats, are made up of glacial gravel and are reminders that 70,000 to 14,000 years ago, this area was buried under ice.

Signs of the forces of erosion can be seen everywhere, from runoff channels carved across the sinter in the geyser basins to the drainage created by the Firehole River. Mountain building is evident on the drive south of Old Faithful, toward Craig Pass. Here the Rocky Mountains reach a height of 8,262 feet (2,518 m), dividing the country into two distinct watersheds.

===Midway Geyser Basin===

Midway Geyser Basin is much smaller than the other basins found alongside the Firehole River. Despite its small size, it contains two large features, the Excelsior Geyser which pours over per minute into the Firehole River. The largest hot spring in Yellowstone, the and Grand Prismatic Spring is found here. Also in the basin is Turquoise Pool and Opal Pool.

===Lower Geyser Basin===

Farther north is the Lower Geyser Basin , which is the largest geyser basin in area, covering approximately 11 square miles. Due to its large size, it has a much less concentrated set of geothermal features, including Fountain Paint Pots. Fountain Paint Pots are &quot;mud pots&quot;, that is, a hot spring that contains boiling mud instead of water. The mud is produced by a higher acidity in the water which enables the spring to dissolve surrounding minerals to create an opaque, usually grey, mud. Also there is Firehole Spring, Celestine Pool, Leather Pool, Red Spouter, Jelly spring, and a number of fumaroles.

Geysers in Lower Geyser Basin include Great Fountain Geyser, whose eruptions reach in the air, while waves of water cascade down its sinter terraces., the Fountain group of Geysers (Clepsydra Geyser which erupts nearly continuously to heights of , Fountain Geyser, Jelly Geyser, Jet Geyser, Morning Geyser, and Spasm Geyser), the Pink Cone group of geysers (Dilemma Geyser, Labial Geyser, Narcissus Geyser, Pink Geyser, and Pink Cone Geyser), the White Dome group of geysers (Crack Geyser, Gemini Geyser, Pebble Geyser, Rejuvenated Geyser, and White Dome Geyser), as well as Sizzler Geyser.
===West Thumb Geyser Basin===


The West Thumb Geyser Basin , including Potts Basin to the north, is the largest geyser basin on the shores of Yellowstone Lake. The heat source of the thermal features in this location is thought to be relatively close to the surface, only 10,000 feet (3,000 m) down. West Thumb is about the same size as another famous volcanic caldera, Crater Lake in Oregon, but much smaller than the great Yellowstone Caldera which last erupted about 640,000 years ago. West Thumb is a caldera within a caldera.

West Thumb was created approximately 162,000 years ago when a magma chamber bulged up under the surface of the earth and subsequently cracked it along ring fracture zones. This in turn released the enclosed magma as lava and caused the surface above the emptied magma chamber to collapse. Water later filled the collapsed area of the caldera, forming an extension of Yellowstone Lake. This created the source of heat and water that feed the West Thumb Geyser Basin today.
The thermal features at West Thumb are not only found on the lake shore, but extend under the surface of the lake as well. Several underwater hydrothermal features were discovered in the early 1990s and can be seen as slick spots or slight bulges in the summer. During the winter, the underwater thermal features are visible as melt holes in the icy surface of the lake. The surrounding ice can reach three feet (one yard) in thickness.

Perhaps the most famous hydrothermal feature at West Thumb is a geyser on the lake shore known as Fishing Cone. Walter Trumbull of the 1870 Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition described a unique event while a man was fishing adjacent to the cone: &quot;...in swinging a trout ashore, it accidentally got off the hook and fell into the spring. For a moment it darted about with wonderful rapidity, as if seeking an outlet. Then it came to the top, dead, and literally boiled.&quot; Fishing Cone erupted frequently to the height of 40 feet (12 m) in 1919 and to lesser heights in 1939. One fisherman was badly burned in Fishing Cone in 1921. Fishing at the geyser is now prohibited.

Early visitors would arrive at West Thumb via stagecoach from the Old Faithful area. They had a choice of continuing on the stagecoach or boarding the steamship &quot;Zillah&quot; to continue the journey by water to Lake Hotel. The boat dock was located near the south end of the geyser basin near Lakeside Spring.

===Backcountry Geyser Basins===



The Heart Lake , Lone Star , and Shoshone Geyser Basins are located away from the road and require at least several miles of hiking to reach. These areas lack the boardwalks and other safety features of the developed areas. As falling into geothermal features can be fatal, it is usually advisable to visit these areas with an experienced guide or at the very least, travelers need to ensure they remain on well-marked trails.

The Heart Lake Geyser Basin contains several groups of geysers and deep blue hot springs near Heart Lake in the south-central portion of Yellowstone, southeast of most of the main geyser basins. Lying in the Snake River watershed east of Lewis Lake and south of Yellowstone Lake, Heart Lake was named sometime before 1871 for Hart Hunney, a hunter. Other explorers in the region incorrectly assumed that the lake&#x27;s name was spelled &#x27;heart&#x27; because of its shape. The Heart Lake Geyser Basin begins a couple miles from the lake and descends along Witch Creek to the lakeshore. Five groups of hydrothermal features comprise the basin, and all of them contain geysers, although some are dormant.

Between Shoshone Lake and Old Faithful is the Lone Star Geyser Basin, of which the primary feature is Lone Star Geyser, named for its isolation from the nearby geysers of the Upper Geyser Basin. The basin is reachable on foot or bicycle via a 3 mile road that is closed to vehicles.

The Shoshone Geyser Basin, reached by hiking or by boat, contains one of the highest concentrations of geysers in the world – more than 80 in an area . Hot springs and mudpots dot the landscape between the geyser basin and Shoshone Lake.

Hot Spring Basin is located 15 miles (24 km) north-northeast of Fishing Bridge and has one of Yellowstone&#x27;s largest collections of hot springs and fumaroles. The geothermal features there release large amounts of sulfur. This makes water from the springs so acidic that it has dissolved holes in the pants of people who sit on wet ground and causes mounds of sulfur three feet (1 m) high to develop around fumaroles. The very hot acidic water and steam have also created voids in the ground that are only covered by a thin crust.

===Mammoth Hot Springs===

Mammoth Hot Springs is a large complex of hot springs on a hill of travertine in Yellowstone National Park adjacent to Fort Yellowstone and the Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District. It was created over thousands of years as hot water from the spring cooled and deposited calcium carbonate (over two tons flow into Mammoth each day in a solution). Because of the huge amount of geothermal vents, travertine flourishes. Although these springs lie outside the caldera boundary, their energy has been attributed to the same magmatic system that fuels other Yellowstone geothermal areas.

===Mud Volcano and Sulphur Caldron===


The thermal features at Mud Volcano and Sulphur Caldron are primarily mud pots and fumaroles because the area is situated on a perched water system with little water available. Fumaroles or &quot;steam vents&quot; occur when the ground water boils away faster than it can be recharged. Also, the vapors are rich in sulfuric acid that leaches the rock, breaking it down into clay. Because no water washes away the acid or leached rock, it remains as sticky clay to form a mud pot. Hydrogen sulfide gas is present deep in the earth at Mud Volcano and is oxidized to sulfuric acid by microbial activity, which dissolves the surface soils to create pools and cones of clay and mud. Along with hydrogen sulfide, steam, carbon dioxide, and other gases explode through the layers of mud.

A series of shallow earthquakes associated with the volcanic activity in Yellowstone struck this area in 1978. Soil temperatures increased to nearly 200 °F (93 °C). The slope between Sizzling Basin and Mud Geyser, once covered with green grass and trees, became a barren landscape of fallen trees known as &quot;the cooking hillside&quot;.

<text>Mammoth Hot Springs is a large complex of hot springs on a hill of travertine in Yellowstone National Park adjacent to Fort Yellowstone and the Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District. It was created over thousands of years as hot water from the spring cooled and deposited calcium carbonate (over two tons flow into Mammoth each day in a solution). Because of the huge amount of geothermal vents, travertine flourishes. Although these springs lie outside the caldera boundary, their energy has been attributed to the same magmatic system that fuels other Yellowstone geothermal areas.

The hot water that feeds Mammoth comes from Norris Geyser Basin after traveling underground via a fault line that runs through limestone and roughly parallel to the Norris-to-Mammoth road. The limestone from rock formations along the fault is the source of the calcium carbonate. Shallow circulation along this corridor allows Norris&#x27;s superheated water to slightly cool before surfacing at Mammoth, generally at about . Algae living in the warm pools have tinted the travertine shades of brown, orange, red, and green.

Thermal activity here is extensive both over time and distance. The thermal flows show much variability with some variations taking place over periods ranging from decades to days. Terrace Mountain at Mammoth Hot Springs is the largest known carbonate-depositing spring in the world. The most famous feature at the springs is the Minerva Terrace, a series of travertine terraces. The terraces have been deposited by the spring over many years but, due to recent minor earthquake activity, the spring vent has shifted, rendering the terraces dry.

The Mammoth Terraces extend all the way from the hillside, across the Parade Ground, and down to Boiling River. The Mammoth Hotel, as well as all of Fort Yellowstone, is built upon an old terrace formation known as Hotel Terrace. There was some concern when construction began in 1891 on the fort site that the hollow ground would not support the weight of the buildings. Several large sink holes (fenced off) can be seen out on the Parade Ground. This area has been thermally active for several thousand years.

The Mammoth area exhibits much evidence of glacial activity from the Pinedale Glaciation. The summit of Terrace Mountain is covered with glacial till, thereby dating the travertine formation there to earlier than the end of the Pinedale Glaciation. Several thermal kames, including Capitol Hill and Dude Hill, are major features of the Mammoth Village area. Ice-marginal stream beds are in evidence in the small, narrow valleys where Floating Island Lake and Phantom Lake are found. In Gardner Canyon one can see the old, sorted gravel bed of the Gardner River covered by unsorted glacial till.

<doc id="245180" wikidata="Q748846" url="?curid=245180" title="Dilmun">
<text>Dilmun, or Telmun, (Sumerian: , later 𒉌𒌇(𒆠), NI.TUKki = dilmunki; ) was an ancient East Semitic-speaking civilization in Eastern Arabia mentioned from the 3rd millennium BC onwards. Based on contextual evidence, it was located in the Persian Gulf, on a trade route between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley civilisation, close to the sea and to artesian springs. Dilmun encompassed Bahrain, Kuwait, and eastern Saudi Arabia.

The great commercial and trading connections between Mesopotamia and Dilmun were strong and profound to the point where Dilmun was a central figure to the Sumerian creation myth. Dilmun was described in the saga of Enki and Ninhursag as pre-existing in paradisiacal state, where predators do not kill, pain and diseases are absent, and people do not get old.

Dilmun was an important trading centre. At the height of its power, it controlled the Persian Gulf trading routes. According to some modern theories, the Sumerians regarded Dilmun as a sacred place, but that is never stated in any known ancient text. Dilmun was mentioned by the Mesopotamians as a trade partner, a source of copper, and a trade entrepôt.

The Sumerian tale of the garden paradise of Dilmun may have been an inspiration for the Garden of Eden story.

==History==
Dilmun was an important trading center from the late fourth millennium BC to 800 BC. At the height of its power, Dilmun controlled the Persian Gulf trading routes. It was very prosperous during the first 300 years of the second millennium BC. Conquered by the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365–1050 BC), its commercial power began to decline between 1000 BC and 800 BC because piracy flourished in the Persian Gulf. In the 8th and 7th centuries BC the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–605 BC) conquered Dilmun, and in the 6th century BC the Neo-Babylonian Empire, and later the Achaemenid Empire, ruled.

The Dilmun civilization was the centre of commercial activities linking traditional agriculture of the land—then utterly fertile due to artesian wells that have since dried, and due to a much wetter climate—with maritime trade between diverse regions such as the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia in its early stage and later between China and the Mediterranean. The Dilmun civilization is mentioned first in Sumerian cuneiform clay tablets dated to the late third millennium BC, found in the temple of the goddess Inanna, in the city of Uruk. The adjective Dilmun is used to describe a type of axe and one specific official; in addition there are lists of rations of wool issued to people connected with Dilmun.

One of the earliest inscriptions mentioning Dilmun is that of king Ur-Nanshe of Lagash () found in a door-socket: &quot;The ships of Dilmun brought him wood as tribute from foreign lands.&quot;

=== Kingdom of Dilmun ===

From around 2050 BC onward, Dilmun seems to have been at its peak. Qal&#x27;at al-Bahrain was most likely the capital of Dilmun. From texts found at Isin, it is believed Dilmun became an independent kingdom, free from Mesopotamian rule; royal gifts to Dilmun are mentioned. Contacts with the Amorite state of Mari, in the northern Levant, are attested. Around this time, the largest royal burial mounds were erected. From about 1780 BC came several Akkadian-language inscriptions on stone vessels naming two kings of Dilmun, King Yagli-El (and Amoritic name) and his father, Rimum. The inscriptions were found in huge tumuli, evidently the burial places of these kings. Rimum was already known to archaeology from the Durand Stone, discovered in 1879.

A decline is visible from around 1720 BC. Many settlements were no longer used, and the building of royal mounds ceased. The Barbar Temple fell into ruins. A &#x27;recovering&#x27; period is noted from around 1650 BC. New royal burial mounds were built; at Qal&#x27;at al-Bahrain, there is evidence for increased building activity. A seal from this period found at Failaka preserved a king&#x27;s name. The short text reads, &quot;[La]&#x27;ù-la Panipa, daughter of Sumu-lěl, the servant of Inzak of Akarum&quot;. Sumu-lěl was evidently a third king of Dilmun from around this period. &quot;Servant of Inzak of Akarum&quot; was the king&#x27;s title in Dilmun. The names of these later rulers are Amoritic.

=== Dilmun under foreign rule ===

It seems that from at least 1500 BC, Dilmun was under the rule of the Akkadian-speaking Mesopotamian Sealand dynasty. The Sealand dynasty King Ea-gamil is mentioned in a text found at Qal&#x27;at al-Bahrain. Ea-gamil was the last ruler of the Sealand dynasty. After his reign, Dilmun came under the rule of the Babylonian Kassite dynasty, as they took over the land of the Sealand dynasty. Dilmun was mentioned in two letters dated to the reign of Burna-Buriash II (), recovered from Nippur during the Kassite dynasty of Babylon. These letters were from a provincial official named Ilī-ippašra, in Dilmun, to his friend, Enlil-kidinni, the governor of Nippur. The names referred to are Akkadian. These letters, and other documents, suggest an administrative relationship between Dilmun and Babylon at that time. Following the collapse of the Kassite dynasty, in 1595 BC, Mesopotamian documents make no mention of Dilmun until Assyrian inscriptions (dated from 1250 BC to 1050 BC) proclaimed Assyrian kings to be rulers of Dilmun and Meluhha, as well as Lower Sea and Upper Sea. Assyrian inscriptions recorded tribute from Dilmun.

There are other Assyrian inscriptions during the first millennium BC, indicating Assyrian sovereignty over Dilmun. One of the early sites discovered in Bahrain suggests that Sennacherib, King of Assyria (707–681 BC), attacked northeast Arabia and captured the Bahraini islands. The most recent reference to Dilmun came during the Neo-Babylonian Empire; Neo-Babylonian administrative records, dated 567 BC, stated that Dilmun was controlled by the King of Babylon. The name of Dilmun fell from use after the collapse of Babylon, in 538 BC, with the area henceforth identified as Tylos during the Hellenistic period.

The &quot;Persian Gulf&quot; types of circular, stamped (rather than rolled) seals known from Dilmun—that appear at Lothal, Gujarat, India, and Failaka (as well as in Mesopotamia)—are evidence of long-distance sea trade. What the commerce consisted of is less known; timber and precious woods, ivory, lapis lazuli, gold, and luxury goods (such as carnelian and glazed stone beads), pearls from the Persian Gulf, shell and bone inlays were among the goods sent to Mesopotamia, in-exchange for silver, tin, woolen textiles, olive oil and grains.

Copper ingots from Oman and bitumen (which occurred naturally in Mesopotamia) may have been exchanged for cotton textiles and domestic fowl, major products of the Indus region that are not native to Mesopotamia. Instances of all of these trade goods have been found. The importance of this trade is shown by the fact that the weights and measures used at Dilmun were, identical to those used by the Indus, and were not those used in Southern Mesopotamia.

In regards to copper mining and smelting, the Umm al-Nar culture and Dalma (United Arab Emirates) and Ibri (Oman) were particularly important.

Some Meluhhan vessels may have sailed directly to Mesopotamian ports but, by the Isin-Larsa Period, Dilmun monopolized the trade. The Bahrain National Museum assesses that its &quot;Golden Age&quot; lasted . Discoveries of ruins under the Persian Gulf may be of Dilmun.

==People and language==
The population used cuneiform to write in the Akkadian language, and, like the Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians and Eblaites of Mesopotamia, are thought to have spoken an East Semitic language that was either an Akkadian dialect or one close to it, rather than a Central Semitic language, and most of its known rulers had East Semitic names. Dilmun&#x27;s main deity was named Inzak and his spouse was Panipa. However, there is no indication of population replacement having happened in the region.

==Mythology==

In the early epic &quot;Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta&quot;, the main events, which center on Enmerkar&#x27;s construction of the ziggurats in Uruk and Eridu, are described as taking place at a time &quot;before Dilmun had yet been settled&quot;.

Dilmun, sometimes described as &quot;the place where the sun rises&quot; and &quot;the Land of the Living&quot;, is the scene of some versions of the Eridu Genesis, and the place where the deified Sumerian hero of the flood, Utnapishtim (Ziusudra), was taken by the gods to live forever. Thorkild Jacobsen&#x27;s translation of the Eridu Genesis calls it &quot;Mount Dilmun&quot; which he locates as a &quot;faraway, half-mythical place&quot;.

Dilmun is also described in the epic story of Enki and Ninhursag as the site at which the Creation occurred. The later Babylonian &quot;Enuma Elish&quot;, speaks of the creation site as the place where the mixture of salt water, personified as Tiamat met and mingled with the fresh water of Abzu. Bahrain in Arabic means &quot;the twin waters&quot;, where the fresh water of the Arabian aquifer mingles with the salt waters of the Persian Gulf. The promise of Enki to Ninhursag, the Earth Mother:
For Dilmun, the land of my lady&#x27;s heart, I will create long waterways, rivers and canals, whereby water will flow to quench the thirst of all beings and bring abundance to all that lives.
Ninlil, the Sumerian goddess of air and south wind had her home in Dilmun.

However, it is also speculated that Gilgamesh had to pass through Mount Mashu to reach Dilmun in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, which is usually identified with the whole of the parallel Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges, with the narrow gap between these mountains constituting the tunnel.

==Location of Dilmun==
In 1987, Theresa Howard-Carter proposed that Dilmun of this era might be a still unidentified tell near the Arvand Rud (Shatt al-Arab in Arabic) between modern-day Quanah and Basra in modern-day Iraq. In favor of Howard-Carter&#x27;s proposal, it has been noted that this area does lie to the east of Sumer (&quot;where the sun rises&quot;), and the riverbank where Dilmun&#x27;s maidens would have been accosted aligns with the Shat al-Arab which is in the midst of marshes. The &quot;mouth of the rivers&quot; where Dilmun was said to lie is for her the union of the Tigris and Euphrates at Qurnah. A number of scholars have suggested that Dilmun originally designated the eastern province of modern Saudi Arabia, notably linked with the major Dilmunite settlements of Umm an-Nussi and Umm ar-Ramadh in the interior and Tarout on the coast.

===Garden of Eden theory===
In 1922, Eduard Glaser proposed that the Garden of Eden was located in Eastern Arabia within the Dilmun civilization. Scholar Juris Zarins also believes that the Garden of Eden was situated in Dilmun at the head of the Persian Gulf (present-day Kuwait), where the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers run into the sea, from his research on this area using information from many different sources, including Landsat images from space. In this theory, the Bible&#x27;s Gihon would correspond with the Karun in Iran, and the Pishon River would correspond to the Wadi al-Batin river system that once drained the now dry, but once quite fertile central part of the Arabian Peninsula.

==Known rulers==
Only a few rulers of the Dilmun kingdom are known:
# Ziusudra (27th century BC)
# Rimun ()
# Yagli-El, son of Rimun 
# Sumu-lěl ()
# Usiananuri, grandfather of Uballissu-Marduk (precise dates unknown)
# Ilī-ippašra (contemporary with Burnaburiash II and Kurigalzu II)
# Operi ()
# Hundaru I ()
# Qena ()
# Hundaru II (706–685 BC)
