<text>Emanuel Lasker (; December 24, 1868 – January 11, 1941) was a German chess player, mathematician, and philosopher. He was the second World Chess Champion, holding the title for 27 years, from 1894 to 1921, the longest reign of any officially recognised World Chess Champion winning 6 World Chess Championships. In his prime, Lasker was one of the most dominant champions, and he is still generally regarded as one of the strongest players in history.

His contemporaries used to say that Lasker used a &quot;psychological&quot; approach to the game, and even that he sometimes deliberately played inferior moves to confuse opponents. Recent analysis, however, indicates that he was ahead of his time and used a more flexible approach than his contemporaries, which mystified many of them. Lasker knew contemporary analyses of openings well but disagreed with many of them. He published chess magazines and five chess books, but later players and commentators found it difficult to draw lessons from his methods.

Lasker made contributions to the development of other games. He was a first-class contract bridge player and wrote about bridge, Go, and his own invention, Lasca. His books about games presented a problem that is still considered notable in the mathematical analysis of card games. Lasker was a research mathematician who was known for his contributions to commutative algebra, which included proving the primary decomposition of the ideals of polynomial rings. His philosophical works and a drama that he co-wrote, however, received little attention.

== Life and career ==
=== Early years 1868–1894 ===

Emanuel Lasker was born on December 24, 1868, at Berlinchen in Neumark (now Barlinek in Poland), the son of a Jewish cantor. At the age of eleven he was sent to study mathematics in Berlin, where he lived with his brother Berthold, eight years his senior, who taught him how to play chess. Berthold was among the world&#x27;s top ten players in the early 1890s. To supplement their income, Emanuel Lasker played chess and card games for small stakes, especially at the Café Kaiserhof.

Lasker won the Café Kaiserhof&#x27;s annual Winter tournament 1888/89 and the &quot;Hauptturnier A&quot; (&quot;second division&quot; tournament) at the sixth DSB Congress (German Chess Federation&#x27;s congress), held in Breslau. Winning the Hauptturnier earned Lasker the title of &quot;master&quot;. The candidates were divided into two groups of ten. The top four in each group competed in a final. Lasker won his section, with 2½ points more than his nearest rival. However, scores were reset to 0 for the final. With two rounds to go, Lasker trailed the leader, Viennese amateur von Feierfeil, by 1½ points. Lasker won both of his final games, while von Feierfeil lost in the penultimate round (being mated in 121 moves after the position was reconstructed incorrectly following an adjournment) and drew in the last round. The two players were now tied. Lasker won a playoff and garnered the master title. This enabled him to play in master-level tournaments and thus launched his chess career.

Lasker finished second in an international tournament at Amsterdam, ahead of Mason and Gunsberg. In spring 1892, he won two tournaments in London, the second and stronger of these without losing a game. At New York City in 1893, he won all thirteen games, one of the few times in chess history that a player has achieved a perfect score in a significant tournament.
His record in matches was equally impressive: At Berlin in 1890 he drew a short playoff match against his brother Berthold and won all his other matches from 1889 to 1893, mostly against top-class opponents: Curt von Bardeleben (1889), Jacques Mieses (1889), Henry Edward Bird (1890), Berthold Englisch (1890), Joseph Henry Blackburne (1892), Jackson Showalter (1892–93) and Celso Golmayo Zúpide (1893). 

In 1892 Lasker founded the first of his chess magazines, &quot;The London Chess Fortnightly&quot;, which was published from August 15, 1892, to July 30, 1893. In the second quarter of 1893, there was a gap of ten weeks between issues, allegedly because of problems with the printer. Shortly after its last issue, Lasker traveled to the US, where he spent the next two years.

Lasker challenged Siegbert Tarrasch, who had won three consecutive strong international tournaments (Breslau 1889, Manchester 1890, and Dresden 1892), to a match. Tarrasch haughtily declined, stating that Lasker should first prove his mettle by attempting to win one or two major international events.

=== Chess competition 1894–1918 ===
==== Matches against Steinitz ====

Rebuffed by Tarrasch, Lasker challenged the reigning World Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, to a match for the title. Initially Lasker wanted to play for US$5,000 a side, and a match was agreed to at stakes of $3,000 a side, but Steinitz agreed to a series of reductions when Lasker found it difficult to raise the money. The final figure was $2,000, which was less than for some of Steinitz&#x27;s earlier matches (the final combined stake of $4,000 would be worth over $495,000 at 2006 values). The match was played in 1894 at venues in New York, Philadelphia, and Montreal. Steinitz had previously declared he would win without doubt, so it came as a shock when Lasker won the first game. Steinitz won the second game and maintained the balance through the sixth. However, Lasker won all the games from the seventh to the eleventh, and Steinitz asked for a week&#x27;s rest. When the match resumed, Steinitz looked in better shape and won the 13th and 14th games. Lasker struck back in the 15th and 16th, and Steinitz did not compensate for his losses in the middle of the match. Hence Lasker won convincingly with ten wins, five losses, and four draws. On May 26, Lasker thus became the second formally recognized World Chess Champion and confirmed his title by beating Steinitz even more convincingly in their rematch in 1896–97 (ten wins, two losses, and five draws).

==== Tournament successes ====

Influential players and journalists belittled the 1894 match both before and after it took place. Lasker&#x27;s difficulty in getting backing may have been caused by hostile pre-match comments from Gunsberg and Leopold Hoffer, who had long been a bitter enemy of Steinitz. One of the complaints was that Lasker had never played the other two members of the top four, Siegbert Tarrasch and Mikhail Chigorin – although Tarrasch had rejected a challenge from Lasker in 1892, publicly telling him to go and win an international tournament first. After the match some commentators, notably Tarrasch, said Lasker had won mainly because Steinitz was old (58 in 1894).

Emanuel Lasker answered these criticisms by creating an even more impressive playing record. He came third at Hastings 1895 (where he may have been suffering from the after-effects of typhoid fever), behind Pillsbury and Chigorin but ahead of Tarrasch and Steinitz, and then won first prizes at very strong tournaments in St Petersburg 1895–96 (an elite, 4-player tournament, ahead of Steinitz, Pillsbury and Chigorin), Nuremberg (1896), London (1899) and Paris (1900); tied for second at Cambridge Springs 1904, and tied for first at the Chigorin Memorial in St Petersburg 1909.

Later, at St Petersburg (1914), he overcame a 1½-point deficit to finish ahead of the rising stars, Capablanca and Alexander Alekhine, who later became the next two World Champions. For decades chess writers have reported that Tsar Nicholas II of Russia conferred the title of Grandmaster of Chess upon each of the five finalists at St Petersburg 1914 (Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Tarrasch and Marshall), but chess historian Edward Winter has questioned this, stating that the earliest known sources supporting this story were published in 1940 and 1942.

==== Matches against Marshall and Tarrasch ====

Lasker&#x27;s match record was as impressive between his 1896–97 rematch with Steinitz and 1914: he won all but one of his normal matches, and three of those were convincing defenses of his title. 

In 1906 Lasker and Géza Maróczy agreed to terms for a World Championship, but the arrangements could not be finalised, and the match never took place.

Lasker&#x27;s first world championship match since 1897 was against Frank Marshall in the World Chess Championship 1907. Despite his aggressive style, Marshall could not win a single game, losing eight and drawing seven (final score: 11½–3½).

Lasker then played Tarrasch in the World Chess Championship 1908, first at Düsseldorf then at Munich. Tarrasch firmly believed the game of chess was governed by a precise set of principles. For him the strength of a chess move was in its logic, not in its efficiency. Because of his stubborn principles he considered Lasker as a who won his games only thanks to dubious tricks, while Lasker mocked the arrogance of Tarrasch who, in his opinion, shone more in salons than at the chessboard. At the opening ceremony, Tarrasch refused to talk to Lasker, only saying: &quot;Mr. Lasker, I have only three words to say to you: check and mate!&quot;

Lasker gave a brilliant answer on the chessboard, winning four of the first five games, and playing a type of chess Tarrasch could not understand. For example, in the second game after 19 moves arose a situation () in which Lasker was a pawn down, with a and . At this point it appeared Tarrasch was winning, but 20 moves later he was forced to resign. Lasker eventually won by 10½–5½ (eight wins, five draws, and three losses). Tarrasch claimed the wet weather was the cause of his defeat.

==== Matches against Janowski ====
In 1909 Lasker drew a short match (two wins, two losses) against Dawid Janowski, an all-out attacking Polish expatriate. Several months later they played a longer match in Paris, and chess historians still debate whether this was for the World Chess Championship. Understanding Janowski&#x27;s style, Lasker chose to defend solidly so that Janowski unleashed his attacks too soon and left himself vulnerable. Lasker easily won the match 8–2 (seven wins, two draws, one loss). This victory was convincing for everyone but Janowski, who asked for a revenge match. Lasker accepted and they played a World Chess Championship match in Berlin in November–December 1910. Lasker crushed his opponent, winning 9½–1½ (eight wins, three draws, no losses). Janowski did not understand Lasker&#x27;s moves, and after his first three losses he declared to Edward Lasker, &quot;Your homonym plays so stupidly that I cannot even look at the chessboard when he thinks. I am afraid I will not do anything good in this match.&quot;

==== Match against Schlechter ====
Between his two matches against Janowski, Lasker arranged another World Chess Championship in January–February 1910 against Carl Schlechter. Schlechter was a modest gentleman, who was generally unlikely to win the major chess tournaments by his peaceful inclination, his lack of aggressiveness and his willingness to accept most draw offers from his opponents (about 80% of his games finished by a draw). 

At the beginning, Lasker tried to attack but Schlechter had no difficulty defending, so that the first four games finished in draws. In the fifth game Lasker had a big advantage, but committed a blunder that cost him the game. Hence at the middle of the match Schlechter was one point ahead. The next four games were drawn, despite fierce play from both players. In the sixth Schlechter managed to draw a game being a pawn down. In the seventh Lasker nearly lost because of a beautiful exchange sacrifice from Schlechter. In the ninth only a blunder from Lasker allowed Schlechter to draw a lost ending. The score before the last game was thus 5–4 for Schlechter. In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win tactically and took a big advantage, but he missed a clear win at the 35th move, continued to take increasing risks and finished by losing. Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion.

It has been speculated that Schlechter played unusually risky chess in the tenth game because the terms of the match required him to win by a margin of two games. But according to Isaak and Vladimir Linder, this was unlikely. The match was originally to be a 30-game affair and Schlechter would have to win by two games. But they note that according to the Austrian chess historian Michael Ehn, Lasker agreed to forgo the plus two provision in view of the match being subsequently reduced to only 10 games. For proof Ehn quoted Schlechter&#x27;s comment printed in Allgemeine Sportzeitung (ASZ) of December 9, 1909 &quot;There will be ten games in all. The winner on points will receive the title of world champion. If the points are equal, the decision will be made by the arbiter.&quot;
==== Abandoned challenges ====
In 1911 Lasker received a challenge for a world title match against the rising star José Raúl Capablanca. Lasker was unwilling to play the traditional &quot;first to win ten games&quot; type of match in the semi-tropical conditions of Havana, especially as drawn games were becoming more frequent and the match might last for over six months. He therefore made a counter-proposal: if neither player had a lead of at least two games by the end of the match, it should be considered a draw; the match should be limited to the best of thirty games, counting draws; except that if either player won six games &quot;and&quot; led by at least two games before thirty games were completed, he should be declared the winner; the champion should decide the venue and stakes, and should have the exclusive right to publish the games; the challenger should deposit a forfeit of US$2,000 (equivalent to over $250,000 in 2020 values); the time limit should be twelve moves per hour; play should be limited to two sessions of 2½ hours each per day, five days a week. Capablanca objected to the time limit, the short playing times, the thirty-game limit, and especially the requirement that he must win by two games to claim the title, which he regarded as unfair. Lasker took offence at the terms in which Capablanca criticized the two-game lead condition and broke off negotiations, and until 1914 Lasker and Capablanca were not on speaking terms. However, at the 1914 St. Petersburg tournament, Capablanca proposed a set of rules for the conduct of World Championship matches, which were accepted by all the leading players, including Lasker.

Late in 1912 Lasker entered into negotiations for a world title match with Akiba Rubinstein, whose tournament record for the previous few years had been on a par with Lasker&#x27;s and a little ahead of Capablanca&#x27;s. The two players agreed to play a match if Rubinstein could raise the funds, but Rubinstein had few rich friends to back him and the match was never played. This situation demonstrated some of the flaws inherent in the championship system then being used. The start of World War I in summer 1914 put an end to hopes that Lasker would play either Rubinstein or Capablanca for the World Championship in the near future.
Throughout World War I (1914–1918) Lasker played in only two serious chess events. He convincingly won (5½−½) a non-title match against Tarrasch in 1916. In September–October 1918, shortly before the armistice, he won a quadrangular (four-player) tournament, half a point ahead of Rubinstein.

=== Academic activities 1894–1918 ===

Despite his superb playing results, chess was not Lasker&#x27;s only interest. His parents recognized his intellectual talents, especially for mathematics, and sent the adolescent Emanuel to study in Berlin (where he found he also had a talent for chess). Lasker gained his abitur (high school graduation certificate) at Landsberg an der Warthe, now a Polish town named Gorzów Wielkopolski but then part of Prussia. He then studied mathematics and philosophy at the universities in Berlin, Göttingen (where David Hilbert was one of his doctoral advisors) and Heidelberg.

In 1895 he published two mathematical articles in &quot;Nature&quot;. On the advice of David Hilbert he registered for doctoral studies at Erlangen during 1900–1902. In 1901 he presented his doctoral thesis &quot;Über Reihen auf der Convergenzgrenze&quot; (&quot;On Series at Convergence Boundaries&quot;) at Erlangen and in the same year it was published by the Royal Society. He was awarded a doctorate in mathematics in 1902. His most significant mathematical article, in 1905, published a theorem on primary decompositions of which Emmy Noether developed a more generalized form, which is now regarded as of fundamental importance to modern algebra and algebraic geometry.

Lasker held short-term positions as a mathematics lecturer at Tulane University in New Orleans (1893) and Victoria University in Manchester (1901; Victoria University was one of the &quot;parents&quot; of the current University of Manchester). However, he was unable to secure a longer-term position, and pursued his scholarly interests independently.

In 1906 Lasker published a booklet titled &quot;Kampf&quot; (&quot;Struggle&quot;), in which he attempted to create a general theory of all competitive activities, including chess, business and war. He produced two other books which are generally categorized as philosophy, &quot;Das Begreifen der Welt&quot; (&quot;Comprehending the World&quot;; 1913) and &quot;Die Philosophie des Unvollendbar&quot; (sic; &quot;The Philosophy of the Unattainable&quot;; 1918).

=== Other activities 1894–1918 ===
In 1896–97 Lasker published his book &quot;Common Sense in Chess&quot;, based on lectures he had given in London in 1895.


In 1903, Lasker played in Ostend against Mikhail Chigorin, a six-game match that was sponsored by the wealthy lawyer and industrialist Isaac Rice in order to test the Rice Gambit. Lasker narrowly lost the match. Three years later Lasker became secretary of the Rice Gambit Association, founded by Rice in order to promote the Rice Gambit, and in 1907 Lasker quoted with approval Rice&#x27;s views on the convergence of chess and military strategy.

In November 1904, Lasker founded &quot;Lasker&#x27;s Chess Magazine&quot;, which ran until 1909.

Beginning in 1910, he wrote a weekly chess column for the New York Evening Post, for which he was Chess Editor.

Emanuel Lasker became interested in the strategy game Go after being introduced to it by his namesake Edward Lasker, probably in 1907 or 1908 (Edward Lasker wrote a successful book &quot;Go and Go-Moku&quot; in 1934). He and Edward played Go together while Edward was helping him prepare for his 1908 match with Tarrasch. He kept his interest in Go for the rest of his life, becoming one of the strongest players in Germany and Europe and contributing occasionally to the magazine &quot;Deutsche Go-Zeitung&quot;. It is alleged that he once said &quot;Had I discovered Go sooner, I would probably have never become world chess champion&quot;.

At the age of 42, in July 1911, Lasker married Martha Cohn (née Bamberger), a rich widow who was a year older than Lasker and already a grandmother. They lived in Berlin. Martha Cohn wrote popular stories under the pseudonym &quot;L. Marco&quot;.

During World War I, Lasker invested all of his savings in German war bonds, which lost nearly their entire value with the wartime and post-war inflation. During the war, he wrote a pamphlet which claimed that civilization would be in danger if Germany lost the war.

=== Match against Capablanca ===

In January 1920 Lasker and José Raúl Capablanca signed an agreement to play a World Championship match in 1921, noting that Capablanca was not free to play in 1920. Because of the delay, Lasker insisted on a final clause that allowed him to play anyone else for the championship in 1920, that nullified the contract with Capablanca if Lasker lost a title match in 1920, and that stipulated that if Lasker resigned the title Capablanca should become World Champion. Lasker had previously included in his agreement before World War I to play Akiba Rubinstein for the title a similar clause that if he resigned the title, it should become Rubinstein&#x27;s.

A report in the &quot;American Chess Bulletin&quot; (July–August 1920 issue) said that Lasker had resigned the world title in favor of Capablanca because the conditions of the match were unpopular in the chess world. The &quot;American Chess Bulletin&quot; speculated that the conditions were not sufficiently unpopular to warrant resignation of the title, and that Lasker&#x27;s real concern was that there was not enough financial backing to justify his devoting nine months to the match. When Lasker resigned the title in favor of Capablanca he was unaware that enthusiasts in Havana had just raised $20,000 to fund the match provided it was played there. When Capablanca learned of Lasker&#x27;s resignation he went to the Netherlands, where Lasker was living at the time, to inform him that Havana would finance the match. In August 1920 Lasker agreed to play in Havana, but insisted that he was the challenger as Capablanca was now the champion. Capablanca signed an agreement that accepted this point, and soon afterwards published a letter confirming this. Lasker also stated that, if he beat Capablanca, he would resign the title so that younger masters could compete for it.

The match was played in March–April 1921. After four draws, the fifth game saw Lasker blunder with Black in an equal ending. Capablanca&#x27;s solid style allowed him to easily draw the next four games, without taking any risks. In the tenth game, Lasker as White played a position with an Isolated Queen Pawn but failed to create the necessary activity and Capablanca reached a superior ending, which he duly won. The eleventh and fourteenth games were also won by Capablanca, and Lasker resigned the match.

Reuben Fine and Harry Golombek attributed this to Lasker&#x27;s being in mysteriously poor form. On the other hand, Vladimir Kramnik thought that Lasker played quite well and the match was an &quot;even and fascinating fight&quot; until Lasker blundered in the last game, and explained that Capablanca was 20 years younger, a slightly stronger player, and had more recent competitive practice.

=== European life and travels ===
Lasker was in his early 50s when he lost the world championship to Capablanca, and he retired from serious match play afterwards; his only other match was a short exhibition against Frank James Marshall in 1940, which was never completed due to Lasker&#x27;s illness and subsequent death a few months after it started. After winning the Moravská Ostrava 1923 chess tournament (without a single loss) and the New York 1924 chess tournament (1½ points ahead of Capablanca) and finishing second at Moscow in 1925 (1½ points behind Efim Bogoljubow, ½ point ahead of Capablanca), he effectively retired from serious chess.
During the Moscow 1925 chess tournament, Lasker received a telegram informing him that the drama written by himself and his brother Berthold, &quot;&quot; (&quot;History of Mankind&quot;), had been accepted for performance at the Lessing theatre in Berlin. Lasker was so distracted by this news that he lost badly to Carlos Torre the same day. The play, however, was not a success.

In 1926, Lasker wrote &quot;Lehrbuch des Schachspiels&quot;, which he re-wrote in English in 1927 as &quot;Lasker&#x27;s Manual of Chess&quot;. He also wrote books on other games of mental skill: &quot;Encyclopedia of Games&quot; (1929) and &quot;Das verständige Kartenspiel&quot; (means &quot;Sensible Card Play&quot;; 1929; English translation in the same year), both of which posed a problem in the mathematical analysis of card games; &quot;Brettspiele der Völker&quot; (&quot;Board Games of the Nations&quot;; 1931), which includes 30 pages about Go and a section about a game he had invented in 1911, Lasca.

In 1930, Lasker was a special correspondent for Dutch and German newspapers reporting on the Culbertson-Buller bridge match during which he became a registered teacher of the Culbertson system. He became an expert bridge player, representing Germany at international events in the early 1930s, and wrote &quot;Das Bridgespiel&quot; (&quot;The Game of Bridge&quot;) in 1931.

In October 1928 Emanuel Lasker&#x27;s brother Berthold died.

In spring 1933 Adolf Hitler started a campaign of discrimination and intimidation against Jews, depriving them of their property and citizenship. Lasker and his wife Martha, who were both Jewish, were forced to leave Germany in the same year. After a short stay in England, in 1935 they were invited to live in the USSR by Nikolai Krylenko, the Commissar of Justice who had been responsible for show trials and, in his other capacity as Sports Minister, was an enthusiastic supporter of chess. In the USSR, Lasker renounced his German citizenship and received Soviet citizenship. He took permanent residence in Moscow, and was given a post at Moscow&#x27;s Institute for Mathematics and a post of trainer of the USSR national team.
Lasker returned to competitive chess to make some money, finishing fifth in Zürich 1934 and third in Moscow 1935 (undefeated, ½ point behind Mikhail Botvinnik and Salo Flohr; ahead of Capablanca, Rudolf Spielmann and several Soviet masters), sixth in Moscow 1936 and equal seventh in Nottingham 1936. His performance in Moscow 1935 at age 66 was hailed as &quot;a biological miracle&quot;.

===Settling in the United States===
In August 1937, Martha and Emanuel Lasker decided to leave the Soviet Union, and they moved, via the Netherlands, to the United States (first Chicago, next New York) in October 1937. They were visiting Martha&#x27;s daughter, but they may also have been motivated by political upheaval in the Soviet Union. In the United States Lasker tried to support himself by giving chess and bridge lectures and exhibitions, as he was now too old for serious competition. In 1940 he published his last book, &quot;The Community of the Future&quot;, in which he proposed solutions for serious political problems, including anti-Semitism and unemployment.

== Assessment ==
=== Playing strength and style ===
Lasker was considered to have a &quot;psychological&quot; method of play in which he considered the subjective qualities of his opponent, in addition to the objective requirements of his position on the board. Richard Réti published a lengthy analysis of Lasker&#x27;s play in which he concluded that Lasker deliberately played inferior moves that he knew would make his opponent uncomfortable. W. H. K. Pollock commented, &quot;It is no easy matter to reply correctly to Lasker&#x27;s bad moves.&quot;

Lasker himself denied the claim that he deliberately played bad moves, and most modern writers agree. According to Grandmaster Andrew Soltis and International Master John L. Watson, the features that made his play mysterious to contemporaries now appear regularly in modern play: sacrifices to gain positional advantage; playing the &quot;practical&quot; move rather than trying to find the best move; counterattacking and complicating the game before a disadvantage became serious. Former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik said, &quot;He realized that different types of advantage could be interchangeable: tactical edge could be converted into strategic advantage and vice versa&quot;, which mystified contemporaries who were just becoming used to the theories of Steinitz as codified by Siegbert Tarrasch.

Max Euwe opined that the real reason behind Lasker&#x27;s success was his &quot;exceptional defensive technique&quot; and that &quot;almost all there is to say about defensive chess can be demonstrated by examples from the games of Steinitz and Lasker&quot;, the former exemplifying passive defence and the latter an active defence.

The famous win against José Raúl Capablanca at St. Petersburg in 1914, which Lasker needed in order to retain any chance of catching up with Capablanca, is sometimes offered as evidence of his &quot;psychological&quot; approach. Reuben Fine describes Lasker&#x27;s choice of opening, the Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez, as &quot;innocuous but psychologically potent&quot;. Luděk Pachman writes that Lasker&#x27;s choice presented his opponent with a dilemma: with only a ½ point lead, Capablanca would have wanted to play safe; but the Exchange Variation&#x27;s pawn structure gives White an endgame advantage, and Black must use his aggressively in the middlegame to nullify this. However, an analysis of Lasker&#x27;s use of this variation throughout his career concludes that he had excellent results with it as White against top-class opponents, and sometimes used it in &quot;must-win&quot; situations. In Kramnik&#x27;s opinion, Lasker&#x27;s play in this game demonstrated deep positional understanding, rather than psychology.

Fine reckoned Lasker paid little attention to the openings, but Capablanca thought Lasker knew the openings very well but disagreed with a lot of contemporary opening analysis. In fact before the 1894 world title match, Lasker studied the openings thoroughly, especially Steinitz&#x27;s favorite lines. He played primarily e4 openings, particularly the Ruy Lopez. He opened with 1.d4 relatively rarely, although his d4 games had a higher winning percentage than his e4 ones. With the Black pieces, he mainly answered 1.e4 with the French Defense and 1.d4 with the Queen&#x27;s Gambit. Lasker also used the Sicilian Defense fairly often. In Capablanca&#x27;s opinion, no player surpassed Lasker in the ability to assess a position quickly and accurately, in terms of who had the better prospects of winning and what strategy each side should adopt. Capablanca also wrote that Lasker was so adaptable that he played in no definite style, and that he was both a tenacious defender and a very efficient finisher of his own attacks.

Lasker followed Steinitz&#x27;s principles, and both demonstrated a completely different chess paradigm than the &quot;romantic&quot; mentality before them. Thanks to Steinitz and Lasker, positional players gradually became common (Tarrasch, Schlechter, and Rubinstein stand out.) But, while Steinitz created a new school of chess thought, Lasker&#x27;s talents were far harder for the masses to grasp; hence there was no Lasker school.

In addition to his enormous chess skill, Lasker was said to have an excellent competitive temperament: his rival Siegbert Tarrasch once said, &quot;Lasker occasionally loses a game, but he never loses his head.&quot; Lasker enjoyed the need to adapt to varying styles and to the shifting fortunes of tournaments. Although very strong in matches, he was even stronger in tournaments. For over 20 years, he always finished ahead of the younger Capablanca: at St. Petersburg 1914, New York 1924, Moscow 1925, and Moscow 1935. Only in 1936 (15 years after their match), when Lasker was 67, did Capablanca finish ahead of him.

In 1964, &quot;Chessworld&quot; magazine published an article in which future World Champion Bobby Fischer listed the ten greatest players in history. Fischer did not include Lasker in the list, deriding him as a &quot;coffee-house player [who] knew nothing about openings and didn&#x27;t understand positional chess&quot;. In a poll of the world&#x27;s leading players taken some time after Fischer&#x27;s list appeared, Tal, Korchnoi, and Robert Byrne all said that Lasker was the greatest player ever. Both Pal Benko and Byrne stated that Fischer later reconsidered and said that Lasker was a great player.

Statistical ranking systems place Lasker high among the greatest players of all time. The book &quot;Warriors of the Mind&quot; places him sixth, behind Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, Fischer, Mikhail Botvinnik and Capablanca. In his 1978 book &quot;The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present&quot;, Arpad Elo gave retrospective ratings to players based on their performance over the best five-year span of their career. He concluded that Lasker was the joint second strongest player of those surveyed (tied with Botvinnik and behind Capablanca). The most up-to-date system, Chessmetrics, is rather sensitive to the length of the periods being compared, and ranks Lasker between fifth and second strongest of all time for peak periods ranging in length from one to twenty years. Its author, the statistician Jeff Sonas, concluded that only Kasparov and Karpov surpassed Lasker&#x27;s long-term dominance of the game. By Chessmetrics&#x27; reckoning, Lasker was the number 1 player in 292 different months—a total of over 24 years. His first No. 1 rank was in June 1890, and his last in December 1926—a span of 36½ years. Chessmetrics also considers him the strongest 67-year-old in history: in December 1935, at age 67 years and 0 months, his rating was 2691 (number 7 in the world), well above second-place Viktor Korchnoi&#x27;s rating at that age (2660, number 39 in the world, in March 1998).

=== Influence on chess ===

Lasker founded no school of players who played in a similar style. Max Euwe, World Champion 1935–1937 and a prolific writer of chess manuals, who had a lifetime 0–3 score against Lasker, said, &quot;It is not possible to learn much from him. One can only stand and wonder.&quot; However, Lasker&#x27;s pragmatic, combative approach had a great influence on Soviet players like Mikhail Tal and Viktor Korchnoi.

There are several &quot;Lasker Variations&quot; in the chess openings, including Lasker&#x27;s Defense to the Queen&#x27;s Gambit, Lasker&#x27;s Defense to the Evans Gambit (which effectively ended the use of this gambit in tournament play until a revival in the 1990s), and the Lasker Variation in the McCutcheon Variation of the French Defense.

Lasker was shocked by the poverty in which Wilhelm Steinitz died and did not intend to die in similar circumstances. He became notorious for demanding high fees for playing matches and tournaments, and he argued that players should own the copyright in their games rather than let publishers get all the profits. These demands initially angered editors and other players, but helped to pave the way for the rise of full-time chess professionals who earn most of their living from playing, writing and teaching. Copyright in chess games had been contentious at least as far back as the mid-1840s, and Steinitz and Lasker vigorously asserted that players should own the copyright and wrote copyright clauses into their match contracts. However, Lasker&#x27;s demands that challengers should raise large purses prevented or delayed some eagerly awaited World Championship matches—for example Frank James Marshall challenged him in 1904 to a match for the World Championship but could not raise the stakes demanded by Lasker until 1907. This problem continued throughout the reign of his successor, Capablanca.

Some of the controversial conditions that Lasker insisted on for championship matches led Capablanca to attempt twice (1914 and 1922) to publish rules for such matches, to which other top players readily agreed.

=== Work in other fields ===
In his 1905 article on commutative algebra, Lasker introduced the theory of primary decomposition of ideals, which has influence in the theory of Noetherian rings. Rings having the &quot;primary decomposition property&quot; are called &quot;Laskerian rings&quot; in his honor.

His attempt to create a general theory of all competitive activities were followed by more consistent efforts from von Neumann on game theory, and his later writings about card games presented a significant issue in the mathematical analysis of card games.
According to R. J. Nowakowski, he &quot;came close to a complete theory of impartial games&quot;.

However, his dramatic and philosophical works have never been highly regarded.

==Death==
Lasker died of a kidney infection in New York on January 11, 1941, at the age of 72, as a charity patient at the Mount Sinai Hospital. His funeral service was held at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, and he was buried at historic Beth Olam Cemetery, Queens, New York.

== Personal life, family and friends==
His wife Martha and his sister, Mrs. Lotta Hirschberg, survived him.

Poet Else Lasker-Schüler was his sister-in-law.

Edward Lasker, born in Kempen (Kępno), Greater Poland (then Prussia), the German-American chess master, engineer, and author, claimed that he was distantly related to Emanuel Lasker. They both played in the great New York 1924 chess tournament.

Lasker was a good friend of Albert Einstein, who wrote the introduction to the posthumous biography &quot;Emanuel Lasker, The Life of a Chess Master&quot; by Dr. Jacques Hannak (1952). In this preface Einstein expresses his satisfaction at having met Lasker, writing:

==In popular culture==
In Michael Chabon&#x27;s alternate history mystery novel, &quot;The Yiddish Policemen&#x27;s Union&quot;, the murdered man, Mendel Shpilman (born during the 1960s), being a chess enthusiast, uses the name &quot;Emanuel Lasker&quot; as an alias. The reference is clearly understood by the protagonist, Detective Meyer Landsman, because he has also studied chess.

== Tournament results ==
The following table gives Lasker&#x27;s placings and scores in tournaments. The first &quot;Score&quot; column gives the number of points on the total possible. In the second &quot;Score&quot; column, &quot;+&quot; indicates the number of won games, &quot;−&quot; the number of losses, and &quot;=&quot; the number of draws.

== Match results ==
Here are Lasker&#x27;s results in matches. The first &quot;Score&quot; column gives the number of points on the total possible. In the second &quot;Score&quot; column, &quot;+&quot; indicates the number of won games, &quot;−&quot; the number of losses, and &quot;=&quot; the number of draws.

== Notable games ==
*Lasker vs. Johann Hermann Bauer, Amsterdam 1889. Although this was not the earliest-known game with a successful two-bishops sacrifice, this combination is now known as a &quot;Lasker–Bauer combination&quot; or &quot;Lasker sacrifice&quot;.
*Harry Nelson Pillsbury vs. Lasker, St Petersburg 1895. A brilliant sacrifice on the 17th move leads to a victorious attack.
*Wilhelm Steinitz vs. Lasker, London 1899. The old champion and the new one really go for it.
*Frank James Marshall vs. Lasker, World Championship Match 1907, game 1. Lasker&#x27;s attack is insufficient for a quick win, so he trades it in for an endgame in which he quickly ties Marshall in knots.
*Lasker vs. Carl Schlechter, match 1910, game 10. Not a great game, but the one that saved Lasker from losing his world title in 1910.
*Lasker vs. Jose Raul Capablanca, St Petersburg 1914. Lasker, who needed a win here, surprisingly used a opening, allowing Capablanca to the game early. There has been much debate about whether Lasker&#x27;s approach represented subtle psychology or deep positional understanding.
*Max Euwe vs. Lasker, Zurich 1934. 66-year-old Lasker beats a future World Champion, sacrificing his queen to turn defence into attack.

<doc id="244652" wikidata="Q16902315" url="?curid=244652" title="United Services College">
<text>The United Services College was an English boys&#x27; public school for the sons of military officers and civil servants, located from 1874 at Westward Ho! near Bideford in North Devon, from 1904 at Harpenden, Hertfordshire, and finally at Windsor, Berkshire. Almost all boys were boarders. The school was founded to prepare pupils for a career as officers in the armed services, many of them going on to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, or the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth.

==History==
The college was founded in 1874. Its first headmaster, Cormell Price, took twelve boys with him to the new school from Haileybury College, where he had been a housemaster.

For its home the school occupied a terrace of twelve substantial villas, recently built, which still survive under the name of Kipling Terrace. In his book &quot;Schooldays with Kipling&quot; (1936), George Beresford noted that as the villas and hotels of Westward Ho! were not a thriving township, it was easy for the school to lease &quot;ample acreage for football and cricket fields&quot;. 

Rudyard Kipling was a boy at the school from 1878 to 1882, and his book &quot;Stalky &amp; Co.&quot; (1899), set in a school referred to as &quot;the Coll.&quot;, was based on his years at the United Services College.

Cormell Price retired as headmaster in 1894, and this event was marked by a speech by Kipling, already the most notable former pupil, on 25 July 1894. The speech was later printed in &quot;Kipling&#x27;s College&quot; (1929).

The College suffered financial difficulties in 1903, and after rumours about its future had circulated came newspaper reports in July of that year that &quot;The United Services College. Westward Ho! ... is to be merged in an Imperial Service College, which is to be built.&quot; It was still at Westward Ho! under the headmastership of the Rev. F. W. Tracy, M.A. in February 1904, but in April 1904, the Senior Division of the school was re-opened at Harpenden, in Hertfordshire, and the Junior Division at Bognor, Sussex. 
At Harpenden, the school took over the empty buildings of St George&#x27;s School. Only temporary arrangements were made at first , while the Imperial Service College Trust raised funds. It did not stay there long, as it could not come to terms with its new landlord.

Between 20 and 22 June of 1904, a public auction of the school&#x27;s furniture and equipment at Westward Ho! took place. The school remained divided between Harpenden and Bognor in 1905. In April 1906 came an announcement that the Senior Division, still under F. W. Tracy, was to move to Onslow Hall, Richmond Green, on 4 May. In the event, it stayed there only for the Summer term.

The school next merged with St Mark&#x27;s School, Windsor, later in 1906, but it continued to use the name &quot;United Services College, Windsor&quot;, until 1911. It was then renamed as &quot;Imperial Service College&quot;, and this was merged with Haileybury College in 1942.

As at virtually all boys&#x27; schools of its era, corporal punishment (strokes of the cane) was used, but USC was very unusual in that the cane was applied to the student&#x27;s upper back (as described by Kipling) rather than the buttocks.

==Notable former pupils==

*Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936), writer. His collection of stories, &quot;Stalky &amp; Co&quot;, is based on his experiences at the College, which he joined in January 1878 and left in the summer of 1882. He dedicated the book to Cormell Price, headmaster of the school for its first twenty years, and Price is portrayed in it as someone the boys respected.
*Major-General Lionel Dunsterville CB, CSI (1865–1946), a contemporary of Kipling, and the inspiration for the character of Stalky in the &quot;Stalky &amp; Co.&quot; stories
*George Charles Beresford (1864–1938), photographer, inspiration for &quot;M&#x27;Turk&quot; in &quot;Stalky &amp; Co.&quot;

<text>Robert Crow (13 June 196111 March 2014) was an English trade union leader who served as the General Secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) from 2002 until his death in 2014. He was also a member of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC). A self-described &quot;communist/socialist&quot;, he was a leading figure in the No to EU – Yes to Democracy campaign.

Crow joined London Transport in 1977 and soon became involved in trade unionism. He was regarded as part of the Awkward Squad, a loose grouping of left-wing union leaders who came to power in a series of electoral victories beginning in 2002. After he became leader, the RMT&#x27;s membership increased from around 57,000 in 2002 to more than 80,000 in 2008, making it one of Britain&#x27;s fastest-growing trade unions.

Crow was a polarising figure in British politics. Supporters praised him as a champion of the working class and a successful trade unionist; Boris Johnson argued that he held London to ransom with strikes.

== Early life ==
Born at 162 Burrow Road, Epping, Essex to Lillian (&quot;née&quot; Hutton) and George Crow; his background was working-class, a fact of which he remained proud throughout his life. Crow&#x27;s father was a docker who taught him to read both the &quot;Morning Star&quot; and the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, but to disbelieve everything in the latter. His father also was a lifelong member of the Transport and General Workers Union. His family subsequently moved to Hainault. He left school at 16 and joined London Transport, where he became involved in union politics. His first job was making the tea, then he worked as part of a tree-felling group in 1977, before moving onto heavy track repairing. In 1983, he was elected as a local representative to the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) and in 1985 became NUR national officer for track workers.

During his formative years, prominent figures such as Jack Jones, Hugh Scanlon, Joe Gormley, and Len Murray dominated the British trade union movement. As a result, he commented that &quot;Starting my career with these people in charge of unions, and working in a nationalised industry with people who had put in 30 or even 40 years of service helped shape my views.&quot; He was a great lover of soul music in his teens often to be found dancing to jazz-funk and reggae in working mans clubs and pubs across London and Essex.

== Trade union career and politics ==
In 1990 the National Union of Railwaymen merged with the National Union of Seamen to form the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT). The following year Crow became the London Underground representative on the National Executive. In 1991, he became assistant general secretary, and on 14 February 2002, he membership elected Crow to succeed Jimmy Knapp as general secretary. He received 12,051 votes in the election – nearly twice as many as the other two candidates (Phil Bialyk received 4,512 votes and Ray Spry-Shute received 1,997). Six weeks earlier on 1 January 2002, Crow was attacked outside his home by two men wielding an iron bar. He speculated that he was the victim of hired employer muscle, although it is possible, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, that the culprits were members of far right activist groups who were active in Dagenham at the time. Crow was a member of the General Council of the Trade Union Congress. From 2006 until his death, he was a member of the Executive Board of the International Transport Workers Federation, the global trade union for transport workers.

Under Bob Crow&#x27;s leadership, the RMT affiliated to the World Federation of Trade Unions and he was regularly invited to attend, in his capacity as general secretary of the RMT, the presidential council of the WFTU.

At the time he became general secretary, he had a strong negotiating position as the industry was booming, and was the leader of one of the only British trade unions which still wielded industrial strength.

=== Communist Party and Socialist Labour Party ===
Crow identified as a &quot;communist/socialist&quot;, and between 1983 and 1997, was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain and then the Communist Party of Britain.

He described his political philosophy with a quote from Argentine Marxist–Leninist revolutionary Che Guevara: &quot;Hasta la victoria siempre!&quot; (&quot;Forever onwards until the victory!&quot;). He kept a bust of communist leader Vladimir Lenin in his office. He described the aims of a trade-unionist as to secure &quot;Job security, being safe, best possible pay, best possible conditions, decent pensions, and a world that lives in peace.&quot;

In 1997 he briefly joined Arthur Scargill&#x27;s Socialist Labour Party (SLP), and was always a strong supporter of Scargill for his commitment to trade unionism. Crow rejected the argument that Scargill was responsible for the defeats of the miners and the union movement more generally.

Crow was a founding member of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition for several years until his death. Previously, he supported the now disbanded Socialist Alliance, and believed all socialist parties should unite. In the 2005 general election, he endorsed Robert Griffiths, the Communist Party of Britain candidate in Pontypridd, calling him &quot;a champion of workers&#x27; rights&quot;. Griffiths went on to win 233 votes (0.6%), coming last out of the six candidates. In the 2010 Local Election, he publicly supported the directly elected Mayoral candidate in the London Borough of Hackney Monty Goldman and the candidate for Leabridge Ward Mick Carty.

=== Campaign for a New Workers&#x27; Party ===
Crow was an outspoken critic of Tony Blair, who &quot;squandered a massive landslide from an electorate hungry for change, poured billions of public pounds into private pockets and accelerated the growing gap between rich and poor&quot;. He deemed the policies implemented by Blair&#x27;s New Labour project to be &quot;near enough identical&quot; to those of the Conservatives.

Speaking at the founding conference of the National Shop Stewards Network in July 2007, Crow called for a new party for the working class.

In 2013, Crow accused then Labour leader Ed Miliband of showing unions contempt. He again called on trade unions to break ties with Labour and create a new party to challenge the &quot;anti-worker&quot; agenda of the mainstream political parties.

=== RMT industrial action ===
After Transport for London offered workers an inflation-adjusted pay rise, Crow described TfL&#x27;s approach to pay as &quot;confrontational&quot;.

In response to the RMT declaring a 48-hour strike on 10 June 2009, Crow wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; Comment is free section the purpose of the move: &quot;On London Underground, bosses are threatening to tear up an agreement aimed at safeguarding jobs, and have refused to rule out compulsory redundancies. Up to 4,000 jobs are at risk as part of a multibillion-pound cuts package that can be traced directly back to the collapse of Metronet and the failure of the PPP.&quot;

&quot;RMT have made it clear we expect managers to abide by the existing job security agreements and we would simply not be doing our job as a union if we allowed the tube to treat our members as cannon fodder who can be hired and fired at will&quot;, adding that &quot;It wasn&#x27;t our members who created the downturn and we will not be bullied into accepting that they should be forced to pay for an economic crisis that was cooked up by the bankers and the politicians.&quot;

Rail managers recognised Crow as a moderate within the RMT; he faced calls from figures to the left of him who were more eager to use industrial action. He was also criticised by RMT members on the right of his position; Crow repeatedly championed the cause of the lowest-paid workers, such as cleaners, whose jobs were often outsourced to separate companies. Sectors of the more highly-paid RMT membership were critical of Crow for this support, believing it inefficient.

=== No to EU – Yes to Democracy ===
In March 2009, Crow announced that the RMT would be fronting the No to EU – Yes to Democracy platform with an array of socialist organisations and individuals for the 2009 European Parliament elections. No2EU – Yes to Democracy stood for a Europe of &quot;independent, democratic states that value its public services and does not offer them to profiteers; a Europe that guarantees the rights of workers and does not put the interests of big business above that of ordinary people&quot;.

As the party leader and lead candidate in London, Crow was &quot;not against workers coming into the country&quot;, unlike other Eurosceptic groupings, but he was against &quot;two workers from different countries competing against each other on different rates of pay&quot; and added that &quot;Our main role will be out there among working people, giving them our support and helping to save their industries from privatisation&quot;.

No2EU secured 153,236 votes, compared to an RMT membership of 80,000. The party achieved 1% of the popular vote in Britain, giving them the 12th largest share of the vote, behind Scargill&#x27;s Socialist Labour Party and the far-right British National Party. This was insufficient for a seat in the European Parliament. In London, where Crow was a candidate, the party secured 17,758 votes, equating to the tenth largest vote share. No2EU secured a larger share of the popular vote in this region than the Socialist Labour Party.

=== Accusation of cronyism ===
When it became known that Crow&#x27;s wife had been appointed chief executive of the RMT credit union, the Milton Keynes RMT branch secretary stated he was filling posts with &quot;henchmen&quot;. Crow responded that his wife was the only applicant for the position, and he had interviewed her for the role.

=== Salary ===
The BBC reported Crow&#x27;s annual salary as £145,000. It was pointed out by a journalist for &quot;The Independent&quot; that the correct figure was around £96,000, and this was also mentioned by Crow in interview. According to the Trades Union Certification Officer, in 2012 Crow&#x27;s basic salary at the RMT was £89,805. The union also paid £10,313 of National Insurance contributions and £34,429 into his pension in 2012. No car or chauffeur was provided. Discussing his salary in a BBC interview, Crow stated &quot;I&#x27;m worth it&quot;. The &quot;Telegraph&quot; agreed that it was deserved for Crow who &quot;represented the interests of his members with a single-minded determination&quot;. The newspaper concluded Crow &quot;wanted the best deal for the people who paid his salary – and they continued to reward him because he delivered it.&quot;

=== Final years: 2013–14 ===
After the death of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in April 2013, Crow stated: &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned she can rot in Hell.&quot; In January 2014, Crow went on a cruise from Barbados to Brazil and was photographed by paparazzi on Copacabana Beach. Crow commented: &quot;What do you want me to do? Sit under a tree and read Karl Marx all day?&quot;.

When a &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reporter asked him in February 2014 if he felt sorry for commuters, he responded: &quot;Course I feel sorry for them. But they know our fight isn&#x27;t with them. It&#x27;s with Transport for London. And what do they expect a trade union to do? If you join one you expect it to fight for your rights and your job – and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing.&quot;

Crow died in the early hours of 11 March 2014 at Whipps Cross University Hospital after suffering an aneurysm and heart attack.

== Personal life ==
Crow advocated the UK to withdraw from the European Union. Since childhood, he had supported Millwall Football Club, and as RMT leader he kept a photograph of the club on the wall of his office. He was known to be a fan of boxing, and in an interview from 2011, claimed to work out six days a week, and be able to bench-press . He also had a pet Staffordshire bull terrier whom he named Castro after the Cuban Marxist–Leninist leader Fidel Castro.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; described Crow as having &quot;a very keen brain and strong emotional intelligence&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; deemed him to be both &quot;confrontational and charismatic&quot; and &quot;sharp and shrewd&quot;. Crow took a keen interest in the weather and owned a barometer, informing the press that if he had not become a trade unionist then he would have liked to have become a weather man.

Despite the many portrayals as a radical socialist Crow was rather seen to be very pragmatic in outlook, and was described as &quot;too shrewd for doctrine&quot;. Although believing that it was morally right to punish murder by capital punishment, he did not support the death penalty in practice, claiming too little faith in the criminal justice system. Similarly, he said that he would happily support the Conservative Party if by doing so he could achieve the renationalisation of the railways.

Crow&#x27;s marriage to Geraldine Horan, on 12 June 1982, by whom he had a daughter, Kerrie-Anne, and two grandsons, Daniel and Jamie Atlee, ended in divorce. He later entered a long-term relationship with Nicola Hoarau, with whom he had another daughter, Tanya. Writing in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, George Eaton thought Crow to have been &quot;more hurt than most realise by the press intrusion into his private life&quot;.

Crow had a distinctive south-east accent described variously as Cockney or soft-spoken Essex. He was often to be seen in the stands of Millwall FC in his trademark flat cap.

He lived in a three-bedroom council house in Woodford Green, eastern Greater London. When asked why he lived in a council house despite his high income , Crow said &quot;I was born in a council house, as far as I&#x27;m concerned I will die in one.&quot;

Crow played up to the caricature of himself created by the press, by, for example, describing bankers as greedy &quot;spivs&quot;. Crow was once asked by a journalist from the &quot;Financial Times&quot; how he would feel if his children had chosen careers in banking. He responded that he was happy for them to live their lives. He revealed that his brother was a stockbroker but that he was more concerned about the fact his brother supported Arsenal F.C.

In 2011, lawyers acting for Crow wrote to the Metropolitan Police asking for any evidence or information that they may have uncovered in respect of the News International phone hacking scandal. Crow had suspicions that &quot;journalists may have had access to private information about my movements and my union&#x27;s activities that date back to the year 2000&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Crow had a polarising effect in British politics, becoming &quot;the left&#x27;s favourite firebrand and the right&#x27;s favourite villain.&quot; To supporters, he was a working-class hero who successfully stood up for the rights of RMT members. Deemed highly successful in his job, during his leadership of the RMT, membership rose from 59,000 to 78,000, while London tube drivers&#x27; pay rose to £52,000, nearly twice the national average wage. Discussing Crow&#x27;s contribution, former mayor of London Ken Livingstone said that &quot;The only working-class people who still have well-paid jobs in London are [RMT] members&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; asserted that he &quot;managed to popularise the cause of trade unions at a time of declining membership and increasing hostility&quot;. BBC News commented that he had managed to become &quot;one of the UK&#x27;s best-known characters at a time when the rest of the nation&#x27;s trade union movement had faded into comparative obscurity&quot;.

However, Crow was regularly criticised by both the right and the centre-left. Critics saw him as a bully who improved the status of RMT workers at the expense of commuters. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; deemed him a &quot;champagne socialist&quot; for his lavish lifestyle.

Following Crow&#x27;s death, tributes were offered by figures from the trade union movement. TUC Secretary-General Frances O&#x27;Grady called him &quot;an outstanding trade unionist, who tirelessly fought for his members, his industry and the wider trade union movement&quot;. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, stated that Crow &quot;was admired by his members and feared by employers, which is exactly how he liked it... It was a privilege to campaign and fight alongside him because he never gave an inch.&quot; Tributes were also offered by politicians on the political left. Livingstone asserted that the RMT leader was &quot;broadly right on most key issues&quot; and that &quot;He fought really hard for his members.&quot; Leader of the Labour Party Ed Miliband commented that &quot;I didn&#x27;t always agree with him politically but I always respected his tireless commitment to fighting for the men and women in his union. He did what he was elected to do, was not afraid of controversy and was always out supporting his members across the country.&quot;

His death also drew responses from the political right. Conservative Mayor of London Boris Johnson stated: &quot;I&#x27;m shocked. Bob Crow was a fighter and a man of character... Whatever our political differences, and there were many, this is tragic news... Bob fought tirelessly for his beliefs and for his members. There can be absolutely no doubt that he played a big part in the success of the Tube, and he shared my goal to make transport in London an even greater success.&quot; A spokesman speaking for Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron commented that &quot;The Prime Minister expresses his sincere condolences to Mr Crow&#x27;s family and friends.&quot; Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party, tweeted to express his sadness at Crow&#x27;s death, commenting that &quot;I liked him&quot; and that he had found common ground over their mutual anti-EU sentiment. On his death, management at Transport for London placed posters marking his death at tube stations throughout London as a mark of respect.

=== Bob Crow Brigade ===
The Bob Crow Brigade is a group of volunteers from the UK and the Republic of Ireland fighting as part of the International Freedom Battalion (IFB). The IFB consists of leftist foreign volunteers fighting alongside the People&#x27;s Protection Units in the Syrian Civil War in support of the Rojava Revolution and against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The group has expressed solidarity with the RMT and striking rail workers in the UK. Steve Hedley, senior assistant general secretary of the RMT, said: &quot;Bob would have been honoured that young people from Britain would fight the forces of evil in his name. A great admirer of the international brigades that fought in Spain, Crow would of course have drawn the parallels with the new international brigades fighting clerical fascism and defending Yazhidi, Muslim and Christian workers from slavery and persecution.&quot;

<text>William Russell (born 23 August 1946) is an English dramatist, lyricist and composer. His best known works are &quot;Educating Rita&quot;, &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot;, &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; and &quot;Our Day Out&quot;.

==Early life==
Russell was born in Whiston, Lancashire (which is now Merseyside). On leaving school, aged 15, he became a women&#x27;s hairdresser, eventually running his own salon, until the age of 20 when he decided to go back to college. This led to him qualifying as a teacher. During these years, Russell also worked as a semi-professional singer, writing and performing his own songs in folk clubs.

At college, he began writing drama and, in 1972, took a programme of three one-act plays to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where they were seen by writer John McGrath, who recommended Russell to the Liverpool Everyman, which commissioned the adaptation, &quot;When The Reds…&quot;, Russell&#x27;s first professional work for theatre.

==Career==
Russell&#x27;s first play was &quot;Keep Your Eyes Down&quot; (1971), written while he trained as a teacher at Saint Katherine&#x27;s College of Higher Education in Liverpool and performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1971.

In 1974 Russell wrote &quot;John, Paul, George, Ringo ... and Bert&quot;, a musical about the Beatles. Commissioned by the Liverpool Everyman, it ran for a (then) unprecedented eight weeks before transferring to the West End where it ran for over a year, winning the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and London Theatre Critics awards for the best musical of 1974. It premiered at the Everyman Theatre, Liverpool, and then transferred to the Lyric Theatre in the West End in 1974.

Alongside further stage works, &quot;One for the Road&quot; (1976) and &quot;Stags and Hens&quot; (1978), Russell was a screenwriter with television films, &quot;Death of A Young Young Man&quot; (1975, BBC1), &quot;Daughters of Albion&quot; (1979), &quot;Our Day Out&quot; (1977) and the five-part serial &quot;One Summer&quot; (1983).

Commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company, &quot;Educating Rita&quot; premiered at the Warehouse, London in 1980 and transferred to the West End Piccadilly Theatre, London in August 1980, and starred Julie Walters and Mark Kingston. Since its premiere and long West End run (the play ran to &quot;at least&quot; June 1982), the play has been translated and produced in almost every part the globe garnering awards both for its author and for many of the actors who have played the roles of Rita and Frank.

Returning to the Liverpool Everyman in 1986, Russell wrote &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; which went on to an acclaimed West End run, earning Olivier Awards for both its author (Comedy of the Year) and star Pauline Collins (Actress of the Year in a New Play). The play transferred to New York for a highly successful Broadway run in February 1989 to November 1989, and a Tony Award as Best Actress for Collins.

Both &quot;Educating Rita&quot; (1983) and &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; (1989) became feature films with Michael Caine, Julie Walters and Pauline Collins all receiving Oscar nominations for their respective roles, as did Russell for his &quot;Educating Rita&quot; screenplay.

Russell&#x27;s other worldwide theatrical success has been &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, &quot;a Liverpudlian folk opera&quot; about a pair of twins separated at birth and brought up in completely different environments. It won the Olivier Award for Best New Musical in 1983. Its 1988 revival had over 10,000 consecutive performances during its 24-year West End run, which ended in November 2012. Simultaneously, there were UK touring and international productions, including a two-year run on Broadway starting in 1993. The Broadway production was nominated for the 1993 Tony Award, Best Musical.

In 1985, Russell co-wrote the song &quot;The Show&quot;, the theme for the TV series &quot;Connie&quot; with series creator Ron Hutchinson. The song was performed by vocalist Rebecca Storm and released as a single by Towerbell Records in June 1985, reaching number 22 on the UK Singles Chart.

Russell (with musical collaborator Bob Eaton) realised a long-held ambition to develop &quot;Our Day Out&quot; further and after extensive rewriting, and recomposing created &quot;Our Day Out – The Musical&quot;. This modern musical retelling retains all the characters and plot of the original but with the action brought forward to today with a new score and lyrics to reflect this twenty first century setting. The musical was produced in 2010 at the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool.

&quot;The Wrong Boy&quot;, Willy Russell&#x27;s first novel, was published in 2000. In 2004, Russell returned to his original singer/songwriter roots, releasing his album, &quot;Hoovering the Moon&quot; on Pure Records. Russell also co-produced the Tim Firth album &quot;Harmless Flirting&quot;.

In 2013, the Archive and Special Collections department of Liverpool John Moores University established the Willy Russell Archive containing manuscripts, programmes, publicity and media material including newspaper cuttings and press releases, correspondence, legal, financial and administrative documents, records relating to the casting and audition process, audio and film material, and promotional ephemera. The material was produced throughout the course of Russell&#x27;s career and is a comprehensive representation of his work to date. It also illustrates Russell&#x27;s collaborative works, both written and musical.

==Personal life==
In 1969, Russell married Annie Seagroatt; the couple have one son, Rob, and two daughters, Rachel and Ruth.

<doc id="244658" wikidata="Q1323569" url="?curid=244658" title="Skewer">
<text>A skewer is a thin metal or wood stick used to hold pieces of food together. The word may sometimes be used as a metonym, to refer to the entire food item served on a skewer, as in &quot;chicken skewers&quot;. Skewers are used while grilling or roasting meats and fish, and in other culinary applications.

In English, brochette is a borrowing of the French word for skewer. In cookery, &quot;en brochette&quot; means &#x27;on a skewer&#x27;, and describes the form of a dish or the method of cooking and serving pieces of food, especially grilled meat or seafood, on skewers; for example &quot;lamb cubes en brochette&quot;. Skewers are often used in a variety of kebab dishes.

== Utensil ==
Metal skewers are typically stainless steel rods with a pointed tip on one end and a grip of some kind on the other end for ease of removing the food. Non-metallic skewers are often made from bamboo, as well as hardwoods such as birch, beech, or other suitable wood. Prior to grilling, wooden skewers may be soaked in water to avoid burning. A related device is the rotisserie or spit, a large rod that rotates meat while it cooks.

== History ==
At the 300,000-year-old Schöningen site in Germany. A stick with a burnt tip was suggested to have been used to cook meat over a fire, though later scholars have questioned this interpretation. Excavations of the Minoan settlement of Akrotiri unearthed stone &quot;fire dogs&quot; used before the 17th century BCE. In these supports there are pairs of indentations that may have been used for holding skewers. Homer in &quot;Iliad&quot; (1.465) mentions pieces of meat roasted on spits (, ). In Classical Greece, a small spit or skewer was known as (), and Aristophanes mentions such skewers being used to roast thrushes. The story is often told of medieval Middle Eastern soldiers - usually Turkish or Persian, depending on the storyteller – who cooked meat skewered on their swords.

One of the most well-known skewered foods around the world is the shish kebab. The earliest literary evidence for the Turkish word (shish) as a food utensil comes from the 11th-century , attributed to Mahmud of Kashgar. He defines shish as both a skewer and &#x27;tool for arranging noodles&#x27; (), though he is unique in this regard as all subsequent known historical references to &quot;shish&quot; define it as a skewer.

== Examples of skewered foods ==
===Kebab===

A large variety of dishes cooked on skewers are kebabs (meat dishes prevalent in Middle Eastern cuisine and the Muslim world), or derived from them. Examples include Turkish &quot;shish kebab&quot;, Iranian &quot;jujeh kabab&quot;, Chinese &quot;chuan&quot;, and Southeast Asian satay. However, &quot;kebab&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;skewered food&quot;, and many kebab dishes such as chapli kebab are not cooked on skewers. On the other hand, English speakers may sometimes use the word &quot;kebab&quot; to refer to any food on a skewer.

===Other===
Dishes, other than kebabs, prepared with skewers include American city chicken and corn dog, Brazilian &quot;churrasco&quot;, indigenous Peruvian &quot;anticucho&quot;, Indonesian &quot;satay&quot;, Italian &quot;arrosticini&quot;, Greek &quot;souvlaki&quot;, Japanese &quot;kushiyaki&quot; and &quot;kushikatsu&quot;, Korean &quot;jeok&quot; and &quot;kkochi&quot;, Nepali &quot;sekuwa&quot;, Portuguese &quot;espetada&quot;, Serbian &quot;ražnjići&quot;, Vietnamese &quot;nem nướng&quot; and &quot;chạo tôm&quot;, Chinese &quot;shaokao,&quot; and Malaysian-Singaporean &quot;Lok-lok&quot;.

Appetizers and hors d&#x27;oeuvres may often be skewered together with small sticks or toothpicks; the Spanish pincho is named after such a skewer. Small, often decorative, skewers of glass, metal, wood or bamboo known as olive picks or cocktail sticks are used for garnishes on cocktails and other alcoholic beverages. Many types of snack food, such as candy apples, bananacue, &quot;ginanggang&quot;, &quot;elote&quot;, , and &quot;tanghulu&quot;, are sold and served &quot;on a stick&quot; or skewer, especially at outdoor markets, fairs, and sidewalk or roadside stands around the world.

<doc id="244659" wikidata="Q1476619" url="?curid=244659" title="Their Eyes Were Watching God">
<text>Their Eyes Were Watching God is a 1937 novel by American writer Zora Neale Hurston. It is considered a classic of the Harlem Renaissance, and Hurston&#x27;s best known work. The novel explores protagonist Janie Crawford&#x27;s &quot;ripening from a vibrant, but voiceless, teenage girl into a woman with her finger on the trigger of her own destiny&quot;.

Set in central and southern Florida in the early 20th century, the novel was initially poorly received. Since the late 20th century, however, it has been regarded as influential to both African-American literature and women&#x27;s literature. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the novel in its 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923.

==Plot synopsis==
Janie Crawford, an African-American woman in her forties, returns to her old town, after a year-long absence, and recounts her life story, along with the time she had been gone to her friend, Pheoby. Janie starts with her sexual awakening, comparing it to a blossoming pear tree kissed by bees in spring, that occurs when she allows a local boy, Johnny Taylor, to kiss her, which Janie&#x27;s grandmother, Nanny, witnesses.

As a young enslaved woman, Nanny was raped by her white enslaver, then gave birth to a mixed-race daughter that she named Leafy. Though Nanny wanted a better life for her daughter and even escaped her jealous mistress, after the American Civil War, Leafy was later raped by her school teacher and became pregnant with Janie. Shortly after Janie&#x27;s birth, Leafy began to drink and stay out at night, eventually abandoning the baby and leaving Janie with Nanny.

Nanny, having transferred her hopes for stability and opportunity from Leafy to Janie, arranges for Janie to marry Logan Killicks, an older farmer looking for a wife. However, Killicks does not love Janie and wants only a domestic helper, rather than a lover or partner; he thinks she does not do enough around the farm and considers her ungrateful. When Janie speaks to Nanny about her desire for love, Nanny, too, accuses Janie of being spoiled and, soon afterwards, dies.

Unhappy, disillusioned, and lonely, Janie leaves Killicks and runs off with Joe &quot;Jody&quot; Starks, a glib man who takes her to the all-black community of Eatonville, Florida. Starks arranges to buy more land, establishes a general store, and is soon elected mayor of the town. However, Janie soon realizes that Starks wants her as a trophy wife to reinforce his powerful position in town and to run the store, even forbidding her from taking part in the town&#x27;s social life. During their twenty-year marriage, he treats her as his property, criticizing her, controlling her, and physically abusing her. Finally, when Starks&#x27;s kidney begins to fail, Janie says that he never knew her, because he would not let her be free.

After Starks dies, Janie becomes financially independent, through his estate. Though she is beset with suitors, including men of means, she turns them all down, until she meets a young drifter and gambler named Vergible Woods, known as &quot;Tea Cake.” He plays the guitar for her and initially treats her with kindness and respect. Janie is hesitant, because she is older and wealthy, but she eventually falls in love with him and decides to run away with him to Jacksonville to marry. They move to Belle Glade, in the northern part of the Everglades region (&quot;the muck&quot;), where they find work planting and harvesting beans. While their relationship is volatile and sometimes violent, Janie finally has the loving marriage that she always wanted. Her image of the pear tree blossom is revived.
Suddenly, the area is hit by the great 1928 Okeechobee hurricane. Tea Cake is bitten by a dog, while saving Janie from drowning, and develops rabies. He becomes hydrophobic and increasingly jealous and unpredictable. When he tries to shoot Janie with his pistol, she fatally shoots him with a rifle, in self-defense, and she is charged with murder.

At the trial, Tea Cake&#x27;s black male friends show up to oppose her, but a group of local white women arrives to support Janie. After the all-white jury acquits Janie, she gives Tea Cake a lavish funeral. Tea Cake&#x27;s friends forgive her, asking her to remain in the Everglades. However, she decides to return to Eatonville. As she expected, the residents gossip about her, when she returns to town. The story ends where it started, as Janie finishes recounting her life to Pheoby.

== Themes ==
=== Gender roles ===
The novel explores traditional gender roles and the relationship between men and women. Nanny believes that Janie should marry a man not for love, but for &quot;protection&quot;. Janie&#x27;s first two husbands, Logan Killicks and Jody Starks, both believe Janie should be defined by her marriage to them. Both men want her to be domesticated and silent. Her speech, or silence, is defined by her physical locations, most often. For example, Starks forces her silence at the store, a public—and therefore, male space at the time. He says: &quot;... Muh wife don&#x27;t know nothin&#x27; bout no speech-makin&#x27;. Ah never married her for nothin&#x27; lak dat. She&#x27;s ah woman[,] and her place is in de home.&quot; Janie is also forbidden from socializing with the townspeople on the porch. Tea Cake is Janie&#x27;s last husband, who treats her as more of an equal than Killicks and Starks did, by talking to her and playing checkers with her. 

Duke professor and Black feminist cultural critic, Mark Anthony Neal writes that Tea Cake defies the heteronormative roles of his own masculinity and Janie&#x27;s femininity in their relationship despite his domestic violence towards her. He writes: &quot;Tea Cake reads as progressive in opposition to traditional gender politics within black communities and institutions and the larger society during the era.&quot; Throughout the novel, Janie struggles with her agency in relation to domineering male figures, even Tea Cake whom she chose to love.

=== Masculinity and femininity ===
Scholars argue that, in &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;, the role of masculinity is portrayed through the subordination and objectification of women. In a reflection of post-slavery Florida, black men are subordinate only to their white employers and adhere to white patriarchal institutions of masculinity in which women are held in a positive social regard only if they are attractive, are married, or have attained financial security via previous marriages. Black women, specifically, face greater oppression, as their own struggle for independence was considered counter-productive to the greater fight for equality for black Americans as a whole. Nanny explains this hierarchical structure early on to Janie when she says: 

In the book, men view women as an object to pursue, acquire, and control through courting, manipulation, and even physical force. Janie&#x27;s journey for the discovery of her self-identity and independence is depicted through her pursuit of true love—her dream—through marriages to three different men. Each of the men she marries conforms in some way to gender norms of the day. The role of femininity is portrayed through the symbolism of property, mules, and elements in nature. Women in the book are considered a trophy prize for males, to simply look pretty and obey their husbands. The analogy of the Mule and Women is stated repetitively in the book and is used to represent the gender role of women. Janie&#x27;s Nanny explained to Janie at a young age how African-American women were objectified as mules. &quot;De nigger woman is de mule uh de world so far as Ah can see.&quot; Mules are typically bought and sold by farmers, usually to be used to work until exhaustion. Later in the book, Janie realizes that Nanny&#x27;s warnings were true when she identifies with an abused mule in Eatonville. She sees herself as a working animal with no voice, there for the amusement of others and at the expense of her own free will. This identification is shown in the book when the townspeople are laughing at the mule that Jody had eventually bought and rescued (in an attempt to manipulate Janie). However, Janie does not laugh alongside the townspeople as she is shown to empathize with the mule (&quot;Everybody was having fun at the mule-baiting. All but Janie&quot;) and she feels disgusted by the situation. The mule represents the feminine gender role in the story by which men suppress and degrade women who are stereotyped as unable to think for themselves and needing constant guidance from men. These stereotypes &quot;become a chain on the American women, preventing them from developing individuality, and from pursuing their personal happiness&quot; and ultimately what forces them to mold into their gender role. 

==== Janie Crawford ====

Janie Crawford is the main character of &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;. At the beginning of the story, she is described as naive, beautiful, and energetic. However, as the story progresses, Janie is constantly under the influence and pressure of gender norms within her romantic relationships. As she navigates each of her relationships with men, Janie ultimately loses her confidence and self-image, conforming to roles that the husbands want her to fill.

In Janie&#x27;s first relationship, she was given as a wife by Nanny at an early age and was told that love may come with marriage but that it was not important. However, as time passed, Janie was unable to love Logan. &quot;She began to cry. &#x27;Ah wants things sweet wid mah marriage lak when you sit under a pear tree and think.&#x27;&quot; As time passed on, Logan began forcing Janie to conform to a traditional lifestyle, telling her that he would buy a mule for her so that she could work. However, Janie was strong-minded and Logan made little progress on changing Janie. Janie raised her voice, but still she remained susceptible to suppression and abuse. &quot;You ain&#x27;t got no particular place. It&#x27;s wherever Ah need yuh. Git a move on yuh, and dat quick.&quot;

Then, in Janie&#x27;s second relationship, she left Logan Killicks in an attempt to pursue a better future with her new husband, Joe Starks. Joe was the Mayor of Eatonville and achieved incredible wealth, placing Janie in a higher status than her peers, since she was &quot;sleeping with authority, seating in a higher chair&quot;. Janie believed that her life would change for the better. However, she was confined in the roles of a housewife and was made to be Joe&#x27;s prized possession. &quot;The king&#x27;s mule, and the king&#x27;s pleasure is everything she is there for, nothing else&quot;.

In Janie&#x27;s third and last relationship, she was able to experience true love, on her own terms, with her third husband Vergible &quot;Tea Cake&quot; Woods. Janie was older than Tea Cake by nearly twelve years. He loved and treated her better than her previous husbands. While she was no longer strictly confined by the gender roles placed upon her by her previous husbands, she was still easily influenced and manipulated by Tea Cake. Janie was forced to shoot and kill Tea Cake in self-defense after he developed rabies.

==== Logan Killicks ====
Logan Killicks is Janie&#x27;s first husband. Shortly after Nanny observes Janie sharing her first kiss with a boy named Johnny Taylor—and therefore showing signs of puberty—she informs Janie that she was promised to Logan Killicks, a widower, from a young age for her own well-being and protection. Logan owns a farm with 60 acres of land. He grows and sells potatoes as well as chops and delivers wood. He has one mule to plow the fields and decides that he needs to add another to the stable. Though Janie hopes that it will grow, there is never any gentleness or love between her and Logan. She is 15 or 16 years old when she is married off to Logan and later, she grows to resent her grandmother for selling her off, like a slave.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurston 2006 https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780060838676/page/89 89&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Their marriage is purely based on logic, work and convenience—he is a man with property and he needs a wife while Nanny is an aging woman raising her grandchild alone, and she needs to secure Janie&#x27;s future. There is little regard for Janie&#x27;s happiness as Nanny believes Logan to be a good husband based on his financial prospects alone.

Logan has traditional views on marriage. He believes that a man should be married to a woman, and that she should be his property and work hard. Everyone contributes to tending the family land. He believes Janie should work well from dawn to dusk, in the field as well as the house, and do as she is told. She is analogous to a mule or other working animal. He is not an attractive man by Janie&#x27;s description of him and seems to be aware of this. As such, his prospects at finding a mate based on attraction and his age are slim, thus the reason for approaching Nanny early on about an arrangement of marriage to Janie when she comes of age.

During the course of their brief marriage, Logan attempts to subjugate Janie with his words and attempts to make her work beyond the gender roles in a typical marriage. He does not appreciate her streaks of independence when she refuses his commands and he uses her family history to try to manipulate her into being submissive to him. At one point, he threatens to kill her for her insubordination in a desperate and final attempt to control her.

==== Joe &quot;Jody&quot; Starks ====

Joe &quot;Jody&quot; Starks is Janie&#x27;s second husband. He is charismatic, charming and has big plans for his future. Janie, being young and naive, is easily seduced by his efforts to convince her to leave Logan. Ultimately, Joe is successful in gaining Janie&#x27;s trust and so she joins him on his journey. Joe views Janie as a princess or royalty to be displayed on a pedestal. Because of her youth, inexperience, and desire to find true love, Janie is easily controlled, and manipulated, into submitting to his male authority.

Joe Starks is a man who is strong, organized and a natural leader. He has money from his time working for white men and he now aims to settle in a new community made up of African-Americans, a place in its infancy where he can make a name for himself. Joe quickly establishes himself as an authoritative figure around the town which has no determined name or governance of any kind when he and Janie arrive. With the money he has, he buys land, organizes the townsfolk, becomes the owner-operator of the general store and post office, and is eventually named Mayor of Eatonville. Joe strives for equality with white men, particularly the mayor of the white town across the river from Eatonville. To attain this status he requires nice things: the largest white house, a nice desk and chair, a gilded spitoon, and a beautiful wife. He is a larger-than-life character and during their time in Eatonville, he has grown an equally large belly and taken up the habit of chewing nice cigars, both of which cement his status with the locals as an important man around town. Joe, like most of the men in the book, believes that women are incapable of thinking and caring for themselves. He likens them to children and livestock that need constant tending and direction. &quot;Somebody&#x27;s got to think for the women and chillen and chickens and cows. God, they sho don&#x27;t think none fo themselves.&quot;

Jody is a jealous man, and because of this he grows more and more possessive and controlling of Janie. He expects her to dress a certain way (buying her the finest of clothes, with tight corsets) and requires that she wear her long, beautiful hair—symbolic of her free spirit and femininity—covered and up in a bun, so as not to attract too much unwanted attention from the other men in Eatonville. He considers her long hair to be for his enjoyment alone. He excludes Janie from various events and the social gatherings in Eatonville to further his dominance and control over her. He restricts her from being friendly with the other townswomen, requiring her to behave in a separate and superior manner.

==== Vergible &quot;Tea Cake&quot; Woods ====

Tea Cake is Janie&#x27;s third and final husband. He is her ideal partner in her search for true love. He is charismatic, charming, sharp-witted, and creative with a penchant for embellished stories. To Janie, he is larger than life, wise, and genuinely caring. Tea Cake is loving towards Janie and respectful of her as an autonomous individual. Unlike in her previous two marriages, Tea Cake never stops trying to make Janie happy. He is more than willing to share with her what he has learned from his own experiences and show her the greater world outside of her own existence. He enjoys being with Janie and playing the role of a teacher. Through Tea Cake, Janie learns to shoot a rifle, play checkers, fish, and hunt alligator, among other activities.

However, Tea Cake shows tendencies of patriarchal dominance and psychological abuse towards Janie, somewhat like in her previous two marriages. He isn&#x27;t always truthful with her—in a show of male dominance in their relationship, Tea Cake takes $200 from Janie without her knowledge or permission and spends it on a guitar and a lavish party with others around town without including her in the festivities. While accounting for his spending of her money, he tells Janie that he had to pay women that he deemed unattractive $2 each to keep them from the party. He then gambles the remaining amount to make the money back, telling her to put it in the bank and to only rely off of him and whatever money he could make. What differentiates Tea Cake from Joe in this regard is that Janie regularly confronts him and he acquiesces to her demand that she not be excluded from aspects of his life.

Another tendency that Tea Cake shares with Joe is his jealousy and need to maintain some amount of control over Janie. When he overhears another woman, Mrs. Turner, speaking poorly to Janie about Tea Cake and attempting to set her up with her brother, Tea Cake decides to take matters into his own hands. He initially discusses it with Janie, but when Mrs. Turner&#x27;s brother actually comes to town, he slaps his wife around in front of Mrs. Turner and others to show them that he is in charge and to assert his ownership over her. He ends up successfully executing an elaborate plan to ruin her establishment.

In the end, Tea Cake plays the role of hero to Janie when he saves her from drowning and being attacked by a rabid dog. Tea Cake himself is bitten and eventually succumbs to the disease. Not able to think rationally and enraged with jealousy, he physically attacks Janie, who is forced to shoot and kill Tea Cake.

=== Liberated woman ===
Janie is constantly searching for her own voice and identity throughout the novel. She is often without a voice in relation to her husbands as she will not fight back. Janie also encounters situations that make her feel that her value as an African-American woman is little to none. She is seen as distinct from other women in the novel, who follow traditions and do not find a life independent of men. Janie&#x27;s physical appeal becomes a basis for Starks and Tea Cake to have jealousy and belittle her looks. Starks orders Janie to cover her long hair as other men are attracted to it. Similarly, Tea Cake remarks on Janie&#x27;s lighter skin and her appeal to Mrs. Turner&#x27;s brother. But Janie begins to feel liberated in her marriage with Tea Cake because he treats her as an equal and mostly does not look down on her. As a result, she loves him more than she did her other two spouses.

Janie does not find complete independence as a woman until after Tea Cake&#x27;s death. She returns to Eatonville with her hair down and she sits on her own porch chatting with her friend Pheoby. By the end of the novel, she has overcome traditional roles and cultivates an image of the &quot;liberated black woman.&quot;

==== Liberation from racial history ====
Janie grew up under the care of her grandmother, Nanny. Nanny&#x27;s experiences as a slave and freedwoman shaped the way Nanny saw the world. She hoped to protect Janie, by forcing her to marry Logan Killicks, although he was older and not attractive. Janie followed her grandmother&#x27;s advice but found that it wouldn&#x27;t be as easy to love him as Nanny had suggested. African Americans believed in marriage during the early 20th century because they had been prevented from such legal protection under slavery. Unhappy in her marriage to Logan, Janie runs off with Starks and commits bigamy. After the death of Starks, Janie meets Tea Cake and they fall in love. Her community thought he was a broke nobody and were suspicious of him. Tea Cake wasn&#x27;t the perfect man, but he was better than the community of Eatonville had expected him to be.

==== Liberation from domestic violence ====
During the early 20th century, the African-American community asked African-American women to set aside self-realization and self-affirmation values. They imposed male-dominated values and often controlled who women married. Janie suffered domestic violence in her marriages with Joe Starks and Tea Cake. Starks initially seemed to be good for Janie, but later beat her several times, in an effort to exert his authority over her. Despite her husband&#x27;s physical and emotional abuse, Janie did not complain, behavior that was approved by the townsmen. Domestic abuse was not entirely disapproved by the African-American community, and men thought it was acceptable to control their women this way. After Starks&#x27; death, Janie was freed from his abuse. Tea Cake was kinder to her and respected her, but he was occasionally abusive toward her, such as when he beat her in order to show his dominance when another man seemed to make a pass at Janie. As a result, it is only after Tea Cake&#x27;s death that she is fully liberated from the threat of domestic violence.

==== Liberation from sexual norms ====
The early 1900s was a time in which patriarchal ideals were accepted and seen as the norm. Throughout the novel, Janie on multiple occasions suffers from these ideals. In her relationships, she is being ordered around by the man, but she did not question it, whether in the kitchen or bedroom. Janie in many ways expresses her growing distance from the sexual and social norms of her time. After the death of Starks, Janie goes to his funeral wearing black and formal clothes. But for Tea Cake&#x27;s funeral, she wears workers&#x27; blue overalls, showing that she cared less for what society thought of her as she got older. In addition, critics say that Tea Cake was the vehicle for Janie&#x27;s liberation. She went from working in the kitchen and indoors to working more &quot;manly&quot; jobs, such as helping in the fields, fishing, and hunting. Tea Cake offered her a partnership; he didn&#x27;t see her as an object to be controlled and possessed through marriage.

=== Value of women in a relationship ===
Throughout the novel, Hurston vividly displays how African American women are valued, or devalued, in their marital relationships. By doing so, she takes the reader on a journey through Janie&#x27;s life and her marriages. Janie formed her initial idea of marriage off the beautiful image of unity she witnessed between a pear tree and a bee. This image and expectation sets Janie up for disappointment when it came time to marry. From her marriage to Logan Killicks to Tea Cake, Janie was forced to acknowledge where she stood as a powerless female in her relationship.

Starting with her marriage to Logan, Janie was put in a place where she was expected to prove her value with hard work. On top of all the physical labor expected from her, Janie endured constant insults and physical beatings from her male counterparts. Hoping for more value, Janie decides to leave Logan and run off with Joe Starks. However, in reaction to this decision, she&#x27;s only faced with more beating and devaluement. Joe expected her stay in the home, work in the kitchen, and when she was in public, Janie was expected to cover her hair and avoid conversation with the locals. With one last hope, Janie engaged in a marriage with Tea Cake, a younger man, and things finally seemed to look up for her, even though she was still expected to help in the fields and tend to her womanly duties. Overall, throughout her marriages, Janie experienced the hardships that most African American women went through at that time. From the physical labor to the physical beatings, Janie was presented with the life that a woman was expected to live. [See detailed argument and synopsis in Addison Gayle, Jr.&#x27;s article, &quot;The Outsider&quot;]

Janie was able to feel like a woman in her third marriage with Tea Cake. In her first marriage with Logan she was being controlled by her husband. She didn&#x27;t feel like a woman in her first marriage. She didn&#x27;t feel any love or affection either. In her second marriage with Jody, she was able to experience independence as a woman. With Jody&#x27;s death, she became in charge of the store and his property. She was able to experience freedom and an economic stable life. She learned about ownership, self-determination, self ruling, and home ruling. In her last marriage with Tea Cake Janie experienced true love. But she also learned who she was as an African American woman. Throughout her marriages she learned how to value herself as a woman, an African American woman, and a hard working woman.

The novel is written in dialect and colloquial language that expresses it as a story of a black woman from Southern United States. Throughout the novel, Janie serves both as protagonist as well as occasional narrator, detailing the events of her life, her three marriages, and the aftermath of each, that eventually lead to her return to Eatonville. This is done with two contrasting writing styles, one in standard English prose when the narration is done in third person, and the other making use of black Southern vernacular in dialogue. The theme of having a voice and being able to speak out is a prevalent theme throughout the novel. During her first two marriages to Logan Killicks and Joe Starks, Janie is subjugated and held under their rule, the former comparing her to another mule to work his field and the latter keeping her in a powerless position of domesticity. Throughout both marriages she finds herself without the ability to speak out or to express herself, and when she tries she is usually shut down. This leaves her feeling like a &quot;rut in the road,&quot; the isolation taking its toll until she finally confronts Joe and attacks his ego with a verbal assault against his manhood. The effect this takes is that it leaves Joe resenting Janie and in effect destroys what is left of their marriage. When Janie marries Tea Cake, we see how language affects the way Janie begins to feel about herself. The way Tea Cake speaks to her allows her to find the freedom in her own voice and to begin to learn how to use it. We are able to see how language helps Janie grow as a person once she learns that her voice is her power.

=== Race ===
While the novel is written about Black people in the South, it is not primarily a book about a racist society. Nanny is the first character to discuss the effects of slavery. &quot;Ah was born back due in slavery so it wasn&#x27;t for me to fulfil my dreams of whut a woman oughta be and to do. Dat&#x27;s one of de hold-backs of slavery.&quot; The novel is mostly concerned with differences within the black community. Starks is compared to the master of a plantation, as he has a huge house in the centre of the town. &quot;The rest of town looked like servants&#x27; quarters surrounding the &#x27;big house&#x27;. Starks becomes a figure of authority because he has money and is determined to create the first black town. But his plans seem to result in a town where people impose their own hierarchy. &quot;Us talks about de white man keepin&#x27; us down! Shucks! He don&#x27;t have tuh. Us keeps our own selves down.&quot; When Janie marries Tea Cake and moves to the Everglades, she becomes friendly with Mrs. Turner. This woman compliments Janie on her light skin and European features, from her mixed-race ancestry. Turner disapproves of her marriage to Tea Cake, as he is darker skinned and more &quot;African&quot; looking. 

==Inspirations and influences==
Perhaps the strongest inspiration for Hurston&#x27;s writing of &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; was her former lover Percival Punter. Hurston writes in her autobiography that the romance between Janie and Tea Cake was inspired by a tumultuous love affair. She described falling in love with the man as &quot;a parachute jump&quot;. Like Janie in the novel, Hurston was significantly older than her lover. Like Jody, Punter was sexually dominant and sometimes violent. Hurston wrote &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; three weeks after the tumultuous conclusion of her relationship with Punter. She wrote in her autobiography that she had &quot;tried to embalm all the tenderness of [her] passion for him.&quot; With this emotional inspiration, Hurston went on to paint the picture of &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; using her personal experience and research as a template.

In 1927, a decade before writing &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;, Hurston traveled south to collect folk songs and folk tales through an anthropological research fellowship arranged by her Barnard College mentor Franz Boas. The all-black Eatonville of &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; is based on the all-black town of the same name in which Hurston grew up. The town&#x27;s weekly announced in 1889, &quot;Colored People of the United States: Solve the great race problem by securing a home in Eatonville, Florida, a Negro city governed by negroes.&quot; The hurricane that symbolizes the climax of Hurston&#x27;s story also has an historical inspiration; in 1928, &quot;a hurricane ravaged both coastal and inland areas of Florida, bringing torrential rains that broke the dikes of Lake Okeechobee near Belle Glade&quot;. Scholars of the African diaspora note the cultural practices common to the Caribbean, Africa, and the United States in &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;.

Hurston wrote &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; while living in Belle Glade, at the home of Harvey Poole, who, as manager of one of the local labor camps, informed her tremendously about bean picking, and the labors of African-Americans on the muckland. The book was also written while on a Guggenheim Fellowship in Haiti to research Obeah practices in the West Indies.

==Reception==

===Initial reception===
Hurston&#x27;s political views in &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; were met with resistance from several leading Harlem Renaissance authors.

Novelist and essayist Richard Wright condemned &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;, writing in a review for &quot;New Masses&quot; (1937):

Miss Hurston seems to have no desire whatsoever to move in the direction of serious fiction… [She] can write; but her prose is cloaked in that facile sensuality that has dogged Negro expression since the days of Phyllis Wheatley... Her characters eat and laugh and cry and work and kill; they swing like a pendulum eternally in that safe and narrow orbit in which America likes to see the Negro live: between laughter and tears.
Ralph Ellison said the book contained a &quot;blight of calculated burlesque.&quot;

Alain Locke wrote in a review: &quot;when will the Negro novelist of maturity, who knows how to tell a story convincingly—which is Miss Hurston&#x27;s cradle gift, come to grips with motive fiction and social document fiction?&quot;

&quot;The New Republic&quot;″s Otis Ferguson wrote: &quot;it isn&#x27;t that this novel is bad, but that it deserves to be better&quot;. But he went on to praise the work for depicting &quot;Negro life in its naturally creative and unselfconscious grace&quot;.

Not all African-American critics had negative things to say about Hurston&#x27;s work. Carter G. Woodson, founder of &quot;The Journal of Negro History&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; is a gripping story... the author deserves great praise for the skill and effectiveness shown in the writing of this book.&quot; The critic noted Hurston&#x27;s anthropological approach to writing, &quot;She studied them until she thoroughly understood the working of their minds, learned to speak their language&quot;.

Meanwhile, reviews of Hurston&#x27;s book in the mainstream white press were largely positive, although they did not translate into significant retail sales. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ralph Thompson states:[T]he normal life of Negroes in the South today—the life with its holdovers from slave times, its social difficulties, childish excitements, and endless exuberances... compared to this sort of story, the ordinary narratives of Negroes in Harlem or Birmingham seem ordinary indeed.&quot;

For the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, Sheila Hibben described Hurston as writing &quot;with her head as with her heart&quot; creating a &quot;warm, vibrant touch&quot;. She praised &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; as filled with &quot;a flashing, gleaming riot of black people, with a limitless sense of humor, and a wild, strange sadness&quot;.

&quot;New York Times&quot; critic Lucille Tompkins described &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;, thus: &quot;It is about Negroes... but really it is about every one, or at least every one who isn&#x27;t so civilized that he has lost the capacity for glory.&quot;

===Rediscovery===
As universities across the country developed Black Studies programs in the 1970s and 1980s, they created greater space for Black literature in academia. Several prominent academics, including Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Addison Gayle, Jr., established a new &quot;Black Aesthetic&quot; that &quot;placed the sources of contemporary black literature and culture in the communal music and oral folk tradition&quot;. This new respect coupled with a growing Black feminism led by Mary Helen Washington, Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, and others, would create the space for the rediscovery of Hurston.

Hurston first achieved a level of mainstream institutional support in the 1970s. Walker published an essay, &quot;Looking for Zora&quot;, in &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine in 1975. In that work, she described how the Black community&#x27;s general rejection of Hurston was like &quot;throwing away a genius&quot;. The National Endowment for the Humanities went on to award Robert Hemenway two grants for his work to write Hurston&#x27;s biography. The 1977 biography was followed in 1978 by the re-issue of &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;.

In 1975, the Modern Language Association held a special seminar focusing on Hurston. In 1981, professor Ruth Sheffey of Baltimore&#x27;s Morgan State University founded the Zora Neale Hurston Society. Hurston had attended the school, then known as Morgan Academy, in 1917.

In 1978, Harper and Row leased its rights to &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; to the University of Illinois Press. However, the printing was so profitable that Harper and Row refused to renew the leasing contract and instead reprinted its own new edition. This new edition sold its total print of 75,000 in less than a month.

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Virginia Heffernan explains that the book&#x27;s &quot;narrative technique, which is heavy on free-indirect discourse, lent itself to poststructuralist analysis&quot;. With so many new disciplines especially open to the themes and content of Hurston&#x27;s work, &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; achieved growing prominence in the last several decades. It is now firmly established in the literary canon.

On November 5, 2019, the &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

==Critical analysis==
*In Maria J. Johnson&#x27;s article &quot;&#x27;The World in a Jug and the Stopper in [Her] Hand&#x27;: &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; as Blues Performance&quot;, she states that Hurston&#x27;s novel takes a similar structure and aesthetic to blues culture. Johnson also shows how the contrast of Hurston&#x27;s images, such as the pleasure and pain dynamic of the bee, can be seen in songs by singers like Bessie Smith.
*The article &quot;The Cognitive Construction of the Self in Hurston&#x27;s &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;&quot;, by Patrick S. Bernard, highlights the connection between the construction of self and cognition in Hurston&#x27;s novel. According to Bernard, cognition is the inner essence of an individual that embodies the idea of &quot;thinking, seeing, speaking, and knowing&quot;, but is often determined by one&#x27;s exterior environment. Janie, the protagonist, uses her cognitive skills to find her identity and throughout the novel develops her cognition further. While Janie is living in a sexist society, she continues to rise above her opposition, specifically that of her three husbands. Bernard demonstrates that:

In a conversation with Jody, Janie defends &#x27;womenfolk,&#x27; disagreeing with the sexist claim that God made men &quot;different&quot; because they turn &quot;out so smart&quot; (70). When she states that men &quot;don&#x27;t know half as much as you think you do,&quot; Jody interrupts her saying, &#x27;you getting too moufy Janie... Go fetch me de checker-board and de checkers&#x27; (70–71) so that he and the other men could play (Bernard 9).

:The comment from Jody, Janie&#x27;s second husband, attempts to suppress her voice and manipulate her thoughts. Rather than acting submissive to Jody, Janie for a brief moment contends with Jody by telling him how men misunderstand women. Jody fears that Janie&#x27;s thinking will lead to her gaining more knowledge and naturally to speaking her mind, eventually leading to Janie achieving the power of knowledge to recognize and change the mistreatment and unfairness she has been receiving. Bernard proposes the idea that Jody&#x27;s relationship with Janie represents society&#x27;s assumption that women are of limited cognition. This assumption positions women in subservient roles that limit their ways of thinking, speaking, and seeing.

:In addition to bringing up Janie&#x27;s relationship with Jody, Bernard emphasizes how her relationships with her other husbands influenced her cognition. He points out the fact that Logan Killicks, Janie&#x27;s first husband, mistreated her by severing any beginning form of self-construction by treating her as an infant. Bernard also brings forth the idea that Janie&#x27;s construction of selfhood blossoms when Tea Cake, her third husband, allows her to participate in experiences unimaginable to her. While Logan Killicks gives her no opportunity of expressing herself, Jody overpowers her expressive voice; Tea Cake allows her construction of self to mature link between self construction and cognition. Bernard&#x27;s main point therefore is that self-construction is influenced by cognition, that is, knowing, thinking, seeing and speaking are important to the construction of self in Zora Neale Hurston&#x27;s novel.

*In &quot;The Hierarchy Itself: Hurston&#x27;s &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; and the Sacrifice of Narrative Authority,&quot; Ryan Simmons argues that Hurston made a statement against models of authority that supplant an oppressive system with other oppressive systems and offered an alternative. By models of authority, he means the narrative voice of the author and Janie&#x27;s narrative voice. Hurston represented the different ideologies of Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Du Bois through the characters of Logan Killicks and Joe (&quot;Jody&quot;) Starks. Like Washington, Logan models the path of &quot;gradual progress&quot; that would not threaten the white-dominated sphere of power and Hurston presents his practices as a tradeoff between liberty and modest prosperity. Joe models the path advocated by Du Bois, which is one of assertion of dignity and less compromise. However, the issue shown by Joe&#x27;s eventual isolation from the community dialogue he helped establish and Janie&#x27;s overpowering of him through a usurpation of authority, Hurston shows that the weakness with Joe&#x27;s approach is that it mirrors that of white suppression.

:Instead, Hurston introduces a third way of achieving self-autonomy through Tea Cake. He represents an independence from reliance on communal validation, and instead serves as a mirror for Janie to discover her narrative power. In relation to the author&#x27;s narrative power, Tea Cake is the epitome of a good reader, one that is receptive to the transformative message of the text. Language is the understanding and sharpening of one&#x27;s identity while communication comes second. In Hurston&#x27;s innovative narrative, she is attempting to fulfill the &quot;ideal narrative&quot;, which is one that nurtures and changes both the reader and the author.
*In the article &quot;&#x27;The Kiss of Memory&#x27;: The Problem of Love in Hurston&#x27;s Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;, author Tracy L. Bealer argues that Janie&#x27;s quest for her ideal form of love, as symbolized by the pear tree in bloom, is impossible within her existing sociohistorical environment. The forces of racial and patriarchal hierarchies lead Tea Cake, who generally treats Janie as his intellectual and communal equal, to beat her in order to display his dominance to their peers. Bealer asserts that the novel&#x27;s depiction of Tea Cake, abuse and all, is intentionally ambivalent in order to simultaneously promote intersubjective love and to indict racism and sexism.
*William M. Ramsey, in his article &quot;The compelling ambivalence of Zora Neale Hurston&#x27;s Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;, posits that the novel stands as an unfinished and unrealized work. He backs this claim by noting the short amount of time Hurston spent writing as well as statements made by Hurston in her autobiography. Ramsey also note how the numerous contradictions inherent in the novel (Tea Cake&#x27;s treatment of Janie, Janie&#x27;s idealization of Tea Cake, Janie&#x27;s expectations of a utopian &quot;pear tree&quot; marriage, etc.) have led to wildly different interpretations and ultimately, a richly ambivalent text.

:He also suggests that Tea Cake&#x27;s death is &quot;Hurston&#x27;s vicarious revenge on Arthur Price&quot;, a former lover that Hurston left to pursue a research fellowship in the Caribbean.

*In the article &quot;Naming and Power in Zora Neale Hurston&#x27;s Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;, Sigrid King comments that &quot;Naming has always been an important issue in the Afro-American tradition because of its link to the exercise of power.&quot; Their names are a form of power. King also says that &quot;Nanny teaches Janie the same lessons she learned about naming: Names are bound within the white male power structure, and the most a black woman can hope for is to endure within them&quot;. Nanny tells Janie that names are powerful and are used to take power away from people, and in the book, we see that Nanny&#x27;s name is her role in society and not an actual name. Hurston is aware of the power that names have and she chooses to have Janie start off the book without having a name.
*In the article &quot;Racial and sexual politics of Their Eyes are Watching God from a spatial perspective&quot;, Lihua Zhao argues that Janie is a victim of racism and gender sexism which leads to her poor character attributes in a lead black female novel. Zhao comments on the novel saying &quot;Janie&#x27;s determined and consistent ignorance of racial spatial division implies her weak black identification, the horrible damage done by racism. Her vague and brief feminist consciousness suggests the brainwash of patriarchy is so successful that it is very hard to eliminate.&quot; Zhao states that in order to bring attention to a social political issue, we must first expose the problem in a meaningful manner like how Hurston has in her novel.
*In the article &quot;Mules and women: identify and rebel—Janie&#x27;s identity quest in ″&quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;, Hongzhi Wu explores the symbolism of the mule in Hurston&#x27;s novel claiming that it provides a deeper meaning of the external issues of racism. Wu states: &quot;In all these animal talks they expressed their hatred of the abuses and exploitation from the white world; their despise of their white master&#x27;s ignorance and viciousness; their acclamation of the black people&#x27;s industriousness and intelligence; and they also expressed their hope of salvation.&quot; The mule acts as a metaphor for the exploitation and mistreatment of the black community by the white superiority race.

==Adaptations for theater, film and radio==
*In 1983, the graduate repertory Hilberry Theater at Wayne State University produced &quot;To Gleam It Around, To Show My Shine,&quot; which is based on &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;. The play was written by Bonnie Lee Moss Rattner and directed by Von Washington. It has been produced numerous times by other companies.
*Oprah Winfrey served as executive producer of the made-for-TV adaptation &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; in 2005. Harpo Productions sponsored the film, directed by Darnell Martin and with a screenplay written by Suzan-Lori Parks, Misan Sagay and Bobby Smith, Jr.
*In 2011, the novel was adapted as a radio play for BBC World Drama, dramatized by Patricia Cumper. The play first aired on February 19, 2011. 
*In 2012, a live radio play performance of &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;, written by Arthur Yorinks, was recorded and broadcast to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the book&#x27;s publication.

<doc id="244664" wikidata="Q1129589" url="?curid=244664" title="Rip Van Winkle">
<text>&quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; () is a short story by the American author Washington Irving, first published in 1819. It follows a Dutch-American villager in colonial America named Rip Van Winkle who meets mysterious Dutchmen, imbibes their strong liquor and falls deeply asleep in the Catskill Mountains. He awakes 20 years later to a very changed world, having missed the American Revolution. 

Inspired by a conversation on nostalgia with his American expatriate brother-in-law, Irving wrote the story while temporarily living in Birmingham, England. It was published in his collection, &quot;The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.&quot; While the story is set in New York&#x27;s Catskill Mountains near where Irving later took up residence, he admitted, &quot;When I wrote the story, I had never been on the Catskills.&quot;

The Mountain Top Historical Society in Haines Falls, New York, has hosted a community reading of the story every year since 2019. The Mountain Top Historical Society is located at the top of Kaaterskill Clove in New York&#x27;s Catskill Mountains, where the story is set.

== Plot ==
Rip Van Winkle, a Dutch American man with a habit of avoiding useful work, lives in a village at the foot of the Kaatskill Mountains in the years before the American Revolution. One day, he goes squirrel hunting in the mountains with his dog, Wolf, to escape his wife&#x27;s irritation. As evening falls, he hears a voice calling his name and finds a man dressed in old-fashioned Dutch clothing and carrying a keg. Rip helps the man carry his burden to a cleft in the rocks from which thunderous noises are emanating; the source proves to be a group of bearded men wearing similar outfits playing nine-pin bowling. Not asking who these men are or how they know his name, Rip joins them in drink bottles of alcohol from the keg he has helped carry and soon becomes so silly that he falls asleep. 

Rip awakens on a sunny morning, at the spot where he first saw the keg-carrier, and finds that many drastic changes have occurred; his beard is a foot long and has turned grey, his musket is badly deteriorated, and Wolf is nowhere to be found. Returning to his village, he discovers it to be larger than he remembers and filled with people in unfamiliar clothing, none of whom recognize him. When asked how he voted in the election that has just been held, he declares himself a loyal subject of George III, unaware that the American Revolutionary War has taken place in his absence. He learns that many of his old friends either were killed in the war or have left the village and is disturbed to find a young man who shares his name, mannerisms, and younger appearance. A young woman states that her father is Rip Van Winkle, who has been missing for 21 years, and an old woman recognises him as Rip. The young woman and the young Rip are his children, and the former has named her infant son after him as well. 

Rip discovers that his wife has been dead for some time but is not saddened by the news. He learns via a village elder that the men he met in the mountains are told to be ghosts of the crew of the Dutch East India Company ship &quot;Halve Maen&quot;. His daughter takes him into her home, and he soon resumes his usual idleness (unconcerned by the major political changes during his slumber) and begins telling his story to every stranger who visits the village. The tale is solemnly taken to heart (despite some assuming him to be insane) by the settlers, particularly by the old Dutch inhabitants who say that, whenever thunder is heard, the men in the mountains must be playing ninepins.

==Composition and publication history==

After a failed business venture with his brothers, Irving filed for bankruptcy in 1818. Despondent, he turned to writing for possible financial support, although he had difficulty thinking of stories to write. He stayed in Birmingham, England, where his brother-in-law Henry van Wart had opened a trading firm. The two were reminiscing in June 1818 when Irving was suddenly inspired by their nostalgic conversation. Irving locked himself in his room and wrote nonstop all night. As he said, he felt like a man waking from a long sleep. He presented the first draft of &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; to the van Wart family over breakfast.

&quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; was one of the first stories Irving proposed for his new book &quot;The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.&quot; Irving asked his brother Ebenezer to assist with publication in the United States. As Irving wrote, &quot;I shall feel very anxious to hear of the success of this first re-appearance on the literary stage – Should it be successful, I trust I shall be able henceforth to keep up an occasional fire.&quot; A British edition was published shortly afterward, by John Miller, who went out of business immediately thereafter. With help from his friend Walter Scott, Irving was able to convince John Murray to take over British publication of the &quot;Sketch Book&quot;.

Following the success of &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; in print and onstage, later celebrated editions were illustrated by Arthur Rackham (Heinemann, 1905) and N.C. Wyeth (McKay, 1921).

==Themes and literary forerunners==

The story of &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; itself is widely thought to have been based on Johann Karl Christoph Nachtigal&#x27;s German folktale &quot;Peter Klaus&quot;, which is a shorter story set in a German village. It tells of a goatherd named Peter Klaus who goes looking for a lost goat. He finds some men drinking in the woods and after drinking some of their wine, falls asleep. When he wakes up, twenty years have passed.

The story also bears some similarities to stories from East Asia, including the third-century AD Chinese tale of &quot;Ranka&quot;, as retold by Lionel Giles in &quot;A Gallery of Chinese Immortals&quot;, and the eighth-century Japanese tale &quot;Urashima Tarō&quot;. The Hindu story of Muchukunda from the &quot;Bhagavatam&quot; also displays many similarities to the story of &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot;.

In Christian tradition, there is a similar, well-known story of &quot;The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus&quot;, which recounts a group of early Christians who hid in a cave circa 250 AD to escape the persecution of Christians during the reign of the Roman emperor Decius. They fell into a miraculous sleep and woke some 200 years later during the reign of Theodosius II to discover that the city and the whole Empire had become Christian. This Christian story is recounted by Islam and appears in a famous Sura of the Quran, Sura Al-Kahf. The version recalls a group of young monotheists escaping from persecution within a cave and emerging hundreds of years later.

One story in Judaism concerns Honi HaMe&#x27;agel, a miracle-working sage of the 1st century BC, who was a historical character but to whom various myths were attached. While traveling one day, Honi saw a man planting a carob tree and asked him about it. The man explained that the tree would take 70 years to bear fruit and that he was planting it not for himself but for the generations to follow him. Later that day, Honi sat down to rest but fell asleep for 70 years; when he awoke, he saw a man picking fruit from a fully mature carob tree. Asked whether he had planted it, the man replied that he had not but that his grandfather had planted it for him.

Another similar story in the Islamic tradition is of Uzair (usually identified with the Biblical Ezra), whose grief at the Destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians was so great that God took his soul and brought him back to life after Jerusalem was reconstructed. He rode on his revived donkey and entered his native place. But the people did not recognize him, nor did his household, except the maid, who was now an old blind woman. He prayed to God to cure her blindness, and she could see again. He meets his son, who recognizes him by a mole between his shoulders and is older than he was. (see Uzair#Islamic tradition and literature).

Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity, under which a person traveling at near light speed would experience only the passage of a few years but would return to find centuries had passed on Earth, provides a broad new scope to express essentially the same literary theme – for example, in the opening chapter of Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot;. In Robert Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Time for the Stars&quot;, Earth sends out a fleet of relativistic ships to explore the galaxy, their crews hailed as stalwart pioneers – but after a century, which they experience as only a few years, faster-than-light ships are developed and the earlier ones are recalled, their crews discovering that they had become unwanted anachronisms on a changed Earth. The protagonist notices a newspaper headline disparagingly announcing the arrival of himself and his shipmates as &quot;yet another crew of Rip Van Winkles&quot;. 

In the tenth chapter of his book &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;, the third-century AD Greek historian Diogenes Laërtius relates the story of the legendary sage Epimenides of Knossos, who was said to have been a shepherd on the island of Crete. One day, Epimenides followed after a sheep that had wandered off and after becoming tired, went into a cave under Mount Ida and fell asleep. When he awoke, he continued searching for the sheep but could not find it, so he returned to his father&#x27;s farm, only to discover that it was under new ownership. He went home, only to discover that the people there did not know him. Finally, he encountered his younger brother, who had become an old man, and learned that he had been asleep in the cave for fifty-seven years. According to the different sources that Diogenes relates, Epimenides lived to be 154, 157, or 299 years old. Multiple sources have identified the story of Epimenides as the earliest known variant of the &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; fairy tale.

The theme is taken up in numerous modern works of science fiction. In H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Sleeper Awakes&quot;, a man who sleeps for 203 years wakes up in a completely transformed London, where he has become the richest man in the world. In the original Buck Rogers book, the protagonist falls asleep under the influence of a gas in a mine, sleeps for four centuries, and wakes to find America under the rule of Mongol invaders – whereupon he places himself at the head of the freedom fighters. In Roger Zelazny&#x27;s science-fantasy series &quot;The Chronicles of Amber&quot;, protagonist Corwyn experiences drinking and revelry in an underground lair with otherworldly people who try to entice him into slumber; he knows this is a centuries-of-sleep trap and resists; the passage is similar in theme to both &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; and especially the Orkney story.

** American Doo-wop band The Devotions released their novelty single &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; in 1961 on Delta Records.
** American psych-rock band Shannon and the Clams released a song called &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; on their third album, &quot;Dreams from the Rat House&quot;.
** American alternative rock band Ween mentions Rip Van Winkle in numerous songs on their 1991 album &quot;The Pod&quot;, most notably the song &quot;Sketches of Winkle&quot;.
* Video games: 
**The 1990 video game &quot;Super Mario World&quot; features an enemy known as &quot;Rip Van Fish&quot;, which constantly sleeps unless disturbed.
**In the 2018 video game, Red Dead Redemption 2, one of the characters (John Marston) uses the name &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; when questioned by the authorities
* Television: 
** In the 1961 &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;The Rip Van Winkle Caper&quot;, four gold thieves place themselves in suspended animation for 100 years in order to escape the law. Upon revival, they find one of them already dead. Two others die later, and the last man dies of thirst, offering his gold to a citizen in exchange for water. But he doesn&#x27;t realize that, in the intervening years, gold became possible to manufacture and became practically worthless.
** On the BBC television show &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the tenth episode of the ninth series (titled &quot;Sleep No More&quot;) involves a machine called Morpheus that can condense a full night&#x27;s worth of sleep into mere minutes. People who refuse to use Morpheus are colloquially called &quot;Rips&quot;, referencing Rip van Winkle.

<doc id="244665" wikidata="Q16718297" url="?curid=244665" title="Tiger beetle">
<text>Tiger beetles are a family of beetles, Cicindelidae, known for their aggressive predatory habits and running speed. The fastest known species of tiger beetle, &quot;Rivacindela hudsoni&quot;, can run at a speed of , or about 125 body lengths per second. As of 2005, about 2,600 species and subspecies were known, with the richest diversity in the Oriental (Indo-Malayan) region, followed by the Neotropics. While historically treated as a subfamily of ground beetles (Carabidae) under the name Cicindelinae, several studies since 2020 indicated that they should be treated as a family, the Cicindelidae, which are a sister group to Carabidae within the Adephaga.

==Description==
Tiger beetles often have large bulging eyes, long, slender legs and large curved mandibles. All are predatory, both as adults and as larvae. The genus &quot;Cicindela&quot; has a cosmopolitan distribution. Other well-known genera include &quot;Tetracha&quot;, &quot;Omus&quot;, &quot;Amblycheila&quot; and &quot;Manticora&quot;. While members of the genus &quot;Cicindela&quot; are usually diurnal and may be out on the hottest days, &quot;Tetracha&quot;, &quot;Omus&quot;, &quot;Amblycheila&quot; and &quot;Manticora&quot; are all nocturnal. Both &quot;Cicindela&quot; and &quot;Tetracha&quot; are often brightly colored, while the other genera mentioned are usually uniform black in color. Tiger beetles in the genus &quot;Manticora&quot; are the largest in size of the family. These live primarily in the dry regions of southern Africa.

The larvae of tiger beetles live in cylindrical burrows as much as a meter deep.
The grubs have a large head, armored on top with up to six small eyes and formidable mandibles beneath.
There is a prominent hump on the top of their fifth abdominal segment with two pairs of reverse pointing hooks to anchor then in their burrow with their head filling the burrow and flush with the surface. They wait for prey to come too close, attempt to grab and pull them down their shaft. The hump and hooks prevent struggling prey from pulling them out of their shaft.
The fast-moving adults run down their prey and are extremely fast on the wing, their reaction times being of the same order as that of common houseflies.
Some tiger beetles in the tropics are arboreal, but most run on the surface of the ground. They live along sea and lake shores, on sand dunes, around playa lakebeds and on clay banks or woodland paths, being particularly fond of sandy surfaces.
Tiger beetles are considered a good indicator species and have been used in ecological studies on biodiversity. Several species of wingless parasitic wasps in the genus &quot;Methocha&quot; (family Thynnidae), lay their eggs on larvae of various &quot;Cicindela&quot; spp., such as &quot;Cicindela dorsalis&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Tiger beetles display an unusual form of pursuit in which they alternatively sprint quickly toward their prey, then stop and visually reorient. This may be because while running, the beetle is moving too fast for its visual system to accurately process images. To avoid obstacles while running they hold their antennae rigidly and directly in front of them to mechanically sense their environment. There are many tiger beetles that hunt in flat, sandy areas, and their eyes have flat-world adaptations, such as high-acuity perception streaks corresponding to the horizon. A tiger beetle uses the elevation of its potential prey in its visual field to determine how far away it is. As visual hunters, tiger beetles tend to hunt in open, relatively flat habitats, such as sand bars, woodland paths, and barren ground scrubland. In this sense, beetles might be expected to use elevation as a distance cue in their visual pursuit of prey. A few species of &quot;Cicindela&quot; have been found to be able to hunt without use of their eyes and several are crepuscular.

Several species have been found to be sensitive to ultrasound and also produce ultrasound in response to bats and are thought to be Batesian mimics, imitating the sounds of toxic moths that are avoided by bats.

==Fossil record==
The oldest fossil tiger beetle yet found, &quot;Cretotetracha grandis&quot;, comes from the Yixian Formation in Inner Mongolia, China, and dates to the early Cretaceous Period, 125 million years ago. Most fossils found are grey or yellow silty mudstone. Traits that identify &quot;Cretotetracha&quot; as Cicindelinae include long mandibles shaped like sickles, simple teeth arranged along the mandible&#x27;s inner surface, antennae that attach to the head between the base of the mandibles and the eye. The left mandible is approximately 3.3 mm and the right mandible is approximately 4.2mm long. A long body form roughly around 8.1mm where the combined eyes and head are wider than the thorax, and long running legs. Previously known Mesozoic fossils of tiger beetles have been described from the Crato Formation, about 113 million years ago and &quot;Oxycheilopsis cretacicus&quot; from the Santana Formation, 112 million years ago, both in Brazil.

==Taxonomy==
Tiger beetles had been treated either as a family Cicindelidae or as the subfamily Cicindelinae of the Carabidae (ground beetles) but since 2020, there has been growing evidence for the treatment as a separate family, that is sister to the Carabidae. Many genera are the result of the splitting of the large genus &quot;Cicindela&quot;, and many were described by the German entomologist Walther Horn.

<text>Frits Zernike (; 16 July 1888 – 10 March 1966) was a Dutch physicist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 for his invention of the phase-contrast microscope.

== Early life and education ==
Frederick &quot;Frits&quot; Zernike was born on 16 July 1888 in Amsterdam, Netherlands to Carl Friedrich August Zernike and Antje Dieperink. Both parents were teachers of mathematics, and he especially shared his father&#x27;s passion for physics. In 1905 he enrolled at the University of Amsterdam, studying chemistry (his major), mathematics and physics.

== Academic career ==
In 1912, he was awarded a prize for his work on opalescence in gases. In 1913, he became assistant to Jacobus Kapteyn at the astronomical laboratory of Groningen University. In 1914, Zernike and Leonard Ornstein were jointly responsible for the derivation of the Ornstein–Zernike equation in critical-point theory. In 1915, he became lector in theoretical mechanics and mathematical physics at the same university and in 1920 he was promoted to professor of mathematical physics.

In 1930, Zernike was conducting research into spectral lines when he discovered that the so-called &quot;ghost lines&quot; that occur to the left and right of each primary line in spectra created by means of a diffraction grating, have their phase shifted from that of the primary line by 90 degrees. It was at a Physical and Medical Congress in Wageningen in 1933, that Zernike first described his phase contrast technique in microscopy. He extended his method to test the figure of concave mirrors. His discovery lay at the base of the first phase contrast microscope, built during World War II.

He also made another contribution in the field of optics, relating to the efficient description of the imaging defects or aberrations of optical imaging systems like microscopes and telescopes. The representation of aberrations was originally based on the theory developed by Ludwig Seidel in the middle of the nineteenth century. Seidel&#x27;s representation was based on power series expansions and did not allow a clear separation between various types and orders of aberrations. Zernike&#x27;s orthogonal circle polynomials provided a solution to the long-standing problem of the optimum &#x27;balancing&#x27; of the various aberrations of an optical instrument. Since the 1960s, Zernike&#x27;s circle polynomials are widely used in optical design, optical metrology and image analysis.

Zernike&#x27;s work helped awaken interest in coherence theory, the study of partially coherent light sources. In 1938 he published a simpler derivation of Van Cittert&#x27;s 1934 theorem on the coherence of radiation from distant sources, now known as the Van Cittert–Zernike theorem.

== Death ==
He died in hospital in Amersfoort in 1966 after suffering illness the last years of his life. His granddaughter is journalist Kate Zernike.

== Honours and awards ==
In 1946, Zernike became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1953, Zernike won the Nobel Prize in Physics, for his invention of the phase-contrast microscope, an instrument that permits the study of internal cell structure without the need to stain and thus kill the cells.

In 1954, Zernike became an Honorary Member of The Optical Society (OSA). Zernike was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS).

The university complex (Zernike Campus) to the north of the city of Groningen is named after him, as is the crater Zernike on the Moon and the minor planet 11779 Zernike.

Zernike&#x27;s great-nephew Gerard &#x27;t Hooft won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1999.

The Oz Enterprise, a Linux distribution, was named after Leonard Ornstein and Frederik Zernike.

<doc id="244680" wikidata="Q3610518" url="?curid=244680" title="Multiple cropping">
<text>In agriculture, multiple cropping or multicropping is the practice of growing two or more crops in the same piece of land during one year, instead of just one crop. When multiple crops are grown simultaneously, this is also known as intercropping. This cropping system helps farmers to double their crop productivity and their income. But, the selection of two or more crops for practicing multicropping mainly depends on the mutual benefit of the selected crops. 

Threshing can be difficult in multiple cropping systems where crops are harvested together. It can take the form of double-cropping, in which a second crop is planted after the first has been harvested. In the Garhwal Himalaya of India, a practice called barahnaja involves sowing 12 or more crops on the same plot, including various types of beans, grains, and millets, and harvesting them at different times.

== Benefits of multiple cropping ==
Adopting the practice of multiple cropping on a large scale can help in reducing the food crises of a country. The overall cost of input decreases, cost spent on fertilizers, irrigation, labour, etc. reduces because of growing two or more than two crops on the same field. Risk of weed growth, pest and disease infestation reduces because of mutual relationship within the crop. This results in better farm management and increased income of the farmer. However, only 5% of global rainfed cropland is under multiple cropping, while 40% of global irrigated cropland is under multiple cropping.

In China, the land reform movement and collectivization of farming facilitated double-cropping in the south of the country, leading to a major increase in agricultural yields.

<doc id="244689" wikidata="Q1474542" url="?curid=244689" title="Higher-order function">
<text>In mathematics and computer science, a higher-order function (HOF) is a function that does at least one of the following:
* takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e. a procedural parameter, which is a parameter of a procedure that is itself a procedure),
* returns a function or value as its result.
All other functions are &quot;first-order functions&quot;. In mathematics higher-order functions are also termed &quot;operators&quot; or &quot;functionals&quot;. The differential operator in calculus is a common example, since it maps a function to its derivative, also a function. Higher-order functions should not be confused with other uses of the word &quot;functor&quot; throughout mathematics, see Functor (disambiguation).

In the untyped lambda calculus, all functions are higher-order; in a typed lambda calculus, from which most functional programming languages are derived, higher-order functions that take one function as argument are values with types of the form formula_1.

==General examples==
* codice_1 function, found in many functional programming languages, is one example of a higher-order function. It takes as arguments a function &quot;f&quot; and a collection of elements, and as the result, returns a new collection with &quot;f&quot; applied to each element from the collection.
* Sorting functions, which take a comparison function as a parameter, allowing the programmer to separate the sorting algorithm from the comparisons of the items being sorted. The C standard function codice_2 is an example of this.
* filter
* fold
* apply
* Function composition
* Integration
* Callback
* Tree traversal
* Montague grammar, a semantic theory of natural language, uses higher-order functions

==Support in programming languages==

===Direct support===
&quot;The examples are not intended to compare and contrast programming languages, but to serve as examples of higher-order function syntax&quot;

In the following examples, the higher-order function takes a function, and applies the function to some value twice. If has to be applied several times for the same it preferably should return a function rather than a value. This is in line with the &quot;don&#x27;t repeat yourself&quot; principle.

====APL====

 twice←{⍺⍺ ⍺⍺ ⍵}

 plusthree←{⍵+3}

 g←{plusthree twice ⍵}
 g 7
13
Or in a tacit manner:
 twice←⍣2

 plusthree←+∘3

 g←plusthree twice
 g 7
13
====C++====
Using in C++11:
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;functional&gt;

auto twice = [](const std::function&lt;int(int)&gt;&amp; f)
 return [f](int x) {
 return f(f(x));
};

auto plus_three = [](int i)
 return i + 3;

int main()
 auto g = twice(plus_three);

 std::cout « g(7) « &#x27;\n&#x27;; // 13


Or, with generic lambdas provided by C++14:
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

auto twice = [](const auto&amp; f)
 return [f](int x) {
 return f(f(x));
};

auto plus_three = [](int i)
 return i + 3;

int main()
 auto g = twice(plus_three);

 std::cout « g(7) « &#x27;\n&#x27;; // 13


====C#====
Using just delegates:
using System;

public class Program
 public static void Main(string[] args)
 Func&lt;Func&lt;int, int&gt;, Func&lt;int, int» twice = f =&gt; x =&gt; f(f(x));

 Func&lt;int, int&gt; plusThree = i =&gt; i + 3;

 var g = twice(plusThree);

 Console.WriteLine(g(7)); // 13
}
Or equivalently, with static methods:
using System;

public class Program
 private static Func&lt;int, int&gt; Twice(Func&lt;int, int&gt; f)
 return x =&gt; f(f(x));

 private static int PlusThree(int i) =&gt; i + 3;

 public static void Main(string[] args)
 var g = Twice(PlusThree);

 Console.WriteLine(g(7)); // 13
}
====Clojure====

(defn twice [f]
 (fn [x] (f (f x))))

(defn plus-three [i]
 (+ i 3))

(def g (twice plus-three))

(println (g 7)) ; 13
====ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML)====

twice = function(f) {
 return function(x) {
 return f(f(x));
};

plusThree = function(i) {
 return i + 3;

g = twice(plusThree);

writeOutput(g(7)); // 13
====Common Lisp====

(defun twice (f) 
 (lambda (x) (funcall f (funcall f x)))) 
(defun plus-three (i) 
 (+ i 3)) 
(defvar g (twice #&#x27;plus-three)) 
(print (funcall g 7)) 
====D====

import std.stdio : writeln;

alias twice = (f) =&gt; (int x) =&gt; f(f(x));

alias plusThree = (int i) =&gt; i + 3;

void main()
 auto g = twice(plusThree);

 writeln(g(7)); // 13


====Dart====

int Function(int) twice(int Function(int) f) {
 return (x) {
 return f(f(x));
}

int plusThree(int i) {
 return i + 3;

void main() {
 final g = twice(plusThree);
 print(g(7)); // 13


====Elixir====
In Elixir, you can mix module definitions and anonymous functions
defmodule Hof do
 def twice(f) do
 fn(x) -&gt; f.(f.(x)) end
 end
end

plus_three = fn(i) -&gt; i + 3 end

g = Hof.twice(plus_three)

IO.puts g.(7) # 13
Alternatively, we can also compose using pure anonymous functions.
twice = fn(f) -&gt;
 fn(x) -&gt; f.(f.(x)) end
end

plus_three = fn(i) -&gt; i + 3 end

g = twice.(plus_three)

IO.puts g.(7) # 13
====Erlang====

or_else([], _) -&gt; false;
or_else([F | Fs], X) -&gt; or_else(Fs, X, F(X)).

or_else(Fs, X, false) -&gt; or_else(Fs, X);
or_else(Fs, _, {false, Y}) -&gt; or_else(Fs, Y);
or_else(_, _, R) -&gt; R.

or_else([fun erlang:is_integer/1, fun erlang:is_atom/1, fun erlang:is_list/1], 3.23).
In this Erlang example, the higher-order function takes a list of functions () and argument (). It evaluates the function with the argument as argument. If the function returns false then the next function in will be evaluated. If the function returns then the next function in with argument will be evaluated. If the function returns the higher-order function will return . Note that , , and can be functions. The example returns .

====F#====

let twice f = f » f

let plus_three = (+) 3

let g = twice plus_three

g 7 |&gt; printf &quot;%A&quot; // 13
====Go====

package main

import &quot;fmt&quot;

func twice(f func(int) int) func(int) int {
 return func(x int) int {
 return f(f(x))
}

func main() {
 plusThree := func(i int) int {
 return i + 3

 g := twice(plusThree)

 fmt.Println(g(7)) // 13


Notice a function literal can be defined either with an identifier () or anonymously (assigned to variable ).

====Groovy====
def twice = { f, x -&gt; f(f(x)) }
def plusThree = { it + 3 }
def g = twice.curry(plusThree) 
println g(7) // 13

====Haskell====

twice :: (Int -&gt; Int) -&gt; (Int -&gt; Int)
twice f = f . f

plusThree :: Int -&gt; Int
plusThree = (+3)

main :: IO ()
main = print (g 7) -- 13
 where
 g = twice plusThree
====J====
Explicitly,
 twice=. adverb : &#x27;u u y&#x27;

 plusthree=. verb : &#x27;y + 3&#x27;
 g=. plusthree twice
 g 7
13
or tacitly,
 twice=. ^:2

 plusthree=. +&amp;3
 g=. plusthree twice
 g 7

====Java (1.8+)====
Using just functional interfaces:
import java.util.function.*;

class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 Function&lt;IntUnaryOperator, IntUnaryOperator&gt; twice = f -&gt; f.andThen(f);

 IntUnaryOperator plusThree = i -&gt; i + 3;

 var g = twice.apply(plusThree);

 System.out.println(g.applyAsInt(7)); // 13
}
Or equivalently, with static methods:
import java.util.function.*;

class Main {
 private static IntUnaryOperator twice(IntUnaryOperator f) {
 return f.andThen(f);

 private static int plusThree(int i) {
 return i + 3;

 public static void main(String[] args) {
 var g = twice(Main::plusThree);

 System.out.println(g.applyAsInt(7)); // 13
}
====JavaScript====
With arrow functions:
&quot;use strict&quot;;

const twice = f =&gt; x =&gt; f(f(x));

const plusThree = i =&gt; i + 3;

const g = twice(plusThree);

console.log(g(7)); // 13
Or with classical syntax:
&quot;use strict&quot;;

function twice(f) {
 return function (x) {
 return f(f(x));
}

function plusThree(i) {
 return i + 3;

const g = twice(plusThree);

console.log(g(7)); // 13
====Julia====

julia&gt; function twice(f)
 function result(x)
 return f(f(x))
 end
 return result
 end
twice (generic function with 1 method)

julia&gt; plusthree(i) = i + 3
plusthree (generic function with 1 method)

julia&gt; g = twice(plusthree)
(::var&quot;#result#3&quot;{typeof(plusthree)}) (generic function with 1 method)

julia&gt; g(7)
13
====Kotlin====

fun twice(f: (Int) -&gt; Int): (Int) -&gt; Int {
 return { f(f(it)) }

fun plusThree(i: Int) = i + 3

fun main() {
 val g = twice(::plusThree)

 println(g(7)) // 13


==== Lua ====

function twice(f)
 return function (x)
 return f(f(x))
 end
end

function plusThree(i)
 return i + 3
end

local g = twice(plusThree)

print(g(7)) -- 13
==== MATLAB ====

function result = twice(f)
result = @(x) f(f(x));
end

plusthree = @(i) i + 3;

g = twice(plusthree)

disp(g(7)); % 13
==== OCaml ====

let twice f x =
 f (f x)

let plus_three =
 (+) 3

let () =
 let g = twice plus_three in

 print_int (g 7); (* 13 *)
 print_newline ()
====PHP====

&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

function twice(callable $f): Closure {
 return function (int $x) use ($f): int {
 return $f($f($x));
}

function plusThree(int $i): int {
 return $i + 3;

$g = twice(&#x27;plusThree&#x27;);

echo $g(7), &quot;\n&quot;; // 13
or with all functions in variables:
&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$twice = fn(callable $f): Closure =&gt; fn(int $x): int =&gt; $f($f($x));

$plusThree = fn(int $i): int =&gt; $i + 3;

$g = $twice($plusThree);

echo $g(7), &quot;\n&quot;; // 13
Note that arrow functions implicitly capture any variables that come from the parent scope, whereas anonymous functions require the keyword to do the same.

====Perl====

use strict;
use warnings;

sub twice {
 my ($f) = @_;
 sub {
 $f-&gt;($f-&gt;(@_));
}

sub plusThree {
 my ($i) = @_;
 $i + 3;

my $g = twice(\&amp;plusThree);

print $g-&gt;(7), &quot;\n&quot;; # 13
or with all functions in variables:
use strict;
use warnings;

my $twice = sub {
 my ($f) = @_;
 sub {
 $f-&gt;($f-&gt;(@_));
};

my $plusThree = sub {
 my ($i) = @_;
 $i + 3;

my $g = $twice-&gt;($plusThree);

print $g-&gt;(7), &quot;\n&quot;; # 13
====Python====

»&gt; def twice(f):
... def result(x):
... return f(f(x))
... return result

»&gt; plus_three = lambda i: i + 3

»&gt; g = twice(plus_three)
»&gt; g(7)
13
Python decorator syntax is often used to replace a function with the result of passing that function through a higher-order function. E.g., the function could be implemented equivalently:
»&gt; @twice
... def g(i):
... return i + 3

»&gt; g(7)
13
====R====

twice &lt;- \(f) \(x) f(f(x))

plusThree &lt;- function(i) i + 3

g &lt;- twice(plusThree)

&gt; g(7)
[1] 13
====Raku====

sub twice(Callable:D $f) {
 return sub { $f($f($^x)) };

sub plusThree(Int:D $i) {
 return $i + 3;

my $g = twice(&amp;plusThree);

say $g(7); # 13
In Raku, all code objects are closures and therefore can reference inner &quot;lexical&quot; variables from an outer scope because the lexical variable is &quot;closed&quot; inside of the function. Raku also supports &quot;pointy block&quot; syntax for lambda expressions which can be assigned to a variable or invoked anonymously.

====Ruby====

def twice(f)
 -&gt;(x) { f.call(f.call(x)) }
end

plus_three = -&gt;(i) { i + 3 }

g = twice(plus_three)

puts g.call(7) # 13
====Rust====

fn twice(f: impl Fn(i32) -&gt; i32) -&gt; impl Fn(i32) -&gt; i32 {
 move |x| f(f(x))

fn plus_three(i: i32) -&gt; i32 {
 i + 3

fn main() {
 let g = twice(plus_three);

 println!(&quot;{}&quot;, g(7)) // 13


====Scala====

object Main {
 def twice(f: Int =&gt; Int): Int =&gt; Int =
 f compose f

 def plusThree(i: Int): Int =
 i + 3

 def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
 val g = twice(plusThree)

 print(g(7)) // 13
}
====Scheme====

(define (compose f g) 
 (lambda (x) (f (g x))))

(define (twice f) 
 (compose f f))

(define (plus-three i)
 (+ i 3))

(define g (twice plus-three))

(display (g 7)) ; 13
(display &quot;\n&quot;)
====Swift====

func twice(_ f: @escaping (Int) -&gt; Int) -&gt; (Int) -&gt; Int {
 return { f(f($0)) }

let plusThree = { $0 + 3 }

let g = twice(plusThree)

print(g(7)) // 13
====Tcl====

set twice 
set plusThree 

# result: 13
puts [apply $twice $plusThree 7]
Tcl uses apply command to apply an anonymous function (since 8.6).

====XACML====
The XACML standard defines higher-order functions in the standard to apply a function to multiple values of attribute bags.
rule allowEntry{
 permit
 condition anyOfAny(function[stringEqual], citizenships, allowedCitizenships)


The list of higher-order functions in XACML can be found here.

====XQuery====

declare function local:twice($f, $x) {
 $f($f($x))

declare function local:plusthree($i) {
 $i + 3

local:twice(local:plusthree#1, 7) (: 13 :)
=== Alternatives ===
====Function pointers====
Function pointers in languages such as C, C++, Fortran, and Pascal allow programmers to pass around references to functions. The following C code computes an approximation of the integral of an arbitrary function:
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

double square(double x)
 return x * x;

double cube(double x)
 return x * x * x;

/* Compute the integral of f() within the interval [a,b] */
double integral(double f(double x), double a, double b, int n)
 int i;
 double sum = 0;
 double dt = (b - a) / n;
 for (i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {
 sum += f(a + (i + 0.5) * dt);
 return sum * dt;

int main()
 printf(&quot;%g\n&quot;, integral(square, 0, 1, 100));
 printf(&quot;%g\n&quot;, integral(cube, 0, 1, 100));
 return 0;


The qsort function from the C standard library uses a function pointer to emulate the behavior of a higher-order function.

====Macros====
Macros can also be used to achieve some of the effects of higher-order functions. However, macros cannot easily avoid the problem of variable capture; they may also result in large amounts of duplicated code, which can be more difficult for a compiler to optimize. Macros are generally not strongly typed, although they may produce strongly typed code.

====Dynamic code evaluation====
In other imperative programming languages, it is possible to achieve some of the same algorithmic results as are obtained via higher-order functions by dynamically executing code (sometimes called &quot;Eval&quot; or &quot;Execute&quot; operations) in the scope of evaluation. There can be significant drawbacks to this approach:
*The argument code to be executed is usually not statically typed; these languages generally rely on dynamic typing to determine the well-formedness and safety of the code to be executed.
*The argument is usually provided as a string, the value of which may not be known until run-time. This string must either be compiled during program execution (using just-in-time compilation) or evaluated by interpretation, causing some added overhead at run-time, and usually generating less efficient code.

====Objects====
In object-oriented programming languages that do not support higher-order functions, objects can be an effective substitute. An object&#x27;s methods act in essence like functions, and a method may accept objects as parameters and produce objects as return values. Objects often carry added run-time overhead compared to pure functions, however, and added boilerplate code for defining and instantiating an object and its method(s). Languages that permit stack-based (versus heap-based) objects or structs can provide more flexibility with this method.

An example of using a simple stack based record in Free Pascal with a function that returns a function:
program example;

type 
 int = integer;
 Txy = record x, y: int; end;
 Tf = function (xy: Txy): int;
function f(xy: Txy): int; 
begin 
 Result := xy.y + xy.x; 
end;

function g(func: Tf): Tf; 
begin 
 result := func; 
end;

var 
 a: Tf;
 xy: Txy = (x: 3; y: 7);

begin 
 a := g(@f); // return a function to &quot;a&quot;
 writeln(a(xy)); // prints 10
end.
The function codice_3 takes a codice_4 record as input and returns the integer value of the sum of the record&#x27;s codice_5 and codice_6 fields (3 + 7).

====Defunctionalization====
Defunctionalization can be used to implement higher-order functions in languages that lack first-class functions:
// Defunctionalized function data structures
template&lt;typename T&gt; struct Add { T value; };
template&lt;typename T&gt; struct DivBy { T value; };
template&lt;typename F, typename G&gt; struct Composition { F f; G g; };

// Defunctionalized function application implementations
template&lt;typename F, typename G, typename X&gt;
auto apply(Composition&lt;F, G&gt; f, X arg) {
 return apply(f.f, apply(f.g, arg));

template&lt;typename T, typename X&gt;
auto apply(Add&lt;T&gt; f, X arg) {
 return arg + f.value;

template&lt;typename T, typename X&gt;
auto apply(DivBy&lt;T&gt; f, X arg) {
 return arg / f.value;

// Higher-order compose function
template&lt;typename F, typename G&gt;
Composition&lt;F, G&gt; compose(F f, G g) {
 return Composition&lt;F, G&gt; {f, g};

int main(int argc, const char* argv[]) {
 auto f = compose(DivBy&lt;float&gt;{ 2.0f }, Add&lt;int&gt;{ 5 });
 apply(f, 3); // 4.0f
 apply(f, 9); // 7.0f
 return 0;


In this case, different types are used to trigger different functions via function overloading. The overloaded function in this example has the signature codice_7.

<text>David McClure Brinkley (July 10, 1920 – June 11, 2003) was an American newscaster for NBC and ABC in a career lasting from 1943 to 1997.

From 1956 through 1970, he co-anchored NBC&#x27;s top-rated nightly news program, &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report,&quot; with Chet Huntley and thereafter appeared as co-anchor or commentator on its successor, &quot;NBC Nightly News,&quot; through the 1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s, Brinkley was host of the popular Sunday &quot;This Week with David Brinkley&quot; program and a top commentator on election-night coverage for ABC News. Over the course of his career, Brinkley received ten Emmy Awards, three George Foster Peabody Awards, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

He wrote three books, including the 1988 bestseller &quot;Washington Goes to War&quot;, about how World War II transformed the nation&#x27;s capital. His books were largely based on his own observations as a young reporter in the city.

==Early life==
Brinkley was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, the youngest of five children born to William Graham Brinkley and Mary MacDonald (née West) Brinkley. He began writing for a local newspaper, the &quot;Wilmington Morning Star&quot;, while still attending New Hanover High School. He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Emory University, and Vanderbilt University, before entering service in the U.S. Army in 1940. Following a medical discharge, Brinkley worked for United Press International in several of its Southern bureaus. In 1943, he moved to Washington, D.C., looking for a radio job at CBS News. Instead, Brinkley took a job at NBC News, became its White House correspondent, and in time began appearing on television.

==Career==
In 1952, Brinkley began providing Washington reporting on NBC Television&#x27;s evening news program, the &quot;Camel News Caravan&quot; (the name changed over time), hosted by John Cameron Swayze. In 1956, NBC News executives considered various possibilities to anchor the network&#x27;s coverage of the Democratic and Republican political conventions, and when executive J. Davidson Taylor suggested pairing two reporters (he had in mind Bill Henry and Ray Scherer), producer Reuven Frank, who favored Brinkley for the job, and NBC&#x27;s director of news, Joseph Meyers, who favored Chet Huntley, proposed combining Huntley and Brinkley. NBC&#x27;s top brass consented, but they had so little confidence in the team that they withheld announcing it for two months. Their concern proved unfounded.

The pairing worked so well that on October 29, 1956, the two took over NBC&#x27;s flagship nightly newscast, with Huntley in New York City and Brinkley in Washington, D.C., for the newly christened &quot;Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot;. Brinkley&#x27;s dry wit offset the serious tone set by Huntley, and the program proved popular with audiences turned off by the incessantly serious tone of CBS&#x27;s news broadcasts of that era. Brinkley&#x27;s ability to write for the ear with simple, declarative sentences gained him a reputation as one of the medium&#x27;s most talented writers, and his connections in Washington led CBS&#x27;s Roger Mudd to observe, &quot;Brinkley, of all the TV guys here, probably has the best sense of the city — best understands its moods and mentality. He knows Washington and he knows the people.&quot; Most often described as &quot;wry&quot;, Brinkley once suggested on the air that the best way to resolve the controversy over whether to change the name of Boulder Dam to &quot;Hoover Dam&quot; was to have former president Herbert Hoover change his name to &quot;Herbert Boulder&quot;.

Another example of Brinkley&#x27;s wryness was evinced on the third night of Chicago&#x27;s infamous Democratic Convention of 1968. After continuous abuses of NBC correspondents made on the floor of the convention — namely, interference and shadowing of the media staff by supporters of Hubert Humphrey, presumably with connections to political boss Richard J. Daley — Brinkley criticized Daley&#x27;s alleged interference with freedom of the press following Senator Abraham Ribicoff&#x27;s stormy nomination of George McGovern. Perhaps in reply to a control room request for objectivity and alluding to Daley&#x27;s refusal to be interviewed by NBC&#x27;s John Chancellor earlier in the evening, Brinkley was heard over the noise of the McGovern demonstration saying, &quot;Mayor Daley had his chance!&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, &quot;now give the McGovern people theirs&quot;).

Huntley and Brinkley&#x27;s nightly sign-off — &quot;Good night, Chet,&quot; Brinkley would intone; &quot;Good night, David,&quot; Huntley would reply — entered popular usage and was followed by the beginning of the second movement of Beethoven&#x27;s 9th Symphony as the program credits rolled. &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot; was America&#x27;s most popular television newscast until it was overtaken, at the end of the 1960s, by the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, anchored by Walter Cronkite. Brinkley and his co-anchor gained such celebrity that Brinkley was forced to cut short his reporting on Hubert Humphrey in the 1960 West Virginia primary because West Virginians were more interested in meeting Brinkley than the candidate. From 1961 to 1963, Brinkley anchored a prime time news magazine, &quot;David Brinkley&#x27;s Journal&quot;. Produced by Ted Yates, the program won a George Foster Peabody Award and two Emmy Awards.

On November 22, 1963, Brinkley helped cover the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy for NBC News from Washington. He opened the Huntley-Brinkley Report that night by saying &quot;Good evening. The essential facts are these: President Kennedy was murdered in Dallas, Texas. He was shot by a sniper hiding in a building near his parade route. He was dead within an hour. Lyndon Johnson is President of the United States&quot;. Later that night, after the news of the Presidents death was confirmed Brinkley said in a commentary at around 1:00 the next morning &quot;It has all been shocking, but perhaps one element in the shock was the speed. At a little after one o&#x27;clock this afternoon President Kennedy was as about as alive as any human being ever gets. Young, strong, vigorous looking forward to another 5 years of leadership of this country and of the western world... By 6:00 President Kennedy had been murdered Lyndon Johnson was President of the United States, Mrs. Kennedy was a widow, a brave and composed one no could fail to admire, all of them were back in Washington... In about 4 hours we had gone from President Kennedy in Dallas alive, to back in Washington dead, and a new President in his place. There is no more news here tonight and really no more to say, except what has happened today has been too much, too ugly and too fast&quot;.
When Huntley retired from the anchor chair in 1970, the evening news program was renamed &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, and Brinkley co-anchored the broadcast with John Chancellor and Frank McGee. In 1971, Chancellor was named sole anchor, and Brinkley became the program&#x27;s commentator, delivering three-minute perspectives several times a week under a reprise of the earlier title, &quot;David Brinkley&#x27;s Journal&quot;. By 1976, though, NBC had decided to revive the dual-anchor format, and Brinkley once again anchored the Washington desk for the network until October 1979. But the early years of &quot;Nightly News&quot; never achieved the popularity of &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot;, and none of several news magazine shows anchored by Brinkley during the 1970s succeeded. An unhappy Brinkley left NBC in 1981; &quot;NBC Magazine&quot; was his last show for that network.

Almost immediately, Brinkley was offered a job at ABC. ABC News president Roone Arledge was anxious to replace ABC&#x27;s Sunday morning talk show, &quot;Issues and Answers&quot;, which had always lagged far behind CBS&#x27;s &quot;Face the Nation&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. Brinkley was tapped for the job and in 1981 began hosting &quot;This Week with David Brinkley&quot;. &quot;This Week&quot; revolutionized the Sunday morning news program format, featuring not only several correspondents interviewing guest newsmakers, but concluding with a roundtable discussion. The format proved highly successful and was soon imitated by ABC&#x27;s NBC and CBS rivals as well as engendering new programs originating both nationally and from local stations.

For a brief period after Washington-based &quot;World News Tonight&quot; anchor Frank Reynolds was diagnosed with hepatitis that ultimately claimed his life on July 20, 1983, Brinkley returned to the network anchor desk as Reynolds&#x27; substitute from Washington. This arrangement lasted until July 4; when Reynolds&#x27; eventual successor as the network anchor, Peter Jennings, was brought in from his post in London.

As part of ABC&#x27;s commemoration of World War II, Brinkley and the News division produced the special, &quot;The Battle of the Bulge: 50 Years On&quot;, with Brinkley hosting and interviewing survivors of the battle, Allied and Axis. The special, which aired at Christmas 1994, was critically acclaimed and widely viewed.

==Retirement==
Days before Brinkley announced his retirement from regular news coverage, Brinkley made a rare, on-air mistake during evening coverage of the 1996 United States presidential election at a moment when he thought he was on commercial break. One of his colleagues asked him what he thought of the prospects for Bill Clinton&#x27;s re-election. He called Clinton &quot;a bore&quot; and added, &quot;The next four years will be filled with pretty words and pretty music and a lot of goddamn nonsense!&quot; Peter Jennings pointed out that they were still on the air. Brinkley said, &quot;Really?! Well, I&#x27;m leaving anyway!&quot;. Brinkley would offer Clinton an apology during a one-on-one interview a week later.

Brinkley&#x27;s last broadcast as host of &quot;This Week&quot; was November 10, 1996, but he continued to provide short pieces of commentary for the show until September 28, 1997. He then fully retired from television.

In addition to ten Emmys and three Peabodys, Brinkley received the Alfred I. duPont Award in 1958. In 1982, he received the Paul White Award for lifetime achievement from the Radio Television Digital News Association. In 1988, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor. Bush called him &quot;the elder statesman of broadcast journalism&quot;. In an interview in 1992, he said, &quot;Most of my life, I&#x27;ve simply been a reporter covering things and writing and talking about it.&quot;

==Personal life==
David Brinkley married the former Flora Ann Fischer in 1946 and had three sons; they divorced in 1972. Brinkley married Susan Melanie Benfer the same year. Their marriage lasted until Brinkley&#x27;s death.

Brinkley was the father of the late historian and former Columbia University provost Alan Brinkley and the late Stanford journalism professor and Pulitzer Prize–winning writer Joel Brinkley.

==Death==
Brinkley died at his home in Houston on June 11, 2003, from complications of a fall suffered at his vacation home in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, according to his son, John Brinkley. His body is interred at Oakdale Cemetery, Wilmington, North Carolina.

<doc id="244703" wikidata="Q672134" url="?curid=244703" title="Music of France">
<text>In France, music reflects a diverse array of styles. In the field of classical music, France has produced several prominent romantic composers, while folk and popular music have seen the rise of the chanson and cabaret style. The oldest playable musical recordings were made in France using the earlist known sound recording device in the world, the phonautograph, which was patented by Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville in 1857. France is also the 5th largest market by value in the world, and its music industry has produced many internationally renowned artists, especially in the nouvelle chanson and electronic music.

==Classical music==
===Medieval===

French music history dates back to organum in the 10th century, followed by the Notre Dame School, an organum composition style. Troubadour songs of chivalry and courtly love were composed in the Occitan language between the 10th and 13th centuries, and the Trouvère poet-composers flourished in Northern France during this period. The fiddle was their instrument of choice. By the end of the 12th century, a form of song called the motet arose, accompanied by traveling musicians called jongleurs. In the 14th century, France produced two notable styles of music, Ars Nova and Ars Subtilior

===Renaissance===
Burgundy, which was the mostly French-speaking area unified with the Kingdom of France in 1477, had become a major center for musical development in the musical continent Europe. This was followed by the rise of chansons and the Burgundian School.

===Baroque===

Influential composers included Jean-Baptiste Lully, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Élisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre, Louis Couperin, François Couperin and Jacques Champion de Chambonnières. Jean Philippe Rameau, a prominent opera composer, wrote an influential treatise on musical theory, especially in the subject of harmony; he also introduced the clarinet into his orchestras. In the late Renaissance and early Baroque period, a type of popular secular vocal music called &quot;Air de cour&quot; spread throughout France.

=== Opera ===
The first French opera may be &quot;Akébar roi du Mogol&quot;, first performed in Carpentras in 1646. It was followed by the team of Pierre Perrin and Cambert, whose &quot;Pastoral in Music&quot;, performed in Issy, was a success, and the pair moved to Paris to produce &quot;Pomone&quot; (1671) and &quot;Les Peines et les Plaisirs de l&#x27;Amour&quot; (1672).

Jean-Baptiste Lully, who had become well known for composing ballets for Louis XIV, began creating a French version of the Italian &quot;opera seria&quot;, a kind of tragic opera known as &quot;tragédie lyrique&quot; or &quot;tragédie en musique&quot; - see (French lyric tragedy). His first was &quot;Cadmus&quot; from 1673. Lully&#x27;s forays into operatic tragedy were accompanied by the pinnacle of French theatrical tragedy, led by Corneille and Racine.

Lully also developed the common beat patterns used by conductors to this day and was the first to take the role of leading the orchestra from the position of the first violin.

The French composer Georges Bizet composed Carmen, one of the best-known and most popular operas.

===Classical era===

Claude Balbastre was an organist, harpsichordist and fortepianist. He was one of the most famous musicians of his time.

Henri-Montan Berton, son of Pierre, is principally remembered as a composer of operas, most of which were first performed at the Opéra-Comique.

Chélard earned his living for much of his career as a violist at the Paris Opera. His 1827 opera Macbeth was a flop in Paris, but a great success in Munich.

Jeanne-Hippolyte Devismes married the director of the Paris Opéra. Her only known works are a song, &quot;La Dame Jacinthe&quot;, and an opera, Praxitėle, which was a success and ran for 16 performances.

Harpsichordist and composer Jacques Duphly contributed to Jean-Jacques Rousseau dictionary, for articles relating to the art of playing the harpsichord.

===Romantic era===

One of the major French composers of the time, and one of the most innovative composers of the early Romantic era, was Hector Berlioz.

In the late 19th century, pioneers such as Georges Bizet, Jules Massenet, Gabriel Fauré, Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy revitalized French music. The last two had an enormous impact on 20th-century music - both in France and abroad - and influenced many major composers such as Béla Bartók and Igor Stravinsky. Erik Satie was also a very significant composer from that era. His music is difficult to classify.
===20th century===
The early 20th century saw neo-classical music flourish in France, especially composers such as Lili Boulanger, Nadia Boulanger, Albert Roussel and Les Six, a group of musicians who gathered around Satie. Later in the century, Olivier Messiaen, Henri Dutilleux and Pierre Boulez proved influential. The latter was a leading figure of Serialism while Messiaen incorporated Asian (particularly Indian) influences and bird song and Dutilleux translated the innovations of Debussy, Bartók and Stravinsky into his own, very personal, musical idiom.

The most important French contribution to musical innovation of the past 35 years is a form of computer-assisted composition called &quot;spectral music&quot;. The astonishing technical advances of the spectralist composers in the 1970s are only recently beginning to achieve wide recognition in the United States; major composers in this vein include Gérard Grisey, Tristan Murail, and Claude Vivier.

==Folk music==
Traditional styles of music have survived most in remote areas such as the island of Corsica and mountainous Auvergne, as well as the more nationalistic regions of the Basques and the Bretons. In many cases, folk traditions were revived in relatively recent years to cater to tourists. These &quot;groupes folkloriques&quot; tend to focus on very early 20th-century melodies and the use of the piano accordion.

===Paris===

In 1900 in Paris, a new style of waltz emerged, the &quot;Valse musette&quot; an evolution of Bal-musette also known as &quot;French Waltz&quot;. Aimable, Émile Vacher, Marcel Azzola, Yvette Horner, André Verchuren were famous accordionists who played valse musette. There is also Yann Tiersen and its Amélie (soundtrack) of Amélie from Montmartre.

===West France===
The West of France comprises the Pays de Nantes, the provinces of Vendée, Anjou and Maine, and the Poitou-Charentes region. Traditions of ballad-singing, dance-songs and fiddle-playing have survived, predominantly in Poitou and the Vendée. Jérôme Bujeaud collected extensively in the area, and his 2-volume work &quot;Chants et chansons populaires des provinces de l&#x27;ouest: Poitou, Saintonge, Aunis et Angoumois&quot; (Niort, 1866) remains the principal scholarly collection of music and songs. In recent decades John Wright and Claude Ribouillault (amongst others) have done much to collect, analyse and promote the surviving traditions.
The Marais Breton of Vendée is noted particularly for its tradition of veuze playing - which has been revived by the bagpipe-maker and player Thierry Bertrand - and for traditional singers such as Pierre Burgaud.

Folk dances specific to the West of France include the courante, or maraichine, and the bal saintongeais. Bourrées in triple time have been noted in the 19th century by Bujeaud, and more recently, in Angoumois. Circle- or chain-dances accompanied by caller-and-response singing have been noted in the West, and also in other regions such as Gascony, Normandy and Brittany.

Notable contemporary folk musicians include Christian Pacher and Claude Ribouillault (Poitou) and the group La Marienne (Vendée.)

====Brittany====


Distinctly Celtic in character, the folk music of Lower Brittany has had perhaps the most successful revival of its traditions, partly thanks to the city of Lorient, which hosts France&#x27;s most popular music festival: Festival Interceltique de Lorient.

The documented history of Breton music begins with the publication of &quot;Barzaz-Breizh&quot; in 1839. A collection of folk songs compiled by Hersart de la Villemarqué, &quot;Barzaz-Breizh&quot; re-branded and promoted Breton traditions and helped ensure their continuity.

Sonneurs couples, consisting of a bombard and a biniou (bagpipe), is usually played at festoù-noz (Fest Noz) celebrations (some are famous, such as Printemps de Chateauneuf ). It is swift dance music and has an older vocal counterpart called &quot;kan ha diskan&quot;. Unaccompanied call and response singing was interspersed with the &quot;gwerz&quot;, a form of ballad.

Probably the most popular form of Breton folk is the bagad pipe band, which features native instruments such as biniou and bombard alongside drums and, in more modern groups, biniou braz pipes. Modern revivalists include Kevrenn Alre Bagad and Bagad Kemper.

Alan Stivell is perhaps the most influential folk-rock performer of continental Europe. After 1971&#x27;s &quot;Renaissance of the Celtic Harp&quot;, Breton and other Celtic traditional music achieved mainstream success internationally. With Dan Ar Braz, he then released &quot;Chemins de Terre&quot; (1974), which launched Breton folk-rock. This set the stage for stars such as Malicorne in the ensuing decades.

In later years much has been done to collect and popularize the musical traditions of the Pays Gallo of Upper Brittany, for which the singer Bertran Ôbrée, his group Ôbrée Alie and the association DASTUM must take much credit. The songs of Upper Brittany are either in French or in Gallo.

Modern Breton folk music includes harpists such as Anne-Marie Jan, Anne Auffret and Myrdhin, while singers Kristen Nikolas, Andrea Ar Gouilh and Yann-Fanch Kemener have become mainstream stars. Instrumental bands, however, have been the most successful, including Gwerz, Bleizi Ruz, Strobinell, Sonerien Du and Tud.

===Central France===

Central France includes the regions of Auvergne, Limousin, Morvan, Nivernais, Bourbonnais and Berry. The lands are the home to a significant bagpipe tradition, as well as the iconic hurdy-gurdy and the dance bourrée. There are deep differences between the regions of Central France, with the Auvergne and Limousin retained the most vibrant folk traditions of the area. As an example of the area&#x27;s diversity, the bourrée can come in either duple or triple meter; the latter is found in the south of the region, and is usually improvised with bagpipes and hurdy-gurdy, while the former is found in the north and includes virtuoso players.

====Bagpipe and Hurdy-gurdy====
The hurdy-gurdy, or &quot;vielle-à-roue&quot;, is essentially a mechanical violin, with keys or buttons instead of a fingerboard. It is made up of a curved, oval body, a set of keys and a curved handle, which is turned and connected to a wheel which bows the strings that are stopped by the keys. There is a moveable bridge, a variable number of drones and optional sympathetic strings. Other forms of the hurdy-gurdy are found all over Europe.

The bagpipe is found in a wide array of forms in France. The &quot;cabrette&quot; and &quot;grande cornemuse&quot; from Auvergne and Berry are best known. These forms are found at least as far back as the 17th century. Prominent bagpipers include Bernard Blanc, Frédéric Paris and Philippe Prieur, as well as bandleader Jean Blanchard of La Grande Bande de Cornemuses and Quintette de Cornemuses. Frédéric Paris is also known as a member of the Duo Chabenat-Paris, who use elements such as mixed polyphonic ensembles and melodies based on the bourrée. Bernard Blanc and Jean Blanchard, along with Éric Montbel from Lyon, were among the musicians who formed the basis of La Bamboche and Le Grand Rouge. It was these two bands who did more than anyone to revitalize the traditions of Central France during the 1970s folk revival. The festival of St. Chartier, a music festival held annually near Châteauroux, has been a focal point for the music of Auvergne and Limousin.

The regions of Morvan and Nivernais have produced some traditional stars, including Faubourg de Boignard and Les Ménétriers du Morvan, respectively. The Nivernais collector Achille Millien was also notable in the early part of the 20th century.

===South France===

====Basque Country====

The music of the French Basque Country (east of the Basque Country) should be considered against a Pyrenean cultural background. Up to recent times and still ttun-ttun and xirula should be highlighted in traditional folk music (especially in the province of Soule) as a tabor and pipe like pair.

Mixel Etxekopar or Jean Mixel Bedaxagar have played a major role in Basque traditional music as xirula players as well as traditional singers. Other popular performers such as Benat Achiary take on a more experimental approach. These performers refer to a former tradition collected and restored by figures such as Etxahun Iruri (1908–1979) where singing improviser poets (bertsolaris) played an important role in popular culture. This &quot;bertsolari&quot; tradition relies almost exclusively on younger generations, and efforts are being made now to restore it along the lines of the &quot;southern&quot; tradition, i.e. of the Spanish Basque Country.

Music from the Basque Country nowadays caters to almost all the tastes of music, with a wide range of music being played in Basque, from choral music (Oldarra in Biarritz) to elaborate music bands (e.g. Bidaia) to ska or hardcore trends, while it is much praised lately for the fine bare voices that have arisen with the likes of Maddi Oihenart, Maialen Errotabehere or Amaren Alabak, to mention but a few.

====Corsica====
Corsican polyphonic singing is perhaps the most unusual of the French regional music varieties. Sung by male trios, it is strongly harmonic and occasionally dissonant. Works can be either spiritual or secular. Modern groups include Canta u Populu Corsu, I Muvrini, Tavagna and Chjami Aghjalesi; some groups have been associated with Corsican nationalism.

Corsican musical instruments include the &quot;caramusa&quot; (cornemuse bagpipe), &quot;cetera&quot; (16-stringed lute), &quot;mandulina&quot; (mandolin), &quot;pifana&quot; (a type of gemshorn) and &quot;urganettu&quot; (diatonic accordion).

==Popular music==

The 20th century saw the apogee of the Cabaret style with Yvette Guilbert as a major star. The era lasted through to the 1930s and saw the likes of Édith Piaf, Charles Trenet, Maurice Chevalier, Tino Rossi, Félix Mayol, Lucienne Boyer, Marie-Louise Damien, Marie Dubas, Fréhel, Georges Guibourg and Jean Sablon.

During the 50s and 60s, it was the golden age of &quot;Chanson Française&quot;: Juliette Gréco, Mireille Mathieu, Georges Brassens, Jacques Brel, Gilbert Bécaud, Monique Serf (Barbara), Léo Ferré, Charles Aznavour and Alain Barrière. The Yéyé style was popular in the 1950s and 60s with Sheila, Claude François,
Françoise Hardy and Johnny Hallyday. This era also saw Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin experiment with avant-garde pop, integrating provocative themes and diverse musical styles, marking French pop as emotionally sophisticated and distinct.

The 1970s brought disco, progressive rock, and electronic influences. Artists like Michel Sardou, Claude François, and Daft Punk merged French pop with global trends. Jean-Michel Jarre pioneered electronic music, notably with Oxygène, pushing French music onto the world stage. In the 1980s, French pop fused international genres with artists like Vanessa Paradis and Mylène Farmer, alongside the rise of chanson nouvelle, led by Etienne Daho and Alain Bashung. This era was marked by new wave, synth-pop, and rock influences, reflecting France’s shifting cultural landscape. By the 1990s, French pop achieved global success, especially through electronic music with Daft Punk, Air, and the French touch movement. This period also saw the rise of variété française, with artists like Céline Dion and Zazie gaining international acclaim while staying rooted in French culture.

===Cabaret===

&quot;Cabaret&quot; is a typical form of French musical entertainment featuring chanson, music, dance, comedy and spectacles. The audience usually sits at tables, often dining or drinking, and performances are sometimes introduced by a master of ceremonies. The first cabaret was opened in 1881 in Montmartre, Paris, by Rodolphe Salis and was called &quot;Le Chat Noir&quot; (The Black Cat). Built in 1889, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is famous for the large red windmill on its roof. Other popular French cabarets include the &quot;Folies Bergère&quot; and &quot;Le Lido&quot;. Cabarets were a key venue in the careers of many singers such as Mistinguett, Josephine Baker, Charles Trenet and Edith Piaf. More recently, Patricia Kaas embodies the revival of the French cabaret style.

===Cancan===

The &quot;Cancan&quot;, also called &quot;French-Cancan&quot;, is a high-energy and physically demanding musical dance, traditionally performed by a chorus line of female dancers who wear costumes with long skirts, petticoats, and black stockings. The main features of the dance are the lifting and manipulation of the skirts, with high kicking and suggestive, provocative body movements. The &quot;Infernal Galop&quot; from Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot; is the tune most associated with the &quot;Cancan&quot;. The &quot;Cancan&quot; first appeared in the working-class ballrooms of Montparnasse in Paris in around 1830. It was a more lively version of the Galop, a dance in quick 2/4 time, which often featured as the final figure in the Quadrille.

===Chanson===

Chanson Française is the typical style of French music (chanson means &quot;song&quot; in French) and is still very popular in France. Some of the most important artists included: Édith Piaf, Juliette Gréco, Mireille Mathieu, Jacques Brel, Georges Brassens, Gilbert Bécaud, Monique Serf (Barbara), Léo Ferré, Charles Aznavour, Salvatore Adamo and Dalida plus the more art-house musicians like Brigitte Fontaine. Also during the 1950s one of the more representative of Montmartre cabaret singers was Suzanne Robert.

During the 1970s, new artists modernized the chanson Française (Michel Fugain, Renaud, Francis Cabrel, Alain Souchon, Jacques Higelin, Alain Chamfort, Joe Dassin) and also in the 80s (Étienne Daho, Têtes Raides) till now (Benjamin Biolay, Zaz, Vincent Delerm, Bénabar, Jean-Louis Murat, Miossec, Juliette, Mano Solo, Jacques Higelin, Matthieu Chedid, Mathieu Boogaerts, Daniel Darc, Maurane, Christina Goh, Renan Luce). Singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg began as a jazz musician in the 1950s and spanned several eras of French popular music including pop, rock, reggae, new wave, disco and even hip hop.

===Musette===

&quot;Musette&quot; is a style of French music and dance that became popular in Paris in the 1880s. Musette uses the accordion as main instrument, and often symbolizes the French art of living abroad. Émile Vacher (1883-1969) was the star of the new style. Other popular musette accordionists include Aimable Pluchard, Yvette Horner and André Verchuren. In 2001, the musette-style was a huge international success through the album &quot;Amélie&quot; composed by Yann Tiersen.

===Yéyé===

&quot;Yéyé&quot; is a style of popular music that emerged from France in the early 1960s. The yé-yé movement had its origins in the radio programme &quot;Salut les copains&quot;, which was first aired in October 1959. Most famous Yéyé stars include Johnny Hallyday, Eddy Mitchell, Richard Anthony, Dick Rivers and the popular girls such as France Gall, Sheila, Sylvie Vartan, and artists who fuse various music genres such as Chantal Goya, Dalida or Claude François. These were popular female teen idols, and included Françoise Hardy, who was the first to write her own songs.
==Contemporary music==
===Nouvelle Chanson===
===Jazz===
===Pop===

The more commercial and pop part of &quot;Chanson&quot; is called &quot;Variété&quot; in French, and included Vanessa Paradis, Patricia Kaas, Patrick Bruel, Marc Lavoine, Pascal Obispo, Florent Pagny, Francis Cabrel, Étienne Daho, Alain Souchon, Laurent Voulzy and Jean-Jacques Goldman. The superstar status of diva Mylène Farmer inspired pop-rock performers such as Zazie, Lorie, Alizée, and R&amp;B singers like Nâdiya and Ophelie Winter.

More recently, the success of musical television shows have spawned a new generation of young pop-music stars including Nolwenn Leroy, Grégory Lemarchal, Christophe Willem, Julien Doré and Élodie Frégé. The French-Caribbean singer Shy&#x27;m enjoys a status of popstar in France since her first album in 2006, as well as her male counterpart Matt Pokora. Notable pop-rock groups include Niagara and Indochine. Michel Sardou is also known for his love songs (&quot;La maladie d&#x27;amour&quot;, &quot;Je vais t&#x27;aimer&quot;).

===Rock===
Rock&#x27;n Roll started to become popular in the 60s with singers like Johnny Hallyday. There were also innovative musicians in France as the psychedelic rock trend was peaking worldwide. Jean-Pierre Massiera&#x27;s &quot;Les Maledictus Sound&quot; (1968) and Aphrodite&#x27;s Child&#x27;s &quot;666&quot; were the most influential. Later came bands such as Magma, Martin Circus, Au Bonheur des Dames, Trust, Téléphone. In the early 70s, Breton musician Alan Stivell (&quot;Renaissance de la Harpe Celtique&quot;) launched the field of French folk-rock by combining psychedelic and progressive rock sounds with Breton and Celtic folk styles. In the 80s and 90s, bands like Noir Désir and artists like Paul Personne carried the torch with grunge and blues influences. 

French rock has continued to evolve, blending genres and embracing new influences. Bands like Phoenix and Air brought French rock to international audiences, mixing elements of indie, electronic, and pop with traditional rock. Phoenix’s 2009 album Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix won global acclaim, blending indie rock with catchy, upbeat sounds. In the 2010s, Indochine, Shaka Ponk, and La Femme pushed the boundaries further, combining rock with electronic, funk, and psychedelic influences. Indochine, a long-standing group, continued to captivate with their mix of new wave and rock.

;Progressive Rock
France became one of the leading producers of Progressive rock in the 1970s. Aficionados worldwide were enamoured by recordings such as Ange&#x27;s &quot;Le Cimetiere des arlequins&quot;, Pulsar&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot;, Shylock&#x27;s &quot;Ile de Fievre&quot;, Atoll&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Araignee-Mal&quot; and Eskaton&#x27;s &quot;Ardeur&quot;. Most well-known, however, may be the band Magma which created its own genre, Zeuhl music.

;Eighties Rock (1980)
In the 1980s, French rock spawned myriad styles, many closely connected with other Francophone musical scenes in Switzerland, Canada and especially Belgium. Pub rock (Telephone), psychobilly (La Muerte), pop punk (Les Thugs), synthpop and punk rock (Bérurier Noir, Bijou and Gill Dougherty) were among the styles represented in this era. Beginning in the 1980s, Les Rita Mitsouko became very popular throughout Europe with their unique blending of punk, new wave, dance and cabaret elements.

Punk rock had arisen in the 1970s and continued into the next decade, perhaps best represented by Minimum Vital who are still active, Oberkampf and Métal Urbain. 80s progressive rock peaked early in the decade, with Dün&#x27;s &quot;Eros&quot;, Emeraude&#x27;s &quot;Geoffroy&quot; and Terpandre&#x27;s &quot;Terpandre&quot;, all from 1981, representing the genre&#x27;s pinnacle, in French West Indies (Guadeloupe Island) The Bolokos represent the genre.

===Metal===
French heavy metal bands include Gojira, Dagoba, Anorexia Nervosa, Hacride, Eths, Loudblast, Carcariass, Massacra, Gorod, Kronos, Yyrkoon, Benighted, Necrowretch, and Fairyland. Many of these bands play in the death metal, thrash metal and/or power metal styles.

France also has a large black metal movement, including, Belenos, Deathspell Omega, Nocturnal Depression, Blut Aus Nord, Peste Noire, Vorkreist, Arkhon Infaustus, Merrimack and Antaeus, and the organization known as Les Légions Noires made up of such bands as Mütiilation, Vlad Tepes and Torgeist. The &#x27;shoegaze&#x27; black metal movement also has many bands hailing from France, such as Alcest, Les Discrets and Amesoeurs.

===Electronic===


Electronic music, as exemplified by Jean Michel Jarre and Cerrone, achieved a wide French audience. The French electro-pop duos Air and Daft Punk and techno artists Laurent Garnier and David Guetta found a wide audience in the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century, both locally and internationally. Groups such as Justice, M83, Phoenix, Télépopmusik and Klingande continue to enjoy success.

===Dance===

French house is a late 1990s form of house music, part of the 1990s and first decade of the 21st-century European dance music scene and the latest form of Euro disco. The genre is also known as &quot;Disco house&quot;, &quot;Neu-disco&quot; (new disco), &quot;French touch&quot;, &quot;filter house&quot; or &quot;tekfunk&quot;. The early mid/late 1990s productions was notable for the &quot;filter effect&quot; used by artists such as Daft Punk. Other productions use more mainstream vocals and samples.
French house is greatly influenced by the 1970s Euro disco and especially the short lived space disco music style (a European (mostly French) variation of Hi-NRG disco), and also by P-Funk and the productions of Thomas Bangalter.

The first French house experiments (at the time called &quot;disco house&quot; and &quot;neu disco&quot;) became notable in the international market between 1997 and 1999. Daft Punk, Stardust and Cassius were the first international successful artists of the genre and their videos show their &quot;space disco&quot; roots.

Several artists played important roles in popularizing the genre, which, in 2000, achieved international success. Bob Sinclar&#x27;s single &quot;I Feel For You&quot; charted in several countries, including Germany, Italy, and Spain. Etienne de Crécy&#x27;s album &quot;Tempovision&quot; charted at #57 in France and included the successful single &quot;Am I Wrong.&quot; In September, the French house group Modjo released &quot;Lady (Hear Me Tonight), which debuted at #1 in the UK and became a top-ten hit in thirteen countries. Galleon followed the next year.

Today most French house bands and artists have moved on to other music styles, notably a French variation of electro, that is danced on the milky way/Tecktonik style.

===Disco===
The Village People, co-founded by the two French composers Jacques Morali and Henri Belolo, was a major international disco group. Notable French disco singers also include Dalida, Sheila and B. Devotion, Ottawan, Voyage, Cerrone, Patrick Hernandez and F.R. David, respectively known for their worldwide hits &quot;Monday, Tuesday... Laissez-moi danser&quot; (1979), &quot;Spacer&quot; (1979), &quot;D.I.S.C.O.&quot; (1979), &quot;You&#x27;re OK / T&#x27;es OK&quot; (1980), &quot;Souvenirs&quot; (1978), &quot;Supernature&quot; (1977), &quot;Born to Be Alive&quot; (1979) and &quot;Words&quot; (1982).

===Hip-Hop===
Hip hop music was exported to France in the 1980s, and French rappers and DJs such as David Guetta and MC Solaar, also had some success. Hip hop music came from New York City, invented in the 1970s by African Americans. By 1983, the genre had spread to much of the world, including France. Almost immediately, French performers (musicians and breakdancers) began their career, including Max-Laure Bourjolly and Traction Avant. Popularity was brief, however, and hip hop quickly receded to the French underground. Hip-hop was adapted to French context, especially the poverty of large cities known as banlieues (&quot;suburbs&quot;) where many French of foreign descent live, especially from the former colonial countries (West Africa and Caribbean). If there is some influence of African musics and of course American hip hop, French hip-hop is also strongly connected to French music, with strong reciprocal influences, from French pop and chanson, both in music and lyrics.

&quot;Paname City Rappin&quot; (1984, by Dee Nasty) was the first album released, and the first major stars were IAM, Suprême NTM and MC Solaar, whose 1991 &quot;Qui Sème le Vent Récolte le Tempo&quot;, was a major hit. Through the nineties, the music grew to become one of the most popular genres in France with huge success of the pioneers (IAM, Suprême NTM) and newcomers (Ministère Amer, Oxmo Puccino, Lunatic). France is the world&#x27;s second-largest hip-hop market. The most popular rappers of the 2000s are Diam&#x27;s, Booba and Kenza Farah with successful artists more underground such as La Rumeur, la Caution and TTC.

==Overseas music==

===French Polynesia===

===Réunion island===

Maloya music has a strong African element reflected in the use of slave chants and work songs. The most popular sega musicians include Danyèl Waro, Firmin Viry, Granmoun Lélé, Mars tou sèl.

===Martinique and Guadeloupe===
;Zouk
Zouk is a fast jump-up carnival beat originating from the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, popularized by the French Antillean band Kassav&#x27; in the 1980s. Very rapid in tempo, the style lost ground in the 1980s due to the strong presence of kadans or compas, the main music of the French Antilles. Today, zouk is the French Antilles compas, also called zouk-love
In Africa, Kassav&#x27;s zouk and the Haitian compas they featured, gained popularity in francophone and lusophone countries. It is also particularly popular in North America in the Canadian province of Quebec.

;Bouyon
Bouyon (Boo-Yon) is a form of popular music of Dominica, also known as jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The best-known band in the genre is Windward Caribbean Kulture (WCK), who originated the style in 1988.
Over the years, thanks to inter-trade with the Dominicans and the mass participation of Guadeloupe at the World Creole Music Festival, the flagship group as Triple kay and MFR band began to democratize and local artists were inducted including the remix Allo Triple kay with Daly and &quot;Big Ting Poppin &#x27;Daly alone.
A popular offshoot within the bouyon is called bouyon hardcore, a style characterized by its lewd and violent lyrics. Popular Bouyon gwada musicians include, Wee Low, Suppa, Doc J, Yellow gaza, etc.

;Antilles hip hop
The French Antilles hip hop is a style of hip hop music originating from the French departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean. Usually in French and Antillean creole, the French Antilles hip hop is most popular in the French Antilles and France.

;Rock In Gwada
Although a minority genre, French Antilles rock groups participate in the broadening of the Caribbean musical spectrum. The spearheads like The Bolokos or Livestocks include themes, rhythms or Caribbean melodies on British or American influences. The &quot;Rock In Gwada&quot; collective brings together some of these groups whose first festival took place in Petit-Bourg in 2016.

==International music==

French language is spoken worldwide and many international artists contribute to French music.

===Europe===

The greatest Belgian chansonnier was Jacques Brel, whose classic songs have been covered by several international artists. Others such as Salvatore Adamo, Axelle Red, Lara Fabian, Maurane, Selah Sue, Frédéric François and Annie Cordy have also enjoyed some success in France and other French-speaking countries.

===North America===
Quebec singers are very popular in France, and both nations have influenced each other in terms of music styles. Quebec artists have been taking the French stage quite extensively. Notable singers that have performed in France included: Céline Dion, Diane Tell, Cœur de pirate, Garou, Isabelle Boulay, Lynda Lemay and many others. Roch Voisine and Natasha St-Pier, who are of Acadian heritage, reached the top of charts in France with their famous songs &quot;Hélène&quot; (1989) and &quot;Tu trouveras&quot; (2002). Rock singer Avril Lavigne, whose father is of French origin (born in Lorraine), is also popular in France, and she obtained her French passport and citizenship in 2011. Salvatore Adamo and Charles Aznavour are widely recognized in America

===Asia===
One of the most famous French-speaking Asian artists is Anggun, a French-naturalised singer from Indonesia, best known for her single &quot;La Neige au Sahara&quot; (Snow on the Sahara) written by Erick Benzi. The song was released in 1997 as her debut international single in 33 countries worldwide, and made the charts in Europe (#1 in Italy), America (#16 in USA Billboard), and Asia (#1 in Indonesia, #3 in Malaysia). French music also found surprising favorable reception in Japan, where the language and culture from France is often seen as romantic. Some Japanese groups use the French language, such as Malice Mizer or Versailles, named after the Château de Versailles. Charles Aznavour and Mireille Mathieu are widely recognized in Japan.

===Africa===
Beginning in the 1920s, Raï music developed in Algeria as a combination of rural and urban music. Often viewed as a form of resistance towards censorship, many of the conventional values of the old raï became modernized with instruments, synthesizers and modern equipment. Later performers added influences from funk, hip hop, rock and other styles, creating most notably a pop genre called lover&#x27;s raï. Performers include Rachid Taha and Faudel. Originating of the city of Oran, raï shot to the top of the French, Swiss and Dutch charts in 1992 with the release of Khaled&#x27;s single &quot;Didi&quot;.

<doc id="244705" wikidata="Q1479613" url="?curid=244705" title="Weil conjectures">
<text>In mathematics, the Weil conjectures were highly influential proposals by . They led to a successful multi-decade program to prove them, in which many leading researchers developed the framework of modern algebraic geometry and number theory.

The conjectures concern the generating functions (known as local zeta functions) derived from counting points on algebraic varieties over finite fields. A variety over a finite field with elements has a finite number of rational points (with coordinates in the original field), as well as points with coordinates in any finite extension of the original field. The generating function has coefficients derived from the numbers of points over the extension field with elements.

Weil conjectured that such &quot;zeta functions&quot; for smooth varieties are rational functions, satisfy a certain functional equation, and have their zeros in restricted places. The last two parts were consciously modelled on the Riemann zeta function, a kind of generating function for prime integers, which obeys a functional equation and (conjecturally) has its zeros restricted by the Riemann hypothesis. The rationality was proved by , the functional equation by , and the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis by .

==Background and history==
The earliest antecedent of the Weil conjectures is by Carl Friedrich Gauss and appears in section VII of his &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; , concerned with roots of unity and Gaussian periods. In article 358, he moves on from the periods that build up towers of quadratic extensions, for the construction of regular polygons; and assumes that is a prime number congruent to 1 modulo 3. Then there is a cyclic cubic field inside the cyclotomic field of th roots of unity, and a normal integral basis of periods for the integers of this field (an instance of the Hilbert–Speiser theorem). Gauss constructs the order-3 periods, corresponding to the cyclic group of non-zero residues modulo under multiplication and its unique subgroup of index three. Gauss lets formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 be its cosets. Taking the periods (sums of roots of unity) corresponding to these cosets applied to , he notes that these periods have a multiplication table that is accessible to calculation. Products are linear combinations of the periods, and he determines the coefficients. He sets, for example, formula_4 equal to the number of elements of which are in formula_1 and which, after being increased by one, are also in formula_1. He proves that this number and related ones are the coefficients of the products of the periods. To see the relation of these sets to the Weil conjectures, notice that if and are both in formula_1, then there exist and in such that and ; consequently, . Therefore formula_4 is related to the number of solutions to in the finite field . The other coefficients have similar interpretations. Gauss&#x27;s determination of the coefficients of the products of the periods therefore counts the number of points on these elliptic curves, and as a byproduct he proves the analog of the Riemann hypothesis.

The Weil conjectures in the special case of algebraic curves were conjectured by . The case of curves over finite fields was proved by Weil, finishing the project started by Hasse&#x27;s theorem on elliptic curves over finite fields. Their interest was obvious enough from within number theory: they implied upper bounds for exponential sums, a basic concern in analytic number theory .

What was really eye-catching, from the point of view of other mathematical areas, was the proposed connection with algebraic topology. Given that finite fields are &quot;discrete&quot; in nature, and topology speaks only about the &quot;continuous&quot;, the detailed formulation of Weil (based on working out some examples) was striking and novel. It suggested that geometry over finite fields should fit into well-known patterns relating to Betti numbers, the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem and so on.

The analogy with topology suggested that a new homological theory be set up applying within algebraic geometry. This took two decades (it was a central aim of the work and school of Alexander Grothendieck) building up on initial suggestions from Serre. The rationality part of the conjectures was proved first by , using -adic methods. and his collaborators established the rationality conjecture, the functional equation and the link to Betti numbers by using the properties of étale cohomology, a new cohomology theory developed by Grothendieck and Michael Artin for attacking the Weil conjectures, as outlined in . 
Of the four conjectures, the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was the hardest to prove. Motivated by the proof of of an analogue of the Weil conjectures for Kähler manifolds, Grothendieck envisioned a proof based on his standard conjectures on algebraic cycles . However, Grothendieck&#x27;s standard conjectures remain open (except for the hard Lefschetz theorem, which was proved by Deligne by extending his work on the Weil conjectures), and the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was proved by , using the étale cohomology theory but circumventing the use of standard conjectures by an ingenious argument.

 found and proved a generalization of the Weil conjectures, bounding the weights of the pushforward of a sheaf.

==Statement of the Weil conjectures==

Suppose that is a non-singular -dimensional projective algebraic variety over the field with elements. The zeta function of is by definition

:formula_9

where is the number of points of defined over the degree extension of .

The Weil conjectures state:

:1. (Rationality) is a &quot;rational function&quot; of . More precisely, can be written as a finite alternating product
:::formula_10
::where each is an integral polynomial. Furthermore, , , and for , factors over as formula_11 for some numbers .
:2. (Functional equation and Poincaré duality) The zeta function satisfies
:::formula_12
::or equivalently
:::formula_13
::where is the Euler characteristic of . In particular, for each , the numbers , , ... equal the numbers , , ... in some order.
:3. (Riemann hypothesis) for all and all . This implies that all zeros of lie on the &quot;critical line&quot; of complex numbers with real part .
:4. (Betti numbers) If is a (good) &quot;reduction mod&quot; of a non-singular projective variety defined over a number field embedded in the field of complex numbers, then the degree of is the th Betti number of the space of complex points of .

==Examples==

===The projective line===
The simplest example (other than a point) is to take to be the projective line. The number of points of over a field with elements is just (where the &quot;&quot; comes from the &quot;point at infinity&quot;). The zeta function is just

:formula_14

It is easy to check all parts of the Weil conjectures directly. For example, the corresponding complex variety is the Riemann sphere and its initial Betti numbers are 1, 0, 1.

===Projective space===
It is not much harder to do -dimensional projective space. The number of points of over a field with elements is just . The zeta function is just

:formula_15

It is again easy to check all parts of the Weil conjectures directly. (Complex projective space gives the relevant Betti numbers, which nearly determine the answer.)

The number of points on the projective line and projective space are so easy to calculate because they can be written as disjoint unions of a finite number of copies of affine spaces. It is also easy to prove the Weil conjectures for other spaces, such as Grassmannians and flag varieties, which have the same &quot;paving&quot; property.

===Elliptic curves===
These give the first non-trivial cases of the Weil conjectures (proved by Hasse). If is an elliptic curve over a finite field with elements, then the number of points of defined over the field with elements is , where and are complex conjugates with absolute value .
The zeta function is

:formula_16

The Betti numbers are given by the torus, 1,2,1, and the numerator is a quadratic.

===Hyperelliptic curves===

As an example, consider the hyperelliptic curve
: formula_17
which is of genus formula_18 and dimension formula_19. At first viewed as a curve formula_20 defined over the rational numbers formula_21, this curve has &quot;good reduction&quot; at all primes formula_22. So, after reduction modulo formula_23, one obtains a hyperelliptic curve formula_24 of genus 2, with formula_25. Taking formula_26 as an example, the Weil polynomials formula_27, formula_28 and the zeta function of formula_29 assume the form
:formula_30
The values formula_31 and formula_32 can be determined by counting the numbers of solutions formula_33 of formula_34 over formula_35 and formula_36, respectively, and adding 1 to each of these two numbers to allow for the point at infinity formula_37. This counting yields formula_38 and formula_39. It follows:

:formula_40   and
:formula_41
The zeros of formula_42 are formula_43 and formula_44 (the decimal expansions of these real and imaginary parts are cut off after the fifth decimal place) together with their complex conjugates formula_45 and formula_46. So, in the factorisation formula_47, we have formula_48 . As stated in the third part (Riemann hypothesis) of the Weil conjectures, formula_49 for formula_50.

The non-singular, projective, complex manifold that belongs to formula_20 has the Betti numbers formula_52. As described in part four of the Weil conjectures, the (topologically defined!) Betti numbers coincide with the degrees of the Weil polynomials formula_27, for all primes formula_54: formula_55.

=== Abelian surfaces===
An Abelian surface is a two-dimensional Abelian variety. This is, they are projective varieties that also have the structure of a group, in a way that is compatible with the group composition and taking inverses. Elliptic curves represent &quot;one&quot;-dimensional Abelian varieties. As an example of an Abelian surface defined over a finite field, consider the Jacobian variety formula_56 of the genus 2 curve 

:formula_57
which was introduced in the section on hyperelliptic curves. The dimension of formula_58 equals the genus of formula_59, so formula_60. There are algebraic integers formula_61 such that
# the polynomial formula_62 has coefficients in formula_63;
# formula_64 for all formula_65; and
# formula_66 for formula_67.
The zeta-function of formula_58 is given by
:formula_69
where formula_26, formula_71, and formula_72 represents the complex variable of the zeta-function. The Weil polynomials formula_27 have the following specific form : 
:formula_74
for formula_75, and
:formula_76 
is the same for the curve formula_59 (see section above) and its Jacobian variety formula_58. This is, the inverse roots of formula_27 are the products formula_80 that consist of formula_81 many, different inverse roots of formula_42. Hence, all coefficients of the polynomials formula_27 can be expressed as polynomial functions of the parameters formula_31, formula_32 and formula_26 appearing in formula_87 Calculating these polynomial functions for the coefficients of the formula_27 shows that
:formula_89
Polynomial formula_90 allows for calculating the numbers of elements of the Jacobian variety formula_91 over the finite field formula_35 and its field extension formula_36:

:formula_94
The inverses formula_95 of the zeros of formula_27 do have the expected absolute value of formula_97 (Riemann hypothesis). Moreover, the maps formula_98 formula_99 correlate the inverses of the zeros of formula_27 and the inverses of the zeros of formula_101. A non-singular, complex, projective, algebraic variety formula_102 with &quot;good&quot; reduction at the prime 41 to formula_103 &quot;must&quot; have Betti numbers formula_104, since these are the degrees of the polynomials formula_105
The Euler characteristic formula_106 of formula_58 is given by the alternating sum of these degrees/Betti numbers: formula_108.

By taking the logarithm of

:formula_109
it follows that
:formula_110

Aside from the values formula_111 and formula_112 already known, you can read off from this Taylor series all other numbers formula_113, formula_65, of formula_115-rational elements of the Jacobian variety, defined over formula_35, of the curve formula_29: for instance, formula_118 and formula_119. In doing so, formula_120 always implies formula_121 since then, formula_122 is a subgroup of formula_123.

==Weil cohomology==
Weil suggested that the conjectures would follow from the existence of a suitable &quot;Weil cohomology theory&quot; for varieties over finite fields, similar to the usual cohomology with rational coefficients for complex varieties. His idea was that if is the Frobenius automorphism over the finite field, then the number of points of the variety over the field of order is the number of fixed points of (acting on all points of the variety defined over the algebraic closure). In algebraic topology the number of fixed points of an automorphism can be worked out using the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem, given as an alternating sum of traces on the cohomology groups. So if there were similar cohomology groups for varieties over finite fields, then the zeta function could be expressed in terms of them.

The first problem with this is that the coefficient field for a Weil cohomology theory cannot be the rational numbers. To see this consider the case of a supersingular elliptic curve over a finite field of characteristic . The endomorphism ring of this is an order in a quaternion algebra over the rationals, and should act on the first cohomology group, which should be a 2-dimensional vector space over the coefficient field by analogy with the case of a complex elliptic curve. However a quaternion algebra over the rationals cannot act on a 2-dimensional vector space over the rationals. The same argument eliminates the possibility of the coefficient field being the reals or the -adic numbers, because the quaternion algebra is still a division algebra over these fields. However it does not eliminate the possibility that the coefficient field is the field of -adic numbers for some prime , because over these fields the division algebra splits and becomes a matrix algebra, which can act on a 2-dimensional vector space. Grothendieck and Michael Artin managed to construct suitable cohomology theories over the field of -adic numbers for each prime , called -adic cohomology.

==Grothendieck&#x27;s proofs of three of the four conjectures==
By the end of 1964 Grothendieck together with Artin and Jean-Louis Verdier (and the earlier 1960 work by Dwork) proved the Weil conjectures apart from the most difficult third conjecture above (the &quot;Riemann hypothesis&quot; conjecture) (Grothendieck 1965). The general theorems about étale cohomology allowed Grothendieck to prove an analogue of the Lefschetz fixed-point formula for the &quot;ℓ&quot;-adic cohomology theory, and by applying it to the Frobenius automorphism &quot;F&quot; he was able to prove the conjectured formula for the zeta function:
:formula_124
where each polynomial &quot;P&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the determinant of &quot;I&quot; − &quot;TF&quot; on the &quot;ℓ&quot;-adic cohomology group &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;.

The rationality of the zeta function follows immediately. The functional equation for the zeta function follows from Poincaré duality for &quot;ℓ&quot;-adic cohomology, and the relation with complex Betti numbers of a lift follows from a comparison theorem between &quot;ℓ&quot;-adic and ordinary cohomology for complex varieties.

More generally, Grothendieck proved a similar formula for the zeta function (or &quot;generalized L-function&quot;) of a sheaf &quot;F&quot;0:
:formula_125
as a product over cohomology groups:
:formula_126
The special case of the constant sheaf gives the usual zeta function.

==Deligne&#x27;s first proof of the Riemann hypothesis conjecture==
, , and gave expository accounts of the first proof of . Much of the background in &quot;ℓ&quot;-adic cohomology is described in .

Deligne&#x27;s first proof of the remaining third Weil conjecture (the &quot;Riemann hypothesis conjecture&quot;) used the following steps:

===Use of Lefschetz pencils===
*Grothendieck expressed the zeta function in terms of the trace of Frobenius on &quot;ℓ&quot;-adic cohomology groups, so the Weil conjectures for a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional variety &quot;V&quot; over a finite field with &quot;q&quot; elements depend on showing that the eigenvalues &quot;α&quot; of Frobenius acting on the &quot;i&quot;th &quot;ℓ&quot;-adic cohomology group &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) of &quot;V&quot; have absolute values  = &quot;q&quot;&quot;i&quot;/2 (for an embedding of the algebraic elements of Q&quot;ℓ&quot; into the complex numbers).
*After blowing up &quot;V&quot; and extending the base field, one may assume that the variety &quot;V&quot; has a morphism onto the projective line P1, with a finite number of singular fibers with very mild (quadratic) singularities. The theory of monodromy of Lefschetz pencils, introduced for complex varieties (and ordinary cohomology) by , and extended by and to &quot;ℓ&quot;-adic cohomology, relates the cohomology of &quot;V&quot; to that of its fibers. The relation depends on the space &quot;E&quot;&quot;x&quot; of vanishing cycles, the subspace of the cohomology &quot;H&quot;&quot;d&quot;−1(&quot;V&quot;&quot;x&quot;) of a non-singular fiber &quot;V&quot;&quot;x&quot;, spanned by classes that vanish on singular fibers.
*The Leray spectral sequence relates the middle cohomology group of &quot;V&quot; to the cohomology of the fiber and base. The hard part to deal with is more or less a group &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;P&quot;1, &quot;j&quot;*&quot;E&quot;) = &quot;H&quot;(&quot;U&quot;,&quot;E&quot;), where &quot;U&quot; is the points the projective line with non-singular fibers, and &quot;j&quot; is the inclusion of &quot;U&quot; into the projective line, and &quot;E&quot; is the sheaf with fibers the spaces &quot;E&quot;&quot;x&quot; of vanishing cycles.

===The key estimate===
The heart of Deligne&#x27;s proof is to show that the sheaf &quot;E&quot; over &quot;U&quot; is pure, in other words to find the absolute values of the eigenvalues of Frobenius on its stalks. This is done by studying the zeta functions of the even powers &quot;E&quot;&quot;k&quot; of &quot;E&quot; and applying Grothendieck&#x27;s formula for the zeta functions as alternating products over cohomology groups. The crucial idea of considering even &quot;k&quot; powers of &quot;E&quot; was inspired by the paper , who used a similar idea with &quot;k&quot; = 2 for bounding the Ramanujan tau function. pointed out that a generalization of Rankin&#x27;s result for higher even values of &quot;k&quot; would imply the Ramanujan conjecture, and Deligne realized that in the case of zeta functions of varieties, Grothendieck&#x27;s theory of zeta functions of sheaves provided an analogue of this generalization.
*The poles of the zeta function of &quot;E&quot;&quot;k&quot; are found using Grothendieck&#x27;s formula
::formula_127
:and calculating the cohomology groups in the denominator explicitly. The &quot;H&quot; term is usually just 1 as &quot;U&quot; is usually not compact, and the &quot;H&quot; can be calculated explicitly as follows. Poincaré duality relates &quot;H&quot;(&quot;E&quot;&quot;k&quot;) to &quot;H&quot;(&quot;E&quot;&quot;k&quot;), which is in turn the space of covariants of the monodromy group, which is the geometric fundamental group of &quot;U&quot; acting on the fiber of &quot;E&quot;&quot;k&quot; at a point. The fiber of &quot;E&quot; has a bilinear form induced by cup product, which is antisymmetric if &quot;d&quot; is even, and makes &quot;E&quot; into a symplectic space. (This is a little inaccurate: Deligne did later show that &quot;E&quot;∩&quot;E&quot;⊥ = 0 by using the hard Lefschetz theorem, this requires the Weil conjectures, and the proof of the Weil conjectures really has to use a slightly more complicated argument with &quot;E&quot;/&quot;E&quot;∩&quot;E&quot;⊥ rather than &quot;E&quot;.) An argument of Kazhdan and Margulis shows that the image of the monodromy group acting on &quot;E&quot;, given by the Picard–Lefschetz formula, is Zariski dense in a symplectic group and therefore has the same invariants, which are well known from classical invariant theory. Keeping track of the action of Frobenius in this calculation shows that its eigenvalues are all &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;d&quot;−1)/2+1, so the zeta function of &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;E&quot;&quot;k&quot;,&quot;T&quot;) has poles only at &quot;T&quot; = 1/&quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;d&quot;−1)/2+1.
*The Euler product for the zeta function of &quot;E&quot;&quot;k&quot; is
::formula_128
:If &quot;k&quot; is even then all the coefficients of the factors on the right (considered as power series in &quot;T&quot;) are non-negative; this follows by writing
::formula_129
:and using the fact that the traces of powers of &quot;F&quot; are rational, so their &quot;k&quot; powers are non-negative as &quot;k&quot; is even. Deligne proves the rationality of the traces by relating them to numbers of points of varieties, which are always (rational) integers.
*The powers series for &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;E&quot;&quot;k&quot;, &quot;T&quot;) converges for &quot;T&quot; less than the absolute value 1/&quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;d&quot;−1)/2+1 of its only possible pole. When &quot;k&quot; is even the coefficients of all its Euler factors are non-negative, so that each of the Euler factors has coefficients bounded by a constant times the coefficients of &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;E&quot;&quot;k&quot;, &quot;T&quot;) and therefore converges on the same region and has no poles in this region. So for &quot;k&quot; even the polynomials &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;T&quot;) have no zeros in this region, or in other words the eigenvalues of Frobenius on the stalks of &quot;E&quot;&quot;k&quot; have absolute value at most &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;d&quot;−1)/2+1.
*This estimate can be used to find the absolute value of any eigenvalue &quot;α&quot; of Frobenius on a fiber of &quot;E&quot; as follows. For any integer &quot;k&quot;, &quot;α&quot;&quot;k&quot; is an eigenvalue of Frobenius on a stalk of &quot;E&quot;&quot;k&quot;, which for &quot;k&quot; even is bounded by &quot;q&quot;1+&quot;k&quot;(&quot;d&quot;−1)/2. So
::formula_130
:As this is true for arbitrarily large even &quot;k&quot;, this implies that
::formula_131
:Poincaré duality then implies that
::formula_132

===Completion of the proof===
The deduction of the Riemann hypothesis from this estimate is mostly a fairly straightforward use of standard techniques and is done as follows.
*The eigenvalues of Frobenius on &quot;H&quot;(&quot;U&quot;,&quot;E&quot;) can now be estimated as they are the zeros of the zeta function of the sheaf &quot;E&quot;. This zeta function can be written as an Euler product of zeta functions of the stalks of &quot;E&quot;, and using the estimate for the eigenvalues on these stalks shows that this product converges for  &lt; &quot;q&quot;−&quot;d&quot;/2−1/2, so that there are no zeros of the zeta function in this region. This implies that the eigenvalues of Frobenius on &quot;E&quot; are at most &quot;q&quot;&quot;d&quot;/2+1/2 in absolute value (in fact it will soon be seen that they have absolute value exactly &quot;q&quot;&quot;d&quot;/2). This step of the argument is very similar to the usual proof that the Riemann zeta function has no zeros with real part greater than 1, by writing it as an Euler product.
*The conclusion of this is that the eigenvalues &quot;α&quot; of the Frobenius of a variety of even dimension &quot;d&quot; on the middle cohomology group satisfy
::formula_133
:To obtain the Riemann hypothesis one needs to eliminate the 1/2 from the exponent. This can be done as follows. Applying this estimate to any even power &quot;V&quot;&quot;k&quot; of &quot;V&quot; and using the Künneth formula shows that the eigenvalues of Frobenius on the middle cohomology of a variety &quot;V&quot; of any dimension &quot;d&quot; satisfy
::formula_134
:As this is true for arbitrarily large even &quot;k&quot;, this implies that
::formula_135
:Poincaré duality then implies that
::formula_136
*This proves the Weil conjectures for the middle cohomology of a variety. The Weil conjectures for the cohomology below the middle dimension follow from this by applying the weak Lefschetz theorem, and the conjectures for cohomology above the middle dimension then follow from Poincaré duality.

==Deligne&#x27;s second proof==
 found and proved a generalization of the Weil conjectures, bounding the weights of the pushforward of a sheaf. In practice it is this generalization rather than the original Weil conjectures that is mostly used in applications, such as the hard Lefschetz theorem. Much of the second proof is a rearrangement of the ideas of his first proof. The main extra idea needed is an argument closely related to the theorem of Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée Poussin, used by Deligne to show that various &quot;L&quot;-series do not have zeros with real part 1.

A constructible sheaf on a variety over a finite field is called pure of weight &quot;β&quot; if for all points &quot;x&quot; the eigenvalues of the Frobenius at &quot;x&quot; all have absolute value &quot;N&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;β&quot;/2, and is called mixed of weight ≤ &quot;β&quot; if it can be written as repeated extensions by pure sheaves with weights ≤ &quot;β&quot;.

Deligne&#x27;s theorem states that if &quot;f&quot; is a morphism of schemes of finite type over a finite field, then &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;f&quot;! takes mixed sheaves of weight ≤ &quot;β&quot; to mixed sheaves of weight ≤ &quot;β&quot; + &quot;i&quot;.

The original Weil conjectures follow by taking &quot;f&quot; to be a morphism from a smooth projective variety to a point and considering the constant sheaf Q&quot;ℓ&quot; on the variety. This gives an upper bound on the absolute values of the eigenvalues of Frobenius, and Poincaré duality then shows that this is also a lower bound.

In general &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;f&quot;! does not take pure sheaves to pure sheaves. However it does when a suitable form of Poincaré duality holds, for example if &quot;f&quot; is smooth and proper, or if one works with perverse sheaves rather than sheaves as in .

Inspired by the work of on Morse theory, found another proof, using Deligne&#x27;s &quot;ℓ&quot;-adic Fourier transform, which allowed him to simplify Deligne&#x27;s proof by avoiding the use of the method of Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin. His proof generalizes the classical calculation of the absolute value of Gauss sums using the fact that the norm of a Fourier transform has a simple relation to the norm of the original function. used Laumon&#x27;s proof as the basis for their exposition of Deligne&#x27;s theorem. gave a further simplification of Laumon&#x27;s proof, using monodromy in the spirit of Deligne&#x27;s first proof. gave another proof using the Fourier transform, replacing etale cohomology with rigid cohomology.

<text>The Anaheim Amigos were a charter member American Basketball Association (ABA) team based in Southern California. After their first season in Anaheim, the team moved to Los Angeles to become the Los Angeles Stars. In 1970, it moved to Salt Lake City and became the Utah Stars.

The Amigos were the first professional team in any sport to bill themselves as representing the city of Anaheim, California, and were the only team to do so until the National Hockey League&#x27;s Mighty Ducks of Anaheim began play in 1993. The California Angels of Major League Baseball played at Anaheim Stadium during the Amigos&#x27; existence, but they would not use &quot;Anaheim&quot; in their name until 1997.

==Franchise history==

===Origins===
With the founding of the ABA on February 2, 1967, a charter franchise in Anaheim was awarded to Art Kim and James Ackerman for $30,000. A &#x27;name the team&#x27; contest resulted in the Amigos name. The team played most of its home games at the Anaheim Convention Center. Five home games were scheduled elsewhere in California and three home games were scheduled in Honolulu, Hawaii. Al Brightman was the first head coach.
===1967–68 season===

The Amigos&#x27; roster was highlighted by guards Les Selvage, Jeff Congdon and Steve Chubin, former NBA player Ben Warley and 7 foot center Larry Bunce. Chubin led the team in scoring and assists and was a fan favorite. Selvage led the league in three-point field goal attempts. Warley led the team in rebounds and was an effective outside shooter. Congdon played well but was traded in mid-season to the Denver Rockets for Willis Thomas. Bunce did not live up to expectations despite his height, but played in the 1968 ABA All-Star Game, as did Warley.

The Amigos were not successful on the court. They lost their first five games, including the first ever ABA game, a 134–129 loss to the Oakland Oaks on the road. After losing two thirds of their first 36 games Brightman was fired and replaced as head coach by Harry Dinnel. During the season the Amigos lost eight straight games in one stretch and had two other stretches of six losses each. The team finished the season with 25 wins and 53 losses, good for fifth place in Western Division but not good enough to make the playoffs.

===Move to Los Angeles===

The Amigos suffered from poor attendance. They averaged 1,293 fans per home game and their games were broadcast on radio and sometimes on television. However, they lost approximately $500,000 on the season and were sold for $450,000 to James J. Kirst who moved the team to nearby Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, where they became the Stars. Kirst also brought in Bill Sharman as the new head coach. Sharman had just completed two years coaching the NBA&#x27;s San Francisco Warriors, taking them to the playoffs both years. With Sharman associated with the team, they were able to sign 13 of their top 15 draft picks including All-Americans Larry Miller and Merv Jackson. Playing with a roster that contained 8 rookies, Los Angeles finished in 5th place and failed to make the playoffs in 1968–69.
1969-70 started out a little better for the Stars with some new veterans joining the best of the previous seasons returning players, but the team was still out of the playoff picture on March 5 when they were sold to cable television entrepreneur Bill Daniels. Following the sale the team came alive, making the playoffs on the last day of the season. Despite a fourth-place finish, Sharman, George Stone, and Mack Calvin led the Stars to the Western Conference Championship. In the 1970 ABA Finals, despite being heavy underdogs, they then stretched the Indiana Pacers to a sixth game before losing.

===Move to Salt Lake City, Utah===
After the 1969–70 season, the franchise once again relocated, this time to Salt Lake City, and became the Utah Stars.

<text>The Utah Stars were an American Basketball Association (ABA) team based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Under head coach Bill Sharman the Stars were the first major professional basketball team to use a pre-game shootaround.

==History prior to moving to Utah (1967–1970)==
The team was founded as the Anaheim Amigos, a charter member of the ABA based in Anaheim, California. They played at the Anaheim Convention Center. The team&#x27;s colors were orange and black. The Anaheim Amigos were founded by Art Kim, a Hawaii native who had long been active in basketball as a player, Amateur Athletic Union administrator and owner. The Amigos lost the very first ABA game to Oakland, 132–129. They finished their first season with 25 wins and 53 losses, good for fifth place in the Western Division but not good enough to make the playoffs.

The Amigos lost $500,000 in their first season, largely due to poor attendance; they only averaged 1,500 fans per game in a 7,500-seat arena. Kim realized he did not have the resources to keep going and sold the team to construction company owner Jim Kirst, who moved the team as the Los Angeles Stars in 1968 and played at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena in Los Angeles. The franchise made an attempt to sign legendary center Wilt Chamberlain, but in the end he did not sign with the Stars. With 33 wins and 45 losses, the Stars improved from their first season but again finished fifth in the Western Division and did not make the playoffs.

In October 1969 the Stars signed Zelmo Beaty away from the NBA&#x27;s Atlanta Hawks, but Beaty had to sit out the season due to a one-year option held by the Hawks, which the Stars would not buy out for $75,000. First year players Mack Calvin and Willie Wise signed with the Stars. The Stars finished fourth in the Western Division with a record of 43–41, earning the first winning season in franchise history and a playoff berth. The Stars defeated the Dallas Chaparrals 4 games to 2 in the Western Division semifinals and bested the Denver Rockets 4 games to 1 in the semifinals before losing the ABA championship series 4 games to 2 to the Indiana Pacers. Kirst had not anticipated the fast turnaround, and did not book the Sports Arena for several dates. They had to play several first and second-round games in their old home in Anaheim, as well as at the Long Beach Sports Arena in Long Beach. This turned out to be their final game as the Los Angeles Stars.

===Move to Utah (1970–71)===
Despite a promising young roster, the Stars were more or less an afterthought in a market whose first choices were the Los Angeles Lakers and UCLA Bruins; they only averaged 2,500 fans per game. In March 1970, Kirst sold the team to Colorado cable TV pioneer Bill Daniels, who moved the team in June to Salt Lake City as the Utah Stars for the 1970–71 season. Zelmo Beaty suited up for the team and they finished second in the Western Division with their best record yet at , one game behind the Indiana Pacers.

The Stars swept the Texas Chaparrals in four games in the first round of the playoffs, beat Indiana in seven games in a fiercely contested semifinal series, and edged out the Kentucky Colonels in seven games for the ABA championship. To date, this is Utah&#x27;s only pro basketball championship.

===1971–72 season===

The Stars won their first division championship, winning the Western Division with a record of 60–24. The Stars defeated the Dallas Chaparrals 4 games to none in the Western Division semifinals before falling to the Indiana Pacers in the Western Division finals, 4 games to 3.

===1972–73 season===

The Stars hosted the ABA All Star Game and again won the Western Division with a record of 55–29. The Stars defeated the San Diego Conquistadors 4 games to none in the Western Division semifinals but lost in the Western Division finals 4 games to 2 to the Indiana Pacers.

===1973–1974 season===

In 1973–74 the Stars finished with a record of 51-33 and won first place in the ABA&#x27;s Western Division for the third straight year under new coach Joe Mullaney. It was the Stars&#x27; third straight Western Division title. In the playoffs the Stars again defeated the San Diego Conquistadors in the Western Division semifinals, this time 4 games to 2, and went on to defeat the Indiana Pacers 4 games to 3 in the Western Division finals to reach the ABA Finals for the 2nd time in four seasons. The Stars then lost the championship to the New York Nets 4 games to 1.

===1974–75 season===

This was the Stars&#x27; final full ABA season. Daniels was almost broke due to a series of failed business ventures and an unsuccessful run for governor of Colorado. One of the casualties of the team&#x27;s financial woes was Mullaney, who resigned after being told the team could not afford to meet his contract. Daniels sold the team to Salt Lake City businessman James A. Collier in August 1974, but Collier was forced to relinquish the team to Daniels two weeks later after missing a payment. The Stars made a high-profile personnel move that season by signing high school player Moses Malone to play for them. The Stars finished the season in fourth place in the Western Division and lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Denver Nuggets, 4 games to 1.

===1975–76 season===
During the preseason, the Stars (and the Virginia Squires) failed to make payments required as a guarantee for hosting the NBA&#x27;s Chicago Bulls in one of the common ABA vs. NBA preseason exhibition games. Daniels sold the team again to Snellen and Lyle Johnson in May, but they relinquished the team to Daniels just before the season after missing several payments.

However, Daniels was almost completely broke by this time. As a result, on December 2, 1975, the league canceled the Stars franchise for missing payroll. Four of their players (including Moses Malone) were sold to the Spirits of St. Louis, with Daniels getting a 10% minority stake in the Spirits as well. A fifth player was sold to the Virginia Squires. Daniels ultimately paid back all of the season ticket holders at eight percent interest.

The Stars are widely considered one of the most successful teams in ABA history. They were also known for having some of the best fan support in the ABA, even up until the team folded in 1975. From 1970 to 1975, the Stars went 265-171 (.608), which was the best winning percentage of any team that played more than one season in the league.

===Aftermath===

Despite the Stars&#x27; demise, Salt Lake City had proven it could support big-time professional basketball. With this in mind, in 1976 the owners of the Spirits of St. Louis announced that they were moving the team to Utah for the 1976–1977 ABA season, to play as the Utah Rockies. However, this was undone when the ABA–NBA merger closed in June 1976 and the Spirits and the Kentucky Colonels were the only two teams left out of the merged league. (The Virginia Squires were folded shortly after the end of the regular season due to their inability to make good on a required league assessment, though there was no chance of them being part of a merger deal in any event.)

Professional basketball finally returned to Salt Lake City when the NBA&#x27;s New Orleans Jazz relocated there in 1979. The Jazz have played in Salt Lake City ever since. Of the three ABA teams that were left out of the ABA–NBA merger, the Stars are the only one to have eventually been replaced by an NBA team.

==ABA championship==

In their first season in Salt Lake City, the Stars dominated their way to a 57–27 record and a 2nd-place finish in the Western Division standings, a game behind the Indiana Pacers. In the Western Division Semifinals, the Stars would go on to sweep the Texas Chaparrals and then stunned the Pacers in game 7 of the Western Division Finals, earning a spot in the ABA Championship.

The Stars would face the Kentucky Colonels in the ABA Championship. In game one a near-capacity crowd filed into the Salt Palace to watch the Stars defeat Kentucky 136–117. The Stars set an ABA Playoff record by scoring 50 points in the 2nd quarter. In game 2, the series continued its high scoring with the Stars beating Kentucky 138–125. The series shifted to Louisville and Kentucky took games 3 and 4, tying the series up at 2-2. The series then returned to Salt Lake City, where the Stars beat Kentucky 137–127, taking a 3–2 series lead. The Stars looked to wrap up the ABA Championship with a game 6 victory in Louisville. However Kentucky clawed their way to a 7th game, barely beating the Stars 105–102, sending the series to a decisive 7th game back in Salt Lake City.

With the ABA Championship on the line, an ABA record crowd of 13,260 packed into the Salt Palace to watch game 7 of the 1971 ABA Championship. The game remained close throughout, however the Stars pulled away late, winning the 1971 ABA Championship 131–121. 
As the game ended, hundreds of Stars fans rushed the court, lifting players onto their shoulders in a jubilant celebration. The actions were a total surprise to Stars officials, as they had not anticipated such a reaction from the fans.

==Utah Stars vs. NBA teams==

The ABA teams frequently played exhibition games in the preseason vs. NBA teams. While the ABA overall had a winning record vs. the NBA in head to head competition, the Stars had an overall record of 7–9 against NBA teams.

The Stars&#x27; first game against the NBA was a 96–89 loss at home to the New York Knicks on September 28, 1971. The Stars lost their first four games against NBA teams, earning their first win against that league with a win against the Seattle SuperSonics in Honolulu, Hawaii on September 24, 1972.

Other Stars wins against the NBA include defeating the Boston Celtics at home on October 4, 1973 (part of a double header in which 12,431 Utah fans also saw the ABA&#x27;s Denver Rockets defeat the NBA&#x27;s Phoenix Suns 113-111 prior to the Stars&#x27; win); a home win against the Kansas City-Omaha Kings on October 8, 1974; a home win against the SuperSonics on October 7, 1975; a win against the Kings on October 11, 1975, in Denver as part of a double header in which 17,018 fans saw the Denver Nuggets lose to the NBA&#x27;s Golden State Warriors 115–100); and a 118–108 road win against the SuperSonics in Seattle on October 15, 1975.

In the very last game ever played between ABA and NBA teams, the Stars defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 106–101 in Salt Lake City on October 21, 1975. (In the penultimate ABA vs. NBA matchup, the ABA&#x27;s Kentucky Colonels defeated the Washington Bullets 121-111 two nights prior.)

<text>The Carnival of the Animals () is a humorous musical suite of 14 movements, including &quot;The Swan&quot;, by the French composer Camille Saint-Saëns. About 25 minutes in duration, it was written for private performance by two pianos and chamber ensemble; Saint-Saëns prohibited public performance of the work during his lifetime, feeling that its frivolity would damage his standing as a serious composer. The suite was published in 1922, the year after his death. A public performance in the same year was greeted with enthusiasm, and it has remained among his most popular. It is less frequently performed with a full orchestral complement of strings.

Following a disastrous concert tour of Germany in 1885–86, Saint-Saëns withdrew to a small Austrian village, where he composed &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot; in February 1886. From the beginning he regarded the work as a piece of fun. On 9 February 1886 he wrote to his publishers Durand in Paris that he was composing a work for the coming Shrove Tuesday, and confessing that he knew he should be working on his Third Symphony, but that this work was &quot;such fun&quot; (). He had apparently intended to write the work for his students at the École Niedermeyer de Paris, but it was first performed at a private concert given by the cellist Charles Lebouc on 3 March 1886:
A few days later, a second performance was given at Émile Lemoine&#x27;s chamber music society La Trompette, followed by another at the home of Pauline Viardot with an audience including Franz Liszt, a friend of the composer, who had expressed a wish to hear the work. There were other performances, typically for the French mid-Lent festival of Mi-Carême. All those performances were semi-private, except for one at the Société des instruments à vent in April 1892, and &quot;often took place with the musicians wearing masks of the heads of the various animals they represented&quot;. Saint-Saëns was adamant that the work would not be published in his lifetime, seeing it as detracting from his &quot;serious&quot; composer image. He relented only for the famous cello solo &quot;The Swan&quot;, which forms the penultimate movement of the work, and which was published in 1887 in an arrangement by the composer for cello and solo piano (the original uses two pianos).

Saint-Saëns specified in his will that the work should be published posthumously. Following his death in December 1921 it was published by Durand in Paris in April 1922; the first public performance was given on 25 February 1922 by the Concerts Colonne, conducted by Gabriel Pierné. It was rapturously received. &quot;Le Figaro&quot; reported:
&quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot; has since become one of Saint-Saëns&#x27;s best-known works, played in the original version for eleven instruments, or more often with the full string section of an orchestra. Frequently a glockenspiel substitutes for the rare glass harmonica.

== Music ==
The suite is scored for two pianos, two violins, viola, cello, double bass, flute (and piccolo), clarinet (C and B), glass harmonica, and xylophone. There are fourteen movements, each representing a different animal or animals:

=== I. &quot;Introduction et marche royale du lion&quot; (Introduction and Royal March of the Lion) ===

Strings and two pianos: the introduction begins with the pianos playing a bold tremolo, under which the strings enter with a stately theme. The pianos play a pair of glissandos going in opposite directions to conclude the first part of the movement. The pianos then introduce a march theme that they carry through most of the rest of the introduction. The strings provide the melody, with the pianos occasionally taking low chromatic scales in octaves which suggest the roar of a lion, or high &quot;ostinatos&quot;. The two groups of instruments switch places, with the pianos playing a higher, softer version of the melody. The movement ends with a fortissimo note from all the instruments used in this movement.

=== II. &quot;Poules et coqs&quot; (Hens and Roosters) ===

Violins, viola, two pianos and clarinet: this movement is centered around a &quot;pecking&quot; theme played by the pianos and strings, reminiscent of chickens pecking at grain. The clarinet plays a small solo above the strings; the piano plays a very fast theme based on the rooster&#x27;s crowing cry.

=== III. &quot;Hémiones (animaux véloces)&quot; (Wild Asses (Swift Animals)) ===

Two pianos: the animals depicted here are quite obviously running, an image induced by the constant, feverishly fast up-and-down motion of both pianos playing figures in octaves. These are dziggetai, donkeys that come from Tibet and are known for their great speed.

=== IV. &quot;Tortues&quot; (Tortoises) ===

Strings and piano: a satirical movement which opens with a piano playing a pulsing triplet figure in the higher register. The strings play a slow rendition of the famous &quot;Galop infernal&quot; (commonly called the Can-can) from Offenbach&#x27;s comic opera &quot;Orphée aux enfers&quot; (Orpheus in the Underworld).

=== V. &quot;L&#x27;Éléphant&quot; (The Elephant) ===

Double bass and piano: this section is marked Allegro pomposo, the great caricature for an elephant. The piano plays a waltz-like triplet figure while the bass hums the melody beneath it. Like &quot;Tortues&quot;, this is also a musical joke—the thematic material is taken from the Scherzo from Mendelssohn&#x27;s incidental music to &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Dance of the Sylphs&quot; from &quot;The Damnation of Faust&quot;. The two themes were both originally written for high, lighter-toned instruments (flute and various other woodwinds, and violin, accordingly); the joke is that Saint-Saëns moves this to the lowest and heaviest-sounding instrument in the orchestra, the double bass.

=== VI. &quot;Kangourous&quot; (Kangaroos) ===

Two pianos: the main figure here is a pattern of &quot;hopping&quot; chords (made up of triads in various positions) preceded by grace notes in the right hand. When the chords ascend, they quickly get faster and louder, and when the chords descend, they quickly get slower and softer.

=== VII. &quot;Aquarium&quot; ===

Violins, viola, cello (string quartet), two pianos, flute, and glass harmonica. The melody is played by the flute, backed by the strings, and glass harmonica on top of tumultuous, glissando-like runs and arpeggios in pianos. These figures, plus the occasional glissando from the glass harmonica towards the end—often played on celesta or glockenspiel—are evocative of a peaceful, dimly lit aquarium.

=== VIII. &quot;Personnages à longues oreilles&quot; (Characters with Long Ears) ===

Two violins: this is the shortest of all the movements. The violins alternate playing high, loud notes and low, buzzing ones (in the manner of a donkey&#x27;s braying &quot;hee-haw&quot;).
Music critics have speculated that the movement is meant to compare music critics to braying donkeys.

=== IX. &quot;Le Coucou au fond des bois&quot; (The Cuckoo in the Depths of the Woods) ===

Two pianos and clarinet: the pianos play large, soft chords while the clarinet plays a single two-note ostinato; a C and an A, mimicking the call of a cuckoo bird. Saint-Saëns states in the original score that the clarinettist should be offstage.

=== X. &quot;Volière&quot; (Aviary) ===

Strings, pianos and flute: the high strings take on a background role, providing a buzz in the background that is reminiscent of the background noise of a jungle. The cellos and basses play a pickup cadence to lead into most of the measures. The flute takes the part of the bird, with a trilling tune that spans much of its range. The pianos provide occasional pings and trills of other birds in the background. The movement ends very quietly after a long ascending chromatic scale from the flute.

=== XI. &quot;Pianistes&quot; (Pianists) ===

Strings and two pianos: this humorous movement (satirizing pianists as animals) is a glimpse of what few audiences ever get to see: the pianists practicing their finger exercises and scales. The scales of C, D, D and E are covered. Each one starts with a trill on the first and second note, then proceeds in scales with a few changes in the rhythm. Transitions between keys are accomplished with a blasting chord from all the instruments between scales. In some performances, the later, more difficult, scales are deliberately played increasingly out of time. The original edition has a note by the editors instructing the players to imitate beginners and their awkwardness. After the four scales, the key changes back to C, where the pianos play a moderate speed trill-like pattern in thirds, in the style of Charles-Louis Hanon or Carl Czerny, while the strings play a small part underneath. This movement is unusual in that the last three blasted chords do not resolve the piece, but rather lead into the next movement.

=== XII. &quot;Fossiles&quot; (Fossils) ===
Strings, two pianos, clarinet, and xylophone: here, Saint-Saëns mimics his own composition, the &quot;Danse macabre&quot;, which makes heavy use of the xylophone to evoke the image of skeletons dancing, the bones clacking together to the beat. The musical themes from &quot;Danse macabre&quot; are also quoted; the xylophone and the violin play much of the melody, alternating with the piano and clarinet. Allusions to &quot;Ah! vous dirai-je, Maman&quot; (better known in the English-speaking world as &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot;), the French nursery rhymes &quot;Au clair de la lune&quot;, and &quot;J&#x27;ai du bon tabac&quot; (the second piano plays the same melody upside down [inversion]), the popular anthem &quot;Partant pour la Syrie&quot;, as well as the aria &quot;Una voce poco fa&quot; from Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; can also be heard. The musical joke in this movement, according to Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s narration on his recording of the work with the New York Philharmonic, is that the musical pieces quoted are the fossils of Saint-Saëns&#x27;s time.

=== XIII. &quot;Le cygne&quot; (The Swan) ===
Two pianos and cello: a slowly moving cello melody (which evokes the swan elegantly gliding over the water) is played over rippling sixteenths in one piano and rolled chords in the other.

A staple of the cello repertoire, this is one of the best-known movements of the suite, usually in the version for cello with solo piano which was the only publication from this suite in Saint-Saëns&#x27;s lifetime. 

A short ballet solo, &quot;The Dying Swan&quot;, was choreographed in 1905 by Mikhail Fokine to this movement and performed by Anna Pavlova, who gave some 4,000 performances of the dance and &quot;swept the world&quot;.

=== XIV. &quot;Final&quot; (Finale) ===

Full ensemble: the finale opens on the same trills in the pianos as in the introduction, but soon the wind instruments, the glass harmonica and the xylophone join in. The strings build the tension with a few low notes, leading to glissandi by the piano before the lively main melody is introduced. The Finale is somewhat reminiscent of an American carnival of the 19th century, with one piano always maintaining a bouncy eighth-note rhythm. Although the melody is relatively simple, the supporting harmonies are ornamented in the style that is typical of Saint-Saëns&#x27; compositions for piano -- dazzling scales, glissandi and trills. Many of the previous movements are quoted here from the introduction, the lion, the donkeys, hens, and kangaroos. The work ends with a series of six &quot;Hee Haws&quot; from the donkeys, as if to say that the donkey has the last laugh, before the final strong group of C major chords.

== Musical allusions ==
As the title suggests, the work is programmatical and zoological. It progresses from the first movement, &quot;&quot;, through portraits of elephants and donkeys (&quot;Personages with Long Ears&quot;) to a finale reprising many of the earlier motifs.

Several of the movements are of humorous intent:
* &#x27; uses the theme of Rameau&#x27;s harpsichord piece &#x27; (&quot;The Hen&quot;) from his Suite in G major, but in a less elegant mood.
* &quot;&quot; makes use of the well-known &quot;Galop infernal&quot; from Offenbach&#x27;s comic opera &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;, playing the usually breakneck-speed melody at a slow, drooping pace.
* &quot;&quot; uses a theme from Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Danse des sylphes&quot; (from his work &quot;The Damnation of Faust&quot;) played in a much lower register than usual as a double bass solo. The piece also quotes the Scherzo from Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.
* The &quot; section is thought to be directed at music critics: they are also supposedly the last animals heard during the finale, braying.
* &quot; depicts piano students labouring over their scales in Hanon- and Czerny-style exercises.
* &#x27; quotes Saint-Saëns&#x27;s own &#x27; as well as three nursery rhymes, , (Twinkle Twinkle Little Star) and , also the song &quot;Partant pour la Syrie&quot; and Rossini&#x27;s aria, &quot;Una voce poco fa&quot; from &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;.

== Verses ==
In 1949 Ogden Nash wrote a set of humorous verses to accompany each movement for a Columbia Masterworks recording of &quot;Carnival of the Animals&quot; conducted by Andre Kostelanetz. They were recited by Noël Coward; Kostelanetz and Coward performed the suite with Nash&#x27;s verses with the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall, New York, in 1956.

Nash&#x27;s verses, with their topical references (e.g. to President Truman&#x27;s piano playing) became dated, and later writers have written new words to accompany the suite, including Johnny Morris, Jeremy Nicholas, Jack Prelutsky, John Lithgow, and Michael Morpurgo, whose version was recorded in 2020.

== Recordings ==
Various recordings of the Carnival of the Animals have been created. Some notable ones are:
=== Alternative recordings ===
*In 1982, the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble recorded an arrangement for brass instruments by Peter Reeve.
*A parody of the work entitled &quot;Carnival of the Animals, Part Two&quot; was recorded by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic and Wendy Carlos in 1988, with new verses written by Yankovic about a different cast of animals such as the shark and the poodle.
*In 1993, an all-star cast recording was released on CD by Dove Audio performed by the Hollywood Chamber Orchestra conducted by Lalo Schifrin with all proceeds going to charity. Readers included Arte Johnson (&quot;Introduction&quot; and &quot;Finale&quot;), Charlton Heston (&quot;Royal March of The Lion&quot;), James Earl Jones (&quot;Hens and Roosters&quot;), Betty White (&quot;Wild Donkeys&quot;), Lynn Redgrave (&quot;Tortoises&quot;), William Shatner (&quot;The Elephant&quot;), Joan Rivers (&quot;Kangaroos&quot;), Ted Danson (&quot;Aquarium&quot;), Lily Tomlin (&quot;Characters with Long Ears&quot;), Deborah Raffin (&quot;The Cuckoo&quot;), Audrey Hepburn (&quot;Aviary&quot;), Dudley Moore (&quot;Pianists&quot;), Walter Matthau (&quot;Fossils&quot;) and Jaclyn Smith (&quot;The Swan&quot;).
*In 1996, a surf rock cover of &quot;Aquarium&quot; was used as the on-ride soundtrack of the original Space Mountain ride layout at Disneyland before its 2005 renovation. It featured guitar riffs by Dick Dale.
*The finale for the suite was used as music for one of the segments in the 1999 Disney film, &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;, performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In it, a slapstick flamingo plays with a yo-yo, much to the chagrin of the other flamingoes, who attempt to entice him into doing the same &quot;dull&quot; routine as them. Gail Niwa and Philip Sabransky are the featured pianists in this recording. James Earl Jones introduces the segment, as he is standing next to animator Eric Goldberg, who directed the segment. Jones discusses the &quot;drawing boards [which] have been the birthplace of some of the most beloved animal characters of all time&quot; and how the animation and music combine to answer &quot;that age old question&quot; about the relationship between man and nature. Then, in a comical turn, he is handed a piece of paper and reads &quot;that age old question: What would happen if you gave a yo-yo to a flock of flamingoes?&quot; before asking &quot;Who wrote this?&quot;
*For a ballet to Saint-Saëns&#x27;s suite, choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon and presented by New York City Ballet, John Lithgow wrote a narration. The storyline is that a mischievous boy slips away from his teacher during a trip to a museum of natural history and, once the museum is shut, sees all the people he knows transformed into animals. An audio recording was made in 2004 by members of Chamber Music Los Angeles, conducted by Bill Elliot, with the narration spoken by Lithgow.
*In 2021, the Los Angeles Philharmonic streamed the piece at the Hollywood Bowl with Yuja Wang and David Fung on piano, conducted by Gustavo Dudamel. Four animal folktales were narrated by El Sistema students from around the world - Martin (9), Arão (12), Afra (14), and Maya (8).
*In 2016, The Wiggles released &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot;, with narration written and performed by Simon Pryce and the music performed by the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra.
*In 2023, Chronatic Quartet released &quot;Karneval der Tiere&quot;, a crossover pop-rock-jazz arrangement by the Quartet&#x27;s pianist Benedikt ter Braak for violin, double bass, piano and drums (trap set).

<text>The Fifth Republic () is France&#x27;s current republican system of government. It was established on 4 October 1958 by Charles de Gaulle under the Constitution of the Fifth Republic.

The Fifth Republic emerged from the collapse of the Fourth Republic, replacing the former parliamentary republic with a semi-presidential (or dual-executive) system that split powers between a president as head of state and a prime minister as head of government. Charles de Gaulle, who was the first French president elected under the Fifth Republic in December 1958, believed in a strong head of state, which he described as embodying (&quot;the spirit of the nation&quot;). Under the fifth republic, the president has the right to dissolve the national assembly and hold new parliamentary elections. If the president has a majority in the national assembly, the president sets domestic policy and the prime minister puts it into practice. During a presidential mandate, the president can also change prime ministers and reshuffle the government. If there is a different majority in the national assembly, the president is forced to nominate a prime minister from a different party, which is called a &quot;cohabitation&quot;. In the beginning of the Fifth Republic, presidential elections were held every seventh year and parliamentary elections every fifth year. Starting in the year 2000, the presidential and parliamentary elections were synchronized and are held every fifth year.

The Fifth Republic is France&#x27;s third-longest-lasting political regime, after the hereditary, feudal monarchy of the Ancien Régime and the parliamentary Third Republic (4 September 1870–10 July 1940).

== Origins ==

=== Instability of the Fourth Republic ===
The Fourth Republic had suffered from a lack of political consensus, a weak executive, and governments forming and falling in quick succession since 1946. With no party or coalition able to sustain a parliamentary majority, prime ministers found themselves unable to risk their political position with unpopular reforms.

=== May 1958 crisis ===
The trigger for the collapse of the French Fourth Republic was the Algiers crisis of 1958. France was still a colonial power, although conflict and revolt had begun the process of decolonization. French West Africa, French Indochina, and French Algeria still sent representatives to the French parliament under systems of limited suffrage in the French Union. Algeria in particular, despite being the colony with the largest French population, saw rising pressure for separation from Metropolitan France. The situation was complicated by those in Algeria, such as European settlers, native Jews, and Harkis (native Muslims who were loyal to France), who wanted to maintain the union with France. The Algerian War was not just a separatist movement but had elements of a civil war. 

Further complications came when a section of the French Army rebelled and openly backed the movement to defeat separation. Charles de Gaulle, who had retired from politics a decade before, placed himself in the midst of the crisis, calling on the nation to suspend the government and create a new constitutional system. The parliament was unable to choose a government amid popular protest, and De Gaulle was carried to power when the last parliament of the Fourth Republic voted for its own dissolution and the convening of a constitutional convention.

=== Transitional period ===

De Gaulle and his supporters proposed a system of strong presidents elected for seven-year terms. The president, under the proposed constitution, would have executive powers to run the country in consultation with a prime minister whom he would appoint. On 1 June 1958, Charles de Gaulle was appointed head of the government; on 3 June 1958, a constitutional law empowered the new government to draft a new constitution of France, and another law granted Charles de Gaulle and his cabinet the power to rule by decree for up to six months, except on certain matters related to the basic rights of citizens (criminal law, etc.). These plans were approved by more than 80% of those who voted in the referendum of 28 September 1958. The new constitution was signed into law on 4 October 1958. Since each new constitution established a new republic, France moved from the Fourth to the Fifth Republic.

=== 1958 constitution ===
The new constitution contained transitional clauses (articles 90–92) extending the period of rule by decree until the new institutions were operating. René Coty remained president of the Republic until the new president was proclaimed. On 21 December 1958, Charles de Gaulle was elected president of France by an electoral college. The provisional constitutional commission, acting in lieu of the constitutional council, proclaimed the results of the election on 9 January 1959. The new president began his office on that date, appointing Michel Debré as prime minister.

The 1958 constitution also replaced the French Union with the French Community, which allowed fourteen member territories (excluding Algeria) to assert their independence. 1960 became known as the &quot;Year of Africa&quot; because of this wave of newly independent states. Algeria became independent on 5 July 1962.

== Evolution ==

=== Election of the president ===

The president was initially elected by an electoral college but in 1962 de Gaulle proposed that the president be directly elected by the citizens and held a referendum on the change. Although the method and intent of de Gaulle in that referendum were contested by most political groups except for the Gaullists, the change was approved by the French electorate. The Constitutional Council declined to rule on the constitutionality of the referendum.

The president is now elected every five years, changed from seven by a constitutional referendum in 2000, to reduce the probability of cohabitation due to former differences in the length of terms for the National Assembly and presidency. The president is elected in one or two rounds of voting: if one candidate gets a majority of votes in the first round that person is president-elect; if no one gets a majority in the first round, the two candidates with the greatest number of votes go to a second round.

=== Separation of powers ===

Two major changes occurred in the 1970s regarding constitutional checks and balances. Traditionally, France operated according to parliamentary supremacy: no authority was empowered to rule on whether statutes passed by Parliament respected the constitutional rights of the citizens. In 1971, however, the Constitutional Council, arguing that the preamble of the constitution referenced the rights defined in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the preamble of the 1946 constitution, concluded that statutes must respect these rights and so declared partially unconstitutional a statute because it violated freedom of association. 

Only the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, or the president of either house of Parliament could ask for a constitutional review a statute was signed into law—which greatly reduces the likelihood of such a review if all these officeholders happened to be from the same side of politics, which was the case at the time. Then in 1974, a constitutional amendment widened this prerogative to 60 members of the National Assembly or 60 members of the senate. From that date, the opposition has been able to have controversial new statutes examined for constitutionality.

<text>The San Diego Conquistadors (known as the San Diego Sails in their final, partial season) were a professional basketball team based in San Diego, California, that competed in the American Basketball Association (ABA). The &quot;Q&#x27;s&quot;, as they were popularly known, played from 1972 to 1975. As the Sails, they played an incomplete season only, beginning the 1975–1976 season but folding after only 11 games with 3 wins and 8 losses.

== History ==

===San Diego Conquistadors===
The franchise was founded by Leonard Bloom in 1972 as the ABA&#x27;s first—and as it turned out, only—expansion team. The team was slated to play at the San Diego Sports Arena, but a feud between Bloom and Peter Graham, operator and lease-holder of the city-owned 14,400-seat arena, led Graham to lock the newborn team out of the facility for two years. Graham was reportedly upset about Bloom being awarded the ABA expansion team he had also sought. By the time the conflict was resolved in the fall of 1974, it was too late for a weakened franchise that had been forced to play, in the interim, at bandboxed Peterson Gymnasium (3,200 seats) on the campus of San Diego State University, and Golden Hall, a multipurpose facility in downtown.
After reaching the 1973 ABA Playoffs in their inaugural season, the Q&#x27;s seemingly pulled off a coup by paying center Wilt Chamberlain $600,000 to become their player-coach. But the Los Angeles Lakers sued to block their former star from playing for his new team. Relegated to a sideline role, Chamberlain was reduced to an indifferent, 7-foot-1-inch sideshow who once skipped a game in favor of an autograph session for his recently published autobiography. (His fill-in, on that and other occasions, was Stan Albeck, who later skippered the Chicago Bulls, San Antonio Spurs and New Jersey Nets of the NBA.) Nonetheless, the team again reached the postseason, bowing out in the first round, for the second year in a row, in the 1974 ABA Playoffs.

The season, however, was overshadowed by the arena situation. Frustrated with his inability to get a lease for the Sports Arena, Bloom announced plans for a 20,000-seat arena in Chula Vista. However, a referendum on the arena, held just after the season started, failed by only 294 votes. League officials then ordered Bloom to take preliminary steps toward moving to Los Angeles, in hopes of returning to a market abandoned by the Utah Stars four years earlier.

For their third season in 1974–75, the Conquistadors lost Chamberlain and finally gained a lease in the Sports Arena. But without Chamberlain as a gate attraction, the team was roundly ignored by San Diegans, and placed last in the Western Division, missing the 1975 ABA Playoffs.

=== San Diego Sails ===
Bloom sold the franchise during the summer of 1975 to Frank Goldberg, a former co-owner of the successful Denver Nuggets franchise. Goldberg started anew, renaming the team the San Diego Sails and hiring former University of Minnesota coach Bill Musselman. With a completely different roster, color scheme, set of uniforms and just about everything else, the re-branded Sails sought to repeat Denver&#x27;s turnaround a season earlier from mediocrity to championship contender.

But the Sails attracted just 3,060 fans to their home opener on October 24, 1975 – a loss to the Nuggets – and fan attendance rapidly dwindled further as the team limped to a 3–8 start; only 1,670 showed up for San Diego&#x27;s third (and ultimately last) home game, against the San Antonio Spurs. Goldberg soon learned San Diego was to be shut out of the pending ABA–NBA merger, reportedly due to the insistence of Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke, who refused to share his Southern California fan base with a team to the south.

With the team lacking fan support or a long-term future, Goldberg folded the franchise on November 12. The ABA, which planned to start the season with ten teams before having the Baltimore Claws fold operations after three exhibition games, saw its number drop to eight with the Sails&#x27; failure; on December 2, the Utah Stars also disbanded following failed merger talks with the Spirits of St. Louis, cutting the league to seven teams and forcing the ABA to shrink its original two-division setup to just one division where the five best teams would eventually meet up in the 1976 ABA Playoffs by the conclusion of the regular season.

=== The ABA&#x27;s demise and later San Diego basketball ===
The moribund state of the last-place Virginia Squires, who folded after the regular season ended but before the 1976 ABA Playoffs concluded, left the ABA with only six teams and forced the league to seek a merger with the more established NBA, which absorbed four of the six remaining teams. (The Indiana Pacers, New York Nets, Denver Nuggets and San Antonio Spurs joined the NBA, while the owners of the Kentucky Colonels and 6th place Spirits of St. Louis were paid off and folded their franchises.)

In 1978, the NBA&#x27;s Buffalo Braves arrived in San Diego as the San Diego Clippers; in 1984, they moved up the coast to become the Los Angeles Clippers. San Diego has not had another major-league pro basketball team since. A couple of minor-league hoops teams have called the city home: the CBA&#x27;s San Diego Wildcards, who folded after only 21 games in 1996, and the International Basketball League&#x27;s San Diego Stingrays, who played from 1999 to 2001. (San Diego has also had various franchises in the semi-pro, 21st century American Basketball Association, such as the B-Kings, Sol, Surf, Wildcats and Wildfire.)

<text>Subminiature photography is photographic technologies and techniques working with film material smaller in size than 35mm film, such as 16mm, 9.5mm, 17mm, or 17.5mm films. It is distinct from photomicrography, photographing microscopic subjects with a camera which is not particularly small.

==Definition==
Subminiature — &quot;very much reduced in size&quot;, Oxford English Dictionary.

A subminiature camera is a class of camera that is very much smaller than a &quot;miniature camera&quot;.
The term &quot;miniature camera&quot; was originally used to describe cameras using the 35 mm cine film as negative material for still photography; so cameras that used film smaller than 35mm were referred to as &quot;sub-miniature&quot;. The smallest of these are often referred to as &quot;ultra-miniature&quot;. Lipstick cameras and other small digital cameras are not included, because they don&#x27;t use film. The smaller subminiature cameras, called ultraminiature cameras, particularly Minox, are associated with spying. 

In short, some people define &quot;subminiature camera&quot; as one that uses film smaller than 35mm (even though some of these cameras are larger than full-framed 35mm cameras), but others define it any camera that has a film format smaller than the standard 35mm format of 24x36mm (even though some of these cameras are larger than full-framed 35mm cameras).

== Types ==
There are many subminiature camera types. Minox, followed by Tessina, GaMi, Rollei, Yashica, Mamiya, Gemflex, Stylophot and Minolta are the best-known manufacturers. All made small, precision cameras and a few were still in production in 2006 but by 2011, only the Minox TLX model was still in production. Production stopped by 2012. Getting film and processing for most smaller cameras is a challenge as they are no longer manufactured or supported. Most require cutting your own film and home-processing. But recently due to the rise of film again, a decent portion of film places now develop it along with many other types of film except Kodachrome in correlation to 110 film. 

The best known subminiature formats are—in increasing size—Minox (8×11 mm), Kodak disc (8×10 mm), 16 mm (10×14 mm), Super 16 mm (12×17 mm), 110 film (13×17 mm), 17.5mm for HIT camera( for example TONE camera), and the Advanced Photo System (APS) with different aspect ratios on 24 mm film. While many subminiature cameras were inexpensive and poorly manufactured (thus giving the format a bad name), Minox, Gami, Edixa, Rollei, Pentax and Minolta made quality cameras capable of producing fine results—even when enlarged. Some of these formats, or non-standard cartridges loaded with an otherwise standard ciné format, are best described as specialised (e.g., Minox or Sharan); half-frame 35 mm uses standard 35 mm film; cameras such as 110 and disc were aimed at the mass market.

The first subminiature single lens reflex is the Russian Narciss camera produced in 1961-65.

First making an appearance in the late 1930s, often as concealed cameras, sub-miniature cameras became popular soon after WWII when many consumer markets required small, inexpensive cameras such as the Petie in Germany. Friedrich Kaftansky&#x27;s Mini-flex was designed in 1931, on the market in 1933. Walter Zapp&#x27;s Riga Minox appeared in 1938. Kodak&#x27;s introduction of the 110 camera in the 1970s and the Kodak disc camera in the 1980s brought the sub-miniature camera to the forefront of the photographic market. It was very attractive to users wanting a smaller, flat, package. In 1988, Kodak announced that they were halting film camera production, having made over 25m cameras. It was thought that Chinese manufacturers made over that number alone. In 1998, Kodak announced that Kodak disc film production was stopping.
The 8x11mm Minox film format has retained special interest far beyond its original design life, because any film can be trimmed to work into its re-useable cassettes. No sprockets are needed in the film to make the camera film transport function. Minox also offered a developing tank that can be loaded with cassettes in daylight, which has continued in popularity, and copied by Minolta, and Yashica for its own models.

Various formats of sub-miniature camera have come and gone over the years as newer formats have replaced older ones. Many larger format cameras, especially 35 mm, became smaller in size and weight—partly due to the consumer demand for smaller cameras—and were able to replace some subminiature formats. For example, full-frame 35 mm cameras, such as the Minox 35 and the Olympus XA, were made as small as possible. Most other subminiature cameras are still usable if film can be obtained, particularly if the photographer is prepared to do the processing.

==Subminiature camera film==
* 16mm perforated or unperforated bulk roll film by Agfa, Kodak, Fujifilm in 100 ft to 1000 ft.
* Using film slitter to slit 35mm roll film or 120 film into Minox format film or 16mm film.
* 110 film is still manufactured by Lomography
* Disc and APS film is available but expired, the former from 1998 and latter from 2012

==Subminiature photography technique==

;Focusing

The process of focusing a subminiature camera is the same as any other camera:
* Unit focusing: the entire lens is moved back and forth relative to the film plane. Examples: Minox B, C, LX, TLX; Edixa 16, Tessina. Minox 110, Monolta 16
* Front element focusing: Rollei 16, Rollei 110.
* Fixed focus, feasible with the great depth of field of short focal length lenses: Minox EC, Minox ECX.
* Internal focusing is not used.

The small size of the camera and film require the use of a lens with short focal length, and hence great depth of field. This simplifies focusing to some extent.

The simplest system is to use a lens with fixed focus set at the hyperfocal distance. This will produce images that are acceptably sharp from infinity to some near plane (usually five to eight feet away). This system is used in most cheaper cameras.
More complex systems allow variable focus, through a dial or slider. Many cameras with this system have distance markings on the control; it is up to the user to set the focus according to the distance to the subject. Most Minox cameras use this system.

Some subminiature cameras include a rangefinder, for example the Minox 110. These increase the size.
Autofocus or through-the-lens focusing systems are not used on subminiature cameras to reduce the size requirements.

;Macro photography

Subminiature cameras are less suited to macro photography than larger cameras, although the relatively large depth of field at close distances is an advantage. Where concealment is required, subminiature cameras are required; they (particularly the various Minox models) are well known as spy cameras, where they were used to photograph documents close up. Minox cameras for these purposes come with a 24-inch measuring chain attached, with markings corresponding to certain distances, to assist in focusing at these short ranges.

;Telephoto

Few subminiature cameras have interchangeable lenses, which reduce the advantages of a small size system. Telephoto lenses for such small formats essentially do not exist, except for Steky and Gami. There have been attachments to allow cameras (generally Minox) to attach to telescopes or binoculars, but these give results of lower quality than the camera&#x27;s optics can achieve.

;Developing and enlarging

*Nikor or Jobo 16mm development reel
*Nikor 9.2mm or Jobo 8x11 development reel
*Minox daylight development tank
*10x14mm, 12x17mm, 14x21mm and 8x11mm negative carrier used with 35mm enlarger.
*Minox enlarger with 15mm Micro-Minox enlarging lens

<text>Bobby Lee Bonds Sr. (March 15, 1946 – August 23, 2003) was an American right fielder in Major League Baseball from to . He played for the San Francisco Giants, New York Yankees, California Angels, Chicago White Sox, Texas Rangers, Cleveland Indians, St. Louis Cardinals, and Chicago Cubs.

Noted for his combination of power hitting and speed, he was the first player to have more than two seasons of 30 home runs and 30 stolen bases, doing so a record five times (the record was matched only by his son Barry) and was the first to accomplish the feat in both major leagues. He became the second player to hit 300 career home runs and steal 300 bases, joining Willie Mays. Together with Barry, he is part of baseball&#x27;s most renowned father-son combination, holding the record for combined home runs, RBIs and stolen bases. A prolific leadoff hitter, he also set major league records for most times leading off a game with a home run in a career (35) and a season (11, in ), both records that have since been broken.

==Early life==
Born in Riverside, California, Bonds played varsity high school baseball at Riverside Polytechnic High School.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Bonds signed with the Giants in . Playing in the Giants&#x27; minor league system, he was Most Valuable Player of the class-A Western Carolinas League.

===San Francisco Giants (1968–1974)===
Bonds was on the San Francisco Giants from 1968-1974. During his career with the Giants, he hit a grand slam in his third at bat in his first major league game, June 25, 1968, becoming just the second player, and the first in MLB&#x27;s modern era, to hit a grand slam in his debut game. The first was Bill Duggleby in 1898. Bonds was named to the 1968 Topps All-Star Rookie Team.

Bonds was remarkable during this era for his combination of power and speed but also for his propensity to strike out.
In his first full season in , he set a major league record with 187 strikeouts, while also leading the NL in runs. He broke his own strikeout record a year later with 189. That record lasted until , when Adam Dunn broke it by striking out 195 times. This mark now belongs to Mark Reynolds with 223 in 2009. Bonds&#x27; 1970 total currently ranks tenth on the all-time single-season strikeout list. When Bonds retired, he ranked third in career strikeouts with 1,757, behind Willie Stargell&#x27;s 1,912 and Reggie Jackson&#x27;s 1,810. Bobby Bonds hit 39 home runs and had 43 stolen bases in 1973—the highest level of home runs and stolen bases (39+ of each) until José Canseco of the Oakland Athletics in 1988. Barry and Bobby had 1,094 combined home runs through 2007—a record for a father-son combination. He was a three-time Gold Glove Award winner (1971, 1973–74), and a three-time All-Star (1971, 1973 and 1975, winning the All-Star MVP award in 1973).

In 1970, he stole a career-high 48 bases, the highest total by a Giant since Frankie Frisch in 1921. Bonds was second in the NL in runs (134), third in triples (10) and stolen bases (48) and fourth in doubles (36) and total bases (334). He also set a major league record with 189 strikeouts, which stood for 34 years until it was broken in 2004 by Adam Dunn.

In 1971, he finished fourth in the NL in runs batted in and second in runs, leading the Giants with a .288 average as they won the National League West title, earning their first postseason berth since the 1962 World Series. A bruised rib cage limited his play in the 1971 NLCS, his only postseason appearance. He was a late-inning replacement for rookie Dave Kingman in Game 1 and did not play in Game 2 before starting the final two games, batting 2-for-8 in the series. That season, he placed fourth in the NL MVP award voting. In 1972, Bonds scored 118 runs, which was second in the NL (the third straight season he was second in runs scored) and his 26 home runs was ninth in the circuit while his 44 stolen bases was 4th in the league. In 1973, he placed third in the MVP voting after hitting a career-high 39 home runs, 11 of them to start a game and leading the league in runs a second time. Bonds was named the NL Player of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; in 1973 and was also named an outfielder on &quot;TSN&quot;&#x27;s American League All-Star Team in 1977.

===New York Yankees (1975)===

After the 1974 season, the Giants traded Bonds to the New York Yankees for Bobby Murcer.

In 1975, Bonds broke Eddie Yost&#x27;s career record of 28 leadoff home runs. His eventual record of 35 stood until Rickey Henderson broke it in 1989, and his NL record of 30 was broken by Craig Biggio in 2003. His single-season mark of 11 was broken by Brady Anderson in 1996. His 32 home runs was fourth in the AL and his 30 stolen bases were eighth in the league. He was voted honorable mention on AP&#x27;s All-MLB team.

===California Angels (1976–1977)===
With the Angels needing right-handed power hitters, he was acquired from the Yankees for Mickey Rivers and Ed Figueroa on December 11, 1975. In 1977, he tied the Angels club record for home runs in a season (37).

===Chicago White Sox (1978)===
Bonds was acquired along with Richard Dotson and Thad Bosley by the Chicago White Sox from the Angels for Brian Downing, Chris Knapp and Dave Frost on December 5, 1977. The transaction was part of Bill Veeck and Roland Hemond&#x27;s rent-a-player strategy in which they attempted to get one productive campaign from a star player who was expected to become a free agent at season&#x27;s end. It had worked the previous year when Richie Zisk and Oscar Gamble helped to keep the White Sox in contention into September but it failed when the team opened 1978 with Bonds as its right fielder and a 9–20 start.

===Texas Rangers (1978)===
He was sent to the Texas Rangers for Claudell Washington and Rusty Torres on May 16, 1978.

===Cleveland Indians (1979)===
Bonds, along with Len Barker, was dealt from the Rangers to the Cleveland Indians for Jim Kern and Larvell Blanks on October 3, 1978.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1980)===

His trade to the St. Louis Cardinals for John Denny and Jerry Mumphrey on December 7, 1979, was the sixth in just over five years.

===Chicago Cubs (1981)===
After his contract was purchased by the Chicago Cubs from the Rangers on June 4, 1981, he had played with eight different MLB teams in eight years. This prompted a line in the lyrics to Terry Cashman&#x27;s 1981 hit song &quot;Talkin&#x27; Baseball&quot;, in which the line in part reads &quot;And Bobby Bonds can play for everyone.&quot; In the first inning of his first game with the Cubs, Bonds tripped on a seam in the artificial turf at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh and broke a bone in his wrist. He went on the 21-day disabled list and didn&#x27;t play again until after the 1981 Major League Baseball strike. 

===St. Lucie Legends (1989)===
Bonds joined the St. Lucie Legends of the newly formed Senior Professional Baseball Association in 1989, playing for one season as well as managing for the second half of the season. The club folded after their inaugural season and the league folded during the second season.

===Legacy===
Bonds&#x27; 461 career stolen bases ranked 12th in major league history upon his retirement. He was hitting instructor for the Indians from 1984 to 1987, and rejoined the Giants as a coach in 1993 when his son Barry signed with the team as a free agent. As a player, coach, scout and front-office employee, he was with the Giants franchise for 23 seasons. Barry Bonds is the only other player in major league history to hit 300 home runs and steal 400 bases, and also the only other player to have five 30–30 seasons.

Eleven times Bonds was in his league&#x27;s top 10 in stolen bases, with eight of those seasons in the top six. Seven times he was among the league top ten home run hitters and nine times he was among the top ten in runs scored, leading the NL in 1971 and 1973. He was in the top ten in total bases eight times, leading the NL in 1973. He had as of 2018 the fifth-highest career power–speed number, behind his son Barry, Rickey Henderson, Willie Mays, and Alex Rodriguez, at 386.0.

==Personal life==
His brother, Robert, won two gold medals in the hurdles at the high school track and field state finals in 1960, and was an NFL Draft pick in 1965. In 1964, Bobby was a High School All-American in track &amp; field, while also being named Southern California High School Athlete of the Year. His sister, Rosie, was a 1964 Olympic hurdler.

On May 3, 1963, he married Patricia Howard. They had three sons: Barry went on to become one of the greatest major league players of all time, and Rick and Bobby Jr., who played eleven years of pro ball but never made it to the major leagues.

Bonds died of complications from lung cancer and a brain tumor at age 57 in San Carlos, California. He is interred at Skylawn Memorial Park in San Mateo, California.

<doc id="244737" wikidata="Q223562" url="?curid=244737" title="30–30 club">
<text>In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 30–30 club is the group of 47 batters who have collected 30 home runs and 30 stolen bases in a single season. &quot;Baseball Digest&quot; called the 30–30 club &quot;the most celebrated feat that can be achieved by a player who has both power and speed.&quot; Six members have been elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

Ken Williams was the first to achieve this, in 1922. He remained the sole member of the club for 34 years until Willie Mays achieved consecutive 30–30 seasons in 1956 and 1957. Bobby Bonds became the club&#x27;s fourth member in 1969; he subsequently became the first player to achieve the mark in three, four, and five seasons. His son Barry Bonds is the only other player with five 30–30 seasons.

In all, 47 players have reached the 30–30 club; 16 have done so more than once. Of these 47, 31 were right-handed batters, 10 were left-handed, and six were switch hitters. Bobby Witt Jr. of the Kansas City Royals is the only shortstop to achieve multiple 30–30 seasons, reaching this milestone in both 2023, with 30 home runs and 49 stolen bases, and 2024, with 32 home runs and 31 stolen bases. New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor almost achieved consecutive 30–30 seasons, first reaching the milestone in 2023 with 31 home runs and 31 stolen bases, and then falling 1 stolen base short in 2024, with 33 home runs and 29 stolen bases.

Ten of the 47 players (including five active members of the 30–30 club) have played for only one major league team. The New York Mets are the only franchise to have four players reach the milestone. The Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Indians, Colorado Rockies, Los Angeles Dodgers, and San Francisco Giants each have had three players reach the milestone. Five players – Hank Aaron, Barry Bonds, Willie Mays, Alex Rodriguez and Sammy Sosa – are also members of the 500-home-run club, and Aaron, Mays and Rodriguez are also members of the 3,000-hit club. Dale Murphy, Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds, Larry Walker, Jimmy Rollins, Ryan Braun, Mookie Betts, Ronald Acuña Jr., and Shohei Ohtani won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in the same year as their 30–30 season; Bonds did so twice, in 1990 and 1992. Mays and Rollins also reached the 20–20–20 club in the same season. A single season has seen as many as five players accomplish 30–30; this happened in 1987, 1996, 1997, 2011, and 2023. The feat has been twice been accomplished by teammates: Darryl Strawberry and for the Mets in 1987, and Ellis Burks and Dante Bichette for the Rockies in 1996.

<doc id="244739" wikidata="Q1172239" url="?curid=244739" title="Gabinia gens">
<text>The gens Gabinia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens first appear in the second century BC. The &quot;nomen&quot; derives from the city of Gabii, east of Rome.

==Praenomina==
All of the Gabinii known from historical records bore the praenomina &quot;Aulus&quot;, &quot;Publius&quot;, and possibly &quot;Gaius&quot;.

==Branches and cognomina==
The Gabinii do not seem to have been divided into distinct &quot;stirpes&quot;. The surnames &quot;Capito, Cimber&quot;, and &quot;Sisenna&quot; are associated with individual members.

==Members==
* (Aulus?) Gabinius, placed in command of the garrison at Scodra in Illyricum by the proconsul Lucius Anicius Gallus in 167 BC.
* Aulus Gabinius, tribune of the plebs in 139 BC, he introduced the first &quot;lex tabellaria&quot;, permitting voting by ballot.
* Aulus Gabinius, quaestor in 101 BC, serving under the proconsul Marcus Antonius against the Cilician pirates.
* Aulus (or Gaius?) Gabinius, a legate in the Social War, who campaigned successfully against the Marsi and Lucani; he was killed while blockading an enemy camp, BC 89.
* Aulus Gabinius, a military tribune who fought under Sulla at the Battle of Chaeronea. In BC 81, Sulla sent him to Asia with instructions for Lucius Licinius Murena to end the war with Mithridates of Pontus. He was known for his moderation and sense of honour.
* Aulus Gabinius, consul in 58 BC. As tribune of the plebs in 66, he had introduced the law giving Pompeius command in the war against the pirates. As proconsul of Syria, he intervened in an Egyptian dynastic struggle, for which he was later prosecuted, fined, and exiled, although he was later recalled by Caesar.
* Aulus Gabinius A. f. Sisenna, son of the consul, he begged Memmius to stop haranguing his father before the people, but to no avail.
* Publius Gabinius Capito, praetor in 89 BC, he was subsequently propraetor in Achaea. On his return to Rome he was accused of extortion by Lucius Calpurnius Piso, and condemned. In 76 BC he was one of three envoys sent to Erythrae in order to collect Sibylline prophecies.
* Publius Gabinius Capito, or Gaius Gabinius Cimber, an active member of the conspiracy of Catiline in 63 BC.
* Aulus Gabinius Secundus, consul in AD 35.
* Aulus Gabinius Secundus, consul in AD 43.
* Publius Gabinius Secundus Chaucius (or Cauchius), a general under Claudius.
* Gaius Gabinius Barbarus Pompeianus, proconsul of Asia between 212 and 217.
* (Gabinius) Barbarus Pompeianus, &quot;consularis&quot; of Campania in 333 AD.
* Gabinius, a king of the Germanic Quadi, murdered by Valentinian I &quot;circa&quot; AD 374.
* Gabinius Barbarus Pompeianus, governor of Africa &quot;circa&quot; AD 400, and &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; of Rome during Alaric&#x27;s siege in 409. He proposed making sacrifices to the pagan gods to protect the city, and was lynched by a mob during a food shortage.

<doc id="244742" wikidata="Q2562594" url="?curid=244742" title="Dutch famine of 1944–1945">
<text>The Dutch famine of 1944–1945, also known as the Hunger Winter (from Dutch &quot;Hongerwinter&quot;), was a famine that took place in the German-occupied Netherlands, especially in the densely populated western provinces north of the great rivers, during the relatively harsh winter of 1944–1945, near the end of World War II.

A German blockade cut off food and fuel shipments from farm towns. Some 4.5 million were affected and survived thanks to soup kitchens. Loe de Jong (1914–2005), author of &quot;The Kingdom of the Netherlands During World War II&quot;, estimated at least 22,000 deaths occurred due to the famine. Another author estimated 18,000 deaths from the famine. Most of the victims were reportedly elderly men.

The famine was alleviated first by &quot;Swedish bread&quot; flour shipped in from Sweden to Dutch harbours, and subsequently by the airlift of food by the Royal Air Force, the Royal Canadian Air Force, and the United States Army Air Forces – after an agreement with the occupying Germans that if the Germans did not shoot at the mercy flights, the Allies would not bomb the German positions. These were Operations Manna and Chowhound. Operation Faust also trucked in food to the province.

Although the humanitarian missions mitigated the emergency, the famine persisted and ended only with the liberation of the Netherlands by the Allies in May 1945.

== Causes ==


After D-Day in the summer of 1944, the Allied forces, to their own surprise, swiftly advanced from Normandy and overran northern France and Belgium. In anticipation of a likewise imminent collapse of German defences in the Netherlands, the Dutch national railways complied with the exiled Dutch government&#x27;s appeal for a nationwide railway strike starting in September 1944. This precisely coincided with the beginning of Operation Market Garden, the Allied forces&#x27; sharp thrust offensive deep into eastern Dutch territory that same month. The Allies were able to swiftly liberate southern portions of Dutch territory, but ceased their advance further into the Netherlands when Operation Market Garden failed in its attempt to seize a bridge across the Rhine at Arnhem after a German counter-offensive.

Meanwhile, after a public warning by the German administration&#x27;s &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; Arthur Seyss-Inquart on September 24 that sabotage of the railways, telephone lines, or post offices would be severely and collectively punished, the Nazi military command led by &quot;Wehrmachtbefehlshaber&quot; Friedrich Christiansen began to implement the German retaliation by placing an embargo on all food transports to the western Netherlands. The food embargo started immediately as the military counter-offensive against Allied troops (Market Garden) was winding down on September 27. The embargo was partially lifted after three weeks, and fully lifted after six weeks in early November 1944, because the Germans feared chaos and disease might spread.

This lifting of the blockade, however, didn&#x27;t lead to food supply resuming and reaching pre-embargo levels. The drastic food scarcity that was ignited continued to persist as a result of the increasingly harsh winter, increasing scarcity of other resources such as fuel and vehicles, the ongoing administrative and logistic inconveniences caused by the Germans, such as transport restrictions, shipment delays, and defensive flooding; as well as due to farmers and traders who had switched to supplying the black market during the embargo remaining in that parallel circuit. In the last two months of 1944 the officially distributed ration stock supply began to dwindle: first slowly, then drastically. The rations, which had been relatively stable up to around D-Day (June 1944), became progressively less and less worth in food value in the subsequent months, particularly in October and beyond.

The overall Allied advance into Germany was delayed by supply problems as the strategic port of Antwerp was not usable until the approaches had been secured and cleared in the Battle of the Scheldt. But Montgomery had given priority to &quot;Market Garden&quot; and to the capture of the French Channel ports like Boulogne, Calais, and Dunkirk, which were resolutely defended and had suffered demolitions by the retreating Germans. These developments led to Germans becoming more securely entrenched north of the major rivers in all of the Netherlands, which originally had been anticipated to fall into the hands of the Allies before the end of 1944.

== Starvation ==

In the last months of 1944, in anticipation of the coming famine, tens of thousands of children were brought from the cities to rural areas where many remained until the end of the war.

In October, food shortages began to escalate everywhere in the still-occupied parts of the country. But particularly in the cities in the western Netherlands the stocks of various food items rapidly ran out in their entirety. The adult rations in cities such as Amsterdam dropped to below 1000 calories (4,200 kilojoules) a day by the end of November 1944 and to 580 calories in the west by the end of February 1945. Over this &quot;Hongerwinter&quot; (&quot;Hunger winter&quot;), a number of factors combined to cause starvation in especially the large cities in the West of the Netherlands. The winter in the month of January 1945 itself was unusually harsh, freezing rivers and canals and thereby prohibiting the important system of supply transport by boat for roughly a month between early January 1945 and early February 1945.

Also, the German army destroyed docks and bridges to flood the country and impede the Allied advance. This led to significant amount of land, particularly in the north and west, up to 250.000 hectare in total, to become flooded, further distorting supply routes and isolating regions from each other.

Thirdly, Allied bombing made it extremely difficult to transport food in bulk, since Allied bombers could not distinguish German military and civilian shipments. As the south-eastern (the Maas valley) and the south-western part of the Netherlands (Walcheren and Beveland) became one of the main western battlefields, these conditions combined to make the transport of existing food stocks in large enough quantities nearly impossible.

Malnutrition affected all occupied areas, but starvation level was reached in the western section of the country, then home to 4.5 million people. Butter disappeared after October 1944, shortly after railway transport to the western Netherlands stopped due to the railway strike. The supply of vegetable fats dwindled to a minuscule seven-month supply of 1.3 liters per person. At first 100 grams of cheese were allotted every two weeks; meat coupons became worthless. The bread ration had already dropped from 2,200 to 1,800 and then to 1,400 grams per week. Then it fell to 1,000 grams in October, and by April 1945 to 400 grams a week. Together with one kilogram of potatoes, this then formed the entire weekly ration. The black market increasingly ran out of food as well, and with the gas and electricity and heat turned off, everyone was very cold and very hungry. Tulip bulbs and sugar beets were commonly consumed. Furniture and houses were dismantled and trees were felled to provide fuel for heating.

In search of food, Netherlanders would walk for tens of kilometres to trade valuables for food at farms.

Deaths in the three big cities of the Western Netherlands (The Hague, Rotterdam, and Amsterdam) started in earnest in December 1944, reaching a peak in March 1945, but remained very high in April and May 1945. Malnutrition was rampant throughout all of the country. The famine was fully underway by January but the deadliest month would become March 1945.

== Humanitarian intervention ==
By the middle of that month Swedish Red Cross flour, known as the &quot;Swedish bread&quot;, (which had originally arrived in January from Sweden, but the shipment had been stuck unloaded in the northern harbour of Delfzijl) began to reach a network of Dutch bakeries in cities, towns and villages, who used it to bake bread and ration it to the local population. For many, that was the first proper bread (without diluted ingredients) they consumed in months. The following month, more humanitarian interventions took place, this time by airdrops. From 29 April to 7 May Operation Manna was conducted by the Royal Air Force and Royal Canadian Air Force. From 1 to 8 May, the U.S. Army Air Forces conducted Operation Chowhound. The Germans agreed not to shoot at the planes flying the mercy missions, and the Allies agreed not to bomb German positions. A third humanitarian assistance was domestically organized via a land-based, civilian supply chain from the east of the country. Called &quot;Operation Faust&quot;, food was trucked beginning on 2 May, first to the centrally located Rhenen before further distribution westwards.

== End of the famine ==

The Dutch famine ended with the liberation by the Allies. Wehrmacht forces in the Netherlands surrendered on May 5, two days before Germany&#x27;s overall surrender and official end of the war in Europe. Ongoing and new humanitarian assistances took place in the liberated country and the death rate quickly returned to normal figures by the early summer of 1945.

== Legacy ==


The Dutch famine of 1944–45 was a rare case of a famine which took place in a modern, developed, and literate country, albeit one suffering under the privations of occupation and war. The well-documented experience has helped scientists to measure the effects of famine on human health.

The Dutch Famine Birth Cohort Study found that the children of pregnant women exposed to famine were more susceptible to diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, microalbuminuria and other health problems.

Grandchildren of pregnant women carrying female babies during the famine were also shown to be smaller at birth and suffer increased health issues later in life. This suggests damage or epigenetic changes to the ova developing inside the female fetus &quot;in utero,&quot; a phenomenon known as &quot;intergenerational inheritance&quot;.

The discovery of the cause of coeliac disease may also be partly attributed to the Dutch famine. With wheat in very short supply there was an improvement at a children&#x27;s ward of coeliac patients. Stories tell of the first precious supplies of bread being given specifically to the (no longer) sick children, prompting an immediate relapse. Thus in the 1940s the Dutch paediatrician Dr. Willem Dicke was able to corroborate his previously researched hypothesis that wheat intake was aggravating coeliac disease. Later Dicke went on to prove his theory.

Audrey Hepburn spent her childhood in the Netherlands (officially residing in Arnhem, then in Velp) during the famine and despite her later wealth she had lifelong negative medical repercussions. She had anemia, respiratory illnesses, and œdema as a result.

Subsequent academic research on the children who were affected in the second trimester of their mother&#x27;s pregnancy found an increased incidence of schizophrenia in these children. Also increased among them were the rates of schizotypal personality and neurological defects.

<doc id="244747" wikidata="Q47140" url="?curid=244747" title="Brahmin">
<text>Brahmin (; ) is a varna (caste) within Hindu society. The other three varnas are the Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. The traditional occupation of Brahmins is that of priesthood (purohit, pandit, or pujari) at Hindu temples or at socio-religious ceremonies, and the performing of rite of passage rituals, such as solemnising a wedding with hymns and prayers.

Traditionally, Brahmins are accorded the highest ritual status of the four social classes, and they also served as spiritual teachers (guru or acharya). In practice, Indian texts suggest that some Brahmins historically also became agriculturalists, warriors, traders, and had also held other occupations in the Indian subcontinent.
==Origin and history ==
It seems likely that Kannauj and Middle country was the place of origin of majority of migrating Brahmins throughout the medieval centuries. Coming from Kannauj is a frequent claim among Brahmins in areas distant from Madhyadesha or Ganges heartland.

===Generic meaning of the term &quot;Brahmin&quot;===
The term Brahmin appears extensively in ancient and medieval Sutras and commentary texts of Buddhism and Jainism. Modern scholars state that such usage of the term Brahmin in ancient texts does not imply a caste, but simply &quot;masters&quot; (experts), guardian, recluse, preacher or guide of any tradition. An alternate synonym for Brahmin in the Buddhist and other non-Hindu tradition is &quot;Mahano&quot;.

Strabo cites Megasthenes, highlighting two Indian philosophical schools Sramana and Brahmana:
Patrick Olivelle states that both Buddhist and Brahmanical literature repeatedly define &quot;Brahmin&quot; not in terms of family of birth, but in terms of personal qualities. These virtues and characteristics mirror the values cherished in Hinduism during the Sannyasa stage of life, or the life of renunciation for spiritual pursuits. Brahmins, states Olivelle, were the social class from which most ascetics came. The term Brahmin in Indian texts has also signified someone who is good and virtuous, not just someone of priestly class.

=== Purusha sukta ===
The earliest inferred reference to &quot;Brahmin&quot; as a possible social class is in the Rigveda, occurs once, and the hymn is called Purusha Sukta. According to a hymn in &quot;Mandala&quot; 10, Rigveda 10.90.11-2, Brahmins are described as having emerged from the mouth of Purusha, being that part of the body from which words emerge.

The Purusha Sukta varna verse is now generally considered to have been inserted at a later date into the Vedic text, possibly as a charter myth. Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton, a professor of Sanskrit and Religious studies, state, &quot;there is no evidence in the Rigveda for an elaborate, much-subdivided and overarching caste system&quot;, and &quot;the varna system seems to be embryonic in the Rigveda and, both then and later, a social ideal rather than a social reality&quot;.

According to Vijay Nath, in the Markandeya Purana (250 CE), there are references to Brahmins who were born into the families of Raksasas. He posits that this is an indication that some Brahmins are immigrants and some are also mixed.

=== Gupta era ===

According to Abraham Eraly, &quot;Brahmin as a varna hardly had any presence in historical records before the Gupta Empire era&quot; (3rd century to 6th century CE), when Buddhism dominated the land. &quot;No Brahmin, no sacrifice, no ritualistic act of any kind ever, even once, is referred to&quot; in any Indian texts between third century BCE and the late first century CE. He also states that &quot;The absence of literary and material evidence, however, does not mean that Brahmanical culture did not exist at that time, but only that it had no elite patronage and was largely confined to rural folk, and therefore went unrecorded in history&quot;. Their role as priests and repository of sacred knowledge, as well as their importance in the practice of Vedic Shrauta rituals, grew during the Gupta Empire era and thereafter.

However, the knowledge about actual history of Brahmins or other varnas of Hinduism in and after the first millennium is fragmentary and preliminary, with little that is from verifiable records or archaeological evidence, and much that is constructed from ahistorical Sanskrit works and fiction. Michael Witzel writes:
==Gauda and Dravida Brahmins==
According to Kalhana&#x27;s &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; (12th cent. CE) and Sahyadrikhanda (5th–13th cent. CE) of Skandapurana, Brahmins are broadly classified into two groups based on geography. The northern Pancha Gauda group comprises five Brahmin communities, as mentioned in the text, residing north of the Vindhya mountain range. Historically, the Vindhya mountain range formed the southern boundary of the &quot;Āryāvarta&quot;, the territory of the ancient Indo-Aryan peoples, and Gauda has territorial, ethnographic and linguistic connotations. Linguistically, the term &quot;Gauda&quot; refers to the Sanskrit-derived languages of northern India. The Pancha Gauda Brahmins are:
* Sarasvata
* Kanyakubja
* Gauda
* Utkala
* Maithila
Subcastes of Gaur Brahmins are:

* Sanadhya
* Paliwal

Subcastes of Kanyakubja Brahmins are:
*Jujhatiya Brahmin
*Saryupareen Brahmin
*Bengali Kulin Brahmin
*Anavil Brahmins ( Though they are generally not accepted as Brahmins)
*Khas Brahmins – Nepali Bahuns

The Pancha Dravida Brahmins reside to the south of the Vindhya mountain range. The term &quot;Dravida&quot; too has territorial, linguistic and ethnological connotations, referring to southern India, the Dravidian people, and to the Dravidian languages of southern India. The Pancha Dravida Brahmins are:
* Karnataka (Karnataka Brahmins)
* Tailanga (Telugu Brahmins)
* Dravida (Brahmins of Tamil Nadu and Kerala)
* Maharashtraka (Maharashtrian Brahmins)
* Gurjara (Gujarati)

==Role in the society ==

===Vedic duties===
The Dharmasutra and Dharmashastra texts of Hinduism describe the expectations, duties and role of Brahmins.

According to Kulkarni, the Grhya-sutras state that Yajna, Adhyayana (studying the vedas and teaching), dana pratigraha (accepting and giving gifts) are the &quot;peculiar duties and privileges of brahmins&quot;. John Bussanich states that the ethical precepts set for Brahmins, in ancient Indian texts, are similar to Greek virtue-ethics, that &quot;Manu&#x27;s dharmic Brahmin can be compared to Aristotle&#x27;s man of practical wisdom&quot;, and that &quot;the virtuous Brahmin is not unlike the Platonic-Aristotelian philosopher&quot; with the difference that the latter was not sacerdotal.

The Brahmins were expected to perform all six Vedic duties as opposed to other twice-borns who performed three. 
===Actual occupations===
Historical records, state scholars, suggest that Brahmin varna was not limited to a particular status or priest and the teaching profession. Chanakya, a Brahmin born in 375 BCE, was an ancient Indian polymath who was active as a teacher, author, strategist, philosopher, economist, jurist, and royal advisor, who assisted the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya in his rise to power and is widely credited for having played an important role in the establishment of the Maurya Empire. Historical records from mid 1st millennium CE and later, suggest Brahmins were agriculturalists and warriors in medieval India, quite often instead of as exception. Donkin and other scholars state that Hoysala Empire records frequently mention Brahmin merchants who &quot;carried on trade in horses, elephants and pearls&quot; and transported goods throughout medieval India before the 14th-century.

The Pāli Canon depicts Brahmins as the most prestigious and elite non-Buddhist figures. They mention them parading their learning. The Pali Canon and other Buddhist texts such as the &quot;Jataka Tales&quot; also record the livelihood of Brahmins to have included being farmers, handicraft workers and artisans such as carpentry and architecture. Buddhist sources extensively attest, state Greg Bailey and Ian Mabbett, that Brahmins were &quot;supporting themselves not by religious practice, but employment in all manner of secular occupations&quot;, in the classical period of India. Some of the Brahmin occupations mentioned in the Buddhist texts such as &quot;Jatakas&quot; and &quot;Sutta Nipata&quot; are very lowly. The &quot;Dharmasutras&quot; too mention Brahmin farmers.

According to Haidar and Sardar, unlike the Mughal Empire in Northern India, Brahmins figured prominently in the administration of Deccan sultanates. Under Golconda Sultanate Telugu Niyogi Brahmins served in many different roles such as accountants, ministers, in the revenue administration, and in the judicial service. The Deccan sultanates also heavily recruited Marathi Brahmins at different levels of their administration. During the days of Maratha Empire in the 17th and 18th century, the occupation of Marathi Brahmins ranged from being state administrators, being warriors to being de facto rulers as Peshwa.
After the collapse of Maratha empire, Brahmins in Maharashtra region were quick to take advantage of opportunities opened up by the new British rulers. They were the first community to take up Western education and therefore dominated lower level of British administration in the 19th century. Similarly, the Tamil Brahmins were also quick to take up English education during British colonial rule and dominate government service and law.

Eric Bellman states that during the Islamic Mughal Empire era Brahmins served as advisers to the Mughals, later to the British Raj. The East India Company also recruited sepoys (soldiers) from the Brahmin communities of Bihar and Awadh (in the present day Uttar Pradesh) for the Bengal army. Many Brahmins, in other parts of South Asia lived like other varna, engaged in all sorts of professions. Among Nepalese Hindus, for example, Niels Gutschow and Axel Michaels report the actual observed professions of Brahmins from 18th- to early 20th-century included being temple priests, ministers, merchants, farmers, potters, masons, carpenters, coppersmiths, stone workers, barbers, and gardeners, among others.

Other 20th-century surveys, such as in the state of Uttar Pradesh, recorded that the primary occupation of almost all Brahmin families surveyed was neither priestly nor Vedas-related, but like other varnas, ranged from crop farming (80 per cent of Brahmins), dairy, service, labour such as cooking, and other occupations. The survey reported that the Brahmin families involved in agriculture as their primary occupation in modern times plough the land themselves, many supplementing their income by selling their labour services to other farmers.

==Bhakti movement and Social Reform movements==
Many of the prominent thinkers and earliest champions of the Bhakti movement were Brahmins, a movement that encouraged a direct relationship of an individual with a personal god. Among the many Brahmins who nurtured the Bhakti movement were Ramanuja, Nimbarka, Vallabha and Madhvacharya of Vaishnavism, Ramananda, another devotional poet sant. Born in a Brahmin family, Ramananda welcomed everyone to spiritual pursuits without discriminating anyone by gender, class, caste or religion (such as Muslims). He composed his spiritual message in poems, using widely spoken vernacular language rather than Sanskrit, to make it widely accessible. The Hindu tradition recognises him as the founder of the Hindu Ramanandi Sampradaya, the largest monastic renunciant community in Asia in modern times.

Other medieval era Brahmins who led spiritual movements without social or gender discrimination included Andal (9th-century female poet), Basava (12th-century Lingayatism), Dnyaneshwar (13th-century Bhakti poet), Vallabha Acharya (16th-century Vaishnava poet), Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (14th-century Vaishnava saint) were among others.

Many 18th and 19th century Brahmins are credited with religious movements that criticised idolatry. For example, the Brahmins Raja Ram Mohan Roy led Brahmo Samaj and Dayananda Saraswati led the Arya Samaj.

==Outside the Indian subcontinent==

Some Brahmins formed an influential group in Burmese Buddhist kingdoms in 18th- and 19th-century. The court Brahmins were locally called &quot;Punna&quot;. During the Konbaung dynasty, Buddhist kings relied on their court Brahmins to consecrate them to kingship in elaborate ceremonies, and to help resolve political questions. This role of Hindu Brahmins in a Buddhist kingdom, states Leider, may have been because Hindu texts provide guidelines for such social rituals and political ceremonies, while Buddhist texts do not.

The Brahmins were also consulted in the transmission, development and maintenance of law and justice system outside India. Hindu Dharmasastras, particularly Manusmriti written by the Prajapati Manu, states Anthony Reid, were &quot;greatly honored in Burma (Myanmar), Siam (Thailand), Cambodia and Java-Bali (Indonesia) as the defining documents of law and order, which kings were obliged to uphold. They were copied, translated and incorporated into local law code, with strict adherence to the original text in Burma and Siam, and a stronger tendency to adapt to local needs in Java (Indonesia)&quot;.

The mythical origins of Cambodia are credited to a Brahmin prince named Kaundinya, who arrived by sea, married a Naga princess living in the flooded lands. Kaudinya founded Kambuja-desa, or Kambuja (transliterated to Kampuchea or Cambodia). Kaundinya introduced Hinduism, particularly Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and Harihara (half Vishnu, half Shiva), and these ideas grew in southeast Asia in the 1st millennium CE.

The &quot;Chams Balamon&quot; (Hindu Brahmin Chams) form a majority of the Cham population in Vietnam.

Brahmins have been part of the Royal tradition of Thailand, particularly for the consecration and to mark annual land fertility rituals of Buddhist kings. A small Brahmanical temple Devasathan, established in 1784 by King Rama I of Thailand, has been managed by ethnically Thai Brahmins ever since. The temple hosts &quot;Phra Phikhanesuan&quot; (Ganesha), &quot;Phra Narai&quot; (Narayana, Vishnu), &quot;Phra Itsuan&quot; (Shiva), Uma, Brahma, Indra (&quot;Sakka&quot;) and other Hindu deities. The tradition asserts that the Thai Brahmins have roots in Hindu holy city of Varanasi and southern state of Tamil Nadu, go by the title &quot;Pandita&quot;, and the various annual rites and state ceremonies they conduct has been a blend of Buddhist and Hindu rituals. The coronation ceremony of the Thai king is almost entirely conducted by the royal Brahmins.

==Demographics==
According to 2007 reports, Brahmins in India are about 5% of its total population, and back then were numbering 56 million.

The Himalayan states of Uttarakhand (20%) and Himachal Pradesh (14%) have the highest percentage of Brahmin population relative to respective state&#x27;s total Hindus, followed by Delhi (12%), Jammu Kashmir (11%), Uttar Pradesh (10%), in other states the Brahmins being less than 10% of the population, the lowest being in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, where they form 1%.

According to the Center for the Study of Developing Societies, in 2004 about 65% of Brahmin households in India earned less than $100 a month compared to 89% of Scheduled Tribes, 91% of Scheduled Castes and 86% of Muslims.

<text>Chelyabinsk is the administrative center and largest city of Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia. It is the seventh-largest city in Russia, with a population of over 1.1 million people, and the second-largest city in the Ural Federal District, after Yekaterinburg. Chelyabinsk is located to the east behind the south part of the Ural Mountains and runs along the Miass River. 

The area of Chelyabinsk contained the ancient settlement of Arkaim, which belonged to the Sintashta culture. In 1736, a fortress by the name of Chelyaba was founded on the site of a Bashkir village. Chelyabinsk was granted town status by 1787. Chelyabinsk began to grow rapidly by the early 20th century as a result of the construction of railway links from the Russian core to Siberia, including the Trans-Siberian Railway. Its population reached 70,000 by 1917. Under the Soviet Union, Chelyabinsk became a major industrial centre during the 1930s. The Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant was built in 1933. During World War II, the city was a major contributor to the manufacture of tanks and ammunition.

In the 1990s and 2000s, a number of industries in Chelyabinsk ceased to exist due to the difficult economic situation, As of the 2020s, it continues to experience difficulties in the areas of ecology, economic and economic spheres, and urban improvement. Nevertheless, it is one of the largest industrial centers of the Urals, where industry accounts for almost 40% of the gross municipal product, especially heavy industries such as metallurgy and military production. It is home to several educational institutions, mainly South Ural State University and Chelyabinsk State University.

==History==
===Ancient Sintashta civilization===
Archaeologists have discovered ruins of the ancient town of Arkaim in the vicinity of the city of Chelyabinsk. Ruins and artifacts in Arkaim and other sites in the region indicate a relatively advanced civilization existing in the area since the 2nd millennium BC, which was of proto-Indo-Iranian origin.

The Arkaim site, located in the Sintashta-Petrovka cultural area, was known by Russian archaeologists for at least 70 years, however, it was mostly ignored by non-Russian anthropological circles. The borders of the Sintashta-Petrovka cultural area run along the eastern Urals of the Eurasian steppe to about south of Chelyabinsk and to the east for about . 23 archaeological sites are recognized as being part of this area.

The sites resemble towns, laid out in round, square, or oval shapes. Although most of the sites have been discovered by aerial photography, only two, Arkaim and Sintashta, have been thoroughly excavated. These sites are characterized by their fortification, connected houses, and extensive evidence of metallurgy.

The people of the Sintashta culture are thought to have spoken Proto-Indo-Iranian, the ancestor of the Indo-Iranian language family. This identification is based primarily on similarities between their language in comparison to sections of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, and based on funerary rituals of the Sintashta culture, as revealed by archaeological studies in the area.

===Modern Russian history===
The fortress of Chelyaba, from which the city takes its name, was founded at the location of the Bashkir village of Chelyaby () by colonel Alexey (Kutlu-Muhammed) Tevkelev in 1736 to protect the surrounding trade routes from possible attacks by Bashkir outlaws. During Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion, the fortress withstood a siege by the rebel forces in 1774, but was eventually captured for several months in 1775. In 1782, Chelyabinsk became a seat of the uyezd of Ufa Viceroyalty, which was later reformed into Orenburg Governorate. In 1787, Chelyabinsk was granted town status by the government.

Until the late 19th century, Chelyabinsk was a small provincial town. In 1892, the Samara-Zlatoust Railway was completed, which connected it with Moscow and the rest of European Russia. Also in 1892, construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway started from Chelyabinsk, and in 1896, the city was linked to Ekaterinburg. Chelyabinsk then became the main hub for travel to Siberia. For 15 years, more than fifteen million people – a tenth of Russia&#x27;s population at the time – passed through Chelyabinsk. Some of them remained in Chelyabinsk, which contributed to its rapid growth. In addition, a so-called &quot;customs fracture&quot; was created in Chelyabinsk, which imposed duties on the shipment of goods between the European and Asian parts of Russia, which led to the emergence of mills and notably, a tea-packing factory. As a result, Chelyabinsk became a major trade center. Its population reached 20,000 inhabitants by 1897, 45,000 by 1913, and 70,000 by 1917. Because of its rapid growth at the turn of the 20th century, similar to that of midwestern American cities, Chelyabinsk was sometimes called &quot;the Chicago of the Urals&quot;.

During the first five-year plans of the 1930s, Chelyabinsk experienced rapid industrial growth. Several important factories, including the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant and the Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant, were built at this time. During World War II, Joseph Stalin decided to move a large part of Soviet manufacturing to areas removed from the reach of the advancing German military as part of a general exodus from western occupied areas. This brought new industries and thousands of workers to Chelyabinsk, including facilities for the production of T-34 tanks and Katyusha rocket launchers. During World War II, the city&#x27;s industries produced 18,000 tanks and 48,500 tank diesel engines as well as over 17 million units of ammunition. During that time Chelyabinsk was informally called &quot;Tankograd&quot; (&quot;Tank City&quot;). During World War II, the S.M. Kirov Factory no. 185 or &quot;OKMO&quot; was moved to Chelyabinsk from Leningrad to produce heavy tanks, although it was transferred to Omsk after 1962. 

===2013 meteor===

Shortly after dawn on 15 February 2013, a superbolide meteor descended at over over the Ural Mountains, exploding at an altitude of .

The meteor created a momentary flash as bright as the sun and generated a shock wave that injured over a thousand people. Fragments fell in and around Chelyabinsk. Interior Ministry spokesman Vadim Kolesnikov said 1,100 people had called for medical assistance following the incident, mostly for treatment of injuries from broken glass by the explosions. One woman suffered a broken spine. Kolesnikov also said about of a roof at a zinc factory had collapsed. A spokeswoman for the Emergency Ministry told the Associated Press that there was a meteor shower; however, another ministry spokeswoman was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying it was a single meteor. The size has been estimated at diameter with a mass of . The power of the explosion was about 500 kilotons of TNT (about 1.8 PJ), which is 20–30 times more energy than was released from the atomic bomb detonated in Hiroshima. The city avoided larger casualties and destruction due to the shallow entry angle of the meteor, which caused a relatively high altitude for the explosion and distributed its energy over a larger area.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Chelyabinsk is the administrative center of the oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the City of Chelyabinsk, an administrative unit with a status equal to that of the oblast&#x27;s districts. As a municipal division, the City of Chelyabinsk is incorporated as Chelyabinsky Urban Okrug. In June 2014, Chelyabinsk&#x27;s seven city districts were granted civil status.

===Administrative districts===
Chelyabinsk is divided into seven administrative districts.
== Geography ==
Chelyabinsk is located east of the Ural Mountains, south of Yekaterinburg. It is elevated above sea level.

The city is bisected by the Miass River, which is regarded as the border between the Urals and Siberia. This is reflected in the geology of the area, with the granite foothills of the Ural Mountains to the west and the lower sedimentary rock of the West Siberian Plain to the east.

The Leningrad Bridge crosses the river, due to this it is known as &quot;the bridge between the Urals and Siberia&quot;. Chelyabinsk itself is also known as &quot;the gateway to Siberia&quot;.

Like Rome, Constantinople, San Francisco and Moscow, Chelyabinsk is said to be located on seven hills.

===Urban layout===
The city of Chelyabinsk developed as a fortress. The first streets began to appear soon after the construction of the fortress on the right (southern) bank of the Miass River - already in September 1736. No residential buildings were built directly in the fortress itself; the houses of the inhabitants were located in the adjoining settlement, which was surrounded by a defensive wall. The very first street was formed between the northern wall of the fortress and the Miass River. A fragment of it is shown already in the foreground of the Chelyabinsk Fortress, attached by Colonel A.I. Tevkelev to his report to V.N. Tatishchev on 10 September 1736. Soon it received the name Sibirskaya (now Truda Street), since outside Chelyabinsk it crossed into the Siberian tract leading to Tobolsk. Apparently, there were also other names: in a number of sources it is called Bolshaya Beregovaya, as mentioned in a document dated 10 March 1753. The western end of the street in the last years of the 18th century acquired an independent name – on the pasture near the outskirts of the Ivanovo fair appeared. Apparently, according to it, this part of the street began to be called Sibirskaya-Ivanovskaya (as it is called in the list of 1795). Then, already in the 19th century, it was a little later upstream and downstream of the Miass (that is, west and east of the fortress). Perpendicular to the river, several more streets were planned. At first, there were four of them – two each on the western and eastern sides. The first street to the east got its name from the first Chelyabinsk church, consecrated in 1739 in honor of Nicholas the Wonderworker – Nikolayevskaya street (nowadays Sovetskaya). It was one-sided and went west towards the church and the fortress. After the Chelyabinsk fortress was assigned the status of the center of the Isetskaya province in 1743, the construction of administrative buildings began here, and another street was formed between Nikolaevskaya Street and the square with the church, ending in the south with the Orenburg Gate and continuing further after the then city limit by the road to Orenburg - Orenburgskaya (now Tsvillinga Street). On Orenburgskaya Street, in 1787 only four courtyards were counted, and in the list of 1795 it was already called Khristorozhdestvenskaya, and there were eleven courtyards on it. In the 18th and first half of the 19th century, Khristorozhdestvenskaya Street was the main street in the city, it was the place where its social and business life was concentrated. The urban planning on the territory of the historical center of Chelyabinsk almost without changes coincides with the plan of Chelyabinsk in 1838. The Chelyabinsk fortress was built in the center of this territory in 1736. The plan of 1784 was supposed to streamline not only the layout of the city but the development and maintenance of quarters. Along with the city center, a district center and a second city square are being laid in the riverside part. The plans of 1768 and 1784 were not carried out, though the existing Troitskaya Square, Truda Street and Tsvilinga Street are historical traces remained of them. In 1838, the land surveyor Sidorov drew up a new plan to streamline the city. In many ways, it was the starting point for the further development of the city.

By 1934, during the Soviet period and the mass industrialization, about 250 thousand people lived in the city. Large-scale urban planning tasks necessitated the development of the first master plan of the city, executed under the guidance of the architect N. G. Eismont in 1936 (Leningrad-based Russian State Research and Design Institute of Urbanism, architects N. G. Berlinerblau, S. M. Gotlib, N. V. Gromov, K. M. Zaichenko and A. M. Suborov). The estimated population according to the general plan of 1936 was to reach 550 thousand people. The city developed around the historical core, including by cutting down the island birch forest, in the planning of the central part, a rectangular grid of streets was preserved, but with the enlargement of quarters. The Metallurgichesky, Traktorozavodsky and Leninsky districts were built and developed with heavy industry. Along with the city center, the centers of 5 administrative districts were planned, and interconnected by a system of transport highways. The main street – Spartak Street (now Lenin Avenue) – appears as a link between the Traktorozavodsky district, Revolution Square, and the future ensemble of the pre-park square. Historically developed streets of Kirov and Zwilling connected the main square of the city with the system of squares in Zarechye. The master plan of 1936 provided for the creation of urban recreation areas on the basis of Shershnevsky Bor and Lake Smolino, for the first time the issue of creating a large reservoir on the Miass River (Shershnevskoye Reservoir) was raised. 

The war prevented the implementation of the master plan in full. The Chelyabinsk industrial complex has become a deep rear defense base of the country. The relocation of 60 industrial enterprises from the center of the country, and the evacuation of the population were accompanied by mass construction of isolated villages from barracks and dugouts in free territories. At the same time, the urban area has grown significantly. The need to streamline the development of the post-war city is one of the driving reasons for the development of a new master plan, carried out in 1947 under the leadership of D. D. Bagarin (Lengiprogor, architects A. Slonimsky, L. Vertousov, engineers J. Rotenberg, I. Benevich and others). The second general plan is designed for a city with a population of more than 700 thousand people (in 1946, 450 thousand people lived in the city). Chelyabinsk was considered a center of energy-intensive production, so the main attention was paid to the formation of four industrial hubs based on the capacities of existing enterprises. The main architectural and planning idea was the unification of disparate parts of the city into a single organism – was transferred from the general plan of the pre-war period. Along with the territory of the districts that had reserves for development (Traktorozavodsky – towards Lake First, Metallurgical – with partial use of the territory of Kashtaksky Bor, Leninsky – to Lake Smolino), new sites for promising construction were envisaged (North-West and Churilovo). The issues of transport construction were actively resolved: the creation of a bypass ring highway connecting the city districts, the routing of the main highways from east to west (Pobedy Avenue, Khudyakov – Dzerzhinsky) and from north to south (&quot;Meridian&quot; and Tchaikovsky Street) with access to the main roads beyond outside the city. In 1951, the master plan was adjusted in terms of the number of floors of the building: the share of multi-storey (up to five floors) buildings increased by reducing the share of 2-storey and estate buildings to 25%. 

The third master plan of the city in 1967 was developed by a team of authors from the Chelyabinskgrazhdanproekt Institute. The city had a population of 857,000. The main architectural and planning idea was the active inclusion in the composition of the city of Shershnevsky and Kashtak forests, the Shershnevsky reservoir and the Miass River. Building on the free territories of the northwestern residential area, designed for a population of up to 300 thousand people, as a new direction for the development of the city, proposed by the master plan, has been carried out since the late 1960s. The existing historically polycentric system of the center was enriched by the creation of new complexes: at the turn of the river near Garden Island, along Tchaikovsky Street, and the three-beam center of the northwest. The master plan of 1967 provided for the creation of new main streets and a ring road, and the construction of bridges and overpasses, which were planned to free the city center from transit traffic. In 1990 a new city plan was approved and again in 2021.

===Climate===
The city has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) similar to that of the Canadian prairies, despite being located slightly further north. The average temperature in January is well below the freezing point at . July has a relatively warm average of , and the annual average is a few degrees above the freezing point at , indicating some moderation. The range of extremes allegedly reaches , claimed to be typical of a mid-latitude climate on a large continent such as Eurasia.

The majority of precipitation occurs in the summer, with less in the winter. The month of July experiences the most, with an average of precipitation, while January, the driest month, experiences . Total precipitation reaches an average of annually, consistent with the city&#x27;s semi-arid influence. On average, 119 days of the year experience precipitation.

==Cityscape==
===Architecture===

The architecture of Chelyabinsk has been shaped through its history by the progression of historical eras in Russia. Before the 1917 Russian Revolution, the city was a trading center, with numerous merchant buildings in the eclectic and modern styles with elements of Russian Revival architecture, some of which are preserved on the pedestrian-only Kirovka Street.
Industrialization in Chelyabinsk started in the late 1920s. The construction of large plants was accompanied by the construction of new residential and public buildings (like the city&#x27;s main post office) in the constructivist style. Entire constructivist neighborhoods can be seen in the area of the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant.

In the late 1930s, a new era began in the city, with large-scale construction of Stalinist architecture. Many of the buildings in and around the city center and central avenue are constructed in this style.

The next 60 years saw extensive construction of residential high-rise buildings as the city&#x27;s population rose to about one million, notably within the large residential area called &quot;Severo-Zapad&quot; (&quot;North-West&quot;).

With the market reforms of the 1990s, there was an increase in the construction of office buildings and major shopping malls in postmodern and high-tech styles.

===Parks and gardens===
Chelyabinsk has 17 public parks. The largest is Gagarin Central Park. Its territory includes large areas of rocky and forested terrain, located around several now-flooded abandoned quarries.

<text>Waking Life is a 2001 American adult animated drama film written and directed by Richard Linklater. The film explores a wide range of philosophical issues, including the nature of reality, dreams and lucid dreams, consciousness, the meaning of life, free will, and existentialism. The series of insightful philosophical discussions at the core of the film are progressed by a young man who wanders through a succession of dreamlike realities wherein he encounters a series of interesting characters.

The entire film was digitally rotoscoped. It contains several parallels to Linklater&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;Slacker&quot;. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy reprise their characters from &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; (1995) in one scene. &quot;Waking Life&quot; premiered at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival, and was released on October 19, 2001, where it received critical acclaim; however, it underperformed at the box office.

==Plot==
An unnamed young man lives an ethereal existence that lacks transitions between everyday events and eventually progresses toward an existential crisis. He observes quietly but later participates actively in philosophical discussions involving other characters — ranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurant-goers and friends — about such issues as metaphysics, free will, social philosophy, and the meaning of life. Other scenes do not even include the protagonist&#x27;s presence but rather focus on a random isolated person, a group of people, or a couple engaging in such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way, the film also touches upon existentialism, situationist politics, posthumanity, the film theory of André Bazin, and lucid dreaming, and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name.

Gradually, the protagonist begins to realize that he is living out a perpetual dream, broken up only by occasional false awakenings. So far, he is mostly a passive onlooker, though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she greets him and shares her creative ideas with him, he reminds himself that she is a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterward, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters, but he begins to despair about being trapped in a dream.

The protagonist&#x27;s final talk is with a character (played by Richard Linklater) whom he briefly encountered previously in the film. This last conversation reveals this other character&#x27;s view that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time (and, thus, life); that living is simply the individual&#x27;s constant negation of God&#x27;s invitation to become one with the universe; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life, the individual need only accept God&#x27;s invitation.

The protagonist is last seen walking into a driveway when he suddenly begins to levitate, paralleling a scene at the start of the film of a floating child in the same driveway. The protagonist uncertainly reaches toward a car&#x27;s handle but is too swiftly lifted above the vehicle and over the trees. He rises into the endless blue expanse of the sky until he disappears from view.

==Cast==
*Wiley Wiggins plays the protagonist.

The film features appearances from a wide range of actors and non-actors, including:

* Eamonn Healy
* Timothy &quot;Speed&quot; Levitch
* Adam Goldberg
* Nicky Katt
* Ethan Hawke as Jesse
* Julie Delpy as Céline
* Steven Prince
* Caveh Zahedi
* Otto Hofmann
* Richard Linklater
* Alex Jones
* Kim Krizan
* Louis H. Mackey
* Steven Soderbergh
* David Sosa
* Robert C. Solomon
* Steve Brudniak
==Production==
In a 2001 interview, Linklater estimated that the idea for the film came &quot;before I was even interested in film, probably 20 years ago.&quot; For a while he felt the idea for the film &quot;didn&#x27;t quite work&quot; calling it &quot;too blunt, too realistic&quot; stating that &quot;I think to make a realistic film about an unreality the film had to be a realistic unreality&quot;. To create that visual effect, Linklater used an animation technique based on rotoscoping, in which animators overlaid the live-action footage shot by Linklater with animation that roughly approximates the images actually filmed. Linklater employed a variety of artists, so the movie&#x27;s feel continually changes, producing a surreal, shifting dreamscape.

The animators used standard Apple Macintosh computers. The film was mostly produced using Rotoshop, a rotoscoping program that creates blends between key frame vector shapes, which also uses virtual &quot;layers&quot;, designed specifically for the production by Bob Sabiston. Linklater used this animation method again for his 2006 film &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Waking Life&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2001 and was given a limited release in the United States on October 19, 2001.

===Reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 81% based on 145 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Waking Life&quot;″s inventive animated aesthetic adds a distinctive visual component to a film that could easily have rested on its smart screenplay and talented ensemble cast.&quot; On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the film has a score of 82 out of 100 based on 31 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars out of four, describing it as &quot;a cold shower of bracing, clarifying ideas&quot;. Ebert later included the film on his list of &quot;Great Movies&quot;. Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; awarded the film an &quot;A&quot; rating, calling it &quot;a work of cinematic art in which form and structure pursue the logic-defying (parallel) subjects of dreaming and moviegoing,&quot; while Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote it was &quot;so verbally dexterous and visually innovative that you can&#x27;t absorb it unless you have all your wits about you&quot;. Dave Kehr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found the film to be &quot;lovely, fluid, funny&quot; and stated that it &quot;never feels heavy or over-ambitious&quot;.

Conversely, J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; felt that &quot;Waking Life&quot; &quot;doesn&#x27;t leave you in a dream... so much as it traps you in an endless bull session&quot;. Frank Lovece felt the film was &quot;beautifully drawn&quot; but called its content &quot;pedantic navel-gazing&quot;.

In 2018, Richard Linklater addressed the potentially controversial inclusion of Alex Jones in the film. In an interview with IndieWire, Linklater states, &quot;I just thought he was kind of funny.&quot; He notes that he never imagined Jones would one day be taken seriously and that at the time, he did not think much of including him.

Nominated for numerous awards, mainly for its technical achievements, &quot;Waking Life&quot; won the National Society of Film Critics award for &quot;Best Experimental Film&quot;, the New York Film Critics Circle award for &quot;Best Animated Film&quot;, and the &quot;CinemAvvenire&quot; award at the Venice Film Festival for &quot;Best Film&quot;. It was also nominated for the Golden Lion, the festival&#x27;s main award.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2008 – AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10: Nominated Animation Film

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS and DVD in North America in May 2002. DVD special features included several commentaries, documentaries, interviews, trailers, and deleted scenes, as well as the short film &quot;Snack and Drink&quot;. A bare-bones DVD with no special features was released in Region 2 in February 2003. A Blu-Ray was released in Germany and the UK.

==Soundtrack==

The &quot;Waking Life OST&quot; was performed and written by Glover Gill and the Tosca Tango Orchestra, except for Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2. The soundtrack was relatively successful. Featuring the nuevo tango style, it bills itself &quot;the 21st Century Tango&quot;. The tango contributions were influenced by the music of the Argentine &quot;father of new tango&quot; Astor Piazzolla.

<doc id="244755" wikidata="Q330955" url="?curid=244755" title="Sense and reference">
<text>In the philosophy of language, the distinction between sense and reference was an idea of the German philosopher and mathematician Gottlob Frege in 1892 (in his paper &quot;On Sense and Reference&quot;; German: &quot;Über Sinn und Bedeutung&quot;), reflecting the two ways he believed a singular term may have meaning.

The reference (or &quot;referent&quot;; &quot;Bedeutung&quot;) of a &quot;proper name&quot; is the object it means or indicates (&quot;bedeuten&quot;), whereas its sense (&quot;Sinn&quot;) is what the name expresses. The reference of a &quot;sentence&quot; is its truth value, whereas its sense is the thought that it expresses. Frege justified the distinction in a number of ways.
#Sense is something possessed by a name, whether or not it has a reference. For example, the name &quot;Odysseus&quot; is intelligible, and therefore has a sense, even though there is no individual object (its reference) to which the name corresponds.
#The sense of different names is different, even when their reference is the same. Frege argued that if an identity statement such as &quot;Hesperus is the same planet as Phosphorus&quot; is to be informative, the proper names flanking the identity sign must have a different meaning or sense. But clearly, if the statement is true, they must have the same reference. The sense is a &#x27;mode of presentation&#x27;, which serves to illuminate only a single aspect of the referent.

Much of analytic philosophy is traceable to Frege&#x27;s philosophy of language. Frege&#x27;s views on logic (i.e., his idea that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the arguments of a mathematical function) led to his views on a theory of reference.

==Background==
Frege developed his original theory of meaning in early works like &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; (concept paper) of 1879 and &quot;Grundlagen&quot; (Foundations of Arithmetic) of 1884. On this theory, the meaning of a complete sentence consists in its being true or false, and the meaning of each significant expression in the sentence is an extralinguistic entity which Frege called its &quot;Bedeutung&quot;, literally meaning or significance, but rendered by Frege&#x27;s translators as reference, referent, &#x27;Meaning&#x27;, nominatum, etc. Frege supposed that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the arguments of a mathematical function, but that other parts are incomplete, and contain an empty place, by analogy with the function itself. Thus &quot;Caesar conquered Gaul&quot; divides into the complete term &quot;Caesar&quot;, whose reference is Caesar himself, and the incomplete term &quot;—conquered Gaul&quot;, whose reference is a concept. Only when the empty place is filled by a proper name does the reference of the completed sentence – its truth value – appear. This early theory of meaning explains how the significance or reference of a sentence (its truth value) depends on the significance or reference of its parts.

==Sense==
Frege introduced the notion of &quot;sense&quot; (German: &quot;Sinn&quot;) to accommodate difficulties in his early theory of meaning.

First, if the entire significance of a sentence consists of its truth value, it follows that the sentence will have the same significance if we replace a word of the sentence with one having an identical reference, as this will not change its truth value. The reference of the whole is determined by the reference of the parts. If &quot;the evening star&quot; has the same reference as &quot;the morning star&quot;, it follows that &quot;the evening star is a body illuminated by the Sun&quot; has the same truth value as &quot;the morning star is a body illuminated by the Sun&quot;. But it is possible for someone to think that the first sentence is true while also thinking that the second is false. Therefore, the thought corresponding to each sentence cannot be its reference, but something else, which Frege called its &quot;sense&quot;.

Second, sentences that contain proper names with no reference cannot have a truth value at all. Yet the sentence &#x27;Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep&#x27; obviously has a sense, even though &#x27;Odysseus&#x27; has no reference. The thought remains the same whether or not &#x27;Odysseus&#x27; has a reference. Furthermore, a thought cannot contain the objects that it is about. For example, Mont Blanc, &#x27;with its snowfields&#x27;, cannot be a component of the thought that Mont Blanc is more than 4,000 metres high. Nor can a thought about Etna contain lumps of solidified lava.

Frege&#x27;s notion of sense is somewhat obscure, and neo-Fregeans have come up with different candidates for its role. Accounts based on the work of Carnap and Church treat sense as an intension, or a function from possible worlds to extensions. For example, the intension of ‘number of planets’ is a function that maps any possible world to the number of planets in that world. John McDowell supplies cognitive and reference-determining roles. Michael Devitt treats senses as causal-historical chains connecting names to referents, allowing that repeated &quot;groundings&quot; in an object account for reference change.

==Sense and description==
In his theory of descriptions, Bertrand Russell held the view that most proper names in ordinary language are in fact disguised definite descriptions. For example, &#x27;Aristotle&#x27; can be understood as &quot;The pupil of Plato and teacher of Alexander&quot;, or by some other uniquely applying description. This is known as the descriptivist theory of names. Because Frege used definite descriptions in many of his examples, he is often taken to have endorsed the descriptivist theory. Thus Russell&#x27;s theory of descriptions was conflated with Frege&#x27;s theory of sense, and for most of the twentieth century this &quot;Frege–Russell&quot; view was the orthodox view of proper name semantics. Saul Kripke argued influentially against the descriptivist theory, asserting that proper names are rigid designators which designate the same object in every possible world. Descriptions, however, such as &quot;the President of the U.S. in 1969&quot; do not designate the same entity in every possible world. For example, someone other than Richard Nixon, e.g. Hubert H. Humphrey, might have been the President in 1969. Hence a description (or cluster of descriptions) cannot be a rigid designator, and thus a proper name cannot &quot;mean&quot; the same as a description.

However, the Russellian descriptivist reading of Frege has been rejected by many scholars, in particular by Gareth Evans in &quot;The Varieties of Reference&quot; and by John McDowell in &quot;The Sense and Reference of a Proper Name&quot;, following Michael Dummett, who argued that Frege&#x27;s notion of sense should not be equated with a description. Evans further developed this line, arguing that a sense without a referent was not possible. He and McDowell both take the line that Frege&#x27;s discussion of empty names, and of the idea of sense without reference, are inconsistent, and that his apparent endorsement of descriptivism rests only on a small number of imprecise and perhaps offhand remarks. And both point to the power that the sense-reference distinction &quot;does&quot; have (i.e., to solve at least the first two problems), even if it is not given a descriptivist reading.

==Translation of &quot;Bedeutung&quot;==
As noted above, translators of Frege have rendered the German &quot;Bedeutung&quot; in various ways. The term &#x27;reference&#x27; has been the most widely adopted, but this fails to capture the meaning of the original German (&#x27;meaning&#x27; or &#x27;significance&#x27;), and does not reflect the decision to standardise key terms across different editions of Frege&#x27;s works published by Blackwell. The decision was based on the principle of exegetical neutrality: that &quot;if at any point in a text there is a passage that raises for the native speaker legitimate questions of exegesis, then, if at all possible, a translator should strive to confront the reader of his version with the same questions of exegesis and not produce a version which in his mind resolves those questions&quot;. The term &#x27;meaning&#x27; best captures the standard German meaning of &quot;Bedeutung&quot;. However, while Frege&#x27;s own use of the term can sound as odd in German for modern readers as when translated into English, the related term &quot;deuten&quot; does mean &#x27;to point towards&#x27;. Though &quot;Bedeutung&quot; is not usually used with this etymological proximity in mind in German, German speakers can well make sense of &quot;Bedeutung&quot; as signifying &#x27;reference&#x27;, in the sense of it being what &quot;Bedeutung&quot; points, i.e. refers to. Moreover, &#x27;meaning&#x27; captures Frege&#x27;s early use of &quot;Bedeutung&quot; well, and it would be problematic to translate Frege&#x27;s early use as &#x27;meaning&#x27; and his later use as &#x27;reference&#x27;, suggesting a change in terminology not evident in the original German.

==Precursors==
===Antisthenes===
The Greek philosopher Antisthenes, a pupil of Socrates, apparently distinguished &quot;a general object that can be aligned with the meaning of the utterance” from “a particular object of extensional reference&quot;. According to Susan Prince, this &quot;suggests that he makes a distinction between sense and reference&quot;. The principal basis of Prince&#x27;s claim is a passage in Alexander of Aphrodisias&#x27; “Comments on Aristotle&#x27;s &#x27;Topics&#x27;” with a three-way distinction: 
# the semantic medium, δι&#x27; ὧν λέγουσι
# an object external to the semantic medium, περὶ οὗ λέγουσιν
# the direct indication of a thing, σημαίνειν ... τὸ ...

===Stoicism===
The Stoic doctrine of refers to a correspondence between speech and the object referred to in speech, as distinct from the speech itself. British classicist R. W. Sharples cites &quot;lekta&quot; as an anticipation of the distinction between sense and reference.

===John Stuart Mill===
The sense-reference distinction is commonly confused with that between connotation and denotation, which originates with John Stuart Mill. According to Mill, a common term like &#x27;white&#x27; &quot;denotes&quot; all white things, as snow, paper. But according to Frege, a common term does not refer to any individual white thing, but rather to an abstract concept (). We must distinguish between the relation of reference, which holds between a proper name and the object it refers to, such as between the name &#x27;Earth&#x27; and the planet Earth, and the relation of &#x27;falling under&#x27;, such as when the Earth falls under the concept &quot;planet&quot;. The relation of a proper name to the object it designates is direct, whereas a word like &#x27;planet&#x27; does not have such a direct relation to the Earth; instead, it refers to a concept under which the Earth falls. Moreover, judging of anything that it falls under this concept is not in any way part of our knowledge of what the word &#x27;planet&#x27; means. The distinction between connotation and denotation is closer to that between concept and object than to that between &#x27;sense&#x27; and &#x27;reference&#x27;.

<text>Kim Criswell (born July 19, 1957) is an American musical entertainer and actress.

== Life and career ==
Criswell was born in Hampton, Virginia, United States, and grew up in Chattanooga, Tennessee. After she graduated from Hixson High School in suburban Chattanooga, she studied musical theatre at the University of Cincinnati&#x27;s College Conservatory of Music. She then moved to New York City where she landed a role in the touring company of &quot;Annie&quot;. She made her Broadway debut in &quot;The First&quot; in 1981. She has been in numerous musicals and has appeared with some of America&#x27;s leading symphony orchestras as the featured soloist. She won the Helen Hayes Award in 1989 for her 1988 performance in &quot;Side By Side By Sondheim&quot; at the Olney Theatre in Washington.

In September 1991, she presented her one-woman show &quot;Doin What Comes Naturally&quot;, at the Shaw Theatre in London. She has lived in London since 1992, when she was invited to play Annie Oakley in Irving Berlin&#x27;s musical &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;.

On August 1, 2009, she was a featured soloist in the &quot;BBC Proms 2009: a Celebration of Classic MGM Film Musicals&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall. On that evening she performed a number of songs including: &quot;The Trolley Song&quot;, &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Get Happy&quot; all originally made famous by Judy Garland. She additionally performed the songs &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot; (also in Garland&#x27;s repertoire) and &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; in a duet with Seth MacFarlane. On October 4, 2009, she was a featured artist at the &quot;Broadway to West End&quot; Gala in the Theatre Royal Drury Lane. She repeated her Proms Concert success when she appeared in a Rodgers and Hammerstein evening, once again with the John Wilson Orchestra at The Royal Albert Hall with opera singer Rod Gilfry in August 2010.

In January 2012, she performed at Vienna&#x27;s Volksoper, starring in Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;.

<text>Philip James Stradling Williams (11 January 1939 – 10 June 2003) was a Welsh politician for Plaid Cymru and scientist.

==Background==
Williams was born in Tredegar in the industrial valleys of south Wales and grew up in Bargoed, another industrial town. He was educated at Lewis School, Pengam and Clare College, Cambridge, and became a leading space scientist. He was appointed Professor of Solar Terrestrial Physics at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, and simultaneously became economic spokesman for Plaid Cymru.

==Political career==
He contested the 1968 Caerphilly by-election, where he came close to unseating Labour in a safe seat, and became the second Chairman of Plaid Cymru in 1970, a post he held until 1976; when he became vice president of the party. He was responsible for policy and research in the party for many years.

From 1999 to 2003, he was a Member of the National Assembly for Wales for the electoral region of South Wales East. Williams also stood for election in Blaenau Gwent in 1999 and got 21% of the vote.

==Return to science and death==
He stood down as an Assembly Member in 2003 to work on a research project to study the inner workings of the sun from the observatory near the North Pole. In 2001, he was voted Welsh Politician of the Year, and he was being pressured by former colleagues to become the next president of his party, following the resignation of Ieuan Wyn Jones as president. Shortly after standing down from the Welsh Assembly he suffered a heart attack while visiting a massage parlour in Cardiff and was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.

<doc id="244773" wikidata="Q5374736" url="?curid=244773" title="Empty name">
<text>In metaphysics and the philosophy of language, an empty name is a proper name that has no referent.

The problem of empty names is the idea that empty names have a meaning when it seems they should not have. The name &quot;Pegasus&quot; is empty; there is nothing to which it refers. Yet, though there is no Pegasus, we know what the sentence &quot;Pegasus has two wings&quot; means. We can even understand the sentence &quot;There is no such thing as Pegasus.&quot; But, what can the meaning of a proper name be, except the object to which it refers?

==Overview==
There are three broad ways which philosophers have tried to approach this problem.

# The meaning of a proper name is not the same as the object (if there is any) it refers to. Hence, though &quot;Pegasus&quot; refers to nothing, it still has a meaning. The German philosopher Gottlob Frege seems to have held a theory of this sort. He says that the sentence Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep&#x27; obviously has a sense. ...the thought [expressed by that sentence] remains the same whether &#x27;Odysseus&#x27; has reference or not.&quot; Bertrand Russell may also have held a similar theory, that a proper name is a disguised definite description that signifies some unique characteristic. If any object has this characteristic feature, the name has a referent. Otherwise it is empty. Perhaps &quot;Aristotle&quot; means &quot;the teacher of Alexander&quot;. Since there was such a person, &quot;Aristotle&quot; refers to that person. By contrast, &quot;Pegasus&quot; may mean &quot;the winged horse of Bellerophon&quot;. Since there was no such horse, the name has no referent. This is the so-called description theory of names. The difficulty with this account is that we may always use a proper name to deny that the individual bearing the name actually has some characteristic feature. So, we can meaningfully say that Aristotle was not the teacher of Alexander. But if &quot;Aristotle&quot; &quot;means&quot; &quot;teacher of Alexander&quot;, it would follow that this assertion is self-contradictory, which it is not. Saul Kripke proposed this argument in a series of influential papers in the 1970s. Another difficulty is that different people may have different ideas about the defining characteristics of any individual. Yet we all understand what the name means. The sole information carried by the name seems to be the identity of the individual that it belongs to. This information therefore cannot be descriptive, it cannot describe the individual. As John Stuart Mill argued, a proper name tells us the identity of its bearer, without telling us anything else about it. Naming is rather like &quot;pointing&quot;.
# A theory that became influential following Kripke&#x27;s attack is that empty proper names, have, strictly speaking, no meaning. This is the so-called direct-reference theory. Versions of this theory have been defended by Keith Donnellan, David Kaplan, Nathan Salmon, Scott Soames and others. The problem with the direct-reference theory is that names appear to be meaningful independently of whether they are empty. Furthermore, negative existential statements using empty names are both true and apparently meaningful. How can &quot;Pegasus does not exist&quot; be true if the name &quot;Pegasus&quot;, as used in that sentence, has no meaning?
# There are no empty names. All names have a referent. The difficulty with this theory is how to distinguish names like &quot;Pegasus&quot; from names like &quot;Aristotle&quot;. Any coherent account of this distinction seems to require that there are objects that do not exist. Given that &quot;Pegasus does not exist&quot; is true, it follows that the referent of &quot;Pegasus&quot; does not exist. Hence there is something—the referent of &quot;Pegasus&quot;—that does not exist. Some philosophers, such as Alexius Meinong have argued that there are two senses of the verb &quot;exists&quot;, exemplified by the sentence &quot;there are things that do not exist&quot;. The first, signified by &quot;there are&quot;, is the so-called &quot;wide sense&quot;, including Pegasus, the golden mountain, the round square, and so on. The second, signified by &quot;exist&quot; is the so-called &quot;narrow sense&quot;, encompassing only things that are real or existent.

== Fictional entities ==
Some philosophers employ the related concepts of &quot;fictional entities&quot; (such as Sherlock Holmes) who are deliberate inventions, and of &quot;mythical entities&quot; (such as Vulcan) that result from accidental mistakes. Such entities appear to be employed in many different contexts:
* Discourse within fiction: The story itself saying that &quot;[Holmes was] the most perfect reasoning and observing machine&quot;
* Intra-fictional discourse by readers: &quot;Holmes solved his first mystery while in college&quot;
* Inter-fictional discourse by readers: &quot;Holmes is even smarter than Batman&quot;
* Nonexistence claims: &quot;Sherlock Holmes does not exist&quot;
* Discourse about the entity &quot;as&quot; a fictional entity: &quot;Holmes is a fictional character&quot;

<doc id="244774" wikidata="Q109411" url="?curid=244774" title="Curse">
<text>A curse (also called an imprecation, malediction, execration, malison, [[anathema]], or commination) is any expressed wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall or attach to one or more persons, a place, or an object. In particular, &quot;curse&quot; may refer to such a wish or pronouncement made effective by a supernatural or spiritual power, such as a god or gods, a spirit, or a natural force, or else as a kind of spell by magic (usually black magic) or witchcraft; in the latter sense, a curse can also be called a hex or a [[jinx]]. In many belief systems, the curse itself (or accompanying ritual) is considered to have some causative force in the result. To reverse or eliminate a curse is sometimes called &quot;removal&quot; or &quot;breaking&quot;, as the spell has to be dispelled, and often requires elaborate rituals or prayers.

== Types==

The study of the forms of curses comprises a significant proportion of the study of both folk religion and folklore. The deliberate attempt to levy curses is often part of the practice of magic. In Hindu culture, the Sage or Rishi is believed to have the power to bless (&quot;Āshirvada&quot; or &quot;Vara&quot;) and curse (&quot;Shaapa&quot;). Examples include the curse placed by Rishi Bhrigu on king Nahusha and the one placed by Rishi Devala.
Special names for specific types of curses can be found in various cultures:

* African American hoodoo presents us with the jinx and crossed conditions, as well as a form of foot track magic which was used by Ramandeep, whereby cursed objects are laid in the paths of victims and activated when walked over.
* Middle Eastern and Mediterranean culture is the source of the belief in the evil eye, which may be the result of envy or, more rarely, is said to be the result of a deliberate curse. In order to be protected from the evil eye, a protection item is made from dark blue circular glass, with a circle of white around the black dot in the middle, which is reminiscent of a human eye. The size of the protective eye item may vary.
* German people, including the Pennsylvania Dutch, speak in terms of hexing (from , the German word for doing witchcraft), and a common hex in days past was that laid by a stable-witch who caused milk cows to go dry and horses to go lame.

==Egyptians and mummies==

There is a broad popular belief in curses being associated with the violation of the tombs of mummified corpses, or of the mummies themselves. The idea became so widespread as to become a pop-culture mainstay, especially in horror films (though originally the curse was invisible, a series of mysterious deaths, rather than the walking-dead mummies of later fiction). The &quot;Curse of the Pharaohs&quot; is supposed to have haunted the archeologists who excavated the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, whereby an imprecation was supposedly pronounced from the grave by the ancient Egyptian priests, on anyone who violated its precincts. Similar dubious suspicions have surrounded the excavation and examination of the (natural, not embalmed) Alpine mummy, &quot;Ötzi the Iceman&quot;. While such curses are generally considered to have been popularized and sensationalized by British journalists of the 19th century, ancient Egyptians were, in fact, known to place curse inscriptions on markers protecting temple or tomb goods or property.

==In the Bible==
According to the Catholic Encyclopedia article &quot;Cursing&quot;, the Bible depicts God cursing the serpent, the earth, and Cain (, , ). Similarly, Noah curses Canaan (), and Joshua curses any man who should [re]build the city of Jericho (). In various books of the Hebrew Bible, there are long lists of curses against transgressors of the Law (, , etc.). The 10 Plagues of Egypt, preceding the 10 Commandments, can be seen as curses cast from the rods of Aaron and Moses acting on instruction from the God of Israel, in order to enable the enthralled to come free from the yoke of enforced serfdom, slavery and the like.

In the New Testament, Christ curses the barren fig tree (), pronounces his denunciation of woe against the incredulous cities (), against the rich, the worldly, the scribes, and the Pharisees, and foretells the awful malediction that is to come upon the damned (). The word curse is also applied to the victim of expiation for sin (Galatians 3:13), to sins temporal and eternal (; ).

==Objects==
Cursed objects are generally supposed to have been stolen from their rightful owners or looted from a sanctuary. The Hope Diamond is supposed to bear such a curse, and bring misfortune to its owner. The stories behind why these items are cursed vary, but they usually are said to bring bad luck or to manifest unusual phenomena related to their presence. Busby&#x27;s stoop chair was reportedly cursed by the murderer Thomas Busby shortly before his execution so that everyone who would sit in it would die.

According to the Bible, cursed objects are those which are used in idolatry whether that idolatry is indirectly or directly connected to the devil. A list of those Bible references along with a comprehensive list of occult and cursed objects can be found online.

==Bishop Dunbar&#x27;s curse==

In 1525 Gavin Dunbar, Archbishop of Glasgow, Scotland, pronounced a curse on the Anglo-Scottish Border reivers and caused it to be read out in all churches in the border area. It comprehensively cursed the reivers and their families from head to toe and in every way. In 2003 a 371-word extract from the curse was carved into a 14-ton granite boulder as part of an art work by Gordon Young which was installed in Carlisle; some local people believed that a series of misfortunes (floods, factory closure, footballing defeats etc.) were caused by the curse, and campaigned unsuccessfully for the destruction of the stone.

==As a plot device==
Curses have also been used as plot devices in literature and theater. When used as a plot device, they involve one character placing a curse or hex over another character. This is distinguished from adverse spells and premonitions and other such plot devices. Examples of the curse as a plot device:
* &quot;Rigoletto&quot; – Count Monterone places a curse on Rigoletto. Rigoletto blames the climactic death of his daughter on the curse.
* &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;-In the second act the vengeful spirit of Thuy tortures and torments Kim in her visions and utters a curse on her that Chris will desert and abandon her and blaming her for his death.
* &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; – A dying Mercutio curses the Montagues and Capulets with &quot;A plague o&#x27; both your houses.&quot; (Often quoted as &quot;a pox on both your houses.&quot;)
* &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; – Evil fairy Carabosse (Maleficent in the Disney film) casts a curse on Princess Aurora to die on her 16th birthday.
* &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; – A fairy punishes a conceited prince by transforming him into a hideous beast.
* &quot;The Six Swans&quot; (and variants) – a mother curses her six (seven, twelve) sons into bird form, and their sister must sew magic shirts to reverse the transformation
* &quot;Shrek&quot; – Princess Fiona was cursed to be human by day, but ogre by night.
* &quot;Resident Evil Village&quot; – Ethan Winters after a bloody duel with Lady Dimitrescu tormenting and taunting him that he will never see his daughter Rose again and utters a curse on him before disintegrates and calcifies to her death.
* &quot;Drag Me To Hell&quot; – Christine Brown was cursed by Sylvia Ganush to experience three days of torture, then the lamia will drag her to hell.
* &quot;Someone Behind You&quot; – Ga-in finds herself being the target of an ancient family curse fearing that her family and friends are out to kill her.
* &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure: JoJolion&quot; – The Higashikata Family is cursed to have the firstborn son turn into stone at the age of 10.

==Sports==

A number of curses are used to explain the failures or misfortunes of specific sports teams, players, or even cities. For example:
* No first-time winner of the World Snooker Championship has successfully defended his title since the event was first held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield in 1977. This has been widely attributed to a Crucible Curse.
* The Curse of the Billy Goat was used to explain the failures of the Chicago Cubs baseball team, who did not win a World Series championship between 1908 and 2016, and a National League pennant between 1945 and 2016.
* The Curse of the Bambino is a cliche popularized by a Boston Globe sportswriter to describe a decades-long championship drought for the Boston Red Sox team in Major League Baseball. &quot;Bambino&quot; was a nickname for Babe Ruth, the team&#x27;s star when Boston won the last three of its first five World Series titles. In 1920, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to his team&#x27;s archrival New York Yankees, which won four World Series with him. It took Boston 86 years to win another World Series. The Red Sox reversed history in the 2004 American League Championship Series (ALCS), losing the first three games of a best-of-seven series against the Yankees before winning four in a row to take the league pennant in unprecedented and dramatic style. This comeback is considered one of the greatest in sports history. The Red Sox then swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series in four games, a triumph which many fans considered the end of the &quot;curse.&quot; The Red Sox have won three more World Series since then.
* The Krukow Kurse was used to explain the San Francisco Giants&#x27; failure to ever win the World Series until 2010. It is attributed to Mike Krukow (a former pitcher for the Giants and a current broadcaster for the team) based upon his yearly pre-season predictions that the Giants &quot;have a chance&quot; to win the World Series. Once Krukow stops making such predictions—says the legend—the Giants will, in fact, win the World Series. However, the Giants went on to win the World Series in 2010. It was during the same year that Krukow&#x27;s partner, Giants broadcaster, Duane Kuiper, stated, &quot;Giants baseball, it&#x27;s torture!&quot;, due to the large number of close games that they played. This phrase was adopted by fans and became a rallying cry throughout the second half of the season and the playoff run.
* The Curse of the Colonel was supposedly cast on the Hanshin Tigers by Colonel Harland Sanders (the founder and mascot of Kentucky Fried Chicken) after fans of the team threw his statue into the Dōtonbori Canal while celebrating the Tigers&#x27; 1985 Japan Championship Series, not to be recovered until 2009. The curse was broken in 2023 when the Tigers won Game 7 of the 2023 Japan Series for their first NPB championship since 1985.
* Marketing experts have highlighted the curse of Gillette, given the mishaps that happen to sports stars associated with the brand.

<doc id="244779" wikidata="Q5669524" url="?curid=244779" title="Harry Harrison (DJ)">
<text>Harry M. Harrison (September 20, 1930 – January 28, 2020) was an American radio personality, primarily in New York City, for over 50 years. Harrison is the only disc jockey to be a WMCA &quot;Good Guy&quot;, a WABC &quot;All-American&quot;, and a personality on WCBS-FM&#x27;s oldies format. Harrison retired in June 2005. He was known as New York&#x27;s &quot;Morning Mayor&quot; after having hosted morning drive time through most of his career.

== Early ==
Harry M. Harrison was born on September 20, 1930, in Chicago to Harry Harrison and Mary (McKenna) Harrison. He attended a seminary with the intention of becoming a priest. Bedridden with rheumatic fever for nearly a year, he kept his ear glued to the radio, which decided him on a broadcasting career. He began his radio career at WCFL in 1953, later hosting a morning show at WPEO in Peoria, Illinois, before moving to New York City.

==Career==
===WCFL, Chicago, Illinois (1953–1954)===
Harrison worked at WCFL 1000 AM as a summer replacement, yet remained there eight months, substituting for the permanent DJs.

===WPEO, Peoria, Illinois (1954–1959)===
Harrison became program director at WPEO, Peoria and hosted the morning show as the &quot;Morning Mayor of Peoria.&quot; In just six months, Harrison made WPEO the top station.

===WMCA, New York (1959–1968)===
In 1959, Harrison joined WMCA 570 AM, New York, as the midday &quot;Good Guy.&quot; (WMCA disc jockeys were dubbed Good Guys.) Joe O&#x27;Brien (mornings) and Harrison gave WMCA a &quot;one-two punch&quot; for over eight years. Harrison, along with wife Patti, and children Brian Joseph [&quot;B.J.&quot;], Patti, Patrick, and Michael, called the New York suburbs &quot;home&quot;.

In 1965, he recorded the holiday narration &quot;May You Always&quot;, which was released as a single on Amy Records and made the &quot;Billboard&quot; Christmas singles chart that year.

Other WMCA &quot;Good Guys&quot; included Jack Spector, B. Mitchel Reed, Dan Daniel and Johnny Dark, and talk show host Barry Gray. Harrison became popular with his &quot;Housewife Hall of Fame&quot; feature, and participated in the 1966 WMCA Good Guy picnic. Often, he scored the highest ratings on WMCA. Program director Rick Sklar of competing Top 40 station WABC took note.

===WABC–AM, New York (1968–1979)===
In 1968, when WABC morning host Herb Oscar Anderson left the station, Rick Sklar hired Harrison to be the new morning DJ. Harrison was followed on the WABC schedule by Ron Lundy in middays and Dan Ingram in afternoons.

Every year, Harrison played seasonal songs, such as his holiday greeting &quot;May You Always&quot; in December (the Amy records single of this song made the &quot;Billboard&quot; Christmas charts in 1965), and Allan Sherman&#x27;s summer camp novelty, &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh&quot;, throughout the summer months.

WABC personalities included, along with Harrison; Charlie Greer, Scott Muni, Bob Lewis, Ron Lundy, Johnny Donovan, Dan Ingram, Bruce Morrow aka &quot;Cousin Brucie&quot;, Chuck Leonard, Bob Cruz, Frank Kingston Smith, Roby Yonge and Jay Reynolds.

Harrison had a number of &quot;trademark&quot; phrases, such as &quot;Morning, Mom&quot;; &quot;Every brand new day should be unwrapped like a precious gift&quot;; &quot;Stay well, stay happy, stay right here&quot;; and &quot;Harry Harrison wishing you all the very best... because that&#x27;s exactly what you deserve!&quot; Also, on the last day of every year, Harrison would bring his four children to work with him and at the end of his shift, he would join them in giving listeners New Year&#x27;s wishes.

Harrison was let go from WABC as the station changed direction in November 1979.

===WCBS–FM, New York (1980–2003)===
On March 24, 1980, Harrison became the morning personality at WCBS-FM 101.1, playing oldies music. In 1984, with Lundy joining the station, they were once again heard back-to-back. Harrison would interact with Morning Crew engineer Al Vertucci, sportscaster Phil Pepe, and joke about &quot;wacky weather&quot; and toupee warnings with meteorologist Irv &quot;Mr. &quot;G&quot; Gikofsky, and newscasters Mary Jane Royce and Sue Evans. At 7:20 AM, Harrison opened the &quot;birthday book&quot; and announced listener and celebrity birthdays.

On March 19, 2003, after a 44-year career in New York radio, Harrison left WCBS-FM, saying &quot;I am not retiring.&quot; His farewell to his loyal radio friends (from 5:30 to 10:00am) was held before a live audience at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York City. It offered old airchecks plus guest appearances by WCBS-FM colleagues Don K. Reed, Bobby Jay, Steve O&#x27;Brien, Randy Davis and Dan Taylor, his replacement, as well as his son and daughter, Patti. Harrison took phone calls from Bob Shannon, Mike Fitzgerald, Ed Baer, and Ron Lundy. Songs included Gladys Knight&#x27;s &quot;Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)&quot; and the Little River Band&#x27;s &quot;Reminiscing,&quot; before closing with &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For.&quot;

===WCBS–FM, New York (2004–2005)===
Harrison returned to WCBS-FM with a Saturday morning show in 2004. It offered two hours of variety and two hours of Beatles music and memories.

On Memorial Day, May 30, 2005, Harry and &quot;Cousin Brucie&quot; Bruce Morrow were guests on WABC Radio&#x27;s annual &quot;Rewound&quot; show. Four days later, on June 3, WCBS-FM ended its &quot;oldies&quot; format, in favor of the new &quot;Jack&quot; format. However, as a result of listener disapproval, the WCBS-FM Oldies format was brought back on July 12, 2007, in a modernized form.

== Legacy ==

* Harrison was known as New York&#x27;s &quot;Morning Mayor&quot;.
* Mayor Rudy Giuliani declared April 25, 1997, as &quot;Harry Harrison Day,&quot; in honor of the city&#x27;s second &quot;mayor.&quot;
* In November 2019 Harrison was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. Fellow inductees included John Tesh, Ryan Seacrest, and Dr. Ruth Westheimer.

==Death==
Harry Harrison died on January 28, 2020, at his home in Westwood, New Jersey, at the age of 89. He is survived by his daughter Patti and son Patrick; his sons Michael and BJ, and wife Patti predeceased him.

<doc id="244786" wikidata="Q1108866" url="?curid=244786" title="Cornbread">
<text>Cornbread is a quick bread made with cornmeal, associated with the cuisine of the Southern United States, with origins in Native American cuisine. It is an example of batter bread. Dumplings and pancakes made with finely ground cornmeal are staple foods of the Hopi people in Arizona. The Hidatsa people of the Upper Midwest call baked cornbread &quot;naktsi&quot;, while the Choctaw people of the Southeast call it &quot;bvnaha&quot;. The Cherokee and Seneca tribes enrich the basic batter, adding chestnuts, sunflower seeds, apples, or berries, and sometimes combine it with beans or potatoes. Modern versions of cornbread are usually leavened by baking powder.

==History==

Native people in the Americas began using corn (maize) and ground corn as food thousands of years before Europeans arrived in the New World. First domesticated in Mexico around six thousand years ago, corn was introduced to what is now the United States between three thousand and one thousand years ago. Native cooks developed a number of recipes based on corn, including cornbread, that were later adopted by European settlers and enslaved African people—especially those who lived in Southern colonies. 

Although Native people in the Americas first cultivated corn, it was introduced in West Africa by European traders shortly after contact through the Atlantic slave trade, and quickly became a major staple in African cooking. Cornbread dishes like &quot;kush&quot;, for example, in Senegambia and the Sahel represent the transference of cuisine and culture that occurred across the Atlantic Ocean. Cornbread has become a cuisine cornerstone within the southeastern United States as well as being featured on the plates of African Americans, European Americans, and Native people alike.

In its earliest developments in the American colonies, cornbread was a simple combination of ground cornmeal and water that was then stirred together and baked over an open fire or in a hearth. At this point in its history, cornbread&#x27;s role in Southern cuisine emerged out of necessity. Although farmers in the Northeast and Midwest could grow wheat and rye, the heat and humidity of the South made European wheat wither and turn rancid.

== Debate ==
In the 18th-century, the addition of other ingredients, such as buttermilk, eggs, baking soda, baking powder, and pork products (rendered bacon and ham hog fat), greatly changed the texture and flavor of earlier iterations of cornbread, making it much more similar to the version that is eaten today. Although those ingredients were introduced in the 19th-century to improve the texture and taste of cornbread, there are two other common ingredients that were excluded from most recipes until the 20th-century: sugar and wheat flour. As traditional stone mills were replaced with more-efficient steel roller mills in the 20th century, the quality of cornmeal was degraded. The heat from the steel rollers detracted from the corn kernel&#x27;s natural sweetness and flavor and reduced the particle size of the cornmeal produced. As a result, newer cornbread recipes adapted, adding sugar and wheat flour to compensate for the reduced sweetness and structural integrity of the cornmeal. In addition, the introduction of steel roller mills ushered in a new look to cornmeal; the new cornmeal tended to be yellow, whereas the old-fashioned stone ground cornmeal in the coastal South had been traditionally white. Following the proliferation of the more finely-ground yellow cornmeal, debates arose surrounding sweet vs. savory cornbread and white vs. yellow cornmeal—debates which still occur among cornbread eaters and cookers today. The importance of these differences for some cooks and eaters cannot be overstated; in 1950, for example, Francine J. Parr of Houma, Louisiana, posted a desperate headline in the &quot;Times-Picayune&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Got Coarse Grits?,&quot; further explaining, &quot;The only grits we can get is very fine and no better than mush. In short, I&#x27;m advertising for some grocer or other individual selling coarse grits to drop me a line.&quot; Like Parr, some Southerners still prefer the traditional white cornmeal.

==Types of cornbread==
Cornbread is a popular item in Southern cooking and is enjoyed by many people for its texture and aroma. Cornbread can be baked, fried, or (rarely) steamed. Steamed cornbread is mushy, chewier, and more like cornmeal pudding than what most consider to be traditional cornbread. Cornbread can also be baked into corn cakes.

===Baked===

Cornbread is a common bread in United States cuisine, particularly associated with the South and Southwest, as well as being a traditional staple for populations where wheat flour was more expensive. Cornbread, especially leftovers, can be eaten as a breakfast. It is also widely eaten with barbecue and chili con carne. In parts of the Southern and Southwestern United States, cornbread, accompanied by pinto beans, has been a common lunch for many people. It is still a common side dish for many suppers, often served with butter. Cornbread crumbs are also used in some poultry stuffings or dressing as it is called; cornbread stuffing is particularly associated with Thanksgiving turkeys.

In the United States, northern and southern cornbread are different because they generally use different types of corn meal and varying degrees of sugar and eggs. Southern cornbread has traditionally been made with little or no sugar and smaller amounts of flour (or no flour), with northern cornbread being sweeter and more cake-like. Southern cornbread traditionally used white cornmeal and buttermilk. Other ingredients such as pork rinds are sometimes used. Cornbread is occasionally crumbled and served with cold milk or clabber (buttermilk), similar to cold cereal. In Texas, Mexican influence has spawned a hearty cornbread made with fresh or creamed corn kernels and jalapeño peppers and topped with shredded cheese. Cornbread is typically eaten with molasses in the southern states and with butter and honey in the northern states of America.
===Skillet===
Skillet-fried or skillet-baked cornbread (often simplified to cornbread or skillet bread) is a traditional staple in the rural United States, especially in the South. This involves heating bacon drippings, lard or other oil in a heavy, well-seasoned cast-iron skillet in an oven, and then pouring a batter made from cornmeal, egg, and milk directly into the hot grease. The mixture is returned to the oven to bake into a large, crumbly and sometimes very moist cake with a crunchy crust. This bread tends to be dense and is usually served as an accompaniment rather than as a bread served as a regular course. In addition to the skillet method, such cornbread also may be made in sticks, muffins, loaves or baking pans.

A slightly different variety, cooked in a simple baking dish, is associated with northern U.S. cuisine. The batter for northern-style cornbread is very similar to and sometimes interchangeable with that of a corn muffin. A typical contemporary northern U.S. cornbread recipe contains half wheat flour, half cornmeal, milk or buttermilk, eggs, leavening agent, salt, and usually sugar, resulting in a bread that is somewhat lighter and sweeter than the traditional southern version.

Unlike fried variants of cornbread, baked cornbread is a quick bread that is dependent on an egg-based protein matrix for its structure (though the addition of wheat flour adds gluten to increase its cohesiveness). The baking process gelatinizes the starch in the cornmeal, but still often leaves some hard starch to give the finished product a distinctive sandiness not typical of breads made from other grains.

===Crackling bread===

A primarily Southern dish consisting of cornbread with pork cracklings inside. It can be prepared with any method, but a skillet is most common as it allows for making the cornbread crispier.

===Corn pone===
Corn pone (sometimes referred to as &quot;Indian pone&quot;) is a type of cornbread made from a thick, malleable cornmeal dough (which is usually egg-less and milk-less) and cooked in a specific type of iron pan over an open fire (such as a frontiersman would use), using mostly bacon grease, but later, butter, margarine, shortening, or cooking oil. Corn pones are a staple of Southern U.S. cuisine and have been discussed or referenced by many American writers, including Mark Twain.

In the Appalachian Mountains, cornbread baked in a round iron skillet, or in a cake pan of any shape, is still referred to as a &quot;pone&quot; of cornbread (as opposed to &quot;hoe cakes&quot;, the term for cornbread fried pancake style); and when biscuit dough (i.e., &quot;biscuits&quot; in the American sense of the word) is occasionally baked in one large cake rather than as separate biscuits, this is called a &quot;biscuit pone&quot;.

The term &quot;corn pone&quot; is sometimes used derogatorily to refer to one who possesses certain rural, unsophisticated peculiarities (&quot;he&#x27;s a corn pone&quot;), or as an adjective to describe particular rural, folksy or &quot;hick&quot; characteristics (e.g., &quot;corn pone&quot; humor). This pejorative term often is directed at persons from rural areas of the Southern and Midwestern United States. A character in the Li&#x27;l Abner comic strip, General Jubilation T Cornpone, was a mythical Civil War general from Dogpatch known for his retreats and imputed cowardice. President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s staffers, who were mostly Northeastern Ivy League elites, openly mocked Texan Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s rural speech patterns, referring to Johnson behind his back as &quot;Uncle Cornpone&quot; or &quot;Rufus Cornpone&quot;.

===Hot water cornbread===

Cooked on a rangetop, one frying method involves pouring a small amount of liquid batter made with boiling water and self-rising cornmeal (cornmeal with soda or some other chemical leavener added) into a skillet of hot oil and allowing the crust to turn golden and crunchy while the center of the batter cooks into a crumbly, mushy bread. These fried breads are typically in diameter and soft and very rich. Sometimes, to ensure the consistency of the bread, a small amount of wheat flour is added to the batter. This type of cornbread is often known as &quot;hot water&quot; or &quot;scald meal&quot; cornbread and is unique to the American South.

===Johnnycakes===
Pouring a batter similar to that of skillet-fried cornbread, but slightly thinner, into hot grease atop a griddle or a skillet produces a pancake-like bread called a johnnycake. While johnnycake often denotes this pancake-like cornbread, it is also used in a scattered sense as a more general term for cornbread, chiefly in the North.

===Hushpuppies===
A thicker buttermilk-based batter that is deep-fried rather than pan-fried forms the hushpuppy, a common accompaniment to fried fish and other seafood in the South. Hushpuppy recipes vary from state to state, some including onion seasoning, chopped onions, beer, or jalapeños. Fried properly, the hushpuppy will be moist and yellow or white on the inside, while crunchy and light to medium-dark golden brown on the outside. Although Native people ushered corn and cornmeal into African people&#x27;s diets, African cooks are generally credited with introducing the frying of foods in fats. The combination of Native cornmeal and the African technique of frying, therefore, led to the creation of hushpuppies.

=== Fried===

Alongside other iterations of Native cornbread, the Lumbee people in southeastern North Carolina have a unique method of cooking their cornbread. The &quot;fried cornbread&quot; or &quot;frybread&quot; that most Lumbee families serve with meals differs from both hushpuppies and johnnycakes. Prepared with yellow cornmeal, egg, buttermilk, and salt, the cornbread batter is thinly poured into a cast-iron skillet to fry. As Eric Locklear, a member of the Lumbee tribe and owner of Fuller&#x27;s Old-Fashioned BBQ, notes, &quot;It&#x27;s got a crunch around it. I mean, it ain&#x27;t thick; it don&#x27;t look like pancakes. It&#x27;s real thin and crunchy&quot;. After the fried cornbread is made, it is typically served with slices of cheese or collard greens. Glen Hunt, owner of Lumbee Homemade Ice-Cream in North Carolina, states, &quot;You know how the old folks like to eat collards? They like to get a piece of cornbread and dip it in those collards and eat it with their fingers&quot;. In the article, &quot;As We Cooked, We Lived: Lumbee Foodways,&quot; Malinda Maynor Lowery goes on to track the creation of the collard sandwich—a Lumbee special, which features two pieces of fried cornbread with collard greens and fatback meat. Dorsey Hunt, co-owner of Lumbee Homemade Ice-Cream, notes that &quot;[Lumbee people] just started putting [fried cornbread and collards] together and made a sandwich out of it. ...We made the cornmeal fritters, and just put the collards in between it. Put your fatback meat and chow-chow&quot;.

<doc id="244795" wikidata="Q2743758" url="?curid=244795" title="Music of Germany">
<text>Germany claims some of the most renowned composers, singers, producers and performers of the world. Germany is the largest music market in Europe, and third largest in the world.

German classical music is one of the most performed in the world; German composers include some of the most accomplished and popular in history, among them Georg Friedrich Händel, Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, Carl Maria von Weber, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Richard Wagner, Johannes Brahms and Richard Strauss, many of whom were among the composers who created the field of German opera. The most popular living German composer is probably film score composer Hans Zimmer.

German popular music of the 20th and 21st century includes the movements of Neue Deutsche Welle (Nena, Hubert Kah, Alphaville), disco (Boney M., Modern Talking, Dschinghis Khan, Milli Vanilli, Bad Boys Blue), metal/rock (Rammstein, Scorpions, Accept, Helloween), punk (Die Ärzte, Böhse Onkelz, Nina Hagen, Die Toten Hosen), pop rock (Sandra, Enigma, Michael Cretu, Herbert Grönemeyer) and indie (Tocotronic). Famous female singers were Marlene Dietrich and Hildegard Knef. German electronic music gained global influence, with Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream being pioneer groups in this genre. The electro and techno scene is internationally popular, namely due to the DJs Paul van Dyk, Scooter and Cascada. 

Germany hosts many large rock music festivals. The Rock am Ring and Rock im Park festival is among the largest in the world. Since around 1990, the new-old German capital Berlin has developed a diverse music and entertainment industry.

== Minnesingers and Meistersingers (Man and Woman) ==
The beginning of what is now considered German music could be traced back to the 12th-century compositions of mystic abbess Hildegard of Bingen, who wrote a variety of hymns and other kinds of Christian music.

After Latin-language religious music had dominated for centuries, in the 12th century to the 14th centuries, Minnesinger (&quot;love poets&quot;), singing in German, spread across Germany. Minnesinger were aristocrats, traveling from court to court, who had become musicians, and their work left behind a vast body of literature, &quot;Minnelieder&quot;. The following two centuries saw the Minnesinger replaced by middle-class Meistersinger, who were often master craftsmen in their main profession, whose music was much more formalized and rule-based than that of the Minnesinger. Minnesinger and Meistersinger could be considered parallels of French troubadours and trouvère.

Among the Minnesinger, Hermann, a monk from Salzburg, deserves special note. He incorporated folk styles from the Alpine regions in his compositions. He made some primitive forays into polyphony as well. Walther von der Vogelweide and Reinmar von Hagenau are probably the most famous minnesingers from this period.

== Classical music of Germany ==

Germans have played a leading role in the development of classical music. Many of the best classical musicians such as Bach, Händel, Beethoven, Schumann, Brahms, Wagner, Mahler, or Schoenberg (a lineage labeled the &quot;German Stem&quot; by Igor Stravinsky) were German. At the beginning of the 15th century, German classical music was revolutionized by Oswald von Wolkenstein, who travelled across Europe learning about classical traditions, spending time in countries like France and Italy. He brought back some techniques and styles to his homeland, and within a hundred years, Germany had begun producing composers renowned across the continent. Among the first of these composers was the organist Conrad Paumann. The largest summer festival for classical music in Germany is the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival.

=== Chorale ===
Beginning in the 16th century, polyphony, or the intertwining of multiple melodies, arrived in Germany. Protestant chorales predominated; in contrast to Catholic music, chorale was vibrant and energetic. Composers included Dieterich Buxtehude, Heinrich Schütz and Martin Luther, leader of the Protestant Reformation. Luther happened to accompany his sung hymns with a lute, later recreated as the waldzither that became a national instrument of Germany in the 20th century.

=== Opera ===
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; (1791) is usually said to be the beginning of German opera. An earlier starting date for German opera, however, could be Heinrich Schütz&#x27;s &quot;Dafne&quot; from 1627. Schütz is said to be the first great German composer before Johann Sebastian Bach, and was a major figure in 17th-century music.

In the 19th century, two figures were paramount in German opera: Carl Maria von Weber and Richard Wagner. Wagner introduced devices like the Leitmotiv, a musical theme which recurs for important characters or ideas. Wagner (and Weber) based his operas of German history and folklore, most importantly including the &quot;Ring of the Nibelung&quot; (1874). Into the 20th century, opera composers included Richard Strauss (&quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;) and Engelbert Humperdinck, who wrote operas meant for young audiences. Across the border in Austria, Arnold Schoenberg innovated a form of twelve-tone music that used rhythm and dissonance instead of traditional melodies and harmonies, while Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht collaborated on some of the great works of German theater, including &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot; and &quot;The Three-Penny Opera&quot;.

Following the war, German composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen and Hans Werner Henze began experimenting electronic sounds in classical music.

Germany is also very well known for its many subsidised opera houses, such as Semperoper, Munich State Theatre and the Bayreuth Festspielhaus.

=== Baroque period ===
Baroque music, which was the first music to use tonality in the modern sense, is also known for its ornamentation and artistic use of counterpoint. It originated in Northern Italy at the end of the 16th century, and the style migrated quickly to Germany, which was one of the most active centers of early Baroque music. Early German Baroque composers included Heinrich Schütz, Michael Praetorius, Johann Hermann Schein, and Samuel Scheidt. The culmination of the Baroque era was undoubtedly in the works of Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel in the first half of the 18th century. Bach established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and adapted rhythms, forms, and textures from Italy and France. Bach wrote numerous works, including preludes, cantatas, fugues, concertos for harpsichord, violin and wind, orchestral suites, the Brandenburg Concertos, &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, &quot;St John Passion&quot; and the &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot;. Händel was a cosmopolitan composer that wrote music for virtually every genre of his time. His most famous works include the orchestral suites Water Music, Music for the Royal Fireworks and the oratorio Messiah. 
Another important composer was Georg Philipp Telemann, one of the most prolific musicians in history.

=== Classical era ===
By the middle of the 18th century, the cities of Vienna, Dresden, Berlin and Mannheim had become the center for orchestral music. The Esterházy princes of Vienna, for example, were the patrons of Joseph Haydn, an Austrian who invented the classic format of the string quartet, symphony and sonata. Later that century, Vienna&#x27;s Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart emerged, mixing German and Italian traditions into his own style. Mozart was a prolific and influential composer who composed over 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most popular of classical composers, and his influence on subsequent Western art music is profound; Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart.

=== Romantic era ===


The following century saw two major German composers come to fame early—Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert. Beethoven, a student of Haydn&#x27;s in Vienna, used unusually daring harmonies and rhythm and composed numerous pieces for piano, violin, symphonies, chamber music, string quartets and an opera. Schubert created a field of artistic, romantic poetry and music called &quot;lied&quot;; his lieder cycles included &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot; and &quot;Winterreise&quot;.

Franz Schubert was extremely prolific during his lifetime. His output consists of over six hundred secular vocal works (mainly Lieder), seven complete symphonies, sacred music, operas, incidental music and a large body of chamber and piano music. He is ranked among the greatest composers of the late Classical era and early Romantic era.

Early in the 19th century, a composer by the name of Richard Wagner was born. He was a &quot;Musician of the Future&quot; who disliked the strict traditionalist styles of music. He is credited with developing &quot;leitmotivs&quot; which were simple recurring themes found in his operas.

Carl Maria von Weber was a composer, conductor, pianist, guitarist and critic, one of the first significant composers of the Romantic school. His operas &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;, &quot;Euryanthe&quot; and &quot;Oberon&quot; greatly influenced the development of the Romantic opera in Germany. Felix Mendelssohn was a composer, pianist, organist and conductor of the early Romantic period. He was particularly well received in Britain as a composer, conductor and soloist. He wrote symphonies, concerti, oratorios, piano music and chamber music. Robert Schumann was a composer and influential music critic. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era. Schumann&#x27;s published compositions were written exclusively for the piano until 1840; he later composed works for piano and orchestra; many Lieder (songs for voice and piano); four symphonies; an opera; and other orchestral, choral, and chamber works. Johannes Brahms honored the music pioneered by Mozart and Beethoven and advanced his music into a Romantic idiom, in the process creating bold new approaches to harmony and melody.

The later 19th century saw Vienna continue its elevated position in European classical music, as well as a burst of popularity with Viennese waltzes. These were composed by people like Johann Strauss the Younger. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. He is known for his operas, which include &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; and &quot;Salome&quot;; his &quot;lieder&quot;, especially his &quot;Four Last Songs&quot;; and his tone poems. Strauss, along with Gustav Mahler, represents the late flowering of German Romanticism after Richard Wagner, in which pioneering subtleties of orchestration are combined with an advanced harmonic style.

=== 20th century ===

The first half of 20th century saw a split between German and Austrian music. In Vienna, Arnold Schoenberg and his pupils Alban Berg and Anton Webern moved along an increasingly avant-garde path, pioneering atonal music in 1909 and twelve-tone music in 1923. Meanwhile, composers in Berlin took a more populist route, from the cabaret-like socialist operas of Kurt Weill to the Gebrauchsmusik of Paul Hindemith. In Munich there was also Carl Orff, who was influenced by the French Impressionist composer Claude Debussy. He began to use colorful, unusual combinations of instruments in his orchestration. His most popular work is &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;.

Many composers emigrated to the United States when the Nazi Party came to power, including Schoenberg, Hindemith, and Erich Korngold. During this period, the Nazi Party embarked on a campaign to rid Germany of so-called degenerate art, which became a catch-all phrase that included music with any link to Jews, Communists, jazz, and anything else thought to be dangerous. Some figures such as Karl Amadeus Hartmann remained defiantly in Germany during the years of Nazi dominance, continually watchful of how their output might be interpreted by the authorities.

After the defeat of Nazi Germany, musicians were also subjected to the Allied policy of denazification. But here, the supposed non-political nature of music was able to excuse many, including Wilhelm Furtwängler and Herbert von Karajan (who had actually joined the Nazi Party in 1933). They both claimed to have concentrated mainly on music and to have ignored politics, but also to have conducted pieces in ways that were meant to be &quot;gestures of defiance.&quot;

In West Germany in the second half of the 20th century, German and Austrian music was largely dominated by the avant-garde. In the 60s and 70s, the Darmstadt New Music Summer School was a major center of European modernism; German composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen and Hans Werner Henze and non-German ones such as Pierre Boulez and Luciano Berio all studied there. In contrast, composers in East Germany were advised to avoid the avant-garde and to compose music in keeping with the tenets of Socialist Realism. Music written in this style was supposed to advance party politics as well as be more accessible to all. Hanns Eisler and Ernst Hermann Meyer were among the most famous of the first generation of GDR composers.

More recently, composers such as Helmut Lachenmann and Olga Neuwirth have extensively explored the possibilities of extended techniques. Hans Werner Henze largely dissociated himself from the Darmstadt school in favour of a more lyrical approach, and remains perhaps Germany&#x27;s most lauded contemporary composer. Although he had lived outside the country since the 1950s and until his death in 2012, he remained influenced by the Germanic musical tradition.

== Folk music ==

Germany has many unique regions with their own folk traditions of music and dance. Much of the 20th century saw German culture appropriated for the ruling powers (who fought &quot;foreign&quot; music at the same time).

In both East and West Germany, folk songs called &quot;volkslieder&quot; were taught to children; these were popular, sunny and optimistic, and had little relation to authentic German folk traditions. Inspired by American and English roots revivals, Germany underwent many of the same changes following the 1968 student revolution in West Germany, and new songs, featuring political activism and realistic joy, sadness and passion, were written and performed on the burgeoning folk scene. In East Germany, the same process did not begin until the mid-70s, where some folk musicians began incorporating revolutionary ideas in coded songs.

Popular folk songs included emigration songs from the 19th century, work songs and songs of apprentices, as well as democracy-oriented folk songs collected in the 1950s by Wolfgang Steinitz. Beginning in 1970, the &quot;Festival des politischen Liedes&quot;, an East German festival focusing on political songs, was held annually and organized (until 1980) by the FDJ (East German youth association). Musicians from up to thirty countries would participate, and, for many East Germans, it was the only exposure possible to foreign music. Among foreign musicians at the festival, some were quite renowned, including Inti-Illimani (Chile), Billy Bragg (England), Dick Gaughan (Scotland), Mercedes Sosa (Argentina) and Pete Seeger (United States), while German performers included, from both East and West, Oktoberklub, Wacholder and Hannes Wader.

Oom-pah is a kind of music played by the brass bands; it is associated with beer halls.

=== Bavaria and Swabia ===

Bavarian folk music is likely the best known outside of Germany. Yodeling and schuhplattler dancers are among the stereotyped images of German folk life, though these are only found today in the southernmost areas. Bavarian folk music has played a role in the &quot;Alpine New Wave&quot;, and produced several pioneering world music groups that fuse traditional Bavarian sounds with foreign styles.

Around the turn of the 20th century, across Europe and especially in Bavaria, many people became concerned about a loss of cultural traditions. This idea was connected to the &quot;Heimatschutz&quot; movement, which sought to protect regional identities and boundaries. What is considered Bavarian folk music in modern Germany is not the same as what Bavarian folk music was in the early 20th century; like any kind of folk or popular music, styles and traditions have evolved over time, giving birth to new forms of music.

The popularity of the &quot;Volkssänger&quot; (&quot;people&#x27;s singer&quot;) in Bavaria began in the 1880s, and continued in earnest until the 1920s. Shows consisting of duets, ensemble songs, humor and parodies were popular, but the format began changing significantly following World War I. Bally Prell, the &quot;Beauty Queen of Schneizlreuth&quot;, was emblematic of this change. She was an attractive tenor who sang lieder, chanson and opera and operetta.

Swabian folk music is most popularly represented by acts like Saiten Fell and Firlefanz and the singer-songwriter (and player of the hurdy-gurdy and guitar) Thomas Felder.

===Christmas carols===
Some Christmas carols familiar in English are translations of German Christmas songs (&quot;Weihnachtslieder&quot;). Pastoral &quot;Weihnachtslieder&quot; are sometimes called &quot;Hirtenlieder&quot; (shepherd songs). Three well-known examples are &quot;O Tannenbaum&quot; (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot;), from a German folksong arranged by Ernst Anschütz; &quot;Silent Night&quot; (&quot;Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht&quot;), by the Austrians Franz Xaver Gruber and Joseph Mohr; and &quot;Still, still, still&quot;, an Austrian folksong also from the Salzburg region, based on an 1819 melody by Süss, with the original words, slightly changed over time and location, by G. Götsch.

== Early popular music ==

Between World War I and World War II, German music branched out to form new, more liberal and independent styles.

=== Kabarett ===
The first form of German pop music is said to be cabaret, which arose during the Weimar Republic in the 1920s as the sensual music of late-night clubs. Marlene Dietrich and Margo Lion were among the most famous performers of the period, and became associated with both humorous satire and liberal ideas.

=== Swing Movement ===
The strict regimentation of youth culture in Nazi Germany through the Hitler Youth led to the emergence of several underground protest movements, through which adolescents were able better to exert their independence.

One of these consisted mainly of upper middle class youths, who based their protest on their musical preferences, rejecting the völkisch music propagated by the Party in place of American jazz forms, especially Swing. While musical preferences are often a feature of youthful rebellion—as the history of rock and roll shows—jazz and especially Swing were particularly offensive to the Nazi hierarchy: not only did they promote sexual permissiveness, but they were also associated with the American enemy and worse, with the African race they considered inferior. 
On the other hand, Joseph Goebbels assembled some of the now jobless musicians from Germany and conquered countries into a big band called Charlie and His Orchestra.

== Popular music from West Germany ==
After World War II, German pop music was greatly influenced by music from USA and Great Britain. Apart from Schlager and Liedermacher, it is necessary to distinguish between pop music in West Germany and pop music in East Germany which developed in different directions. Pop music from West Germany was often heard in East Germany, had more variety and is still present today, while East German music has had little influence.

In West Germany, English-language pop music became more and more important, and today most songs on the radio are English. Nevertheless, there is great diversity in German language pop music. There is also original English-language pop music from Germany, some having international success (for instance the Scorpions and James Last), but little with enduring broad success in Germany itself. There was very little English pop music from East Germany.

Germany has also had a thriving English-language pop scene since the end of the war, with several European and US acts topping the charts. However, Germans and German-oriented musicians have been successful as well. In the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century such European pop acts were popular as well as artists such as Sarah Connor, No Angels and Monrose who performed various types of mainstream pop in English. Many of these acts have had success all over Europe and Asia.

=== Schlager and Volksmusik ===
Schlager is a kind of vocal pop music, frequently in the form of sentimental ballads sung in German, popularized by singers such as Gitte Hænning and Rex Gildo in the 1960s, though not without a wide range within the style (Modern Schlager, Schlager-Gold, ). Schlager is strictly separated from international pop music and is only played on special format radio stations (sometimes mixed with international Oldies).

An important part of Schlager is &quot;volkstümliche Musik&quot;, a Schlager-like interpretation of traditional German folk themes that is very popular in German-speaking countries, especially among the older generation.

Schlager has a wide variety, and the artists with many other styles, for example: Heino, Katja Ebstein, Wolfgang Petry, Guildo Horn, Roland Kaiser, Helene Fischer and many others.

=== Liedermacher ===
Liedermacher (Songwriter) has sophisticated lyrics and is sung with minimal instrumentation, for instance only with acoustic guitar. Some songs are very political in nature. This is related to American Folk/Americana and French Chanson styles.

Famous West German Liedermacher are Reinhard Mey, Klaus Hoffmann, Hannes Wader and Konstantin Wecker. A famous East German Liedermacher was Wolf Biermann. Herman van Veen from the Netherlands was also very popular in Germany. Several Liedermacher artists also record special albums for children.

=== Rock ===

The US military radio station American Forces Network (AFN) had a great impact on German postwar culture, starting with AFN Munich in July 1945, which was formative for the further development of German rock and jazz culture. Bill Ramsey, a senior producer at AFN Frankfurt in 1953 who came from Ohio, later became famous as a jazz and Schlager singer in Germany (while remaining almost unknown in the US).

Prior to the late 1960s however, rock music in Germany was a negligible part of the schlager genre covered by interpreters such as Peter Kraus and Ted Herold, who played rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll standards by Little Richard or Bill Haley, sometimes translated into German.

Genuine German rock first appeared around 1968, just as the hippie countercultural explosion was peaking in the US and UK. At the time, the German musical avant-garde had been experimenting with electronic music for more than a decade, and the first German rock bands fused psychedelic rock from abroad with electronic sounds. The next few years saw the formation of a group of bands that came to be known as Krautrock or Kosmische Musik groups; these included Amon Düül, who later became the world music pioneers Dissidenten, Tangerine Dream, Popol Vuh, Can, Neu! and Faust.

=== Neue Deutsche Welle ===
Neue Deutsche Welle (NDW) is an outgrowth of British punk rock and new wave which appeared in the mid-to late 1970s. It was arguably the first successful unique German form of Pop music, but was limited in its stylistic devices (funny lyrics and surreal composition and production). Though it was a huge success in Germany itself in the 1980s, this was not long-lasting mostly due to over-commercialization. Some artists became famous internationally like Nena, Trio, Falco (from Austria) and Joachim Witt.

=== Popular artists ===
In the 1980s and 1990s most German-language popular music was sung by male solo artists. Very popular singers are Udo Jürgens, Udo Lindenberg, Herbert Grönemeyer, Marius Müller-Westernhagen, Peter Maffay and BAP.

Udo Jürgens has maintained a large following since the late 60s and still sold out entire soccer stadiums during concerts in 2012. Grönemeyer also has managed to maintain his success up to today. Maffay developed from Schlager to rock and has a large but delimited fan base—he is seldom played on the radio. BAP, who sing in Kölsch, the dialect of their hometown Cologne, enjoy success nationwide.

=== Hamburger Schule ===
Hamburger Schule (School of Hamburg) is an underground music-movement that started in the late 1980s and was still active till around the mid-1990s. It has similar traditions as Neue Deutsche Welle and mixed all that with punk, grunge and experimental pop music. Hamburger Schule includes intellectual lyrics with postmodern theories and social criticism. Important artists are Blumfeld, Die Sterne, Die Goldenen Zitronen and Tocotronic.

== Popular music from East Germany ==

=== &quot;Ostrock&quot; ===
By the early 1970s, experimental West German rock styles had crossed the border into East Germany and influenced the creation of an East German rock movement referred to as &quot;Ostrock&quot;. On the other side of the Iron Curtain, these bands tended to be stylistically more conservative than in the West, to have more reserved engineering, and often to include more classical and traditional structures (such as those developed by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht in their 1920s Berlin theater songs). These groups often featured poetic lyrics loaded with indirect double-meanings and deeply philosophical challenges to the status quo. As such, they were a style of Krautrock. The best-known of these bands were The Puhdys, Karat, City, Stern-Combo Meißen and Silly.

Only a few individual songs, such as &quot;Am Fenster&quot; by City and &quot;Über sieben Brücken mußt Du geh&#x27;n&quot; by Karat, found wide popularity outside the GDR. There was also a wide diversity of underground bands. Out of this scene later grew the internationally successful band Rammstein (see Neue Deutsche Härte below).

== Popular music from reunified Germany ==

=== Modern popular music ===

In the 1990s, German-language groups had only limited popularity, and only a few artists managed to be played on the radio, for example Nena, Herbert Grönemeyer, Marius Müller-Westernhagen, Die Ärzte, Rammstein, Rosenstolz or Die Prinzen.

In the mid-2000s the German band Wir sind Helden found success with a new style of German-language pop-rock. This success was followed by several other bands and artists that led to a new boom of German-language music and a broader acceptance of existing German-language recording artists, such as:

*Sportfreunde Stiller
* Juli
* Silbermond
* Kraftklub
* Klee
* MIA.
*Polarkreis 18
*2raumwohnung
*Revolverheld
* Annett Louisan
*Tim Bendzko
*Andreas Bourani
*Mark Forster
*Philipp Poisel

=== Indie and alternative rock ===
Popular anglophone alternative rock and crossover bands from Germany that managed to find success domestic and abroad include Beatsteaks, Donots, Blackmail, Reamonn, Saline Grace, H-Blockx, Itchy Poopzkid, Guano Apes and Die Happy. The Notwist, an indie rock band, had great critical and commercial success with their album &quot;Neon Golden&quot;.

===Euro disco===
*Boney M.
*Chilly
*Dschinghis Khan
*Mike Mareen
*Fancy
*Silent Circle
*Goombay Dance Band
*London Boys
*Lian Ross
*Arabesque
*Silver Convention
*Penny McLean
*Patty Ryan

=== Synthpop, Eurodance, Pop ===
In the late 1980s (prior to reunification) and the 1990s, Synthpop and Eurodance became popular throughout Germany. Often, different styles were mixed in between these to attract a broad variety of audiences. Successful representatives of these styles were:

* George Kranz
* Culture Beat
* Modern Talking
* Sandra
* Sarah Connor
* Hubert Kah
* The Underdog Project
* Mousse T.
* Milli Vanilli
* Groove Coverage
* Haddaway
* Captain Hollywood Project
* La Bouche
* E-Rotic
* Monrose
* No Angels
* Masterboy
* X-Perience

* Mr. President
* Fun Factory
* Sash!
* Jeanette Biedermann
* Captain Jack
* Lou Bega
* Bad Boys Blue
* Alphaville
* R.I.O.
* Cascada
* Real McCoy
* Snap!
* Camouflage
* A Touch of Class (&quot;British based&quot;)
* Antique (&quot;Greek-Swedish based&quot;)
=== Reggae, dancehall, ska ===
Popular bands and performers include Culcha Candela, Dr. Ring-Ding, Gentleman, Hans Söllner, Jan Delay, Mamadee, Milky Chance, Oceana, Patrice, Peter Fox and Seeed.

=== R&amp;B, soul, funk ===

Notable R&amp;B, Soul and Funk artists include Ayọ, Cassandra Steen, Denyo, Miss Platnum, Nadja Benaissa, Nneka, Söhne Mannheims and Xavier Naidoo.

=== Hip hop ===
Hip hop in Germany arrived in the early 1980s, and graffiti and breakdancing became well-known quickly, even in socialist East Germany. German hip hop &quot;started out as a transnational youth subculture. The commercial success started in 1992 with the hit &quot;Die Da&quot; from Die Fantastischen Vier from Stuttgart. The Rödelheim Hartreim Projekt tried to establish a &quot;gangster&quot; rap. An early influential group was Advanced Chemistry including Torch. They sparked an interest in speaking out for the immigrants and used rap as a way to defend themselves.
 Fettes Brot from Hamburg, has been successful since their beginning. They sing about funny topics, such as infidelity and boasting about their prowess with women. Whereas hip hop had a peak of success in the early first decade of the 21st century, gangster rap became a controversial part of German music and youth culture just as late as 2004 with Aggro Berlin. Some of Germany&#x27;s hip hop artists are: Cro, Kool Savas, Sido, Samy Deluxe, Bushido, Marteria, Eko Fresh, Bonez MC, Gzuz, Samra, Capital Bra, Trettmann, and Afrob. Gzuz gained recognition worldwide after two of his music videos were posted by Worldstar Hip Hop on YouTube.

=== Punk ===
Punk music in Germany has a long and diverse history. When bands like the Sex Pistols and The Clash became popular in West Germany, a number of Punk bands were formed, which led to the creation of a German punk scene. Among the first wave of bands were Male, from Düsseldorf, founded in 1976, PVC, from West Berlin, and Big Balls and the Great White Idiot, from Hamburg. Early German punk groups were heavily influenced by UK bands, often writing their lyrics in English. The main difference is that German punk bands had not yet become political.
Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s there were new movements within the German punk scene, led by labels like ZickZack Records, from Hamburg. It was during this period that the term Neue Deutsche Welle (New German Wave) was first coined by Alfred Hilsberg. Many of these bands played experimental post-punk, often using synthesizers and computers. Among them were The Nina Hagen Band, as well as Fehlfarben and Abwärts, from Hamburg. Both are still active, though they have changed their style several times. Other bands played a more aggressive style of punk rock with a clear leftist political direction influenced by earlier political rock bands like Ton Steine Scherben - bands like Slime, Toxoplasma, or Vorkriegsjugend are still relevant in the German punk scene. There is a still existing scene with many only locally known independent bands that confine themselves from the bigger and more popular groups (that are often branded as &quot;Kommerzpunk&quot;).

Punkrock was outlawed in the GDR. Bands like Schleim-Keim or L&#x27;Attentat were observed and persecuted by the Stasi and could not perform in the public. Music was produced in underground and exchanged on Tape, an attempt to release a split-vinyl of &quot;Schleimkeim&quot; and &quot;Zwitschermaschine&quot; failed since the latter was undercut by government agents.

Nonpolitical punkrock that is also listened to by skinheads is termed as Oi!. Thematically, Oi! songs are often about alcohol, relations, and/or violence. While some Oi! Bands like &quot;Loikaemie&quot; did antifascist songs, there are many cases with an affliction to neonazis, with fluid borders toward right-extremist rockmusic (&quot;Rechtsrock&quot;) within the Oi!-Scene.

There are few German language bands who managed to be successful for a longer period. The best known are the punk bands Die Ärzte and Die Toten Hosen. Both were formed in the early 1980s but have very different approaches to punk. As successful as those two bands in number of sales and number one albums but much lesser accepted by the public and normally not played by German media because of their affiliation with right-wing politics but with a huge fan community were the Oi!-Band Böhse Onkelz. In the mid 2010&#x27;s, Engst was formed with the frontman, Matthias Engst, whose surname was the title for the band.

Digital hardcore band Atari Teenage Riot is particularly well known in the United Kingdom and Japan as well as in German autonomist circles.

=== Heavy metal ===

Germany has a long and strong history with heavy metal. It is considered by many to be one of Europe&#x27;s heaviest contributors to the scene. The genre is quite popular and mainstream within the country. Early hard rock/heavy metal was brought to German soil with the success of Scorpions and Accept. Germany is today known for its large metal festivals including Wacken Open Air and Summer Breeze Open Air.

Germany has a strong tradition of speed metal and power metal. Early speed metal bands include Running Wild, Grave Digger, Rage, and to some extent Warlock and Stormwitch. The European style of power metal, developed in Germany, was popularized by German bands like Blind Guardian, Helloween, Gamma Ray, Freedom Call, Iron Savior, Avantasia, Edguy and Primal Fear gained international recognition. In many cases these bands initially started out playing speed metal, but later switched to power metal. More recently, a new generation of power metal-influenced bands like Masterplan, Orden Ogan, Kissin&#x27; Dynamite and Powerwolf is becoming more and more popular in Germany and abroad.

Running Wild are also considered a pioneer of the pirate metal genre with the release of their 1987 album &quot;Under Jolly Roger,&quot; which was one of the first pirate-themed heavy metal albums.

Three local variants of metal subgenres exist in Germany. The Teutonic thrash metal scene is represented by such groups as Kreator, Sodom, Destruction, Tankard and Exumer. Medieval metal, incorporates German traditional music with industrial metal. Notable bands include Subway to Sally, In Extremo, Corvus Corax, Saltatio Mortis and Schandmaul (the last is considered &quot;folk rock&quot; in Germany). Another variant, Neue Deutsche Härte, a form of industrial metal, is detailed below.

Bands from the genres of death metal, deathcore, metalcore, doom metal, black metal, post-hardcore, and folk metal are: 

*Absurd
*Agathodaimon

Germany has been a major host of the post-hardcore and metalcore scene in which various festivals and tours were in which bands from all over the world played in. Rock am Ring is held at the Nürburgring race track in Nürburg, Rhineland-Palatinate while it&#x27;s counterpart, Rock im Park, is held at the Zeppelinfeld in Nuremberg, Bavaria. Full Force, another huge event, hosts shows between the end of June and at the start of July in Löbnitz, Saxony. In Hamburg, the Elbriot is held annually while over in Cuxhaven, the Deichbrand takes place between July and August. During the summer, the Summer Breeze Open Air festival takes place in Dinkelsbühl, Bavaria. In Wacken, Schleswig-Holstein, the Wacken Open Air festival is held during the first weekend of August. Germany is also the birthplace of the European-wide Impericon Never Say Die! Tour that is held in the Spring all over Europe. Impericon also based their retail store in Leipzig.

====Neue Deutsche Härte====
&quot;Neue Deutsche Härte&quot; (engl. &quot;New German Hardness&quot;) is a term for an extremely popular German variant of Industrial metal. It combines the common sound of metal with elements of gothic and industrial music as well as electronic samples and is mostly sung in German. It is known for morbid and provocative lyrical themes and over-the-top stage shows often featuring fire, pyrotechnic, stunts and other special effects. It draws its audience from both the metal and goth scene. Some bands, especially Rammstein and Oomph! have gained mainstream success and, despite their lyrics being mostly in German, have also found success in non-German-speaking countries. Other famous artists include Stahlhammer (from Austria), Megaherz, Unheilig, Eisbrecher, Tanzwut, and Joachim Witt.

====Medieval metal====
Medieval metal or medieval rock is a subgenre of folk metal that blends hard rock or heavy metal music with medieval folk music. Medieval metal is mostly restricted to Germany where it is known as Mittelalter-Metal or Mittelalter-Rock. The genre emerged from the middle of the 1990s with contributions from Subway to Sally, In Extremo, Schandmaul and Wolgemut. The style is characterised by the prominent use of a wide variety of traditional folk and medieval instruments.

=== Goth ===
Germany is the home of a vivid Goth scene, and has a large scene of musicians from the spectrum who are typically known as &quot;Goth musicians&quot;. Most notable artists are Lacrimosa, Lacrimas Profundere, Xmal Deutschland, Das Ich, Deine Lakaien, Illuminate, Untoten, Erben der Schöpfung (from Liechtenstein), No More, Girls Under Glass or Project Pitchfork. Leipzig is home of the largest event of this subculture worldwide called the Wave-Gotik-Treffen, regularly hosting 25,000 attendants. The WGT is closely followed by the annual M&#x27;era Luna festival in Hildesheim.

Neue Deutsche Todeskunst (engl. &quot;New German Death Art&quot;) is a German death-obsessed Dark Wave style of music that blends Death rock, German Rock, Gothic Rock, and neo-classical music with German philosophical texts and a theatrical stage show. It is restricted to Germany where it emerged in the early 1990s from bands such as Das Ich, Lacrimosa, Relatives Menschsein and Goethes Erben. Many NDT artists are known for their use of Classical Latin.

=== Electronic music and techno ===
Germany has the largest electronic music scene in the world and has a long tradition in and influence on almost all genres of electronic music. The band Kraftwerk was one of the first bands in the world to make music entirely on electronic equipment, and the band Tangerine Dream is often credited as being among the originators and primary influences of the &quot;Berlin School&quot; of electronic music, which would later influence trance music. Some other bands like Liaisons Dangereuses, Tyske Ludder, Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft and Die Krupps created a style later called Electronic body music. Recently a few electronica artists have become successful in the mainstream, such as Monika Kruse, Marusha, Blümchen and MIA. Artists on the cutting edge of German-language techno include Klee. Both Einstürzende Neubauten (collapsing new buildings, translated literally) and KMFDM (no pity for the majority, translated literally) are considered by many industrial and electronic music fans as the godfathers of their genre. Their sounds developed the modern styles of groups such as NIN, Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, and New Order. Einstürzende Neubauten can be recognized by their Prince-esque logo, which has been subliminally fused into several mainstream American movies (such as a tattoo in the movie Bug, directed by William Friedkin, starring Harry Connick Jr.). KMFDM has released many songs in English, making them more accessible to their huge American and worldwide audience.

In the 1990s, Germany was one of the most successful contributors to the Eurodance genre, with notable German-based acts including Real McCoy, Snap!, Culture Beat, La Bouche, Captain Jack, Captain Hollywood Project, Fun Factory, Masterboy and Haddaway.

Since 2006 producer and DJ Paul Kalkbrenner gained popularity in Germany. He nowadays is one of the most famous performers of electronic music.

Trance music is a style of electronic music that originated in Germany in the very late 1980s and early 1990s, upon German unification. Following the development of trance music in Germany, many Trance genres stemmed from the original trance music and most trance genres developed in Germany, most notably &quot;Anthem trance&quot; or also called &quot;uplifting&quot; or &quot;epic&quot; trance, progressive trance, and &quot;Ambient trance&quot;.

One of the most notable event referring to this scene was the Love Parade festival with up to 1.5 million participants from all over the world.

Scooter are by far the most successful German dance act, having found huge national and international success.

In recent years, German DJs have found worldwide success in the popular edm genre, most notably Paul Kalkbrenner, Cascada, Felix Jaehn and Robin Schulz.

Other popular and influential German DJs and dance projects include Paul van Dyk, WestBam, DJ Quicksilver, ATB, Ian Pooley, Jam &amp; Spoon, Lexy &amp; K-Paul, Blank &amp; Jones, Sven Väth, Dune, ItaloBrothers, Groove Coverage, Novaspace, International Pony and Anthony Rother.

=== Klezmer in Germany and Eastern Europe ===
Klezmer is a musical Jewish genre that consists of mainly instrumental songs. In Germany, Klezmer expanded significantly after the fall of the Berlin Wall in the mid-1980s. As Klezmer was expanding, so was the Yiddish folk movement, and the two genres became intertwined to a certain extent. In the 1980s while Klezmer was seeing tremendous growth, many Jews in Eastern Europe turned to Klezmer as a means of understanding their communist backgrounds and showing their remembrance to those who experienced the Holocaust. Once Klezmer groups started to tour outside of Europe in the 1980s, Americans gained immediate interest in the music genre. Henry Sapoznik created the first American Klezmer band, known as Kapelye, which toured all around Europe. The spread of Americans playing Klezmer brought a new tone to the genre which captured large audiences. Most American groups who played Klezmer added a hint of American rock into their performances, which was different from the traditional sound of Klezmer in Eastern Europe. It was uncomfortable at first for many of the American Klezmer bands to play in Germany because of the trauma that had occurred there. Despite Germany&#x27;s background, the American Klezmer groups knew Germany was a place they had to play because of Klezmer&#x27;s popularity there. Over time, Klezmer&#x27;s audience expanded in Germany and the American Klezmer bands were able to adjust.

Giora Feidman is arguably one of the most influential Klezmer musicians. Feidman created a new perspective for Klezmer, and shared a new ideology for how the music genre could be viewed and appreciated. Feidman gained a large amount of popularity from his work on the musical play, &quot;Ghetto&quot;, which associated him and his style with the Holocaust. He brought a new theme to Klezmer music which focused on the remembrance of the Holocaust, and a way of &quot;healing&quot; the trauma caused by the Holocaust. Feidman turned Klezmer into a form of personal expression, in which he tried to unite all people (especially the Jews and Germans) and all things through Klezmer. He completely shifted the ideology of Klezmer and explained how Klezmer is in everything, it is even a way to get in touch with religion and communicate with God. However, some people believe Feidman took his ideology too far and turned Klezmer into something that it never intended to become.

During the 1980s Klezmer underwent significant transformation, and by the middle-late 1990s Klezmer experienced a new wave of change. Klezmer became a name for many different trends far from where it originated. Klezmer was known as a political statement, a method of healing, amateur musicians getting together and playing music, a way to reconnect with lost traditions.

<text>Wesley Reid Scantlin (born June 9, 1972) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. He is best known as the lead vocalist, guitarist, and only constant member of rock band Puddle of Mudd. He was named one of the &quot;Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists&quot; by &quot;Hit Parader&quot;.

==Career==
Scantlin formed Puddle of Mudd in 1991. They released their debut EP &quot;Stuck&quot; in 1994, followed by a demo album called &quot;Abrasive&quot; in 1997. Four years later, the band added three new members and released their debut album &quot;Come Clean&quot;. In 2003, they released their second album, &quot;Life on Display&quot;. Their third album, &quot;Famous&quot;, was released in 2007, followed by &quot;Songs in the Key of Love &amp; Hate&quot; in 2009 and &quot;Welcome to Galvania&quot; in 2019.

Scantlin sometimes tours with Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell, joining Cantrell in playing acoustic renditions of Alice in Chains songs. He was also one of the musicians who participated in Alice in Chains&#x27; reunion tsunami benefit show, and was one of many artists who worked with Carlos Santana on his album &quot;All That I Am&quot; for the song &quot;Just Feel Better&quot;. The song was recorded twice with both Scantlin and Steven Tyler, but only Tyler&#x27;s version appears on the album.

==Personal life==
Scantlin attended Park Hill High School in Kansas City. He has a son born in 1997, from a previous relationship. He married Jessica Nicole Smith in January 2008. They divorced in May 2012.

During an October 2017 show in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, Scantlin apologized to the audience for his on-and-offstage behaviour in previous years and admitted to struggling with addiction. He then announced his sobriety and began playing the song &quot;Uh Oh&quot;, which he had previously written to address his problems.

==Legal issues and controversies==
In March 2002, Scantlin and his then-fiancée, actress Michelle Rubin, were both arrested for allegations of domestic violence after witnesses reported seeing the couple fighting on the side of California&#x27;s Highway 126 while on their way to a video shoot. Several witnesses reported seeing Scantlin forcing Rubin into a Jeep Cherokee driven by an unknown third person. Scantlin and Rubin were released after posting $20,000 bail each.

During a February 22, 2004 show in Toledo, Ohio, Scantlin admitted to the audience that he was too intoxicated to continue after only four songs. Frustrated, his bandmates walked off the stage.

On September 24, 2007, Scantlin was banned from Graceland after entering an off-limits swimming pool.

On December 11, 2011, Scantlin was pursued by the IRS for non-payment of back taxes in the region of $60,000.

On April 4, 2012, Scantlin was arrested for cocaine possession, driving under the influence, and driving without a license in Culver City, California. He agreed to attend rehab to erase his potential five-year jail sentence. On September 4, he was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct on a cross-country flight from Boston to Los Angeles. The plane had to make an emergency landing in Austin, Texas, where Scantlin was charged with public intoxication.

In May 2013, Scantlin was arrested on domestic violence charges after he allegedly dragged ex-wife Jessica Nicole Smith and pulled her by the arm or shirt. In July, he was arrested on charges of felony vandalism after he used a buzzsaw to destroy property on his neighbor&#x27;s patio.

On January 4, 2014, Scantlin was sued by American Express for non-payment of debt. During a show at Trees Dallas on April 16, he threw a microphone and beer into the audience, as well as appearing to threaten and attempt to physically attack members of the audience. He also received criticism as he appeared to be lip-syncing during the performance.

On January 16, 2015, Scantlin was arrested at Denver International Airport after taking a joyride on a baggage carousel and entering a restricted area. During a show on April 2, he smashed his guitar, headphones, and part of the drumkit before walking out. On April 15, he was arrested and charged for disorderly conduct at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. On July 26, he was arrested in the early morning after leading sheriff deputies on a high-speed chase in excess of 100 mph through Renville County, Minnesota. He faced a felony charge of fleeing a police officer in a motor vehicle and two gross misdemeanors of driving under the influence, but the charges were dropped. On August 5, he was arrested for driving under the influence in Sturgis, South Dakota.

On January 10, 2016, Scantlin tried to re-enter the house he had lost via foreclosure the previous year, and was arrested for destroying property inside the residence. On April 2, he was arrested at his Los Angeles home. In February, during a concert in Northampton, Pennsylvania, Scantlin berated the sound manager and threatened to call the &quot;Kansas City Mafia&quot; on him before ending the show early. On April 30, Scantlin was arrested for missing a court date. On August 16, he was caught drinking just before a flight to Louisville, Kentucky. He was removed from the flight and had to cancel a scheduled performance in Louisville. On August 23, Scantlin&#x27;s neighbors called police after witnessing him rigging a fake bomb onto his vehicles in an attempt to deter thieves. The mock explosive, consisting of wires attached to the car motor and a gas tank, caused the bomb squad to be called and four surrounding buildings to be evacuated.

On September 9, 2017, Scantlin was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport after he tried to board a plane with a BB gun. His bail was set at $850,000.

On February 20, 2023, Scantlin was arrested for misdemeanor trespassing after again showing up to his former Hollywood home that he lost years earlier due to foreclosure. According to the present homeowner, he refused to leave when asked and threatened her maid, prompting the homeowner to call the police. He was initially held on $1,000 bond, but was later released on personal recognizance.

On August 3, 2024, Scantlin was arrested in Burbank, California after being pulled over in his black Hummer H2 for a traffic violation. Officers said they found out Scantlin had an active warrant from a previous case for allegedly having a weapon at an airport. Officers asked Scantlin to get out of the car, he refused and after several attempts, a crisis negotiator came to negotiate, but cops say he still wouldn’t budge, spray and pepper balls were then deployed. Scantlin was then booked at the jail for the outstanding warrant and the new charge of resisting arrest.

<text>Grise Fiord (; ) is an Inuit hamlet on the southern tip of Ellesmere Island, in the Qikiqtaaluk Region, Nunavut, Canada. It is one of three populated places on the island; despite its low population (144 residents at the 2021 Canadian census), it is the largest community (and only public community) on Ellesmere Island. Created by the Canadian Government in 1953 through a relocation of Inuit families from Inukjuak, Quebec, it is Canada&#x27;s northernmost public community. It is also one of the coldest inhabited places in the world, with an average yearly temperature of .

==History==
===Creation===
This community (and that of Resolute) was created by the Canadian government in 1953, partly to assert sovereignty in the High Arctic during the Cold War. Eight Inuit families from Inukjuak, Quebec (on the Ungava Peninsula), were relocated after being promised homes and game to hunt, but the relocated people discovered no buildings and very little familiar wildlife. They were told that they would be returned home after a year if they wished, but this offer was later withdrawn, for it would have damaged Canada&#x27;s claims to sovereignty in the area; the Inuit were forced to stay. Eventually, the Inuit learned the local beluga whale migration routes and were able to survive in the area, hunting over a range of each year.

In 1993, the Canadian government held hearings to investigate the relocation program. The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples issued a report entitled &quot;The High Arctic Relocation: A Report on the 1953–55 Relocation&quot;, recommending a settlement. The government paid CAD10 million to the survivors and their families, and gave a formal apology in 2010.

In 2009, artist and Grise Fiord resident Looty Pijamini was commissioned by Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated to build a monument to commemorate the Inuit who sacrificed so much as a result of the Government&#x27;s forced relocation programme of 1953 and 1955. Pijamini&#x27;s monument, located in Grise Fiord, depicts a woman with a young boy and a husky, with the woman sombrely looking out towards Resolute Bay. Amagoalik&#x27;s monument, located in Resolute, depicts a lone man looking towards Grise Fiord. This was meant to show separated families, and depicting them longing to see each other again. The Grise Fiord monument was unveiled by John Duncan, at the time, Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development and Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians, on September 10, 2010.

Grise Fiord was the location for a 1995 BBC television documentary entitled &quot;Billy Connolly: A Scot in the Arctic&quot;, in which the comedian Billy Connolly camped alone for a week on the pack ice near to the community, armed with a rifle to protect him from polar bears.

== Geography ==

Located at the southern tip of Ellesmere Island, Grise Fiord is one of three permanent inhabited places on the island. Farther north on the island, Environment Canada has a permanent weather station at Eureka, and at Alert there is a permanent Canadian Forces Base (CFS Alert) and weather station. Grise Fiord lies north of the Arctic Circle, and is the northernmost civilian community in Canada.

Grise Fiord is cradled by the Arctic Cordillera mountain range.

===Climate===
Grise Fiord has a tundra climate (Köppen: &quot;ETf&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Ftkd&quot;) with very short, cool summers and long, cold winters lasting almost the entire year.


== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Grise Fiord had a population of 144 living in 58 of its 64 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 129. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Community and fiord names==
Just to the north of the community is the actual fiord, Grise Fiord, which means &quot;pig inlet&quot; in Norwegian. Otto Sverdrup from Norway so named it during an expedition around 1900 because he thought walruses in the area sounded like pigs.

The Inuktitut name is (&quot;&quot;), which means &quot;place that never thaws&quot;.

==Living conditions==

The houses are wooden and built on platforms to cope with the freezing and thawing of the permafrost. Hunting is still an important part of the lifestyle of the mostly Inuit population. Quota systems allow the villagers to supply many of their needs from populations of seals, walruses, narwhal and beluga whales, polar bears and muskox. Ecotourism is developing as people come to see the northern wildlife found on Ellesmere and surrounding islands.

===Transportation===
There are no connecting roads on Ellesmere Island, so Grise Fiord is connected to the rest of the world by a small airstrip (Grise Fiord Airport), in length. Surrounded by mountains, it has one of the most difficult approaches for aircraft; it is cautioned that only very experienced pilots of Pilatus PC-12, DHC-6 Twin Otter and DHC-7 aircraft attempt the approach.

For local travel needs, the villagers use all-terrain vehicles in the summer and snowmobiles in the winter. During the winter months travel is limited to the town site and a small patch of land to the east, called Nuvuk, due to mountains and ice fields that cut off the town from the rest of the island. Small boats are used in summer to reach hunting grounds, and to hunt sea mammals on the ocean. Once a year large ships (sealift) arrive with supplies and fuel.

===Economy, development, and sustainability===
The local cooperative is the main place to purchase supplies. There are local guide and outfitting operations, which are an important source of income for many families, as are carving, traditional clothing and other Inuit crafts. Due to the extreme location, the economy is subsistence-based. Because of the potential for avalanches and falling rocks from mountains, there is no room for expansion.

===Communications===

In 1970, Bell Canada established what was then the world&#x27;s most northerly telephone exchange (operated since 1992 by Northwestel). It is in the 867 area code (formerly 819 before October 1997) with its only exchange code of 980.

Since 2005, the community has been served by the Qiniq network, a fixed wireless service to homes and businesses that connects to the outside world via a satellite backbone. In 2017 the network, designed and operated by SSI Micro, was upgraded to 4G LTE technology, and 2G-GSM for mobile voice. In 2019, Bell Mobility became available to Grise Fiord.

===Crime and safety===
A Simon Fraser University study of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) activity in the Baffin Region states that Grise Fiord had the lowest rate of criminal offences of all communities examined in 1992, and cites a 1994 Statistics Canada survey indicating that the hamlet has the highest perception of personal safety.
