<text>Algebraic varieties are the central objects of study in algebraic geometry, a sub-field of mathematics. Classically, an algebraic variety is defined as the set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations over the real or complex numbers. Modern definitions generalize this concept in several different ways, while attempting to preserve the geometric intuition behind the original definition. 

Conventions regarding the definition of an algebraic variety differ slightly. For example, some definitions require an algebraic variety to be irreducible, which means that it is not the union of two smaller sets that are closed in the Zariski topology. Under this definition, non-irreducible algebraic varieties are called algebraic sets. Other conventions do not require irreducibility.

The fundamental theorem of algebra establishes a link between algebra and geometry by showing that a monic polynomial (an algebraic object) in one variable with complex number coefficients is determined by the set of its roots (a geometric object) in the complex plane. Generalizing this result, Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz provides a fundamental correspondence between ideals of polynomial rings and algebraic sets. Using the &quot;Nullstellensatz&quot; and related results, mathematicians have established a strong correspondence between questions on algebraic sets and questions of ring theory. This correspondence is a defining feature of algebraic geometry.

Many algebraic varieties are differentiable manifolds, but an algebraic variety may have singular points while a differentiable manifold cannot. Algebraic varieties can be characterized by their dimension. Algebraic varieties of dimension one are called algebraic curves and algebraic varieties of dimension two are called algebraic surfaces.

In the context of modern scheme theory, an algebraic variety over a field is an integral (irreducible and reduced) scheme over that field whose structure morphism is separated and of finite type.

==Overview and definitions==
An &quot;affine variety&quot; over an algebraically closed field is conceptually the easiest type of variety to define, which will be done in this section. Next, one can define projective and quasi-projective varieties in a similar way. The most general definition of a variety is obtained by patching together smaller quasi-projective varieties. It is not obvious that one can construct genuinely new examples of varieties in this way, but Nagata gave an example of such a new variety in the 1950s.

===Affine varieties===

For an algebraically closed field and a natural number , let be an affine -space over , identified to formula_1 through the choice of an affine coordinate system. The polynomials in the ring can be viewed as &quot;K&quot;-valued functions on by evaluating at the points in , i.e. by choosing values in &quot;K&quot; for each &quot;xi&quot;. For each set &quot;S&quot; of polynomials in , define the zero-locus &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) to be the set of points in on which the functions in &quot;S&quot; simultaneously vanish, that is to say

:formula_2

A subset &quot;V&quot; of is called an affine algebraic set if &quot;V&quot; = &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) for some &quot;S&quot;. A nonempty affine algebraic set &quot;V&quot; is called irreducible if it cannot be written as the union of two proper algebraic subsets. An irreducible affine algebraic set is also called an affine variety. (Some authors use the phrase &quot;affine variety&quot; to refer to any affine algebraic set, irreducible or not.)

Affine varieties can be given a natural topology by declaring the closed sets to be precisely the affine algebraic sets. This topology is called the Zariski topology.

Given a subset &quot;V&quot; of , we define &quot;I&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) to be the ideal of all polynomial functions vanishing on &quot;V&quot;:

:formula_3

For any affine algebraic set &quot;V&quot;, the coordinate ring or structure ring of &quot;V&quot; is the quotient of the polynomial ring by this ideal.

===Projective varieties and quasi-projective varieties===
Let be an algebraically closed field and let be the projective &quot;n&quot;-space over . Let in be a homogeneous polynomial of degree &quot;d&quot;. It is not well-defined to evaluate on points in in homogeneous coordinates. However, because is homogeneous, meaning that , it &quot;does&quot; make sense to ask whether vanishes at a point . For each set &quot;S&quot; of homogeneous polynomials, define the zero-locus of &quot;S&quot; to be the set of points in on which the functions in &quot;S&quot; vanish:

:formula_4

A subset &quot;V&quot; of is called a projective algebraic set if &quot;V&quot; = &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) for some &quot;S&quot;. An irreducible projective algebraic set is called a projective variety.

Projective varieties are also equipped with the Zariski topology by declaring all algebraic sets to be closed.

Given a subset &quot;V&quot; of , let &quot;I&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) be the ideal generated by all homogeneous polynomials vanishing on &quot;V&quot;. For any projective algebraic set &quot;V&quot;, the coordinate ring of &quot;V&quot; is the quotient of the polynomial ring by this ideal.

A quasi-projective variety is a Zariski open subset of a projective variety. Notice that every affine variety is quasi-projective. Notice also that the complement of an algebraic set in an affine variety is a quasi-projective variety; in the context of affine varieties, such a quasi-projective variety is usually not called a variety but a constructible set.

===Abstract varieties===
In classical algebraic geometry, all varieties were by definition quasi-projective varieties, meaning that they were open subvarieties of closed subvarieties of a projective space. For example, in Chapter 1 of Hartshorne a &quot;variety&quot; over an algebraically closed field is defined to be a quasi-projective variety, but from Chapter 2 onwards, the term variety (also called an abstract variety) refers to a more general object, which locally is a quasi-projective variety, but when viewed as a whole is not necessarily quasi-projective; i.e. it might not have an embedding into projective space. So classically the definition of an algebraic variety required an embedding into projective space, and this embedding was used to define the topology on the variety and the regular functions on the variety. The disadvantage of such a definition is that not all varieties come with natural embeddings into projective space. For example, under this definition, the product is not a variety until it is embedded into a larger projective space; this is usually done by the Segre embedding. Furthermore, any variety that admits one embedding into projective space admits many others, for example by composing the embedding with the Veronese embedding; thus many notions that should be intrinsic, such as that of a regular function, are not obviously so.

The earliest successful attempt to define an algebraic variety abstractly, without an embedding, was made by André Weil. In his &quot;Foundations of Algebraic Geometry,&quot; using valuations. Claude Chevalley made a definition of a scheme, which served a similar purpose, but was more general. However, Alexander Grothendieck&#x27;s definition of a scheme is more general still and has received the most widespread acceptance. In Grothendieck&#x27;s language, an abstract algebraic variety is usually defined to be an integral, separated scheme of finite type over an algebraically closed field, although some authors drop the irreducibility or the reducedness or the separateness condition or allow the underlying field to be not algebraically closed. Classical algebraic varieties are the quasiprojective integral separated finite type schemes over an algebraically closed field.

====Existence of non-quasiprojective abstract algebraic varieties====
One of the earliest examples of a non-quasiprojective algebraic variety were given by Nagata. Nagata&#x27;s example was not complete (the analog of compactness), but soon afterwards he found an algebraic surface that was complete and non-projective. Since then other examples have been found: for example, it is straightforward to construct toric varieties that are not quasi-projective but complete.

==Examples==

===Subvariety===
A subvariety is a subset of a variety that is itself a variety (with respect to the topological structure induced by the ambient variety). For example, every open subset of a variety is a variety. See also closed immersion.

Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz says that closed subvarieties of an affine or projective variety are in one-to-one correspondence with the prime ideals or non-irrelevant homogeneous prime ideals of the coordinate ring of the variety.

===Affine variety===

====Example 1====
Let , and A2 be the two-dimensional affine space over C. Polynomials in the ring C[&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;] can be viewed as complex valued functions on A2 by evaluating at the points in A2. Let subset &quot;S&quot; of C[&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;] contain a single element :

:formula_5

The zero-locus of is the set of points in A2 on which this function vanishes: it is the set of all pairs of complex numbers (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) such that &quot;y&quot; = 1 − &quot;x&quot;. This is called a line in the affine plane. (In the classical topology coming from the topology on the complex numbers, a complex line is a real manifold of dimension two.) This is the set :

:formula_6

Thus the subset of A2 is an algebraic set. The set &quot;V&quot; is not empty. It is irreducible, as it cannot be written as the union of two proper algebraic subsets. Thus it is an affine algebraic variety.

====Example 2====
Let , and A2 be the two-dimensional affine space over C. Polynomials in the ring C[&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;] can be viewed as complex valued functions on A2 by evaluating at the points in A2. Let subset &quot;S&quot; of C[&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;] contain a single element &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;):

:formula_7

The zero-locus of &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is the set of points in A2 on which this function vanishes, that is the set of points (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) such that &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2 = 1. As &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is an absolutely irreducible polynomial, this is an algebraic variety. The set of its real points (that is the points for which &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are real numbers), is known as the unit circle; this name is also often given to the whole variety.

====Example 3====
The following example is neither a hypersurface, nor a linear space, nor a single point. Let A3 be the three-dimensional affine space over C. The set of points (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;2, &quot;x&quot;3) for &quot;x&quot; in C is an algebraic variety, and more precisely an algebraic curve that is not contained in any plane. It is the twisted cubic shown in the above figure. It may be defined by the equations
:formula_8
The irreducibility of this algebraic set needs a proof. One approach in this case is to check that the projection (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) → (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is injective on the set of the solutions and that its image is an irreducible plane curve.

For more difficult examples, a similar proof may always be given, but may imply a difficult computation: first a Gröbner basis computation to compute the dimension, followed by a random linear change of variables (not always needed); then a Gröbner basis computation for another monomial ordering to compute the projection and to prove that it is generically injective and that its image is a hypersurface, and finally a polynomial factorization to prove the irreducibility of the image.

==== General linear group ====
The set of &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrices over the base field &quot;k&quot; can be identified with the affine &quot;n&quot;2-space formula_9 with coordinates formula_10 such that formula_11 is the (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;)-th entry of the matrix formula_12. The determinant formula_13 is then a polynomial in formula_10 and thus defines the hypersurface formula_15 in formula_9. The complement of formula_17 is then an open subset of formula_9 that consists of all the invertible &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrices, the general linear group formula_19. It is an affine variety, since, in general, the complement of a hypersurface in an affine variety is affine. Explicitly, consider formula_20 where the affine line is given coordinate &quot;t&quot;. Then formula_19 amounts to the zero-locus in formula_20 of the polynomial in formula_23:
:formula_24
i.e., the set of matrices &quot;A&quot; such that formula_25 has a solution. This is best seen algebraically: the coordinate ring of formula_19 is the localization formula_27, which can be identified with formula_28.

The multiplicative group k* of the base field &quot;k&quot; is the same as formula_29 and thus is an affine variety. A finite product of it formula_30 is an algebraic torus, which is again an affine variety.

A general linear group is an example of a linear algebraic group, an affine variety that has a structure of a group in such a way the group operations are morphism of varieties.

==== Characteristic variety ====

Let &quot;A&quot; be a not-necessarily-commutative algebra over a field &quot;k&quot;. Even if &quot;A&quot; is not commutative, it can still happen that &quot;A&quot; has a formula_31-filtration so that the associated ring formula_32 is commutative, reduced and finitely generated as a &quot;k&quot;-algebra; i.e., formula_33 is the coordinate ring of an affine (reducible) variety &quot;X&quot;. For example, if &quot;A&quot; is the universal enveloping algebra of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra formula_34, then formula_33 is a polynomial ring (the PBW theorem); more precisely, the coordinate ring of the dual vector space formula_36.

Let &quot;M&quot; be a filtered module over &quot;A&quot; (i.e., formula_37). If formula_38 is fintiely generated as a formula_33-algebra, then the support of formula_38 in &quot;X&quot;; i.e., the locus where formula_38 does not vanish is called the characteristic variety of &quot;M&quot;. The notion plays an important role in the theory of &quot;D&quot;-modules.

=== Projective variety ===
A projective variety is a closed subvariety of a projective space. That is, it is the zero locus of a set of homogeneous polynomials that generate a prime ideal.

==== Example 1 ====
A plane projective curve is the zero locus of an irreducible homogeneous polynomial in three indeterminates. The projective line P1 is an example of a projective curve; it can be viewed as the curve in the projective plane } defined by . For another example, first consider the affine cubic curve

:formula_42

in the 2-dimensional affine space (over a field of characteristic not two). It has the associated cubic homogeneous polynomial equation:

:formula_43

which defines a curve in P2 called an elliptic curve. The curve has genus one (genus formula); in particular, it is not isomorphic to the projective line P1, which has genus zero. Using genus to distinguish curves is very basic: in fact, the genus is the first invariant one uses to classify curves (see also the construction of moduli of algebraic curves).

==== Example 2: Grassmannian ====
Let &quot;V&quot; be a finite-dimensional vector space. The Grassmannian variety &quot;Gn&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) is the set of all &quot;n&quot;-dimensional subspaces of &quot;V&quot;. It is a projective variety: it is embedded into a projective space via the Plücker embedding:

:formula_44

where &quot;bi&quot; are any set of linearly independent vectors in &quot;V&quot;, formula_45 is the &quot;n&quot;-th exterior power of &quot;V&quot;, and the bracket [&quot;w&quot;] means the line spanned by the nonzero vector &quot;w&quot;.

The Grassmannian variety comes with a natural vector bundle (or locally free sheaf in other terminology) called the tautological bundle, which is important in the study of characteristic classes such as Chern classes.

==== Jacobian variety and abelian variety ====
Let &quot;C&quot; be a smooth complete curve and formula_46 the Picard group of it; i.e., the group of isomorphism classes of line bundles on &quot;C&quot;. Since &quot;C&quot; is smooth, formula_46 can be identified as the divisor class group of &quot;C&quot; and thus there is the degree homomorphism formula_48. The Jacobian variety formula_49 of &quot;C&quot; is the kernel of this degree map; i.e., the group of the divisor classes on &quot;C&quot; of degree zero. A Jacobian variety is an example of an abelian variety, a complete variety with a compatible abelian group structure on it (the name &quot;abelian&quot; is however not because it is an abelian group). An abelian variety turns out to be projective (in short, algebraic theta functions give an embedding into a projective space. See equations defining abelian varieties); thus, formula_49 is a projective variety. The tangent space to formula_49 at the identity element is naturally isomorphic to formula_52 hence, the dimension of formula_49 is the genus of formula_54.

Fix a point formula_55 on formula_54. For each integer formula_57, there is a natural morphism
:formula_58
where formula_59 is the product of &quot;n&quot; copies of &quot;C&quot;. For formula_60 (i.e., &quot;C&quot; is an elliptic curve), the above morphism for formula_61 turns out to be an isomorphism; in particular, an elliptic curve is an abelian variety.

==== Moduli varieties ====
Given an integer formula_62, the set of isomorphism classes of smooth complete curves of genus formula_63 is called the moduli of curves of genus formula_63 and is denoted as formula_65. There are few ways to show this moduli has a structure of a possibly reducible algebraic variety; for example, one way is to use geometric invariant theory which ensures a set of isomorphism classes has a (reducible) quasi-projective variety structure. Moduli such as the moduli of curves of fixed genus is typically not a projective variety; roughly the reason is that a degeneration (limit) of a smooth curve tends to be non-smooth or reducible. This leads to the notion of a stable curve of genus formula_66, a not-necessarily-smooth complete curve with no terribly bad singularities and not-so-large automorphism group. The moduli of stable curves formula_67, the set of isomorphism classes of stable curves of genus formula_66, is then a projective variety which contains formula_65 as an open dense subset. Since formula_67 is obtained by adding boundary points to formula_65, formula_67 is colloquially said to be a compactification of formula_65. Historically a paper of Mumford and Deligne introduced the notion of a stable curve to show formula_65 is irreducible when formula_66.

The moduli of curves exemplifies a typical situation: a moduli of nice objects tend not to be projective but only quasi-projective. Another case is a moduli of vector bundles on a curve. Here, there are the notions of stable and semistable vector bundles on a smooth complete curve formula_54. The moduli of semistable vector bundles of a given rank formula_77 and a given degree formula_78 (degree of the determinant of the bundle) is then a projective variety denoted as formula_79, which contains the set formula_80 of isomorphism classes of stable vector bundles of rank formula_77 and degree formula_78 as an open subset. Since a line bundle is stable, such a moduli is a generalization of the Jacobian variety of formula_54.

In general, in contrast to the case of moduli of curves, a compactification of a moduli need not be unique and, in some cases, different non-equivalent compactifications are constructed using different methods and by different authors. An example over formula_84 is the problem of compactifying formula_85, the quotient of a bounded symmetric domain formula_86 by an action of an arithmetic discrete group formula_87. A basic example of formula_85 is when formula_89, Siegel&#x27;s upper half-space and formula_87 commensurable with formula_91; in that case, formula_85 has an interpretation as the moduli formula_93 of principally polarized complex abelian varieties of dimension formula_63 (a principal polarization identifies an abelian variety with its dual). The theory of toric varieties (or torus embeddings) gives a way to compactify formula_85, a toroidal compactification of it. But there are other ways to compactify formula_85; for example, there is the minimal compactification of formula_85 due to Baily and Borel: it is the projective variety associated to the graded ring formed by modular forms (in the Siegel case, Siegel modular forms; see also Siegel modular variety). The non-uniqueness of compactifications is due to the lack of moduli interpretations of those compactifications; i.e., they do not represent (in the category-theory sense) any natural moduli problem or, in the precise language, there is no natural moduli stack that would be an analog of moduli stack of stable curves.

=== Non-affine and non-projective example ===
An algebraic variety can be neither affine nor projective. To give an example, let and the projection. Here &quot;X&quot; is an algebraic variety since it is a product of varieties. It is not affine since P1 is a closed subvariety of &quot;X&quot; (as the zero locus of &quot;p&quot;), but an affine variety cannot contain a projective variety of positive dimension as a closed subvariety. It is not projective either, since there is a nonconstant regular function on &quot;X&quot;; namely, &quot;p&quot;.

Another example of a non-affine non-projective variety is (cf. &quot;&quot;.)

=== Non-examples ===
Consider the affine line formula_98 over formula_84. The complement of the circle formula_100 in formula_101 is not an algebraic variety (nor even an algebraic set). Note that formula_102 is not a polynomial in formula_103 (although it is a polynomial in the real coordinates formula_104). On the other hand, the complement of the origin in formula_101 is an algebraic (affine) variety, since the origin is the zero-locus of formula_103. This may be explained as follows: the affine line has dimension one and so any subvariety of it other than itself must have strictly less dimension; namely, zero.

For similar reasons, a unitary group (over the complex numbers) is not an algebraic variety, while the special linear group formula_107 is a closed subvariety of formula_108, the zero-locus of formula_109. (Over a different base field, a unitary group can however be given a structure of a variety.)

==Basic results==
* An affine algebraic set &quot;V&quot; is a variety if and only if &quot;I&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) is a prime ideal; equivalently, &quot;V&quot; is a variety if and only if its coordinate ring is an 
* Every nonempty affine algebraic set may be written uniquely as a finite union of algebraic varieties (where none of the varieties in the decomposition is a subvariety of any other).
* The dimension of a variety may be defined in various equivalent ways. See Dimension of an algebraic variety for details.
* A product of finitely many algebraic varieties (over an algebraically closed field) is an algebraic variety. A finite product of affine varieties is affine and a finite product of projective varieties is projective.

== Isomorphism of algebraic varieties ==

Let be algebraic varieties. We say and are isomorphic, and write , if there are regular maps and such that the compositions and are the identity maps on and respectively.

==Discussion and generalizations==

The basic definitions and facts above enable one to do classical algebraic geometry. To be able to do more — for example, to deal with varieties over fields that are not algebraically closed — some foundational changes are required. The modern notion of a variety is considerably more abstract than the one above, though equivalent in the case of varieties over algebraically closed fields. An &quot;abstract algebraic variety&quot; is a particular kind of scheme; the generalization to schemes on the geometric side enables an extension of the correspondence described above to a wider class of rings. A scheme is a locally ringed space such that every point has a neighbourhood that, as a locally ringed space, is isomorphic to a spectrum of a ring. Basically, a variety over is a scheme whose structure sheaf is a sheaf of -algebras with the property that the rings &quot;R&quot; that occur above are all integral domains and are all finitely generated -algebras, that is to say, they are quotients of polynomial algebras by prime ideals.

This definition works over any field . It allows you to glue affine varieties (along common open sets) without worrying whether the resulting object can be put into some projective space. This also leads to difficulties since one can introduce somewhat pathological objects, e.g. an affine line with zero doubled. Such objects are usually not considered varieties, and are eliminated by requiring the schemes underlying a variety to be &quot;separated&quot;. (Strictly speaking, there is also a third condition, namely, that one needs only finitely many affine patches in the definition above.)

Some modern researchers also remove the restriction on a variety having integral domain affine charts, and when speaking of a variety only require that the affine charts have trivial nilradical.

A complete variety is a variety such that any map from an open subset of a nonsingular curve into it can be extended uniquely to the whole curve. Every projective variety is complete, but not vice versa.

These varieties have been called &quot;varieties in the sense of Serre&quot;, since Serre&#x27;s foundational paper FAC
on sheaf cohomology was written for them. They remain typical objects to start studying in algebraic geometry, even if more general objects are also used in an auxiliary way.

One way that leads to generalizations is to allow reducible algebraic sets (and fields that aren&#x27;t algebraically closed), so the rings &quot;R&quot; may not be integral domains. A more significant modification is to allow nilpotents in the sheaf of rings, that is, rings which are not reduced. This is one of several generalizations of classical algebraic geometry that are built into Grothendieck&#x27;s theory of schemes.

Allowing nilpotent elements in rings is related to keeping track of &quot;multiplicities&quot; in algebraic geometry. For example, the closed subscheme of the affine line defined by &quot;x&quot;2 = 0 is different from the subscheme defined by &quot;x&quot; = 0 (the origin). More generally, the fiber of a morphism of schemes &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; at a point of &quot;Y&quot; may be non-reduced, even if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are reduced. Geometrically, this says that fibers of good mappings may have nontrivial &quot;infinitesimal&quot; structure.

There are further generalizations called algebraic spaces and stacks.

==Algebraic manifolds==

An algebraic manifold is an algebraic variety that is also an &quot;m&quot;-dimensional manifold, and hence every sufficiently small local patch is isomorphic to &quot;km&quot;. Equivalently, the variety is smooth (free from singular points). When is the real numbers, R, algebraic manifolds are called Nash manifolds. Algebraic manifolds can be defined as the zero set of a finite collection of analytic algebraic functions. Projective algebraic manifolds are an equivalent definition for projective varieties. The Riemann sphere is one example.

<doc id="248810" wikidata="Q83966" url="?curid=248810" title="Communication theory">
<text>Communication theory is a proposed description of communication phenomena, the relationships among them, a storyline describing these relationships, and an argument for these three elements. Communication theory provides a way of talking about and analyzing key events, processes, and commitments that together form communication. Theory can be seen as a way to map the world and make it navigable; communication theory gives us tools to answer empirical, conceptual, or practical communication questions.

Communication is defined in both commonsense and specialized ways. Communication theory emphasizes its symbolic and social process aspects as seen from two perspectives—as exchange of information (the transmission perspective), and as work done to connect and thus enable that exchange (the ritual perspective).

Sociolinguistic research in the 1950s and 1960s demonstrated that the level to which people change their formality of their language depends on the social context that they are in. This had been explained in terms of social norms that dictated language use. The way that we use language differs from person to person.

Communication theories have emerged from multiple historical points of origin, including classical traditions of oratory and rhetoric, Enlightenment-era conceptions of society and the mind, and post-World War II efforts to understand propaganda and relationships between media and society. Prominent historical and modern foundational communication theorists include Kurt Lewin, Harold Lasswell, Paul Lazarsfeld, Carl Hovland, James Carey, Elihu Katz, Kenneth Burke, John Dewey, Jurgen Habermas, Marshall McLuhan, Theodor Adorno, Antonio Gramsci, Jean-Luc Nancy, Robert E. Park, George Herbert Mead, Joseph Walther, Claude Shannon,Stuart Hall and Harold Innis–although some of these theorists may not explicitly associate themselves with communication as a discipline or field of study.

==Models and elements of communication theory==
One key activity in communication theory is the development of models and concepts used to describe communication. In the Linear Model, communication works in one direction: a sender encodes some message and sends it through a channel for a receiver to decode. In comparison, the Interactional Model of communication is bidirectional. People send and receive messages in a cooperative fashion as they continuously encode and decode information. The Transactional Model assumes that information is sent and received simultaneously through a noisy channel, and further considers a frame of reference or experience each person brings to the interaction.

Some of the basic elements of communication studied in communication theory are:
* Source: Shannon calls this element the &quot;information source&quot;, which &quot;produces a message or sequence of messages to be communicated to the receiving terminal.&quot;
* Sender: Shannon calls this element the &quot;transmitter&quot;, which &quot;operates on the message in some way to produce a signal suitable for transmission over the channel.&quot; In Aristotle, this element is the &quot;speaker&quot; (orator).
* Channel: For Shannon, the channel is &quot;merely the medium used to transmit the signal from transmitter to receiver.&quot;
* Receiver: For Shannon, the receiver &quot;performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal.&quot;
* Destination: For Shannon, the destination is &quot;the person (or thing) for whom the message is intended&quot;.
* Message: from Latin &quot;mittere&quot;, &quot;to send&quot;. The message is a concept, information, communication, or statement that is sent in a verbal, written, recorded, or visual form to the recipient.
* Feedback
* Entropic elements, positive and negative

==Epistemology in communication theory==
Communication theories vary substantially in their epistemology, and articulating this philosophical commitment is part of the theorizing process. Although the various epistemic positions used in communication theories can vary, one categorization scheme distinguishes among interpretive empirical, metric empirical or post-positivist, rhetorical, and critical epistemologies. Communication theories may also fall within or vary by distinct domains of interest, including information theory, rhetoric and speech, interpersonal communication, organizational communication, sociocultural communication, political communication, computer-mediated communication, and critical perspectives on media and communication.

===Interpretive empirical epistemology===

Interpretive empirical epistemology or interpretivism seeks to develop subjective insight and understanding of communication phenomena through the grounded study of local interactions. When developing or applying an interpretivist theory, the researcher themself is a vital instrument. Theories characteristic of this epistemology include structuration and symbolic interactionism, and frequently associated methods include discourse analysis and ethnography.

===Metric empirical or post-positivist epistemology===

A metric empirical or post-positivist epistemology takes an axiomatic and sometimes causal view of phenomena, developing evidence about association or making predictions, and using methods oriented to measurement of communication phenomena. 
Post-positivist theories are generally evaluated by their accuracy, consistency, fruitfulness, and parsimoniousness. Theories characteristic of a post-positivist epistemology may originate from a wide range of perspectives, including pragmatist, behaviorist, cognitivist, structuralist, or functionalist. Although post-positivist work may be qualitative or quantitative, statistical analysis is a common form of evidence and scholars taking this approach often seek to develop results that can be reproduced by others.

===Rhetorical epistemology===

A rhetorical epistemology lays out a formal, logical, and global view of phenomena with particular concern for persuasion through speech.
A rhetorical epistemology often draws from Greco-Roman foundations such as the works of Aristotle and Cicero although recent work also draws from Michel Foucault, Kenneth Burke, Marxism, second-wave feminism, and cultural studies. Rhetoric has changed overtime. Fields of rhetoric and composition have grown to become more interested in alternative types of rhetoric.

===Critical epistemology===

A critical epistemology is explicitly political and intentional with respect to its standpoint, articulating an ideology and criticizing phenomena with respect to this ideology. A critical epistemology is driven by its values and oriented to social and political change. Communication theories associated with this epistemology include deconstructionism, cultural Marxism, third-wave feminism, and resistance studies.

=== New modes of communication ===
During the mid-1970&#x27;s, presiding paradigm had passed in regards to the development in communication. More specifically the increase in a participatory approach which challenged studies like diffusionism which had dominated the 1950s. There is no valid reason for studying people as an aggregation of specific individuals that have their social experience unified and cancelled out with the means of allowing only the attributes of socio-economic status, age and sex, representative of them except by assuming that the audience is a mass.

==Communication theory by perspective/subdiscipline==
Approaches to theory also vary by perspective or subdiscipline. The communication theory as a field model proposed by Robert Craig has been an influential approach to breaking down the field of communication theory into perspectives, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs.

===Information theory===

In information theory, communication theories examine the technical process of information exchange while typically using mathematics. This perspective on communication theory originated from the development of information theory in the early 1920s. Limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at Bell Labs, all implicitly assuming events of equal probability. The history of information theory as a form of communication theory can be traced through a series of key papers during this time. Harry Nyquist&#x27;s 1924 paper, &quot;Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed&quot;, contains a theoretical section quantifying &quot;intelligence&quot; and the &quot;line speed&quot; at which it can be transmitted by a communication system. Ralph Hartley&#x27;s 1928 paper, &quot;Transmission of Information,&quot; uses the word &quot;information&quot; as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver&#x27;s ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other. The natural unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, much later renamed the hartley in his honour as a unit or scale or measure of information. Alan Turing in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war Enigma ciphers. The main landmark event that opened the way to the development of the information theory form of communication theory was the publication of an article by Claude Shannon (1916–2001) in the &quot;Bell System Technical Journal&quot; in July and October 1948 under the title &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;. Shannon focused on the problem of how best to encode the information that a sender wants to transmit. He also used tools in probability theory, developed by Norbert Wiener.

They marked the nascent stages of applied communication theory at that time. Shannon developed information entropy as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of information theory. &quot;The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point.&quot; In 1949, in a declassified version of Shannon&#x27;s wartime work on the mathematical theory of cryptography (&quot;Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems&quot;), he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad. He is also credited with the introduction of sampling theory, which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later. In 1951, Shannon made his fundamental contribution to natural language processing and computational linguistics with his article &quot;Prediction and Entropy of Printed English&quot; (1951), providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.

===Interpersonal communication===

Theories in interpersonal communication are concerned with the ways in which very small groups of people communicate with one another. It also provides the framework in which we view the world around us. Although interpersonal communication theories have their origin in mass communication studies of attitude and response to messages, since the 1970s, interpersonal communication theories have taken on a distinctly personal focus. Interpersonal theories examine relationships and their development, non-verbal communication, how we adapt to one another during conversation, how we develop the messages we seek to convey, and how deception works. 

===Organizational communication===

Organizational communication theories address not only the ways in which people use communication in organizations, but also how they use communication to constitute that organization, developing structures, relationships, and practices to achieve their goals. Although early organization communication theories were characterized by a so-called container model (the idea that an organization is a clearly bounded object inside which communication happens in a straightforward manner following hierarchical lines), more recent theories have viewed the organization as a more fluid entity with fuzzy boundaries. Studies within the field of organizational communication mention communication as a facilitating act and a precursor to organizational activity as cooperative systems.

Given that its object of study is the organization, it is perhaps not surprising that organization communication scholarship has important connections to theories of management, with Management Communication Quarterly serving as a key venue for disseminating scholarly work. However, theories in organizational communication retain a distinct identity through their critical perspective toward power and attention to the needs and interests of workers, rather than privileging the will of management.

Organizational communication can be distinguished by its orientation to four key problematics: voice (who can speak within an organization), rationality (how decisions are made and whose ends are served), organization (how is the organization itself structured and how does it function), and the organization-society relationship (how the organization may alternately serve, exploit, and reflect society as a whole).

===Sociocultural communication===
This line of theory examines how social order is both produced and reproduced through communication. Communication problems in the sociocultural tradition may be theorized in terms of misalignment, conflict, or coordination failure. Theories in this domain explore dynamics such as micro and macro level phenomena, structure versus agency, the local versus the global, and communication problems which emerge due to gaps of space and time, sharing some kinship with sociological and anthropological perspectives 
but distinguished by keen attention to communication as constructed and constitutive.

===Political communication===

Political communication theories are concerned with the public exchange of messages among political actors of all kinds. This scope is in contrast to theories of political science which look inside political institutions to understand decision-making processes.
Early political communication theories examined the roles of mass communication (i.e. television and newspapers) and political parties on political discourse. However, as the conduct of political discourse has expanded, 
theories of political communication have likewise developed, to now include models of deliberation and sensemaking, and discourses about a wide range of political topics: the role of the media (e.g. as a gatekeeper, framer, and agenda-setter); forms of government (e.g. democracy, populism, and autocracy); social change (e.g. activism and protests); economic order (e.g. capitalism, neoliberalism and socialism); human values (e.g. rights, norms, freedom, and authority.); and propaganda, disinformation, and trust.
Two of the important emerging areas for theorizing about political communication are the examination of civic engagement and international comparative work (given that much of political communication has been done in the United States).

===Computer-mediated communication===

Theories of computer-mediated communication or CMC emerged as a direct response to the rapid emergence of novel mediating communication technologies in the form of computers. CMC scholars inquire as to what may be lost and what may be gained when we shift many of our formerly unmediated and entrained practices (that is, activities that were necessarily conducted in a synchronized, ordered, dependent fashion) into mediated and disentrained modes. For example, a discussion that once required a meeting can now be an e-mail thread, an appointment confirmation that once involved a live phone call can now be a click on a text message, a collaborative writing project that once required an elaborate plan for drafting, circulating, and annotating can now take place in a shared document.

CMC theories fall into three categories: cues-filtered-out theories, experiential/perceptual theories, and adaptation to/exploitation of media. Cues-filtered-out theories have often treated face-to-face interaction as the gold standard against which mediated communication should be compared, and includes such theories as social presence theory, media richness theory, and the Social Identity model of Deindividuation Effects (SIDE). Experiential/perceptual theories are concerned with how individuals perceive the capacity of technologies, such as whether the technology creates psychological closeness (electronic propinquity theory). 
Adaptation/exploitation theories consider how people may creatively expand or make use of the limitations in CMC systems, including social information processing theory (SIP) and the idea of the hyperpersonal (when people make use of the limitations of the mediated channel to create a selective view of themselves with their communication partner, developing an impression that exceeds reality). Theoretical work from Joseph Walther has been highly influential in the development of CMC.
Theories in this area often examine the limitations and capabilities of new technologies, taking up an &#x27;affordances&#x27; perspective inquiring what the technology may &quot;request, demand, encourage, discourage, refuse, and allow.&quot; Recently the theoretical and empirical focus of CMC has shifted more explicitly away from the &#x27;C&#x27; (i.e. Computer) and toward the &#x27;M&#x27; (i.e. Mediation).

===Rhetoric and speech===

Theories in rhetoric and speech are often concerned with discourse as an art, including practical consideration of the power of words and our ability to improve our skills through practice. Rhetorical theories provide a way of analyzing speeches when read in an exegetical manner (close, repeated reading to extract themes, metaphors, techniques, argument, meaning, etc.); for example with respect to their relationship to power or justice, or their persuasion, emotional appeal, or logic.

===Critical perspectives on media and communication===

Critical social theory in communication, while sharing some traditions with rhetoric, is explicitly oriented toward &quot;articulating, questioning, and transcending presuppositions that are judged to be untrue, dishonest, or unjust.&quot;(p. 147) Some work bridges this distinction to form critical rhetoric. Critical theories have their roots in the Frankfurt School, which brought together anti-establishment thinkers alarmed by the rise of Nazism and propaganda, including the work of Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno. Modern critical perspectives often engage with emergent social movements such as post-colonialism and queer theory, seeking to be reflective and emancipatory. One of the influential bodies of theory in this area comes from the work of Stuart Hall, who questioned traditional assumptions about the monolithic functioning of mass communication with his Encoding/Decoding Model of Communication and offered significant expansions of theories of discourse, semiotics, and power through media criticism and explorations of linguistic codes and cultural identity.

== Axiology ==

Axiology is concerned with how values inform research and theory development. Most communication theory is guided by one of three axiological approaches. The first approach recognizes that values will influence theorists&#x27; interests but suggests that those values must be set aside once actual research begins. Outside replication of research findings is particularly important in this approach to prevent individual researchers&#x27; values from contaminating their findings and interpretations. The second approach rejects the idea that values can be eliminated from any stage of theory development. Within this approach, theorists do not try to divorce their values from inquiry. Instead, they remain mindful of their values so that they understand how those values contextualize, influence or skew their findings. The third approach not only rejects the idea that values can be separated from research and theory, but rejects the idea that they should be separated. This approach is often adopted by critical theorists who believe that the role of communication theory is to identify oppression and produce social change. In this axiological approach, theorists embrace their values and work to reproduce those values in their research and theory development.

<doc id="248859" wikidata="Q144535" url="?curid=248859" title="Herbert Spencer">
<text>Herbert Spencer (27 April 1820 – 8 December 1903) was an English polymath active as a philosopher, psychologist, biologist, sociologist, and anthropologist. Spencer originated the expression &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, which he coined in &quot;Principles of Biology&quot; (1864) after reading Charles Darwin&#x27;s 1859 book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;. The term strongly suggests natural selection, yet Spencer saw evolution as extending into realms of sociology and ethics, so he also supported Lamarckism.

Spencer developed an all-embracing conception of evolution as the progressive development of the physical world, biological organisms, the human mind, and human culture and societies. As a polymath, he contributed to a wide range of subjects, including ethics, religion, anthropology, economics, political theory, philosophy, literature, astronomy, biology, sociology, and psychology. During his lifetime he achieved tremendous authority, mainly in English-speaking academia. Spencer was &quot;the single most famous European intellectual in the closing decades of the nineteenth century&quot; but his influence declined sharply after 1900: &quot;Who now reads Spencer?&quot; asked Talcott Parsons in 1937.

==Early life and education==
Spencer was born in Derby, Derbyshire, England, on 27 April 1820, the son of William George Spencer (generally called George). Spencer&#x27;s father was a religious dissenter who drifted from Methodism to Quakerism, and who seems to have transmitted to his son an opposition to all forms of authority. He ran a school founded on the progressive teaching methods of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and also served as Secretary of the Derby Philosophical Society, a scientific society which had been founded in 1783 by Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles Darwin.

Spencer was educated in empirical science by his father, while the members of the Derby Philosophical Society introduced him to pre-Darwinian concepts of biological evolution, particularly those of Erasmus Darwin and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. His uncle, the Reverend Thomas Spencer, vicar of Hinton Charterhouse near Bath, completed Spencer&#x27;s limited formal education by teaching him some mathematics and physics, and enough Latin to enable him to translate some easy texts. Thomas Spencer also imprinted on his nephew his own firm free-trade and anti-statist political views. Otherwise, Spencer was an autodidact who acquired most of his knowledge from narrowly focused readings and conversations with his friends and acquaintances.

==Career==

Both as an adolescent and as a young man, Spencer found it difficult to settle to any intellectual or professional discipline. He worked as a civil engineer during the railway boom of the late 1830s, while also devoting much of his time to writing for provincial journals that were nonconformist in their religion and radical in their politics.

===Writing===
Spencer published his first book, &quot;Social Statics&quot; (1851), whilst working as sub-editor on the free-trade journal &quot;The Economist&quot; from 1848 to 1853. He predicted that humanity would eventually become completely adapted to the requirements of living in society with the consequential withering away of the state. Its publisher, John Chapman, introduced Spencer to his salon which was attended by many of the leading radical and progressive thinkers of the capital, including John Stuart Mill, Harriet Martineau, George Henry Lewes and Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot), with whom he was briefly romantically linked. Spencer himself introduced the biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, who would later win fame as &#x27;Darwin&#x27;s Bulldog&#x27; and who remained Spencer&#x27;s lifelong friend. However, it was the friendship of Evans and Lewes that acquainted him with John Stuart Mill&#x27;s &quot;A System of Logic&quot; and with Auguste Comte&#x27;s positivism and which set him on the road to his life&#x27;s work. He strongly disagreed with Comte.

Spencer&#x27;s second book, &quot;Principles of Psychology&quot;, published in 1855, explored a physiological basis for psychology, and was the fruit of his friendship with Evans and Lewes. The book was founded on his fundamental assumption that the human mind is subject to natural laws and that these can be discovered within the framework of general biology. This permitted the adoption of a developmental perspective not merely in terms of the individual (as in traditional psychology), but also of the species and the race. Through this paradigm, Spencer aimed to reconcile the associationist psychology of Mill&#x27;s &quot;Logic&quot;, the notion that the human mind is constructed from atomic sensations held together by the laws of the association of ideas, with the apparently more &#x27;scientific&#x27; theory of phrenology, which locates specific mental functions in specific parts of the brain.

Spencer argued that both these theories are partial accounts of the truth: repeated associations of ideas are embodied in the formation of specific strands of brain tissue, and these can be passed from one generation to the next by means of the Lamarckian mechanism of use-inheritance. The &quot;Psychology&quot;, he believed, would do for the human mind what Isaac Newton had done for matter. However, the book was not initially successful and the last of the 251 copies of its first edition were not sold until June 1861.

Spencer&#x27;s interest in psychology derived from a more fundamental concern which was to establish the universality of natural law. In common with others of his generation, including the members of Chapman&#x27;s salon, he was possessed with the idea of demonstrating that it is possible to show that everything in the universe – including human culture, language, and morality – could be explained by laws of universal validity. This was in contrast to the views of many theologians of the time who insisted that some parts of creation, in particular the human soul, are beyond the realm of scientific investigation. Comte&#x27;s &quot;Système de Philosophie Positive&quot; had been written with the ambition of demonstrating the universality of natural law, and Spencer was to follow Comte in the scale of his ambition. However, Spencer differed from Comte in believing it is possible to discover a single law of universal application which he identified with progressive development and was to call the principle of evolution.

In 1858, Spencer produced an outline of what was to become the System of Synthetic Philosophy. This immense undertaking, which has few parallels in the English language, aimed to demonstrate that the principle of evolution applies in biology, psychology, sociology (Spencer appropriated Comte&#x27;s term for the new discipline) and morality. Spencer envisaged that this work of ten volumes would take twenty years to complete; in the end, it took him twice as long and consumed almost all the rest of his long life.

Despite Spencer&#x27;s early struggles to establish himself as a writer, by the 1870s he had become the most famous philosopher of the age. His works were widely read during his lifetime, and by 1869 he was able to support himself solely on the profit of book sales and on income from his regular contributions to Victorian periodicals which were collected as three volumes of &quot;Essays&quot;. His works were translated into German, Italian, Spanish, French, Russian, Japanese and Chinese, and into many other languages and he was offered honours and awards all over Europe and North America. He also became a member of the Athenaeum, an exclusive Gentleman&#x27;s Club in London open only to those distinguished in the arts and sciences, and the X Club, a dining club of nine founded by T.H. Huxley that met every month and included some of the most prominent thinkers of the Victorian age (three of whom would become presidents of the Royal Society).

Members included physicist-philosopher John Tyndall and Darwin&#x27;s cousin, the banker and biologist Sir John Lubbock. There were also some quite significant satellites such as liberal clergyman Arthur Stanley, the Dean of Westminster; and guests such as Charles Darwin and Hermann von Helmholtz were entertained from time to time. Through such associations, Spencer had a strong presence in the heart of the scientific community and was able to secure an influential audience for his views.

===Later life===
The last decades of Spencer&#x27;s life were characterised by growing disillusionment and loneliness. He never married, and after 1855 was a life-long hypochondriac who complained endlessly of pains and maladies that no physician could diagnose at that time. His excitability and sensitivity to disagreement handicapped his social life:His nervous sensibility was extreme. A game of billiards was enough to deprive him of his night&#x27;s rest. He had been looking forward with pleasure to a meeting with Huxley; but he gave it up because there was a difference on some scientific question between them, and this might have given rise to an argument, which Spencer&#x27;s nerves could not bear. By the 1890s his readership had begun to desert him while many of his closest friends died and he had come to doubt the confident faith in progress that he had made the centre-piece of his philosophical system. His later years were also ones in which his political views became increasingly conservative. Whereas &quot;Social Statics&quot; had been the work of a radical democrat who believed in votes for women (and even for children) and in the nationalisation of the land to break the power of the aristocracy, by the 1880s he had become a staunch opponent of female suffrage and made common cause with the landowners of the Liberty and Property Defence League against what they saw as the drift towards &#x27;socialism&#x27; of elements (such as Sir William Harcourt) within the administration of William Ewart Gladstone – largely against the opinions of Gladstone himself. Spencer&#x27;s political views from this period were expressed in what has become his most famous work, &quot;The Man Versus the State&quot;.

The exception to Spencer&#x27;s growing conservatism was that he remained throughout his life an ardent opponent of imperialism and militarism. His critique of the Boer War was especially scathing, and it contributed to his declining popularity in Britain.

He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1883.

===Invention of paper-clip===
Spencer also invented a precursor to the modern paper clip, though it looked more like a modern cotter pin. This &quot;binding-pin&quot; was distributed by Ackermann &amp; Company. Spencer shows drawings of the pin in Appendix I (following Appendix H) of his autobiography along with published descriptions of its uses.

===Death and legacy===
In 1902, shortly before his death, Spencer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for literature, which was assigned to the German Theodor Mommsen. He continued writing all his life, in later years often by dictation, until he succumbed to poor health at the age of 83. His ashes are interred in the eastern side of London&#x27;s Highgate Cemetery facing Karl Marx&#x27;s grave. At Spencer&#x27;s funeral, the Indian nationalist leader Shyamji Krishna Varma announced a donation of £1,000 to establish a lectureship at Oxford University in tribute to Spencer and his work.

==Synthetic philosophy==
The basis for Spencer&#x27;s appeal to many of his generation was that he appeared to offer a ready-made system of belief which could substitute for conventional religious faith at a time when orthodox creeds were crumbling under the advances of modern science. Spencer&#x27;s philosophical system seemed to demonstrate that it is possible to believe in the ultimate perfection of humanity on the basis of advanced scientific conceptions such as the first law of thermodynamics and biological evolution.

In essence, Spencer&#x27;s philosophical vision was formed by a combination of deism and positivism. On the one hand, he had imbibed something of eighteenth-century deism from his father and other members of the Derby Philosophical Society and from books like George Combe&#x27;s immensely popular &quot;The Constitution of Man&quot; (1828). This treated the world as a cosmos of benevolent design, and the laws of nature as the decrees of a &#x27;Being transcendentally kind.&#x27; Natural laws are thus the statutes of a well-governed universe that have been decreed by the Creator with the intention of promoting human happiness. Although Spencer lost his Christian faith as a teenager and later rejected any &#x27;anthropomorphic&#x27; conception of the Deity, he nonetheless held fast to this conception at an almost subconscious level. At the same time, however, he owed far more than he would ever acknowledge to positivism, in particular in its conception of a philosophical system as the unification of the various branches of scientific knowledge. He also followed positivism in his insistence that it is only possible to have genuine knowledge of phenomena and hence that it is idle to speculate about the nature of the ultimate reality. The tension between positivism and his residual deism ran through the entire System of Synthetic Philosophy.

Spencer followed Comte in aiming for the unification of scientific truth; it was in this sense that his philosophy aimed to be &#x27;synthetic.&#x27; Like Comte, he was committed to the universality of natural law, the idea that the laws of nature apply without exception, to the organic realm as much as to the inorganic, and to the human mind as much as to the rest of creation. The first objective of Synthetic Philosophy was thus to demonstrate that there are no exceptions to being able to discover scientific explanations, in the form of natural laws, of all the phenomena of the universe. Spencer&#x27;s volumes on biology, psychology, and sociology were all intended to demonstrate the existence of natural laws in these specific disciplines. Even in his writings on ethics, he held that it is possible to discover &#x27;laws&#x27; of morality that have the status of laws of nature while still having normative content, a conception which can be traced to George Combe&#x27;s &quot;Constitution of Man&quot;.

The second objective of the Synthetic Philosophy was to show that these same laws lead inexorably to progress. In contrast to Comte, who stressed only the unity of the scientific method, Spencer sought the unification of scientific knowledge in the form of the reduction of all natural laws to one fundamental law, the law of evolution. In this respect, he followed the model laid down by the Edinburgh publisher Robert Chambers in his anonymous &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; (1844). Although often dismissed as a lightweight forerunner of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;, Chambers&#x27; book was, in reality, a programme for the unification of science which aimed to show that Laplace&#x27;s nebular hypothesis for the origin of the solar system and Lamarck&#x27;s theory of species transformation are both instances of &#x27;one magnificent generalisation of progressive development&#x27; (Lewes&#x27; phrase). Chambers was associated with Chapman&#x27;s salon and his work served as the unacknowledged template for the Synthetic Philosophy. 
==Evolution==

Spencer first articulated his evolutionary perspective in his essay, &#x27;Progress: Its Law and Cause&#x27;, published in Chapman&#x27;s &quot;Westminster Review&quot; in 1857, and which later formed the basis of the &quot;First Principles of a New System of Philosophy&quot; (1862). In it he expounded a theory of evolution which combines insights from Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s essay &#x27;The Theory of Life&#x27; – itself derivative from Friedrich von Schelling&#x27;s Naturphilosophie – with a generalisation of von Baer&#x27;s law of embryological development. Spencer posited that all structures in the universe develop from a simple, undifferentiated, homogeneity to a complex, differentiated, heterogeneity while undergoing increasing integration of the differentiated parts. This evolutionary process can be observed, Spencer believed, throughout the cosmos. It is a universal law, applying to the stars and galaxies and to biological organisms, and to human social organisation and to the human mind. It differed from other scientific laws only in its greater generality, and the laws of the special sciences can be shown to be illustrations of this principle.

The principles described by Herbert Spencer received a variety of interpretations. Bertrand Russell stated in a letter to Beatrice Webb in 1923: &#x27;I don&#x27;t know whether [Spencer] was ever made to realize the implications of the second law of thermodynamics; if so, he may well be upset. The law says that everything tends to uniformity and a dead level, diminishing (not increasing) heterogeneity&#x27;.

Spencer&#x27;s attempt to explain the evolution of complexity was radically different from that of Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot; which was published two years later. Spencer is often, quite erroneously, believed to have merely appropriated and generalised Darwin&#x27;s work on natural selection. But although after reading Darwin&#x27;s work he coined the phrase &#x27;survival of the fittest&#x27; as his own term for Darwin&#x27;s concept, and is often misrepresented as a thinker who merely applied the Darwinian theory to society, he only grudgingly incorporated natural selection into his preexisting overall system. The primary mechanism of species transformation that he recognised was Lamarckian use-inheritance which posited that organs are developed or are diminished by use or disuse and that the resulting changes may be transmitted to future generations. Spencer believed that this evolutionary mechanism is also necessary to explain &#x27;higher&#x27; evolution, especially the social development of humanity. Moreover, in contrast to Darwin, he held that evolution has a direction and an end-point, the attainment of a final state of equilibrium. He tried to apply the theory of biological evolution to sociology. He proposed that society is the product of change from lower to higher forms, just as in the theory of biological evolution, the lowest forms of life are said to be evolving into higher forms. Spencer claimed that man&#x27;s mind has evolved in the same way from the simple automatic responses of lower animals to the process of reasoning in the thinking man. Spencer believed in two kinds of knowledge: knowledge gained by the individual and knowledge gained by the race. According to his thinking, intuition or knowledge learned unconsciously is the inherited experience of the race.

Spencer in his book &quot;Principles of Biology&quot; (1864), proposed a pangenesis theory that involves &quot;physiological units&quot; assumed to be related to specific body parts and responsible for the transmission of characteristics to offspring. These hypothetical hereditary units are similar to Darwin&#x27;s gemmules.

==Sociology==

Spencer read with excitement the original positivist sociology of Auguste Comte. A philosopher of science, Comte had proposed a theory of sociocultural evolution that society progresses by a general law of three stages. Writing after various developments in biology, however, Spencer rejected what he regarded as the ideological aspects of Comte&#x27;s positivism, attempting to reformulate social science in terms of his principle of evolution, which he applied to the biological, psychological and sociological aspects of the universe. Spencer is also generally credited as the first to use the term &#x27;social structure.&#x27;

Given the primacy which Spencer placed on evolution, his sociology might be described as social Darwinism mixed with Lamarckism. However, despite its popularity, this view of Spencer&#x27;s sociology is mistaken. While his political and ethical writings have themes consistent with social Darwinism, such themes are absent in Spencer&#x27;s sociological works, which focus on how processes of societal growth and differentiation lead to changing degrees of complexity in social organization.

The evolutionary progression from simple, undifferentiated homogeneity to complex, differentiated heterogeneity is exemplified, Spencer argued, by the development of society. He developed a theory of two types of society, the militant and the industrial, which corresponded to this evolutionary progression. Militant society, structured around relationships of hierarchy and obedience, is simple and undifferentiated; industrial society, based on voluntary, contractually assumed social obligations, is complex and differentiated. Society, which Spencer conceptualised as a &#x27;social organism&#x27; evolved from the simpler state to the more complex according to the universal law of evolution. Moreover, industrial society is the direct descendant of the ideal society developed in &quot;Social Statics&quot;, although Spencer now equivocated over whether the evolution of society would result in anarchism (as he had first believed) or whether it points to a continued role for the state, albeit one reduced to the minimal functions of the enforcement of contracts and external defence.

Though Spencer made some valuable contributions to early sociology, not least in his influence on structural functionalism, his attempt to introduce Lamarckian or Darwinian ideas into the realm of sociology was unsuccessful. It was considered by many, furthermore, to be actively dangerous. Hermeneuticians of the period, such as Wilhelm Dilthey, would pioneer the distinction between the natural sciences (&quot;Naturwissenschaften&quot;) and human sciences (&quot;Geisteswissenschaften&quot;). In the United States, the sociologist Lester Frank Ward, who would be elected as the first president of the American Sociological Association, launched a relentless attack on Spencer&#x27;s theories of laissez-faire and political ethics. Although Ward admired much of Spencer&#x27;s work, he believed that Spencer&#x27;s prior political biases had distorted his thought and had led him astray. In the 1890s, Émile Durkheim established formal academic sociology with a firm emphasis on practical social research. By the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists, most notably Max Weber, had presented methodological antipositivism. However, Spencer&#x27;s theories of laissez-faire, survival-of-the-fittest and minimal human interference in the processes of natural law had an enduring and even increasing appeal in the social science fields of economics and political science, and one writer has recently made the case for Spencer&#x27;s importance for a sociology that must learn to take energy in society seriously.

==Ethics==
Spencer predicted in his first book that the endpoint of the evolutionary process will be the creation of &#x27;the perfect man in the perfect society&#x27; with human beings becoming completely adapted to social life. The chief difference between Spencer&#x27;s earlier and later conceptions of this process is the evolutionary timescale involved. The psychological – and hence also the moral – constitution which has been bequeathed to the present generation by our ancestors, and which we in turn will hand on to future generations, is in the process of gradual adaptation to the requirements of living in society. For example, aggression is a survival instinct which was necessary in the primitive conditions of life, but is maladaptive in advanced societies. Because human instincts have a specific location in strands of brain tissue, they are subject to the Lamarckian mechanism of use-inheritance so that gradual modifications could be transmitted to future generations. Over the course of many generations, the evolutionary process will ensure that human beings will become less aggressive and increasingly altruistic, leading eventually to a perfect society in which no one would cause another person pain.

However, Spencer held, for evolution to produce the perfect individual, it is necessary for present and future generations to experience the &#x27;natural&#x27; consequences of their conduct. Only in this way will individuals have the incentives required to work on self-improvement and thus to hand an improved moral constitution to their descendants. Hence anything that interferes with the &#x27;natural&#x27; relationship of conduct and consequence was to be resisted and this included the use of the coercive power of the state to relieve poverty, to provide public education, or to require compulsory vaccination. Although charitable giving is to be encouraged, even it has to be limited by the consideration that suffering is frequently the result of individuals receiving the consequences of their actions. Hence too much individual benevolence directed to the &#x27;undeserving poor&#x27; would break the link between conduct and consequence that Spencer considered fundamental to ensuring that humanity continues to evolve to a higher level of development.

Spencer adopted a utilitarian standard of ultimate value – the greatest happiness of the greatest number – and the culmination of the evolutionary process will be the maximization of utility. In the perfect society, individuals would not only derive pleasure from the exercise of altruism (&#x27;positive beneficence&#x27;) but would aim to avoid inflicting pain on others (&#x27;negative beneficence&#x27;). They would also instinctively respect the rights of others, leading to the universal observance of the principle of justice – each person had the right to a maximum amount of liberty that was compatible with a like liberty in others. &#x27;Liberty&#x27; is interpreted to mean the absence of coercion, and is closely connected to the right to private property. Spencer termed this code of conduct &#x27;Absolute Ethics&#x27; which provided a scientifically grounded moral system that could substitute for the supernaturally-based ethical systems of the past. However, he recognized that our inherited moral constitution does not currently permit us to behave in full compliance with the code of Absolute Ethics, and for this reason, we need a code of &#x27;Relative Ethics&#x27; which takes into account the distorting factors of our present imperfections.

Spencer&#x27;s distinctive view of musicology was also related to his ethics. Spencer thought that the origin of music is to be found in impassioned oratory. Speakers have persuasive effect not only by the reasoning of their words, but by their cadence and tone – the musical qualities of their voice serve as &quot;the commentary of the emotions upon the propositions of the intellect,&quot; as Spencer put it. Music, conceived as the heightened development of this characteristic of speech, makes a contribution to the ethical education and progress of the species. &quot;The strange capacity which we have for being affected by melody and harmony, may be taken to imply both that it is within the possibilities of our nature to realize those intenser delights they dimly suggest, and that they are in some way concerned in the realization of them. If so the power and the meaning of music become comprehensible; but otherwise they are a mystery.&quot;

Spencer&#x27;s last years were characterized by a collapse of his initial optimism, replaced instead by a pessimism regarding the future of mankind. Nevertheless, he devoted much of his efforts to reinforcing his arguments and preventing the misinterpretation of his monumental theory of non-interference.

==Agnosticism==
Spencer&#x27;s reputation among the Victorians owed a great deal to his agnosticism. He rejected theology as representing the &#x27;impiety of the pious.&#x27; He was to gain much notoriety from his repudiation of traditional religion, and was frequently condemned by religious thinkers for allegedly advocating atheism and materialism. Nonetheless, unlike Thomas Henry Huxley, whose agnosticism was a militant creed directed at &#x27;the unpardonable sin of faith&#x27; (in Adrian Desmond&#x27;s phrase), Spencer insisted that he was not concerned with undermining religion in the name of science, but to bring about a reconciliation of the two. The following argument is a summary of Part 1 of his &quot;First Principles&quot; (2nd ed. 1867).

Starting either from religious belief or from science, Spencer argued, we are ultimately driven to accept certain indispensable but literally inconceivable notions. Whether we are concerned with a Creator or the substratum which underlies our experience of phenomena, we can frame no conception of it. Therefore, Spencer concluded, religion and science agree in the supreme truth that human understanding is only capable of &#x27;relative&#x27; knowledge. This is the case since, owing to the inherent limitations of the human mind, it is only possible to obtain knowledge of phenomena, not of the reality (&#x27;the absolute&#x27;) underlying phenomena. Hence both science and religion must come to recognise as the &#x27;most certain of all facts that the Power which the Universe manifests to us is utterly inscrutable.&#x27; He called this awareness of &#x27;the Unknowable&#x27; and he presented worship of the Unknowable as capable of being a positive faith which could substitute for conventional religion. Indeed, he thought that the Unknowable represents the ultimate stage in the evolution of religion, the final elimination of its last anthropomorphic vestiges.

==Political views==
Spencerian views in 21st-century circulation derive from his political theories and memorable attacks on the reform movements of the late 19th century. He has been claimed as a precursor by right-libertarians and anarcho-capitalists. Austrian School economist Murray Rothbard called &quot;Social Statics&quot; &quot;the greatest single work of libertarian political philosophy ever written.&quot; Spencer argued that the state is not an &quot;essential&quot; institution and that it will &quot;decay&quot; as a voluntary market organisation comes to replace the coercive aspects of the state. He also argued that the individual has a &quot;right to ignore the state.&quot; As a result of this perspective, Spencer was harshly critical of imperialism. In response to being told that British troops were in danger during the Second Afghan War (1878–1880) he replied: &quot;When men hire themselves out to shoot other men to order, asking nothing about the justice of their cause, I don&#x27;t care if they are shot themselves.&quot;

Politics in late Victorian Britain moved in directions that Spencer disliked, and his arguments provided so much ammunition for conservatives and individualists in Europe and America that they are still in use in the 21st century. The expression &quot;There is no alternative&quot; (TINA), made famous by prime minister Margaret Thatcher, may be traced to its emphatic use by Spencer. By the 1880s, he was denouncing &quot;the new Toryism&quot;, that is, the &quot;social reformist wing&quot; of the Liberal Party, the wing to some extent hostile to prime minister William Ewart Gladstone. This faction of the Liberal Party Spencer compared to the interventionist &quot;Toryism&quot; of such people as the former Conservative Party prime minister Benjamin Disraeli. In &quot;The Man Versus the State&quot; (1884), he attacked Gladstone and the Liberal Party for losing its proper mission (they should be defending personal liberty, he said) and instead promoting paternalist social legislation (what Gladstone himself called &quot;Construction&quot;, an element in the modern Liberal party that he opposed). Spencer denounced Irish land reform, compulsory education, laws to regulate safety at work, prohibition and temperance laws, tax-funded libraries, and welfare reforms. His main objections were threefold: the use of the coercive powers of the government, the discouragement given to voluntary self-improvement, and the disregard of the &quot;laws of life&quot;. The reforms, he said, were tantamount to &quot;socialism&quot;, which he said was about the same as &quot;slavery&quot; in terms of limiting human freedom. Spencer vehemently attacked the widespread enthusiasm for the annexation of colonies and imperial expansion, which subverted all he had predicted about evolutionary progress from &#x27;militant&#x27; to &#x27;industrial&#x27; societies and states.

Spencer anticipated many of the analytical standpoints of later right-libertarian theorists such as Friedrich Hayek, especially in his &quot;law of equal liberty&quot;, his insistence on the limits to predictive knowledge, his model of spontaneous social order, and his warnings about the &quot;unintended consequences&quot; of collectivist social reforms. While often caricatured as ultra-conservative, Spencer had been more radical, or left-libertarian, earlier in his career, opposing private property in land and claiming that each person has a latent claim to participate in the use of the earth (views that influenced Georgism), calling himself &quot;a radical feminist&quot; and advocating the organisation of trade unions as a bulwark against &quot;exploitation by bosses&quot;, and favoured an economy organised primarily in free worker co-operatives as a replacement for wage-labor. Although he retained support for unions, his views on the other issues had changed by the 1880s. He came to predict that social welfare programmes would eventually lead to the socialisation of the means of production, saying &quot;all socialism is slavery.&quot; Spencer defined a slave as a person who &quot;labours under coercion to satisfy another&#x27;s desires&quot; and believed that under socialism or communism the individual would be enslaved to the whole community rather than to a particular master, and &quot;it means not whether his master is a single person or society.&quot;

=== Social Darwinism and racial views ===
For many, the name of Herbert Spencer is virtually synonymous with Social Darwinism, a social theory that applies the law of the survival of the fittest to society and is integrally related to the nineteenth-century rise in scientific racism. In his famed work &quot;Social Statics&quot; (1850), he argued that imperialism had served civilization by clearing the inferior races off the earth: &quot;The forces which are working out the great scheme of perfect happiness, taking no account of incidental suffering, exterminate such sections of mankind as stand in their way. … Be he human or be he brute – the hindrance must be got rid of.&quot; Yet, in the same work, Spencer goes on to say that the incidental evolutionary benefits derived from such barbarous practices do not serve as justifications for them going forward.

Spencer&#x27;s association with social Darwinism might have its origin in a specific interpretation of his support for competition. Whereas in biology the competition of various organisms can result in the death of a species or organism, the kind of competition Spencer advocated is closer to the one used by economists, where competing individuals or firms improve the well-being of the rest of society. Spencer viewed private charity positively, encouraging both voluntary association and informal care to aid those in need, rather than relying on government bureaucracy or force. He further recommended that private charitable efforts would be wise to avoid encouraging the formation of new dependent families by those unable to support themselves without charity. Focusing on the form as well as the content of Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Synthetic Philosophy&quot;, one writer has identified it as the paradigmatic case of &quot;social Darwinism&quot;, understood as a politically motivated metaphysic very different in both form and motivation from Darwinist science.

In a letter to the Japanese government regarding intermarriage with Westerners, Spencer stated that &quot;if you mix the constitution of two widely divergent varieties which have severally become adapted to widely divergent modes of life, you get a constitution which is adapted to the mode of life of neithera constitution which will not work properly.&quot; He goes on to say that America has failed to limit the immigration of Chinese and restrict their contact, especially sexual, with the presumed European stock. He states &quot;if they mix they must form a bad hybrid&quot; regarding the issue of Chinese and (ethnically European) Americans. Spencer ends his letter with the following blanket statement against all immigration: &quot;In either case, supposing the immigration to be large, immense social mischief must arise, and eventually social disorganization. The same thing will happen if there should be any considerable mixture of European or American races with the Japanese.&quot;

==General influence==
While most philosophers fail to achieve much of a following outside the academy of their professional peers, by the 1870s and 1880s Spencer had achieved an unparalleled popularity, as the sheer volume of his sales indicate. He was perhaps the only philosopher in history to sell over a million copies of his works during his own lifetime. In the United States, where pirated editions were still commonplace, his authorised publisher, Appleton, sold 368,755 copies between 1860 and 1903. This figure did not differ much from his sales in his native Britain, and, once editions in the rest of the world are added in, the figure of a million copies seems like a conservative estimate. As William James remarked, Spencer &quot;enlarged the imagination, and set free the speculative mind of countless doctors, engineers, and lawyers, of many physicists and chemists, and of thoughtful laymen generally.&quot; The aspect of his thought that emphasised individual self-improvement found a ready audience in the skilled working class.

Spencer&#x27;s influence among leaders of thought was also immense, though it was most often expressed in terms of their reaction to, and repudiation of, his ideas. As his American follower John Fiske observed, Spencer&#x27;s ideas were to be found &quot;running like the weft through all the warp&quot; of Victorian thought. Such varied thinkers as Henry Sidgwick, T.H. Green, G.E. Moore, William James, Henri Bergson, and Émile Durkheim defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim&#x27;s &quot;Division of Labour in Society&quot; is to a very large extent an extended debate with Spencer, from whose sociology, many commentators now agree, Durkheim borrowed extensively.

In post-1863-Uprising Poland, many of Spencer&#x27;s ideas became integral to the dominant ideology, &quot;Polish Positivism&quot;. The leading Polish writer of the period, Bolesław Prus, hailed Spencer as &quot;the Aristotle of the nineteenth century&quot; and adopted Spencer&#x27;s metaphor of society-as-organism, giving it a striking poetic presentation in his 1884 micro-story, &quot;Mold of the Earth&quot;, and highlighting the concept in the introduction to his most universal novel, &quot;Pharaoh&quot; (1895).

The early 20th century was hostile to Spencer. Soon after his death, his philosophical reputation went into a sharp decline. Half a century after his death, his work was dismissed as a &quot;parody of philosophy&quot;, and the historian Richard Hofstadter called him &quot;the metaphysician of the homemade intellectual, and the prophet of the cracker-barrel agnostic.&quot; Nonetheless, Spencer&#x27;s thought had penetrated so deeply into the Victorian age that his influence did not disappear entirely.

In recent years, much more positive estimates have appeared, as well as a still highly negative estimate.

===Political influence===
Despite his reputation as a social Darwinist, Spencer&#x27;s political thought has been open to multiple interpretations. His political philosophy could both provide inspiration to those who believed that individuals were masters of their fate, who should brook no interference from a meddling state, and those who believed that social development required a strong central authority. In &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot;, conservative justices of the United States Supreme Court could find inspiration in Spencer&#x27;s writings for striking down a New York law limiting the number of hours a baker could work during the week, on the ground that this law restricted liberty of contract. Arguing against the majority&#x27;s holding that a &quot;right to free contract&quot; is implicit in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote: &quot;The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer&#x27;s Social Statics.&quot; Spencer has also been described as a quasi-anarchist, as well as an outright anarchist. Marxist theorist Georgi Plekhanov, in his 1909 book &quot;Anarchism and Socialism&quot;, labelled Spencer a &quot;conservative Anarchist&quot;.

Spencer&#x27;s work has frequently been seen as a model for later libertarian thinkers, such as Robert Nozick, and he continues to be read – and is often invoked – by libertarians on issues concerning the function of government and the fundamental character of individual rights.

Spencer&#x27;s ideas also became very influential in China and Japan largely because he appealed to the reformers&#x27; desire to establish a strong nation-state with which to compete with the Western powers. His thought was introduced by the Chinese scholar Yen Fu, who saw his writings as a prescription for the reform of the Qing state. Spencerism was so influential in China that it was synthesized into the Chinese translation of the Origin of Species, in which Darwin&#x27;s branching view of evolution was converted into a linear-progressive one. Spencer also influenced the Japanese Westernizer Tokutomi Soho, who believed that Japan was on the verge of transitioning from a &quot;militant society&quot; to an &quot;industrial society&quot;, and needed to quickly jettison all things Japanese and take up Western ethics and learning. He also corresponded with Kaneko Kentaro, warning him of the dangers of imperialism. Savarkar writes, in his &quot;Inside the Enemy Camp&quot;, about reading all of Spencer&#x27;s works, of his great interest in them, of their translation into Marathi, and their influence on the likes of Tilak and Agarkar, and the affectionate sobriquet given to him in Maharashtra – Harbhat Pendse.

===Influence on literature===
Spencer greatly influenced literature and rhetoric. His 1852 essay, &quot;The Philosophy of Style&quot;, explored a growing trend of formalist approaches to writing. Highly focused on the proper placement and ordering of the parts of an English sentence, he created a guide for effective composition. Spencer aimed to free prose writing from as much &quot;friction and inertia&quot; as possible, so that the reader would not be slowed by strenuous deliberations concerning the proper context and meaning of a sentence. Spencer argued that writers should aim &quot;To so present ideas that they may be apprehended with the least possible mental effort&quot; by the reader.

He argued that by making the meaning as readily accessible as possible, the writer would achieve the greatest possible communicative efficiency. This was accomplished, according to Spencer, by placing all the subordinate clauses, objects and phrases before the subject of a sentence so that, when readers reached the subject, they had all the information they needed to completely perceive its significance. While the overall influence that &quot;The Philosophy of Style&quot; had on the field of rhetoric was not as far-reaching as his contribution to other fields, Spencer&#x27;s voice lent authoritative support to formalist views of rhetoric.

Spencer influenced literature inasmuch as many novelists and short story authors came to address his ideas in their work. Spencer was referenced by George Eliot, Leo Tolstoy, Machado de Assis, Thomas Hardy, Bolesław Prus, George Bernard Shaw, Abraham Cahan, Richard Austin Freeman, D. H. Lawrence, and Jorge Luis Borges. Arnold Bennett greatly praised &quot;First Principles&quot;, and the influence it had on Bennett may be seen in his many novels. Jack London went so far as to create a character, &quot;Martin Eden&quot;, a staunch Spencerian. It has also been suggested that the character of Vershinin in Anton Chekhov&#x27;s play &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; is a dedicated Spencerian. H. G. Wells used Spencer&#x27;s ideas as a theme in his novella, &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, employing them to explain the evolution of man into two species. It is perhaps the best testimony to the influence of Spencer&#x27;s beliefs and writings that his reach was so diverse. He influenced not only the administrators who shaped their societies&#x27; inner workings, but also the artists who helped shape those societies&#x27; ideals and beliefs. In Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s novel &quot;Kim&quot;, the Anglophile Bengali spy Hurree Babu admires Herbert Spencer and quotes him to comic effect: &quot;They are, of course, dematerialised phenomena. Spencer says.&quot; &quot;I am good enough Herbert Spencerian, I trust, to meet little thing like death, which is all in my fate, you know.&quot; &quot;He thanked all the Gods of Hindustan, and Herbert Spencer, that there remained some valuables to steal.&quot; Upton Sinclair, in &quot;One Clear Call&quot;, 1948, quips that &quot;Huxley said that Herbert Spencer&#x27;s idea of a tragedy was a generalization killed by a fact; ...&quot;

<text>A theodolite () is a precision optical instrument for measuring angles between designated visible points in the horizontal and vertical planes. The traditional use has been for land surveying, but it is also used extensively for building and infrastructure construction, and some specialized applications such as meteorology and rocket launching.

It consists of a moveable telescope mounted so it can rotate around horizontal and vertical axes and provide angular readouts. These indicate the orientation of the telescope, and are used to relate the first point sighted through the telescope to subsequent sightings of other points from the same theodolite position. These angles can be measured with accuracies down to microradians or seconds of arc. From these readings a plan can be drawn, or objects can be positioned in accordance with an existing plan. The modern theodolite has evolved into what is known as a total station where angles and distances are measured electronically, and are read directly to computer memory.

In a &quot;transit theodolite&quot;, the telescope is short enough to rotate about the trunnion axis, turning the telescope through the vertical plane through the zenith; for non-transit instruments vertical rotation is restricted to a limited arc.

The optical level is sometimes mistaken for a theodolite, but it does not measure vertical angles, and is used only for leveling on a horizontal plane (though often combined with medium accuracy horizontal range and direction measurements).

== Principles of operation ==

===Preparation for making sightings===
Temporary adjustments are a set of operations necessary in order to make a theodolite ready for taking observations at a station. These include its setting up, centering, leveling up and elimination of parallax, and are achieved in four steps:

* Setting up: fixing the theodolite onto a tripod along with approximate leveling and centering over the station mark. 
* Centering: bringing the vertical axis of theodolite immediately over station mark using a centering plate also known as a tribrach.
* Leveling: leveling of the base of the instrument to make the vertical axis vertical usually with an in-built bubble-level.
* Focusing: removing parallax error by proper focusing of objective and eye-piece. The eye-piece only requires adjustment once at a station. The objective will be re-focused for each subsequent sighting from this station because of the different distances to the target.

===Sightings===
Sightings are taken by the surveyor, who adjusts the telescope&#x27;s vertical and horizontal angular orientation so the cross-hairs align with the desired sighting point. Both angles are read either from exposed or internal scales and recorded. The next object is then sighted and recorded without moving the position of the instrument and tripod.

The earliest angular readouts were from open vernier scales directly visible to the eye. Gradually these scales were enclosed for physical protection. scales were also used (not to be confused with the micrometre device used for length measurements). Finally, angle readings became an indirect optical readout, with convoluted light paths to bring them to a convenient place on the instrument for viewing. The modern digital theodolites have electronic displays.

=== Errors in measurement ===
; Index error: The angles in the vertical axis should read 90° (100 grad) when the sight axis is horizontal, or 270° (300 grad) when the instrument is transited. Half of the difference between the two positions is called the index error. This can only be checked on transit instruments.
; Horizontal axis error: The horizontal and vertical axes of a theodolite must be perpendicular; if not then a horizontal axis error exists. This can be tested by aligning the tubular spirit bubble parallel to a line between two footscrews and setting the bubble central. A horizontal axis error is present if the bubble runs off central when the tubular spirit bubble is reversed (turned through 180°). To adjust, the operator removes half the amount the bubble has run off using the adjusting screw, then re-level, test and refine the adjustment.
; Collimation error: The optical axis of the telescope must also be perpendicular to the horizontal axis; if not, then a collimation error exists.

Index error, horizontal-axis error (&quot;trunnion-axis error&quot;) and collimation error are regularly determined by calibration and are removed by mechanical adjustment. Their existence is taken into account in the choice of measurement procedure in order to eliminate their effect on the measurement results of the theodolite.

==History==
=== Historical background ===
Prior to the theodolite, instruments such as the groma, geometric square and the dioptra, and various other graduated circles (see circumferentor) and semicircles (see graphometer) were used to obtain either vertical or horizontal angle measurements. Over time their functions were combined into a single instrument that could measure both angles simultaneously.

The first occurrence of the word &quot;theodolite&quot; is found in the surveying textbook &quot;A geometric practice named Pantometria&quot; (1571) by Leonard Digges. The origin of the word is unknown. The first part of the Neo-Latin &quot;theo-delitus&quot; might stem from the Greek , &quot;to behold or look attentively upon&quot; The second part is often attributed to an unscholarly variation of the Greek word: , meaning &quot;evident&quot; or &quot;clear&quot;. Other Neo-Latin or Greek derivations have been suggested as well as an English origin from &quot;the alidade&quot;.

The early forerunners of the theodolite were sometimes azimuth instruments for measuring horizontal angles, while others had an altazimuth mount for measuring horizontal and vertical angles. Gregorius Reisch illustrated an altazimuth instrument in the appendix of his 1512 book &quot;Margarita Philosophica&quot;. Martin Waldseemüller, a topographer and cartographer made the device in that year calling it the &quot;polimetrum&quot;. In Digges&#x27;s book of 1571, the term &quot;theodolite&quot; was applied to an instrument for measuring horizontal angles only, but he also described an instrument that measured both altitude and azimuth which he called a &quot; instrument&quot; . Possibly the first instrument approximating to a true theodolite was the built by Josua Habemel in 1576, complete with compass and tripod. The 1728 &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; compares &quot;graphometer&quot; to &quot;half-theodolite&quot;. As late as the 19th century, the instrument for measuring horizontal angles only was called a &quot;simple theodolite&quot; and the altazimuth instrument, the &quot;plain theodolite&quot;.

The first instrument to combine the essential features of the modern theodolite was built in 1725 by Jonathan Sisson. This instrument had an altazimuth mount with a sighting telescope. The base plate had spirit levels, compass and adjusting screws. The circles were read with a vernier scale.

===Development of the theodolite===
The theodolite became a modern, accurate instrument in 1787, with the introduction of Jesse Ramsden&#x27;s famous great theodolite, which he created using a very accurate dividing engine of his own design. Ramsden&#x27;s instruments were used for the Principal Triangulation of Great Britain. At this time the highest precision instruments were made in England by such makers as Edward Troughton. Later the first practical German theodolites were made by Breithaupt together with Utzschneider, Reichenbach and Fraunhofer.

As technology progressed the vertical partial circle was replaced with a full circle, and both vertical and horizontal circles were finely graduated. This was the &quot;transit theodolite&quot;. This type of theodolite was developed from 18th century astronomical Transit instruments used to measure accurate star positions. The technology was transferred to theodolites in the early 19th century by instrument makers such as Edward Troughton and William Simms and became the standard theodolite design. Development of the theodolite was spurred on by specific needs. In the 1820s progress on national surveying projects such as the Ordnance Survey in Britain produced a requirement for theodolites capable of providing sufficient accuracy for large scale triangulation and mapping. The Survey of India at this time produced a requirement for more rugged and stable instruments such as the Everest pattern theodolite with its lower center of gravity.

Railway engineers working in the 1830s in Britain commonly referred to a theodolite as a &quot;Transit&quot;. The 1840s was the start of a period of rapid railway building in many parts of the world which resulted in a high demand for theodolites wherever railways were being constructed. It was also popular with American railroad engineers pushing west, and it replaced the railroad compass, sextant and octant. Theodolites were later adapted to a wider variety of mountings and uses. In the 1870s, an interesting waterborne version of the theodolite (using a pendulum device to counteract wave movement) was invented by Edward Samuel Ritchie. It was used by the U.S. Navy to take the first precision surveys of American harbors on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.

In the early 1920s a step change in theodolite design occurred with the introduction of the Wild T2 made by the Swiss Wild Heerbrugg company. Heinrich Wild designed a theodolite with divided glass circles with readings from both sides presented at a single eyepiece close to the telescope so the observer did not have to move to read them. The Wild instruments were not only smaller, easier to use and more accurate than contemporary rivals but also sealed from rain and dust. Canadian surveyors reported that while the Wild T2 with 3.75 inch circles was not able to provide the accuracy for primary triangulation it was the equal in accuracy to a 12 inch traditional design. The Wild T2, T3, and A1 instruments were made for many years.

In 1926 a conference was held at Tavistock in Devon, UK where Wild theodolites were compared with British ones. The Wild product outclassed the British theodolites so manufacturers such as Cooke, Troughton &amp; Simms and Hilger &amp; Watts set about improving the accuracy of their products to match their competition. Cooke, Troughton and Simms developed the Tavistock pattern theodolite and later the Vickers V. 22.

Wild went on to develop the DK1, DKM1, DM2, DKM2, and DKM3 for Kern Aarau company. With continuing refinements, instruments steadily evolved into the modern theodolite used by surveyors today. By 1977 Wild, Kern and Hewlett-Packard were all offering &quot;Total stations&quot; which combined angular measurements, electronic distance measurement and microchip functions in a single unit.

=== Operation in surveying ===

Triangulation, as invented by Gemma Frisius around 1533, consists of making such direction plots of the surrounding landscape from two separate standpoints. The two graphing papers are superimposed, providing a scale model of the landscape, or rather the targets in it. The true scale can be obtained by measuring one distance both in the real terrain and in the graphical representation.

Modern triangulation as, e.g., practiced by Snellius, is the same procedure executed by numerical means. Photogrammetric block adjustment of stereo pairs of aerial photographs is a modern, three-dimensional variant.

In the late 1780s, Jesse Ramsden, a Yorkshireman from Halifax, England who had developed the dividing engine for dividing angular scales accurately to within a second of arc (≈ 0.0048 mrad or 4.8 μrad), was commissioned to build a new instrument for the British Ordnance Survey. The Ramsden theodolite was used over the next few years to map the whole of southern Britain by triangulation.

In network measurement, the use of forced centering speeds up operations while maintaining the highest precision. The theodolite or the target can be rapidly removed from, or socketed into, the forced centering plate with sub-millimeter precision. Nowadays GPS antennas used for geodetic positioning use a similar mounting system. The height of the reference point of the theodolite—or the target—above the ground benchmark must be measured precisely.

===Transit theodolite===
The term transit theodolite, or transit for short, refers to a type of theodolite where the telescope is short enough to rotate in a full circle on its horizontal axis as well as around its vertical axis. It features a vertical circle which is graduated through the full 360 degrees and a telescope that could &quot;flip over&quot; (&quot;transit the scope&quot;). By reversing the telescope and at the same time rotating the instrument through 180 degrees about the vertical axis, the instrument can be used in &#x27;plate-left&#x27; or &#x27;plate-right&#x27; modes (&#x27;plate&#x27; refers to the vertical protractor circle). By measuring the same horizontal and vertical angles in these two modes and then averaging the results, centering and collimating errors in the instrument can be eliminated. Some transit instruments are capable of reading angles directly to thirty arc-seconds (≈ 0.15 mrad). Modern theodolites are usually of the transit-theodolite design, but engraved plates have been replaced with glass plates designed to be read with light-emitting diodes and computer circuitry, greatly improving accuracy up to arc-second (≈ 0.005 mrad) levels.

== Use with weather balloons ==
There is a long history of theodolite use in measuring winds aloft, by using specially-manufactured theodolites to track the horizontal and vertical angles of special weather balloons called &quot;ceiling balloons&quot; or &quot;pilot balloons&quot; (&quot;pibal&quot;). Early attempts at this were made in the opening years of the nineteenth century, but the instruments and procedures weren&#x27;t fully developed until a hundred years later. This method was extensively used in World War II and thereafter, and was gradually replaced by radio and GPS measuring systems from the 1980s onward.

The pibal theodolite uses a prism to bend the optical path by 90 degrees so the operator&#x27;s eye position does not change as the elevation is changed through a complete 180 degrees. The theodolite is typically mounted on a rugged steel stand, set up so it is level and pointed north, with the altitude and azimuth scales reading zero degrees. A balloon is released in front of the theodolite, and its position is precisely tracked, usually once a minute. The balloons are carefully constructed and filled, so their rate of ascent can be known fairly accurately in advance. Mathematical calculations on time, rate of ascent, azimuth and angular altitude can produce good estimates of wind speed and direction at various altitudes.
== Modern electronic theodolites ==
In modern electronic theodolites, the readout of the horizontal and vertical circles is usually done with a rotary encoder. These produce signals indicating the altitude and azimuth of the telescope which are fed to a microprocessor. CCD sensors have been added to the focal plane of the telescope allowing both auto-targeting and the automated measurement of residual target offset. All this is implemented in embedded software of the processor.

Many modern theodolites are equipped with integrated electro-optical distance measuring devices, generally infrared based, allowing the measurement in one step of complete three-dimensional vectors—albeit in instrument-defined polar coordinates, which can then be transformed to a preexisting coordinate system in the area by means of a sufficient number of control points. This technique is called a resection solution or free station position surveying and is widely used in mapping surveying.

Such instruments are &quot;intelligent&quot; theodolites called self-registering tacheometers or colloquially &quot;total stations&quot;, and perform all the necessary angular and distance calculations, and the results or raw data can be downloaded to external processors, such as ruggedized laptops, PDAs or programmable calculators.

== Gyrotheodolites ==
A gyrotheodolite is used when the north-south reference bearing of the meridian is required in the absence of astronomical star sights. This occurs mainly in the underground mining industry and in tunnel engineering. For example, where a conduit must pass under a river, a vertical shaft on each side of the river might be connected by a horizontal tunnel. A gyrotheodolite can be operated at the surface and then again at the foot of the shafts to identify the directions needed to tunnel between the base of the two shafts. Unlike an artificial horizon or inertial navigation system, a gyrotheodolite cannot be relocated while it is operating. It must be restarted again at each site.

The gyrotheodolite comprises a normal theodolite with an attachment that contains a gyrocompass, a device which senses the rotation of the Earth in order to find true north and thus, in conjunction with the direction of gravity, the plane of the meridian. The meridian is the plane that contains both the axis of the Earth&#x27;s rotation and the observer. The intersection of the meridian plane with the horizontal defines the true north-south direction found in this way. Unlike magnetic compasses, gyrocompasses are able to find &quot;true&quot; north, the surface direction toward the north pole.

A gyrotheodolite will function at the equator and in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The meridian is undefined at the geographic poles. A gyrotheodolite cannot be used at the poles where the Earth&#x27;s axis is precisely perpendicular to the horizontal axis of the spinner, indeed it is not normally used within about 15 degrees of the pole where the angle between the earth&#x27;s rotation and the direction of gravity is too small for it to work reliably. When available, astronomical star sights are able to give the meridian bearing to better than one hundred times the accuracy of the gyrotheodolite. Where this extra precision is not required, the gyrotheodolite is able to produce a result quickly without the need for night observations.

<doc id="248863" wikidata="Q5183141" url="?curid=248863" title="Crazy Eddie">
<text>Crazy Eddie was a consumer electronics chain in the Northeastern United States. The chain was started in 1969 in New York, New York, by businessmen Eddie and Sam M. Antar, and was previously named ERS Electronics (ERS stood for Eddie, Rose and Sam; Rose and Sam were Eddie&#x27;s parents). The chain rose to prominence throughout the Tri-State area (New York-New Jersey-Connecticut) as much for its prices as for its memorable radio and television commercials, featuring a frenetic, &quot;crazy&quot; character played by radio DJ Jerry Carroll (who copied most of his shtick from early TV commercial pioneer, used car and electronics salesman Earl &quot;Madman&quot; Muntz). At its peak, Crazy Eddie had 43 stores in four states and reported more than $300 million in sales.

Almost from the beginning, Crazy Eddie engaged in fraudulent business practices, including under-reporting income, skimming sales taxes, and paying employees off the books. These practices, in conjunction with aggressive sales tactics, enabled Crazy Eddie to significantly undercut competitors and grow rapidly. During the process of going public, Crazy Eddie continued to engage in fraud, over-reporting profits, inflating inventory and duping auditors. Unable to sustain his fraudulent business practices, co-founder Eddie Antar cashed in millions of dollars&#x27; worth of stock and resigned from the company in December 1986. Crazy Eddie&#x27;s board of directors approved the sale of the company in November 1987. The entire Antar family was immediately removed from the business. The new owners quickly discovered the true extent of the Antar family&#x27;s fraud, but were unable to turn around Crazy Eddie&#x27;s quickly declining fortunes. In 1989, the company filed for bankruptcy and was liquidated.

In February 1987, the United States Attorney&#x27;s Office for the District of New Jersey commenced a federal grand jury investigation into the financial activities of Crazy Eddie. In September of that year, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission initiated an investigation into alleged violations of federal securities laws by certain Crazy Eddie officers and employees. Eddie Antar was eventually charged with a series of crimes. Antar fled to Israel in February 1990, but was returned to the United States in January 1993 to stand trial. His 1993 conviction on fraud charges was overturned, but he eventually pleaded guilty in 1996. In 1997, Antar was sentenced to eight years in prison and was subject to numerous fines. He was released from prison in 1999, and died in 2016.

==Beginnings==
Eddie Antar (December 18, 1947 - September 10, 2016) was born in Brooklyn, New York City to a family of Syrian Jewish origin. His grandparents, Murad and Tera Antar, moved to Brooklyn from Aleppo, Syria. Murad and Tera worked in their market stalls alongside Arabs, including Egyptians, other Syrians, as well as Turks. Eddie&#x27;s father Sam Antar was a retailer, and it was no surprise to the family that Eddie also became a retailer.

The predecessor to Crazy Eddie was a consumer electronics shop called Sight And Sound. It was a property of ERS Electronics, a company owned by Sam M. Antar, his son Eddie Antar, and Eddie&#x27;s cousin Ronnie Gindi. Sight And Sound, located on Kings Highway in Brooklyn, began operation in 1969 and offered electronics at regular prices. Due to his aggressive sales techniques, Eddie quickly became known as &quot;Crazy Eddie&quot;, but within eighteen months the shop (as well as Eddie and Ronnie) was nearly bankrupt. Eddie bought out Gindi&#x27;s one-third ownership stake of Sight And Sound, and Sam M. Antar retained his one-third stake but left the day-to-day operations to Eddie. In 1971, the Sight And Sound store on Kings Highway was renamed Crazy Eddie. Eddie continued his sales tactics with the renamed Crazy Eddie shop, but this time was successful. Eventually, Eddie closed that location and relocated the business to a bigger shop, just a few blocks from Sight And Sound&#x27;s old location. In 1973, Antar opened the second Crazy Eddie location in Syosset, New York. A third followed during 1975, located in Greenwich Village. That year, Antar established a corporate main office on Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn. By 1977, two more stores had been opened, with one located on East Fordham Road in The Bronx and the other being the first Crazy Eddie location in New Jersey, located on the southbound side of Route 17 in Paramus. By 1981, Crazy Eddie was operating ten locations, one of which was a new flagship location located on East 57th Street on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side.

==Advertising==

Crazy Eddie stores were famous in the New York metro area for their advertisements, which featured Jerry Carroll as the star. The relationship between the two sides began in 1972, when Carroll was a radio disc jockey known as &quot;Dr. Jerry&quot; at WPIX-FM. Antar had paid for an on-air ad and Carroll read the chain&#x27;s slogan &quot;his prices are insane&quot; in an exaggerated and frenetic manner. When Antar heard Carroll&#x27;s delivery, he telephoned the radio station and told Carroll to say the line the same way every time he read it.

In 1975, Carroll began appearing in television commercials for Crazy Eddie. For most of the next fifteen years Carroll performed commercials in the same frenetic manner he had for radio. One of his more memorable promotions was for Crazy Eddie&#x27;s annual &quot;Christmas in August&quot; sale, where he would dress in a Santa suit and do the commercial while stagehands threw fake snowballs at him. Carroll also had a trademark look in each commercial, wearing a blue suit with a lighter blue turtleneck shirt in almost all of his appearances (even during later years). Carroll even appeared in a Spanish-language Crazy Eddie advertisement, although he did not have a speaking role; instead, his appearance consisted of him holding a radio to his ear as he walked behind the commercial&#x27;s spokesman, stopping only to wave at the camera several times.

During the 1980s, more than 7,500 unique radio and television ads were broadcast in the tri-state area. Carroll&#x27;s acting became so identified with the company that many people thought he was actually Crazy Eddie; Crazy Eddie even made a commercial to this effect with Carroll as a Superman-styled superhero named Crazy Eddie. Warner Communications, the parent company of the distributor of the &quot;Superman&quot; movie series, found the commercial to be problematic and sued the chain trying to stop it. At the time, Warner also was the parent company of the Atari video game company, and its largest customer for systems and games was Crazy Eddie. Therefore, in retaliation for the lawsuit, Eddie said that if Warner was going to sue for the commercial, he would stop selling Atari products in his stores. The suit was eventually settled.

The commercials were so memorable that HBO&#x27;s news parody series &quot;Not Necessarily the News&quot; created a parody television commercial featuring a caricature of Oliver North (from the infamous Iran–Contra affair), known as &quot;Crazy Ollie&quot;, selling used weapons at bargain prices. An early Eddie&#x27;s commercial parody appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on January 22, 1977, in the Dan Aykroyd creation, &quot;Crazy Ernie&quot;. Carroll and the commercials attained further cultural significance during the 1980s, with the commercials sometimes appearing in the background of contemporary motion pictures. An example is the frightening first sight of a television receiver with a typical Jerry Carroll commercial on screen by Daryl Hannah&#x27;s mermaid character in Ron Howard&#x27;s 1984 comedy &quot;Splash&quot;.

Carroll&#x27;s presence was ubiquitous enough that 
the makers of Yoplait yogurt signed him to do a commercial for their product in 1985. Playing up his character and the Crazy Eddie chain, he was dressed in his usual blue sport coat and light blue turtleneck shirt and standing among racks of electronic equipment while sampling the company&#x27;s product and then singing its praises in French.

Crazy Eddie also was known to have in-store appearances by notable rock acts, including all four members of Queen in their Manhattan location on Tuesday, July 27, 1982 (prior to their performance that evening at Madison Square Garden).

==Fraud==
Almost from the beginning, Crazy Eddie&#x27;s management engaged in various forms of fraud. The Antars deliberately falsified their books to reduce (or eliminate) their taxable income. They also paid employees off the books, and regularly skimmed thousands of dollars (in cash) earned at the shops. For every $5 Crazy Eddie reported as income, $1 was taken by the Antars. In 1979, the Antars began depositing much of this money—hundreds of thousands of dollars—in Israeli bank accounts. The Antar family skimmed an estimated $3 to $4 million per year at the height of their fraud. In one offshore bank account, the family deposited more than $6 million between 1980 and 1983.

By 1983, it was becoming more and more difficult to hide the millions of illicit dollars. The Antars decided that the way to cover up their growing fraud was to take the company public. In preparation, Eddie initiated a scheme in 1979 to skim less each year. Since more income was actually being reported, this had the effect of showing drastically increasing profit margins. While the company&#x27;s actual profits (taking into account skimmed profits) from 1980 to 1983 increased approximately 13%, reported profits increased nearly 171%.

Despite the misgivings of people closely associated with Crazy Eddie, the company held its initial public offering on September 13, 1984 (former symbol: CRZY). Shares of the company sold initially for $8. By early 1986, Crazy Eddie stock was trading at more than $75 per share.

Eddie recruited his cousin, Sam E. Antar (known as Sammy, and not to be confused with Sam A. Antar, the BetMGM litigant), to assist the company with its fraud. Sammy earned a degree in accounting in 1980, and served his apprenticeship with Penn and Horowitz, Crazy Eddie&#x27;s auditor. In 1986, he was named chief financial officer of the company. Sammy was informed that there was a $3 million deficit from the previous year&#x27;s inventory fraud that needed to be hidden. Additionally, he was instructed to find ways to show a 10% growth in sales. One of Sammy&#x27;s major schemes was a money laundering operation later known as the Panama Pump—money that the Antars had deposited in Israeli banks was transferred to bank accounts in Panama. These accounts, opened using false names, then drafted payments to Crazy Eddie. This money was largely used to inflate same-store sales totals for the company.

As a public company, Eddie, Sammy, and others engaged in increasing amounts of inventory fraud to increase reported profits and inflate the value of Crazy Eddie stock. For the fiscal year ended March 1, 1985, Crazy Eddie falsified inventories by $3 million. The next fiscal year, that amount increased to between $10 and $12 million.

===Eventual downfall===
Only months after Crazy Eddie&#x27;s IPO, Antar&#x27;s marriage to his wife, Debbie, became unstable as a result of frequent arguments. He then commenced an affair with another, younger woman, also named Debbie. The trysting pair were caught by Eddie&#x27;s wife and sister on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1984. Crazy Eddie&#x27;s troubles began almost immediately afterward; the scam had relied extensively on family members helping keep the appearance that it was an immensely successful company.

By 1987, Sammy Antar&#x27;s goal was no longer to show greater profitability, but rather to disguise previous frauds. During fiscal year 1987, they falsified inventories between $22.5 and $28 million. In addition, Crazy Eddie booked $20 million in phony debit memos or charge backs to vendors that reduced accounts payable.

As the company&#x27;s fraud became more difficult to disguise, the public perception of Crazy Eddie as a commercial success began to change. By October 1986, the company&#x27;s stock value had decreased to $17.50 per share. During December, Eddie announced his resignation as president and CEO. In April 1987, it was announced that Eddie had in fact retained his role as president but had dismissed, among others, his father Sam M. Antar. But by then Eddie Antar had already cashed out his share of Crazy Eddie stock, worth between $25 million and $30 million.

By the spring of 1987, the company&#x27;s stock cost less than $10 a share. Additionally, earnings decreased 20% from the previous year. The franchise did show a 34% sales increase, but this was mainly the result of 13 new store openings. In May 1987, Eddie began proceedings to make the company a privately held company again, seeking out Canadian investment banker Samuel Belzberg as a partner.

As this was going on, another electronics discounter entered the picture and started buying up shares in Crazy Eddie. This man was Elias Zinn, who was based in Houston and was running his own business across Texas. Zinn eventually partnered with management consultant Victor Palmieri&#x27;s backing to purchase $17.5 million worth of Crazy Eddie stock, which represented 7.5% of the outstanding shares. This eventually resulted in Zinn and Palmieri ending up with the controlling interest in the company, which enabled them to initiate a hostile takeover.

Once rumors of a takeover started, financial analysts began to examine more closely Crazy Eddie&#x27;s financial situation. What they discovered was that while most stockholders of the company had lost money since 1984, Eddie had sold 6.5 million shares worth $74 million (~$ in ). A flurry of stockholder lawsuits were filed against the Antar family.

Eddie and Sammy Antar briefly attempted to counter-offer Zinn&#x27;s takeover, but Zinn quickly topped their funds. The Antars&#x27; bid was ended, and Zinn became the new owner of Crazy Eddie on November 6, 1987. He immediately dismissed the rest of the Antar family from any important jobs. When Palmieri&#x27;s financial analysts completed their preliminary audit a few weeks after the takeover, they estimated that Crazy Eddie&#x27;s inventory was short by $40 to $50 million. The final figure was $80 million.

By June 1988, Crazy Eddie&#x27;s suppliers were demanding the liquidation of the company, so they could recover money owed to them; in 1989 they got their wish. The closing of Crazy Eddie began in March 1989, as the company shuttered 17 of its 43 stores. On June 6, 1989, Crazy Eddie was served with a petition by five of its creditors, who had not been paid a total of $860,000 they were owed, which sought to have the company forced into bankruptcy. The company originally planned to fight the petition and file for dismissal, but 15 days later Crazy Eddie voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Company president and CEO Peter Martosella cited problems created by the creditors&#x27; position (which he termed &quot;ill-advised&quot;), but said business would be conducted as usual at the remaining 26 stores and that Crazy Eddie was still a strong franchise. The company vowed to stay in business, but, despite Martosella&#x27;s assertions, Crazy Eddie continued to falter. By the autumn of 1989, the chain was down to eighteen remaining locations and sales were continuing to decrease and stores were unable to keep items stocked due to lack of supplier interest in the company.

Finally, on October 2, 1989, Crazy Eddie&#x27;s bankruptcy was converted from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7, and the company began a total liquidation immediately thereafter. By the end of November 1989, the last eighteen Crazy Eddie stores were shuttered and the chain, which only five years earlier had been one of the more lucrative retail chains in the United States, had ceased to exist.

===Legal battles===
In the meantime, a longtime Crazy Eddie associate named Arnie Spindler, who quit the company after Eddie dismissed his father Sam, brothers Allen and Mitchell and others after a family dispute, had provided investigators with information concerning Crazy Eddie&#x27;s fraudulent business practices. Spindler implicated Eddie and Sammy, but stated the rest of the family was innocent, though subpoenas were served to the entire Antar family.

Based on information gathered during its investigation, the SEC charged Eddie Antar with securities fraud and illegal insider trading on September 6, 1989. In January 1990, a Federal district judge ordered Antar to repatriate more than $50 million (~$ in ) he had transferred illegally to Israel. He was also ordered to appear in court to explain what had happened with the money. When he failed to appear, an arrest warrant was issued. Eddie surrendered to U.S. Marshals a week later, but was released and ordered to appear at a second hearing. When he failed to appear at that hearing, a second arrest warrant was issued and his assets were frozen.

Eddie fled to Israel using a forged Brazilian passport and the alias David Jacob Levi Cohen, and purchased a townhouse in the city of Yavne. After Eddie fled the country, Sammy offered to testify for Federal prosecutors in exchange for immunity. Sammy pleaded guilty to three felonies. He avoided jail time in exchange for his testimony, however, and was instead sentenced to six months of house arrest, 1,200 hours of community service, three years of probation, and was levied more than $10,000 in fines. As of 2009, Sammy was an adviser for government agencies and businesses investigating fraud.

Eddie was indicted on federal racketeering conspiracy charges. He was located by the FBI and Israel Police after his transfers of money from the United States through a Swiss bank were traced, and in June 1992 was arrested by Israeli police for extradition to the United States. While in custody, he attempted to commit suicide by swallowing a bottle of pills. After a six-month legal battle against extradition, he returned to face trial in the United States in January 1993 after his lawyers negotiated a deal with the United States Department of Justice in which he would only be tried for offenses committed prior to 1988, ensuring that he would not be charged with fleeing the country and possessing forged documents. Antar pleaded not guilty. His trial began in June 1993, and was prosecuted jointly by U.S. Attorneys Paul Weissman and Michael Chertoff. On July 20, Eddie was found guilty of seventeen counts of fraud. His brother, Mitchell, was found guilty of three counts, and acquitted on two. Eddie was sentenced to years in prison. The Antars&#x27; lawyers immediately filed an appeal, which succeeded in April 1995 when a federal appeals panel agreed with their contention that the judge presiding over their trial was biased against their clients. Chertoff, calling Eddie &quot;the Darth Vader of capitalism&quot;, vowed to begin a new trial.

Eddie Antar eventually pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges in May 1996. In February 1997, he was sentenced to eight years in prison. He was also ordered to pay more than $150 million in fines, in addition to the more than $1 billion in judgments against him resulting from various civil suits. Efforts to recover additional money from the Antar family on behalf of defrauded stockholders were completed in 2012.

==Aftermath==
Soon after the chain closed in 1989, a New Jersey–based investment group led by Alex Adjmi bought the rights to the Crazy Eddie trademark and announced in January 1990 that it had purchased the leases on Crazy Eddie&#x27;s original location in Brooklyn and another in East Brunswick, New Jersey. The intent of the Adjmi group was to reopen the chain, but nothing ever came of the attempt.

In 1998, the grandchildren of Eddie, Allen and Mitchell Antar, revived the chain with a shop in Wayne, New Jersey, and as an online Internet venture, crazyeddieonline.com. The revived company retained the slogan &quot;His prices are insane&quot; and re-hired Jerry Carroll, who by this time had founded his own advertising agency, as spokesman. Despite plans to expand the chain to a potential 10 stores, the new Crazy Eddie did not expand beyond the Wayne store and in 1999 the only shop of the revived chain closed.

Eddie returned to the company in 2001, which by this time had been doing business solely as an Internet and buy-by-telephone business for more than a year. He reinitiated the Web site as crazyeddie.com and once again hired Jerry Carroll to do its advertising. By 2004, crazyeddie.com had disappeared again, and after a brief attempt to revive the online retailer in 2005, Crazy Eddie ceased to exist once again. The Crazy Eddie trademark and associated intellectual property were then acquired by Texas-based company Trident Growth Fund. In July 2006, Trident attempted to auction the brand and the domain name crazyeddie.com on eBay, but the reserve price was not met.

On March 3, 2009, it was announced that Brooklyn-based businessman Jack Gemal had bought the rights to the Crazy Eddie name and quickly began a new online Crazy Eddie venture at pricesareinsane.com. Gemal was also reported to be scouting retail space for new Crazy Eddie retail locations, stating that he wanted to open 50 locations during the next two years. This online venture performed business in the same manner as Crazy Eddie&#x27;s other online stores, selling appliances and other electronics through the Internet. However, Gemal was never able to find the retail space he sought to reinitiate the Crazy Eddie store chain, and in 2012, the online business ended. The pricesareinsane.com site no longer exists, and as of 2018, the Crazy Eddie trademark is listed as abandoned.

Jerry Carroll died in October 2020 after suffering from cardiac issues for many years. Writer Gary Weiss, in doing research for a book he was writing about the rise and fall of Crazy Eddie, learned that Carroll&#x27;s death had not been publicized, despite how ubiquitous a presence he was while serving as spokesman for Crazy Eddie.

===Death of Eddie Antar===
On September 10, 2016, Eddie Antar died at the age of 68. A funeral home in Ocean Township, New Jersey confirmed the death. Although Antar had been suffering from liver cancer, an official cause was not given. CNBC Commentator and journalist Herb Greenberg remarked that Antar&#x27;s death was the &quot;end of an era&quot;.

==2022 book==
On August 23, 2022, a book detailing the rise and fall of Crazy Eddie was released. Titled &quot;Retail Gangster&quot; and written by journalist Gary Weiss, the book chronicles, in significant detail, how Eddie Antar was able to build his business into one of the most profitable in the country and the illicit means he employed.

==Legacy==

A Crazy Eddie store briefly appears in episode 3 of the Marvel Studios animated series &quot;X-Men &#x27;97&quot;.

A Crazy Eddie store employee appears in &quot;Russian Doll&quot; season 2.

In the 2016 film &quot;The Accountant&quot;, Ben Affleck&#x27;s character references Crazy Eddie Antar and the Panama Pump when describing an ongoing embezzlement case. A tax evasion scheme that Affleck&#x27;s character is investigating is similar to one of Crazy Eddie&#x27;s embezzlement operations.

The &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Insane in the Mainframe&quot; references Crazy Eddie with the character of Malfunctioning Eddie.

The 1986 animated film &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot; references Crazy Eddie with Crazy Ernie.

<text>The United States Grand Prix is a motor racing event that has been held on and off since 1908, when it was known as the American Grand Prize. The Grand Prix later became part of the Formula One World Championship. , the Grand Prix has been held 53 times at ten different locations. Since 2012, it has been held every year at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas, except in 2020 when it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==History==

===Beginnings and the Vanderbilt Cup===
Inspired by the Gordon Bennett Cup and Circuit des Ardennes races he had competed in, William Kissam Vanderbilt II founded a series of road races in the United States to showcase American road racing to the world. The Vanderbilt Cup soon became an institution on New York&#x27;s Long Island, attracting American and European competitors alike. However, the race was plagued by crowd control problems, which led to spectator deaths and injuries, and the cancellation of the 1907 event. Upon its return for 1908, the American Automobile Association did not adopt the new Grand Prix regulations agreed upon by the &quot;Association Internationale des Automobiles Clubs Reconnus&quot; (AIACR). This led the rival Automobile Club of America, an enthusiasts group with strong ties to Europe, to sponsor the &quot;American Grand Prize&quot;, using the Grand Prix rules. The Savannah Automobile Club of Savannah, Georgia, which had staged two days of successful stock car races on March 18 and 19, 1908, won the rights to stage the event.

===The Grand Prize era===
The Savannah Automobile Club laid out a lengthened version of their stock car course, totaling . Georgia Governor M. Hoke Smith authorized the use of convict labor to construct the circuit of oiled gravel. The Governor also sent state militia troops to augment local police patrols in keeping the crowd in check, hoping to avoid the pitfalls of the Vanderbilt Cup races. The entry for the inaugural race featured 14 European and six American entries, including factory teams from Benz, Fiat, and Renault. In the race, held on Thanksgiving Day, Ralph DePalma led early in his Fiat, before falling back with lubrication and tire problems. The race came down to a three-way battle between the Benz of Victor Hémery and the Fiats of Louis Wagner and Felice Nazzaro. Wagner won the race by the close margin of 56 seconds.

Despite the success of the Savannah event, it was decided that the 1909 race would be held on Long Island, in conjunction with the Vanderbilt Cup. However, only the Vanderbilt race was held and the Grand Prize pushed back to the next year. After the 1910 Vanderbilt Cup saw more issues, including the deaths of two riding mechanics and several serious spectator injuries, the Grand Prize was cancelled once again. A last-minute request by the Savannah club saved the race for the year, but only gave one month to prepare the course. A shorter course was laid out, but due to the short notice, most European teams were not able to make the trip. The leading trio from 1908 did make it and American David Bruce-Brown joined the Benz squad. Bruce-Brown won another incredibly tight race over teammate Hémery, this time by only 1.42 seconds. The 1911 event returned to Savannah, and this time the Vanderbilt Cup came with it; the Cup and Grand Prize were to be held together until 1916. Despite the success of the events, public pressure started to mount on the organizers. The use of convict labor and the militia drew criticism, as did the nuisance of closing roads for the event. Two accidents on the open roads in practice, one resulting in the death of Jay McNay, cast a shadow over the event. The American entries dominated the support events and ran well throughout the Grand Prize, after poor showings in past years and once again Bruce-Brown triumphed, this time driving a Fiat.

For 1912, Savannah succumbed to public pressure, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, won the bid for the race. A narrow, trapezoidal course was set up on the outskirts of the city, in Wauwatosa. As in 1911, tragedy struck in practice when David Bruce-Brown was killed after a puncture sent him off the road. On the final lap of the race, Ralph DePalma collided with eventual winner Caleb Bragg, seriously injuring DePalma and his mechanic and ending any chance of a second race at Milwaukee.

The Grand Prize was not held in 1913, after Long Island&#x27;s bid was rejected and Savannah refused to provide sufficient prize money. Oval racing on board tracks had taken off in the United States, to the detriment of road racing. For 1914, the Grand Prize and Vanderbilt Cup were staged in Santa Monica Road Race Course, near Los Angeles, on an course, with the start/finish straight along the Pacific Ocean. The field was primarily American entries (twelve, against five European entries), and the Americans dominated, with Eddie Pullen&#x27;s Mercer winning by over 40 seconds. In 1915, the race shifted to San Francisco, in conjunction with the Panama–Pacific International Exposition. With the outbreak of World War I in Europe, almost all of the drivers and cars were American, except for a few cars imported earlier. The course was set up around the Exposition grounds and nearby oval track with a boarded main straightaway. Heavy rain began two hours into the race, covering the circuit in mud from the extensive flower arrangements, and warping the main straight&#x27;s boards. Dario Resta in a Peugeot cruised to a seven-minute victory, and followed up a week later by winning the Vanderbilt Cup. For 1916, the Grand Prize returned to Santa Monica. The race would be a part of the AAA National Championship, which carried a 4.91-liter displacement limit. Although the limit for the Grand Prize was 7.37 liters, no large-displacement cars would enter. The race was the penultimate round of the championship, with Dario Resta leading Johnny Aitken after his Vanderbilt Cup win. However, both cars would be out before halfway. Although Aitken took over teammate Howdy Wilcox&#x27;s car for the win, the AAA awarded points only to Wilcox, and Resta took the championship.

===Post-WWI decline and the Indianapolis 500===
The Grand Prize was discontinued after the 1916 event. Between a lack of European participation due to World War I and the growing American interest in oval racing, road racing fell by the wayside. The two Santa Monica events were the only road races on the 1916 championship, and the aborted 1917 National Championship was slated to feature eight events, all ovals and six of them board tracks. The Vanderbilt Cup was revived in 1936 and 1937 and run to Grand Prix regulations; these races were run at the Roosevelt Park Autodrome near New York City but a lack of competition and domination by German Bernd Rosemeyer and Italian Tazio Nuvolari led to the races being a commercial failure.

The Indianapolis 500 kept a connection to European racing, running to Grand Prix regulations between 1923 and 1930, and from 1938 until 1953. In the late 1920s, efforts were made to refer to the 500 as the American Grand Prize. The Grand Prize trophy was awarded to the winner of the Indianapolis 500 between 1930 and 1936, when it was replaced by the Borg-Warner Trophy. The race was included in the World Championship from 1950 through 1960.

===Sebring (1959) and Riverside (1958, 1960)===
In 1957, Riverside International Raceway opened in Riverside, California, about east of Los Angeles. One of its first events was an SCCA National sports car race. For 1958, the race moved to the new, professional USAC Road Racing Championship, and was billed as the &quot;United States Grand Prix&quot;. The race attracted over 50 cars and drivers from sports car series in the US and Europe, as well as USAC and NASCAR. Chuck Daigh won in a Scarab, beating Dan Gurney&#x27;s Ferrari in second place.

Russian-born Alec Ulmann staged the first 12 Hours of Sebring endurance race in 1952 at the airport (converted from World War II use) of the rather isolated central Florida town of Sebring, located 1-1/2 hours south of Orlando and Tampa, and 3 hours north of Miami. The track was formed using service roads and runways of Sebring&#x27;s airport, and it became a round of the World Sportscar Championship in 1953. Buoyed by the success of the 12 Hours, the Riverside sports car race and Formula Libre events at Watkins Glen and Lime Rock Park, Ulmann decided to stage a Formula One race at Sebring International Raceway in 1959. The race was billed as the &quot;II United States Grand Prix&quot;, cementing the Riverside race as a part of the Grand Prix&#x27;s heritage. The race was originally scheduled for March 22, the day after the 12 Hour-race, but rescheduled for December 12, the final round of the season. The race took place 3 months after the previous round at Monza. The starting grid included seven American drivers, but New Zealand&#x27;s Bruce McLaren, in a Cooper, took his first win in F1 and was, at the time, the youngest driver ever to win a Grand Prix. McLaren took the lead on the last lap of the race when his team-mate, Jack Brabham, ran out of fuel. Brabham had to push his car over the line to finish fourth. By virtue of Ferrari&#x27;s Tony Brooks finishing third, Brabham and Cooper took the Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; championships, respectively. Despite providing an exciting climax to the season, the race was not successful from the hosts&#x27; standpoint, the race&#x27;s isolated location did not help the event&#x27;s success as the promoters barely broke even. When prize money checks bounced, Charles Moran and Briggs Cunningham paid the money to save face for their country.

Ulmann moved the race across the country to Riverside for 1960. Stirling Moss put on quite a show in his privately entered Lotus by winning from pole position. However, while the driver&#x27;s purse was enormous (as at Sebring), the event was no better received than the previous year&#x27;s due to a lack of promotion, and proximity to the successful Times Grand Prix. Again Moran and Cunningham would pay the prize money.

===Watkins Glen (1961–1980)===

==== 1960s ====
Through most of 1961, Ulmann was listed as the promoter of the USGP; he contacted organizers in Miami and Bill France of the Daytona International Speedway but was unable to reach agreements. In August, racing promoter Cameron Argetsinger, executive director of the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in the central Finger Lakes region of upstate New York, offered his circuit to the Automobile Competition Committee for the United States (ACCUS) to host the Grand Prix. The Watkins Glen circuit, which had hosted Formula Libre events, had similarities to the British Brands Hatch circuit: both had several banked corners and were sited in very green parts of the world. ACCUS accepted on August 28. Watkins Glen would host the United States Grand Prix for the next 20 years, longer than any other location before or since. It would receive the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association award for the best-organized and best-staged Grand Prix of the season in 1965, 1970, and 1971. The track would become known as the &quot;Mecca&quot; of American road racing and weave itself into European Grand Prix racing culture.

With just six weeks to organize the October 8 event, Argetsinger assembled the field, but was unable to convince Scuderia Ferrari to make the trip, leaving Richie Ginther and recently crowned World Champion Phil Hill out of their home Grand Prix. Innes Ireland took a surprise win, his first and the first for Team Lotus. Dan Gurney&#x27;s Porsche was second, and Tony Brooks, racing in his last Grand Prix, took third. Stirling Moss, in his own final Grand Prix, retired with engine problems. Unlike the previous two races, the race was well attended (over 60,000) and turned a profit. The race purse was paid in cash, a popular move with the teams after the previous two years&#x27; payment issues. 

1962 saw Briton Jim Clark win in a Lotus; the next three races were won by fellow-Briton Graham Hill, each time in a BRM. Hill&#x27;s 1964 win enabled him to carry a points advantage into the next and final race in Mexico. 1966 and 1967 saw Clark win; the &#x27;66 win was the only Formula One race he won that year, driving a Lotus with an overweight BRM H16 engine. Both the Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; championships were clinched at the event by Australian Jack Brabham and his Brabham team. In 1967, Clark dominated, leading comfortably from his teammate Hill and Denny Hulme in a Brabham. In 1968, Mario Andretti put his Lotus 49 on pole position in his first Formula One race. But Andretti retired, and Briton Jackie Stewart won the race in a Ford/Cosworth-powered Matra. Austrian Jochen Rindt won in 1969—his first Formula One race win. He took advantage of Stewart&#x27;s mechanical problems to pull a huge gap out on the rest of the field. Graham Hill had a much worse day. He punctured his car&#x27;s rear right tire and the rubber came off the rim. The rubber exploded, sending the Lotus cartwheeling off the course, and Hill was thrown out of the car, breaking both legs. 

Due to USGP&#x27;s position on the calendar near the end of the season, often either the final or penultimate round, championships were often decided before the event. In part to offset this, race organizers offered large sums of prize money; in 1969 the purse totaled $200,000 (with $50,000 for the winner), and when in 1972 it was raised to $275,000, the Tyrrell team earned a record $100,000. 

==== 1970s ====
1970 saw Brazilian newcomer Emerson Fittipaldi won the race in just his fourth Formula One start. Stewart retired his new Tyrrell and Fittipaldi, driving a Lotus, held off a charge from Mexican Pedro Rodriguez in a BRM. It was an emotional win for Colin Chapman&#x27;s Lotus team, as team leader Rindt had been killed while practicing for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Lotus had not run the Canadian Grand Prix, but because the next closest championship contender Jacky Ickx did not score enough points to keep him in contention, the Drivers&#x27; Championship was won by Rindt posthumously at this race. Team Lotus also won the Constructors&#x27; Championship at the 1970 event.
In 1971, the course was changed considerably. The entire lower section of the track was reconfigured, and a new section was constructed which added more than a mile to the course, lengthening it to . It also saw a new pitlane and pit straight and three new corners (a new first, second-to last and last corners). The improvements cost nearly $2.5 million ($13 million in 2010 dollars). The alterations considerably heightened the driving challenge of the track, and it became even more popular than it had been with drivers, teams and fans. Watkins Glen had been transformed from a quick, small circuit into a fast and very tough up-and-down circuit where just about every corner was banked and long; uncommonly hard driving and maximum effort was required for almost every part of a lap. 1971 was the first running on the completed full circuit (the circuit was not completed in time for previous races, so the completed short circuit was used) and it saw popular Frenchman François Cevert win his only Grand Prix for Tyrrell, and the biggest cash prize in Formula One: $267,000. 1972 saw Jackie Stewart win after Emerson Fittipaldi had already won the championship at the previous race, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Cevert made it a Tyrrell 1–2. At this point, the race was attracting many entries; 30 drivers entered and qualified for the 1972 race.

Jackie Stewart, unknown to almost everyone (including his wife Helen), had planned to retire after the 1973 race. He had already won his third Drivers&#x27; Championship two races previously at Monza and he would be running his 100th and final Grand Prix. But during qualifying, Stewart&#x27;s teammate and friend Cevert was killed. Going into the nearly flat out uphill Esses, Cevert lost control and struck the barrier on the left side nearly head on at . The car vaulted over the barriers and Cevert was killed instantly. The marshals left Cevert in the car and threw a cover over the cockpit. A distraught Stewart and his team&#x27;s manager Ken Tyrrell withdrew the team, handing the Constructors&#x27; Championship to Lotus. Stewart retired with immediate effect. In the race, Swede Ronnie Peterson in a Lotus beat Briton driver James Hunt in a Hesketh-entered March to the finish by 0.6 of a second. American Peter Revson finished fifth at his home race.

The 1974 event was to decide the world championship between Fittipaldi and Swiss Clay Regazzoni, who had the same number of points. Regazzoni, driving a Ferrari, ran into a host of problems during the race and finished out of the points. Fittipaldi finished fifth, which won him his second Drivers&#x27; Championship. The event was marred by yet another fatal accident. Austrian Helmut Koinigg crashed at the fast, long Outer Loop corner, the bend after the extended back straight on Lap 10. Koinigg&#x27;s Surtees went straight on and the car went under the barriers, killing him instantly. The race was a Brabham 1–2, with Argentine Carlos Reutemann winning with Brazilian Carlos Pace second. 1975 saw a medium-speed chicane added to the Esses to slow the cars down. The race was a politically charged event. Regazzoni held up Fittipaldi&#x27;s second-placed McLaren for six laps to try to help his teammate and leader of the race Niki Lauda get ahead; Fittipaldi eventually lapped the Swiss. However, Regazzoni was black-flagged by Clerk of the Course Berdie Martin, angering Ferrari team manager Luca di Montezemolo, who withdrew Regazzoni in protest. Their other driver, recently crowned Drivers&#x27; Champion Lauda, went on to win from Fittipaldi.

1976 saw James Hunt win in a McLaren while his closest championship contender Lauda finished third, putting Hunt just three points behind Lauda for the season&#x27;s final race at Fuji, Japan. The race also saw Jacky Ickx crash at the Chute; the Belgian survived but was injured. 1977 saw rain throughout the race. Hunt won again on a wet track as he held off home favorite Mario Andretti in a Lotus 78 to win by two seconds. The 1978 race took place two weeks after the death of Ronnie Peterson at Monza. Andretti had already accumulated enough points to win the Drivers&#x27; Championship before coming to Watkins Glen. Mechanical problems forced Andretti to retire early from the race, which was won by Carlos Reutemann in a Ferrari 312T3. 1979 saw Ferrari driver Gilles Villeneuve win a wet race after Australian Alan Jones retired after dominating much of the race.

By this time, Watkins Glen had begun to deteriorate. Drivers began complaining about the bumpy track surface, and the teams and press were concerned over facilities, the lackluster level of security and rowdy fans. Race attendees began to go to the so-called &quot;Bog&quot;, located inside the Boot, to set fire to objects and do other destructive things; cars and even a Greyhound bus in 1974 were burned there. Even though the Bog was made into a parking lot in 1975, things still did not improve sufficiently over the years. In 1978, the European motorsports governing body, FISA, demanded that the track owners make safety improvements to the track, which were made; and then the event was due to be cancelled for the 1980 season, but it was given a reprieve by FISA after promising to upgrade facilities over the winter. After initially being given an April 13 date on the calendar, the race was moved to October 5. Organizers were finally able to secure funding for circuit improvements in late August, and the track was resurfaced. But they still needed a $750,000 loan from the Formula One Constructors&#x27; Association (FOCA) to pay prize money and other expenses. Alan Jones won the 1980 race for Williams after he went off at the first corner on the first lap and charged through the field into second place from 17th, and he ended up taking the checkered flag after pole sitter Bruno Giacomelli retired with electrical problems near the Chute. Reutemann would make it a Williams 1–2, followed by Frenchman Didier Pironi in a Ligier. But this would prove to be the final United States Grand Prix at the Glen. It was initially included on the 1981 calendar, but cancelled after the debts could not be paid and government loans were denied.

===Phoenix (1989–1991)===

In addition to the United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, another race called the United States Grand Prix West in Long Beach, California, just outside Los Angeles, was first held in 1976. After Watkins Glen&#x27;s demise, other Formula One Grands Prix in the United States were briefly held on street circuits in Detroit and Dallas, and a car park in Las Vegas. The Detroit Grand Prix was the longest lasting, from 1982 to 1988; plans to continue Formula One races in Detroit at Belle Isle Park did not materialize, and in 1989, Formula One moved to the Sonoran Desert city of Phoenix, Arizona, bringing the United States Grand Prix name back for the first time since 1980. The Phoenix street circuit in the center of the city was unpopular with drivers and the event was largely ignored by the local populace. Phoenix, like many American cities, was designed on the grid system; the circuit was made up entirely of second-gear 90-degree corners and provided nearly no driving challenge or exciting corners to watch cars go around. The circuit was less bumpy and wider than Detroit, and its long straights made it easy to overtake and difficult to judge braking.

The inaugural event in 1989 was held at short notice and it could only be held in June (Detroit&#x27;s former date), one of the hottest months in Phoenix, a city with summer temperatures regularly exceeding . Temperatures neared on race weekend. Out of 40,000 capacity, 34,441 tickets were sold. Ecclestone expected the event to be sold out but was told that the local populace avoided outdoor events during summer. The race was moved to March, as the opening round of the season, for the next two years. The McLaren team dominated all three years, with Alain Prost winning in 1989 and Ayrton Senna in 1990 and 1991. The 1989 race saw Prost win his only Grand Prix in the United States by taking advantage of Senna&#x27;s engine electronics problems. The 1990 race saw emerging French star Jean Alesi harrying Senna for a number of laps; the Tyrrell driver went on to finish second behind Senna. The circuit had to be changed for the 1991 race due to the construction of a new Phoenix Suns basketball arena, and the revised circuit was generally seen to be an improvement. Senna won the race from pole position. On October 7, 1991, members of International Auto Sport Federation (FISA) met to discuss the agenda for the 1992 Formula One season, where they voted to cancel the contract with city of Phoenix. That same year, Phoenix assistant city manager David Garcia said the city had already invested $1.3 million dollars preparing for the 1992 race and was in negotiations with Ecclestone on contract cancellation. Ecclestone was asked if poor attendance was to blame for the Phoenix race pull out; he said that attendance was never a problem but the inability to place more than 20,000 seats in a way where fans could have a better view was. There were rumors of a race on the streets of the Manhattan borough of New York City for 1992 and a race on the streets of the Las Vegas Strip for 1995, but these never materialized and a Formula 1 event would not be held in United States for the next 9 years.

===Indianapolis (2000–2007) ===
It was not until 2000 that another United States Grand Prix took place, this time at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indiana. Indianapolis was rumored to have been considering a Formula One race since the USGP left Phoenix; with a proposed street race for the 1990 season in downtown Indianapolis. The infield road course uses about a mile of the oval, but in a clockwise direction. The crowd at the 2000 race was estimated at over 225,000, one of the largest ever in F1. Michael Schumacher&#x27;s win was his second of four straight to end the season as he overtook Mika Häkkinen for his third Championship. In 2001, the race took place less than three weeks after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US, and many teams and drivers featured special tributes to the USA on their cars and helmets and saw McLaren driver Häkkinen take his last Grand Prix win. The 2002 edition saw Schumacher and teammate Rubens Barrichello trading places near the finish line as Schumacher attempted to engineer a dead heat with Barrichello. 2003 saw a race held in mixed conditions race won by Michael Schumacher. Held in September in its first four years (in order to distance it from the &quot;500&quot; and NASCAR&#x27;s Brickyard 400), the USGP at Indianapolis was moved to an early summer date in 2004 in late June, 3 weeks after the Indy 500 so it could be paired with the Canadian Grand Prix and to make room for new Asian rounds. In 2005, problems with Michelin tires led to seven teams withdrawing from the race after the formation lap. Only the three teams (six cars) with Bridgestone tires started the race, and the event was considered a farce with Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher claiming a third consecutive win in the United States Grand Prix ahead of teammate Barrichello with Portuguese driver Tiago Monteiro claiming his only Formula One podium finish by finishing a lap down on winner Schumacher in third place for the Jordan team. Many commentators questioned whether a United States Grand Prix would be held in Indianapolis again, but the 2006 United States Grand Prix was held the next year, on July 2, 2006, without controversy with Schumacher winning the event for a fourth consecutive time and fifth time overall, ahead of his then-new Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa. Lewis Hamilton won the final US Grand Prix at Indianapolis in 2007.


On July 12, 2007, Formula One and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway announced that the 2007 US Grand Prix would be the last one held at IMS for the foreseeable future, as both sides could not agree on the terms for the event. It was thought that the race would return to Indianapolis for on the track configuration that was used for the 2008 race in the MotoGP championship. Then-Indianapolis Motor Speedway CEO, Tony George, claimed that the USGP would not return to Indianapolis unless it made financial sense. Due to the expensive fees paid to host a Grand Prix, the race would require a title sponsor to be economically viable. Ultimately, the United States Grand Prix was not on the Formula One calendar for 2009.

=== Austin (2012–2019, 2021–present)===

In August 2009, Formula One president Bernie Ecclestone remarked that there was no immediate plan to return Formula One to the United States, vowing &quot;never to return&quot; to Indianapolis. Nevertheless, shortly before the first race of the season, Ecclestone continued to fuel speculation that a return to Indianapolis was not out of the question.

Various efforts were made to try to bring the race to the New York City region. In March 2010, Ecclestone announced plans to bring a Formula One race to New York City for the season. Ecclestone was quoted as saying the race would take place across the Hudson River in New Jersey, with the Manhattan skyline overlooking the circuit. In May 2010, plans emerged for a circuit to be built in Jersey City&#x27;s Liberty State Park, but those plans were abandoned shortly thereafter. A race in West New York and Weehawken was later announced in October 2011. In May 2010, it was announced that Monticello Motor Club in upstate New York—a circuit complex modeled on a private country club near Monticello—had submitted a bid for the rights to host the race.

On May 25, 2010, Austin, Texas, was awarded the race on a ten-year contract, as Ecclestone and event promoter Full Throttle Productions agreed to a deal beginning in . The event is being held on a purpose-built new track, which was named Circuit of the Americas (COTA). German architect and track designer Hermann Tilke designed the new track on of land to the east of the city. In July 2010, promoter Tavo Hellmund promised that the circuit would be one of the &quot;most challenging and spectacular in the world&quot; and that it would include a selection of corner sequences inspired by &quot;the very best circuits&quot; in the world.

On November 15, 2011, it was reported that construction of the circuit had been temporarily halted as the owners had not yet been awarded the contract to stage the race in 2012, following reports that Bernie Ecclestone had cast doubt on the race taking place. After Tavo Hellmund&#x27;s contract was found in breach by Ecclestone and a new contract was entered into between Formula 1 and the original track investors, Red McCombs and Bobby Epstein, the US Grand Prix was confirmed to be held at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin on the original scheduled date in 2012. Reigning champion Sebastian Vettel took pole for the first race at the Texas circuit but it was 2007 winner Lewis Hamilton who kept his unbeaten run in the US as the two finished almost 40 seconds ahead of third.

On November 11, 2015, the Texas government cut nearly $6 million of the required $25 million in funding to host the event. Attendance numbers had dropped to 224,011 in October 2015, for the 2015 United States Grand Prix event, after heavy rain from a quickly dissipating Hurricane Patricia. On March 9, 2016, it was confirmed the race would continue to run in Austin, despite the funding cuts. 2016 turned out to be the best-attended Grand Prix in Austin: boosted by a heated World Drivers&#x27; Championship battle between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, good weather, and the allure of a Saturday night concert from pop singer Taylor Swift, nearly 270,000 people went through the turnstiles during the race weekend. On October 22, 2017, Lewis Hamilton won the race. Former US president Bill Clinton awarded the winning trophy. Justin Timberlake&#x27;s concert helped boost the Grand Prix attendance by 40,000 over the previous year. In 2018, Britney Spears and Bruno Mars performed.

The originally planned 2020 race at COTA was cancelled due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The race returned in 2021. COTA is due to host Formula One until 2026.

==Other Grands Prix in the United States==

The United States Grand Prix is the longest-running Formula One World Championship event held in the United States. Previously, however, there were four other separate F1 events there.

From until , the Long Beach circuit hosted a newly created United States Grand Prix West, which ran in the same seasons as the &quot;United States Grand Prix (East)&quot;. The United States was thus the first nation since Italy in to hold two Formula One Grands Prix in the same season. During the years – when both Grands Prix ran, the &quot;United States Grand Prix&quot; was also referred to as the &quot;United States Grand Prix East&quot;. The Caesars Palace Grand Prix ran as a Formula One World Championship race in Las Vegas in and (after which it continued two further years as an event in the CART series). saw the inaugural Detroit Grand Prix in the center of Detroit, Michigan, which ran until . The Formula One season thus featured three Grands Prix in the United States—the first time in World Championship history that a country hosted more than two Grands Prix. Finally, a one-off Dallas Grand Prix in Fair Park, Texas, was held in ; it was plagued by problems with the track surface, exacerbated by extremely hot July weather. After these short-lived events, the historical &quot;United States Grand Prix&quot; returned in at Phoenix and until 2022 remained the only Grand Prix on the F1 calendar to be held in the United States, despite changing locations a few times since.

A potential new Grand Prix in the New York City area was announced for the 1983 season, to be held either at the Meadowlands Sports Complex, Meadow Lake in Flushing Meadows, or Mitchel Field in Hempstead, Long Island (on the same site as the 1936 and 1937 Vanderbilt Cups). However, the race was first postponed and then cancelled, as CART started their own race at the Meadowlands, and titled it the &quot;United States Grand Prix&quot;.
The most serious effort to date to bring a Grand Prix to New York City was the Grand Prix of America at the Port Imperial Street Circuit, which was included on the proposed 2013 calendar but was then cancelled. In 2022, the first Miami Grand Prix was held at the Miami International Autodrome, a track specifically designed for F1, located around the Hard Rock Stadium in the Miami suburb of Miami Gardens, Florida. The first Las Vegas Grand Prix took place on November 18, 2023.

==Winners==
From 1908 to 1916, the race was named the &quot;American Grand Prize&quot;. Six American drivers have won the United States Grand Prix, all except one when it was known as the American Grand Prize, which was not part of the Grand Prix calendar. Chuck Daigh also won it as a non-championship race at Riverside in 1958. But while the event has been part of the Formula One World Championship, no American has won the event; however, Mario Andretti won the 1977 United States Grand Prix West in Long Beach, California.

<text>Our Lady of Fátima (, ; formally known as Our Lady of the Holy Rosary of Fátima) is a Catholic title of Mary, mother of Jesus, based on the Marian apparitions reported in 1917 by three shepherd children at the Cova da Iria in Fátima, Portugal. The three children were Lúcia dos Santos and her cousins Francisco and Jacinta Marto. José Alves Correia da Silva, Bishop of Leiria, declared the events worthy of belief on 13 October 1930.

Pope Pius XII granted a pontifical decree of canonical coronation via the papal bull towards the venerated image on 25 April 1946. The designated papal legate, Cardinal Benedetto Aloisi Masella, carried out the coronation on 13 May 1946, now permanently enshrined at the Chapel of the Apparitions of Fátima. The same Roman Pontiff also raised the Sanctuary of Fátima to the status of a minor basilica by the apostolic letter on 11 November 1954.

The published memoirs of Sister Lúcia in the 1930s revealed two secrets that she claimed came from the Virgin Mary, while the third secret was to be revealed by the Catholic Church in 1960. The controversial events at Fátima, including the Miracle of the Sun, gained fame due partly to elements of the secrets, prophecy and eschatological revelations allegedly related to the Second World War and possibly more global wars in the future, particularly the Virgin&#x27;s request for the Consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.

==History==

=== Marian apparitions ===

Beginning in the spring of 1916, three shepherd children –Lúcia dos Santos, Francisco and Jacinta Marto– reported three apparitions of an Angel in Valinhos. Then on 13 May 1917, in Cova da Iria, six apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary were reported. The children described her as &quot;a Lady more brilliant than the Sun&quot;. The children reported a prophecy that prayer would lead to an end to the Great War, and that on 13 October that year the Lady would reveal her identity and perform a miracle &quot;so that all may believe.&quot; Newspapers reported the prophecies, and many pilgrims began visiting the area. The children&#x27;s accounts were deeply controversial, drawing intense criticism from both local secular and religious authorities. A provincial administrator briefly took the children into custody, believing the prophecies were politically motivated in opposition to the officially secular First Portuguese Republic established in 1910.

On 13 May 1917, the shepherd children reported seeing a woman &quot;brighter than the sun, shedding rays of light clearer and stronger than a crystal goblet filled with the most sparkling water and pierced by the burning rays of the sun.&quot; The woman wore a white mantle edged with gold and held a rosary in her hand. She asked them to devote themselves to the Holy Trinity and to pray &quot;the Rosary every day, to bring peace to the world and an end to the war&quot;. While the children had never told anyone about seeing the angel, Jacinta told her family about seeing the brightly lit woman. Lúcia had earlier said that the three should keep this experience private. Jacinta&#x27;s disbelieving mother told neighbors about it as a joke, and within a day the whole village knew of the children&#x27;s vision.

The children said the woman told them to return to the Cova da Iria on 13 June 1917. Lúcia&#x27;s mother sought counsel from the parish priest, Father Manuel Ferreira, who suggested she allow them to go. He asked to have Lúcia brought to him afterward so that he could question her. The second appearance occurred on 13 June, the feast of Saint Anthony, patron of the local parish church. Lúcia would later report that on this occasion, the lady revealed that Francisco and Jacinta would be taken to Heaven soon, but Lúcia would live longer in order to spread her message and devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.

During the June visit, the children said the lady told them to say the Holy Rosary daily in honor of Our Lady of the Rosary to obtain peace and the end of the Great War. (Three weeks earlier, on 21 April, the first contingent of Portuguese soldiers had embarked for the front lines of the war.) The lady also purportedly revealed to the children a vision of hell, and entrusted a secret to them, described as &quot;good for some and bad for others&quot;. Fr. Ferreira later stated that Lúcia recounted that the lady told her, &quot;I want you to come back on the thirteenth and to learn to read in order to understand what I want of you. ...I don&#x27;t want more.&quot;
In the following months, thousands of people flocked to Fátima and nearby Aljustrel, drawn by reports of visions and miracles. On 13 August 1917, the provincial administrator Artur Santos (no relation to Lúcia dos Santos) intervened. He believed that these events were politically disruptive in the conservative country. He took the children into custody, jailing them before they could reach the Cova da Iria. Santos interrogated and threatened the children to get them to divulge the contents of the secrets. Lúcia&#x27;s mother hoped the officials could persuade the children to end the affair and admit that they had lied. Lúcia told Santos everything short of the secrets, and offered to ask the woman for permission to tell the official the secrets.

That month, instead of the usual apparition in the Cova da Iria on 13 August, the children reported that they saw the Virgin Mary on 19 August, a Sunday, at nearby Valinhos. She asked them again to pray the rosary daily, spoke about the miracle coming in October, and asked them &quot;to pray a lot, a lot for the sinners and sacrifice a lot, as many souls perish in hell because nobody is praying or making sacrifices for them.&quot;

The three children claimed to have seen the Blessed Virgin Mary in a total of six apparitions between 13 May and 13 October 1917. Lúcia also reported a seventh Marian apparition at Cova da Iria. The year 2017 marked the 100th anniversary of the apparitions and it was celebrated with the visit of Pope Francis to the Sanctuary of Fátima.

====Messages====
The words spoken by Our Lady to the three children include:

===== 13 May 1917 =====
:Do not be afraid. I will do you no harm. I am from Heaven. I came to ask you to come here on the thirteenth day for six months at this same time, and then I will tell you who I am and what I want. And afterwards, I will return here a seventh time. Yes, you [Lúcia] will [go to heaven]. She [Jacinta] also [will go to heaven]. Yes [Francisco will go to heaven], but first he must say many rosaries. Would you like to offer yourselves to God to accept all the sufferings which He may send to you in reparation for the countless sins by which He is offended and in supplication for the conversion of sinners? Then you will have much to suffer, but the grace of God will be your comfort.

===== 13 June 1917 =====
:I want you to come on the thirteenth day of next month and to pray the Rosary every day and I want you to learn to read. If she [sick woman] is converted, she will be cured within a year. Yes, I will take Francisco and Jacinta soon [to heaven], but you must remain on earth for some time. Jesus wishes to use you to make me better known and loved. He wishes to establish in the world devotion to my Immaculate Heart. No, my child [you will not be alone], and would that make you suffer? Do not be disheartened. My Immaculate Heart will never abandon you, but will be your refuge and the way that will lead you to God.

===== 13 July 1917 =====
:I want you to come on the thirteenth day of next month and to continue to pray the Rosary every day in honor of Our Lady of the Rosary, in order to obtain peace for the world and the end of the war for she alone can help. Continue to come here every month. In October I will tell you who I am and what I want. And I will perform a miracle so that everyone may see and believe. Sacrifice yourselves for sinners and say often, especially when you make some sacrifice, &#x27;O my Jesus, this is for love of You, for the conversion of sinners, and in reparation for the offenses committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary.&#x27; [A vision of hell] You saw Hell where the souls of poor sinners go. In order to save them, God wishes to establish in the world devotion to my Immaculate Heart. If people do what I ask, many souls will be saved and there will be peace. The war is going to end. But if people do not stop offending God, another, even worse one will begin in the reign of Pius XI. When you shall see a night illuminated by an unknown light know that this is the great sign that God gives you that He is going to punish the world for its many crimes by means of war, hunger, and persecution of the Church and the Holy Father. To prevent it, I shall come to ask for the consecration of Russia to my Immaculate Heart and the Communion of reparation on the first Saturdays. If people attend to my requests, Russia will be converted and the world will have peace. If not, she [Russia] will scatter her errors throughout the world, provoking wars and persecutions of the Church. The good will be martyred, the Holy Father will have much to suffer, and various nations will be destroyed. In the end my Immaculate Heart will triumph. The Holy Father will consecrate Russia to me; it will be converted, and a certain period of peace will be granted to the world. In Portugal the dogmas of the Faith will always be kept. [A vision of the Pope suffering and being martyred] Do not tell this to anyone. Francisco ... yes, you may tell him&quot; [Lúcia and Jacinta both saw and heard Our Lady but Francisco only saw the apparitions]. When you say the Rosary, say after each mystery: O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of Hell and lead all souls to Heaven, especially those most in need.

===== 19 August 1917 =====
:Pray, pray a great deal and make many sacrifices, for many souls go to Hell because they have no one to make sacrifices and to pray for them. St. Joseph too will come with the Holy Child to bring peace to the world. Our Lord will also come to bless the people. Our Lady of the Rosary and Our Lady of Sorrows will come too.

===== 13 September 1917 =====
:You must pray! Continue to pray the Rosary every day in order to obtain the end of the war. In October Our Lord will come, and Our Lady of Sorrows and of Mount Carmel and St. Joseph with the Child Jesus to bless the world. God is pleased with your sacrifices, but He does not want you to sleep with the rope on; wear it only during the day. [Regarding miraculous cures] Some I will cure, others not. In October I shall perform a miracle so that everyone may believe.

===== 13 October 1917 =====
:I am the Lady of the Rosary, I have come to warn the faithful to amend their lives and ask for pardon for their sins. They must not offend Our Lord any more, for He is already too grievously offended by the sins of men. People must say the Rosary. Let them continue saying it everyday. I would like a chapel built here in my honor. The war will end soon.

===Miracle of the Sun===

After some newspapers reported that the Virgin Mary had promised a miracle for the last of her apparitions on 13 October, a huge crowd, possibly between 30,000 and 100,000, including reporters and photographers, gathered at Cova da Iria. What happened then became known as the &quot;Miracle of the Sun&quot;.

Various claims have been made as to what actually happened during the event. The three children who originally claimed to have seen Our Lady of Fátima reported seeing a panorama of visions during the event, including those of Jesus, Our Lady of Sorrows, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, and of Saint Joseph blessing the people. Father John De Marchi, an Italian Catholic priest and researcher wrote several books on the subject, which included descriptions by witnesses who believed they had seen a miracle created by Mary, Mother of God. According to accounts, after a period of rain, the dark clouds broke and the Sun appeared as an opaque, spinning disc in the sky. It was said to be significantly duller than normal, and to cast multicolored lights across the landscape, the people, and the surrounding clouds. The Sun was then reported to have careened towards the Earth before zig-zagging back to its normal position. Witnesses reported that their previously wet clothes became &quot;suddenly and completely dry, as well as the wet and muddy ground that had been previously soaked because of the rain that had been falling&quot;.

Not all witnesses reported seeing the Sun &quot;dance&quot;. Some people only saw the radiant colors, and others, including some believers, saw nothing at all. No unusual phenomenon of the Sun was observed by scientists at the time. Skeptics have offered alternative explanations that include psychological suggestibility of the witnesses, temporary retinal distortion caused by staring at the intense light of the Sun, and optical effects caused by natural meteorological phenomena.

In De Marchi&#x27;s account, he describes Manuel Formigão, the priest who interviewed the children during the apparitions, as alarmed by a discrepancy between a prophecy the children reported, and the current circumstances. According to the children, their apparition predicted that the First World War would end on 13 October 1917. &quot;But listen Lúcia,&quot; De Marchi reports Formigão saying, &quot;The war is still going on. The papers give news of battles after the 13th. How can you explain that if our Lady said the war would end that day?&quot; Lúcia replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know; I only know that I heard her say that the war would end on that day [...] I said exactly what our Lady had said.&quot; Jacinta, the youngest child, was interrogated separately and said the same: &quot;She [Mary] said that we were to say the Rosary every day and that the war would end today.&quot; World War I ended a year later on Armistice Day, 11 November 1918.

De Marchi documented that in the two years prior to the deaths of Francisco and Jacinta Marto in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, the three children periodically refused food and water, or else drank dirty water such as from a laundry pond, as a penance; De Marchi noted that Jacinta&#x27;s mother had forbidden drinking from the pond due to the risk of illness. De Marchi wrote, &quot;In the scorching sun of the serra, when through the bright hours of the day the heat hangs like a hot stove everywhere, they abstained from taking any water through one spell of thirty days, and at another time for nine.&quot; and described Jacinta as being hospitalized for severe bronchial illness, after which she confided to her older cousin that she was still abstaining: &quot;I was thirsty, Lúcia, and I didn&#x27;t drink, and so I offered it to Jesus for sinners.&quot; Lúcia wrote in her 1936 and 1941 memoirs that the Virgin Mary predicted the deaths of Francisco and Jacinta during the second apparition on 13 June 1917.

In one of several memoirs, Lúcia wrote that the children tied &quot;penitence cords&quot; so tightly around their waists that the ropes became blood-stained, and that the apparition of 13 September 1917, told her, &quot;God is pleased with your sacrifices, but He does not want you to sleep with the rope on; only wear it during the day.&quot; Late in life, Lúcia also wrote about doubts she expressed as a child regarding the authenticity of the apparition. She wrote, &quot;I began then to have doubts as to whether these manifestations might be from the devil [...] truly, ever since I had started seeing these things, our home was no longer the same, for joy and peace had fled. What anguish I felt!&quot; She also describes a vivid nightmare she experienced during this time period wherein &quot;the devil was laughing at having deceived me.&quot; De Marchi states that Lúcia told her cousin prior to traveling to Cova da Iria in anticipation of the 13 July 1917 apparition, &quot;If she [the Lady] asks for me, Jacinta, you tell her why I&#x27;m not there. Because I am afraid it is the Devil who sends her to us!&quot; Lúcia wrote in her memoir that on the following day, she was overtaken by a certainty that she should go, despite her earlier dread: &quot;...when it was nearly time to leave, I suddenly felt I had to go, impelled by a strange force that I could hardly resist.&quot; According to De Marchi, &quot;Lúcia&#x27;s doubts were mercifully dissolved&quot;.

==Later years of the children==

Francisco and Jacinta Marto died in the global flu pandemic that began in 1918 and swept the world for two years. Francisco Marto died at home on 4 April 1919, at the age of ten. Jacinta died at the age of nine in Queen Stephanie&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Hospital in Lisbon on 20 February 1920. Their mother Olímpia Marto said that her children predicted their deaths many times to her and to curious pilgrims in the brief period after the Marian apparitions. They are now buried at the Sanctuary of Fátima. They were beatified by Pope John Paul II on 13 May 2000 and canonized by Pope Francis on 13 May 2017.

At the age of fourteen in 1922, Lúcia was sent to the school of the Sisters of Saint Dorothy (Dorothean) in Vilar, a suburb of Porto, Portugal. In 1928 she became a postulant at the convent of the Sisters of Saint Dorothy in Tui, Spain, near the border with Portugal. Lúcia continued to report private visions periodically throughout her life. She reported seeing the Virgin Mary again in 1925 in the convent. This time, she said she was asked to convey the message of the First Saturdays Devotion. She said she had a subsequent vision of the Christ Child reiterating this request. In 1929, Lúcia reported that Mary returned and repeated her request for the Consecration of Russia to her Immaculate Heart. She also reported a 1931 apparition in Rianxo, Galicia, in which she said Jesus visited her, taught her two prayers, and gave a message addressed to the Catholic Church&#x27;s hierarchy.

In 1936 and again in 1941, Sister Lúcia said that the Virgin Mary had predicted the deaths of her two cousins during the second apparition on 13 June 1917. According to Lúcia&#x27;s 1941 account, on 13 June, Lúcia asked the Virgin if the three children would go to heaven when they died. She said that she heard Mary reply, &quot;Yes, I shall take Francisco and Jacinta soon, but you will remain a little longer, since Jesus wishes you to make me known and loved on Earth. He wishes also for you to establish devotion in the world to my Immaculate Heart.&quot;

In 1947, Sister Lúcia left the Dorothean Order and joined the Discalced Carmelite Order in a monastery in Coimbra, Portugal. Lúcia died on 13 February 2005, at the age of 97. Her cell was sealed off by the order of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith as part of examination for her canonization, due to the revelations that Sister Lúcia still had after the events at Fátima.

==Pilgrimage==


The widely reported Miracle of the Sun quickly made Fátima a major pilgrimage centre. Two million pilgrims visited the site in the decade following the events of 1917. A small chapel – the &quot;Capelinha&quot; – was built by locals on the exact site of the Marian apparitions, where the holm oak stood. 

On 13 May 1920, pilgrims defied government troops and enshrined a statue of the Virgin Mary in the chapel. Mass was first officially celebrated there in January 1924. A hostel for the sick was begun in that year. In 1927, the first rector of the sanctuary was appointed, and a set of Stations of the Cross were erected on the mountain road. The foundation stone for the Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary was laid nearby the next year.

In 1930, the Catholic Church officially recognised the apparition events as &quot;worthy of belief&quot; and granted a papal indulgence to pilgrims visiting Fátima. In 1935, the bodies of the child visionaries, Francisco and Jacinta, were reinterred in the new basilica. Pope Pius XII granted a Canonical Coronation of the statue of Our Lady of Fátima on 13 May 1946. This event drew such large crowds that the entrance to the site had to be barred.

In the 21st century, pilgrimages to the site occur year-round. Additional chapels, hospitals and other facilities have been constructed at the site. The principal pilgrimages take place on the thirteenth day of each month from May to October, on the anniversaries of the original apparitions. The largest crowds gather on 13 May and 13 October, when up to a million pilgrims pray and witness processions of the statue of Our Lady of Fátima, both in the day and by the light of tens of thousands of candles at night.

==Official position of the Church==

The reported visions at Fátima gathered widespread attention as numerous pilgrims began to visit the site. After a canonical inquiry, the Bishop of Leiria-Fátima officially declared the visions of Fátima as &quot;worthy of belief&quot; in October 1930, officially permitting the belief of Our Lady of Fátima.

==Political aspects==
At the time of the apparitions, Portugal was undergoing tensions between the secularizing Republican government and more conservative elements in society. The First Republic had begun with the revolution of 1910 overthrowing the constitutional monarch. It was intensely anticlerical and provoked a strong conservative reaction, ultimately leading to the military coup of 1926. Later in Spain during the 1920s and 1930s, as the forces of the Republic gathered strength, armies of faithful Roman Catholics carried images of the Virgin Mary, as protest and protection against groups they called godless.

During the Spanish Second Republic, apparitions of the Virgin Mary were seen on Spanish soil at Ezquioga. Ramona Olazabal said that Mary had marked the palms of her hands with a sword. The visions at Ezquioga were widely covered in the press, as were sixteen other visitations of the Virgin reported in 1931 in Spain. These visions gained much credence in Integrist and Carlist circles and conservative elements in the Spanish Catholic Church actively encouraged the Fátima devotion as a way of countering the threat of atheistic Communism. In Portugal and its former colony of Brazil, conservative groups were sometimes associated with the veneration of Fátima. 

The original apparitions took place during the six months immediately preceding the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, and the children related that the Lady talked to them about the need to pray for Russia. Lúcia admitted later that the children initially thought she meant prayers for a girl named &quot;Russia&quot;. In the first edition of Sister Lúcia&#x27;s memoirs, published after the outbreak of World War II, she focused on the issue of Russia. The warning by the Lady that &quot;if Russia was not consecrated to God, it would spread errors throughout the world&quot; was often seized upon as an anti-Communist rallying cry.

The Blue Army of Our Lady of Fátima, for instance, has always been strongly anti-Communist and its members often associated the Fátima story in the context of the Cold War. The Blue Army is made up of Catholics and non-Catholics who believe that by dedicating themselves to daily prayer (specifically recitation of the Rosary), they can help to achieve world peace and end to the error of Communism. Organizations such as the Blue Army (now called the World Apostolate of Fátima) have gained the approval of the Catholic Church.

== Memoirs of Sister Lúcia ==

The Fátima story developed in two parts: that which was reported in 1917 and 1922, and information later mentioned in Sister Lúcia&#x27;s memoirs which she wrote years later, after the church ruled that the events in Fátima were &quot;worthy of belief.&quot; Some scholars argue that her memoir was not subject to the same scrutiny. The early messages focused on the need to pray the rosary for peace and the end to World War I.

The alleged supernatural events in Fátima were not widely known outside Portugal and Spain until Lúcia published her memoirs, starting in the late 1930s. Between 1935 and 1993, she wrote six memoirs. The first four, written between 1935 and 1941 during World War II, were published under the title &quot;Fatima in Lucia&#x27;s Own Words&quot; (1976). The fifth and sixth memoirs, written in 1989 and 1993, are published as &quot;Fatima in Lucia&#x27;s Own Words II&quot;.

In the mid-1930s the Bishop of Leiria encouraged Lúcia (at that time named Sister Maria Lúcia das Dores) to write her memoirs, so that she might reveal further details of the 1917 apparitions. In her first memoir, published in 1935, Sister Lúcia focused on the holiness of her cousin, Jacinta Marto. The deceased girl was by then popularly considered a saint. In her second memoir, published in 1937, Lúcia wrote more about her own life, the apparition of 13 June 1917, and first reveals the earlier apparitions of the Angel of Peace.

Finding herself inundated with constantly repeated questions concerning the Marian apparitions that occurred in Fátima, Portugal, and the visionaries, the message they received and the reason for some of the requests contained in that message, and feeling that it was beyond her to reply individually to each questioner, Sister Lúcia asked the Holy See for permission to write a text in which she could reply in general to the many questions that had been put to her. This permission was granted and in December 2000, a new book was published entitled &quot;Calls from the Message of Fatima&quot;.

===Three Secrets of Fátima===
In her third memoir of 1941, Sister Lúcia described three secrets. She said these had been entrusted to the children during the apparitions of 1917.

====First Secret====
This was a vision of Hell, which Lúcia said they experienced on 4 July 1917.
[Mary] opened Her hands once more, as She had done the two previous months. The rays [of light] appeared to penetrate the earth, and we saw, as it were, a vast sea of fire. Plunged in this fire, we saw the demons and the souls [of the damned].

The latter were like transparent burning embers, all blackened or burnished bronze, having human forms. They were floating about in that conflagration, now raised into the air by the flames which issued from within themselves, together with great clouds of smoke. Now they fell back on every side like sparks in huge fires, without weight or equilibrium, amid shrieks and groans of pain and despair, which horrified us and made us tremble with fright (it must have been this sight which caused me to cry out, as people say they heard me).
====Second Secret====
This was a recommendation for devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary as a way to save souls and bring peace to the world. It predicted an end to the Great War, but predicted a worse one if people did not cease offending God. This second war would be presaged by a night illuminated by an unknown light, as a &quot;great sign&quot; that the time of chastisement was near. To avert this, Mary would return to ask for the consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart, and the establishment of the First Saturdays Devotion. If her requests were heeded, Russia would be converted, and there would be peace; if not, Russia would spread her errors throughout the world, causing wars and persecutions of the Catholic Church. The vision culminated with a promise that in the end, &quot;the Immaculate Heart would triumph. The Holy Father would consecrate Russia to Mary, and a period of peace would be granted to the world.&quot;

On 25 January 1938 (during solar cycle 17), bright lights, an aurora borealis appeared over the northern hemisphere, including in places as far south as North Africa, Bermuda and California. It was the widest occurrence of the aurora since 1709 and people in Paris and elsewhere thought it was a great fire and notified fire departments. Sister Lúcia indicated that it was the sign foretold and so apprised her superior and the bishop in letters the following day. Just over a month later, Hitler seized Austria and eight months later invaded Czechoslovakia.

=====Consecration of Russia=====

According to Sister Lúcia, the Virgin Mary promised that the Consecration of Russia would lead to Russia&#x27;s conversion and an era of peace. At the time the supposed request for the consecration of Russia was made, however, the Bolsheviks had not yet taken control of Russia.

Pope Pius XII, in his Apostolic Letter &quot;Sacro Vergente&quot; of 7 July 1952, consecrated Russia to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Pius XII wrote,

:&quot;Just as a few years ago We consecrated the entire human race to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin Mary, Mother of God, so today We consecrate and in a most special manner We entrust all the peoples of Russia to this Immaculate Heart...&quot;

In 1952 the Pope said to the Russian people and the Stalinist regime that the Virgin Mary was always victorious. &quot;The gates of hell will never prevail, where she offers her protection. She is the good mother, the mother of all, and it has never been heard, that those who seek her protection, will not receive it. With this certainty, the Pope dedicates all people of Russia to the immaculate heart of the Virgin. She will help! Error and atheism will be overcome with her assistance and divine grace.&quot;

Popes Pius XII and John Paul II both had a special relationship with Our Lady of Fátima. Pope Benedict XV began Pacelli&#x27;s church career, elevating him to archbishop in the Sistine Chapel on 13 May 1917, the date of the first apparition. Pius XII was laid to rest in the crypt of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica on 13 October 1958, the anniversary of the final apparition and the Miracle of the Sun.

Pope John Paul II again consecrated the entire world to the Virgin Mary in 1984, without explicitly mentioning Russia. Some believe that Sister Lúcia verified that this ceremony fulfilled the requests of the Virgin Mary. However, in the Blue Army&#x27;s Spanish magazine, &quot;Sol de Fátima&quot;, in the September 1985 issue, Sister Lúcia said that the ceremony did not fulfil the Virgin Mary&#x27;s request, as there was no specific mention of Russia and &quot;many bishops attached no importance to it.&quot; In 2001, Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone met with Sister Lúcia, who reportedly told him, &quot;I have already said that the consecration desired by Our Lady was made in 1984, and has been accepted in Heaven.&quot; Sister Lúcia died on 13 February 2005, without making any further public statement of her own to settle the issue.

Some maintain that, according to Lúcia and Fátima advocates such as Abbé Georges de Nantes, Fr. Paul Kramer and Nicholas Gruner, Russia has never been specifically consecrated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary by any Pope simultaneously with all the world&#x27;s bishops, which is what Lúcia in the 1985 interview had said Mary had asked for. Two interviews with Sister Lúcia, in 1992 and 1993, tape recorded and televised with her permission on Portuguese State Television RTP1 and on SIC, TVI and RAI 2, in March 1998, finally clarified the Seer&#x27;s personal opinion regarding the Secret, Consecration and Conversion of Russia.

However, by letters of 29 August 1989 and 3 July 1990, she stated that the consecration had been completed; indeed in the 1990 letter in response to a question by the Rev. Father Robert J. Fox, she confirmed:
I come to answer your question, &quot;If the consecration made by Pope John Paul II on 25 March 1984 in union with all the bishops of the world, accomplished the conditions for the consecration of Russia according to the request of Our Lady in Tui, Spain on 13 June 1929?&quot; Yes, it was accomplished, and since then I have said that it was made.

And I say that no other person responds for me, it is I who receive and open all letters and respond to them.
In the meantime, the conception of Theotokos Derzhavnaya, Orthodox Christian venerated icon, points out that Virgin Mary is considered actual Tsarina of Russia by the religious appeal of Nicholas II; thus &quot;Consecration of Russia&quot; may refer to return of Russian monarchy. The icon was brought to Fátima in 2003 and 2014, together with another significant icon, the Theotokos of Port Arthur.

====Third Secret====
The third secret, a vision of the death of the Pope and other religious figures, was transcribed by the Bishop of Leiria and reads:

:&quot;After the two parts which I have already explained, at the left of Our Lady and a little above, we saw an Angel with a flaming sword in his left hand; flashing, it gave out flames that looked as though they would set the world on fire; but they died out in contact with the splendour that Our Lady radiated towards him from her right hand: pointing to the earth with his right hand, the Angel cried out in a loud voice: &#x27;Penance, Penance, Penance!&#x27; And we saw in an immense light that is God: &#x27;something similar to how people appear in a mirror when they pass in front of it&#x27; a Bishop dressed in White &#x27;we had the impression that it was the Holy Father&#x27;. Other Bishops, Priests, Religious men and women going up a steep mountain, at the top of which there was a big Cross of rough-hewn trunks as of a cork-tree with the bark; before reaching there the Holy Father passed through a big city half in ruins and half trembling with halting step, afflicted with pain and sorrow, he prayed for the souls of the corpses he met on his way; having reached the top of the mountain, on his knees at the foot of the big Cross he was killed by a group of soldiers who fired bullets and arrows at him, and in the same way there died one after another the other Bishops, Priests, Religious men and women, and various lay people of different ranks and positions. Beneath the two arms of the Cross there were two Angels each with a crystal aspersorium in his hand, in which they gathered up the blood of the Martyrs and with it sprinkled the souls that were making their way to God.&quot;

=====Controversy around the Third Secret=====

Lúcia declared that the Third Secret could be released to the public after 1960. Some sources, including Chanoine Barthas and Cardinal Ottaviani, said that Lúcia insisted to them it must be released by 1960, saying that, &quot;by that time, it will be more clearly understood&quot;, and, &quot;because the Blessed Virgin wishes it so.&quot; Instead, in 1960 the Vatican published an official press release stating that it was &quot;most probable the Secret would remain, forever, under absolute seal.&quot; This announcement triggered widespread speculation. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that speculation over the content of the secret ranged from &quot;worldwide nuclear annihilation&quot; to &quot;deep rifts in the Roman Catholic Church that lead to rival papacies.&quot;

The Vatican did not publish the Third Secret, a four-page, handwritten text, until 26 June 2000.

Such writers as Father Paul Kramer, Christopher Ferrara, Antonio Socci, and Marco Tosatti have suggested that this was not the full text of the secret and stating the Third Secret is not the full text. They alleged that Cardinals Bertone, Ratzinger and Sodano concealed the existence of another one-page document, containing information about the Apocalypse and a great apostasy.

The Vatican has maintained its position that the full text of the Third Secret was published. According to a December 2001 Vatican press release (published in &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;), Lúcia told then-Archbishop Bertone in an interview that the secret had been completely revealed when published.

During his apostolic visit to Portugal during 11–14 May 2010 on the 10th anniversary of the beatification of Jacinta and Francisco Marto, Pope Benedict XVI explained to reporters that the interpretation of the third secret did not only refer to the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II in Saint Peter&#x27;s Square in 1981. He said that the third secret, &quot;has a permanent and ongoing significance,&quot; and that, &quot;its significance could even be extended to include the suffering the Church is going through today as a result of the recent reports of sexual abuse involving the clergy.&quot;

==Fátima prayers and reparations==

Many Roman Catholics recite prayers based on the apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima. Lúcia later said that, in 1916, she and her cousins had several visions of an angel calling himself the &quot;Angel of Portugal&quot; and the &quot;Angel of Peace,&quot; who taught them to bow with their heads to the ground and to say &quot;My God, I believe, I adore, I hope, and I love you. I ask pardon for those who do not believe, do not adore, do not hope and do not love you.&quot; Lúcia later set this prayer to music and a recording exists of her singing it. It was also said that sometime later, the angel returned and taught them a eucharistic devotion now known as the Angel Prayer.

Lúcia said that the Lady emphasized Acts of Reparation and prayers to console Jesus for the sins of the world. Lúcia said that Mary&#x27;s words were, &quot;When you make some sacrifice, say &#x27;O Jesus, it is for your love, for the conversion of sinners, and in reparation for sins committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary.&#x27;&quot; At the apparition of 13 July 1917, Lúcia said Mary told the children that sinners could be saved from damnation by devotion to the Immaculate Heart, but also by making &quot;sacrifices&quot;. They heard her repeat the idea of sacrifices several times. Her vision of hell prompted them to ever more stringent self-mortifications to save souls. Among many other practices, Lúcia wrote that she and her cousins wore tight cords around their waists, flogged themselves with stinging nettles, gave their lunches to beggars, and abstained from drinking water on hot days. Francisco and Jacinta became extremely devoted to this practice. Lúcia wrote that Mary said God was pleased with their sacrifices and bodily penances.

At the first apparition, Lúcia wrote, the children were so moved by the radiance that they involuntarily said &quot;Most Holy Trinity, I adore you! My God, my God, I love you in the Most Blessed Sacrament.&quot; Lúcia also said that she heard Mary ask for the following words to be added to the Rosary after the Gloria Patri prayer: &quot;O my Jesus, pardon us, save us from the fires of hell. Lead all souls to heaven, especially those in most need.&quot;

According to Vatican teaching on the tradition of Marian visitations, references to the &quot;conversion of sinners&quot; do not necessarily mean religious conversion to the Roman Catholic Church. Pope Leo XIII, in his encyclical on the &quot;Unity of the Church, Satis Cognitum&quot;, said that would mean the &quot;conversion of heretics or apostates who are &#x27;outside the church and alien to the Christian Faith.&#x27; Rather, &quot;conversion of sinners&quot; refers to general repentance and an attempt to amend one&#x27;s life according to the teachings of Jesus for those true Catholics who are fallen into sins. Lúcia wrote that she and her cousins defined &quot;sinners&quot; not as non-Catholics but as those who had fallen away from the church or, more specifically, willfully indulged in sinful activity, particularly &quot;sins of the flesh&quot; and &quot;acts of injustice and a lack of charity towards the poor, widows and orphans, the ignorant and the helpless,&quot; which she said were even worse than sins of impurity.

==Pontifical approbations==
Karl Rahner and other theologians opines that the Pontiff, by authoritatively fostering the Marian veneration in places such as Fátima and Lourdes, motivate the faithful into an acceptance of divine faith. In October 1930, Bishop da Silva declared that the apparitions at Fátima were &quot;worthy of belief,&quot; and approved public devotion to the Blessed Virgin under the title Our Lady of Fátima. Since then, the Vatican granted indulgences and permitted special Liturgies of the Mass to be celebrated in Fátima.

===Pope Pius XII===
* Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli was consecrated as a bishop on 13 May 1917 – the day of the first apparition – and was elected to the papacy as Pope Pius XII in 1939. He is considered to have become &quot;the Pope of Fátima.&quot; In 1940, after the Second World War had started, Sister Lúcia asked Pope Pius XII to consecrate the world and Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. She repeated this request later that year on 2 December 1940, stating that in the year 1929, the Blessed Lady requested in another apparition that Russia be consecrated to her Immaculate Heart. Mary was said to promise the conversion of Russia from its errors.
* On 13 May 1942, the 25th anniversary of the first apparition and the silver jubilee of the episcopal consecration of Pope Pius XII, the Vatican published the &quot;Message and Secret of Fátima.&quot; 
* On 31 October 1942, Pius XII in a radio address to the people of Portugal discussed the apparitions of Fátima and consecrated the human race to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin, with specific mention of &quot;peoples of Russia&quot;. 
* On 8 December 1942, the Pope officially and solemnly declared this consecration in a ceremony in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome. This consecration was made in the context of the reported messages from Jesus and the Virgin Mary received by Alexandrina of Balazar, and communicated to her spiritual director, Mariano Pinho.
* On 25 April 1946, Pope Pius XII granted a pontifical decree of canonical coronation titled &quot;Celeberrima Solemnia&quot; for the statue of Our Lady. Cardinal Benedetto Masella was assigned as the papal legate who crowned the image on 13 May 1946.
* On 1 May 1948, in &quot;Auspicia Quaedam&quot;, Pope Pius XII requested the consecration to the Immaculate Heart of every Catholic family, parish and diocese.
* On 18 May 1950, the Pope again sent a message to the people of Portugal regarding Fátima: In numerous additional messages, and in his encyclicals &quot;Fulgens Corona&quot; (1953), and &quot;Ad Caeli Reginam&quot; (1954), Pius XII encouraged the veneration of the Virgin in Fátima.
* On 11 November 1954, he raised the sanctuary to the status of basilica via the decree &quot;Luce Superna&quot;.

===Pope Paul VI===

At the end of the Second Vatican Council, Pope Paul VI renewed the consecration of Pius XII to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. In an unusual gesture, he announced his own pilgrimage to the sanctuary on the fiftieth anniversary of the first apparition. On 13 May 1967, he prayed at the shrine together with Sister Lúcia.

===Pope John Paul II===

Pope John Paul II on 25 March 1984 consecrated &quot;the world&quot; in a public ceremony at St. Peter&#x27;s in Rome; the consecration was in the form of a &#x27;whole-world consecration&#x27; carried out in union with the Catholic bishops throughout the world. Cardinal Bertone said to the press many times that the message of Fátima was finished.

He further credited Our Lady of Fátima with saving his life following an assassination attempt on 13 May 1981, the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima. Then on 12 May 1982, he expressed his gratitude to the Virgin Mary for saving his life. The following day, he renewed the consecration of Pius XII to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin.

In 1984, John Paul II offered to the statue of Fátima one of the bullets that struck him in the assassination attempt in St. Peter&#x27;s Square, which is now enchased in the image&#x27;s crown.

===Pope Benedict XVI===
On 12–13 May 2010, Pope Benedict XVI visited the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima and strongly stated his acceptance of the supernatural origin of the Fátima apparitions. On the first day, the Pope arrived at the Chapel of Apparitions to pray; he gave a Golden Rose to Our Lady of Fátima &quot;as a homage of gratitude from the Pope for the marvels that the Almighty has worked through you in the hearts of so many who come as pilgrims to this your maternal home&quot;. The Pope also recalled the &quot;invisible hand&quot; that saved John Paul II. He said in a prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary that &quot;it is a profound consolation to know that you are crowned not only with the silver and gold of our joys and hopes, but also with the &#x27;bullet&#x27; of our anxieties and sufferings.&quot;

On the second day, Pope Benedict spoke to more than 500,000 pilgrims; he referred to the Fátima prophecy about the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and related it to the final &quot;glory of the Most Holy Trinity.&quot;

===Pope Francis===
Amid the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Latin Catholic bishops requested Pope Francis to &quot;... publicly perform the act of consecration to the Sacred Immaculate Heart of Mary of Ukraine and Russia, as requested by the Blessed Virgin in Fatima. May the Mother of God, Queen of Peace, accept our prayer: Regina pacis, ora pro nobis!&quot;

Pope Francis consecrated Russia and Ukraine to the Immaculate Heart of Mary on 25 March 2022 at Saint Peter’s Basilica in Rome, stating: &quot;Mother of God and our mother, to your Immaculate Heart we solemnly entrust and consecrate ourselves, the church and all humanity, especially Russia and Ukraine&quot;. A consecration ceremony also occurred in Fatima, Portugal, by the Papal almoner, Cardinal Konrad Krajewski. The Pope had announced the event via Twitter on 15 March 2022. It is unknown whether the consecration involved all the world&#x27;s bishops on the same day or how it fulfilled the specific conditions of the Virgin&#x27;s requests.

== Sainthood ==
In March 2017 the Holy See announced that Pope Francis would canonize two of the visionaries, Francisco and Jacinta Marto, on 13 May at a Mass in Fátima during a two-day visit. The decision followed papal confirmation of a miracle attributed to the intercession of the two visionaries. The pope canonized the children on 13 May 2017 during the centennial of the first apparition.

Sister Lúcia&#x27;s cause for canonization is ongoing and she was declared Venerable by Pope Francis on 22 June 2023.

==Other images of Our Lady of Fátima==


Several statues of Our Lady under Fátima&#x27;s title are notable, among which are the following:
* The first sculpture, carved by in 1920, now enshrined within the Chapel of the Apparitions. It was canonically crowned on 13 May 1946 by Pope Pius XII. Since 1981, this image was venerated by Pope John Paul II, who given a bullet from his attempted assassination to the sanctuary, which added it to the statue&#x27;s crown in the late 1980s.
* The &quot;Immaculate Heart of Mary,&quot; installed above the main façade of Fátima&#x27;s basilica. 
* Two copies of the &quot;International Pilgrim Statue of Fátima,&quot; informally known as the &quot;Pilgrim Statue,&quot; have been taken around the world to Catholic audiences. The second was sent to the Americas after being blessed on 13 October 1947 by the local bishop of Leiria. Subsequent copies have similarly been circulated internationally, including one smuggled into the US embassy to the Soviet Union. Since 1984, another copy has been enshrined in the Immaculate Heart of Mary Shrine at the Congregation of the Mother of the Redeemer&#x27;s monastery in Carthage, Missouri. The statue is removed once a year during the Marian Days celebration for a procession around Carthage.
* The so-called &quot;U.N. Virgin&quot; Fátima statue, which once stood in the chapel of the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York City, United States. It was blessed by the Bishop of Leiria on 13 October 1952.
* A statue of Our Lady of Fátima is carried in procession as part of the festival of Quyllur Rit&#x27;i, held in the highlands of the mountains Sinaqara and Qullqipunku in Cusco Region, Peru. The festival attracts 10,000 pilgrims annually.
*The &quot;National Pilgrim Image of Our Lady of Fátima-Philippines,&quot; also known as the &quot;EDSA Image,&quot; is a gift to the Philippines from the Sanctuary of Fátima, enshrined at the National Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima in Valenzuela in Metro Manila. It was blessed by Pope Paul VI in 1967 on the 50th anniversary of the Apparitions. It was crowned as the &quot;National Pilgrim Image&quot; in 1984 by Cardinal Jaime Sin, Archbishop of Manila, and became the main Fátima&#x27;s image during the peaceful People Power Revolution in 1986 that ousted the dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos. The image has been since been brought around the country to various churches and schools. The image was given an episcopal coronation by the late José Oliveros, Bishop of Malolos, on 13 May 2017, with the crown and rosary as gifts from the Sanctuary of Fátima. Pope Francis issued a decree of canonical coronation for the image on 21 November 2023; the coronation took place on 25 February 2024.

== Scepticism ==
The phenomenon of Fatima apparitions has been embroiled in great controversy since its inception, with heated arguments involving not only atheists and agnostics, but also Catholics. Skeptics completely doubt the existence of the apparitions, the veracity of the dialogues, the miracles and cures. Some mention that the apparitions have nothing to do with religion; others treat the events as a great staging. The Catholic Church itself seems to have been very cautious, not recognizing the apparitions as credible until October 1930. Cardinal Cerejeira stated that &quot;it was Fatima that imposed itself on the Church&quot;.

The first accounts of the apparitions given by the little shepherds in 1917 and the story told in later Lúcia&#x27;s Memoirs clearly differ in text and content. In fact, even some Catholics, like the Jesuit Edouard Dhanis, suggest that there are two different Fatimas: &quot;Fatima I&quot; (the one in the 1917 accounts) and &quot;Fatima II&quot; (the one revealed in the &quot;memoirs&quot; of the main seer, written between 1935 and 1941).

Father Mário de Oliveira, author of some books on Fatima, commented that the God announced and revealed in the &quot;Memoirs of Sister Lucia&quot; – &quot;has nothing to do with the God revealed in Jesus of Nazareth. It has everything to do with a bloodthirsty God who delights in the suffering of the innocent, a God who creates hell to punish those who fail to go to Mass on sundays or say bad words, a God who is even worse than some of his creatures.&quot; He notes that Jacinta and Francisco were capable of going entire days without eating, or drinking a drop of water, even in the middle of August, and walking around all day, and even in their sleep at night, with a rope permanently tied to their waist, in what the author calls &quot;religious masochism&quot;. About Lúcia, the writer says that she was taken from her homeland and forever prevented from leading a life in any way similar to that of common people (she was secretly interned in the Vilar Asylum in Porto, and then she was sent to Spain and made a cloistered nun for the rest of her life).

Alfredo Barroso, journalist and politician, claims that the &quot;Miracle of Fatima&quot; never existed, and that it is a &quot;product of illiteracy, ignorance and the beliefs of three children terrorised by the image of a cruel, vengeful and punishing God&quot;. For Barroso, the &quot;miracle of Fatima&quot; became a weapon to hurl against the Republic, freedom and democracy, against atheism and communism, in a classic alliance between &quot;the sword and the hyssop&quot; under the aegis of the dictator Salazar.

Tomás da Fonseca, author of some books on the subject and one of Fátima&#x27;s fiercest critics, considers it &quot;the biggest hoax of this century&quot;. He claims that three priests – Manuel Marques Ferreira, Benevenuto de Sousa e Abel Ventura do Céu Faria – decided to promote apparitions for purely profitable purposes, but the evidence is very weak. João Ilharco, a professor, wrote a book that made him lose his job, &quot;Fátima desmascarada&quot; (1971)&quot;,&quot; with similar claims, but also lacking evidence. The journalist and writer Patrícia Carvalho states that the gratuitous attacks and accusations against specific figures of the Church, without irrefutable proof, characterised the first texts opposing Fatima, as well some of the books later published about it.

=== The descriptions of the Lady (1917–1922) ===
Soon after the events of 1917, the parish priest, Manuel Marques Ferreira, carried out successive interrogations of the three children after each of the apparitions; Father José Fereira de Lacerda, and the Rev. Manuel Nunes Formigão, also spoke to them. Rev. Formigão wrote notes and books on the subject.

The testimonies by the three children (especially that of Lúcia, the most gifted of the seers) state that the apparition was about more or less one meter tall and looked like a child 12 to 15 years old, of extraordinary beauty. She had black eyes. She was dressed in a so luminous white that hurt the eyes. Lúcia and Jacinta tell us that her skirt (sic) was white and gold, with strings running from top to bottom and across, and was short, to her knees or a little below, and tight. She had white socks. Her coat was white and she also had a white cloak, which went down from her head to the hem of her skirt, with gold strings running from top to bottom. The jacket had two or three strings on the cuffs. She had a golden cord around her neck, which ended with a ball or a medal; she had very small yellow buttons (or rings – in Portuguese: &quot;arrecadas&quot;&quot;) in her ears. In her hands she carried a rosary of white beads, also luminous, which ended in a cross. In the words of Lúcia, on her head she had a sort of &quot;small basket&quot; (in Portuguese: &quot;&quot;açafatezinho&quot; or, a &quot;açafatico&quot;&quot;) which also radiated light. She never smiled. Francisco also said that she spoke without moving her lips.

The image that is venerated today was &quot;with minor changes in detail&quot; inspired by an existing image of Our Lady of Lapa. Manuel Nunes Formigão commented: &quot;Our Lady can only appear as decently and modestly dressed as possible. The dress should go down to about her feet&quot; The length of the skirt was something scandalous for the times; and Rev.Formigão said it was the most serious difficulty to the supernaturality of the apparition, maybe a mystification by the &quot;spirit of darkness&quot;.

Chanoine Barthas refers to the apparition as &quot;the wonderful young lady&quot; and admits that &quot;she does not resemble any of the images of the Blessed Virgin or other saints&quot; that they have seen up to that point. Later descriptions of the Lady progressively move away from these primordial accounts, until it is difficult to recognise them. The image of the Lady was given a more &quot;classic&quot; appearance, and in 1930 Dr. Gonzaga da Fonseca, in Rome, already described the Lady wearing a tunic and a mantle that descends to the bare feet.

==In popular culture==
Our Lady of Fátima was played by Virginia Gibson in an uncredited role in the 1952 film &quot;The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima&quot;. She was played by Joana Ribeiro in the 2020 film, &quot;Fatima&quot;. The Three Secrets of Fátima are a major plot point in the 2022 visual novel &quot;Anonymous;Code&quot;.

<text>Edison records was one of the early record labels that pioneered sound recording and reproduction, and was an important and successful company in the early recording industry.

The first phonograph cylinders were manufactured in 1888, followed by Edison&#x27;s foundation of the Edison Phonograph Company in the same year. The recorded wax cylinders, later replaced by Blue Amberol cylinders, and vertical-cut Diamond Discs, were manufactured by Edison&#x27;s National Phonograph Company from 1896 on, reorganized as Thomas A. Edison, Inc. in 1911. Until 1910 the recordings did not carry the names of the artists. The company began to lag behind its rivals in the 1920s, both technically and in the popularity of its artists, and halted production of recordings in 1929.

== Before commercial mass-produced records ==
Thomas A. Edison invented the phonograph, the first device for recording and playing back sound, in 1877. After patenting the invention and benefiting from the publicity and acclaim it received, Edison and his laboratory turned their attention to the commercial development of electric lighting, playing no further role in the development of the phonograph for nearly a decade. Edison&#x27;s original phonograph recorded on sheets of tinfoil and was little more than a crude curiosity, although one that fascinated much of the public. These earliest phonographs were sold mainly to entrepreneurs who made a living out of traveling around the country giving &quot;educational&quot; lectures in hired halls or otherwise demonstrating the device to audiences for a fee. The tinfoil phonograph was not fit for any real practical use and public interest soon waned.

== Beginnings of the commercial record industry ==
In 1887, Edison turned his attention back to improving the phonograph and the phonograph cylinder. The following year, the Edison company debuted the &quot;Perfected Phonograph.&quot; Edison introduced wax cylinders approximately long and in external diameter, which became the industry standard. They had a maximum playing time of about 3 minutes at 120 RPM, but around the turn of the century the standard speed was increased to (first 144) and then 160 RPM to improve clarity and volume, reducing the maximum to about 2 minutes and 15 seconds. Several experimental wax cylinder recordings of music and speech made in 1888 still exist.

The wax entertainment cylinder made its commercial debut in 1889 (a relatively well-preserved and freely available example from that year is the &quot;Fifth Regiment March&quot;, played by Issler&#x27;s Orchestra). At first, the only customers were entrepreneurs who installed nickel-in-the-slot phonographs in amusement arcades, saloons and other public places. At that time, a phonograph cost the equivalent of several months&#x27; wages for the average worker and was driven by an electric motor powered by hazardous, high-maintenance wet cell batteries. After more affordable spring-motor-driven phonographs designed for home use were introduced in 1895, the industry of producing recorded entertainment cylinders for sale to the general public began in earnest.

Blank records were an important part of the business early on. Most phonographs had or could be fitted with attachments for the users to make their own recordings. One important early use, in line with the original term for a phonograph as a &quot;talking machine&quot;, was in business for recording dictation. Attachments were added to facilitate starting, stopping, and skipping back the recording for dictation and playback by stenographers. The business phonograph eventually evolved into a separate device from the home entertainment phonograph. Edison&#x27;s brand of business phonograph was called &quot;The Ediphone&quot;; see Phonograph cylinder and Dictaphone. Edison also holds the achievement of being one of the first companies to record the first African-American quartet to record: the Unique Quartet.

== Mass-produced cylinders ==
A significant technological development at the Edison Laboratories was devising a method to mass-produce pre-recorded phonograph cylinders in molds. This was done by using very slightly tapered cylinders and molding in a material that contracted as it set. To Edison&#x27;s disappointment, the commercial potential of this process was not realized for some years. Most of the regional Edison distributors were able to fill the small early market for recordings by mechanical duplication of a few dozen cylinders at a time. Molded cylinders did not become a significant force in the marketplace until the end of the 1890s, which was when molding was slow and was used only to create pantograph masters.

Before using metal cylinders though Edison used paraffin paper. Mass-producing cylinders at the Edison recording studio in New Jersey largely ended the local Edison retailers early practice of producing recordings in small numbers for regional markets, and helped concentrate the USA recording industry in the New York City – New Jersey area, already the headquarters of the nation&#x27;s Tin Pan Alley printed music industry.

In 1902, Edison&#x27;s National Phonograph Company introduced Edison Gold Moulded Records, cylinder records of improved hard black wax, capable of being played hundreds of times before wearing out. These new records were under the working title of &quot;Edison Hi-Speed Extra Loud Moulded Records&quot;, running at the speed of 160 RPM instead of the usual (ca. 1898–1902) speed of 144 RPM or (ca. 1889–1897) 120 RPM. Until ca. 1898, Edison&#x27;s speed was 125 RPM.

In 1908, Edison introduced a new line of cylinders (called Amberol) playing 4 rather than 2 minutes of music on the same sized record, achieved by shrinking the grooves and spacing them twice as close together. New machines were sold to play these records, as were attachments for modifying existing Edison phonographs.

In November 1912, the new Blue Amberol Records, made out of a type of smooth, hard plastic similar to celluloid invented by Edison labs, were introduced for public sale. The first release was number 1501, a performance of the Rossini&#x27;s overture to his opera &quot;Semiramide&quot;, performed by the American Standard Orchestra. The plastic Blue Amberol records were much more durable than wax cylinders. The Edison lab claimed a 3000+ playback quota for the Blue Amberol. In that same year, the Edison Disc Record came out.

In 1910, artists&#x27; names began to be added to the records; previously, Edison&#x27;s policy was to promote his cylinders (and up until 1915, discs) based on the recognition of composers and the works recorded thereon in lieu of the performers themselves.

Thomas A. Edison, Inc., successor to the National Phonograph Company, continued selling cylinders until they went out of the record business in November 1929. However, from January 1915 onwards these were simply dubs of their commercial disc records intended for customers who still used cylinder phonographs purchased years before. The book, &quot;Edison Cylinder Records, 1889-1912,&quot; by Allen Koenigsberg, APM Press, lists and dates all American Edison wax cylinders (2-4 min.); .

== Materials and process used to manufacture cylinder records ==

Cylinders that are mentioned from 1888 are sometimes called &quot;yellow paraffin&quot; cylinders, but these cylinders are not paraffin, which is a soft oily wax and would not hold up over many plays. They could be a number of formulas tested by Jonas Aylsworth, Thomas Edison&#x27;s chemist. Most of the surviving 1888 recordings would be formulated from a combination of ceresin wax, carnauba wax, stearic acid, and beeswax. A record of this kind has a cigar-like smell and is physically very soft when first molded. In a year&#x27;s time, the record would harden quite considerably. To play these first cylinders, the model B reproducer must be used. The other later reproducers (such as C) were only designed for the harder black &quot;wax&quot; records. A later reproducer would shave down the grooves very fast, and the sound would be lost forever.

In late 1888, metallic soaps were tried. At first, a lead stearate was used, but in the summer months, these records started to sweat and decompose. In 1889, Aylsworth developed an aluminum wax, using acetate of alumina and stearic acid with sodium hydroxide added as a saponifying agent. It was found these records were much more durable. Problems arose, however, since there was no tempering agent and hot weather caused these records to decompose. Two problems contributed to this, stearic quality varied from different makers; Aylsworth purchased some from Procter &amp; Gamble and found it contained too much oleic acid. Stearic acid without a tempering agent takes on moisture, and after many experiments, it was found that Ceresine was ideal. To make the wax hard, sodium carbonate was added. Even so, a few batches of records still had problems and became fogged. The fog problem arose from acetic acid left in the wax and was solved when higher temperatures were used to make sure the acetic acid was boiled out of the wax. As such, the records from 1889 to 1894 are a reddish-brown color due to the long cooking time. By 1896, Edison started using hydrated alumina in place of acetate of alumina. The use of hydrated alumina (sheet aluminum dissolved in a mixture of sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and distilled water) made better records, and the wax could be manufactured in a shorter period of time. Using hydrated alumina resulted in more desirable blanks, with fewer defects and shorter production time.

The Columbia Phonograph Company used Edison recording blanks until 1894. The North American Phonograph Company was dissolved in the fall of 1894, and Edison quit supplying blanks to Columbia, who had purchased 70,000 blanks from 1889 to 1894. Columbia was frantic to find a solution to make cylinder blanks in-house, and the recipe for making Edison&#x27;s wax was a well-kept secret. Thomas MacDonald experimented with wax alloys with poor results: the records fogged or decomposed in the summer, just like the early Edison blanks. The Columbia company had a deadline to either supply recordings, or have their contracts canceled and be sued for loss of records. Columbia resorted to hiring old Edison Phonograph Works employees, such as Mr. Storms, in order to learn their secrets. Unfortunately for Columbia, the names of the components used by Edison were not labeled with ingredients but were instead indicated by number (i.e. 1, 2, 3) keeping the identities of these components a secret. Paraffin, ceresine, and ozokerite all look similar, making the tempering agent even more difficult to identifify by the wax mixer. Wax mixers were given instructions on how much of each numbered component to put in the mixture, and how to process it, but no idea as to what the ingredients actually were. It took over a year for Columbia to come up with the formula for cylinders. Columbia placed an ad in the Soap Makers&#x27; Journal for a practical man to work with metallic soaps. Adolph Melzer, a soap manufacturer from Evansville, Indiana took the job. Melzer devised a formula comparable to Edison&#x27;s with the exception of the tempering agent (using cocinic acid, derived from coconut oil instead.)

In 1901 The Gold Molded (originally spelled Moulded) process was perfected for commercial use by Thomas Edison and Jonas Aylsworth (Edison&#x27;s Chemist) with input from Walter Miller, the Recording Manager of Edison Records. This discussion was gleaned from facts provided by Walter Miller, Jonas Aylsworth, Thomas Edison, Adolphe Melzer, and Charles Wurth.

At first, no method of mass production was available for cylinder records. Copies were made by having the artist play over and over or by hooking two machines together with rubber tubing (one with a master cylinder and the other a blank) or copying the sound mechanically. By the late 1890s, an improved mechanical duplicator, the pantograph, was developed which used mechanical linkage. One mandrel had a playback stylus and the other for recording, while weights and springs were used to adjust the tension between the styli to control recording volume and tracking.
The Edison team experimented with Vacuum Deposited Gold masters as early as 1888, and it has been reported that some brown wax records were molded, although this is unproven. The Edison Record, &quot;Fisher Maiden&quot;, was an early record that was experimented with for the process. The 1888 experiments were not successful due to the fact the grooves of the cylinders were square, and the sound waves were saw-tooth-shaped and deep. The records came out scratchy and it was very time-consuming.

The Gold Molded process involved taking a wax master and putting it in a vacuum chamber. The master record was put on a spinning mandrel, a pump removes the air from a glass bell jar, and two pieces of gold leaf were attached to an induction coil. Electrical current was applied, and a magnet was spun around the outside to turn the mandrel, and the gold vaporized applying a very thin coating on the master. This master was put on a motor in a plating tank and copper was used to back the gold. The master record was melted, then taken out of the mold to reveal a negative of the grooves in the metal. The master cylinder had to have the wider feed as the grooves shrink in length through each process. The master mold is used to create &quot;mothers&quot; and these are then further processed to make working molds.

The Gold molded record used an aluminum-based wax, like the post-1896 Edison brown wax. However, carnauba wax was added, as well as pine tar and lampblack resulting in a black, shiny, durable record. The molds with mandrels placed in the center were heated and dipped in a tank of the molten wax. These were removed and trimmed while still hot and put on a table then put in lukewarm water. The water caused the records to shrink in diameter so that they could be removed. The records were then trimmed, dried and cleaned, then later put on warm mandrels for 2 hours where they shrank evenly. Jonas Aylsworth developed this formula.

In 1908, Edison introduced Amberol Records which had a playing time of just over 4 minutes. The process of making the finished record was essentially the same as the Gold Molded records, however, a harder wax compound was used. In 1912, celluloid was used in place of wax, and the name was changed to Blue Amberol, as the dye was blue. What differed from earlier process was that a steam jacketed mold with an air bladder in the center was used. Celluloid tubing was put in the mold and the end gate was closed. The rubber bladder expanded the celluloid to the side of the heated mold and printed the negative record in positive on the celluloid. The bladder was then deflated, and cold air was used to shrink the tubing so the celluloid print could be removed. The printed tubing was put in a plaster filler. When the plaster was hard the cylinders were then baked in an oven, then ribs made on the inside of the plaster with knives. The records were cleaned and then packaged.

== Edison disc records ==


In October 1912 the Edison Diamond Disc Record was introduced. Edison Laboratories had been experimenting with disc records for some 3 years, as the general public seemed to prefer them to cylinders. The thick Edison Discs recorded the sound vertically in the groove at a rate of 150 grooves-per-inch (GPI) rather than the typical laterally-cut groove of around 100 GPI, which gave Edison discs a longer playing time (up to five minutes) than laterals and could only be played to their full advantage on Edison Diamond Disc Phonographs. This combination produced audio fidelity superior to any other home record playing system of the time. However, Edison Discs and phonographs were more expensive than their competitors&#x27;. This, together with the incompatibility of the Edison system with other discs and machines, had an adverse effect on Edison&#x27;s market share. Nonetheless, Edison Discs for a time became the third best selling brand in the United States, behind Victor and Columbia Records.
With World War I various materials used in Edison Discs came in short supply, and many discs pressed during the war were made hastily and with inferior materials, notably a reformulated phenolic finishing varnish that was introduced when European chemical supplies were cut off. This resulted in problems with surface noise even on new records, and Edison&#x27;s market share shrank.

Prior to the war Edison Records started a marketing campaign, hiring prominent singers and vaudeville performers to perform alongside and alternating with Edison records of their performances played on top-of-the-line &quot;Laboratory Model&quot; Edison Diamond Disc Phonographs. At various stages during the performances, all lights in the theater would be darkened and the audience challenged to guess if what they were hearing was live or recorded; accounts often said that much of the audience was astonished when the lights went back up to reveal only the Edison Phonograph on stage. According to a book published by the Edison company titled &quot;Composers and Artists whose Art is Re-Created by Edison&#x27;s New Art&quot; (ca. 1920), the first such comparison test or &quot;tone test&quot; as Edison copywriters referred to them, took place at Carnegie Hall on April 28, 1916, with Marie Rappold of the Metropolitan Opera providing the live vocal performance.

After the war, disc quality improved substantially as better quality ingredients became available again, and in the brief postwar boom Edison regained status in the industry. Sales for Edison discs peaked in 1920, but declined incrementally thereafter. In 1926, an attempt at reviving interest in the Edison Disc was with a 450-GPI long-playing disc, acoustically recorded and still spinning at 80 rpm, with times of 24 minutes per disc and 40 for a disc, but problems occurred (notably with broken groove walls and overall low volume, often only 40% of that of the regular discs), and the disc failed. In August 1927, discs began to be electrically recorded, making Edison the last major label to adopt electrical recording (over two years after Victor, Columbia, and Brunswick had converted from acoustical recording). Concurrently, Edison tried to freshen its catalogues by recording popular dance bands such as those of B. A. Rolfe and Harry Reser (whose &quot;Six Jumping Jacks&quot; group appeared on Edison as &quot;Earl Oliver&#x27;s Jazz Babies&quot;), the Goldman Band conducted by founder Edwin Franko Goldman, jazz performers Eva Taylor and Clarence Williams, and radio personalities like Vaughn De Leath and &quot;The Radio Franks&quot; (Frank Bessinger and Frank Wright). Classical performers who became Edison artists in the late 1920s included pianists E. Robert Schmitz and Moriz Rosenthal, violinists Arcadie Birkenholz and Erna Rubinstein, the Roth Quartet, tenors José Mojica and Giovanni Martinelli, and baritone Mario Basiola. Despite these efforts and constant experimentation at the Edison plant and their New York studio (including moving from 79 Fifth Avenue to more modern premises at 261 Fifth Avenue in early 1929), record sales and morale continued to drop – in fact, one Edison executive later asserted that Edison discs had lost money from the beginning – and although Edison Diamond Discs were available from dealers until the company left the record business in late October 1929, the last vertically cut direct masters were recorded in the early summer of that year.

In 1928 the Edison company began plans for making &quot;Needle Cut&quot; records; by which they meant standard lateral cut discs like the &quot;78s&quot; marketed by almost every other company of the time. Although several hundred lateral cut masters and stampers had been made by January 1929, the first &quot;Needle Cut&quot; discs were not released until August, and new titles were issued at a rate of only a few at a time each week for ten weeks before the company ceased record sales, thus only about 100 titles ever commercially appeared. The audio fidelity was often comparable to the best of other record companies of the time, but they sold poorly not only because Edison&#x27;s market share had declined to the point where it was no longer one of the leading companies and Edison had few distributors compared to leaders like Victor, Columbia, and Brunswick, but also because their brief existence did not allow them to establish any kind of market presence.

After Edison Records closed down in October 1929, many of the employees were transferred to manufacturing radios. Edison&#x27;s remaining wax masters and thousands of metal master molds, including unissued experimental recordings dating to several years before Diamond Discs were commercially introduced (many in a never-released format), were purchased by Henry Ford, and became part of the collection of the Henry Ford Museum. They were recently deaccessioned by the museum and sent to the Edison Historic Site (National Park Service) in New Jersey. Some of the Edison catalogue is in the public domain and available for download at the Library of Congress website.

<doc id="248871" wikidata="Q622032" url="?curid=248871" title="Paphlagonia">
<text>Paphlagonia (; , &quot;Paflagonía&quot;; ) was an ancient region on the Black Sea coast of north-central Anatolia, situated between Bithynia to the west and Pontus to the east, and separated from Phrygia (later, Galatia) by a prolongation to the east of the Bithynian Olympus. According to Strabo, the region was bounded by the river Parthenius to the west and the Halys River to the east. 
&quot;Paphlagonia&quot; was said to be named after Paphlagon, a son of the mythical Phineus.

==Location==
The greater part of Paphlagonia is a rugged mountainous country, but it contains fertile valleys and produces a great abundance of hazelnuts and fruit – particularly plums, cherries and pears. The mountains are clothed with dense forests, notable for the quantity of boxwood that they furnish. Hence, its coasts were occupied by Greeks from an early period. Among these, the flourishing city of Sinope, founded by colonists from Miletus in ca. 630 BC, stood pre-eminent. Amastris, a few miles east of the Parthenius river, became important under the rule of the Macedonian monarchs; while Amisus, a colony of Sinope situated a short distance east of the Halys river (and therefore not strictly in Paphlagonia as defined by Strabo), grew to become almost a rival of its parent city.

The most considerable towns of the interior were Gangra – in ancient times the capital of the Paphlagonian kings, afterwards called Germanicopolis, situated near the frontier of Galatia – and Pompeiopolis, in the valley of the Amnias river, near extensive mines of the mineral called by Strabo &quot;sandarake&quot; (red arsenic or arsenic sulfide), largely exported from Sinope.

==History==
In the time of the Hittites, Paphlagonia was inhabited by the Kashka people, whose exact ethnic relation to the Paphlagonians is uncertain. It seems perhaps that they were related to the people of the adjoining country, Cappadocia, who were speakers of one of the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European languages. Their language would appear, from Strabo&#x27;s testimony, to have been distinctive.
The Paphlagonians were one of the most ancient nations of Anatolia and were listed among the allies of the Trojans in the Trojan War (ca. 1200 BC or 1250 BC), where their king Pylaemenes and his son Harpalion perished (&quot;Iliad&quot;, ii. 851–857). According to Homer and Livy, a group of Paphlagonians, called the Enetoi in Greek, were expelled from their homeland during a revolution. With a group of defeated Trojans under the leadership of the Trojan prince Antenor, they emigrated to the northern end of the Adriatic coast and later merged with indigenous Euganei, giving the name Venetia to the area they settled.

Paphlagonians were mentioned by Herodotus among the peoples conquered by Croesus, and they sent an important contingent to the army of Xerxes in 480 BC. Xenophon speaks of them as being governed by a prince of their own, without any reference to the neighboring satraps, a freedom perhaps due to the nature of their country, with its lofty mountain ranges and difficult passes. All these rulers appear to have borne the name &quot;Pylaimenes&quot; as a sign that they claimed descent from the chieftain of that name who figures in the Iliad as leader of the Paphlagonians.

===Under the Kingdom of Pontus===
At a later period, Paphlagonia passed under the control of the Macedonian kings, and after the death of Alexander the Great, it was assigned, together with Cappadocia and Mysia, to Eumenes. However, it continued to be governed by native princes until it was absorbed by the encroaching power of Pontus. The rulers of that dynasty became masters of the greater part of Paphlagonia as early as the reign of Mithridates Ctistes (302–266 BC), but it was not until 183 BC that Pharnaces reduced the Greek city of Sinope under their control. From that time, the whole province was incorporated into the kingdom of Pontus until the fall of Mithridates (65 BC).

===Roman and Byzantine empires===
Pompey united the coastal districts of Paphlagonia, along with the greater part of Pontus, with the Roman province of Bithynia et Pontus, but left the interior of the country under the native princes, until the dynasty became extinct and the whole country was incorporated into the Roman Empire. The name was still retained by geographers, though its boundaries are not distinctly defined by the geographer Claudius Ptolemy. Paphlagonia reappeared as a separate province in the 5th century AD (Hierocles, &quot;Synecdemus&quot; c. 33). In the 7th century it became part of the theme of Opsikion, and later of the Bucellarian Theme, before being split off c. 820 to form a separate province once again. Under the Byzantine Empire, Greeks often disparaged Paphlagonians as crooks, particularly in the 10th to 12th centuries. During this period, the high profile of Paphlagonians in positions of power, such as court eunuchs, often attracted backlash from the rest of society.

<text>The Battle of Windsor was a short-lived campaign in the eastern Michigan area of the United States and the Windsor area of Upper Canada. A group of men on both sides of the border, calling themselves &quot;Patriots&quot;, formed small militias in 1837 with the intention of seizing the Southern Ontario peninsula between the Detroit and Niagara Rivers and extending American-style government to Canada. They based groups in Michigan at Fort Gratiot (present Port Huron), Mount Clemens, Detroit, and Gibraltar. The Patriots were defeated by British and American government forces, respectively.

==Beginnings==
In December 1837, Thomas Jefferson Sutherland was commissioned by the rebellion leaders on Navy Island in the Niagara River to head to Detroit to raise a force there. After the Navy Island base was evacuated, other Patriots came to Detroit. Public meetings were held in Detroit and an invasion force was organized. Men came to Detroit from as far away as Illinois and Kentucky to join the movement. Concerned that they would seize the U.S. arsenal at Fort Gratiot, U.S. General Hugh Brady ordered the weapons removed by boat. The steamship, however, became stuck in the ice at St. Clair, Michigan, and the journey to Detroit had to be completed by wagon. On January 5, 1838, the Detroit jail was raided and the Patriots seized the 450 muskets which had been stored there to keep them away from the rebels. The rebels were reported to have later stolen another 200 weapons from the unsecured office of the U.S. marshal in Detroit, perhaps with his help.

==Schooner &quot;Ann&quot;==
The schooner &quot;Ann&quot; was seized by the Patriots on January 8 and sailed to Gibraltar, Michigan. The governor of Michigan, Stevens T. Mason, along with a detachment of 200 militiamen, pursued them in two steamships. A hundred Canadian militia also followed in the steamer &quot;Alliance&quot;. Mason met with the Patriot leaders at Gibraltar, but the captured steamship &quot;Ann&quot; continued on to near Fort Malden on the Canadian shore. On January 9, the Patriots began shelling Malden and the town of Amherstburg from the &quot;Ann&quot;. The Canadian militia took up positions in the town while the Patriots moved 300 men onto the Canadian Bois Blanc Island opposite the town. The Canadian militia opened fire on the schooner when it tried to reach the island. The Canadians shot several of the ship crew and damaged the sails and rigging. The ship drifted until it ran aground, at which point the Canadian militia boarded it, encountered no resistance and captured the Patriot crew. The remaining Patriot forces quit Bois Blanc for the safety of the American side of the river. Several of the Patriots were wounded, a few killed, and the Canadians captured 300 muskets, two cannon, 10 kegs of gunpowder and various accoutrements.

After losing the &quot;Ann&quot;, the Patriots stole another ship, the steamer &quot;Little Erie&quot;. The head of the Detroit militia, himself, tried to prevent the boat leaving at swordpoint and the U.S. marshal&#x27;s force was reported to have fired into the air, but the local crowd supported the Patriot movement and the boat was taken to Gibraltar. On January 27, three companies of U.S. troops arrived from Buffalo aboard the steamer &quot;Robert Fulton&quot; to help calm the area. Governor Mason met with the Patriots at Gibraltar on February 12, again to no avail. In fact, that same day, Patriots raided the U.S. arsenal in Dearborn, Michigan, stealing hundreds of weapons. This group of weapons was soon recovered, having been hidden near a tavern in Detroit.

==Fighting Island and Pelee Island==
On February 24, 1838, a group of Patriots began assembling on Fighting Island on the Canadian side of the Detroit River. Supplies were ferried over from Detroit and some 400 Patriots from Cleveland joined the Detroit area men. The larger force of 600 Cleveland men occupied Pelee Island at the same time. It was reported that the Patriots had only 50 muskets and one dismounted cannon among them on the island. The U.S. general informed his British counterpart of the assembly, announcing that he would wait for the Patriots to break up and arrest them upon their return for violation of American neutrality laws. The British commandant replied that he would attack the Patriot camp and pursue them into the United States. This reply led General Brady to order a line of red flags to be placed in the ice on the river marking the border. He deployed his men with orders to shoot any British soldiers passing the line.

The British regulars, artillery and Canadian militia attacked at daybreak of February 25. The British force proceeded across the ice to capture the island but did not cross the border. The U.S. forces briefly detained a few Patriots but soon released them. Casualties are uncertain, with the British commander claiming no deaths on either side but other reports claiming 5 British dead and 15 wounded and at least 5 Patriots wounded, some of whom required amputations of their arms.

On March 23, in a much bloodier engagement, a British and Canadian force drove the Patriots from Pelee Island.

==Waiting==
After the engagements at Fighting Island and Pelee Island, U.S. and Canadian troops patrolled their sides of the border, and little Patriot Hunter activity occurred in the Detroit-Windsor area. Larger battles occurred along the St. Lawrence and at Short Hills with large Patriot losses. The Patriots were not yet finished, however. Activity around Detroit picked up again with the return of winter.

==Renewed action==
On November 24, 1838, General Brady on the steamer &quot;Illinois&quot; captured a Patriot ship with 250 weapons and a supply of ammunition. He returned to Detroit to find that his own troops&#x27; weapons had been stolen from city hall in his absence. The theft was soon solved, and the weapons were recovered after two days. The Hunter Lodge at Port Huron with its Sarnia counterparts across the river planned an invasion at the beginning of December, but reinforcements from Detroit did not arrive. British officials in Canada became aware of the plot and deployed troops and artillery along that section of the border, ending the plan. Throughout November, some 300 Ohio and Pennsylvania Patriots assembled at a field south of the city of Detroit, joining a couple hundred locals and Canadians.

On December 4, 1838, at 2 am, the Patriots crossed the Detroit River into Canada on a captured steamboat, the &quot;Champlain&quot;, and engaged in an unsuccessful battle at Windsor where the Patriots set the British barracks on fire, burned the steamer &quot;Thames&quot; and several houses, and killed four militiamen before taking positions at the Baby farm, which contained a large orchard. Only 20 militia were billeted at Windsor, a small town of around 300, while some miles further south at Sandwich and Amherstburg were the bulk of the 500 militia and regulars.

At about 7 am, a 60-man company of Canadian militia commanded by Arthur Rankin from Sandwich repelled the invasion before the regulars arrived and captured several Patriots. The militia pushed the Patriots out of the orchard and pursued them through the town. The Patriots then fled in several directions, some returning to their steamer to free the 18 prisoners they had taken. Colonel John Prince arrived after the rout (9:30 am) and took command. Prince then moved his troops back to Sandwich, fearing another attack there.

At 1:30 pm, a company of British regulars from the 34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot with a six-pound cannon and 20 mounted Aboriginals arrived at Sandwich and continued north to Windsor. Prince decided to follow with his 400 militiamen. However, all of the Patriots had made their escape by this time, and only one of them was captured. Prince ordered that four prisoners be immediately shot without having been tried in court. The British cannon fired some shots at Patriots fleeing in stolen canoes, hitting one in the arm. The U.S. steamer &quot;Erie&quot; carrying Detroit militia captured some of the Patriots but soon released them on U.S. soil.

==Legacy==

In 1966, the Archaeological and Historic Sites Board of Ontario erected a Provincial Military plaque on the grounds of the Hiram Walker Historical Museum: 

==Aftermath==

After the second pursuit, Colonel Prince lined up another seven prisoners in front of the burned barracks and ordered them shot as well. Influential local citizens dissuaded him from this action. Local citizens later published a circular against Prince, leading one of them, William R. Wood, to have to duel him. Prince survived the duel unharmed. A court martial mostly exonerated him, but the matter made its way to the floor of Parliament. No censure occurred there either as the Duke of Wellington steered the discussion away from Prince to the general topic of the need to use regular troops to defend Canada from American invasion.

Joshua Doan of Sparta, Upper Canada, was among the several dozen Hunter Patriots captured in Windsor, and he was later hanged for treason. Other were sentenced to be transported to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, others to Bermuda.

The Michigan militia remained stationed at the United States Arsenal in Dearborn, and were used to track down remaining groups of Patriots in the area. This conflict led to the reorganization of the Michigan militia because its structure was found to be insufficient to deal with such rebellions. The U.S. Army constructed Fort Wayne in Detroit in 1842 to strengthen U.S. defenses as a counter to Fort Malden in Amherstburg, rebuilt during the war. The blockhouses built by the British on Bois Blanc Island during the war were manned until the 1850s.

These events at Windsor formed the last military action of the rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada of 1837–38.

An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate the Battle of Windsor&#x27;s role in Ontario&#x27;s heritage.

<text>Kopspijkers is a talk show that ran on the Dutch public television from 1995 to 2005 (first named Spijkers). A recipient, in 2003, of the annual &quot;Zilveren Nipkow&quot; best-show award from Dutch television critics, the programme was produced by the left-of-centre public broadcaster VARA. It was hosted by , hence the title.

Humorous in style, the show was particularly noted for its satirical sketches. Until 2001 it was &#x27;normal&#x27; cabaret, but in September 2001 (which happened to be the week of the 9/11 terrorist attacks) the show started with imitations of famous people. These were much like those featured in the British TV programme &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, but used real actors. Political leaders like Jan Peter Balkenende, Wouter Bos and Gerrit Zalm were frequently impersonated. At first only Dutch people were impersonated, later also foreign celebrities (including Tony Blair, Nelson Mandela, John Kerry and Viktor Yushchenko) were impersonated. In recent episodes even historical characters, like Napoleon Bonaparte, Anne Frank, Plato and Joseph Stalin were imitated. &quot;Kopspijkers&quot; was amongst the most viewed programmes in the Netherlands. At the start of the Iraq War one of their sketches &quot;BZN in Baghdad&quot;, went viral on the internet in the English-speaking world, and included BZN impersonators chroma-keyed into newsreel footage of combat and the toppling of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s statue

On several occasions, the imitations have caused controversies. The first imitation episode showed sensationalist TV presenter Willibrord Frequin chasing Osama bin Laden asking &quot;why he had been so cowardly&quot; and &quot;why he sent thousands of people into death&quot;. Pim Fortuyn was often imitated, which led to accusations against Kopspijkers after he was assassinated. In November 2003 Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende and Minister Piet Hein Donner complained about the &#x27;tasteless&#x27; imitations of members of the royal family. Queen Beatrix later said she had no problems with being imitated. In 2005, Jack Spijkerman decided to cancel his contract with VARA and sign with the newly formed channel Talpa. Though Spijkerman intended to finish the running season, VARA cut it short and cancelled the 4 remaining shows. Spijkerman made a similar (but commonly deemed of less quality) show on Talpa, called but after bankruptcy of the channel it disappeared of the Dutch TV.

In 2004 similar shows were broadcast in Germany and Belgium, but they weren&#x27;t very popular.

<doc id="248888" wikidata="Q394641" url="?curid=248888" title="Ƒ">
<text>The letter F with hook (uppercase Ƒ, lowercase: ƒ) is a letter of the Latin script, based on the italic form of f; or on its regular form with a descender hook added. A very similar-looking letter, (a dotless &quot;j&quot; with a hook and a horizontal stroke), is used in the IPA for a voiced palatal implosive.

== Regular ==
Ƒ is used in writing the Ewe language in a straight form to represent the sound , as distinct from the letter F, which represents an . It is also used in the Avatime, Lelemi, Nyangbo-Tafi, and Waci languages.

== Italic ==
The minuscule italic &quot;ƒ&quot;, also called the florin sign, is used as a symbol for several currencies, including the former Dutch guilder, the Aruban florin, and the Netherlands Antillean guilder. It can be found as italic in non-italic fonts.

The italic &quot;ƒ&quot; has been used to denote mathematical functions, or to indicate aperture in photography (e.g. ƒ/2.8) in place of the more common italic &quot;f&quot; (in serif fonts) or oblique &quot;f&quot; (in sans-serif fonts). It can be represented with .

==Appearance in computer fonts==
Older fonts and character encodings included only the minuscule form for its use as an abbreviation. Unicode includes both the majuscule and the minuscule.
Because of its origin, the italic &quot;ƒ&quot; (f with a hook) looks exactly like the italic &quot;f&quot; (f) in some typefaces.
Ƒ and ƒ occupy code points and in Unicode respectively, and may be entered by appropriate input methods.

On a computer running Microsoft Windows and using the Windows-1252 character encoding, the minuscule can be input using or .

The character has been used on the Macintosh to mean folder, in particular as part of a folder name. For example, the game &quot;Bugdom&quot;, when included on some Mac OS 9 installations, was contained in a folder called &quot;Bugdom ƒ&quot;. This usage has died out with the advent of Mac OS X. The Macintosh Programmer&#x27;s Workshop also used the character to indicate software dependencies, from which the folder usage derived (the folder contained the files required to run the program). The character is created on the Macintosh by pressing .

The character frequently appears in Japanese mojibake. The lead byte 0x83 appears before a Katakana character in Shift JIS, but if interpreted as Windows-1252 encoding, it becomes the ƒ character.

<text>The phrase per mille () indicates parts per thousand. The associated symbol is , similar to a per cent sign but with an extra zero in the divisor.

Major dictionaries do not agree on the spelling, giving other options of per mil, per mill, permil, permill, permille. 

The word  is the cognate in Dutch, German, Finnish and Swedish, and is sometimes seen as a loanword in English with the same meaning as &quot;per mille&quot;.

The symbol is included in the General Punctuation block of Unicode at . There is also an Arabic-Indic per mille sign at .

==Examples==
===Blood alcohol concentration===

Promille and permille are likely best known as shorthand terms for Blood Alcohol Concentration, where 1 promille corresponds to 1 gram of alcohol per liter of blood. Promille is used in the legal limits of blood-alcohol content for driving a road vehicle in some countries: for example: 0.5‰ or 0.8‰.

===Cost per mille===
====Sales and marketing====

Cost per mille (CPM), the price of 1000 units, may be used for views of banner and display advertising, and for emails delivered by email service providers.

====Insurance====
In UK insurance usage, the cost per mille is the rate per £1000 of insured value. In India, the premium per mille is the rate expressed as thousandths of the sum assured.

===Gradients===
Gradients (in some countries in Europe) may be expressed as mm/m or m/km, and written with the per mille symbol.

===Isotope ratios===
Per mille may be used to express stable-isotope ratios—for example: &quot;δ13C was measured at −3.5‰&quot;

===Taxation===
====Charity fraction====
In Italy, it is possible to nominate a charity or charities to receive &quot;five per mille&quot; (5‰) of personal taxation payments.
====Property tax====

Property taxation rates may be expressed as the &quot;millage rate&quot; (U.S.) or &quot;mill rate&quot; (Canada), from mill (currency), one thousandth of a dollar.

===Quantile===

Permille may also be used to express a 1000-quantile (&quot;999th permille&quot;), but this usage is rare and largely obsolete. Modern publications instead use fractional percentiles (&quot;99.9th percentile&quot;).

===Salinity===

Seawater salinity is often expressed per mille. Average marine salinity is about 35 parts per thousand or 35‰ (3.5%).

* Percentage point difference of 1 part in 100
* Percentage (%) 1 part in 100
* Basis point (bp) difference of 1 part in 10,000

<text>The grapheme Š, š (S with caron) is used in various contexts representing the sh sound like in the word &quot;show&quot;, usually denoting the voiceless postalveolar fricative /ʃ/ or similar voiceless retroflex fricative /ʂ/. In the International Phonetic Alphabet this sound is denoted with ʃ or ʂ, but the lowercase š is used in the Americanist phonetic notation, as well as in the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet. 
It represents the same sound as the Turkic letter Ş and the Romanian letter Ș (S-comma), the Hebrew and Yiddish letter ש, the Ge&#x27;ez (Ethiopic) letter ሠ, the Cyrillic letter Ш, the Arabic letter ش, and the Armenian letter Շ(շ).

For use in computer systems, &quot;Š&quot; and &quot;š&quot; are at Unicode codepoints U+0160 and U+0161 (Alt 0138 and Alt 0154 for input), respectively. In HTML code, the entities codice_1 and codice_2 can also be used to represent the characters.

==Primary usage==
The symbol originates with the 15th-century Czech alphabet that was introduced by the reforms of Jan Hus. From there, it was first adopted into the Croatian alphabet by Ljudevit Gaj in 1830 to represent the same sound, and from there on into other orthographies, such as Latvian, Lithuanian, Slovak, Slovene, Karelian, Sami, Veps and Sorbian.

Some orthographies such as Bulgarian Cyrillic, Macedonian Cyrillic, and Serbian Cyrillic use the &quot;ш&quot; letter, which represents the sound that &quot;š&quot; would represent in Latin alphabets. Moreover, Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian, and Montenegrin standard languages adopted Gaj&#x27;s Croatian alphabet alongside Cyrillic thereby adopting &quot;š&quot;, while the same alphabet is used for Romanization of Macedonian. Certain variants of Belarusian Latin and Bulgarian Latin also use the letter.

In Finnish and Estonian, &quot;š&quot; occurs only in loanwords.

Polish and Hungarian do not use &quot;š&quot;. Polish uses the digraph &quot;sz&quot;. Hungarian uses the basic Latin letter &quot;s&quot; and uses the digraph &quot;sz&quot; as equivalent to most other languages that use &quot;s&quot;.

Outside Europe, Syriac Latin adopted the letter but it, alongside other letters with diacritics, is rarely used. The alphabet is not used natively to write the language for which the Syriac alphabet is used instead.

The letter is also used in Lakota, Cheyenne, Myaamia and Cree (in dialects such as Moose Cree), Classical Malay (until end of 19th century) and some African languages such as Northern Sotho and Songhay. It is used in the Persian Latin (Rumi) alphabet, equivalent to ش.

==Transliteration==
The symbol is also used as the romanization of Cyrillic ш in ISO 9 and scientific transliteration and deployed in the Latinic writing systems of Macedonian, Bulgarian, Serbian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Bashkir. It is also used in some systems of transliterating Georgian to represent ().

In addition, the grapheme transliterates cuneiform orthography of Sumerian and Akkadian or , and (based on Akkadian orthography) the Hittite phoneme, as well as the phoneme of Semitic languages, transliterating shin (Phoenician and its descendants), the direct predecessor of Cyrillic ш.

<doc id="248903" wikidata="Q1262690" url="?curid=248903" title="Duane Chapman">
<text>Duane Chapman (born February 2, 1953), also known as Dog the Bounty Hunter, is an American television personality, bounty hunter, and former bail bondsman.

Chapman came to international notice as a bounty hunter for his successful capture of Max Factor heir Andrew Luster in Mexico in 2003 and, the following year, was given his own series, &quot;Dog the Bounty Hunter&quot; (2004–2012), on A&amp;E. After &quot;Dog the Bounty Hunter&quot; ended, Chapman appeared in &quot;Dog and Beth: On the Hunt&quot; (2013–2015), a similarly formatted TV show, alongside his wife and business partner, the late Beth Chapman, on CMT. His latest series, &quot;Dog&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, aired on WGN America in late 2019.

==Early life==

=== Childhood ===
Chapman was born February 2, 1953, in Denver, Colorado to Wesley Duane Chapman (1930 – 2000), a Korean War veteran, and Barbara Darlene Chapman (nee Cowell; 1934 – 1994), a Sunday school teacher associated with the Assemblies of God USA. His father was a welder but changed careers later in life, becoming a bail bondsman after Chapman became one. Chapman had stated that his father was physically abusive.

Chapman has three siblings: Jolene, Michael, and Paula. Though Chapman has claimed to have Native American heritage, records only support that he is of European heritage.

At the age of 15, Chapman joined the Devils Diciples, an outlaw motorcycle club, and ran away from home.

=== Murder of Jerry Bowers Oliver ===
In the late hours of September 15, 1976, 23-year-old Chapman, 22-year-old Donald Kuykendall, 17-year-old Cheryl Fisher, and 19-year-old Ruben Garza armed themselves and drove to 1072 South Prairie Drive, the home of Jerry Bowers Oliver, a 34-year-old resident of Pampa, Texas. Oliver was known to sell marijuana and the group planned to rob him. Kuykendall entered Oliver&#x27;s home while Chapman, Fisher, and Garza waited outside by their vehicle. Around 11:40 p.m., Kuykendall shot Oliver in the armpit at close range with a sawed-off shotgun and the group fled the scene. Police were called to Prairie Drive and Oliver, still conscious, gave officers Kuykendall and Chapman&#x27;s names. Oliver died on September 16, 1976, while undergoing emergency surgery at Northwest Texas Hospital in Amarillo, Texas, around 3:30 a.m.

Police arrived at Chapman&#x27;s residence at 501 Roberta Street on September 16, 1976 to arrest him. Chapman attempted to evade officers by leaving through the back door of his home but was caught and taken to the jail in Gray County. His bond was set at $10,000 (the equivalent of a $56,000 bond in 2024). Kuykendall, Fisher, and Garza were also arrested. Donnie Barton, who&#x27;d been with the group earlier that evening but did not go with them to Prairie Drive, told police the group had discussed their plan to steal marijuana from Oliver&#x27;s home in front of him and that they referred to Oliver, an African American, by the N word.

On July 22, 1977, a grand jury of seven men and five women found Chapman, Kuykendall, and Garza guilty of murder. Though Chapman was outside when Kuykendall shot Oliver, he had brought his own weapon and supplied Kuykendall with shotgun cartridges and for that, the jury found him culpable. Fisher avoided going to trial by pleading guilty the week prior. Chapman was given a five-year prison sentence. He served 18 months at the Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas before being paroled.

In a 2007 interview with Fox News, Chapman said that while serving his sentence, he tackled an inmate about to be shot for attempting to escape, and a congratulatory remark by a corrections officer inspired him to become a bounty hunter later. As a result of his felony conviction, Chapman is prohibited from owning firearms and has been refused entry to the United Kingdom.

==Career==
===Capture of Andrew Luster ===

On June 18, 2003, Chapman made international news by capturing Max Factor cosmetics heir Andrew Luster, who had fled the United States in the middle of his trial on charges of drugging and raping a number of women. Luster had been convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; on 86 counts, including multiple rape charges connected to assaults in 1996, 1997, and 2000. Chapman was assisted by his hunt team, which consisted of his son, Leland, and an associate, Tim Chapman (no relation). The three bounty hunters captured Luster in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where they had been living under assumed names. On their way to bring Luster to the San Diego jail, they were pulled over by Mexican police, and all four of them were jailed. Dog and Leland were arrested under suspicion of drug use. Once the authorities confirmed Luster&#x27;s identity, he was sent to California to face his 125-year sentence.

Chapman and his team, still in the Mexican jail, were initially denied bail, but after his wife Beth alerted the media and aroused public opinion in the United States, they were granted bail. Once out of jail on bail, they followed their attorney&#x27;s advice and fled the jurisdiction, thereby becoming international bail-jumpers. On September 14, 2006, days before the expiration of the statute of limitations, Chapman, along with his son Leland Chapman and associate Tim Chapman, were arrested by United States Marshals, and jailed in Honolulu on behalf of the Mexican government. Mexican authorities had charged all three with &quot;deprivation of liberty,&quot; involving the 2003 arrest of Andrew Luster, because bounty hunting is illegal in Mexico. Since they did not obtain permission to leave the country while out on bail in 2003, the Mexican Government declared the three Chapmans fugitives from justice and tried to get them extradited to Mexico for sentencing. After spending one night in the federal detention center in Honolulu, Chapman told reporters &quot;The federal marshals treated us with great respect. But let me tell you, you never want to go to a federal prison, because it&#x27;s terrible.&quot;

The next day, September 15, 2006, Chapman appeared in a packed Honolulu courtroom with his ankles shackled. Although the judge agreed that the men were not a significant flight risk, he ordered that each wear an electronic monitoring device around the ankle. The three men were released on bail ($300,000 for Duane Chapman, $100,000 each for Leland Chapman and Tim Chapman). Chapman&#x27;s lead attorney, Brook Hart, reportedly planned to argue that although the charge Chapman faced is a misdemeanor in Mexico, when translated into English, the charge of kidnapping became a felony under American law. Mexican authorities dismissed Hart&#x27;s claim and insisted that Chapman had, in fact, been charged with a felony. An extradition hearing was set for November 16, 2006.

Chapman has speculated that his arrest was due in part to a possible prisoner exchange agreement between the Mexican and American authorities. According to Chapman, the federal agents &quot;sold him out&quot;, by trading him in for a convicted Mexican drug lord. Duane, Leland, and Tim had their ankle bracelets removed so they could work. On October 11, 2006, reports surfaced of an open letter dated September 26, 2006, sent on Chapman&#x27;s behalf by 29 Republican Congressmen to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The letter stated the authors&#x27; opposition to Chapman&#x27;s extradition and requested that Rice deny Mexico&#x27;s request for same. Subsequently, on October 20, 2006, lawyers for Chapman stated the Mexican federal court had granted them an order halting the criminal case against the bounty hunter until further evidence and witness testimony was gathered. A court hearing was held on December 23, 2006. The original hearing was postponed due to a report from a lower court having not yet been received. The court heard both sides of the story then decided to recess. Court proceedings then started on January 16, 2007, and the court had until Tuesday, February 6, 2007, but the deadline was extended.

On February 16, 2007, a Mexican federal court ruled there was no reason not to try Chapman on the charge of deprivation of liberty in Mexico. In response, on February 23, Hawaii State Representatives Gene Ward, Karen Awana, Rida Cabanilla, Lynn Finnegan, Barbara Marumoto, Colleen Meyer, Kymberly Pine, Joe Bertram, Ken Ito, Marylin Lee, and John Mizuno introduced House Concurrent Resolution 50, &quot;Requesting the President of Mexico and the Second District Court of Guadalajara to drop extradition charges against TV Bounty Hunter, Duane &#x27;Dog&#x27; Chapman&quot;. The resolution was passed by the International Affairs committee on March 7.

During this time, Chapman, along with his new attorney, William C. Bollard, appeared on numerous media shows. Some of these include: &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;Greta Van Susteren&quot;, &quot;Mark and Mercedez Morning Show&quot; on Mix 94.1 KMXB in Las Vegas, &quot;The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet&quot; on WFLD, Fox 6 News San Diego, &quot;The Glenn Beck Program&quot;, and &quot;THE 9 on Yahoo!&quot;. Honolulu news outlet KHNL reported on August 1, 2007, the arrest warrant issued for Chapman and his associates might be invalidated, as a Mexican court had found the statute of limitations regarding the arrest had expired. The 15-page legal order was released in Spanish, and was translated and verified for legal accuracy. On September 29, 2006, Chapman received permission to have the electronic monitoring device removed temporarily so that he could travel to the East Coast for previously planned appearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday 9/29/2006&quot;&gt; &#x27;Dog&#x27; Chapman released from ankle bracelet, USATODAY, September 29, 2006, 9:43am ET&lt;/ref&gt; On August 2, 2007, the First Criminal Court in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, dismissed all criminal charges pending against Duane, Leland, and Tim Chapman, on the grounds the statute of limitations had expired. The order effectively canceled all pending charges. The prosecution appealed the ruling; this is standard practice in Mexico, according to A&amp;E. On November 5, 2007, U.S. Magistrate Judge Barry Kurren dismissed the extradition attempt, saying that even though the cases were appealed, the trio are no longer charged with any crimes.

===&quot;Dog the Bounty Hunter&quot;===
Chapman, after decades of bounty hunting, was featured on &quot;Take This Job&quot;, a program about people with unusual occupations. This led him and the show&#x27;s production company to do a spin-off about his work in capturing bail fugitives, in particular Chapman&#x27;s efforts in hunting down Andrew Luster in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. After Luster&#x27;s jailing, Chapman was interviewed for the August 28, 2003, episode of the truTV television series&quot; Dominick Dunne&#x27;s Power, Privilege, and Justice&quot;. By now Chapman&#x27;s profile had come to the attention of the American public. It was during this time A&amp;E decided to create an ongoing reality series around his bounty hunting job. On August 30, 2004, the first series of &quot;Dog the Bounty Hunter&quot; made its television debut, running for eight seasons before being canceled in 2012. The theme song was performed by Ozzy Osbourne.

In early October 2007, Chapman gained negative public attention after a private phone conversation between him and his son, Tucker, was sold to the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;. The conversation was about the relationship his son was having with a black woman. During the recording, Chapman can be heard referring to his son&#x27;s girlfriend as a &quot;nigger&quot;, discussing the word use in his household, and expressing his disdain for interracial relationships. Once the tape was made public, A&amp;E announced it was suspending production of Chapman&#x27;s TV series pending an investigation. On October 31, 2007, Chapman issued a public apology, but on November 2, 2007, A&amp;E announced it was nonetheless removing the show from their schedule &quot;for the foreseeable future.&quot; On February 19, 2008, A&amp;E released a statement that said Chapman had &quot;taken and continues to take the appropriate steps in reaching out to several African American organizations in an effort to make amends for his private comments,&quot; and announced that Chapman&#x27;s TV show would return to production.

===&quot;Dog and Beth: On the Hunt&quot;===

On September 25, 2012, CMT announced it had ordered a new reality series which would begin airing in April 2013. The new series, titled &quot;Dog and Beth: On the Hunt&quot;, featured Chapman, his wife Beth, and Chapman&#x27;s son Leland visiting failing bail bond agencies across the country, giving them advice on how to turn their businesses around, and assisting in the capture of their most wanted fugitives.

The show&#x27;s pilot episode featured Chapman and his son Leland working together for the first time since Leland left the previous show in 2012. The show ran for three seasons, airing until its cancellation in 2016.

===&quot;Dog&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;===

In 2019, an additional spin-off featuring Dog and Beth called &quot;Dog&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, airing for a single season.

===&quot;Dog Unleashed&quot;===
His new series, &quot;Dog Unleashed&quot;, was canceled in 2021, before it aired on the streaming service Unleashed. In October 2021 the production company sued Chapman for breach of contract saying that the show canceled after Chapman allegedly made racist and homophobic outbursts and also illegally used a taser during a shoot for a show in Virginia. Chapman has denied the accusations made in the suit.

===Later work===
In September 2021, Chapman became involved in the manhunt for Brian Laundrie following the killing of Gabby Petito.

===Author===
In 2007, Chapman released his autobiography, &quot;You Can Run But You Can&#x27;t Hide&quot; (co-written with Laura Morton). The book debuted at #1 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list.

His second book, &quot;Where Mercy Is Shown, Mercy Is Given&quot; was published in 2010, also co-authored with Morton.

In 2024, Chapman released &quot;Nine Lives and Counting: A Bounty Hunter’s Journey to Faith, Hope, and Redemption&quot;.

===Other appearances===
*Chapman and Beth made appearances as themselves on the Canadian television series &quot;Corner Gas&quot; in 2008.

* In early 2022 Chapman competed on season 7 of The Masked Singer as “Armadillo” from “Team Good” he was eliminated on April 13, 2022 alongside Jennifer Holliday as “Miss Teddy” from “Team Cuddly”

== Personal life ==
Chapman&#x27;s first marriage was to LaFonda Sue Honeycutt by whom he has two children, Duane Lee Chapman II and Leland Blane Chapman. Both sons would go on to work with Chapman at Da&#x27;Kine Bail Bonds in Honolulu, Hawaii, and appear on TV alongside their father. LaFonda filed for divorce from Chapman in 1977, after he was charged with homicide. She remarried Jim Darnell and had two daughters, Hannah and Britney, with him.

His second marriage was to Ann Tegnell, with whom he has three children, Zebadiah Chapman, Wesley Chapman (born 1980), and James Robert &quot;J. R.&quot; Chapman (born 1982). They met in 1979, shortly after Chapman was released from prison. Tegnell was 17 years old when she became pregnant with Zebadiah and he feared that by having been intimate with a minor, he would be made to return to prison for violating his parole. To avoid potential legal ramifications, Chapman decided to propose to Tegnell, even though he did not love her. The two wed on August 22, 1979, in Colorado. Zebadiah was born prematurely on January 1, 1980 and died less than a month later. They divorced sometime after the birth of Wesley but later reconciled, resulting in her becoming pregnant with James. After they separated permanently, Ann was granted custody of Wesley and James and moved to Utah. Wesley was ultimately raised by his maternal grandmother, and both sons were kept from being able to communicate with Chapman. Wesley and James reunited with Chapman as adults.

His third marriage was to Lyssa Rae &quot;Big Lyssa&quot; Brittain (&quot;née&quot; Greene). The marriage was reportedly performed by a Native American chief in the Colorado mountains in 1982, and ended on November 20, 1991. The two had met just days prior in a bar, while Lyssa was still married to her husband, an Assemblies of God minister, though the two had since separated due to his infidelity. According to Chapman, he offered Lyssa $1,000 to have his child, to which she agreed. They had three children together, Barbara Katie Chapman (June 8, 1982 – May 19, 2006), Tucker Dee Chapman (September 8, 1983), and Lyssa Rae Chapman (June 10, 1987). The family lived in Denver, Colorado, in a home left to Chapman by his grandfather Mike, along with Duane Lee and Leland. According to Chapman&#x27;s daughter Lyssa, she and her siblings reportedly endured a hard childhood, with incidents of sexual abuse and substance abuse plaguing the family.

His fourth marriage was to Tawny Marie Chapman. The two met in 1988, after Chapman arrested her on a drug possession charge, and she subsequently became his secretary. The two married in 1992, separated in 1994, and officially divorced in 2002. The two had no children together, though Chapman&#x27;s children did refer to her as their mother during the couple’s relationship. In his autobiography, &quot;You Can Run But You Can&#x27;t Hide&quot;, Chapman referred to the marriage as &quot;a disaster from the start,&quot; alleging she was addicted to amphetamines.

His fifth marriage was to Alice Elizabeth &quot;Beth&quot; Barmore (&quot;née&quot; Smith; October 29, 1967 - June 26, 2019), with whom he had an on-again-off-again relationship, until the two married on May 20, 2006, at a Hilton hotel in Waikoloa Village, Hawaii. They had two children together, Bonnie Joanne Chapman (born December 16, 1998) and Garry Chapman (February 7, 2001), and Chapman adopted Beth&#x27;s daughter from her previous marriage, Cecily Barmore-Chapman (&quot;née&quot; Barmore; born June 19, 1993). Chapman was also able to help Beth locate and reconcile with her son, Dominic Davis (born 1985), who was born to her when she was a teenager and subsequently placed for adoption. Dog and Beth operated Da&#x27;Kine Bail Bonds together. Beth died on June 26, 2019, at The Queen&#x27;s Medical Center in Honolulu, as a result of throat cancer. She had been diagnosed with the disease in 2017. In 2021, their daughter Bonnie accused Chapman of having been unfaithful to Beth throughout their marriage.

On August 23, 2021, TMZ reported that Chapman was engaged to Francie Frane. The two reportedly met six months after Beth&#x27;s passing, and like Chapman, Frane had been recently widowed, having lost her husband, Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Frane in December 2018. They announced their engagement in May 2020 and married in Colorado on September 2, 2021.

Chapman has one child out of wedlock, his eldest child Christopher Michael Hecht (born 1972), who was born to his ex-girlfriend, Debbie White, while he was serving an 18-month prison sentence. Debbie kept her pregnancy from Chapman and died of suicide in 1978, leading the boy to be adopted by Keith and Gloria Hecht. Hecht has reportedly struggled with drug and alcohol addiction since at least 1991, and has a lengthy criminal history, including a history of hate crimes.

===Political views===
Chapman spoke out against changes to bail laws in New Jersey and Colorado at various times between 2017 and 2021, arguing such changes endangered the public by allowing release of violent criminals and also harmed victims of crime. In 2021, Chapman opposed Senate Bill 62 (SB21-062), introduced in the Colorado General Assembly. The bill sought to restrict bail bondsmen in the state from issuing surety bonds for individuals arrested for misdemeanors, low-level felonies, and certain drug offenses, instead allowing the accused to arrange for their own release through personal recognizance, the stated goal being to lower the number of inmates in Colorado prisons. The bill did not pass.

In September 2022, at the Christian evangelical “Opening the Heavens” conference, Chapman called President Biden &quot;little Hitler&quot; and &quot;that freak&quot; who &quot;stoled&quot; [sic] the 2020 election. He predicted that Republicans would sweep the 2022 midterms and that &quot;little Hitler&quot; President Biden might commit suicide just like Hitler did after being &quot;caught.&quot;

In April 2024, in a Fox News interview with Jesse Watters, Watters asked Chapman that if Donald Trump were re-elected as president of the United States, would Chapman like to be a &quot;deportation czar,&quot; referring to the population of illegal immigrants residing in the United States. Chapman said he &quot;would like a job like that.&quot;

=== Controversies ===
On November 2, 2007, Reuters reported that A&amp;E had made the decision to suspend production of the fifth season of &quot;Dog the Bounty Hunter&quot; after Chapman&#x27;s son Tucker sold a recording of a private phone conversation in which Chapman referred to Tucker&#x27;s girlfriend, an African American, as the N-word to the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;. Chapman addressed the controversy in 2007, saying that while he knew he should not have used a racial slur, that no black person had ever told him they were offended by his use of the word. He addressed it again in 2021, in an interview with &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; host Kevin Frazier, denying that he was racist and saying he &quot;had more black friends than Eminem.&quot;

On October 8, 2021, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Chapman was being sued for US$1.3 million for breach of contract regarding his conduct while filming a television series that would&#x27;ve been titled &quot;Dog Unleashed&quot;. While searching for Brian Laundrie, Chapman reportedly in illegal possession of a taser and made homophobic and racist comments, resulting in the show&#x27;s cancellation. While Chapman denied the claims against him, his daughter Bonnie said the allegations of homophobia and racism against him were true and his daughter Cecily called her father&#x27;s search for Laundrie a &quot;publicity stunt.&quot; Chapman then went onto say that Bonnie and Cecily were working for people who were seeking to get revenge by tarnishing his reputation.

In September 2022, at an Evangelical Christian conference in Council Bluffs, Iowa called &quot;Opening the Heavens,&quot; Chapman gave a speech on stage in which he referred to U.S President Joe Biden as &quot;little Hitler&quot; and alleged that voter fraud was responsible for Donald Trump failing to win his re-election campaign.

<text>The Unicode character (U+2019 ) is used for both a typographic apostrophe and a single right (closing) quotation mark. This is due to the many fonts and character sets (such as CP1252) that unified the characters into a single code point, and the difficulty of software distinguishing which character is intended by a user&#x27;s typing. There are arguments that the typographic apostrophe should be a different code point, U+02BC .

The straight apostrophe (the &quot;ASCII apostrophe&quot;, ) is even more ambiguous, as it could also be intended as a left or right quotation mark, or a prime symbol.

<doc id="248918" wikidata="Q4644270" url="?curid=248918" title="8-Bit Theater">
<text>8-Bit Theater is a sprite comic, meaning the art is mainly taken from pre-existing video game assets, created by Brian Clevinger. It was originally published from 2001 to 2010 and consists of 1,225 pages. The webcomic was, at times, one of the most popular webcomics, and the most popular sprite comic.

The comic initially follows and parodies the plot of the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game, following the &quot;Warriors of Light&quot; who are supposedly on a quest to find four elemental orbs to help them defeat Chaos. Instead, the characters mainly serve their own selfish interests, causing destruction in their wake.

The success of &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; contributed to the popularity in creating sprite comics, with one list recording over 1,200 sprite comics as of 2004. &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; allowed Clevinger to earn an income, and gain experience and exposure, which led to future works, such as &quot;Atomic Robo&quot;.

== Creation ==
&quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; began in March 2001. It was one of the first sprite comics, a comic made by using pre-existing video game graphics. In one interview, Brian Clevinger said that he had had the idea of doing a sprite comic but had not acted on it until someone sent him a link to the sprite comic &quot;Bob and George&quot; which inspired him to try it himself. Clevinger also said that he lacked drawing skills, which made a sprite comic attractive. Clevinger used the comics as part of a college assignment, saying that &quot;&quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; began as an excuse to essentially do nothing and get college credit for it&quot;. Clevinger originally intended to use &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; to adapt multiple NES games, such as &quot;Metroid&quot; &quot;and River City Ransom&quot;, but ultimately stuck with &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; because of the popularity of the manga based on the game.

&quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; uses sprites from the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game for the NES, as well as other games, though Clevinger often altered the sprites, added effects, and created original backgrounds, as well as using other pre-existing images from the internet. The comic sometimes used 16-bit or 32-bit sprites to depict more powerful creatures. While most speech bubbles are white with black text, colored bubbles or text are sometimes used to give an impression of the voice. The use of video game assets was unauthorized use of copyrighted material, but as of 2004 Clevinger had not heard directly from the copyright owners of the images. In 2004, Clevinger said that if he was to do it over again, he would not have done a sprite comic because of the limitations of pre-existing art and the copyright issues, but continued to produce &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; because &quot;it&#x27;s paying the bills... And also, as much as I complain about the limiting factors, it&#x27;s a lot of fun and I enjoy finding new ways to approach the material&quot;.

The comic also included original artwork created by Lydia Tyree and Kevin Sigmund, who contributed hand drawn art and custom sprites respectively. The final page of the comic, an epilogue, was drawn by Matt Speroni.

In a 2009 interview, Clevinger said that he typically spent Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings writing the comic, then spent the afternoons and evening putting the comic together. He used Adobe Photoshop to create the comic.

&quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; ended in 2010. Once completed, the comic had 1,225 pages.

== Premise ==
&quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; started out as a loose retelling and parody of the plot of the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game, and features exaggerated portrayals of characters from that game, including the main characters Fighter, Thief, Red Mage, and Black Mage. The group are ostensibly on a quest to find four elemental orbs to help them defeat Chaos, but the characters have no interest in the quest and mostly focus on furthering their own selfish goals. According to one reviewer: &quot;The first change it makes to the plot of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; is to turn the original protagonists into the three worst people in the world, plus Fighter. They lie, steal, and murder their way through the story, claiming to be heroes in the same way spam claims to be food. In their (very limited) defense, sometimes they just hurt people on accident... [the group goes] on a nine-year-tour of their world, marking their progress with new enemies, confused onlookers, and a whole lot of corpses&quot;. Clevinger described &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; in an interview as &quot;a comic about the four people most ill-equipped to save the world who, through chicanery and brute ignorance, are the very people tasked with doing so. It&#x27;s mostly a parody of fantasy and video game tropes, but a wide range of subjects are touched upon&quot;.

The comic points out and dissects many of the tropes used in role-playing video games, especially those from Japan. A significant portion of the humor results from creating reader anticipation for dramatic moments which fail to come; Clevinger said that &quot;[his] favorite comics are the ones where the joke is on the reader&quot;. According to a reviewer, &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; &quot;developed one of the most meta-textual, self-referential, self-deprecating encyclopedia of esoteric in-jokes&quot;.

== Characters ==
=== Light Warriors ===

The four main characters are collectively known as the &quot;Warriors of Light&quot; or the &quot;Light Warriors&quot;:

* Black Mage (full name Black Mage Evilwizardington): an ultra-violent, sadistic character who usually uses giant fireballs to respond to any situation. He attracts bad luck which causes innocent bystanders to be harmed. He often makes pathetic advances towards White Mage.
* Fighter (full name Fighter McWarrior): a constantly stupid character. He has a childlike innocence that &quot;somehow doesn&#x27;t keep him from being the group&#x27;s personal weapon of mass destruction&quot;.
* Thief (also known as the Prince of Elfland): the most competent of the group. He is driven by greed and self-interest. 
* Red Mage (full name Red Mage Statscowski): a min-maxer driven to gain the best stats possible. A reviewer described him as having &quot;a love-hate relationship with physics and logic, in that both hate him because he loves to snap natural laws like chicken bones in the grip of his truly impressive stupid ideas&quot;. He believes the world is a tabletop role-playing game.

=== Other notable characters ===
* White Mage — a priestess specializing in white (healing) magic. White Mage was assigned by her order to protect fate and to help the Light Warriors save the world. She discreetly follows the Light Warriors around the world for a lengthy portion of the comic to achieve this goal.
* Black Belt — a talented martial artist and travelling companion of White Mage. Black Belt had an extremely poor sense of direction, to the effect that the laws of physics and spacetime tended to rearrange themselves around him. He was killed by the Fiend Kary in the course of the series.
* Sarda the Sage — an omnipotent wizard who forces the Light Warriors to retrieve the four elemental orbs. He claims to be &quot;The Wizard Who Did It&quot; and uses his powers in an immensely irresponsible and careless manner.
* The Dark Warriors — the evil counterparts to the Light Warriors. A group of villains based on minor enemies from the game. They consist of Garland, Bikke the Pirate, Drizz&#x27;l the Dark Elf Prince, and Vilbert Von Vampire. They plot the downfall of the Light Warriors, but are depicted as even more inept than the Light Warriors themselves.
* The Four Fiends — powerful elemental beings that guard their respective elemental orbs. They are Lich, Kary, Ur, and Muffin. They were individually killed by the Light Warriors, and then, following their resurrection as a group, killed by Black Mage.

== Plot ==

&quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; opens with an introductory sequence that explains how the Light Warriors initially meet and decide to form an adventuring party in the kingdom of Corneria, where King Steve&#x27;s daughter, Princess Sara, is being held captive by the knight Garland in the nearby Temple of Fiends. After her rescue, during which both the Light Warriors and Garland himself are shown as so incompetent that Sara has to orchestrate her kidnapping and rescue herself, the king has a bridge built that connects Corneria to the main continent.

Here the Light Warriors meet the witch Matoya, who blackmails them into recovering her stolen crystal. In the port town of Pravoka the party defeats the pirate Bikke (accompanied by Garland) and uses his ship to travel on to Elfland. There, they discover the King has been poisoned, apparently by the same person who stole Matoya&#x27;s crystal, and Thief is the prince of Elfland. The Light Warriors retrieve the antidote and Matoya&#x27;s crystal from the dark elf Drizz&#x27;l, who is shortly thereafter recruited by Garland and Bikke. Upon his recovery, the Elf King sends the Light Warriors to save Elfland by retrieving the Earth Orb from two undead beings, Vilbert von Vampire and his father Lich, the Fiend of Earth. Vilbert survives the battle and is later recruited into Garland&#x27;s Dark Warriors, while Lich goes to hell. White Mage then sends the Light Warriors to meet Sarda the Sage, an omnipotent wizard who takes the Earth orb and proceeds to draft the group into quests for the other three elemental orbs.

The Fire Orb is held by Kary, the Fiend of Fire in Gurgu Volcano, who kills Black Belt before the group can defeat her and retrieve the orb. A subsequent side quest to the Ice Cave on Sarda&#x27;s behalf, during which the Light Warriors encounter squid-like Doom Cultists, is ultimately fruitless. A second side quest, however, involves the Light Warriors meeting the dragon god-king Bahamut, who sends them to the Castle of Ordeals to obtain a rat tail. There, the Light Warriors each face their own internal demons: Sloth (Fighter), Pride (Red Mage), Greed (Thief) and a doppelgänger of Black Mage, who is the only thing that can represent his evil. The Light Warriors present the rat tail to Bahamut, only to find that it is an ingredient in a virility soup his girlfriend Matoya makes for him. The party is rewarded with class upgrades: Red Mage becomes a Mime, Fighter becomes a Knight, Thief becomes a Ninja, and Black Mage becomes a Blue Mage with some help from a Dark God.

Returning to the task of retrieving the elemental orbs, the Light Warriors travel to the cities of Gaia and Onrac and use a submarine provided by Sarda to reach the Sea Shrine, where they meet the Doom Cultists a second time. After defeating them, they accidentally summon the third Fiend, Ur (known in the game as Kraken). The Light Warriors kill Ur, retrieve the Water Orb and travel on to Lefein in search of the Air Orb, where they meet Dragoon, the last Dragon Knight, and the evil dragon Muffin, the fourth Fiend, who guards the Orb of Air. During a battle in Muffin&#x27;s Sky Castle she is killed by Dragoon. The Sky Castle itself explodes after Fighter and Black Mage take the Air Orb.

Upon presenting the final orb to Sarda, he dismissively orders the Light Warriors to return to the Temple of Fiends, where they find that the Dark Warriors have made the temple their base of operations. During the night, Drizz&#x27;l summons the Four Fiends from Hell and has them confront the Light Warriors. Black Mage, using evil energy he absorbed from his doppelgänger, kills the fiends, absorbs their evil energies as well and turns on the other Light Warriors. Sarda interrupts the fight and reveals his intent to destroy the Light Warriors himself.

Sarda explains himself to be the grown-up version of a child that suffered great harm as a result of the Light Warrior&#x27;s actions around the world. Young Sarda became so focused on revenge that he studied to be a great wizard and travelled back in time to the beginning of the universe to remake it without the Light Warriors; after discovering that changing the past was impossible even for him, he decides to settle for making the Light Warriors into the warriors of legend, for no other reason than to further humiliate them in defeat. Sarda absorbs the orbs&#x27; magic energy as well as Black Mage&#x27;s evil energy and easily unmakes not only the Light Warriors&#x27; class changes, but also removes their original abilities. Sarda&#x27;s power quickly becomes erratic and unstable, and Chaos, the King of Demons, takes the opportunity to possess Sarda&#x27;s body and announce his plans to annihilate the universe.

However, before a final battle between the Light Warriors and Chaos can begin, he is destroyed off-panel by a group of four White Mages, a party combination that was dismissed in one of the earliest episodes as ineffectual for the game, and all credit for saving the world goes to a group of bystanders, the Dark Warriors. The Epilogue picks up three years later. White Mage visits Red Mage and Dragoon at a restaurant, where they have started up an extremely unsuccessful support group for sole survivors of ancient sects. Afterward, White Mage visits King Thief in Elfland, who has been trying to locate Black Mage and Fighter, in an effort to obtain more riches from their adventure. Black Mage and Fighter find themselves poor and out of work in a remote town, trying to make money by taking job postings in the town square. The epilogue ends with Fighter suggesting that they resume their search for the &quot;Armor of Invincibility&quot; that Fighter has been searching for since the beginning of the comic.

== Reception ==
=== Readership figures ===
Around 2003/04, &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; was the most popular sprite comic on the web and was one of the most popular and successful webcomics of all. In 2009, Multiverse Comics described it as &quot;massively successful&quot; and &quot;one of the bigger smash hits of the web-comic world&quot;.

Clevinger said in 2003 that standing out among webcomics was a big issue to success at that time, noting that he pulled in a lot of readers by being one of the first sprite comics, but said &quot;a gimmick like that can only take you so far. And usually it takes you to a lot of first time visitors with no repeat traffic&quot;.

=== Reviews during its run ===
Writing for 1Up.com in 2005, Nich Maragos said that &quot;it was unquestionably Brian Clevinger&#x27;s &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; that took [sprite comics] to its fullest expression and greatest popularity&quot;. Maragos said that &quot;unlike a lot of the lesser sprite comic creators, Clevinger spices up what could very quickly become a repetitive gimmick with lots of effects, original backgrounds, and uniquely altered sprites to make sure the series never gets visually stale. In addition to keeping the look of the strip fresh, the effort put into the layouts and effects also helps the artist fend off accusations that he&#x27;s merely ripping off existing work and passing it off as his own&quot;. Maragos did say that &quot;the humor is often far more repetitive than the art. To compensate for this, Clevinger begun focusing more on story than jokes some time ago, but as a rule the quality of the writing hasn&#x27;t become any sharper. A large component of the strip&#x27;s popularity is love for the characters Clevinger uses&quot;.

Reviewers writing for &quot;Sequential Tart&quot; recommended &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; on multiple occasions. Donielle Ficca wrote in 2007 that &quot;when I was introduced to &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot;, I was transported back to my mom&#x27;s basement playing role-play video games for hours at a time... Nearly every geek I know who loves older games absolutely loves &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot;. It has grown and welcomed into its fold newer people that simply have a particular sense of humor. If you are at all interested in parody or video games this is one comic you should definitely check out&quot;.

=== Reviews of the completed comic ===
Writing for Comic Book Resources, Larry Cruz said, &quot;[in sprite comics] every character is generally rendered in the same scale and the same sideways or three-quarters position from panel to panel, [so] sprite comics became the favorite style for the laziest webcomic creators. Clevinger could get away with it because he has a knack for writing dialogue that&#x27;s clever at times, silly at times, but always full of personality&quot;.

Mikkel Snyder, a staff writer for Black Nerd Problems, said that &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; was the first webcomic he read and was &quot;the comic that made me love comics&quot;. He described it as a &quot;sprawling saga&quot; which &quot;thrived on Clevinger&#x27;s love of video games and ability to use serialized webcomic formatting to tell this comedic tale&quot;.

Matthew Pardue reviewed &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; for the University of North Georgia&#x27;s University Press blog. Pardue strongly recommended the comic, though noted the humor was highly dark, that the comic featured &quot;() violence, adult concepts, and some adult language&quot;, and said, &quot;I personally think it takes some time for Clevinger to really hit his stride. His humor peeks through a little early on, but it only busts out in force after a few hundred strips&quot;.

Writing for Io9, Lauren Davis recommended &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; in a list of recommended completed webcomics for those that &quot;enjoy video game-inspired comics (and/or &quot;Atomic Robo&quot;)&quot;&quot;&quot;.

=== Awards ===
&quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; won the Web Cartoonists&#x27; Choice Award for Best Fantasy Comic in 2002, and was nominated for two other awards. It was also nominated for a WCCA award in 2003.

=== Financial success ===
In 2002, Clevinger was supporting himself financially from the comic through T-shirt sales, advertisements, and a &quot;donation&quot; service by which readers could voluntarily send him money. Clevinger offered rewards for donating such as wallpapers.

== Legacy ==
The success of &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; and another sprite comic &quot;Bob and George&quot;, along with their ease of creation, led to hundreds of other sprite comics. One list of sprite comics identified over 1,200 sprite comics as of 2004. Shaenon K. Garrity said in a history of webcomics: &quot;With the success of sprite comics like Brian Clevinger&#x27;s &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; (2001) and clipart comics like Ryan North&#x27;s &quot;Daily Dinosaur Comics&quot; (2003) and David Malki&#x27;s &quot;Wondermark&quot; (2003), people discovered that they didn&#x27;t need to be able to draw to be webcartoonists. The barn door flew open&quot;. However, no other sprite comic reached the popularity of &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot;.

&quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; was Brian Clevinger&#x27;s first experience writing a comic. His experience, as well as exposure through the comic, allowed him to write more comics, including &quot;Atomic Robo&quot; as well as writing for both Marvel Comics and DC Comics.

The comic was part of the Create a Comic Project, in which versions of the comic with dialog removed were provided to allow students to write their own, encouraging writing and creativity skills. An expansion pack for the board game Bargain Quest was released in 2019, based on characters and items from &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot;.

In 2021, Clevinger launched a Kickstarter for the &quot;8-Bit Theater 20th Anniversary Complete Script Book&quot; which collected every strip. The book was script-only due to copyright issues. It reached its initial goal on April 21.

<text>Craigellachie (pronounced ) is a locality in British Columbia, located several kilometres to the west of the Eagle Pass summit between Sicamous and Revelstoke. Craigellachie is the site of a tourist stop on the Trans-Canada Highway between Salmon Arm and Revelstoke.

It was named after the village of Craigellachie on the River Spey in Moray, Scotland, the ancestral home of Sir George Stephen, the first president of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). At a critical time in the railway&#x27;s development, Stephen travelled to Britain to raise desperately needed capital funding; when he succeeded, he telegraphed his associates in Canada quoting the familiar motto of Clan Grant: &quot;Stand fast, Craigellachie!&quot;

The Canadian Craigellachie is most famous for being the site of the &quot;Last Spike&quot; of the CPR, driven by Sir Donald Smith, a director of the CPR, on November 7, 1885.

<text>Software development is the process of designing and implementing a software solution to satisfy a user. The process is more encompassing than programming, writing code, in that it includes conceiving the goal, evaluating feasibility, analyzing requirements, design, testing and release. The process is part of software engineering which also includes organizational management, project management, configuration management and other aspects. 

Software development involves many skills and job specializations including programming, testing, documentation, graphic design, user support, marketing, and fundraising. 

Software development involves many tools including: compiler, integrated development environment (IDE), version control, computer-aided software engineering, and word processor.

The details of the process used for a development effort varies. The process may be confined to a formal, documented standard, or it can be customized and emergent for the development effort. The process may be sequential, in which each major phase (i.e. design, implement and test) is completed before the next begins, but an iterative approach where small aspects are separately designed, implemented and tested can reduce risk and cost and increase quality.

==Methodologies==
Each of the available methodologies are best suited to specific kinds of projects, based on various technical, organizational, project, and team considerations.
*The simplest methodology is the &quot;code and fix&quot;, typically used by a single programmer working on a small project. After briefly considering the purpose of the program, the programmer codes it and runs it to see if it works. When they are done, the product is released. This methodology is useful for prototypes but cannot be used for more elaborate programs.
*In the top-down waterfall model, feasibility, analysis, design, development, quality assurance, and implementation occur sequentially in that order. This model requires one step to be complete before the next begins, causing delays, and makes it impossible to revise previous steps if necessary.
*With iterative processes these steps are interleaved with each other for improved flexibility, efficiency, and more realistic scheduling. Instead of completing the project all at once, one might go through most of the steps with one component at a time. Iterative development also lets developers prioritize the most important features, enabling lower priority ones to be dropped later on if necessary. Agile is one popular method, originally intended for small or medium sized projects, that focuses on giving developers more control over the features that they work on to reduce the risk of time or cost overruns. Derivatives of agile include extreme programming and Scrum. Open-source software development typically uses agile methodology with concurrent design, coding, and testing, due to reliance on a distributed network of volunteer contributors.
*Beyond agile, some companies integrate information technology (IT) operations with software development, which is called DevOps or DevSecOps including computer security. DevOps includes continuous development, testing, integration of new code in the version control system, deployment of the new code, and sometimes delivery of the code to clients. The purpose of this integration is to deliver IT services more quickly and efficiently.
Another focus in many programming methodologies is the idea of trying to catch issues such as security vulnerabilities and bugs as early as possible (shift-left testing) to reduce the cost of tracking and fixing them.

In 2009, it was estimated that 32 percent of software projects were delivered on time and budget, and with the full functionality. An additional 44 percent were delivered, but missing at least one of these features. The remaining 24 percent were cancelled prior to release.

==Steps==
Software development life cycle refers to the systematic process of developing applications.
===Feasibility===
The sources of ideas for software products are plentiful. These ideas can come from market research including the demographics of potential new customers, existing customers, sales prospects who rejected the product, other internal software development staff, or a creative third party. Ideas for software products are usually first evaluated by marketing personnel for economic feasibility, fit with existing channels of distribution, possible effects on existing product lines, required features, and fit with the company&#x27;s marketing objectives. In the marketing evaluation phase, the cost and time assumptions become evaluated. The feasibility analysis estimates the project&#x27;s return on investment, its development cost and timeframe. Based on this analysis, the company can make a business decision to invest in further development. After deciding to develop the software, the company is focused on delivering the product at or below the estimated cost and time, and with a high standard of quality (i.e., lack of bugs) and the desired functionality. Nevertheless, most software projects run late and sometimes compromises are made in features or quality to meet a deadline.

===Analysis===
Software analysis begins with a requirements analysis to capture the business needs of the software. Challenges for the identification of needs are that current or potential users may have different and incompatible needs, may not understand their own needs, and change their needs during the process of software development. Ultimately, the result of analysis is a detailed specification for the product that developers can work from. Software analysts often decompose the project into smaller objects, components that can be reused for increased cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability. Decomposing the project may enable a multi-threaded implementation that runs significantly faster on multiprocessor computers.

During the analysis and design phases of software development, structured analysis is often used to break down the customer&#x27;s requirements into pieces that can be implemented by software programmers. The underlying logic of the program may be represented in data-flow diagrams, data dictionaries, pseudocode, state transition diagrams, and/or entity relationship diagrams. If the project incorporates a piece of legacy software that has not been modeled, this software may be modeled to help ensure it is correctly incorporated with the newer software.
===Design===

Design involves choices about the implementation of the software, such as which programming languages and database software to use, or how the hardware and network communications will be organized. Design may be iterative with users consulted about their needs in a process of trial and error. Design often involves people expert in aspect such as database design, screen architecture, and the performance of servers and other hardware. Designers often attempt to find patterns in the software&#x27;s functionality to spin off distinct modules that can be reused with object-oriented programming. An example of this is the model–view–controller, an interface between a graphical user interface and the backend.

===Programming===

The central feature of software development is creating and understanding the software that implements the desired functionality. There are various strategies for writing the code. Cohesive software has various components that are independent from each other. Coupling is the interrelation of different software components, which is viewed as undesirable because it increases the difficulty of maintenance. Often, software programmers do not follow industry best practices, resulting in code that is inefficient, difficult to understand, or lacking documentation on its functionality. These standards are especially likely to break down in the presence of deadlines. As a result, testing, debugging, and revising the code becomes much more difficult. Code refactoring, for example adding more comments to the code, is a solution to improve the understandability of code.

===Testing===

Testing is the process of ensuring that the code executes correctly and without errors. Debugging is performed by each software developer on their own code to confirm that the code does what it is intended to. In particular, it is crucial that the software executes on all inputs, even if the result is incorrect. Code reviews by other developers are often used to scrutinize new code added to the project, and according to some estimates dramatically reduce the number of bugs persisting after testing is complete. Once the code has been submitted, quality assurance—a separate department of non-programmers for most large companies—test the accuracy of the entire software product. Acceptance tests derived from the original software requirements are a popular tool for this. Quality testing also often includes stress and load checking (whether the software is robust to heavy levels of input or usage), integration testing (to ensure that the software is adequately integrated with other software), and compatibility testing (measuring the software&#x27;s performance across different operating systems or browsers). When tests are written before the code, this is called test-driven development.
===Production===

Production is the phase in which software is deployed to the end user. During production, the developer may create technical support resources for users or a process for fixing bugs and errors that were not caught earlier. There might also be a return to earlier development phases if user needs changed or were misunderstood.
==Workers==
Software development is performed by software developers, usually working on a team. Efficient communications between team members is essential to success. This is more easily achieved if the team is small, used to working together, and located near each other. Communications also help identify problems at an earlier state of development and avoid duplicated effort. Many development projects avoid the risk of losing essential knowledge held by only one employee by ensuring that multiple workers are familiar with each component. Software development involves professionals from various fields, not just software programmers but also individuals specialized in testing, documentation writing, graphic design, user support, marketing, and fundraising. Although workers for proprietary software are paid, most contributors to open-source software are volunteers. Alternately, they may be paid by companies whose business model does not involve selling the software, but something else—such as services and modifications to open source software.

==Models and tools==
===Computer-aided software engineering===
Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) is tools for the partial automation of software development. CASE enables designers to sketch out the logic of a program, whether one to be written, or an already existing one to help integrate it with new code or reverse engineer it (for example, to change the programming language).
===Documentation===

Documentation comes in two forms that are usually kept separate—that intended for software developers, and that made available to the end user to help them use the software. Most developer documentation is in the form of code comments for each file, class, and method that cover the application programming interface (API)—how the piece of software can be accessed by another—and often implementation details. This documentation is helpful for new developers to understand the project when they begin working on it. In agile development, the documentation is often written at the same time as the code. User documentation is more frequently written by technical writers.
===Effort estimation===

Accurate estimation is crucial at the feasibility stage and in delivering the product on time and within budget. The process of generating estimations is often delegated by the project manager. Because the effort estimation is directly related to the size of the complete application, it is strongly influenced by addition of features in the requirements—the more requirements, the higher the development cost. Aspects not related to functionality, such as the experience of the software developers and code reusability, are also essential to consider in estimation. , most of the tools for estimating the amount of time and resources for software development were designed for conventional applications and are not applicable to web applications or mobile applications.
===Integrated development environment===
An integrated development environment (IDE) supports software development with enhanced features compared to a simple text editor. IDEs often include automated compiling, syntax highlighting of errors, debugging assistance, integration with version control, and semi-automation of tests.

===Version control===

Version control is a popular way of managing changes made to the software. Whenever a new version is checked in, the software saves a backup of all modified files. If multiple programmers are working on the software simultaneously, it manages the merging of their code changes. The software highlights cases where there is a conflict between two sets of changes and allows programmers to fix the conflict.
===View model===

A view model is a framework that provides the viewpoints on the system and its environment, to be used in the software development process. It is a graphical representation of the underlying semantics of a view.

The purpose of viewpoints and views is to enable human engineers to comprehend very complex systems and to organize the elements of the problem around domains of expertise. In the engineering of physically intensive systems, viewpoints often correspond to capabilities and responsibilities within the engineering organization.

=== Fitness functions ===
Fitness functions are automated and objective tests to ensure that the new developments don&#x27;t deviate from the established constraints, checks and compliance controls.

==Intellectual property==
Intellectual property can be an issue when developers integrate open-source code or libraries into a proprietary product, because most open-source licenses used for software require that modifications be released under the same license. As an alternative, developers may choose a proprietary alternative or write their own software module.

<doc id="248942" wikidata="Q356195" url="?curid=248942" title="Andrew Luster">
<text>Andrew Stuart Luster (born December 15, 1963) is heir to the Max Factor cosmetics fortune and a convicted sex offender. He is the great-grandson of cosmetics giant Max Factor Sr. In 2003, he was convicted of multiple sexual assaults using the date-rape drug GHB.

==Early life==
Andrew Luster is the son of Henry Luster, a psychiatrist, and Elizabeth Luster (née Shore). His mother was the adopted daughter of Max Factor, Sr.&#x27;s daughter Freda. He grew up in Malibu, California, and attended Windward School in Los Angeles.

After graduating, Luster moved to Mussel Shoals, California, living on a $1 million trust fund and living in a $600,000 cottage on the beach. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, this move and Luster&#x27;s &quot;freewheeling lifestyle&quot; weakened his &quot;already tenuous&quot; ties to the Factor family, which was heavily involved in the arts and philanthropy.

==Sexual assault charges and conviction==
In 2000, Luster was arrested when a student at a local college told police that she had been raped at Luster&#x27;s home. Upon investigation, police charged Luster with drugging three women with the date-rape drug GHB, sexually assaulting them, and video-taping the assaults, having found videotapes of the assaults when they searched his home. After paying $1 million bail, Luster failed to appear in court to defend himself against the charges in January 2003. Luster was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; and sentenced to 124 years in prison. 

Luster&#x27;s legal case earned major attention due to his family&#x27;s wealth, and in January 2003, the FBI issued a warrant for Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution. In June 2003, he was captured by American bounty hunter Duane &quot;Dog&quot; Chapman in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Both Luster and Chapman were subsequently arrested by Mexican police. Luster was handed over to American authorities. Chapman&#x27;s felony kidnapping charge was reduced to a misdemeanor, and he fled Mexico when he was released on bail. Chapman later wrote that he believed his actions in Mexico were legal due to working closely with a Mexican police officer while in that nation, but the American judge in Luster&#x27;s case refused to grant Chapman any reward or bond. Chapman also explained that during his pursuit of Luster, he consulted with &quot;a forensic expert who specialized in sex crimes&quot; who believed Luster&#x27;s preference for raping unconscious, passive victims indicated a necrophile tendency that might lead to murder.

The California Court of Appeal refused Luster&#x27;s appeal, citing that Luster had been a fugitive. Longstanding precedent holds that fugitives flout the court&#x27;s authority, and thus forfeit their right to appeal. The California Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court later refused to overturn this ruling.

==Prison sentence and civil suits==
Luster is currently incarcerated at Valley State Prison in Chowchilla, California. Under California law, since his crimes harmed other persons, he is required to serve at least 85% of his sentence before becoming eligible for release with time off for good behavior. Had his original sentence stood, Luster would not have even been considered for release until he served 105 years—effectively a life sentence.

In late 2009, Luster filed a petition for &quot;habeas corpus&quot; as the final possibility of having his case reviewed by another court on appeal. Luster was represented in that suit by Jay Leiderman and J. David Nick. The &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition was granted in April 2012. On March 11, 2013, the Ventura County Superior Court vacated Luster&#x27;s 124-year sentence but not his conviction, based on the trial judge&#x27;s failure to state specific reasons for imposing consecutive sentences, and ordered a new sentencing hearing April 4, 2013.

On April 16, 2013, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kathryne Stoltz reduced Luster&#x27;s sentence to 50 years—48 years for the rapes and two years for the drug-related charges. Luster&#x27;s lawyers have indicated there will be an appeal.

In 2016, opponents of California Proposition 57 released a brochure that stated that Luster could be released early due to the lack of clarity for what defines &quot;violent crimes.&quot; In response to this brochure, California Governor Jerry Brown told Fresno County sheriff Margaret Mims that Luster was originally sentenced to 100 years in prison and was a registered sex offender, &quot;and on both accounts would not be getting out.&quot; Brown&#x27;s administration later clarified that since Luster would have to register as a sex offender, he would not be eligible for parole even if Proposition 57 passed.

Two of the victims won civil lawsuits against Luster, who was ordered to pay a total of $40 million. Luster subsequently sold most of his property and declared bankruptcy.

== Media portrayals ==
After Luster fled the United States, a movie based on his crimes, &quot;A Date with Darkness: The Trial and Capture of Andrew Luster&quot; was produced with the intention of aiding in his capture by ending with a photo of him, and a request for witnesses to his whereabouts to notify authorities. Because the film was in production when Luster was captured, the ending was re-written to incorporate his capture.

On August 28, 2009, the true crime TV Series &quot;Dominick Dunne&#x27;s Power, Privilege, and Justice&quot; aired an episode on the case in Season 3, Episode 4, &quot;Evil Deeds&quot;.

On August 31, 2017, Investigation Discovery aired the first episode of &quot;Guilty Rich&quot;, which recounted the story of Andrew Luster&#x27;s crimes, arrest, flight, and ultimate conviction and incarceration.

The case was also profiled in the sixth episode of the 15th season of &quot;Evil Lives Here&quot;.

<doc id="248943" wikidata="Q249321" url="?curid=248943" title="Yen and yuan sign">
<text>The yen and yuan sign (¥) is a currency sign used for the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan currencies when writing in Latin scripts. This character resembles a capital letter Y with a single or double horizontal stroke. The symbol is usually placed before the value it represents, for example: ¥50, or JP¥50 and CN¥50 when disambiguation is needed. When writing in Japanese and Chinese, the Japanese kanji and Chinese character is written following the amount, for example in Japan, and or in China.

== History ==
=== Japan ===
After the institution of Japan&#x27;s New Currency Act, from 1871 through the early 20th century, the yen was either referred to (in documents printed in Latin script) by its full name &quot;yen,&quot; or abbreviated with a capital &quot;Y&quot;. One of the earliest uses of can be found in J. Twizell Wawn&#x27;s &quot;Japanese Municipal Government With an Account of the Administration of the City of Kobe&quot;, published in 1899. Usage of the sign increased in the early 20th century, primarily in Western English-speaking countries, but has become commonly used in Japan as well.

== Code points ==
The Unicode code point is . Additionally, there is a full width character, , at code point for use with wide fonts, especially East Asian fonts.

There was no code-point for any ¥ symbol in the original (7-bit) US-ASCII and consequently many early systems reassigned (allocated to the backslash (\) in ASCII) to the yen sign. With the arrival of 8-bit encoding, the ISO/IEC 8859-1 (&quot;ISO Latin 1&quot;) character set assigned code point to the ¥ in 1985; Unicode continues this encoding.

In JIS X 0201, of which Shift JIS is an extension, assigns code point to the Latin-script yen sign: as noted above, this is the code used for the backslash in ASCII and also subsequently in Unicode. The JIS X 0201 standard was widely adopted in Japan.

===Microsoft Windows===
Microsoft adopted the ISO code in Windows-1252 for the Americas and Western Europe but Japanese-language locales of Microsoft operating systems use the code page 932 character encoding, which is a variant of Shift JIS. Hence, 0x5C is displayed as a yen sign in Japanese-locale fonts on Windows. It is thus displayed wherever a backslash is used, such as the directory separator character (for example, in rather than ) and as the general escape character (). It is mapped onto the Unicode (i.e. backslash), while Unicode is given a one-way &quot;best fit&quot; mapping to 0x5C in code page 932, and 0x5C is displayed as a backslash in Microsoft&#x27;s documentation for code page 932, essentially making it a backslash given the appearance of a yen sign by localized fonts. (Similarly in Korean versions of Windows, 0x5C was reassigned to hold the Won sign (₩) and has similar presentation issues.)

=== Mac OS ===
The symbol &quot;¥&quot; can be generated on most non-JP Mac OS keyboard layouts which do not have a dedicated key for it, typically through:

===IBM EBCDIC===
IBM&#x27;s Code page 437 used code point for the ¥ and this encoding was also used by several other computer systems. The ¥ is assigned code point B2 in EBCDIC 500 and many other EBCDIC code pages.

== Chinese input methods==
Under Chinese Pinyin input method editors (IMEs) such as those from Microsoft or Sogou.com, typing displays the full-width character , which is different from half-width used in Japanese IMEs.

==Native characters==

In East Asia, several CJK characters (Chinese characters, Japanese Kanji, and Korean Hanja) are used when writing own currencies in local languages. These characters include , , , , . In Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and Taiwan, these characters are also used as the local language counterpart in parallel with the dollar sign ($) (or HK$, MOP$, S$ or NT$ when necessary to indicate which currency is meant). The name of the North Korean and South Korean won (₩) comes from the equivalent hanja (, ) (, won).


== Other uses ==

===Turkmenistan===

In the 1993 Turkmen orthography, the yen sign was used as the capital form of ÿ and represented the sound . It was replaced with Ý in 1999.

===Germany===
The yen sign strongly resembles the unit insignia of the World War II German Army&#x27;s 17th Panzer Division.

<text>Rio Grande Games is a board game publisher based in Placitas, New Mexico. The company primarily imports and localizes foreign language German-style board games.

==History==

In 1995, Jay Tummelson began working for Mayfair Games. At that time, Mayfair had begun to import German-style board games for sale, without doing any localization. Tummelson first suggested that they incorporate an English translation, and then that they completely localize the game for American audiences. Tummelson acquired the rights for Detroit/Cleveland &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, &quot;Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Modern Art&quot;, &quot;Streetcar&quot;, and &quot;The Settlers of Catan&quot;, which were published together in 1996.

One part of the localization process was to create original art and components. Tummelson thought that a better solution would be to use the same artwork and components as the originals and to share the cost of printing with the European publishers, as well. In 1998, he founded Rio Grande Games to take that approach.

Since then, Rio Grande Games has published over 350 games and has had a significant effect on board gaming in the United States.

The most popular of the games published by Rio Grande Games are &quot;Carcassonne&quot;, &quot;Puerto Rico&quot;, &quot;Dominion&quot;, &quot;Power Grid&quot;, &quot;Race for the Galaxy&quot;, &quot;Bohnanza&quot;, and &quot;Lost Cities&quot;. More recently, Rio Grande Games has begun publishing its own games and has even begun licensing its games to partners in other countries wanting to localize the games in their local languages. Thus, &quot;Race for the Galaxy&quot; will soon be seen in Chinese, Korean, and others, as well as its original English, French, and German.

==Notable games==
Rio Grande has published a number of award-winning games.

<text>Port Colborne is a city in Ontario, Canada that is located on Lake Erie, at the southern end of the Welland Canal, in the Niagara Region of Southern Ontario. The original settlement, known as Gravelly Bay, dates from 1832 and was renamed after Sir John Colborne, a British war hero and the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada at the time of the opening of the (new) southern terminus of the First Welland Canal in 1833. The city&#x27;s population in 2021 was 20,033.

==History==
In pre-colonial times, Indigenous people of the Onguiaahra (Neutral Iroquois) lived in the area, due in part to the ready availability of flint and chert from outcroppings on the Onondaga Escarpment. This advantage was diminished by the introduction of firearms by European traders, and they were driven out by the Six Nations of the Iroquois around 1650 as part of the Beaver Wars.

Originally called Gravelly Bay, after the shallow, bedrock-floored bay upon which it sits, today&#x27;s City of Port Colborne traces its roots back to the United Empire Loyalist settlements that grew up in the area following the American Revolution. Growth became focused around the southern terminus of the Welland Canal after it reached Lake Erie in 1833. The town was the location of the Port Colborne explosion, a grain elevator explosion in 1919 that killed 10 and injured 16.

As the population rose, Welland County was formed in 1845 from Lincoln County and Port Colborne was incorporated as a village in 1870, became a town in 1918, merged with the neighbouring Village of Humberstone in 1952, and was re-incorporated as a city in 1966. In 1970, Niagara Region municipal restructuring added Humberstone Township, further expanding the city.

In the year 1888, American tourists from the Southern states began building vacation homes on the lakeshore of the Western edge of the town. By 1890, an entire gated community of vacationers from the US South called Port Colborne their home during the summer months, naming the community The Humberstone Club. Over 30 grand summer homes, along with a variety of clubhouses and service buildings, were built along the lake in the following years, many of which still stand today on historic Tennessee Avenue. The southern architecture and style of these buildings would influence the design and construction of other historic buildings in the area. During the American Civil War, Varina Davis, wife of Confederacy President Jefferson Davis, spent three years in the relative comfort and safety of the community. 

Port Colborne was one of the hardest hit communities during the Blizzard of 1977. Thousands of people were stranded when the city was paralyzed during the storm, and the incident remains one of significance to the local population.

===Environmental concerns===
Emissions from Inco&#x27;s base metal refinery, closed in 1984, resulted in soils contaminated with concentrations of nickel, copper and cobalt above the Ontario Ministry of the Environment&#x27;s &quot;soil remediation criteria.&quot; However, two studies, one in 1997 and another in 1999 found &quot;[no] adverse health effects which may have resulted from environmental exposures.&quot; After a series of public meetings between the City, the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) and Inco, it was decided to perform a Community-Based Risk Assessment, a process designed to determine whether the contamination poses a threat to the current, past, or future residents of Port Colborne, and what Inco must do to clean up the contaminated areas.

Some residents launched a Class-Action Lawsuit against Inco in 2001 seeking $750 million in damages to health, property value, and quality-of-life. Although this suit failed to be certified in 2002, it was subsequently modified to limit the class, and focus solely on devaluation of property and was certified on appeal on November 18, 2005. A timeline of the case has been written from the point of view of the plaintiffs.

On July 6, 2010, the Ontario Supreme Court sided with the residents and awarded more than 7,000 households in Port Colborne a total of $36 million. Households in the Rodney Street area, in the shadow of the nickel refinery, were each awarded $23,000 while those living on the east and west sides of Port Colborne were each awarded $9,000 and $2,500 respectively. Vale appealed the ruling to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which found in 2010 that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence of economic harm, raising the legal burden of proof but not invalidating Rylands v Fletcher as precedent law. In April 2012 the Supreme Court of Canada sided with Vale and denied the residents the awarded compensation. Court costs in the amount of CAD$1,766,000 were awarded the defendant by Henderson, J.

==Economy==
Maritime commerce, including supplying goods to the camps for the labourers who worked on the first canal, ship repair and the provisioning trade, was, and still is, an important part of Port Colborne&#x27;s economy. Like other cities in the region, Port Colborne was a heavily industrial city throughout most of the early 20th century because of its proximity to the hydroelectric power of Niagara Falls. A grain elevator, two modern flour mills, a nickel refinery, a cement plant operated by Port Colborne Canada Cement, and a blast furnace operated by Algoma Steel were all major employers.

As recently as 2017, Port Colborne has been successful attracting new industry, such as the agro-business operations of Casco Inc. and Jungbunzlauer, which process corn into products such as sweeteners and citric acid.

The International Nickel Company (now Vale) has long been one of the city&#x27;s main employers, since a World War I scandal prompted the opening of a refinery in 1918. Taking advantage of inexpensive hydroelectricity from generating stations at nearby Niagara Falls, from 1922 the refinery produced electrolytic nickel and Platinum group metals. It grew to employ over 2,000 workers by the 1950s. Cutbacks in operations and increasing factory automation have reduced the workforce to its present-day (2018) total of 170.

Marine Recycling Corporation is a ship recycling firm, boasting of Green (environmentally friendly) services, located next to the Welland Canal at Gravelly Bay and operating since the 1970s.
A 2012 report indicates the following as the largest private sector employers, with a staff of over 50, in Port Colborne at that time:

* Port Colborne Poultry (Pinty&#x27;s Delicious Foods, now owned by Olymel), 229 employees 
* Vale Canada Limited, 200 
* J. Oskam Steel Fabricators Ltd., 150
* IMT Partnership, 108 
* ADM Milling, 95 
* Thurston Machine Co. Ltd., 85 
* JTL Machine Ltd., 78 
* Jungbunzlauer Canada Inc., 74 
* Brennan Paving Ltd., 70
* Ingredion Canada Inc., 70

==Arts and culture==

Port Colborne hosts the annual Canal Days festival in recognition of the important role played by the Welland Canal in the history of the city. Originating as a small fair held at the Port Colborne Historical and Marine Museum, it has grown to feature live music, an antique car show, fireworks, tall ships, a kite festival, and international foods. The festival also highlights Lock 8, which at , is one of the world&#x27;s longest canal locks. Lock 8 keeps the water level on the Welland Canal constant independent of weather on Lake Erie. Hence the ships are only raised or lowered one to four feet depending on the current water level in Lake Erie. Much of the festival centres around West St., which runs parallel to the canal, and offers a view of the Clarence St. Bridge, built in 1929, it is one of only three remaining lift bridges on the canal today.

The Port Colborne Historical and Marine Museum, located near the centre of town, is a resource for local history and archival research. In addition to a collection of historic buildings and artifacts, it opened the &quot;Marie Semley Research Wing&quot; to foster research into local history, named to commemorate the long-standing efforts of a local resident who devoted hours to the museum.

The community features theatre venues with the professional Lighthouse Festival Theatre (formerly Showboat) and the amateur Port Colborne Operatic Society. The company has been presenting annual productions since its inception in 1945.

The Port Colborne Lions Club, chartered in 1922, is one of the world&#x27;s oldest Lions Clubs, and one of Canada&#x27;s oldest service clubs in continuous operation. The club is still active within the community, hosting many yearly events including an annual Lions Club Carnival in the summer.

Kinnear House is a local heritage property associated with the jurist Helen Kinnear, the first woman in Canada to be appointed judge by the federal government, or to appear as counsel before the Supreme Court.

The &quot;incredible shrinking mill&quot; is an optical illusion produced when viewing the federal grain elevator in Port Colborne. When travelling east on Lakeshore Road, the mill appears to move farther away as one drives closer.

==Attractions==

Tourism is important to the Port Colborne&#x27;s economy, aided by the city&#x27;s proximity to Lake Erie beaches and marinas, and to Niagara Falls. In 2015, Port Colborne formed The Tourism and Marketing Advisory Committee to provide advice and recommendations for increasing this aspect of the economy. Described by the city as &quot;Niagara&#x27;s South Coast&quot;, Port Colborne features live theatre, golfing, multi-use trails, fishing, beaches, restaurants, recreation, a marina, and shopping districts along the Welland Canal.

<text>The section sign (§) is a typographical character for referencing individually numbered sections of a document; it is frequently used when citing sections of a legal code. It is also known as the section symbol, section mark, double-s, or silcrow. In other languages it may be called the &quot;paragraph symbol&quot; (for example, ).

== Use ==
The section sign is often used when referring to a specific section of a legal code. For example, in Bluebook style, &quot;Title 16 of the United States Code Section 580p&quot; becomes &quot;16 U.S.C. §580p&quot;. The section sign is frequently used along with the &quot;pilcrow&quot; (or &quot;paragraph sign&quot;), , to reference a specific paragraph within a section of a document. 

While is usually read in spoken English as the word &quot;section&quot;, many other languages use the word &quot;paragraph&quot; exclusively to refer to a section of a document (especially of legal text), and use other words to describe a paragraph in the English sense. Consequently, in those cases &quot;§&quot; may be read as &quot;paragraph&quot;, and may occasionally also be described as a &quot;paragraph sign&quot;, but this is a description of its usage, not a formal name. 

When duplicated, as , it is read as the plural &quot;sections&quot;. For example, &quot;§§13–21&quot; would be read as &quot;sections 13 through 21&quot;, much as (pages) is the plural of , meaning page.
It may also be used with footnotes when asterisk , dagger , and double dagger have already been used on a given page.

It is common practice to follow the section sign with a non-breaking space so that the symbol is kept with the section number being cited.

The section sign is itself sometimes a symbol of the justice system, in much the same way as the Rod of Asclepius is used to represent medicine. For example, Austrian courts use the symbol in their logo.

== Unicode ==
The section sign appeared in several early computer text encodings. It was placed at (167) in ISO-8859-1, a position that was inherited by United as code point .

== Origin ==
Two possible origins are often posited for the section sign: most probably, that it is a ligature formed by the combination of two S glyphs (from the Latin &quot; &quot;). Some scholars, however, are skeptical of this explanation.

Others have theorized that it is an adaptation of the Ancient Greek (&quot;paragraphos&quot;), a catch-all term for a class of punctuation marks used by scribes with diverse shapes and intended uses.

The modern form of the sign, with its modern meaning, has been in use since the 15th century.

== In literature ==
In Jaroslav Hašek&#x27;s &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot;, the symbol is used repeatedly to mean &quot;bureaucracy&quot;. In his English translation of 1930, Paul Selver translated it as &quot;red tape&quot;.

<text>Presolar grains are interstellar solid matter in the form of tiny solid grains that originated at a time before the Sun was formed. Presolar grains formed within outflowing and cooling gases from earlier presolar stars. The study of presolar grains is typically considered part of the field of cosmochemistry and meteoritics.

The stellar nucleosynthesis that took place within each presolar star gives to each granule an isotopic composition unique to that parent star, which differs from the isotopic composition of the Solar System&#x27;s matter as well as from the galactic average. These isotopic signatures often fingerprint very specific astrophysical nuclear processes that took place within the parent star or formation event and prove their presolar origin.

==Terminology==
Presolar grains are individual solid grains which condensed around distant stars or as part of novae, and potentially supernovae outflows, which were accreted in the early solar nebula and remain in relatively unaltered chondritic meteorites. As they were accreted before the formation of the Solar System, they must be presolar. Presolar grains also exist in the interstellar medium. Researchers occasionally use the term &quot;stardust&quot; to refer to presolar grains, particularly in science communication, though the term is sometimes used interchangeably in the scientific literature.

==History==

In the 1960s, the noble gases neon and xenon were discovered to have unusual isotopic ratios in primitive meteorites; their origin and the type of matter that contained them was a mystery. These discoveries were made by vaporizing a bulk sample of a meteorite within a mass spectrometer, in order to count the relative abundance of the isotopes of the very small amount of noble gases trapped as inclusions. During the 1970s similar experiments discovered more components of trapped xenon isotopes. Competing speculations about the origins of the xenon isotopic components were advanced, all within the existing paradigm that the variations were created by processes within an initially homogeneous solar gas cloud.

A new theoretical framework for interpretation was advanced during the 1970s when Donald D. Clayton rejected the popular belief among meteoriticists that the Solar System began as a uniform hot gas. Instead he predicted that unusual but predictable isotopic compositions would be found within thermally condensed interstellar grains that had condensed during mass loss from stars of differing types. He argued that such grains exist throughout the interstellar medium. Clayton&#x27;s first papers using that idea in 1975 pictured an interstellar medium populated with supernova grains that are rich in the radiogenic isotopes of Ne and Xe that had defined the extinct radioactivities. Clayton defined several types of presolar grains likely to be discovered: &quot;stardust&quot; from red giant stars, &quot;sunocons&quot; (acronym from &quot;SU&quot;per&quot;NO&quot;va &quot;CON&quot;densates) from supernovae, &quot;nebcons&quot; from nebular condensation by accretion of cold cloud gaseous atoms and molecules, and &quot;novacons&quot; from nova condensation. Despite vigorous and continuous active development of this picture, Clayton&#x27;s suggestions lay unsupported by others for a decade until such grains were discovered within meteorites.

The first unambiguous consequence of the existence of presolar grains within meteorites came from the laboratory of Edward Anders in Chicago, who found using traditional mass spectrometry that the xenon isotopic abundances contained within an acid-insoluble carbonaceous residue that remained after the meteorite bulk had been dissolved in acids matched almost exactly the predictions for isotopic xenon in red giant dust condensate. It then seemed certain that presolar grains were contained within Anders&#x27; acid-insoluble residue. Finding the actual presolar grains and documenting them was a much harder challenge that required locating the grains and showing that their isotopes matched those within the red-giant star. There followed a decade of intense experimental searching in the attempt to isolate individual grains of those xenon carriers. But what was really needed to discover presolar grains was a new type of mass spectrometer that could measure the smaller number of atoms in a single grain. Sputtering ion probes were pursued by several laboratories in the attempt to demonstrate such an instrument. But the contemporary ion probes needed to be technologically much better.

In 1987 diamond grains and silicon carbide grains were found to exist abundantly in those same acid-insoluble residues and also to contain large concentrations of noble gases. Significant isotopic anomalies were in turn measured by improvements in secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) within the structural chemical elements of these grains. Improved SIMS experiments showed that the silicon isotopes within each SiC grain did not have solar isotopic ratios but rather those expected in certain red-giant stars. The finding of presolar is therefore dated 1987. To measure the isotopic abundance ratios of the structural elements (e.g. silicon in an SiC grain) in microscopic presolar grains had required two difficult technological and scientific steps: 1) locating micron-sized presolar grains within the meteorite&#x27;s overwhelming mass; 2) development of SIMS technology to a sufficiently high level to measure isotopic abundance ratios within micron-sized grains. Ernst Zinner became an important leader in SIMS applications to microscopic grains.

In January 2020, analysis of the Murchison meteorite concluded that out of 40 presolar silicon carbide grains examined, one had formed 3 ± 2 billion years before Earth&#x27;s 4.6 billion year-old sun. This would make some of the grains the oldest solid material ever discovered on Earth.

==In meteorites==
Presolar grains are the solid matter that was contained in the interstellar gas before the Sun formed. The presolar component can be identified in the laboratory by their abnormal isotopic abundances and consists of refractory minerals which survived the collapse of the solar nebula and the subsequent formation of planetesimals.

To meteorite researchers, the term presolar grains has come to mean presolar grains found in meteorites, of which 99% are stardust. Many other types of cosmic dust have not been detected in meteorites. Presolar grains comprise only about 0.1 percent of the total mass of particulate matter found in meteorites. Such grains are isotopically-distinct material found in the fine-grained matrix of meteorites, such as primitive chondrites. Their isotopic differences from the encasing meteorite require that they predate the Solar System. The crystallinity of those clusters ranges from micrometer-sized silicon carbide crystals (up to 1013 atoms), down to that of nanometer-sized diamond (about 1000 atoms), and unlayered graphene crystals of fewer than 100 atoms. The refractory grains achieved their mineral structures by condensing thermally within the slowly cooling expanding gases of supernovae and of red giant stars. 

== Characterization ==
Presolar grains are investigated using scanning or transmission electron microscopes (SEM/TEM), and mass spectrometric methods (noble gas mass spectrometry, resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS, NanoSIMS)). Presolar grains that consist of diamonds are only a few nanometers in size and are, therefore, called nanodiamonds. Because of their small size, nanodiamonds are hard to investigate and, although they are among the first presolar grains discovered, relatively little is known about them. The typical sizes of other presolar grains are in the range of micrometers.

Presolar grains consisting of the following minerals have so far been identified:

*diamond (C) nanometer-sized grains (~ diameter) possibly formed by vapor deposition
*graphite (C) particles and anions, some with unlayered graphene cores
*silicon carbide (SiC) submicrometer to micrometer sized grains. Presolar SiC occurs as single-polytype grains or polytype intergrowths. The atomic structures observed contain the two lowest order polytypes: hexagonal 2H and cubic 3C (with varying degrees of stacking fault disorder) as well as 1-dimensionally disordered SiC grains. In comparison, SiC synthesized in terrestrial laboratories is known to form over a hundred polytypes.
*titanium carbide (TiC) and other carbides within C and SiC grains
*silicon nitride ()
*corundum ()
*spinel ()
*hibonite ()
*titanium oxide ()
*silicate minerals (olivine and pyroxene)

== Information on stellar evolution ==
The study of presolar grains provides information about nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution. Grains bearing the isotopic signature of &quot;r-process&quot; (rapid neutron capture) and alpha process (alpha capture) types of nucleosynthesis are useful in testing models of supernova explosions.

1% of presolar grains (supernova grains) have very large excesses of calcium-44, a stable isotope of calcium which normally composes only 2% of the calcium abundance. The calcium in some presolar grains is composed primarily of 44Ca, which is presumably the remains of the extinct radionuclide titanium-44, a titanium isotope which is formed in abundance in Type II supernovae such as SN 1987A after rapid capture of four alpha particles by 28Si, after the process of silicon burning normally begins, and prior to the supernova explosion. However, 44Ti has a half-life of only 59 years, and thus it is soon converted entirely to 44Ca. Excesses of the decay products of the longer-lived, but extinct, nuclides calcium-41 (half-life 99,400 years) and aluminium-26 (730,000 years) have also been detected in such grains. The rapid-process isotopic anomalies of these grains include relative excesses of nitrogen-15 and oxygen-18 relative to Solar System abundances, as well as excesses of the neutron-rich stable nuclides 42Ca and 49Ti.

Other presolar grains provide isotopic and physical information on asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB stars), which have manufactured the largest portion of the refractory elements lighter than iron in the galaxy. Because the elements in these particles were made at different times (and places) in the early Milky Way, the set of collected particles further provides insight into galactic evolution prior to the formation of the Solar System.

In addition to providing information on nucleosynthesis of the grain&#x27;s elements, solid grains provide information on the physico-chemical conditions under which they condensed, and on events subsequent to their formation. For example, consider red giants — which produce much of the carbon in our galaxy. Their atmospheres are cool enough for condensation processes to take place, resulting in the precipitation of solid particles (i.e., multiple atom agglomerations of elements such as carbon) in their atmosphere. This is unlike the atmosphere of the Sun, which is too hot to allow atoms to build up into more complex molecules. These solid fragments of matter are then injected into the interstellar medium by radiation pressure. Hence, particles bearing the signature of stellar nucleosynthesis provide information on (i) condensation processes in red giant atmospheres, (ii) radiation and heating processes in the interstellar medium, and (iii) the types of particles that carried the elements of which we are made, across the galaxy to the Solar System.

<text>Dunadd (Scottish Gaelic &quot;Dún Ad&quot;, &quot;fort on the [River] Add&quot;, Old Irish &quot;Dún Att&quot;) is a hillfort in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, dating from the Iron Age and early medieval period and is believed to be the capital of the ancient kingdom of Dál Riata. Dal Riata was a Gaelic kingdom spanning the northern Irish coast to Argyll and the Scottish islands in the early centuries AD, possibly after the Romans had abandoned Southern Britain and at the time when the Anglo-Saxons were crossing the North Sea to counter incursions over Hadrian&#x27;s Wall by the Picts and Dalriadan Scots.

==Description==

Dunadd is a rocky crag that may have been one time an island and now lies inland near the River Add, from which it takes its name, a little north of Lochgilphead (NR 836 936). The surrounding land, now largely reclaimed, was formerly boggy and known as the &quot;Mòine Mhòr&quot; (&quot;Great Moor&quot;) in Gaelic. This no doubt increased the defensive potential of the site. Detailed analysis of sea-level changes in the region argue that the Dun was an island or promontory into historic times, and that receding sea levels left the fortification open to siege and seizure in the 6th to 7th centuries.

==History==

Originally occupied in the Iron Age, the site later became a seat of the kings of Dál Riata. It is known for its unique stone carvings below the upper enclosure, including a footprint and basin thought to have formed part of Dál Riata&#x27;s coronation ritual. On the same flat outcrop of rock is an incised boar in Pictish style, and an inscription in the ogham script. The inscription is read as referring to a &quot;Finn Manach&quot; and is dated to the late 8th century or after.

Dunadd is mentioned twice in early sources. In 683 the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; record: &quot;The siege of Dún At and the siege of Dún Duirn&quot; without further comment on the outcome or participants. In the same chronicle the entry for 736 states: &quot;Aengus son of Fergus, king of the Picts, laid waste the territory of Dál Riata and seized Dún At and burned Creic and bound in chains two sons of Selbach, i.e. Donngal and Feradach.&quot;

The site was occupied after 736, at least into the 9th century. It is mentioned twice in later sources, suggesting that it retained some importance. In 1436, it is recorded that &quot;Alan son of John Riabhach MacLachlan of Dunadd&quot; was made seneschal of the lands of Glassary; the chief place of residence of the MacLachlans of Dunadd lay below the fort. In June 1506, commissioners appointed by James IV, including the earl and bishop of Argyll, met at Dunadd to collect rents and resolve feuds.

The site is an Ancient Monument, under the care of Historic Scotland, and is open to the public (open all year; no entrance charge).

==Excavations==

Because Dunadd is mentioned in early sources, and is readily identifiable, it has been excavated on several occasions (1904–1905, 1929, and 1980) and has one of the most important ensembles of finds from any early medieval site in Scotland. Finds range from the 6th to the 8th centuries AD. These include tools, weapons, quernstones, imported pottery and motif-pieces and moulds for the manufacture of fine metalwork (especially jewellery).

== Bruach An Druimein connection ==
Seven kilometres to the north of Dunadd is the site of Bruach An Druimein. Excavated in the 1960s in advance of gravel quarrying, archaeologists discovered the remains of a Bronze Age cists cemetery, two round houses from the Iron Age, and a number of artefacts from the early medieval period that were contemporary with Dunadd. Two medieval glass beads were found that have similar chemical compositions to those found at Dunadd, leading the archaeologists to believe that the beads came from Dunadd and that the site was associated with, or controlled by Dunadd.

== In fiction ==

In Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;The Mark of the Horse Lord&quot; the Dal Riada undergo an internal struggle for control of royal succession, with Dun Monaidh central to the conflict, including a depiction of royal coronation and use of carved footprint. Dunadd is the location for Claire R. McDougall&#x27;s novel &quot;Veil of Time,&quot; in which a modern-day woman is transported back to Dunadd&#x27;s heyday in the 8th century. All the features of Dunadd, including the footprint, the boar, the well and the tumble down ruins are features of the story, as are the modern farm and cottages . Other ancient sites in the Kilmartin Valley also play a part in the narrative.

<text>The Duchy of Brunswick and Lüneburg (), commonly known as the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg or Brunswick-Lüneburg, was an imperial principality of the Holy Roman Empire in the territory of present day Lower Saxony.

In 1235, Otto I was enfeoffed with the newly founded Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg at the Court of Mainz. It was based on the two castles in Brunswick and Lüneburg and the associated estate of the House of Welf. In 1269 there was a first division between the brothers Albrecht and Johann. The resulting principalities of Brunswick and Lüneburg together continued to form the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg.

The history of the duchy and the constituent principalities was marked by further divisions and mergers of the principalities. The constituent principalities existed until the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. At the Congress of Vienna, the Kingdom of Hanover and the Duchy of Brunswick were created as successor states. To this day, members of the House of Hanover call themselves Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg.

== History ==

When the Imperial ban was placed on Henry the Lion in 1180, he lost his titles as Duke of Saxony and Duke of Bavaria. He went into exile for several years, but was then allowed to stay on the (allodial) estates inherited from his mother&#x27;s side until the end of his life.

At the Imperial Diet of 1235 in Mainz, as part of the reconciliation between the Hohenstaufen and Welf families, Henry&#x27;s grandson, Otto the Child, transferred his estates to Emperor Frederick II and was enfeoffed in return with the newly created Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, which was formed from the estates transferred to the Emperor as well as other large areas of the imperial fisc. After his death in 1252, he was succeeded by his sons, Albert the Tall and John, who ruled the dukedom jointly.

In 1269, the duchy was divided, Albert receiving the southern part of the state around Brunswick and John the northern territories in the area of Lüneburg. The towns of Lüneburg and Brunswick remained in the overall possession of the House of Welf until 1512 and 1671 respectively. In 1571 the Amt of Calvörde became an exclave of the Duchy. The various parts of the duchy were further divided and re-united over the centuries, all of them being ruled by the Welf or Guelph dynasty, who maintained close relations with one another—not infrequently by marrying cousins—a practice far more common than is the case today, even among the peasantry of the Holy Roman Empire, for the contemporary salic inheritance laws encouraged the practice of retaining control of lands and benefits. The seats of power moved in the meantime from Brunswick and Lüneburg to Celle and Wolfenbüttel as the towns asserted their independence.

In the 18th century, a number of soldiers and officers from the duchy fought for the British in the American Revolutionary War, such as at the Battle of Bennington and Battles of Saratoga.

== History of the subordinate principalities ==

The subsequent history of the dukedom and its subordinate principalities was characterised by numerous divisions and reunifications. The subordinate states that were repeatedly created, and which had the legal status of principalities, were generally named after the residence of their rulers.

The estates of the different dynastic lines could be inherited by a side line when a particular family died out. For example, over the course of the centuries there were the Old, Middle and New Houses (or Lines) of Brunswick, and the Old, Middle and New Houses of Lüneburg. The number of simultaneously reigning dynastic lines varied from two to five.

=== Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel ===

In 1269, the Principality of Brunswick was formed following the first division of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In 1432, as a result of increasing tensions with the townsfolk of Brunswick, the Brunswick Line moved their &quot;Residence&quot; to Wolfenbüttel, into the water castle, which was expanded into a &quot;Schloss&quot;, whilst the town was developed into a royal seat. The name Wolfenbüttel was given to this principality. From 1546, Wolfenbüttel became the residence of the senior prince of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Henry, Duke of Brunswick-Dannenberg.

With sole rights to the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, he provided a conditional sub-lease of the Principality of Lüneburg to the princes of Calenberg with the conditions of payment to the Wolfenbüttel heirs (Chief of the House), together with the guarantee that only his descendants would inherit this senior principality of Wolfenbüttel. Not until 1753/1754 was the &quot;Residence&quot; moved back to Brunswick, into the newly built Brunswick Palace.

Following the Congress of Vienna and territorial adjustments the principality formed the basis of the new Duchy of Brunswick.

=== Principality of Calenberg (later Electorate of Hanover) ===

In 1432, the estates gained by the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel between the Deister and Leine split away as the Principality of Calenberg.
To the north, this new state bordered on the County of Hoya near Nienburg and extended from there in a narrow, winding strip southwards up the River Leine through Wunstorf and Hanover where it reached the Principality of Wolfenbüttel. In 1495, it was expanded around Göttingen. In 1584, it returned to the Wolfenbüttel Line.

In 1634, as a result of inheritance distributions, it went to the House of Lüneburg, before becoming an independent principality again in 1635, when it was given to George, younger brother of Prince Ernest II of Lüneburg, who chose Hanover as his &quot;Residenz&quot;. New territory was added in 1665 in the vicinity of Grubenhagen and in 1705 around the Principality of Lüneburg. In 1692, Duke Ernest Augustus from the Calenberg Line, acquired the right to be a prince-elector as the Prince-Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Colloquially, the Electorate was also known as the Electorate of Hanover or as &quot;Kurhannover&quot;. In 1814, it was succeeded by the Kingdom of Hanover.

=== Principality of Lüneburg ===

The Principality of Lüneburg emerged alongside the Principality of Brunswick in 1269 when the inheritance of the Duchy was divided. After the death of Duke George William of Brunswick-Lüneburg in 1705, King George I inherited the state of Lüneburg, being both the benefactor of Georges William&#x27;s 1658 renunciation in favour of his younger brother Ernest Augustus and the husband of the Duke&#x27;s morganatic daughter, Sophie Dorothea, later known as the &quot;Princess of Ahlden&quot;. It was united with the Principality of Calenberg, which had been elevated in 1692 into the Electorate.

=== Principality of Göttingen ===

The southernmost principality in the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg stretched from Münden in the south down the River Weser to Holzminden. In the east it ran through Göttingen along the River Leine via Northeim to Einbeck. It emerged in 1345 as the result of a division of the Principality of Brunswick and was united in 1495 with Calenberg.

=== Principality of Grubenhagen ===

From 1291 to 1596, Grubenhagen was an independent principality, its first ruler being Henry the Admirable, son of Albert of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. The state lay along the northern part of the Solling hills and the River Leine near Einbeck and north of the Eichsfeld on and in the southwestern Harz. After being split in the course of the years into smaller and smaller principalities, Grubenhagen returned in 1596 to Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and was ceded to the Calenberg line in 1665.

=== Other branches ===
Other branches that did not have full sovereignty included the states of Dannenberg, Harburg, Gifhorn, Bevern, Osterode, Herzberg, Salzderhelden, and Einbeck.

While a total of about a dozen subdivisions that existed, some were only dynastic and not recognised as states of the Empire, which at one time had over 1500 such legally recognized entities. In the List of Reichstag participants (1792), the following four subdivisions of Brunswick-Lüneburg had recognized representation:
* The Principality of Lüneburg.
* The Principality of Calenberg-Göttingen, merged under Eric I of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in 1495.
* The Principality of Grubenhagen.
* The Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.

By 1705 only two Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg survived, one ruling Calenberg, Lüneburg and other possessions, and the other ruling Wolfenbüttel.

===From Lüneburg to Hanover===

One of the dynastic lines was that of the princes of Lüneburg, which, in 1635, acquired Calenberg for George, a junior member of the family who set up residence in the city of Hanover. His son Christian Louis, and his brothers inherited Celle in 1648 and thereafter shared it and Calenberg between themselves; a closely related branch of the family ruled separately in Wolfenbüttel.

The territories of Calenberg and Lüneburg-Celle were made an Electorate by the Emperor Leopold I in 1692 in expectation of the imminent inheritance of Celle by the Duke of Calenberg, though the actual dynastic union of the territories did not occur until 1705 under his son George I Louis, and the Electorate was not officially approved by the Imperial Diet until 1708.

The resulting state was known under many different names: Brunswick-Lüneburg, Calenberg, Calenberg-Celle; its ruler was often known as the &quot;Elector of Hanover&quot;. Coincidentally, in 1701, the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg found himself in the line of succession for the British crown, later confirmed in 1707 by the Act of Union, which he subsequently inherited, thereby creating a personal union of the two crowns on 20 October 1714.

After a little over a decade, the matter of the disputed electorate was settled upon the heir, and the new Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (acceded as duke on 23 January 1698), George I Louis, was able to style himself the Elector of Brunswick and Lüneburg from 1708. It was not just happenstance but also religion-driven politics that brought about the circumstance that he was also put into the line of succession for the British crown by the Act of Settlement— which was written to ensure a Protestant succession to the thrones of Scotland and England at a time when anti-Catholic sentiment ran high in much of Northern Europe and much of Great Britain.

In this event, George I succeeded his second cousin Anne, Queen of Great Britain—the last reigning member of the House of Stuart—and subsequently formed a personal union on August 1st, 1714 between the British crown and the duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg (electorate of Hanover), which would last until well after the end of the Napoleonic wars more than a century later—including even through the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire and the rise of a new successor kingdom. In that manner, the &quot;Electorate of Hanover&quot; (the core duchy) was enlarged with the addition of other lands and became the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 at the peace conferences (Congress of Vienna) settling the future shape of Europe in the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars.

===History of the relationship to the British Crown===
The first Hanoverian King of Great Britain, George I of Great Britain, was the reigning Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and was finally made an official and recognized prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire in 1708. His possessions were enlarged in 1706 when the hereditary lands of the Calenberg branch of the Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg merged with the lands of the Lüneburg-Celle branch to form the Electorate of Hanover. Subsequently, George I was referred to as Elector of Hanover.

In 1700 and 1701, when the English Parliament had addressed the question of an orderly succession, with a particular religious bias toward a Protestant ruler, from the childless ruling Queen Anne (House of Stuart), it passed the provisions of the Act of Settlement 1701 to Sophia of Hanover, granddaughter of James I. Sophia predeceased Queen Anne by a few weeks, but her son and heir, George I, succeeded as King of Great Britain when Anne, his second cousin, died in August 1714. Great Britain and Hanover remained united in personal union until the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837.

George I was followed by his son George II and then his great-grandson George III, the latter retaining the position of elector even after the Holy Roman Empire was abolished by its last emperor in 1806. George III contested the validity of the dissolution of the Empire and maintained separate consular offices and staff for the Electorate of Hanover until the Congress of Vienna at the war&#x27;s end. After the fall of Napoleon, George III regained his lands plus lands from Prussia as King of Hanover, whilst giving up some other smaller scattered territories.

== Duchy of Brunswick ==

The Wolfenbüttel Line retained its independence, except from 1807 to 1813, when it and Hanover were merged into the Napoleonic Kingdom of Westphalia. The Congress of Vienna of 1815 turned it into an independent state under the name &quot;Duchy of Brunswick&quot;. The Duchy remained independent and joined first the North German Confederation and then the German Empire in 1871.

When the Wolfenbüttel Line became extinct in 1884, the German government withheld the rightful heir, the Crown Prince of Hanover, from taking control, instead installing a regency. Decades later, the families were reconciled by the marriage of the Crown Prince&#x27;s son to the Emperor&#x27;s only daughter, and Wilhelm II, German Emperor, allowed his son-in-law to assume rule in 1913 (his father having renounced his own right).

<text>Bristol is a town in Bristol County, Rhode Island, United States, as well as the county seat. The population of Bristol was 22,493 at the 2020 census. It is a deep water seaport named after Bristol, England. Major industries include boat building and related marine industries, manufacturing, and tourism. The Bristol Warren Regional School District manages the unified school system for Bristol and the neighboring town of Warren. Prominent communities include Portuguese-Americans, mostly Azoreans, and Italian-Americans.

== History ==

=== Early colonization ===

Before the Pilgrims arrived in 1620, the Pokanokets occupied much of Southern New England, including Plymouth. They had previously suffered from a series of plagues which killed off large segments of their population, and their leader, the Massasoit Osamequin, befriended the early settlers. King Philip&#x27;s War was a conflict between the Plymouth settlers and the Pokanokets and allied tribes, and it began in the neighboring area of Swansea, Massachusetts. Metacomet made nearby Mount Hope (a corruption of the Pokanoket word &quot;Montaup&quot;) his base of operations; he died following an ambush by Captain Benjamin Church on August 12, 1676. &quot;Massasoit&#x27;s Seat&quot; is a rocky ledge on the mountain which was a lookout site for enemy ships on Mount Hope Bay.

After the war concluded, four Boston merchantsStephen Burton, Nathaniel Byfield, Nathaniel Oliver, and John Walleypurchased a tract of land known as &quot;Mount Hope Neck and Poppasquash Neck&quot; as part of the Plymouth Colony. Other settlers included John Gorham and Richard Smith. A variant of the Indian name Metacomet is now the name of a main road in Bristol: Metacom Avenue (RI Route 136). Bristol was a town of Massachusetts until the Crown transferred it to the Rhode Island Colony in 1747.

=== Slave trade and the DeWolf family ===
The DeWolf family was among the earliest settlers of Bristol. Bristol and Rhode Island became a center of slave trading, from which it derived much of its wealth. James DeWolf, a leading slave trader, later became a United States Senator from Rhode Island. Beginning in 1769 and continuing until 1820 (over a decade after the slave trade was outlawed in the Atlantic), the DeWolf family trafficked people out of West Africa, enslaving them and bringing them to work on DeWolf-owned plantations, or selling them to be auctioned at ports in places such as Havana, Cuba and Charleston, South Carolina. Sugar and molasses from slave plantations in Cuba would be brought to Rhode Island to DeWolf-owned distilleries. By the end of 1820, the DeWolf family had trafficked and enslaved over 10,000 Africans. James DeWolf died as the second wealthiest person in the United States.

Quakers from Rhode Island were involved early in the abolition movement, although abolition was a divisive issue among Quakers, resulting in the creation of new Quaker groups. The DeWolf family, as well as Bristol&#x27;s and the northern United States&#x27; participation in slavery, are featured in the 2008 documentary &quot;Traces of the Trade: A Story from the Deep North&quot;, in the 2008 companion memoir &quot;Inheriting the Trade: A Northern Family Confronts Its Legacy as the Largest Slave-Trading Dynasty in U.S. History&quot; by Thomas Norman DeWolf, and the 2014 historical study &quot;James DeWolf and the Rhode Island Slave Trade&quot; by Cynthia Mestad Johnson.

=== American Revolution ===

During the American Revolutionary War, the British Royal Navy bombarded Bristol twice. On October 7, 1775, a group of ships led by Captain Wallace and sailed into town and demanded provisions. When refused, Wallace shelled the town, causing much damage. The attack was stopped when Lieutenant Governor William Bradford rowed out to &quot;Rose&quot; to negotiate a cease-fire, but then a second attack took place on May 25, 1778. This time, 500 British and Hessian troops marched through the main street (now called Hope Street (RI Route 114)) and burnt 30 barracks and houses, taking some prisoners to Newport.
=== New Goree ===
Starting in at least in 1805, a community of free Blacks known as &quot;New Goree&quot; existed along the northern portion of Wood Street in the 19th century from Bayview Avenue to Union Street. This community disappeared by 1900. An African Methodist Episcopal church stood at 417 Wood Street, but was razed by 1898; the Bristol Sports Club currently stands on that lot. Two modest homes on Wood Street were identified in 2023 as being New Goree homes. Researchers speculate that the construction of a United States Rubber Company plant on Wood Street in 1864 may have played a role in the neighborhood&#x27;s demise.

=== Other history and current day ===

Until 1854, Bristol was one of the five state capitals of Rhode Island.

Bristol is home to Roger Williams University, named for Rhode Island founder Roger Williams.

The southerly terminus of the East Bay Bike Path is located at Independence Park on Bristol Harbor. The bike path continues north to India Point Park in Providence, R.I., mostly constructed following an abandoned railroad right of way. Some of the best views of Narragansett Bay can be seen along this corridor. The construction of the East Bay Bike Path was highly contested by Bristol residents before construction because of the potential of crime, but it has become a welcome asset to the community and the anticipated crime was non-existent.

The Bristol-based Herreshoff boat company built five consecutive America&#x27;s Cup Defenders between 1893 and 1920. The Colt Estate, now known as Colt State Park, was home to Samuel P. Colt, nephew of the man famous for the arms company, and founder of the United States Rubber Company, later called Uniroyal and the largest rubber company in the nation. Colt State Park lies on manicured gardens abutting the West Passage of Narragansett Bay, and is popular for its views of the waterfront and sunsets.

Bristol is the site of the National Historic Landmark Joseph Reynolds House built in 1700. The Marquis de Lafayette and his staff used the building as headquarters in 1778 during the Battle of Rhode Island.

====Fourth of July parade====

Bristol has the oldest continuously celebrated Independence Day festivities in the United States. The first mention of a celebration comes from July 1777, when a British officer noted sounds coming from across Narragansett Bay:

The annual official and historic celebrations (Patriotic Exercises) were established in 1785 by Rev. Henry Wight of the First Congregational Church and veteran of the Revolutionary War, and later by Rev. Wight as the Parade, and continue today, organized by the Bristol Fourth of July Committee. The festivities officially start on June 14, Flag Day, beginning a period of outdoor concerts, soapbox car races and a firefighters&#x27; muster at Independence Park. The celebration climaxes on July 4 with the oldest annual parade in the United States, &quot;The Military, Civic and Firemen&#x27;s Parade&quot;, an event that draws over 200,000 people from Rhode Island and around the world. These elaborate celebrations give Bristol its nickname, &quot;America&#x27;s most patriotic town&quot;.

Bristol is represented in the parade with hometown groups like the Bristol Train of Artillery and the Bristol County Fifes and Drums.

<text>The Principality of Calenberg was a dynastic division of the Welf Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg established in 1432. Calenberg was ruled by the House of Hanover (from the Principality of Lüneburg) from 1635 onwards; the princes received the ninth electoral dignity of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692. Their territory became the nucleus of the Electorate of Hanover, ruled in personal union with the Kingdom of Great Britain from 1714 onwards. The principality received its name from Calenberg Castle, a residence of the Brunswick dukes.

== Territory ==

When Eric I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg chose the Principality of Calenberg as his part of the inheritance in 1495, he described it as &quot;the land between the River Leine and the Deister&quot;. This geographical description, however, was never totally correct. In fact, the principality extended west of the Leine from Schulenburg as far as Neustadt am Rübenberge in the north and thus much further north than the foothills of the Deister. To the south-west the territory stretched as far as Hamelin on the Weser, well beyond the Deister.

The city of Hanover was largely independent of Welf territorial lordship, even though it was not formally a free imperial city. Not until George of Calenberg, who had been a successful general in the Thirty Years War, chose the city as his &quot;Residenz&quot; in 1636 could Hanover also be viewed as part of the Principality of Calenberg. Calenberg Castle was demolished and slighted between 1692 and 1694.

Because of the link that had existed since 1463 between the principalities of Calenberg and Göttingen, the latter was also sometimes referred to as Calenberg. Today the term Calenberg Land is usually only used for the region between Hanover and the Deister.

==History==

=== Origins and foundation of Calenberg Castle ===

Originally the territory belonged to the Duchy of Saxony but in 1180, after the imperial ban had been imposed on the Welf prince, Henry the Lion, he lost his ducal lands in Saxony and Bavaria. However, in 1235, Henry&#x27;s grandson, Otto the Child, was promoted to the rank of prince as a result of the reconciliation between the Houses of Hohenstaufen and Welf and was given the allodial estates of the family claimed by them in the area between Lüneburg and Brunswick as the new and independent Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In the region west of Hanover, the Welfs had but few allodial possessions and so that area was disputed between the House of Welf and the bishops of Hildesheim and Minden. It was largely ruled by comital dynasties, such as the counts of Wölpe in the northwest, the counts of Hallermund in the southwest and the counts of Rhoden in the west and in Hanover.

In 1292 Duke Otto the Strict from the Lüneburg line of the Welfs subjugated the region. Earlier, he had yielded to the Bishop of Hildesheim and accepted the city of Hanover as his fief. However, he shook off his allegiance and founded Calenberg Castle, just 13 km west of Hildesheim, in a countermove in order to further reduce the power of the Bishop of Hildesheim in the Hanover area.

Administratively, this area was initially still called the &quot;Vogtei&quot; of Lauenrode, after Lauenrode Castle on the outskirts of Hanover, from where, the Welfs ruled the territory. With the extinction of the Lüneburg line of the Welfs, the Lüneburg War of Succession, broke out (1371–88) during which Lauenrode Castle was stormed by the citizens of Hanover and destroyed. The &quot;Vogtei&quot; was then moved to Calenberg Castle.

=== Welf inheritance divisions ===
The Welf dukes did not inherit their land by primogeniture and this resulted in the late Middle Ages in numerous Welf estates and a great fragmentation of Welf territory. In 1400 the &quot;Vogtei&quot; of Calenberg went to the Wolfenbüttel line of the Welfs. In 1408 and 1409 they were able to purchase the county of Everstein and the lordship of Homburg after the extinction of their reigning families. These were added to the &quot;Vogtei&quot; of Calenberg. In a further Welf inheritance in 1432 - the ninth according to Gudrun Pischke - the area was divided again by the Welf dukes William the Victorious and Henry the Peaceful who had hitherto ruled jointly in the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. While Henry retained the Wolfenbüttel lands, William was compensated with the newly created Principality of Calenberg. At that time, the lordship given to William had no name. It consisted of the rights formerly owned by the Principality of Lüneburg between the Deister range and the Leine river, as well as the former County of Wölpe, the lordship of Hallermund near Springe and the Homburg and Everstein dominions.

As the Welf princes all carried the ducal title and the territories they ruled were principalities within the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, their dominions were named after the main castle or town. William spent most of his time at Calenberg Castle from where he administered the territory. As a result, it is probable that the name of the Principality of Calenberg emerged during this time.

=== Unification with Göttingen ===
Between 1442 and 1463 William succeeded in taking over the rule over the Brunswick Principality of Göttingen. Although unification with Calenberg initially came about purely by chance, it lasted nonetheless. In order to distinguish the two areas which were physically separated by the foothills of the uplands in the Leine valley, Calenberg in the north was usually referred to as &quot;Unterwald&quot; (&quot;Lower Forest&quot;), whilst the Göttingen region was called the &quot;Oberwald&quot; (&quot;Upper Forest&quot;). When in 1473 William also inherited the Principality of Wolfenbüttel from his brother Henry who had left no heirs, he ceded sovereignty over Calenberg to his sons William the Younger and Frederick III, known as &quot;the Restless&quot; or &quot;Turbulentus&quot;.

After the death of William the Victorious in 1482 both sons shared the regency. In an agreement dated 1 August 1483, however, they split the rights of use (&quot;Mutschierung&quot;). The younger son, Frederick the Restless, was awarded the rights of use over Calenberg and Göttingen, and his brother William the Younger was awarded the rule over Wolfenbüttel. Nevertheless, in 1484/85 William deposed his brother Frederick and declared him insane. The reasons for his removal are debated; perhaps by his participation in many armed conflicts, Frederick was seen to pose a threat to Welf rule in Calenberg and Göttingen. So William succeeded - albeit only briefly - in re-uniting the entire territory of the principalities of Calenberg, Brunswick-Göttingen and Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. After Frederick&#x27;s death in 1495, however, William again divided his territories and left the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel to his elder son Henry V.

=== Under Eric I, Elisabeth and Eric II ===

The younger son, Eric I received Calenberg and Göttingen and thus founded the Calenberg line of the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In the new territory so formed, the name Calenberg was increasingly used for both parts of the state. For the period under Eric I and his son, Eric II, however, the name &quot;Principality of Calenberg-Göttingen&quot; was also used a lot. The principality had separate parliamentary Estates and separate councils for each part. The chancellery for &quot;Unterwald&quot; was established in Neustadt on Rübenberge and that for &quot;Oberwald&quot; in Münden. There were also separate residences, lordly castles or manor houses and palaces in each town as well as separate repositories for their records.

Under Eric I, Calenberg Castle was expanded into a strong fortress. Another heavily fortified castle, which he had built, was the Erichsburg near Dassel on which construction began in 1527. In the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud in 1519 he was initially defeated militarily in the Battle of Soltau. Diplomatically, however, he was able to win a ruling from the Emperor Charles V that saw a large part of the Prince-Bishopric of Hildesheim added to his domain.

Eric I was hostile to the emerging Protestant Reformation. His second wife, Elisabeth of Brandenburg, however, whom he married in 1525, switched over to the new doctrine in 1535 and promoted it at the court, which then resided at Münden. After Eric&#x27;s death in 1540 she took over the government for their underage son, Eric II, and implemented the Reformation in the principality with the state superintendent Antonius Corvinus she had appointed. Eric II, however, converted to Roman Catholicism in 1547 even though he was raised as an Evangelical by his mother. He was not able to reverse the Reformation in the principality however. His power in the principality was already very weak. He spent most of his time as a mercenary leader abroad, and was financially dependent on the towns. In 1553 he had to secure the financial aid of his towns by approving evangelical preaching. From 1574 he had Neustadt am Rübenberge developed as a fortified town and built Landestrost Castle within its walls as a Renaissance chateau, integrated into a bastion fortress based on the Italian model.

In 1582 when the counts of Hoya died out, the larger part of the county went to Calenberg. In 1584 Calenberg also acquired the Diepholz.

=== Thirty Years&#x27; War ===
After Eric&#x27;s death in 1584 Calenberg-Göttingen was again ruled by the Wolfenbüttel line of the Welfs. In the Thirty Years&#x27; War the brother of Duke Frederick Ulrich, &quot;mad&quot; Christian, brought the war to the state. After Danish troops under King Christian IV, who was then commander of the Lower Saxon Circle, was defeated by the general of the Catholic League, Tilly in the Battle of Lutter, Tilly occupied the whole principality in 1626. Only the cities of Brunswick and Hanover could not be captured.
When Duke Frederick Ulrich died childless in 1634 the Wolfenbüttel line of the Middle House of Brunswick ended with him. In 1635 Duke Augustus the Elder from the Middle House of Lüneburg received the Principality of Calenberg-Göttingen. After his death in 1636 his younger brother George became its ruler. He was successful as a general on the Swedish side and he also succeeded in 1637 in recovering the country and especially the towns for the Welfs. He initially ruled out of occupied Hildesheim, but then moved his residence to Hanover, which he also had built as a fortress. He had the former Franciscan friary, built around 1300, converted into the Leineschloss, which from then on served as a residence for the sovereigns of the principality. After his death in 1641 a separate peace was hastily concluded with the emperor, which had to be paid for by the return of the land acquired during the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud. George&#x27;s sons, Christian Louis, George William, John Frederick and Ernest Augustus then ruled the Principality of Calenberg-Göttingen in succession.

=== Elevation to an electorate ===

In 1665 the Principality of Grubenhagen, whose line had died out in 1596 and over which the lines of Lüneburg and Wolfenbüttel had long fought in the Imperial Chamber Court, was also finally added to the Calenberg dynasty. George&#x27;s youngest son, Ernest Augustus, who ruled from 1679, carried on the successful policies of his father and his brothers. In 1689 the Calenbergs also inherited Saxe-Lauenburg. Ernest Augustus switched to the side of the emperor and introduced primogeniture, contrary to the direction of his father. In 1692 for his services to the emperor, Ernest Augustus was rewarded after a long struggle with the title of the ninth electorate. Officially he was now the Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg and his government was called the &quot;Electoral Brunswick-Lüneburg Government&quot;. In 1705 it was enhanced further by the inheritance of the Principality of Lüneburg, whereby all the estates of the Welfs, apart from the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, became united under the line also known as the House of Hanover from which the British royal throne are descended.

== Economic and social history ==
The Principality of Calenberg was initially a rather insignificant territory and Welf lordship developed here quite late. By the reign of George of Calenberg in 1636, the principality had experienced 140 years of almost continuously poor government that cared little about the state. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance the cultural centres lay outside Calenberg in the towns of Brunswick, Hildesheim and Lüneburg. New centres were created at the residences of Wolfenbüttel and Celle. Even the city of Hanover was not governed by the Calenberg princes until 1636. The other towns remained unimportant.

Only after the reign of George of Calenberg and its subsequent elevation to the electorate did the former Principality of Calenberg become the nucleus of what later became the German state of Lower Saxony.

<text>Thorold is a city in Ontario, Canada, located on the Niagara Escarpment. It is also the seat of the Regional Municipality of Niagara. The Welland Canal passes through the city, featuring lock 7 and the Twin Flight Locks. 

==History==
The first survey of Thorold, or Township 9 as it was known then, occurred in 1788. The earliest communities in what is now Thorold emerged at Beaverdams, DeCew Falls and St. Johns. In 1846, the community had a population of about 1,000 and there were three churches or chapels and a post office. Various types of tradesmen worked here. Industry included two grist mills, a cement mill, a brewery and three wagon makers. There were seven taverns. Thorold, located on the brow of the Niagara Escarpment, soon became dominant and was incorporated as a village in 1850. Its formation was linked to the creation of the First Welland Canal. The village experienced population growth as the canal became more developed. In 1875, Thorold became a town. 

When the Regional Municipality of Niagara was formed in 1970, the Town of Thorold expanded to include the former Thorold Township. In 1975, the town became incorporated as the City of Thorold.

Thorold is also the location of the War of 1812 battle site, Beaverdams, where, on June 25, 1813, Colonel Charles Boerstler and his American troops were defeated by the British regulars and Caughnawaga Mohawks.

The 2021 Canadian census identified Thorold as the eighth-fastest growing municipality in Canada.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Thorold had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Economy ==

Thorold&#x27;s economy, like other municipalities in the Niagara Region, has benefitted from the Welland Canal. An estimated 37 million tonnes of freight is handled and shipped there annually.

Thorold South has several industrial and manufacturing businesses.

==Arts and culture==
The Thorold Reed Band has been in operation since its formation in 1851. The band has performed every year, with the exception of 2020 and 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario. The Canal Bank Shuffle is an annual musical festival that takes place in Thorold. The event features blues music.

In July 2024, downtown Thorold was used as a filming location for the eighteenth season of Murdoch Mysteries. 11 scenes were filmed in the city. Thorold was chosen due to its proximity to other filming locations and the lack of &quot;contamination&quot; in historical buildings. The setting being filmed for the series was Grimsby.

==Attractions==
=== Parks and trails ===
Officially opened in 2002, the Mel Swart Lake Gibson Conservation Park is a 29-acre waterfront park located on Lake Gibson. The park is part of the Niagara Greenbelt. The Short Hills Provincial Park is also partially located in the City of Thorold.

The Welland Canal Parkway Trail is a paved 42 km recreational path along the Welland Canal, from Lake Ontario to Lake Erie.

===Historic sites===
There are multiple historic sites in Thorold. These include: 
==Sports==

The Thorold Blackhawks are a Junior &#x27;B&#x27; hockey team in the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League. In 2023, the team permanently moved to Port Colborne from Thorold.

Thorold, along with other municipalities in the Niagara Region, hosted events for the 2022 Canada Summer Games. The Canada Games Park was built in Thorold for the event. The facility cost 102.7 million dollars. In 2023, it was determined by a municipal lawyer that the city of Thorold did not own the arena and was instead one of three co-tenants leasing it from Brock University.

== Infrastructure ==
In 2015, the Ontario government provided money to Thorold under the Small Communities Fund. The city used the 4.6 million dollars in funding to start building an affordable housing complex for seniors. 14.8 million dollars through the National Housing Co-Investment Fund was also used for the project.

=== Transportation ===

The Thorold Tunnel is an underwater vehicular tunnel, built between 1965 and 1967, which allows Highway 58 to cross the Welland Canal without interrupting shipping. Approximately 24,300 vehicles pass through the tunnel daily.

=== Niagara Detention Centre ===
Thorold is home to the Niagara Detention Centre, a 260-person capacity maximum-security prison. It generally serves people on remand, offenders sentenced to short terms (60 days or less), and offenders awaiting transfer to larger federal or provincial facilities.

== Education ==
Thorold Secondary School is the only high school in the city. In 2012, District School Board of Niagara trustees voted on whether to close the school and decided to keep it open. Thorold is close in proximity to Brock University and therefore has a large student population. In 2021, four students were arrested after a large street party took place in the city.

<text>Sharman Douglas (October 5, 1928 – February 3, 1996) was an American socialite known for her friendship with the British royal family, in particular Princess Margaret.

She was the only daughter of chemicals heiress and philanthropist Peggy Zinsser (d. 1992) and politician Lewis W. Douglas (d. 1974), the latter of whom served as an Arizonan congressman, director of the Bureau of the Budget from 1933 until 1934, and U.S. ambassador to the Court of St. James&#x27;s from 1947 until 1950. It was during these three years in England that she developed her friendship with Princess Margaret and the royal family.

At various times in her life, &quot;Charmin&#x27; Sharman&quot;, as she was known during her father&#x27;s tenure as ambassador, worked as a talent agent, a movie publicist, and a public-relations agent. In 1966, New York City mayor John Lindsay named her New York&#x27;s Commissioner of Public Events.

Linked romantically to the Marquess of Blandford and the Marquess of Milford Haven in the 1950s, she also reportedly had a two-year relationship with the United Kingdom&#x27;s Princess Margaret, according to &quot;Margaret: The Secret Princess&quot;, an ITV program broadcast in Britain in February 2003.

Sharman Douglas married Andrew MacKenzie Hay, a food importer, in 1968. They divorced in 1977.

Her first cousin Josalee Douglas was the first wife of Count Jean-François de Chambrun, who later married Raine, Countess Spencer, the stepmother of Diana, Princess of Wales.

Sharman Douglas died of bone cancer at New York Hospital in 1996. Sharman is buried in Locust Valley Cemetery, Locust Valley, New York.

<doc id="248973" wikidata="Q826021" url="?curid=248973" title="Kenmu Restoration">
<text>The was a three-year period of Imperial rule in Japanese history between the Kamakura period and the Muromachi period from 1333 to 1336. The Kenmu Restoration was an effort made by Emperor Go-Daigo to overthrow the ruling Kamakura Shogunate (&quot;de facto&quot; ruled by Hōjō clan) and restore the Imperial House to power in Japan, returning to civilian government after 148 years of &quot;de facto&quot; military government from Kamakura. Go-Daigo launched the Genkō War in 1331 against the Kamakura Shogunate but was defeated and forced to exile to the Oki Islands. Go-Daigo launched a second uprising, and with the assistance of the defected Kamakura general Ashikaga Takauji and rebel leader Nitta Yoshisada, defeated the Kamakura Shogunate at the siege of Kamakura in 1333. The Imperial House was restored to power but Go-Daigo&#x27;s policies failed to satisfy his major &quot;samurai&quot; supporters and most Japanese people. The Kenmu Restoration was ultimately overthrown when Takauji became &quot;Shōgun&quot; and founded the Ashikaga Shogunate in 1336, beginning the &quot;Northern and Southern Courts&quot; period and the Muromachi period.

The Kenmu Restoration was the last time the Emperor of Japan held significant power until the Meiji Restoration in 1868.

== Background ==
The Emperor&#x27;s role had been usurped by the Minamoto and Hōjō families ever since Minamoto no Yoritomo had obtained from the Emperor the title of &quot;shōgun&quot; in 1192, ruling thereafter from Kamakura.
For various reasons, the Kamakura shogunate decided to allow two contending imperial lines—known as the Southern Court or junior line, and the Northern Court or senior line—to alternate on the throne. The method worked for several successions until a member of the Southern Court ascended to the throne as Emperor Go-Daigo. Go-Daigo wanted to overthrow the shogunate and openly defied Kamakura by naming his own son his heir. In 1331 the shogunate exiled Go-Daigo but loyalist forces, including Kusunoki Masashige, rebelled and came to his support. They were aided by, among others, future &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Takauji, a samurai who had turned against Kamakura when dispatched to put down Go-Daigo&#x27;s rebellion. At roughly the same time, Nitta Yoshisada, another eastern chieftain, attacked the shogunate&#x27;s capital. The shogunate tried to resist his advance: Yoshisada and shogunate forces fought several times along the Kamakura Kaidō, for example at , (both near today&#x27;s Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture), and Bubaigawara, in today&#x27;s Fuchū, ever closer to Kamakura. The city was finally reached, besieged, and taken. Kamakura would remain for one century the political capital of the Kantō region, but its supremacy as political centre was over.

== Objectives of the restoration ==
When Emperor Go-Daigo ascended the throne in 1318, he immediately manifested his intention to rule without interference from the military in Kamakura. Historical documents show that, disregarding evidence to the contrary, he and his advisers believed that a revival of the Imperial House was possible, and that the Kamakura&#x27;s shogunate was the greatest and most obvious of the obstacles.

Another situation that begged for a solution was the land-ownership problem posed by the manors and their lands (see the article shōen). The great landowners shugo (governors) and jitō (manor&#x27;s lord), with their political independence and their tax exemptions were impoverishing the government and undermining its authority, and Kitabatake Chikafusa, Go-Daigo&#x27;s future chief adviser, discussed the situation in his works on succession. Chikafusa admitted that nobody had any intention of abolishing those privileges, so the hope of success on this front was from the beginning clearly very dim. What he planned to replace &quot;shugo&quot; and &quot;jitō&quot; with is unclear, but he surely had no intention of sharing power with the samurai class. However serious the land ownership problem, Go-Daigo and his advisers made no serious effort to solve it, partly because it was samurai from the manors in the western provinces that had defeated the shogunate for him. In such a situation, any effort to regulate the manors was bound to cause resentment among key allies.

== Failure of Go-Daigo&#x27;s policies ==
The Emperor reclaimed the property of some manors his family had previously lost control of, rewarding them with, among others, Buddhist temples like Tō-ji and Daitoku-ji in the hope to obtain their support. He however failed to protect the rights of tenants and workers, whose complaints poured into the monasteries.

He did not understand the importance to him of the warrior class either, because he never properly rewarded his minor samurai supporters, as he could have done using lands from the confiscated Hōjō lands, indulging instead in favoritism. These errors are the key to understanding the events of the next few decades. After rewarding religious institutions, he prepared to redistribute Hōjō lands, and samurai came to him in great numbers to lay their claims. The biggest rewards were given to samurai, among them Nitta Yoshisada, the man who had destroyed the Kamakura shogunate, and Ashikaga Takauji. In so doing, however, he failed to return control of the provinces to civilians. But he made his greatest error when he failed to properly reward minor warriors who had supported him. The tribunals set up to the purpose were inefficient and too inexperienced for the task, and corruption was rife. Samurai anger was made worse by the fact that Go-Daigo, wanting to build a palace for himself but having no funds, levied extra taxes from the samurai class. A wave of enmity towards the nobility started to run through the country, growing stronger with time. The Taiheiki also records that, although Takauji and Yoshisada were richly rewarded, the offices of &quot;shugo&quot; and &quot;jito&quot; in more than fifty provinces went to nobles and court bureaucrats, leaving no spoils for the warriors. By the end of 1335 the Emperor and the nobility had lost all support of the warrior class.

== Rise of the Ashikaga brothers ==
Go-Daigo wanted to re-establish his rule in Kamakura and the east of the country without sending a &quot;shōgun&quot; there, as this was seen as still too dangerous. As a compromise, he sent his six-year-old son Prince Norinaga to Mutsu Province (the eastern part of today&#x27;s Tōhoku region, stretching from Fukushima Prefecture in the south to Aomori Prefecture in the north) and nominated him Governor-General of the Mutsu and Dewa Provinces. In an obvious reply to this move, Ashikaga Takauji&#x27;s younger brother Tadayoshi without an order from the Emperor escorted another of his sons, eleven-year-old Nariyoshi (a.k.a. Narinaga) to Kamakura, where he installed him as Governor of the Kōzuke Province with himself as a deputy and de facto ruler. The appointment of a warrior to an important post was intended to show the Emperor that the samurai class was not ready for a purely civilian rule.

Later, a third son of Go-Daigo&#x27;s, Prince Morinaga, was appointed &quot;sei-i taishōgun&quot; together with his brother Norinaga, a move that immediately aroused Ashikaga Takauji&#x27;s hostility. Takauji believed the military class had the right to rule and considered himself not a usurper but, since the Ashikaga descended from a branch of the Minamoto clan, rather a restorer of Minamoto power. When the Hōjō garrison at Rokuhara was destroyed in 1333, he immediately stepped in and installed there his office (bugyōsho). It kept order in the city and in general took over the original&#x27;s function. Extending its authority to controlling travel along highways, issuing passports and exercising rights previously belonging to the shogunate&#x27;s deputies (the Rokuhara Tandai), Takauji showed he believed that samurai political power must continue. His setting himself apart as a representative of the military made him an aggregation point for the warriors&#x27; discontent. Samurai saw him as the man who could bring back the shogunate&#x27;s heyday, and therefore his strength was superior to that of any other samurai, Nitta Yoshisada included. His only obstacle to the shogunate was Prince Morinaga.

== Prince Morinaga ==
Prince Morinaga, with his prestige and his devotion to the civilian government cause, was Takauji&#x27;s natural enemy and could count therefore on the support of his adversaries, among them Nitta Yoshisada, whom Takauji had offended. Tension between the Emperor and the Ashikaga gradually grew, until Takauji had Morinaga arrested on a pretext and first confined him in Kyoto, then transported him to Kamakura, where the Prince was kept prisoner until late August 1335. The situation in Kamakura continued to be tense, with Hōjō supporters staging sporadic revolts here and there. In the course of the same year Hōjō Tokiyuki, son of last regent Takatoki, tried to re-establish the shogunate by force and defeated Tadayoshi in Musashi, in today&#x27;s Kanagawa Prefecture. Tadayoshi had to flee, so before leaving he ordered the beheading of Prince Morinaga. Kamakura was therefore temporarily in Tokiyuki&#x27;s hands. Heard the news, Takauji asked the Emperor to make him &quot;sei-i tai-shōgun&quot; so that he could quell the revolt and help his brother. When his request was denied, Takauji organized his forces and returned to Kamakura without the Emperor&#x27;s permission, defeating the Hōjō. He then installed himself in Kamakura&#x27;s Nikaidō neighborhood. When invited to return to Kyoto, he let it be known through his brother Tadayoshi that he felt safer where he was, and started to build himself a mansion in Ōkura, where first Kamakura &quot;shōgun&quot; Minamoto no Yoritomo&#x27;s residence had been.

== Civil war ==
Kyoto by then was aware that Takauji had assumed wide powers without imperial permission, for example nominating an Uesugi clan member to the post of Constable of Kōzuke, Nitta Yoshisada&#x27;s native province. By late 1335 several thousand of the emperor&#x27;s men were ready to go to Kamakura, while a great army at the command of Kō no Moroyasu was rushing there to help it resist the attack. On November 17, 1335, Tadayoshi issued a message in his brother&#x27;s name asking all samurai to join the Ashikaga and destroy Nitta Yoshisada. The Court, meanwhile, had done the opposite, ordering samurai from all provinces to join Yoshisada and destroy the two Ashikaga. The war started with most samurai convinced that Takauji was the man they needed to have their grievances redressed, and most peasants were persuaded that they had been better off under the shogunate. The campaign was therefore enormously successful for the Ashikaga, with huge numbers of samurai rushing to join the two brothers. By February 23 of the following year Nitta Yoshisada and the Emperor had lost, and Kyoto itself had fallen. On February 25, 1336, Ashikaga Takauji entered the capital and the Kenmu Restoration ended.

== Calendrical peculiarities of the era ==
The Kenmu era is in the anomalous condition of having two different durations. Because Japanese era names (&quot;nengō&quot;) change with the Emperor and the Imperial House split in two after 1336, the Kenmu era was counted by the two sides in two different ways. &quot;Kenmu&quot; is the era after the Genkō era, and it is understood to have spanned the years 1334 through 1336 before the beginning of the &quot;Engen&quot; era, as time was reckoned by the Southern Court; and it is concurrently said to have spanned the years 1334 through 1338 before Ryakuō, as time was reckoned by the rival Northern Court. Because the Southern Court, the loser, is nonetheless considered the legitimate one, its time reckoning is the one used by historians.

<doc id="248975" wikidata="Q683356" url="?curid=248975" title="German submarine U-869">
<text>German submarine &quot;U-869&quot; was a Type IXC/40 U-boat of the German Navy (&quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;) during World War II; her keel was laid down 5 April 1943 by Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau AG Weser of Bremen. It was commissioned on 26 January 1944 with &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Hellmut Neuerburg in command. Neuerburg went down with his boat. The wreck of &quot;U-869&quot; was discovered off the coast of New Jersey in 1991.

==Design==
German Type IXC/40 submarines were slightly larger than the original Type IXCs. &quot;U-869&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-869&quot; was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a Flak M42 as well as two twin C/30 anti-aircraft guns. The boat had a complement of 48.

==Service history==
&quot;U-869&quot; conducted one World War II war patrol without success. It suffered no casualties to her crew until it was lost on 11 February 1945, with all but one of 56 crew members dead. The surviving crew member, Herbert Guschewski, was not on board, as he became ill just before the patrol. Robert Kurson chronicled the story of &quot;U-869&quot;″s finding in the book &quot;Shadow Divers&quot; (2004).

===Engagement near Morocco===

On 28 February 1945, the American destroyer escort and the French submarine chaser &quot;L&#x27;Indiscret&quot; conducted a depth charge attack on a submerged contact in the Atlantic, near Rabat, and reported a kill, although little visible evidence was presented to confirm the kill. Based on the information provided, U.S. Naval Intelligence rated the attacks &quot;G—No Damage&quot;. &quot;U-869&quot; had been previously ordered by Karl Dönitz to move her area of operations from the North American coast to the Gibraltar area. Postwar investigators upgraded the rating from &quot;G—No Damage&quot; to &quot;B—Probably Sunk&quot;, leading to an erroneous historical record that &quot;U-869&quot; was sunk near Gibraltar. For many years this attack was assumed to have been her end.

===Discovery off U.S. coast===
In 1991, Bill Nagle, a former wreck diver and the captain of &quot;Seeker&quot;, learned about a wreck off New Jersey and decided to mount a diving expedition to the site. On 2 September 1991, an unidentified U-boat wreck was discovered 73 meters (240 feet) deep (a hazardous depth for standard scuba diving) off the coast of New Jersey. Nicknamed &quot;U-Who&quot;, the exact identity of the wreck was a matter of frequent debate, and initially the wreck was thought to be either or . The discoverers of &quot;U-Who&quot;, John Chatterton, Richie Kohler, and Kevin Brennan, continued to dive the wreck for the next several years. (Three divers, Steve Feldman, Chris Rouse and &quot;Chrissy&quot; Rouse, died exploring &quot;U-869&quot;.) Eventually, the team recovered a knife inscribed with &quot;Horenburg&quot;, a crew member&#x27;s name. However, they learned at the U-boat archives that &quot;U-869&quot; was supposedly sent to Africa, so this piece of evidence was initially disregarded. A few years later, they found part of the UZO torpedo aiming device, and a spare parts box from the motor room engraved with serial and other identifying numbers. On 31 August 1997 they concluded that the boat they found was &quot;U-869&quot;.

The location of the wreck is approximately .

===Cause of sinking===
The men who found &quot;U-869&quot; believed it was a victim of her own torpedo, which may have become a &quot;circle-runner&quot;. Torpedoes manufactured later in the war had acoustical seeking capability. It was theorized that the torpedo was initially fired in a turning pattern and when it missed her target, it picked up the sound of the submarine&#x27;s propeller. At least two other German U-boats supposedly have been lost due to their own torpedoes: in 1944 and in late 1943. Chatterton and Kohler based their theory largely on a lack of evidence to support other causes for sinking. They claimed there was no reported naval activity in the vicinity, thereby ruling out a sinking by attack. Moreover, the damage to the hull was from the outside and thereby ruled out an internal explosion. This problem also affected the US submarine force at least twice, as seen with and .

Gary Gentile, a noted wreck diver, researcher, and author, rejects Chatteron and Kohler&#x27;s theory. He cites attack logs and eyewitness accounts from the crew of two destroyer escorts suggesting that the U-boat was initially damaged with a hedgehog launched by the and then subsequently damaged with a depth charge by the accompanying .

The United States Coast Guard, in its official evaluation of the evidence, discarded the circle-running torpedo theory and awarded the sinking to the two destroyers. This was confirmed by Marlyn Berkey, who was on a destroyer as part of the Pacific fleet entering New York Harbor after the war&#x27;s end; the submarine showed up on sonar, Berkey&#x27;s destroyer depth charged the sub, it sank as evidenced by oil and debris that floated on the surface; the destroyer&#x27;s crew was allowed to place a broom upside down atop the mainmast coming into New York, which meant &quot;clean sweep&quot;. Contributing to their findings are two damage holes in the wreck of &quot;U-869&quot;, which are more consistent with the attack reports that cited two explosions than with the circle runner theory which would only explain one hole. The official records state that &quot;U-869&quot; was destroyed on 11 February 1945 by two U.S. destroyer escorts, &quot;Howard D. Crow&quot; and &quot;Koiner&quot;. John Chatterton, one of the divers who discovered &quot;U-869&quot; in 1991, states in &quot;Wreck Diving Magazine&quot; his belief that the two U.S. destroyer escorts attacked the wreck of &quot;U-869&quot; after the U-boat had been struck by her own torpedo.

===Survival of crew member===

One crew member survived by virtue of not having been aboard. Second Radio Officer Herbert Guschewski came down with pneumonia and pleurisy shortly before the boat&#x27;s departure. Like others, Guschewski did not learn what happened to the crew until 1999. He watched a program which eventually became the PBS &quot;NOVA&quot; episode &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Lost Sub&quot; and contacted the producers shortly afterward, who interviewed him and placed a portion of it in the 2000 American broadcast.

<text>Cobourg ( ) is a town in the Canadian province of Ontario, located in Southern Ontario east of Toronto and east of Oshawa. It is the largest town in and seat of Northumberland County. Its nearest neighbour is Port Hope, to the west. It is located along Highway 401 (exits 472 and 474) and the former Highway 2 (now Northumberland County Road 2). To the south, Cobourg borders Lake Ontario. To the north, east and west, it is surrounded by Hamilton Township.

==History==
The land which present-day Cobourg occupies was previously inhabited by Mississauga (Anishinaabe-speaking) peoples. The settlements that make up today&#x27;s Cobourg were founded by United Empire Loyalists in 1798 within Northumberland County, Home District, Province of Upper Canada. Some of the founding fathers and early settlers were Eliud Nickerson, Joseph Ash, Zacheus Burnham and Asa Allworth Burnham. The Town was originally a group of smaller villages such as Amherst and Hardscrabble, which were later named Hamilton. In 1808 it became the district town for the Newcastle District. It was renamed Cobourg in 1819, in recognition of the marriage of Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (later Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who would later become King of Belgium).
By the 1830s, Cobourg had become a regional centre, mostly due to its fine harbour on Lake Ontario. In 1835 the Upper Canada Academy was established in Cobourg by Egerton Ryerson and the Wesleyan Conference of Bishops. On 1 July 1837, Cobourg was officially incorporated as a town. In 1841 the Upper Canada Academy&#x27;s name was changed to Victoria College. In 1842 Victoria College was granted powers to confer degrees. Victoria College remained in Cobourg until 1892, when it was moved to Toronto and federated with the University of Toronto. In 1842, John Strachan founded the Diocesan Theological Institute in Cobourg, an Anglican seminary that became integrated into the University of Trinity College in Toronto in 1852.

===The Railway to Rice Lake ===

The timber and other resources of Cobourg&#x27;s large hinterland were identified as the key to its prosperity, and if they could be brought to the harbour, Lake Ontario opened up a large and prosperous market. Peterborough to the north, founded in 1825 by Peter Robinson, had become the principal source area, and in the 1830s the waterways were still the prime method of bulk transport. Rice Lake and the Otonabee River were brought into use when James Gray Bethune established a steamer running across the lake and up the Otonabee which was navigable through to Peterborough. This meant goods and passengers could be brought at least to the south shore of Rice Lake. The remaining 8 miles of rough tracks was viable for passengers and light goods, but no use for the valuable timber and mine products. By 1835, only 10 years after the first steam railway in the world, there was active discussion about building a railway up to what later became Harwood. However, the townspeople invested instead in a plank road, using 300,000 feet of 3-inch wooden planks, allowing horse-drawn vehicles to haul heavy goods. By 1850 the plank road was breaking up, and was impassible in wet conditions, so the railway scheme was revived.

By 1852, there was considerable enthusiasm for the railway project within the town. River traffic had become seen as yesterday&#x27;s solution by this time, so the plans were expanded to include a long bridge across Rice Lake, to take the railway right up to Peterborough. By 1854 the rails reached the shore of the lake, and it found good work transporting passengers and nearly 2 million feet of lumber from the Rice Lake down to Cobourg that summer. However, revenue from the project had to be diverted into building an ill-fated bridge, using hundreds of wooden trestles, 31 Burr Truss spans, and a centre-pivot swing bridge to allow boats to pass. The prime mover locally for getting the Railway company off the ground was D&#x27;Arcy E. Boulton, a lawyer based in Cobourg, who enthused the town with the plan. They agreed to begin funding the scheme that was initially expected to cost £150,000, but ended leaving many people with worthless railway bonds and the town council with a debt that was only finally repaid in the 1930s. The man appointed to manage the project was Samuel Zimmerman, who had previously been instrumental in building the Great Western Railway (Ontario). The bridge was constructed over the summer of 1854 and was officially opened on 29 December that year. Three days later, it collapsed when ice movements shifted the trestles out of line, splintering the Burr Truss sections. The proposed solution was to stabilise the trestles (or &#x27;stilts&#x27; as their critics dubbed them) by an infill of soil, which did happen on the southern side, still visible as a strip of land still remaining running into the lake near Harwood. But funds were not forthcoming for the northern side, and winter ice and shifting lake mud meant that it was frequently unusable.

A further problem emerged when Port Hope, not far along the coast, pursued its own plans for a Railway to Peterborough. In 1857, the Port Hope and Lindsay line was constructed, and the following year opened a branch to Peterborough, going round the western end of the lake, in direct competition with the struggling Cobourg route. The response of the Cobourg directors was to oust D.E. Boulton, who then invested in the Port Hope line. Conflicts of interest among various personnel resulted in the deliberate removal of the bolts on sections of the bridge in early 1861, ensuring that when the ice moved again the bridge was destroyed, and this time it was left unrepaired. The railway reverted to linking Cobourg harbour with Harwood and the Rice Lake water traffic.

In 1865, the railway was bought by a consortium of Pittsburgh steel manufacturers, who had already bought the Marmora Iron quarries north-east of Rice Lake. They established an iron-ore supply route using barges up the Trent River and across Rice Lake to the railway at Harwood. From there it was brought along the Railway to Cobourg Harbour for shipment across Lake Ontario to feed the steel mills of America. This provided a steady income for the railway and the town until the ore ran out in 1878. It also had two longer term spin-offs in the form of a rail car company and the beginnings of a tourist industry.

====Crossen Car Works====

When the iron ore scheme was getting underway, a small iron foundry based in Cobourg, was approached to cast the wheels and frames of wagons to move the Marmora iron ore down to the harbour. James Crossen saw an opportunity to combine his cast-iron products with the abundant local timber to produce railway rolling stock. With the foundry located near both the Cobourg line and train station of the Grand Trunk Railway, which had been built along the shore of Lake Ontario in 1856, it was well placed to expand as Canada&#x27;s railway network grew. It was later named the Crossen Car Manufacturing Company and went on to become the largest builder of timber-framed rail cars in Canada, making everything from coal and freight wagons through to dining cars and first-class carriages. By 1910, wood was going out of date, when all-steel cars took over, and in 1915 the company, unable to adapt, went into liquidation, and parts of the site reverted to being an iron foundry. A replica of one of the Crossen ore cars was built in 2016 and is on display near Cobourg waterfront.

====Wealthy Americans====
The connections and trade links which developed through the iron shipments brought many American industrialists to Cobourg, which became a popular summer destination. High class hotels were established, followed in the late 19th century and early 20th century by enormous summer homes for wealthy Americans, a few of which still stand today. One notable home, on King Street East, later became the Brookside School, a youth detention centre. (It has now closed, and the property stands idle.) A major ferry service connected Cobourg and Rochester, New York from 1907 to 1952, transporting passengers and cargo across Lake Ontario, allowing Americans to reach the town more readily.

===Victoria Hall===
For a brief moment in 1856, the town, with both its new railway link to the interior and an east–west rail connection along the Grand Trunk Railway, was feeling secure in its future prosperity, and thought a new Town Hall would encourage further investment and be an asset to the area. Victoria Hall stands at the heart of the downtown, a building that now serves as the town hall, as well as home of the Art Gallery of Northumberland, the Cobourg Concert Hall, and an Old Bailey-style courtroom that is now used as the Council chamber. Victoria Hall was designed by architect Kivas Tully. The landmark is known for its impressive stone work. Charles Thomas Thomas (1820-1867), an English-born master stonecarver and building contractor, executed the fine stone carvings, including the bearded faced keystone over the main entrance into the building. Victoria Hall was officially opened on September 6, 1860 by the Prince of Wales, later to become King Edward VII. At that time, Cobourg was a significant town in the Province of Canada, and some townspeople felt that Cobourg would be a suitable capital for the newly united provinces; this privilege went to Ottawa, Ontario, however.

===Heritage Centre===
One of the oldest buildings in the town was for many years known as The Barracks, suggesting military connections. However it is equally likely that it was built for industrial uses, either in the very early 1800s or as a malting house and brewery by James Calcutt in the early 1830s. It probably served that purpose until a larger brewery was built by the McKechnies in 1863. The old stone-built building had a variety of industrial and storage purposes, and twenty different owners. In 2000 it was acquired in a run-down state by the Cobourg Museum Foundation, who have restored it and it is now open as the Sifton-Cook Heritage Centre.

=== Cobourg Jail ===
In 1906 on 77 Albert Street the Cobourg Jail, originally referred to as The County Jail, began to house inmates. Over time the Cobourg jail continued to expand to house the increasing population of inmates. In 1998 the jail closed and the year after in 1999 was purchased by private buyers. The jail has since been converted to a tourist attraction called the King George Inn with the jail still intact to see or stay in. Additionally, a family restaurant was implemented for guests and non-guests of the hotel.

===Crash landing===
On 20 December 1951, Cobourg experienced media attention as a chartered Curtiss C-46 Commando airplane, bound for Newark, New Jersey, made an emergency landing in local farmer Charles Wilson&#x27;s field, alongside Highway 2 and Roger&#x27;s Road. The pilot had lost his way after losing radio contact, and unwittingly drifted north. The 44 passengers and three crew escaped unhurt, but extremely cold in the sub-zero temperatures. The plane, having crash landed on deep snow, was able to be repaired and the field smoothed out enough for it to get airborne again.

Cobourg was the site of No. 26 Ordnance Depot, later Canadian Forces Station Cobourg, from 1953 to 1971.

===Regeneration===
Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, the town invested heavily in purchasing property along the waterfront and beautifying the area. A boardwalk was developed to connect the harbour and large sandy beach while further pathways were created to encompass Victoria Park and the historic downtown. Because of this renewal and revitalization, many community activities now revolve in and around these spaces.

==Climate==
Cobourg has a humid continental climate (Dfb) with warm summers and cold winters.

==Transportation==
Highway 401 and Northumberland County Road 2 (formerly Highway 2) pass through town. County Road 45 (formerly Highway 45) begins in Cobourg and heads north-east to Norwood.

The Canadian Pacific and Canadian National main railway lines (Toronto – Ottawa/Montreal) traverse the town. Via Rail offers passenger service to Cobourg railway station with multiple daily departures on the Toronto – Ottawa/Montreal route.

Cobourg Transit is a fully accessible community transit system that provides daily bus service to the town. The community transit system ends its runs by 7pm, which can hamper travel for those without other means of transportation. It formerly ran until 9:30pm however the hours were reduced.

The Ontario Waterfront Trail passes through Cobourg and cyclists can be found moving through daily during the warmer months.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Cobourg had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The Town is responsible for delivering a variety of local services, including planning, transit, fire and police protection, and the maintenance of local roads and parks. Certain responsibilities, such as waste management or paramedic services, are the responsibility of Northumberland County.

There are six advisory committees appointed by the city council. These bodies are made up of city councillors.

* Accessibility Advisory Committee - effective 2023
* Civic Awards Advisory Committee - to re-convene in 2024
* Cobourg Heritage Advisory Committee - effective 2023

* Planning and Development Advisory Committee - no longer active
* Sustainability and Climate Change Emergency Advisory Committee - no longer active
* Transportation Advisory Committee, Zero Emission Ad Hoc Committee (on hold) 

The Town maintains an independent municipal police force, the Cobourg Police Service, which provides policing services to all areas of the municipality as well as seasonal by-law enforcement services in the neighbouring Township of Hamilton.

The Town of Cobourg had an approved operating budget of in 2023 and a capital budget plan of . The town&#x27;s revenues include subsidies from the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario (for programs mandated by those governments). The town&#x27;s largest operating expenditure is the Harbour Rehabilitation project costing nearly in 2023.

==Education==
Public education in Cobourg is under the management of the Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board, and Catholic education is by the Peterborough Victoria Northumberland and Clarington Catholic District School Board.

Cobourg also has a satellite campus of Fleming College.

In 1871, Cobourg&#x27;s first Collegiate Institute was erected on King Street East. In 1899, the student population at the original Cobourg Collegiate Institute had outgrown the school. New plans for another school on the west end of King Street were put in place and the new school building on 135 King Street was built. This new building was called the West high school and the older school building was then named the East high school. The West high school had many additions in the 1920s as the school continued to grow. The two schools co-existed for 116 years until the closing of both schools in 2015. The purpose of closing the two schools was to bring them back together with the fabrication of a brand new Cobourg Collegiate Institute in 2015. The new school was built on the property of the old east high school. The old west high school was not demolished, but renamed William Academy Cobourg West and is a functioning co-ed private school for grades 7-12.

==Attractions==

Cobourg retains its small-town atmosphere, in part due to the downtown and surrounding residential area&#x27;s status as a Heritage Conservation District. The downtown is a well-preserved example of a traditional small-town main street. Victoria Hall, the town hall completed in 1860, is a National Historic Site of Canada. The oldest building in the town is now open as the Sifton Cook Heritage Centre and operated by the Cobourg Museum Foundation.

Cobourg has several parks. The Cobourg Waterfront Festival, held in Victoria Park and the nearby beach and harbour, is an annual arts and crafts event occurring on Canada Day. It began in 1987 as part of the town&#x27;s sesquicentennial celebrations, and was conceived by the Art Gallery of Northumberland&#x27;s former Director/Curator Peter Tulumello and former Concert Hall Manager Mark Finnan. Cobourg&#x27;s oldest annual event, the Cobourg Highland Games, was started in 1963 in Donegan Park by Dave Carr to celebrate the Scottish culture in the area. The event is now held in Victoria Park in June.

Cobourg&#x27;s beach, Victoria Park Beach, is used as a location for volleyball tournaments, events, beach days, family picnics and other events. The beach is equipped with a splash park, playground set, park area for eating, local restaurants and a pier. Additionally, there is a small trailer park located directly next to the beach. There are lifeguards on duty some days and it is safe to swim and play in. Close to the downtown, tourists can shop in local shops and eat out at many of Cobourg&#x27;s restaurants.

Cobourg is home to the Port Hope Drive-In, Canada&#x27;s oldest drive-in.

<text>In calculus, the product rule (or Leibniz rule or Leibniz product rule) is a formula used to find the derivatives of products of two or more functions. For two functions, it may be stated in Lagrange&#x27;s notation as formula_1 or in Leibniz&#x27;s notation as formula_2

The rule may be extended or generalized to products of three or more functions, to a rule for higher-order derivatives of a product, and to other contexts.

== Discovery ==
Discovery of this rule is credited to Gottfried Leibniz, who demonstrated it using &quot;infinitesimals&quot; (a precursor to the modern differential). (However, J. M. Child, a translator of Leibniz&#x27;s papers, argues that it is due to Isaac Barrow.) Here is Leibniz&#x27;s argument: Let &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; be functions. Then &quot;d(uv)&quot; is the same thing as the difference between two successive &quot;uv&quot;&#x27;s; let one of these be &quot;uv&quot;, and the other &quot;u+du&quot; times &quot;v+dv&quot;; then:
formula_3

Since the term &quot;du&quot;·&quot;dv&quot; is &quot;negligible&quot; (compared to &quot;du&quot; and &quot;dv&quot;), Leibniz concluded that
formula_4
and this is indeed the differential form of the product rule. If we divide through by the differential &quot;dx&quot;, we obtain
formula_5
which can also be written in Lagrange&#x27;s notation as
formula_6

== Examples ==
*Suppose we want to differentiate formula_7 By using the product rule, one gets the derivative formula_8 (since the derivative of formula_9 is formula_10 and the derivative of the sine function is the cosine function).
*One special case of the product rule is the constant multiple rule, which states: if is a number, and formula_11 is a differentiable function, then formula_12 is also differentiable, and its derivative is formula_13 This follows from the product rule since the derivative of any constant is zero. This, combined with the sum rule for derivatives, shows that differentiation is linear.
*The rule for integration by parts is derived from the product rule, as is (a weak version of) the quotient rule. (It is a &quot;weak&quot; version in that it does not prove that the quotient is differentiable but only says what its derivative is it is differentiable.)

== Proofs ==

=== Limit definition of derivative ===

Let and suppose that and are each differentiable at . We want to prove that is differentiable at and that its derivative, , is given by . To do this, formula_14 (which is zero, and thus does not change the value) is added to the numerator to permit its factoring, and then properties of limits are used.
formula_15
The fact that formula_16 follows from the fact that differentiable functions are continuous.

=== Linear approximations ===
By definition, if formula_17 are differentiable at formula_18, then we can write linear approximations:
formula_19 and formula_20
where the error terms are small with respect to &quot;h&quot;: that is, formula_21 also written formula_22. Then:
formula_23
The &quot;error terms&quot; consist of items such as formula_24 and formula_25 which are easily seen to have magnitude formula_26 Dividing by formula_27 and taking the limit formula_28 gives the result.

=== Quarter squares ===
This proof uses the chain rule and the quarter square function formula_29 with derivative formula_30. We have:
formula_31
and differentiating both sides gives:
formula_32

=== Multivariable chain rule ===
The product rule can be considered a special case of the chain rule for several variables, applied to the multiplication function formula_33:
formula_34

=== Non-standard analysis ===
Let &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; be continuous functions in &quot;x&quot;, and let &quot;dx&quot;, &quot;du&quot; and &quot;dv&quot; be infinitesimals within the framework of non-standard analysis, specifically the hyperreal numbers. Using st to denote the standard part function that associates to a hyperreal number the real infinitely close to it, this gives
formula_35
This was essentially Leibniz&#x27;s proof exploiting the transcendental law of homogeneity (in place of the standard part above).

===Smooth infinitesimal analysis===
In the context of Lawvere&#x27;s approach to infinitesimals, let formula_36 be a nilsquare infinitesimal. Then formula_37 and formula_38, so that
formula_39
since formula_40 Dividing by formula_36 then gives formula_42 or formula_43.

===Logarithmic differentiation===

Let formula_44. Taking the absolute value of each function and the natural log of both sides of the equation, 
formula_45
Applying properties of the absolute value and logarithms, 
formula_46 
Taking the logarithmic derivative of both sides and then solving for formula_47:
formula_48
Solving for formula_49 and substituting back formula_50 for formula_51 gives:
formula_52
Note: Taking the absolute value of the functions is necessary for the logarithmic differentiation of functions that may have negative values, as logarithms are only real-valued for positive arguments. This works because formula_53, which justifies taking the absolute value of the functions for logarithmic differentiation.

== Generalizations ==
=== Product of more than two factors ===
The product rule can be generalized to products of more than two factors. For example, for three factors we have
formula_54
For a collection of functions formula_55, we have
formula_56

The logarithmic derivative provides a simpler expression of the last form, as well as a direct proof that does not involve any recursion. The &quot;logarithmic derivative&quot; of a function , denoted here , is the derivative of the logarithm of the function. It follows that 
formula_57
Using that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors, the sum rule for derivatives gives immediately
formula_58
The last above expression of the derivative of a product is obtained by multiplying both members of this equation by the product of the formula_59

=== Higher derivatives ===

It can also be generalized to the general Leibniz rule for the &quot;n&quot;th derivative of a product of two factors, by symbolically expanding according to the binomial theorem:
formula_60

Applied at a specific point &quot;x&quot;, the above formula gives: 
formula_61

Furthermore, for the &quot;n&quot;th derivative of an arbitrary number of factors, one has a similar formula with multinomial coefficients:
formula_62

=== Higher partial derivatives ===
For partial derivatives, we have
formula_63
where the index runs through all subsets of , and is the cardinality of . For example, when ,
formula_64

=== Banach space ===
Suppose &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot; are Banach spaces (which includes Euclidean space) and &quot;B&quot; : &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; is a continuous bilinear operator. Then &quot;B&quot; is differentiable, and its derivative at the point (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) in &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot; is the linear map &quot;D&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;)&quot;B&quot; : &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; given by
formula_65

This result can be extended to more general topological vector spaces.

=== In vector calculus ===
The product rule extends to various product operations of vector functions on formula_66:

* For scalar multiplication: formula_67
* For dot product: formula_68
* For cross product of vector functions on formula_69: formula_70

There are also analogues for other analogs of the derivative: if &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are scalar fields then there is a product rule with the gradient:
formula_71

Such a rule will hold for any continuous bilinear product operation. Let &quot;B&quot; : &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; be a continuous bilinear map between vector spaces, and let &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; be differentiable functions into &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, respectively. The only properties of multiplication used in the proof using the limit definition of derivative is that multiplication is continuous and bilinear. So for any continuous bilinear operation,
formula_72
This is also a special case of the product rule for bilinear maps in Banach space.

=== Derivations in abstract algebra and differential geometry ===
In abstract algebra, the product rule is the defining property of a derivation. In this terminology, the product rule states that the derivative operator is a derivation on functions. 

In differential geometry, a tangent vector to a manifold &quot;M&quot; at a point &quot;p&quot; may be defined abstractly as an operator on real-valued functions which behaves like a directional derivative at &quot;p&quot;: that is, a linear functional &quot;v&quot; which is a derivation, formula_73
Generalizing (and dualizing) the formulas of vector calculus to an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold &quot;M,&quot; one may take differential forms of degrees &quot;k&quot; and &quot;l&quot;, denoted formula_74, with the wedge or exterior product operation formula_75, as well as the exterior derivative formula_76. Then one has the graded Leibniz rule: formula_77

== Applications ==
Among the applications of the product rule is a proof that
formula_78
when &quot;n&quot; is a positive integer (this rule is true even if &quot;n&quot; is not positive or is not an integer, but the proof of that must rely on other methods). The proof is by mathematical induction on the exponent &quot;n&quot;. If &quot;n&quot; = 0 then &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; is constant and &quot;nx&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1 = 0. The rule holds in that case because the derivative of a constant function is 0. If the rule holds for any particular exponent &quot;n&quot;, then for the next value, &quot;n&quot; + 1, we have
formula_79
Therefore, if the proposition is true for &quot;n&quot;, it is true also for &quot;n&quot; + 1, and therefore for all natural &quot;n&quot;.

<doc id="248990" wikidata="Q7739298" url="?curid=248990" title="The Hee Bee Gee Bees">
<text>The Hee Bee Gee Bees was a fictitious pop group which parodied pop groups and performers in the early 1980s, consisting of Angus Deayton, Michael Fenton Stevens, and Philip Pope of the UK radio series &quot;Radio Active&quot;.

Their first single was &quot;Meaningless Songs (in Very High Voices)&quot; by the Hee Bee Gee Bees, a parody of the Bee Gees. The &#x27;band&#x27; consisted of the three Cribb (Gibb) brothers; Garry (Barry), Norris (Maurice) and Dobbin (Robin), performed respectively by Deayton, Fenton Stevens, and Pope. It was written by Pope and Richard Curtis, released by Original Records in 1980, reached number two in the Australian singles chart and made an appearance on the UK Indie Charts.

Two albums were subsequently released under the &quot;Hee Bee Gee Bees&quot; name, featuring parodies of various pop groups that had originally been featured on &quot;Radio Active&quot;. Tracks included parodies of Supertramp (&quot;Scatological Song&quot; by Supertrash), Michael Jackson (&quot;Up the Wall&quot; by Jack Michaelson), Status Quo (&quot;Boring Song&quot; by Status Quid), The Police (&quot;Too Depressed to Commit Suicide&quot; by The PeeCees), David Bowie (&quot;Quite Ahead of My Time&quot; by David Bowwow), Gary Numan (&quot;Are Trains Electric?&quot; by Gary Inhuman) and others. The first album was recorded in the Strawberry Studios in Stockport, and featured 10cc and Sad Café studio musicians. The second album was recorded in and mixed at Silo Studios in London, with Les Davidson (guitar) Steve Shone (bass) and Dave Early (drums). The music was written by Pope, with lyrics by Deayton and other &quot;Radio Active&quot; scriptwriters.

Fenton Stevens and Pope later collaborated on the parody song &quot;The Chicken Song&quot;, which reached number 1 in the UK in 1986.

<doc id="248994" wikidata="Q1002993" url="?curid=248994" title="List of Formula One constructors">
<text>Formula One, abbreviated to F1, is the highest class of open-wheel racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), motorsport&#x27;s world governing body. The &quot;formula&quot; in the name alludes to a series of rules established by the FIA to which all participants and vehicles are required to conform. Each year, the F1 World Championship season is held, consisting of a series of races, known as , held usually on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets. Constructors are awarded points based on the finishing position of each of their two drivers at each Grand Prix, and the constructor who accumulates the most points over each championship is crowned that year&#x27;s World Constructors&#x27; Champion. As of the 2024 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, there have been 172 Formula One constructors who have raced at least one of the 1,125 FIA World Championship races since the first such event, the 1950 British Grand Prix.

Constructors are people or corporate entities which design key parts of Formula One cars that have competed or are intended to compete in the FIA World Championship. Since 1981, it has been a requirement that each competitor must have the exclusive rights to the use of certain key parts of their car; in 2018, these parts were the survival cell, the front impact structure, the roll structures and bodywork.

Ferrari holds the record for the most Constructors&#x27; and Drivers&#x27; Championships won with sixteen and fifteen, respectively. Ferrari also holds the record for the most wins by a constructor with , the most pole positions with , the most points with , and the most podiums with . Ferrari has also entered more than any other constructor with entries and also maintains the record for the most Grand Prix starts with . The most recent constructor to make their debut was RB, which debuted at the .

==Terminology==
In Formula One racing the terms &quot;constructor&quot; and &quot;entrant&quot; have specific and differing meanings. An entrant is the person or corporate entity that registers a car and driver for a race, and is then responsible for preparing and maintaining that car during the race weekend. As a result of this preparation role and active involvement in the running of the race, the term &quot;team&quot; has become commonly applied to an entrant organisation. Statisticians do not always agree on how to count statistics related to these entities.

===Constructors===

Under Article 6.3 of the FIA Sporting Regulations, &quot;A constructor is the person (including any corporate or unincorporated body) which designs the Listed Parts set out in Appendix 6. The make of an engine or chassis is the name attributed to it by its constructor.&quot; These &quot;listed parts&quot; include the survival cell, the front impact structure, the roll structures and bodywork. However, if the chassis and engine are made by different entities, the constructor comprises both (e.g. McLaren-Mercedes, Lotus-Climax etc.), with the name of the chassis constructor being placed before that of the engine constructor. As both chassis and engine are included in the constructor name, chassis run with different engines are counted as two separate constructors and score points separately. This occurred for the last time in the season when the Tyrrell team ran their chassis powered by both Ford and Renault engines, scored points with both engines and thus finishing 9th as &quot;Tyrrell-Ford&quot; and 10th as &quot;Tyrrell-Renault&quot; in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship.

Under article 6.2 of the FIA sporting regulations, &quot;The title of Formula One World Champion Constructor will be awarded to the competitor which has scored the highest number of points&quot;. From the inaugural season of the World Constructors&#x27; Championship in up until the season only the highest-scoring driver in each race for each constructor contributed points towards the World Constructors&#x27; Championship (then officially as the &quot;International Cup for Formula One Constructors&quot;); since the season points from all cars entered by each constructor have counted towards their championship total.

===Teams===
Since the season the FIA have required that Formula One entrants own the intellectual rights to the chassis that they enter, and so the distinction between the terms &quot;entrant&quot; and &quot;constructor&quot;, and hence also &quot;team&quot;, have become less pronounced, though the intellectual rights of engines may still be owned by a different entity. That season also saw the &quot;International Cup for Formula One Constructors&quot; be officially renamed to the &quot;World Constructors&#x27; Championship&quot;.

Before this time, constructors were free to sell their chassis to as many other teams as they liked. Brabham and Lotus chassis were used extensively by other teams during the 1960s and 1970s and several quite competitive privateer teams never built their own chassis. Rob Walker Racing Team was the most successful example, being responsible for the first victories in Formula One for both Cooper and Lotus. The concept of a &quot;works&quot; or &quot;factory&quot; team (i.e. the official team of the company producing the cars, as opposed to a customer team which buys them off the shelf) therefore applied to chassis in the same way as it does in rallying and sports car racing.

There have been some recent exceptions where a specialist company, not itself entered in the championship, has been commissioned to design and build a chassis for a team, e.g. Lola built cars for the Larrousse team (-) and the Scuderia Italia team () and Dallara built cars for the Scuderia Italia team (-). Larousse had their points from the season erased after the FIA decided that they had falsely nominated themselves and not Lola as the chassis constructor. In , the new Arrows team which had been established by former Shadow personnel was sued by Shadow on the grounds that the Arrows FA/1 car was a copy of Shadow&#x27;s DN9 – a view upheld by the UK High Court, which placed a ban on Arrows racing the FA/1. There have been more recent cases with Ligier (1995), Sauber (2004), Scuderia Toro Rosso (2006–2007) and Super Aguri (2007–2008) where teams have been accused of using a chassis produced by another constructor (respectively Benetton, Ferrari, Red Bull Racing and Honda). No action was taken against any of these teams, the sporting authorities being satisfied in each case that the team owned the intellectual property to the chassis they raced.

From the middle of the season (the 1973 Belgian Grand Prix) until the end of the season, each team had permanent racing numbers from race to race throughout the season. Between the and seasons the numbers were based on the teams&#x27; finishing positions in the 1973 Constructors&#x27; Championship (with slight modifications, e.g. Ferrari&#x27;s traditional numbers were 11–12 until and 27–28 from onwards) and each team only changed numbers if they had the driver who had won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in the previous season – the winning driver taking the number 1 and his teammate the number 2, and the team that had previously had those numbers switching to the newly vacated ones. Between and the numbers were based on the teams&#x27; finishing positions in the Constructors&#x27; Championship from the previous season, with numbers 1 and 2 assigned to the defending champion and his teammate. During the period of 1974–1995 Tyrrell was the only team to keep the same numbers (3 and 4) every season. Since , racing numbers have been assigned to drivers instead of teams.

The number of cars entered by one team into a single race was not strictly limited in the 1950s and early 1960s. Since the season teams were generally allowed to enter only two regular cars, with the third car reserved for an occasional driver. This rule was further promoted in the season when the permanent racing numbers were assigned to each team in pairs, with the third car having the racing number out of the pair. Entering more than three cars was exceptionally tolerated, most notably regarding the BRM team in the and seasons. However, many teams during this period entered only two cars, e.g. Ferrari have entered no more than two cars (with one exception at the 1976 Italian Grand Prix in connection with Lauda&#x27;s comeback) every season since . Since the season the FIA have required that teams enter no more than two cars for a race; during this season Renault became the last team to have entered three cars for a race at the 1985 German Grand Prix, but only two of their cars were eligible for championship points.

==== Team&#x27;s nationality====
Unlike drivers who are required to compete in the FIA Formula One World Championship under the nationality of their passport and in case of a multiple citizenship they can choose their &quot;official&quot; nationality, the FIA&#x27;s International Sporting Code states that teams competing in the FIA Formula One World Championship shall compete under the nationality of their parent National Automobile Club that issued their FIA racing licence. On the basis of this regulation, despite the fact that most current teams are based in the UK, this country is officially represented in Formula One only by teams holding a racing licence issued by the British National Sporting Authority.

Teams take the nationality of their parent National Automobile Club that issued their licence for the period of validity of that licence and the change of the nationality is allowed. Several teams changed their nationality during their competition in Formula One, some of them even twice (e.g. Shadow in from American to British, Benetton in from British to Italian, Red Bull in from British to Austrian, Renault in from French to British and in back to French). At the 1997 German Grand Prix Benetton became the only team to have achieved victories while racing under two different nationalities. The team&#x27;s nationality, determined by a racing licence that a team holds, subsequently determines a national anthem played after a race on the podium in honour of a winning team following a national anthem played in honour of a winning driver.

Before the arrival of sponsorship liveries in the season the team&#x27;s nationality also determined the colour of a car entered by the team; thus, Italian teams&#x27; cars were &quot;rosso corsa&quot; red, French were &quot;bleu de France&quot; blue, and British (with several exceptions, such as cars entered by teams Rob Walker, Brabham and McLaren) were British racing green. Since the licence is given to a team and not to a constructor, privateer teams entering cars built by constructors from another country before the 1968 season painted cars in the national colour of their home country, e.g. the French Guy Ligier&#x27;s privateer team entered cars painted in &quot;bleu de France&quot; blue in and seasons despite the fact that they were built by the British constructor Cooper.

Relating to the team&#x27;s nationality because of teams&#x27; bases in Britain several mistakes occurred on official entry lists issued by or podium ceremonies organized by the FIA or race organisers, e.g. Wolf holding the Canadian nationality and Shadow (in ) and Penske both holding the American nationality all identified as the British teams by official entry lists, or the British national anthem played on the podium in honour of the Irish-licensed Jordan team and the Austrian-licensed Red Bull team when they achieved their maiden victories at the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix and 2009 Chinese Grand Prix respectively.

==Constructors for the 2025 season==
:&quot;Correct as of the &quot;
&quot;Note:&quot; Until a works team of every constructor was licensed in the country where it was really based. In 1965 Japanese-licensed Honda moved their works team from Tokyo, Japan to Amsterdam, Netherlands, followed in by the American-licensed Anglo American Racers team which was based in Rye, East Sussex, United Kingdom. Since the early 2000s most teams have been based in the United Kingdom, and either licensed there or in another country, with the rest based in Italy (Maranello and Faenza) and Switzerland (Hinwil).

== Privateer teams ==
From the inaugural 1950 British Grand Prix until the 1981 Spanish Grand Prix numerous privateer teams entered cars, built by another companies as their constructors, in World Championship events. Some of them, such as Tyrrell and Williams, later began to build their own chassis and thus became &quot;constructors&quot; as well as &quot;works teams&quot;. At the 1981 Spanish Grand Prix the Equipe Banco Occidental team became the last privateer team to have entered a car for a race alongside a works team when they entered a Williams car alongside the Williams works team. During the period of the – seasons, privateer teams won 20 World Championship races in total. Only once (the Matra International team in ) a privateer team helped a constructor (Matra) to win the World Constructors&#x27; Championship and a driver (Jackie Stewart) to win the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. The following are privateer teams which never built their own chassis, and thus were not &quot;constructors&quot;:

<text>Formula One, abbreviated to F1, is currently the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), motorsport&#x27;s world governing body. The &quot;formula&quot; in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and vehicles must conform. The Formula One World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as , usually held on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets. The results of each race are combined to determine two annual championships, one for drivers (World Drivers&#x27; Championship), and one for constructors (World Constructors&#x27; Championship).

This list is for the circuits that hosted World Championship races from 1950 until now. The terms &quot;Formula One race&quot; and &quot;World Championship race&quot; were not always synonymous throughout history – see for a detailed explanation.

==History==

The first World Championship Grand Prix was held in at Silverstone; since then 77 circuits in total have hosted a Grand Prix. A lot of classic (older) circuits have hosted using different configurations throughout their history: Nürburgring, Spa-Francorchamps, Monza, etc. Taking Nürburgring as an example, the first World Championship race there used the configuration, but concerns over safety meant that more recent have used a shorter, safer circuit. Formula One circuits were predominantly in Europe during the early years of the championship; as the sport has expanded, so has the location of its circuits. The expansion into Asia and America has been a recent occurrence. Of the 20 circuits that hosted a Grand Prix in , nearly half were not on the calendar before . The Autodromo Nazionale Monza has hosted the most World Championship races; the only season it did not host a race was in , when the Italian Grand Prix was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari. The Las Vegas Strip Circuit became the 77th circuit to host a Grand Prix, when it held the Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2023; this is the latest addition to this list. The longest circuit to have hosted a Grand Prix is the Pescara Circuit, which hosted the 1957 Pescara Grand Prix: the long circuit in Pescara, Italy, held the annual Coppa Acerbo race, and in it was the only time that this race was included as part of the World Championship, a race which Stirling Moss won.

As some circuits have hosted using different configurations, the most recent configuration used is listed in the table below.

==Circuits==
* The &quot;Circuit&quot; column uses the name contemporary to the last time the circuit was used in Formula One.
* The &quot;Map&quot; column shows a diagram of the latest configuration on current tracks and the last configuration used on past tracks.

<text>Port Hope is a municipality in Southern Ontario, Canada, about east of Toronto and west of Kingston. It is at the mouth of the Ganaraska River on the north shore of Lake Ontario, in the west end of Northumberland County. The private Trinity College School opened here in 1868.

==History==

The Cayuga people inhabited the area in the early 17th century and there was a Mississauga village named Cochingomink also in the 17th century.

In 1778 a fur trade post was established and the settlement was known as Smith&#x27;s Creek.

In 1793, Loyalists from the northern colonies became the first permanent settlers of European heritage in the area, as the Crown granted them land as compensation for being forced to leave the colonies (much of their property was confiscated by rebel governments) and as payment for military service. John Graves Simcoe, then lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, established the Township of Hope in the early 1790s, named after Colonel Henry Hope, lieutenant governor of the Province of Quebec.

From 1817 to 1819 the area was known as Toronto or &quot;Toronto at Smith&#x27;s Creek&quot;.

In 1819 the village and township were united and named Port Hope. In 1834 Port Hope was incorporated as a town.

Relatively slow growth from 1881 to 1951 resulted in much of the town&#x27;s 19th-century architecture surviving. Port Hope&#x27;s downtown is celebrated as Ontario&#x27;s best-preserved 19th-century streetscape. The town&#x27;s chapter of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario and the Heritage Port Hope Advisory Committee are very active and advise on the restoration and preservation of architecturally or historically significant buildings.

With over 270 heritage-designated buildings, Port Hope has a higher per capita rate of preservation than any other town or city in Canada. The municipality regulates downtown businesses to maintain the town&#x27;s unique character. This character makes Port Hope a destination for heritage tourism and people interested in architecture.

In 1978, eight members of the Satan&#x27;s Choice Motorcycle Club were charged with a murder that occurred at Port Hope&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Hotel. The trial and conviction of some members—the Port Hope 8 case—has been described as a miscarriage of justice. 

In 2001, the original town amalgamated with Hope Township to form the Municipality of &quot;Port Hope and Hope&quot;, which was renamed to its current name in November of that year. At the time of amalgamation, the census listed the town&#x27;s population as 11,718 and the township&#x27;s as 3,887.

The 2017 supernatural horror film &quot;It&quot;, its 2019 sequel &quot;It Chapter Two&quot;, and its prequel television series &quot;It – Welcome to Derry&quot; were all filmed in Port Hope, which portrayed the fictional Maine town of Derry.

===Radiation and cleanup===
Port Hope is known for having the largest volume of historic low-level radioactive wastes in Canada. The waste was created by Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited and its private sector predecessors, resulting from the refining of radium from pitchblende. Radium was used in radioluminescent paint (such as aircraft dials) and in early cancer treatments.

During World War II, the Eldorado plant produced exponentially more uranium oxides, which the United States used in the Manhattan Project to make nuclear weapons. This plant, now under the ownership of Cameco, continues to produce uranium fuel for nuclear power plants.

In 2002, a large amount of contaminated soil was removed from beachfront areas. More recently, testing of over 5,000 properties began, with a plan to remove and store contaminated soil that had been used as landfill. Over $1 billion is expected to be spent on the soil remediation project, the largest such cleanup in Canadian history.

==Geography==
===Communities===
Besides the town proper of Port Hope, the municipality of Port Hope comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including Campbellcroft, Canton, Dale, Davidson&#x27;s Corners (partially), Decker Hollow (ghost town), Elizabethville, Garden Hill, Knoxville, Morrish, Osaca, Perrytown, Port Britain, Rossmount (partially), Tinkerville, Thomstown, Welcome, Wesleyville, and Zion.

===Climate===
Port Hope has a humid continental climate (Dfb) with warm summers and cold winters.

==Economy==
Downtown Port Hope offers shopping and a historic main street. Port Hope is served by a Via Rail station. It has a medical center, and a community health centre. It has had a daily newspaper since 1878, the &quot;Port Hope Evening Guide&quot;. Until 2007, this was part of the Osprey Media chain and subsequently a part of the Sun Media organization. In 2009 the newspaper was amalgamated with the &quot;Cobourg Daily Star&quot; and renamed as &quot;Northumberland Today.com&quot;. In November 2017 the newspaper was included in the large-scale closing of many local community newspapers throughout the province of Ontario.

Port Hope&#x27;s Economic Development Strategic Plan aims to increase job growth at least as fast as population growth. The town has a variety of industries.

In January 2025, the Ontario Government announced plans for a new nuclear generating station to be built at Wesleyville. 

==Arts and culture==
The Ganaraska River (affectionately known as &quot;The Ganny&quot;), is well known to area anglers for annual salmon and trout runs. It has caused many historic floods, the most recent having occurred on March 21–22, 1980. Every April since until 2020, Port Hope has commemorated the flood with &quot;Float Your Fanny Down the Ganny&quot; ten kilometre boat race. &quot;Participants range from serious paddlers navigating the cold, fast-moving water in kayaks and canoes, to the very entertaining &#x27;crazy craft&#x27; paddlers, floating any combination of materials down the river in an attempt to reach the finish line.&quot; Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was cancelled in 2020 and 2021, the first time in its history for such action.

==Attractions==
The Capitol Theatre is Canada&#x27;s last functioning atmospheric theatre. The theatre&#x27;s main auditorium is styled after an outdoor medieval courtyard and rolling clouds are projected onto the ceiling. The town spent in excess of three million dollars renovating and upgrading the theatre in 2004–2005. It is also used for live events by Port Hope Festival Theatre.

<doc id="249001" wikidata="Q1152312" url="?curid=249001" title="Upside-down question and exclamation marks">
<text>The upside-down (also inverted, turned or rotated) question mark and exclamation mark are punctuation marks used to begin interrogative and exclamatory sentences or clauses in Spanish and some languages that have cultural ties with Spain, such as Asturian and Waray. The initial marks are mirrored at the end of the sentence or clause by the ordinary question mark, , or exclamation mark, .

Upside-down marks are supported by various standards, including ISO-8859-1, Unicode, and HTML. They can be entered directly on keyboards designed for Spanish-speaking countries.

==Usage==

The upside-down question mark is written before the first letter of an interrogative sentence or clause to indicate that a question follows. It is a rotated form of the standard symbol &quot;?&quot; recognized by speakers of other languages written with the Latin script. A regular question mark is written at the end of the sentence or clause.

Upside-down punctuation is especially critical in Spanish since the syntax of the language means that both statements and questions or exclamations could have the same wording. &quot;Do you like summer?&quot; and &quot;You like summer.&quot; are translated respectively as and (There is not always a difference between the wording of a yes–no question and the corresponding statement in Spanish.)

In sentences that are both declarative and interrogative, the clause that asks a question is isolated with the starting-symbol upside-down question mark, for example: (&quot;If you cannot go with them, would you like to go with us?&quot;), not * This helps to recognize questions and exclamations in long sentences.

Unlike the ending marks, which are printed along the baseline of the text, the upside-down marks (¿ and ¡) descend below the line.

== History ==

Upside-down marks, simple in the era of hand typesetting, were originally recommended by the (Royal Spanish Academy), in the second edition of the (Orthography of the Castilian language) in 1754 recommending it as the symbol indicating the beginning of a question in written Spanish—e.g. (&quot;How old are you?&quot;; ). The Real Academia also ordered the same upside-down-symbol system for statements of exclamation, using the symbols &quot;¡&quot; and &quot;!&quot;.

These new rules were slow to be adopted: there are 19th-century books in which the printer uses neither &quot;¡&quot; nor &quot;¿&quot;.

Outside of the Spanish-speaking world, John Wilkins proposed using the upside-down exclamation mark &quot;¡&quot; as a symbol at the end of a sentence to denote irony in 1668. He was one of many, including Desiderius Erasmus, who felt there was a need for such a punctuation mark, but Wilkins&#x27; proposal, like the other attempts, failed to take hold.

== Adoption ==
Some writers omit the upside-down question mark in the case of a short unambiguous question such as: (&quot;Who comes?&quot;). This is the criterion in Galician and formerly in Catalan. Certain Catalan-language authorities, such as Joan Solà i Cortassa, insist that both the opening and closing question marks be used for clarity. The current Institute for Catalan Studies prescription is never to use the upside-down marks for Catalan.

Some Spanish-language writers, among them Nobel laureate Pablo Neruda (1904–1973), refuse to use the upside-down question mark.

== Mixtures == 
It is acceptable in Spanish to begin a sentence with an opening upside-down exclamation mark (&quot;¡&quot;) and end it with a question mark (&quot;?&quot;), or vice versa, for statements that are questions but also have a clear sense of exclamation or surprise such as: (&quot;And who do you think you are?!&quot;). Normally, four signs are used, always with one type in the outer side and the other in the inner side (nested) (&#x27;, &#x27;)

Unicode 5.1 also includes , which is an upside-down version of the interrobang, a nonstandard punctuation mark used to denote both excitement and a question in one glyph. It is also known as a &quot;gnaborretni&quot; () (interrobang spelled backwards).

==Computer usage==
===Encodings===
 and are in the &quot;Latin-1 Supplement&quot; Unicode block, which is inherited from ISO-8859-1:
* 

===Typing the character===
 and are available in all keyboard layouts designed for Spanish-speaking countries. Smart phones typically offer these if you hold down or in the on-screen keyboard. Auto-correct will often turn a normal mark typed at the start of a sentence to the upside-down one.

On systems with an AltGr key (actual or emulated via right Alt key) and Extended (or &#x27;International&#x27;) keyboard mapping set, the symbols can be accessed directly, though the sequence varies by OS and locality and is documented by the vendor. Otherwise see Unicode input.

<doc id="249003" wikidata="Q243808" url="?curid=249003" title="Phatthalung province">
<text>Phatthalung (, ) is one of the southern provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand. Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) Nakhon Si Thammarat, Songkhla, Satun, and Trang. Phatthalung is essentially a landlocked province, one of the only two in southern Thailand, the other being Yala.

==Geography==

The province is on the Malay Peninsula. It borders to the east the large and shallow Songkhla Lake, and to the west the Nakhon Si Thammarat mountain range. Khao Pu–Khao Ya National Park is at the border with Trang. Forests cover , or 16.3 percent of the province&#x27;s area.

==History==
Phatthalung was formerly known as Mardelong (Jawi: مردلوڠ) in Malay, especially during the time when the region came under Malay-Muslim influence.

Phatthalung became one of twelve royal cities during the reign of King Ramathibodi I of the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 14th century. At the end of the 18th century, King Rama I submitted the city to the Ministry of Defense, which was responsible for all the southern provinces. In 1896, during the administrative reforms of King Chulalongkorn, Phatthalung became part of the Monthon Nakhon Si Thammarat. In 1924, King Rama VI ordered to move the city of Phatthalung to the present-day Khuha Sawan Subdistrict.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows the 177 meter high Phu Khao Ok Thalu mountain, the symbol of the province. The provincial tree and flower is the sweet shorea (&quot;Shorea roxburghii&quot;). The provincial aquatic life is the tinfoil barb (&quot;Barbonymus schwanenfeld&quot;), also known locally as &quot;pla lam-pam&quot; (Thai: ปลาลำปำ), the eponymous of the striking local water source Songkhla Lake, or known in Phatthalung as Lam Pam Lake or Thale Noi and Phatthalung Lake.

==Transport==
===Air===
Phatthalung does not have an airport. The nearest airport is Trang Airport, which is 66 km from the center of Phatthalung.

===Rail===
The main station in the province is the Phatthalung Railway Station.
==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===
Phatthalung is divided into 11 districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). The districts are further divided into 65 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 626 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Phatthalung Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 49 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Phatthalung has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 48 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 24 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Demographics==


The majority of the province&#x27;s populace are Thai Buddhists. Muslims account for 11.1 percent of the population. Many of Phatthalung&#x27;s Muslims have some ethnic Malay ancestry, but over the centuries they had intermarried with the Thais and adopted Thai cultural norms.

==Tourism==

===Sights===

Phraya Thukkharat (Chuai) Monument (อนุสาวรีย์พระยาทุกขราษฎร์ (ช่วย)) - Phraya Thukkharat was a former monk known as Phra Maha Chuai. During the Nine Armies War in the reign of King Rama I, then Phra Maha Chuai had assisted Phraya Phatthalung, who had led a force of villagers to defeat an invading Burmese army. Later, when he had left the monkhood, he was awarded the royal title Phraya Thukkharat and was an assistant to the city&#x27;s ruler.

== Culture ==
*Manora or Nora (มโนราห์หรือโนรา) A local performing art in the south. It was an influence from the south of India, together with Lakhon Chatri (theatrical show by males). However, some dancing patterns were changed to match folk cultures in each province. There are 12 major dancing patterns. The patterns are done to lyrics sung by the dancers, either impromptu or composed in advance.

*Talung (ตะลุง) (shadow plays) is a popular folk performance of the south. Talung puppets are made of dried cattle hide, cut beautifully into the characters of each shadow play. The puppets are usually painted black and each of them is held firmly between split bamboo slats called &quot;mai tap&quot;. A puppet&#x27;s mouth and hands will move in accordance with the narration. A Talung ensemble comprises the puppet masters (who are also the vocalists) and a band, totalling no more than eight persons. The musical instruments include pipes, drums, phon (a special kind of drum), and a gong.

*Khaeng Phon Lak Phra (แข่งโพนลากพระ) A type of Chak Phra or Lak Phra, a religious tradition in the south, but in Phatthalung it has different characteristics from other provinces. This festival is held on the full moon of the 11th month according to the Thai lunar calendar. The festival celebrates the ending of the Buddhist lent (Wan Ok Phansa). According to local tradition, the believers carry the Buddha statues from the temples to the river and back. Several parades are held. In every parade drummers that represent one of the shrines in the city participate. In addition to the colored parades, various culture events take place like; drumming contests between the temples, dance shows, Buddha parades contests, water sports contests on Songkhla Lake, various exhibitions, etc. The type of drum used is called &quot;Taphon&quot; or simply &quot;Phon&quot;. Hence the name of the festival.

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

== Economy ==
Phatthalung is the home of real-world Implementation of LoRaWAN Internet of things this consist of devices with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the LoRaWAN or other communication networks and provided to people for free. This system called &quot;The People&#x27;s Network&quot; by installed LoRaWAN Gateway running by start-up company named Southern IoT.

<text>À, à (a-grave) is a letter of the Catalan, Emilian-Romagnol, French, Italian, Maltese, Occitan, Portuguese, Sardinian, Scottish Gaelic, Vietnamese, and Welsh languages consisting of the letter A of the ISO basic Latin alphabet and a grave accent. À is also used in Pinyin transliteration. In most languages, it represents the vowel &quot;a&quot;. This letter is also a letter in Taos to indicate a mid tone.

In accounting or invoices, &quot;à&quot; abbreviates &quot;at a rate of&quot;: &quot;5 apples à $1&quot; (one dollar each). That usage is based upon the French preposition &quot;à&quot; and has evolved into the at sign (@). Sometimes, it is part of a surname: Thomas à Kempis, Mary Anne à Beckett.

== Usage in various languages ==

=== Emilian-Romagnol ===
À is used in Emilian to represent short stressed [a], e.g. Bolognese dialect &quot;sacàtt&quot; [saˈkatː] &quot;sack&quot;.

=== French ===
The grave accent is used in the French language to differentiate homophones, e.g. and .

=== Portuguese ===

À is used in Portuguese to represent a contraction of the feminine singular definite article &quot;a&quot; with the preposition &quot;a&quot; or the demonstrative &quot;aquele&quot; and its inflections and derivations (&quot;aquela, aquilo, aqueles, aquelas, aqueloutro(a)&quot;, etc):
: &quot;Ele foi à praia&quot;.
: He went to the beach.
: &quot;É igual àquela camisa que eu tinha&quot;.
: It&#x27;s identical to that shirt I had.

&quot;À&quot; is always unstressed, as opposed to &quot;Á&quot; and &quot;Â&quot;, which are always stressed.

=== Scottish Gaelic ===
In early orthographic descriptions of Scottish Gaelic from the 18th and 19th centuries, à is the only way to represent a long [a]; later forms of Scottish Gaelic also used the acute accent [á] to indicate a longer [a] sound.

== Character mappings ==

<text>Á, á (a-acute) is a letter of the Chinese (Pinyin), Blackfoot, Czech, Dobrujan Tatar, Dutch, Faroese, Filipino, Galician, Hungarian, Icelandic, Irish, Karakalpak, Lakota, Navajo, Occitan, Portuguese, Sámi, Slovak, Spanish, Vietnamese, Welsh and Western Apache languages as a variant of the letter a. It is sometimes confused with à; e.g. &quot;5 pommes á €1&quot;, which is supposed to be written as &quot;5 pommes [[à]] €1&quot; (meaning &quot;5 apples at 1 euro each&quot; in French).

== Usage in various languages ==
=== Chinese ===
In Chinese pinyin á is the &quot;yángpíng&quot; tone (陽平/阳平 &quot;high-rising tone&quot;) of &quot;a&quot;.

=== Czech ===
Á is the 2nd letter of the Czech language and represents the sound .

===Dobrujan Tatar===
Á is the 2nd letter of the Dobrujan Tatar alphabet, represents the near-low unrounded ATR or soft vowel /æ/ as in &quot;sáát&quot; [s̶ææt̶] &#x27;hour&#x27;, &#x27;clock&#x27;.

===Dutch===
In Dutch, the Á is used to put emphasis on an &quot;a&quot;, either in a long &quot;a&quot; form like in &quot;háár&quot; (&quot;hair&quot;), or in a short form like in &quot;kán&quot; (the verb &quot;can&quot;).

=== Faroese ===
Á is the 2nd letter of the Faroese alphabet and represents or .

=== Filipino ===
In Filipino, á is an accented letter and has no direct equivalent other than a. An example is the first &quot;a&quot; as in &quot;baka&quot; (&quot;cow&quot;) and &quot;tatawid&quot; (&quot;to cross&quot;).

=== Hungarian ===
In Hungarian, Á is the second letter of Hungarian representing .

=== Icelandic ===
Á is the second letter of the Icelandic alphabet and represents (as in &quot;ow&quot;).

=== Irish ===
In Irish, á is called &quot;a fada&quot; (&quot;long a&quot;), pronounced and appears in words such as &quot;slán&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;). It is the only diacritic used in Modern Irish, since the decline of the dot above many letters in the Irish language. Fada is only used on vowel letters i.e. á, é, í, ó, ú. It symbolises a lengthening of the vowel.

=== Karakalpak ===
Á is defined as the second letter and represents .

=== Kazakh ===

In the 2018 amends of Kazakh alphabet list, Á is defined as the second letter and represents . It has been replaced by Ä ä in the 2019 amends, and matches Cyrillic alphabet Ә, 2017 version Aʼ and Arabic ٵ.

=== Portuguese ===
In Portuguese, á is used to mark a stressed in words whose stressed syllable is in an abnormal location within the word, as in &quot;lá&quot; (there) and &quot;rápido&quot; (rapid, fast). If the location of the stressed syllable is predictable, the acute accent is not used. Á contrasts with â, pronounced .

===Scottish Gaelic===
Á was once used in Scottish Gaelic, but has now been largely superseded by à. It can still be seen in certain writings, but it is no longer used in standard orthography.

=== Slovak ===
Á is the 2nd letter in the Slovak alphabet and it represents .

=== Spanish ===
In Spanish, á is an accented letter. There is no alphabetical or phonological difference between a and á; both sound like /a/, both are considered the same letter, and both have the same value in the Spanish alphabetical order. The accent indicates the stressed syllable in words with irregular stress patterns. It can also be used to &quot;break up&quot; a diphthong or to avoid what would otherwise be homonyms, although this does not happen with á, because a is a strong vowel and usually does not become a semivowel in a diphthong. See Diacritic and Acute accent for more details.

=== Vietnamese ===
In the Vietnamese alphabet, á is the &quot;sắc&quot; tone (high-rising tone) of a. &quot;Á&quot;, as a shorthand for &quot;châu Á&quot;, is also the Vietnamese word for &quot;Asia&quot;.

=== Welsh ===
In Welsh, word stress usually falls on the penultimate syllable, but one way of indicating stress on a final (short) vowel is through the use of the acute accent. The acute accent on &quot;a&quot; is often found in verbal nouns and borrowed words, for example, &quot;casáu&quot; &quot;to hate&quot;, &quot;caniatáu&quot; &quot;to allow&quot;, &quot;carafán&quot; &quot;caravan&quot;.

<text>Â, â (a-circumflex) is a letter of the Inari Sami, Skolt Sami, Romanian, Vietnamese and Mizo alphabets. This letter also appears in French, Friulian, Frisian, Portuguese, Turkish, Walloon, and Welsh languages as a variant of the letter &quot;a&quot;. It is included in some romanization systems for Khmer, Persian, Balinese, Sasak, Russian, and Ukrainian.

== Berber languages ==
&quot;â&quot; can be used in Berber Latin alphabet to represent .

== Emilian-Romagnol ==
Â is used to represent [aː] in Emilian dialects, as in Bolognese &quot;câna&quot; [kaːna] &quot;cane&quot;.

== Faroese ==
, who translated the Gospel of Matthew into Faroese in 1823, used â to denote a non-syllabic a, as in the following example:

Â is not used in modern Faroese, however.

== French ==
, in the French language, is used as the letter with a circumflex accent. It is a remnant of Old French, where the vowel was followed, with some exceptions, by the consonant . For example, the modern form &quot;bâton&quot; () comes from the Old French &quot;baston&quot;. Phonetically, is traditionally pronounced as , but is nowadays rarely distinguished from in many dialects such as in Parisian French. However, the traditional is still pronounced this way in Québecois French or Canadian French, which is known to resemble the phonetics of the Old French accent, and is widely spoken by French Canadians, the majority of whom live in the province of Québec.

In Maghreb French, is used to transcribe the Arabic consonant , whose pronunciation is close to a non-syllabic .

== Friulian ==
Â is used to represent the sound.

==Inari Sami==
Â is used to represent the sound.

== Italian ==
Â is occasionally used to represent the sound in words like &quot;amâr&quot;, a poetic contraction of &quot;amarono&quot; (they loved).

== Khmer ==
Â is used in the UNGEGN romanization system to represent the sound in Khmer.

== Persian ==
Â is used in the romanization of Persian to represent the sound in words such as Fârs.

== Portuguese ==
In Portuguese, â is used to mark a stressed in words whose stressed syllable is nasal and in an unpredictable location within the word, as in &quot;lâmina&quot; (blade) and &quot;âmbar&quot; (amber). Where the location of the stressed syllable is predictable, such as in &quot;ando&quot; (I walk), the circumflex accent is not used. Â contrasts with á, pronounced .

== Romanian ==
Â is the 3rd letter of the Romanian alphabet and represents , which is also represented in Romanian as letter î. The difference between the two is that â is used in the middle of the word, as in &quot;România&quot;, while î is used at the beginning and at the ends: &quot;înțelegere&quot; (understanding), &quot;a urî&quot; (to hate). A compound word starting with the letter î will retain it, even if it goes in the middle of the word: compare &quot;înțelegere&quot; (understanding) with &quot;neînțelegere&quot; (misunderstanding). However, if a suffix is added, the î changes into â, as in the example: &quot;a urî&quot; (to hate), &quot;urât&quot; (hated). Another grapheme &lt;a&gt; in Romanian with diacritic is &lt;ă&gt;.

== Russian ==
Â is used in the ISO 9:1995 system of Russian transliteration as the letter Я.

== Serbo-Croatian ==
In all standard varieties of Serbo-Croatian, &quot;â&quot; is not a letter but simply an &quot;a&quot; with the circumflex that denotes vowel length. It is used only occasionally and then disambiguates homographs, which differ only by syllable length. That is most common in the plural genitive case and so it is also called &quot;genitive sign&quot;: &quot;Ja sam sâm&quot; ().

== Sicilian ==
Â is used to represent [aː] in Sicilian, as in the preposition &quot;&quot; [paː] &quot;for the&quot;.

== Tagalog ==
In Filipino languages, &quot;â&quot; used to be prounounced as a glottal stop. It somehow pronounces as &quot;isdâ (fish)&quot;. Some of these words should end with &quot;â&quot;.

== Turkish ==
Â is used to indicate the consonant before &quot;a&quot; is palatalized, as in &quot;kâr&quot; (&quot;profit&quot;). It is also used to indicate in words for which the long vowel changes the meaning, as in &quot;adet&quot; (&quot;pieces&quot;) and &quot;âdet&quot; (&quot;tradition&quot;) / &quot;hala&quot; (&quot;aunt&quot;) and &quot;hâlâ&quot; (&quot;still&quot;).

In religious contexts, â (like î and û) is sometimes used to correspond to Arabic long vowels (Alâeddîn, Sâd Sûresî, etc.)

== Ukrainian ==
Â is used in the ISO 9:1995 system of Ukrainian transliteration to represent the letter Я.

== Vietnamese ==
Â is the 3rd letter of the Vietnamese alphabet and represents . &quot;â&quot; is a higher vowel than plain &quot;a&quot; . In Vietnamese phonology, diacritics can be added to form five forms to represent five tones of â:
* Ầ ầ
* Ẩ ẩ
* Ẫ ẫ
* Ấ ấ

== Welsh ==
In Welsh, &quot;â&quot; is used to represent long stressed &quot;a&quot; when, without the circumflex, the vowel would be pronounced as short , e.g., &quot;âr&quot; &quot;arable&quot;, as opposed to &quot;ar&quot; &quot;on&quot;; or &quot;gwâr&quot; &quot;civilised, humane&quot;, rather than &quot;gwar&quot; &quot;nape of the neck&quot;. It is often found in final syllables where two adjacent &quot;a&quot; letters combine to produce a long stressed vowel. This commonly happens when a verb stem ending in stressed &quot;a&quot; combines with the nominalising suffix &quot;-ad&quot;, as in + &quot;-ad&quot; giving &quot;permission&quot;, and also when a singular noun ending in &quot;a&quot; receives the plural suffix &quot;-au&quot;, as in &quot;drama&quot; + &quot;-au&quot; becoming &quot;dramâu&quot; &quot;dramas, plays&quot;. It is also useful in writing borrowed words with final stress, e.g. &quot;brigade&quot;.

A circumflex is also used in the word &quot;â&quot;, which is both a preposition, meaning &quot;with, by means of, as&quot;, and the third person non-past singular of the verbal noun &quot;mynd&quot;, &quot;go&quot;. This distinguishes it in writing from the similarly pronounced &quot;a&quot;, meaning &quot;and; whether; who, which, that&quot;.

Â and â are obtained by the commands \^A and \^a.

== In encoding mismatches ==
In a common example of mojibake, the capital &quot;Â&quot; is sometimes seen on webpages when the page has been encoded in UTF-8 and decoded using ISO 8859-1 or Windows-1252, two encodings which are commonly referred to as &quot;Western&quot; or &quot;Western European&quot;. In UTF-8, the copyright symbol (©) is encoded with the hexadecimal bytes codice_1. In the older Western encoding standards, however, the © symbol is simply codice_2. If a browser is given the bytes codice_1, intended to display © in UTF-8, but is led to parse the bytes according to one of the Western encodings, it will interpret the bytes codice_1 as two separate characters. codice_5 corresponds to Â, as seen in the chart above, and codice_2 devolves to the © symbol, so the result seen by the person reading the page is codice_7—that is, the correct © symbol but with an Â prepended. Characters with Unicode code points from codice_8 to codice_9 have UTF-8 encodings that are identical to their Western encodings but preceded by the byte codice_5, so that when any of these characters is encoded in UTF-8 and viewed in a Western encoding, an Â will appear before it.

<text>A with tilde (majuscule: Ã, minuscule: ã) is a letter of the Latin alphabet formed by addition of the tilde diacritic over the letter A. It is used in Portuguese, Guaraní, Kashubian, Taa, Aromanian, and Vietnamese. In the past, it was also used in Greenlandic.

== Usage ==
In Portuguese, it represents a nasal near-open central vowel ([ɐ̃]), though it varies from near-open to mid-central vowel according to dialect. It also appears as a part of the diphthongs &quot;ãe&quot;, pronounced as /ɐ̃j̃/, and &quot;ão&quot;, pronounced as /ɐ̃w̃/.

In Kashubian, the letter is generally pronounced as nasalized open front unrounded vowel ([ã]). In the dialect present in counties of Puck and Wejherowo, it is pronounced as nasalized open-mid front unrounded vowel ([ɛ̃]). Its the 3rd letter of the Kashubian alphabet.

In Guaraní and Taa, it is pronounced as nasalized open front unrounded vowel ([ã]).

In Aromanian, it is pronounced as mid-central vowel ([ə]) or close central unrounded vowel ([ɨ]).

In Vietnamese, it is pronounced as long open front unrounded vowel ([aː]) in a high breaking-rising tone.

It is also used as a phonetic symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet, where its lower case (ã), represents the nasalized open front unrounded vowel.

Formerly, the letter was also used in the Greenlandic to represent long open front unrounded vowel ([aː]) next to a geminated consonant, but now it is replaced with Aa.

The letter is also used in Belter Creole, a constructed language made by Nick Farmer for &quot;The Expanse&quot; television sci-fi series. In the language, it represents the nasalized near-open front unrounded vowel ([æ̃]) sound, for example in the word &quot;shãsa&quot;, which means &quot;chance&quot;.

<text>È, è (e-grave) is a letter of the Latin alphabet. In English, &quot;è&quot; is formed with an addition of a grave accent onto the letter E and is sometimes used in the past tense or past participle forms of verbs in poetic texts to indicate that the final syllable should be pronounced separately.

* &quot;È&quot; (&quot;è&quot;) is also used in Macedonian Latin as an equivalent of the letter ye with grave (&quot;Ѐ&quot;, &quot;ѐ&quot;).
* In Romagnol, it represents [ɛ], e.g. &quot;vècc&quot;&#x27; [vɛtʃː] &quot;old men&quot;.
* &quot;È&quot; (&quot;è&quot;) is used to mark the long vowel sounds and in Scottish Gaelic.
* &quot;È&quot; (&quot;è&quot;) is used in Vietnamese to represent the letter &quot;E&quot; with the dấu huyền tone. It can also combine with &quot;Ê&quot; to form &quot;Ề&quot;.

<text>É or é (e-acute) is a letter of the Latin alphabet. In English, it is used for loanwords (such as French &quot;résumé&quot;), romanization (Japanese &quot;Pokémon&quot;) (Balinese &quot;Dénpasar&quot;, &quot;Buléléng&quot;) or occasionally as a pronunciation aid in poetry, to indicate stress on an unusual syllable.

Languages may use &quot;é&quot; to indicate a certain sound (French), stress pattern (Spanish), length (Czech) or tone (Vietnamese), as well as to write loanwords or distinguish identical-sounding words (Dutch). Certain romanization systems such as pinyin (Standard Chinese) also use &quot;é&quot; for tone. Some languages use the letter only in specific contexts, such as in Indonesian dictionaries.

==Languages==

===Afrikaans===
In Afrikaans, é is used to differentiate meaning and word types. For example: in a sentence that repeats a word (that contains the vowel e) with different meaning or specificity, the e in one of the occurrences could be replaced with é to indicate the different meaning or specificity. Furthermore, é is respected when writing foreign words, mainly from French; and it is used to add visual stress on words in the same way English might use italics.

===Balinese===
É in Balinese is the only diacritic found form and is used to represent [/eː/] for example:&lt;br&gt;animal:&lt;br&gt;&quot;léléipi&quot; (&quot;snake&quot;)&lt;br&gt;&quot;kédis&quot; (&quot;bird&quot;)&lt;br&gt;verb:&lt;br&gt;&quot;subé&quot; (&quot;done&quot;)&lt;br&gt;&quot;méméaca (reading)&lt;br&gt;number counting:&lt;br&gt;&quot;télu&quot; (&quot;three&quot;)&lt;br&gt;eném (six).

===Catalan===
In Catalan, é is used to represent [e], e.g. &quot;séc&quot; [sek] &quot;fold&quot;. Similar to French and Italian, there is a contrast between é and è, the latter of which represents [ɛ] (e.g. &quot;què&quot; [kɛ] &quot;what&quot;). 

===Czech and Slovak===

See Acute accent for a more detailed description. In addition, Danish uses é in some loanwords to represent /i/.

===Dutch===
Like in English, é is respected when writing foreign words, mainly from French. It is also used to differentiate the article &quot;een&quot;, equivalent to either &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot; in English, and &quot;één&quot;, the number one. It is also used to add visual stress on words in the same way English might use italics. In Dutch, some people use &quot;hé&quot; as a greeting, like &quot;hey&quot; or &quot;hi&quot;.

===Emilian===
In Emilian, é is used to represent [e], e.g. &quot;récc&quot; [rekː] &quot;rich&quot;.

===English===

In English, the e-acute (é) has some uses, mostly in words borrowed from French, such as née, résumé, fiancée, sauté, and coupé; and names such as Beyoncé, Breneé, JonBenét, and Théo. Often the purpose of the accent is to remind the reader that a final &quot;e&quot; is not silent. Pokémon, the media franchise owned by Japanese video game company and corporation Nintendo, uses [k]é to signify the proper pronunciation of the katakana ケ.

===French===

===Indonesian===
É is used in Indonesian dictionaries to denote , in contrast with &quot;E, e&quot; (). For example, &quot;serang&quot; (without the acute) means &quot;to attack,&quot; whereas &quot;Sérang&quot; (with the acute) is the provincial capital of Banten.

It is, however, retained in editions of poetry where the rhyme suggests pronouncing it as &quot;i&quot; or &quot;y&quot;.

===Portuguese===
In Portuguese, é is used to mark a stressed in words whose stressed syllable is in unpredictable within the word, as in (very bad). If the location of the stressed syllable is predictable, the acute accent is not used. É contrasts with ê .

===Welsh===
In Welsh, word stress usually falls on the penultimate syllable, but one way of indicating stress on a final (short) vowel is through the use of the acute accent, often found on &quot;e&quot; in borrowed words: &quot;personél&quot; &quot;personnel&quot;, &quot;sigarét&quot; &quot;cigarette&quot;, &quot;ymbarél&quot; &quot;umbrella&quot;.

===Yoruba===
e with a Mí High with a rising tone, depicted by an acute accent. 
The pronunciation of words in Yorùbá language is tonal; where a different pitch conveys a different word meaning or grammatical distinction.

This means that pronouncing words in Yorùbá is based on what is called Àmì ohùn – Tone Marks. These marks are applied to the top of the vowel within each syllable of a word or phrase.

There are three types of tone marks namely:

Dò Low with a falling tone, depicted by a grave accent
Re Mid with a flat tone, depicted by an absence of any accent 
Mí High with a rising tone, depicted by an acute accent 
Understanding the use of tone marks is key to properly reading, writing and speaking the Yorùbá language. This is because some words have similar spellings but at the addition of tone marks, these words could have very different meanings.
