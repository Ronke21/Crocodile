<doc id="242710" wikidata="Q221173" url="?curid=242710" title="Outline of academic disciplines">
<text>An academic discipline or field of study is a branch of knowledge, taught and researched as part of higher education. A scholar&#x27;s discipline is commonly defined by the university faculties and learned societies to which they belong and the academic journals in which they publish research.

Disciplines vary between well-established ones in almost all universities with well-defined rosters of journals and conferences and nascent ones supported by only a few universities and publications. A discipline may have branches, which are often called sub-disciplines.

The following outline provides an overview of and topical guide to academic disciplines. In each case, an entry at the highest level of the hierarchy (e.g., Humanities) is a group of broadly similar disciplines; an entry at the next highest level (e.g., Music) is a discipline having some degree of autonomy and being the fundamental identity felt by its scholars. Lower levels of the hierarchy are sub-disciplines that do generally not have any role in the structure of the university&#x27;s governance.

<text>The swallow-tailed bee-eater (Merops hirundineus) is a near passerine bird in the bee-eater family, Meropidae.

==Description==
This species, like other bee-eaters, is a richly coloured, slender bird. Its colours and readily visible forked tail make it unmistakable. It is mainly green with a yellow throat, blue gorget and black eye stripe and beak. It can reach a length of 20–22 cm, including the long forked green or blue feathers. Sexes are alike.

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds in savannah woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. It is partially migratory, moving in response to rainfall patterns. This is a species which prefers somewhat more wooded country than most bee-eaters.

==Behaviour==
This attractive bird is readily approached. Just as the name suggests, bee-eaters predominantly eat insects, especially bees, wasps and hornets, which are caught in the air by sorties from an open perch. The swallowtail has a preference for honeybees.

These bee-eaters nest as pairs or in very small colonies in sandy banks, or similar flat ground. They make a relatively long tunnel in which the 2 to 4 spherical, white eggs are laid. They also feed and roost communally.

<doc id="242714" wikidata="Q1285835" url="?curid=242714" title="Edmonton Elks">
<text>The Edmonton Elks are a professional Canadian football team based in Edmonton, Alberta. The club competes in the Canadian Football League (CFL) as a member of the league&#x27;s West Division and plays their home games at Commonwealth Stadium. The Elks were founded in 1949 as the Edmonton Eskimos and have won the Grey Cup championship fourteen times (including a three-peat between 1954 and 1956 and an unmatched five consecutive wins between 1978 and 1982), most recently in 2015 and the most of any CFL club based in Western Canada. The team has a rivalry with the Calgary Stampeders. The team discontinued using the &quot;Eskimos&quot; name in 2020, with the new name &quot;Elks&quot; formally announced on June 1, 2021.

== Ownership ==
The Edmonton Elks were a &quot;community owned&quot; team (owned by local shareholders) since their inception in 1949 to midway through the 2024 season.

Edmonton Elks Football Team, Inc., was governed by a ten-member board of directors. The board consisted of a chairman, treasurer, secretary, and seven directors. The club&#x27;s president and CEO was Chris Presson until he was fired on November 22, 2021.

As of 2024, Larry Thompson, longtime Elks fan and shareholder, bought the team outright, becoming the first private owner in club history.

== History ==
===Football in Edmonton 1895–1939===
The Edmonton Rugby Foot-ball Club, unaffiliated with the current team, was an early Canadian football-rugby union team based in Edmonton. The team played its first organized games with the formation of the Alberta Rugby Football League in 1895. In 1908 the name Esquimaux was adopted. In 1910 the club was officially named the Edmonton Eskimos and was briefly called the Edmonton Elks during 1922. (The city was represented by the Edmonton Civics in 1914 and the Edmonton Canucks in 1919.) After appearing in and losing the 9th Grey Cup and 10th Grey Cup games (being the first western teams to play for the Cup) the team folded in 1925, but returned for two seasons beginning 1928, and then folded again. It was succeeded by the Edmonton Boosters, who played for three more seasons, and the Edmonton Hi-Grads in 1936 (a team of high school graduate all stars.) Elite-level football returned to Edmonton in 1938 with a team once again called the Eskimos, this time in the Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU). This team ceased operating after only two seasons because of the Second World War.

===Team history===

The current incarnation of the team began in the 1949 WIFU season as the Edmonton Eskimos under head coach Annis Stukus, for whom the CFL&#x27;s annual coach of the year award is named. The team played home games at Clarke Stadium and quickly saw success under quarterback Jackie Parker and running back Johnny Bright, winning the Grey Cup three years in a row from 1954 to 1956. The team did not win the Grey Cup again until 1975, the longest drought in team history. The team moved to Commonwealth Stadium in 1978.

The team won five consecutive Grey Cups (1978–82), led by superstar quarterbacks Warren Moon and Tom Wilkinson and head coach Hugh Campbell. After a brief absence, Campbell returned to the team in 1986 and worked for Edmonton in an administrative capacity until his retirement in 2006. This five-year dynasty, followed by the dominance of the city&#x27;s NHL team the Edmonton Oilers, led the city to be nicknamed the &quot;City of Champions&quot; in the 1980s. Edmonton made it to nine Grey Cups in a ten-year span from 1973 to 1982.

In the 1980s and 90s the team&#x27;s marquee player was Gizmo Williams who still holds many CFL records in punt and kickoff returns and was a key part in Grey Cup victories in 1987 and 1993 under head coach Ron Lancaster. During this period the team was also known for its stellar defensive line, with future Canadian Football Hall of Famers like Danny Kepley and Danny Bass winning Defensive Player of the Year Awards and Willie Pless winning the trophy a record five times.

After winning the Grey Cup in both 2003 and 2005, under quarterback Ricky Ray, who is Edmonton&#x27;s all-time leader in passing yards, the team missed the playoffs the following year, for the first time in 34 years, a North American professional sport record. This led to a ten-year Grey Cup drought. After a gap of ten years, Edmonton won the Grey Cup again in 2015, under the leadership of quarterback Mike Reilly, their most recent championship.

In 2020 pressure mounted from team sponsors such as Belairdirect, Boston Pizza, and Sports Interaction, a First Nations–owned betting company, for the team to change their name. The term &quot;Eskimo&quot; is an offensive term historically placed on Inuit people. The team officially dropped all use of the word &quot;Eskimo&quot; from the team on July 21, 2020. In response, the team temporarily rebranded as the &quot;Edmonton Football Team&quot; or, secondarily, the &quot;EE Football Team&quot;, confirming their plan was to rebrand with a nickname starting with &quot;E&quot; to continue the use of at least some of their branding, most notably the interlocked double-E logo. This move was supported by multiple Indigenous groups, including the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, a group representing over 60,000 Inuit across Canada. On June 1, 2021, the team formally announced that the new Edmonton team name would be the Edmonton Elks, a name used by the Edmonton football club of 1922.Franchise great Warren Moon, who led Edmonton to a record five straight Grey Cups between 1978 and 1982 stated, &quot;The name Eskimos, to me, just means pride and it means winning with that organization&quot;. However, he stated that he was ultimately supportive of the move because some people might be offended by the name. Saying, &quot;If this is something that is insensitive to another group of people, that is something I can understand being a minority myself.&quot; This came around the same time as the Washington Redskins of the National Football League rebranded as the Washington Commanders, and the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball rebranded as the Cleveland Guardians.
====Team colours and branding====
The team colours, green and gold, have remained essentially the same over the years with only minor modifications to the uniform or logo until 2021, when the EE logo was designated as a secondary logo, and introduced a new logo of a stylized image of an elk and the Elks helmet logo was changed to antlers. After keeping the elk-antler helmet for the 2021 season, the team reintroduced the EE logo to their helmets (albeit with it not being enclosed in an oval) in the 2022 offseason, acknowledging fan favourability towards the logo.
In 2021, the Elks worked with artist Izaiah Masuskapoe, an Indigenous student at West Edmonton’s St. Thomas More Catholic Junior High School, to create a special logo to celebrate the Indigenous people in Edmonton, which later spread to all of Canada in 2024 as the CFL commemorated the National Day of Truth and Reconciliation with logos of their own. This followed a similar effort by the BC Lions months before.

Following new private ownership, the EE logo returned as the primary logo in 2025 and the Elk logo was retained as the secondary logo.

===Team records and achievements===
With 14 Grey Cup wins, the franchise has won the Grey Cup more than any other team except the Toronto Argonauts, who have 18 wins. This includes more championships than any other team since the CFL was formed in the 1950s. Edmonton holds the record for most consecutive Grey Cup appearances (6 from 1977–1982), and consecutive wins (5 from 1978–1982). The team is the only one to have won three or more consecutive Grey Cups twice (1954–1956 and 1978–1982).

The team has the distinction of setting two opposite North American professional sports records: from a success standpoint, Edmonton made the playoffs for 34 consecutive years from 1972 to 2005. At the other end, the Elks hold the dubious record of most consecutive home losses, set when they passed 21 on July 29, 2023. This streak ended at 22, with the first home win under the Elks name coming August 27, 2023. This record was previously held by the 1953 St. Louis Browns.

The Elks have also led the CFL in yearly attendance many times. As of August 2016, Edmonton had the highest average attendance in the league 27 times since moving to Commonwealth Stadium in 1978.

Team alumni have figured prominently in Alberta political life: past players include two former provincial premiers (Peter Lougheed and Donald Getty), a former mayor of Edmonton (Bill Smith), and a lieutenant-governor (Norman Kwong). Athletes of significance in other professional sports that played for the Elks include professional wrestler and WWE champion Roman Reigns, who played under his birthname Joe Anoa&#x27;i in 2008.

== Wall of Honour ==
The Edmonton Elks have a policy of honouring the players who have best represented the team on the field. The player&#x27;s name, number and seasons played with the Edmonton Elks are displayed on the edge of the concrete separating the field level from the lower bowl of Commonwealth Stadium. The Elks keep most of the numbers in circulation rather than retire them from use. However, the team has had the numbers of Warren Moon (1), Don Warrington (21), and Rollie Miles (98) removed from circulation and are no longer issued.

<doc id="242728" wikidata="Q1264629" url="?curid=242728" title="Duke of Westminster">
<text>Duke of Westminster is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created by Queen Victoria in 1874 and bestowed upon Hugh Grosvenor, 3rd Marquess of Westminster. It is the most recent dukedom conferred on someone not related to the British royal family.

The 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th Dukes were each grandsons of the first. The present holder of the title is Hugh Grosvenor, the 7th Duke, who inherited the dukedom on 9 August 2016 on the death of his father, Gerald. The present duke is a godfather of Prince George of Wales.

The Duke of Westminster&#x27;s seats are at Eaton Hall, Cheshire, and at Abbeystead House, Lancashire. The family&#x27;s London town house was Grosvenor House, Park Lane, while Halkyn Castle was built as a sporting lodge for the family in the early 1800s. The traditional burial place of the Dukes is the Old Churchyard adjacent to St Mary&#x27;s Church, Eccleston.

<text>Medicine Hat is a city in southeast Alberta, Canada. It is located along the South Saskatchewan River. It is approximately east of Lethbridge and southeast of Calgary. This city and the adjacent Town of Redcliff to the northwest are within Cypress County. Medicine Hat was the eighth-largest city in Alberta in 2021 with a population of 63,271. It is also the sunniest place in Canada according to Environment and Climate Change Canada, averaging 2,544 hours of sunshine a year.

Started as a railway town, today Medicine Hat is served by the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) and the eastern terminus of the Crowsnest Highway (Highway 3). Nearby communities considered part of the Medicine Hat area include the Town of Redcliff (abutting the city&#x27;s northwest boundary) and the hamlets of Desert Blume, Dunmore, Irvine, Seven Persons, and Veinerville. The Cypress Hills (including Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park) is a relatively short distance (by car) to the southeast of the city.

Historically, Medicine Hat has been known for its large natural gas fields, being immortalized by Rudyard Kipling as having &quot;all hell for a basement&quot;. Because of these reserves, the city is known as &quot;The Gas City&quot;.

In 2021, Medicine Hat became the first city in Canada to achieve &quot;functional zero&quot; chronic homelessness, defined as three consecutive months where three or fewer individuals experienced chronic homelessness. They were able to achieve this due to their adoption of a Housing First policy to combat homelessness beginning in 2009.

== History ==

=== Name origins and ancient history===
The name &quot;Medicine Hat&quot; is an English interpretation of &quot;Saamis&quot; (SA-MUS) – the Blackfoot word for the eagle tail feather headdress worn by medicine men. Several legends are associated with the name of a mythical mer-man river serpent named &quot;Soy-yee-daa-bee&quot; – the Creator – who appeared to a hunter and instructed him to sacrifice his wife to get mystical powers which were manifested in a special hat. Another legend tells of a battle long ago between the Blackfoot and the Cree in which a retreating Cree &quot;Medicine Man&quot; lost his headdress in the South Saskatchewan River.

A number of natural factors have always made Medicine Hat a gathering place. The gently sloping valley with its converging waterways and hardy native cottonwood trees attracted both the migratory bison herds which passed through the area, and humans who used the waterways and hunted the bison. Before Europeans arrived, the historic Blackfoot, Cree and Assiniboine nations used the area for hundreds of years, and were preceded for thousands of years by previous indigenous cultures.

Beginning in 1971, archeological excavations supervised by scholars from Medicine Hat College (MHC) were conducted at what became known as Saamis Archeological Site along Seven Persons Creek, near a historic Blackfoot buffalo jump. These revealed numerous artifacts associated with bands of First Nations ancestors, known as the Old Women&#x27;s Phase to archeologists. They found &quot;quantities of stone tools, fire cracked rock, butchered bone and pottery&quot;, marking this as an important spot. Most of the bones were identified as bison. Additional excavations were conducted in 1972 and 1973, and a field school for college students was based there. They &quot;excavated and mapped over 3,200 sq. ft. of living floors and nearly 80 features including hearths and stone boiling pits. Radiocarbon dates indicate the Saamis Site was initially occupied about AD 1500 and again around AD 1750&quot;, well before most European contact.

Also in this area, further to the west, other MHC students and faculty were part of an excavation in 2000 at what became known as the Hillside Campsite, where two layers of finds were made. The upper layer had artifacts from the Old Women&#x27;s Phase, but the lower layers were found to be much older, containing Pelican Lake Phase remains that were dated to between 1000 and 1500 BC.

=== Modern founding ===

In 1883, when the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) reached Medicine Hat and crossed the river, European Canadians established a town site. They named it from the First Nations legends. As growth took place, in 1889 Medicine Hat built the first hospital west of Winnipeg. The CPR established this town as a railway divisional point. The frontier settlement was incorporated as a town on October 31, 1898. In 1905 when the province of Alberta was founded, it took in Medicine Hat, which had formerly been in the district of Assiniboia. Medicine Hat was incorporated as a city on May 9, 1906. The depot itself is still standing and has been a National Historic Site itself since 1992.

Medicine Hat is halfway between Winnipeg and Vancouver, British Columbia, on the Pacific Coast.

=== Industrialization and growth ===
Rich in natural resources including natural gas, coal, clay, and farmland, the town became industrialized and was known in its early days as &quot;the Pittsburgh of the West&quot;. A number of large industries located here, attracted by the cheap and plentiful energy resources. Coal mines, brick works, pottery and glass bottle manufacturing plants, flour mills, etc. became established. Altaglass, an art and functional glass production company operated in Medicine Hat from 1950 to 1988. With transportation access via the railway and river, the town became a service and trade center for the agriculture and its products, both commodity crops and livestock, of the surrounding area. Between 1909 and 1914 the town had an economic boom that increased the population to more than 10,000. Little growth occurred between the World Wars.

During World War II, one of the largest prisoner-of-war camps (POW) in Canada was established here in January 1943 and was used primarily to hold German and Italian prisoners until April 1946. It was not until the 1950s of the post-war period that the town again had commercial growth.

In the 21st century, Medicine Hat promotes its quality of life and affordable cost of living, enjoying the savings of a city-owned gas utility and power generation plant. Major industries have included chemical plants, a Goodyear tire and rubber plant, greenhouses, numerous oil and gas related companies, a foundry, I-XL Industries (a brickworks dating from the 1880s), to name a few. Friends of Medalta is a non-profit that has been formed to preserve some of the city&#x27;s industrial heritage.

== Geography ==
The Medicine Hat landscape is dominated by the South Saskatchewan River valley. In addition, the tributaries Seven Persons Creek and Ross Creek both flow into the South Saskatchewan River within the boundaries of the city. These waterways have cut a dramatic valley landscape with numerous cliffs, and finger coulees throughout the city.

== Economy ==
Medicine Hat&#x27;s economy is characterized by diversification and resilience, though it still reflects its historical roots in natural resources. The city&#x27;s early reliance on natural gas and clay shaped its economic development, the decline of the natural gas sector has pushed Medicine Hat to adapt and evolve in recent decades.

In the past, natural gas was the backbone of Medicine Hat&#x27;s economy, earning the city the nickname &quot;The Gas City&quot;. However, the fluctuating prices of natural gas, particularly in the 2000s, forced the city to pivot. In 2019, Medicine Hat announced plans to close roughly 2,000 of its natural gas wells, signaling a clear shift away from fossil fuel dependence. This transition has been part of a broader effort to move toward more sustainable and diverse economic drivers.

While the gas industry may have declined, manufacturing continues to be a crucial sector. The city is home to significant industrial operations, including a large Goodyear tire and rubberplant, a Methanex methanol production facility, and other manufacturing businesses. This sector plays a key role in providing employment and maintaining economic stability, with industries ranging from automotive to chemicals and construction materials.

One of the most notable developments in recent years has been Medicine Hat&#x27;s growing role in the tech and energy sectors. The city is home to Canada&#x27;s largest Bitcoin mine, a reflection of its embrace of technological and digital economies. With its abundant energy resources, including renewable energy projects, Medicine Hat is positioning itself as a center for innovative energy solutions, including cryptocurrency mining and sustainable energy production.

Agriculture remains a significant component of Medicine Hat&#x27;s economy. The city is home to Big Marble Farms, Alberta&#x27;s largest greenhouse operation. The region&#x27;s fertile soil supports a robust agricultural base, with diverse activities including crop production, livestock farming, and agribusiness ventures. Additionally, Medicine Hat benefits from its close proximity to the broader agricultural heartland of southern Alberta, further strengthening its agricultural ties.

Medicine Hat is located near the Suffield military base, Canada&#x27;s largest military training area. This proximity provides economic benefits through defense contracts, research, and employment related to military operations.

While not the dominant driver of the economy, tourism is increasingly important. Medicine Hat&#x27;s historical landmarks, parks, and events attract visitors, while the city&#x27;s retail sector continues to grow, supported by both local demand and its role as a regional service center.

Medicine Hat&#x27;s economy today is far more diversified than it was in the past. While manufacturing and agriculture remain pillars, the city has embraced technological innovation and continues to seek opportunities in emerging industries. The shift away from a sole dependence on natural gas has been a defining feature of its modern economic landscape, setting the stage for a more sustainable and adaptive future.

Commissioned for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary as a symbol of Canada&#x27;s Plains Indians, it stood high (more than 20 storeys) and is in diameter at the base. The sculpture was designed by Steve Illes of steel and concrete. He had the teepee painted &quot;white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun, and blue for flowing waters&quot;.

<text>Siol nan Gaidheal (, meaning &quot;Seed of the Gaels&quot;) is a minor Scottish ultranationalist and ethnic nationalist group which describes itself as a &quot;cultural and fraternal organisation&quot;.

The first incarnation of the group was founded by Tom Moore in 1978, though it became defunct twice and was re-established by Jackie Stokes in 1987 and again in 1997.

Though the group publicly disavows politics, SnG has been variously described by commentators as anywhere from &quot;traditionalist&quot; to &quot;crypto-fascist&quot; or &quot;proto-fascist&quot;. Members of the group have been banned from membership of the mainstream nationalist Scottish National Party since 1982.

==Name==
The name, properly spelled (), is Scottish Gaelic for &#x27;Seed of the Gaels&#x27;. The term has numerous meanings, most commonly translated as &quot;breed, brood, lineage, progeny, seed&quot;.

==History==
===First incarnation (19781985)===
The first incarnation of Siol nan Gaidheal was founded in 1978 by Tom Moore, a Scot who spent his childhood in the USA. It grew in the immediate aftermath of the 1979 devolution referendum, despite being shunned by the mainstream nationalist SNP, whose ruling executive attempted to ban SnG from the party as early as 1980. In September 1980, the SNP launched an inquiry into the group, with Colin Bell as vice-chairman. SnG was fully proscribed after the SNP&#x27;s 1982 conference. The 1320 Club, which was banned by the SNP in 1968, merged into SnG in the same year.

Throughout the 1980s, Siol nan Gaidheal published a magazine called [sic] (&quot;Scottish Truth&quot;), which has been described as having a rhetoric which was &quot;anti-communist, neo-fascist and sometimes violent in tone&quot;. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s personal security was stepped up in Scotland after members of SnG tried to accost her outside the Conservative Party conference in Perth in 1982. Some members of SnG formed an unofficial paramilitary wing called (AnG; &quot;Army of the Gael&quot;), which was responsible for a number of petrol bomb attacks in 1982 and 1983. Against the background of internal division and arrests of members, the first incarnation of Siol nan Gaidheal eventually folded in 1985.

===Second incarnation (198790s)===

Siol nan Gaidheal was re-established in 1987 by Jackie Stokes, a member of the Scottish Republican Socialist Party. This second incarnation of the group explicitly rejected violence. By 1988, it claimed a membership of 300. Its activities included, in 1989, erecting a cairn in memory of Willie McRae—who was sympathetic to SNG, and possibly at one point a member—along with Michael Strathern. By the early 1990s, however, Stokes had suffered a heart attack and then kidney problems, which effectively killed the organisation.

===Third incarnation (1997present)===
Jackie Stokes eventually re-established Siol nan Gaidheal for a second time in 1997, this time concentrating mainly on its website and online discussion forum. Chapters were set up in the United States of America and in Canada as a focus for the Scottish diaspora in North America. Stokes died on 24 July 2001, leading to a downturn in the group&#x27;s activity. In May 2006, SnG held its first Ard Fhèis (party annual conference) in 14 years, in Dalwhinnie, Scotland.

Siol nan Gaidheal actively campaigned during the 2014 independence referendum, though the mainstream Yes Scotland campaign distanced itself from SnG. The group made headlines in the run-up to the referendum for heckling Labour MP Jim Murphy on his visits to Dundee and Montrose.

On 11 January 2020 the &quot;All Under One Banner&quot; pro-independence demonstration in Glasgow marched behind a banner badged with the Siol nan Gaidheal symbol.

In June 2022, SNP MSP Evelyn Tweed apologised after being photographed holding the flag of Siol nan Gaidheal.

==Aim and ideology==

<doc id="242736" wikidata="Q336580" url="?curid=242736" title="Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster">
<text>Major General Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster (22 December 1951 – 9 August 2016) was a British landowner, businessman, aristocrat, Territorial Army general, and peer. He was the son of Robert Grosvenor, 5th Duke of Westminster, and Viola Lyttelton. He was Chairman of the property company Grosvenor Group. In the first-ever edition of &quot;The Sunday Times Rich List&quot;, published in 1989, he was ranked as the second richest person in the United Kingdom, with a fortune of £3.2 billion (approximately £ in today&#x27;s value), with only the late Queen Elizabeth II above him.

Born in Northern Ireland, Grosvenor moved from an island in the middle of Lower Lough Erne to be educated at Sunningdale and Harrow boarding schools in the south of England. After a troubled education, he left school with two O-levels. He entered the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, and served in the Territorial Army, where he was promoted to major-general in 2004.

Via Grosvenor Estates, the business he inherited along with the dukedom in 1979, the Duke was the richest property developer in the United Kingdom and one of the country&#x27;s largest landowners, with property in Edinburgh, Liverpool, Oxford, Cambridge, Southampton and Cheshire, including the family&#x27;s country seat of Eaton Hall, as well as of Mayfair and Belgravia in Central London. The business also has interests in other parts of Europe. According to &quot;The Sunday Times Rich List&quot; in 2016, the Duke was worth £9.35 billion, placing him sixth on the list and making him the third-richest British citizen.

The Duke died on 9 August 2016 after suffering a heart attack. The titles then passed to his only son, Hugh.

==Family and other businesses==
The Grosvenor family&#x27;s first development was in Mayfair, Central London, in the early 18th century; the second big development came around 100 years later and was in another exclusive part of London – Belgravia, developed by the family after the end of Napoleonic Wars and the conversion of Buckingham Palace – which is just one mile east. After developing the two parts of Central London, the family business expanded. During the second half of the 20th century, the business expanded into the Americas and developed Annacis Island and Vancouver, both in British Columbia in the west of Canada in the 1950s. The family business started developing in Australia in the 1960s. They moved to Asia in the early 1990s and to Continental Europe just before the millennium. In April 2000, the firm moved into new London offices. The business was headed by the 6th Duke himself, who was Chairman of the Trustees.

The Duke was also Director of Claridge&#x27;s Hotel from 1981 until 1993, and of Marcher Sound from 1992 until 1997.

==Early life==
As a child, the Duke lived on an island in the middle of Lower Lough Erne in Northern Ireland (Ely Lodge, Blaney, County Fermanagh). His early education was in Northern Ireland before he was sent at age 7 to Sunningdale School in Ascot, followed by Harrow. Because of his Fermanagh accent, the Duke struggled to fit in at first, and even after his accent was &quot;bullied&quot; out of him, he found it difficult to make friends. Unhappy at boarding school, his education suffered. He left school with two O-levels in history and English.

==Military career==
As Earl Grosvenor he joined the Territorial Army in 1970, as a trooper, family estate responsibilities having caused him to abandon a Regular Army career in the 9th/12th Lancers. After entering RMA Sandhurst in 1973, he passed out as an officer cadet and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve of the Royal Armoured Corps (Queen&#x27;s Own Yeomanry) on 13 May 1973. He was promoted to lieutenant on 13 May 1975 and to captain on 1 July 1980. He was promoted to the acting rank of major on 1 January 1985 and to the substantive rank on 22 December.

Promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 1 April 1992, he subsequently commanded the North Irish Horse, the Cheshire Yeomanry Squadron, founded by his ancestors, and the Queen&#x27;s Own Yeomanry. He was promoted to colonel on 31 December 1994 and was appointed honorary colonel of the 7th Regt Army Air Corps (1 January 1996) and the Northumbrian Universities Officer Training Corps (30 November 1995). Promoted to brigadier on 17 January 2000, he was also appointed Honorary Colonel of the Royal Mercian and Lancastrian Yeomanry on 14 May 2001. He was also appointed Colonel-in-Chief of the Canadian Royal Westminster Regiment, the North Irish Horse, and as Colonel Commandant Yeomanry.

The Duke was Grand Prior of the Priory of England of the Military and Hospitaller Order of St Lazarus of Jerusalem, 1995–2001. In 2004, he was appointed to the new post of Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff (Reserves and Cadets), with promotion in the rank of major-general. In March 2007, having served in the Ministry of Defence as Assistant CDS for four years, he handed over responsibility for 50,000 reservists and 138,000 cadets to Major General Simon Lalor, in the wake of the Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal in which Westminster was also implicated. The Duke became Deputy Commander Land Forces (Reserves) in May 2011. He retired from the Armed Forces in 2012.

===Benevolent work for service personnel===
The Duke was President of the BLESMA from 1992, and the Yeomanry Benevolent Fund from 2005, national Vice-President of the Royal British Legion from 1993, and the Reserve Forces&#x27; Ulysses Trust from 1995, the Not Forgotten Society from 2004, and Chairman of the Nuffield Trust for the Forces of the Crown from 1992, all until his death. He was Vice-President of the Royal Engineers Music Foundation 1990–94.

In 2011, having already funded a feasibility study, the Duke purchased the estate at Stanford Hall, Nottinghamshire, to make possible the creation of a Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre (DNRC) to provide the highest quality support for military casualties. Work started on the £300m project in April 2016, and was completed in 2018 to replace those at Headley Court. The Duke remained actively involved in the project until his death.

He was Vice-President of the Royal United Services Institute from 1993 until 2012, President of The Tank Museum, Bovington, from 2002, and a committee member of the National Army Museum between 1988–1997 and from 2013 until his death. He was one of the founding trustees on the creation of National Museums Liverpool in 1986. 

==Educational interests==
Despite his poor educational attainments, Westminster was given several honorary degrees and fellowships (listed below) in later life and took an outward-looking interest in youth. He was Director of the International Students Trust from 1976 until 1993, Pro-Chancellor of Keele University from 1986 until 1993, Chancellor of Manchester Metropolitan University from 1992 until 2002, and first appointed Chancellor of the University of Chester in 2005, serving until his death.

He was a supporter of The Prince&#x27;s Trust and was a committee member of the Trust and a Patron from 2001 for North West England.

==Sports interests and conservation work==
His main personal recreations were field shooting and fishing. He served as President of the Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust for 1987–2000 and Vice-President thereafter, President of the British Association for Shooting and Conservation from 1992 until 2000, and the Atlantic Salmon Trust from 2004 until his death. He was a member of the MCC and Royal Yacht Squadron and President of Worcestershire County Cricket Club in 1984–1986 and of the Youth Sports Trust 1996–2004.

He was President of the committee planning the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester from 1998, and from 1991 until 1994 had been Director of the committee set up to coordinate the projected 2000 Summer Olympic Games and Paralympics that would have been held at Manchester had the British bid succeeded.

==Personal life==
The Duke of Westminster married Natalia Ayesha Phillips, the daughter of Lt-Col. Harold Pedro Joseph Phillips and his wife Georgina Wernher, in 1978. Their children are:

* Lady Tamara Katherine Grosvenor (born 20 December 1979), married Edward van Cutsem (son of Hugh van Cutsem) on 6 November 2004.
* Lady Edwina Louise Grosvenor (born 4 November 1981). She is a prison reformer and philanthropist, co-founding The Clink Restaurants. She married historian and television presenter Dan Snow on 27 November 2010.
* Hugh Grosvenor, 7th Duke of Westminster (born 29 January 1991). He is the godfather of Prince George of Wales and Prince Archie of Sussex. He married Olivia Henson on 7 June 2024 at Chester Cathedral
* Lady Viola Georgina Grosvenor (born 12 October 1992), married Angus Roberts, of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, in 2022.

In 1998, the Duke suffered a nervous breakdown and had depression, citing the overwhelming pressures of business and public life. His depression worsened after reports in newspapers that he had employed the services of prostitutes.

==Death==
The Duke died on 9 August 2016 at Royal Preston Hospital in Preston, Lancashire, after suffering a heart attack at his Abbeystead Estate. A private funeral attended by close relatives was held on 12 August, and a memorial service was held at Chester Cathedral on 28 November. He is buried in the family plot at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Eccleston.

That the Grosvenor family stood to pay very little, if any, inheritance tax on his £9 billion fortune led to calls for a review of how the inheritance of trust funds and similar assets are handled in the UK.

<text>Abraham Holzmann (19 August 1874 – 16 January 1939) was an American composer, famous for his march &quot;Blaze Away!&quot;.

==Life and career==
Abraham Holzmann was born in New York City on 19 August 1874. His parents were Jacob Holzmann, a Hungarian-Jewish immigrant and Isabella Holzmann, a native of Louisiana. The young Holzmann learned music in Germany. A review originally published by the New York Herald on Sunday, 13 January 1901, entitled &quot;German Composer who Writes American Cakewalk Music&quot; describes &quot;[h]is knowledge of bass and counterpoint is thorough, and his standard compositions bear the stamp of harmonic lore, which makes his proclivity for the writing of the popular style of music the more remarkable.&quot;

Abe married Isabelle Fishblatt around 1908, and he became the manager of the Orchestra Department at Jerome Remick &amp; Company, music publisher in New York.
He was an early member (1923) of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). He earned his livelihood as composer/arranger for Tin Pan Alley publishers, including Leo Feist. He later was advertising manager for the American Federation of Musicians publication, International Musician. He was a member of Freemasonry, the Elks, and Knights of Pythias, all in New York City.

Holzmann died in East Orange, New Jersey at age 64 on 16 January 1939. He was survived by his widow, a daughter Natalie Holzmann, three half-brothers, and four sisters. His music was especially revered by ragtime enthusiasts, although he composed marches, waltzes, and other light music.

His 1899 composition &quot;Smokey Mokes&quot; was briefly featured in the 1936 movie &quot;San Francisco&quot;.

<text>The University of Texas System (UT System) is a public university system in the U.S. state of Texas. It includes nine universities and five independent health institutions. The UT System is headquartered in Downtown Austin. It is the largest university system in Texas with 250,000+ enrolled students, 21,000+ employed faculty, 83,000+ health care professionals, researchers and support staff. The UT System&#x27;s $47.5 billion endowment (as of the 2024 fiscal year) is the largest of any public university system in the United States.

==Component institutions==

===Academic institutions===
The University of Texas System has nine universities that each confers its own degrees. 
==== Addition of Stephen F. Austin State University ====
On November 29, 2022, the Board of Regents of Stephen F. Austin State University (SFA) announced their decision to accept an invitation to join the UT System. This decision occurred following an announcement at the start of the fall semester by SFA President Steve Westbrook that the board was considering joining a system. At the time, Stephen F. Austin was one of two independent public universities in Texas, alongside Texas Southern University. The Texas A&amp;M University System, the Texas Tech University System, and the Texas State University System all extended invitations as well. The decision to join the UT System was made following a process that included faculty, staff, student, and alumni input. Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s addition to the UT System was approved by the Texas Legislature during the 2023 session. The identically worded House and Senate bills that would formally add SFA to the UT System specified that SFA would retain its name, but with the phrase &quot;a member of The University of Texas System&quot; appended to the legal school name. They also stated that SFA would be technically dissolved and then immediately reconstituted as a member of the UT System. The Senate unanimously passed its bill on April 16, 2023, and the House passed its version on April 26. Governor Greg Abbott signed the measure into law on May 10.

==== UT Brownsville and UT Pan American (UTRGV) merger ====
On June 14, 2013, Texas Governor Rick Perry signed a law officially approving the creation of a new university in South Texas within the UT System and replacing UT Brownsville and UT Pan American. The initiative resulted in a single institution, including a medical school, spanning the entire Rio Grande Valley, with a presence in each of the major metropolitan areas of Brownsville, Edinburg, Harlingen, and McAllen. On December 12, 2013, the UT Board of Regents voted to name the new university the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. The new university began full operation in the 2015–16 school year.
==== UT Tyler and UTHSC Tyler merger ====
In December 2019, the UT System Board of Regents unanimously agreed to merge The University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler (UTHSCT) under The University of Texas at Tyler (UTT), creating a single unified institution. Two months later, the UT System formally announced its intention to establish a new medical school that will be added under the new unified UT Tyler administration. It will be the first medical school in the East Texas region.

On December 8, 2020, The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Schools approved a plan to merge UT Tyler and UTHSCT. UTHSCT will retain its status as a health-related institution but will now come under the administration of UT Tyler. The UT System Board of Regents met in late December 2020 and took action on the implementation of the merger which began on January 1, 2021.

On January 4, 2021, the Board of Regents installed Kirk A. Calhoun, M.D. as president of the newly aligned UT Tyler and UTHSCT. As of January 4, these two institutions are officially one. On January 15, 2021 the institution publicly named the new line of executive leadership for the merged institution.

The medical school is expected to open in 2023.

=== Health institutions ===
The University of Texas System has 5 independent health institutions. None are officially associated with any of the 4-year academic institutions, though some may have close relationships or special joint programs with them due to geographical location (Dallas–Fort Worth area institutions &amp; San Antonio institutions) or historical relationships (UT Austin &amp; UT Medical Branch at Galveston).

UT MD Anderson Cancer Center is one of the six schools at UT Health Science Center at Houston. Despite being officially associated under UT Houston, the UT System lists MD Anderson as a separate health institution due to its unique specialization.

Additionally, there are medical schools at UT Austin and UT Rio Grande Valley that are not directly affiliated with any of the independent health institutions. The third medical school organized under an academic institution in the UT System is UT Tyler Medical School, which began operations in 2023.

==== Independent UT Health institutions ====
==== Medical schools within academic institutions ====
==== Pending mergers ====
San Antonio

In 2010, a study was commissioned to explore the possibility of merging UT San Antonio and UT Health San Antonio. Officials ultimately decided against it, citing significant costs, administrative challenges, and different university cultures. In 2016, an op-ed published in the San Antonio Express-News urged the UT System Board of Regents to reconsider their decision. It was announced in August 2024 that the Board of Regent voted to merge the two into one university, a merger set to be completed by 2025

==== Attempted academic and health institutions and mergers ====
Dallas–Fort Worth

In 2001 the 77th Texas Legislature proposed HB 3568, which would have merged all Dallas–Fort Worth UT System institutions (UT Dallas, UT Arlington, and UT Southwestern) under the name &quot;The University of Texas at Dallas&quot;. UTD&#x27;s Richardson campus would have been designated as the main campus, UTA&#x27;s Arlington campus would have become a satellite campus, and UTSW&#x27;s Dallas campus would have become the merged university&#x27;s medical school. The purpose was to help the metroplex gain one unified flagship-level university, but the House Bill ultimately failed to pass due to objections from UT Arlington (which wanted to retain its identity as a separate university) and the lack of time to properly explain the complex process to state representatives.

Houston

In 2015, the UT System purchased 300 acres of land in the Houston area for $215 million for the development of a research campus, spearheaded by then-Chancellor William H. McRaven. While the UT System publicly denied plans to build a new university on the land, the land acquisition drew criticism from the University of Houston System and several Texas State Senators, notably John Whitmire, focusing on the UT System encroaching on the UH System, given the UT System&#x27;s access to the Permanent University Fund, as well as the process by which the land was purchased. In 2017, the UT System announced it would be cancelling plans for the Houston campus.

==Administration==

The administrative offices are in Downtown Austin. The UT system approved moving the system headquarters in November 2012. Bonds from the UT System&#x27;s endowment funded the construction of the new 19-story, headquarters, which had a price tag of $102 million. The UT System planned to lease a portion of the facility for shops and other offices, with the approximately remaining portion used for its own employees. The system headquarters opened on August 1, 2017.

In July 2018, the Pentagon announced it had selected the UT System administrative building as the headquarters for the Army Futures Command, a new organization committed to coordinating modernization efforts and integrating innovation across the Army.

The University of Texas System was previously headquartered in O. Henry Hall in Downtown Austin. The system headquarters complex previously included multiple buildings, which had 550 employees in 2014. These facilities included O. Henry Hall, Claudia Taylor Johnson Hall (named after Lady Bird Johnson), Ashbel Smith Hall, the Colorado Building, and the Lavaca Building,

In 2013 the UT system approved the demolitions of the Colorado Building and the Lavaca Building, and the new UT System headquarters was built where these buildings previously stood. The Texas State University System purchased O. Henry Hall in 2015 for $8.2 million; the UT System leased it and continued using it as its administrative headquarters prior to the 2017 completion of the UT System&#x27;s current headquarters. The UT System leased the land containing Claudia Taylor Johnson Hall and Ashbel Smith Hall to Trammell Crow which is constructing a commercial property on the site that uses the facade of Johnson Hall. Ashbel Smith Hall was imploded on March 25, 2018.

==Coordinated Admissions Program==
The Coordinated Admissions Program (CAP) offers some UT Austin applicants the chance to attend the university if they complete their freshman year at another system school and meet specified requirements. Each institution in the University of Texas System sets its own admissions standards, and not all schools may accept a particular CAP student.

UT Dallas does not participate in the CAP program, and University of Texas at San Antonio, the largest recipient of CAP students, has stated that it will be phasing out the program within the next ten years.

<doc id="242748" wikidata="Q7835333" url="?curid=242748" title="Transposition table">
<text>A transposition table is a cache of previously seen positions, and associated evaluations, in a game tree generated by a computer game playing program. If a position recurs via a different sequence of moves, the value of the position is retrieved from the table, avoiding re-searching the game tree below that position. Transposition tables are primarily useful in perfect-information games (where the entire state of the game is known to all players at all times). The usage of transposition tables is essentially memoization applied to the tree search and is a form of dynamic programming. 

Transposition tables are typically implemented as hash tables encoding the current board position as the hash index. The number of possible positions that may occur in a game tree is an exponential function of depth of search, and can be thousands to millions or even much greater. Transposition tables may therefore consume most of available system memory and are usually most of the memory footprint of game playing programs.

== Functionality ==
Game-playing programs work by analyzing millions of positions that could arise in the next few moves of the game. Typically, these programs employ strategies resembling depth-first search, which means that they do not keep track of all the positions analyzed so far. In many games, it is possible to reach a given position in more than one way. These are called transpositions. In chess, for example, the sequence of moves &quot;1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6&quot; (see algebraic chess notation) has 4 possible transpositions, since either player may swap their move order. In general, after &quot;n&quot; moves, an upper limit on the possible transpositions is (&quot;n&quot;!)2. Although many of these are illegal move sequences, it is still likely that the program will end up analyzing the same position several times.

To avoid this problem, transposition tables are used. Such a table is a hash table of each of the positions analyzed so far up to a certain depth. On encountering a new position, the program checks the table to see whether the position has already been analyzed; this can be done quickly, in amortized constant time. If so, the table contains the value that was previously assigned to this position; this value is used directly. If not, the value is computed, and the new position is entered into the hash table.

The number of positions searched by a computer often greatly exceeds the memory constraints of the system it runs on; thus not all positions can be stored. When the table fills up, less-used positions are removed to make room for new ones; this makes the transposition table a kind of cache.

The computation saved by a transposition table lookup is not just the evaluation of a single position. Instead, the evaluation of an entire subtree is avoided. Thus, transposition table entries for nodes at a shallower depth in the game tree are more valuable (since the size of the subtree rooted at such a node is larger) and are therefore given more importance when the table fills up and some entries must be discarded.

The hash table implementing the transposition table can have other uses than finding transpositions. In alpha–beta pruning, the search is fastest (in fact, optimal) when the child of a node corresponding to the best move is always considered first. Of course, there is no way of knowing the best move beforehand, but when iterative deepening is used, the move that was found to be the best in a shallower search is a good approximation. Therefore this move is tried first. For storing the best child of a node, the entry corresponding to that node in the transposition table is used.

Use of a transposition table can lead to incorrect results if the graph-history interaction problem is not studiously avoided. This problem arises in certain games because the history of a position may be important. For example, in chess a player may not castle if the king or the rook to be castled with has moved during the course of the game. A common solution to this problem is to add the castling rights as part of the Zobrist hashing key. Another example is draw by repetition: given a position, it may not be possible to determine whether it has already occurred. A solution to the general problem is to store history information in each node of the transposition table, but this is inefficient and rarely done in practice.
== Replacement strategies ==
A transposition table is a cache whose maximum size is limited by available system memory, and it may overflow at any time. In fact, it is expected to overflow, and the number of positions cacheable at any time may be only a small fraction (even orders of magnitude smaller) than the number of nodes in the game tree. The vast majority of nodes are not transposition nodes, i.e. positions that will recur, so effective replacement strategies that retain potential transposition nodes and replace other nodes can result in significantly reduced tree size. Replacement is usually based on tree depth and aging: nodes higher in the tree (closer to the root) are favored, because the subtrees below them are larger and result in greater savings; and more recent nodes are favored because older nodes are no longer similar to the current position, so transpositions to them are less likely.

Other strategies are to retain nodes in the principal variation, nodes with larger subtrees regardless of depth in the tree, and nodes that caused cutoffs.

== Size and performance ==
Though the fraction of nodes that will be transpositions is small, the game tree is an exponential structure, so caching a very small number of such nodes can make a significant difference. In chess, search time reductions of 0-50% in complex middle game positions and up to a factor of 5 in the end game have been reported.

==Related techniques==
* Similar techniques can be used to cache evaluations of certain features of a position. For example, a &quot;pawn hash table&quot; can be used to store an evaluation of the pawn structures in a position. Since the number of pawn positions examined is generally much smaller than the total number of positions searched, the pawn hash table has a very high hit rate, allowing a program to spend more time on sophisticated pawn evaluations because they are reused many times.
* A &quot;refutation table&quot; can be used to store sequences of moves from the root node to leaf nodes. This includes the principal variation and responses to other lines showing that they are inferior. Refutation tables were sometimes used instead of transposition tables in the earlier years of computer chess, when memory was more limited. Some modern chess programs use refutation tables in addition to transposition tables for move ordering, while most do not use them at all.
*Static bitmaps of the possible moves of each type of piece on each space of the board can be cached at program initialization, so that the legal moves of a piece (or together, all legal moves for move generation) can be retrieved with a single memory load instead of having to be serially enumerated. These are commonly used in bitboard implementations.

<doc id="242751" wikidata="Q2887576" url="?curid=242751" title="Permian Basin (North America)">
<text>The Permian Basin is a large sedimentary basin in the southwestern part of the United States. It is the highest producing oil field in the United States, producing an average of 4.2 million barrels of crude oil per day in 2019. This sedimentary basin is located in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico. 

It is named after the Permian geologic period, the final period of the Paleozoic era, as it contains some of the world&#x27;s thickest deposits of rocks from the period.

The Permian Basin comprises several component basins, including the Midland Basin, which is the largest; Delaware Basin, the second largest; and Marfa Basin, the smallest. The Permian Basin covers more than , and extends across an area approximately wide and long.

The Texas cities of Midland, Odessa and San Angelo serve as headquarters for some of the oil production activities in the basin.

The Permian Basin is also a major source of potassium salts (potash). Potash mines are located in Lea and Eddy counties, New Mexico, and are operated by the room and pillar method. Halite (rock salt) is produced as a byproduct of potash mining.

== Components ==

=== Delaware Basin ===

The Delaware Basin is the larger of the two major lobes of the Permian Basin within the foreland of the Ouachita–Marathon thrust belt separated by the Central Basin Platform. The basin contains sediment dating to Pennsylvanian, Wolfcampian (Neal Ranch and Lenox Hills Formations), Leonardian (Avalon Shale), and early Guadalupian times. The eastward-dipping Delaware basin is subdivided into several formations (figure2) and contains about of laminated siltstone and sandstone. Aside from clastic sediment, the Delaware basin also contains carbonate deposits of the Delaware Mountain Group, originating from the Guadalupian times when the Hovey Channel allowed access from the sea into the basin.

=== Midland Basin ===
The westward-dipping Midland Basin is subdivided into several formations (figure 4) and is composed of laminated siltstone and sandstone. The Midland Basin was filled by a large subaqueous delta that deposited clastic sediment into the basin. Aside from clastic sediment, the Midland Basin also contains carbonate deposits originating from the Guadalupian times when the Hovey Channel allowed access from the sea into the basin.

=== Central Basin Platform ===

The Central Basin Platform (CBP) is a tectonically uplifted basement block capped by a carbonate platform. The CBP separates the Delaware and Midland Basins and is subdivided into several formations, from oldest to youngest Neal Ranch, Lennox Hills, Abo, Yeso, Glorieta, San Andres, Grayburg, Queen, Seven Rivers, Yates, and Tansill Formations (Figure5). The sequence mainly comprises carbonate reef deposits and shallow marine clastic sediments.

=== Eastern and Northwest Shelves ===
The Eastern and Northwestern Shelves are composed of shelf edge reefs and shelf carbonates flanking the Delaware and Midland Basins that grade up-dip into siltstones and evaporites. The Eastern and Northwestern Shelves are subdivided into the San Andres, Grayburg, Queen, Seven Rivers, Yates, and Tansill Formations.

=== San Simon Channel ===
The San Simon Channel is a narrow syncline that separated the Central Basin Platform from the Northwestern Shelf during Leonardian and Guadalupian times.

=== Sheffield Channel ===
The Sheffield Channel separates the southern margin of the Midland Basin from the southern shelf and the Ouachita–Marathon thrust-belt during Leonardian and Guadalupian times.

=== Hovey Channel ===
The Hovey Channel is a topographical low located on the southern edge of the Delaware Basin, allowing access to the Panthalassa sea during Guadalupian times. The Hovey Channel was originally an anticline which formed during Precambrian faulting, and was the main source of sea water for the Delaware Basin. The closing of the Hovey Channel towards the end of the Permian Period eventually caused the death of the Permian Reef, as without water being brought in through the Channel, salinity levels rose drastically in the Delaware Basin and the reef could not survive.

=== Horseshoe Atoll ===

The Horseshoe Atoll is a westward-tilting arcuate chain of reef mounds long located in the Midland Basin, consisting of of limestone accumulated in the Pennsylvanian and in the Permian, with 15 significant petroleum reservoirs from to in depth. The reef complex consists of Upper Pennsylvanian Strawn, Canyon and Cisco limestones, overlain by Lower Permian Wolfcamp sandstones and shales of terrigenous origin prograding northeast to southwest. The first production well, Seabird Oil Company of Delaware No.1-B J.C. Caldwell, was completed in 1948.

== Depositional history ==

The Permian Basin is the thickest deposit of Permian aged rocks on Earth which were rapidly deposited during the collision of North America and Gondwana (South America and Africa) between the late Mississippian through the Permian. The Permian Basin also includes formations that date back to the Ordovician Period, 445 million years ago (mya).

=== Proterozoic ===
Prior to the breakup of the Precambrian supercontinent and the formation of the modern Permian Basin geometry, shallow marine sedimentation onto the ancestral Tobosa Basin characterized the passive margin, shallow marine environment. The Tobosa Basin also contains basement rock that dates back to 1330 million years ago (mya), and that is still visible in the present-day Guadalupe Mountains. The basement rock contains biotite-quartz granite, discovered at a depth of . In the nearby Apache and Glass Mountains, the basement rock is made of metamorphosed sandstone and Precambrian-aged granite. The entire area is also underlain by layered mafic rocks, which are thought to be a part of Pecos Mafic Igneous Suite, and extends into the southern US. It has been dated to 1163 mya.

=== Early to Mid Paleozoic (Late Cambrian to Mississippian) ===

==== Ordovician Period (485.4–443.8 mya) ====
Each period from the Paleozoic Era has contributed a specific lithology to the Tobosa Basin, accumulating into almost of sediment at the start of the Pennsylvanian Period (323.2–298.9 mya). The Montoya Group is the youngest rock formation in the Tobosa Basin and was formed in the Ordovician Period (485.4–443.8 mya), and sit directly on the igneous and metamorphic basement rocks. The rocks from the Montoya Group are described as light to medium grey, fine to medium grained crystalline calcareous dolomite. These rocks were sometimes inter-bedded with shale, dark grey limestone, and, less commonly, chert. the Montoya Group sequence is made up of carbonate limestone and dolomite which is described as dense, impermeable, and non-porous, and is more commonly found in the Glass Mountains outcrop, with thickness varying from .

==== Silurian Period (443.8–419.2 mya) ====
During the Silurian Period, the Tobosa Basin experienced dramatic changes in sea level which led to the formation of multiple rock groups. The first of these groups, called the Fusselman Formation, is mostly made up of light grey, medium to coarse grained dolomite. The thickness of this formation varies from , and parts of the Fusselman Formation were also subject to karstification, which indicates a drop in sea level. The second rock group that formed during the Silurian Period is called the Wristen Formation, which is mud, shale, and dolomite rich rock that reaches a thickness of in some places. Karstification of the Fusselman Formation shows that a drop in sea level occurred, but sea levels rose again during a transgressive event, which lead to the creation of the Wristen Formation. Sea levels would then drop again, which led to major exposure, erosion, and karstification of these formations.

==== Devonian Period (419.2–358.9 mya) ====
The Thirtyone Formation was developed during the Devonian Period. This formation is characterized by its limestone, chert, and shale beds, some of which had a peak thickness of . this formation had many different types of limestone, including light-colored siliceous, chert-dominated, crinoid-rich, and sandy limestone. The Thirtyone Formation is very similar to the formation of the Mississippian Period, which is likely because there was little to no change in the environment during this time.

==== Mississippian Period (358.9–323.2 mya) ====
The Mississippian Limestone is the main formation to develop during this Period. This formation, similar to the previously mentioned Thirtyone Formation, is composed primarily of limestone and shale. The limestone beds are described as being &quot;brown to dark brown, micro-crystalline to very finely crystalline, commonly sandy, and dolomitic&quot;, while the shale beds are &quot;grey to black, hard, platy, pyritic, organic, and very siliceous&quot;. The Mississippian Limestone ranges from in thickness, while generally being thinner towards the southern part of the Tobosa Basin.

The Barnett Shale is the second formation to have developed during the Mississippian Period. It consists mainly of silty brown shale and fine-grained sandstone and siltstone. This Formation was much thicker than the Mississippian Limestone, ranging from . The increased thickness can be explained by increased sedimentation in the area, which was likely caused by tectonic activity in the region.

===== Tectonic Activity During the Mississippian Period =====
The Ouachita Orogeny occurred during the Late Mississippian, leading to tectonic activity in the region. The subsequent folding and faulting caused by this Orogeny led to the Tobosa Basin being divided into three sections: the Delaware Basin, the Midland Basin, and the Central Basin Platform. The end of the Mississippian Period also led to the beginning of the formation of the modern Permian Reef Complex. The legacy of the early to mid Paleozoic is almost of sediments that were accumulated due to almost uninterrupted sedimentation.

=== Late Paleozoic (Pennsylvanian to Permian) ===

==== Pennsylvanian Period (323.2–298.9 mya) ====
The Pennsylvanian Period marked the beginning of geological processes that would shape the Permian Basin into what we see today. Rifting events during the Cambrian Period (early Paleozoic) left fault zones in the region. These fault zones acted as planes of weakness for faulting that was later initiated by the Ouachita Orogeny. These fault zones caused the Tobosa Basin to be transformed, due to tectonic activity, into the Permian Reef Complex, which comprises three parts: the Central Basin Platform, which is encircled by faults, and the Midland and Delaware Basins on either side. Mississippian sediments are absent either due to erosion or nondeposition. Marine shales were deposited in the center of the Delaware, Midland and Val Verde basins, while the basins&#x27; periphery saw the deposition of shallow marine, carbonate shelf and limestone sediments.

===== The Morrow Formation =====
The Early Pennsylvanian Morrow Formation underlies the Atoka Formation. The Morrow is an important reservoir consisting of clastic sediments, sandstones and shales, deposited in a deltaic environment.

===== Other formations =====
The Pennsylvanian Period also led to the development of other geologic formations, although none had the importance of the Morrow Formation. The Atoka Formation lies conformably on top of the Morrow Formation, and is characterized by its fossil-rich limestone inter-bedded with shale, reaching a max thickness of . During the formation of the Atoka, uplift was still occurring in the region, leading to increased sedimentation as the surrounding highlands were eroded. The increased sedimentation led to the formation of medium- to coarse-grained sandstone. In the Atoka Formation, the first reef structures that formed in the Delaware Basin are visible.

The Strawn Formation formed after the Atoka, also during the Pennsylvanian Period, and reached a max thickness of . In this formation, there was a significant increase in reef mounds. The Strawn Formation is primarily made up of massive limestone, along with &quot;fine to medium-grained sandstone, dark to light-grey shale, and occasional reddish-brown, greenish-gray, bituminous shale&quot;. A great number of different fossil types were preserved in this formation, including brachiopods, foraminifera, bryozoans, corals, and crinoids.

The Pennsylvanian Period also includes two other formations, the Canyon and Cisco Formations, which are significant due to the major oil reservoirs discovered in them.

==== Permian Period (298.9–251 mya) ====
The Permian Period was a time of major reef building to transform the Permian Reef Complex into a major reef system, with Permian-aged rock formations making up 95% of the present-day outcrops in the Permian Basin. When considering any type of reef building that occurred in the Permian, it is important to keep in mind that tectonics played a major part. During this period, the supercontinent of Pangaea, which lasted from 335 to 175 mya, started undergoing breakup. Pangea was clustered together near the equator and surrounded by the superocean Panthalassa, with the Permian Basin located on its western edge within 5–10 degrees of the equator. Any reef building environment would need a source of water, and the Delaware Basin was located near a marginal sea. Thanks to the Hovey Channel, this sea transported water into the Delaware Basin. Global temperatures during this time were warm, as the world climate was changing from icehouse to greenhouse. This rise in global temperatures also led to the melting of ice masses located towards the South Pole, which then led to a rise in sea levels.

The Permian Period has been split up into main Epochs, each of which has separate subdivision. In each sub epoch, a different formation was formed in the different parts of the Permian Reef Complex.

===== Cisuralian Epoch (298.9–272.3 mya) =====

The Cisuralian Epoch contained two ages, the Wolfcampian and the Leonardian, both of which have a geological formation in the Permian Basin named after them.

The Wolfcampian Formation lies conformably on top of the Pennsylvanian Formation and is the first formation from the Permian Period. Its composition varies depending on its location in the Basin, with the northernmost part being more rich in shale. The thickness of this formation also varies, reaching a maximum of . The Wolfcampian is made up primarily of grey to brown shale and fine-grained, chert-dominated, brown limestone. There are also interbedded layers of fine-grained sandstone found within the formation.

The primary formation that remains from the Leonardian Age is called the Bone Spring Limestone, which reaches a max thickness of and lies directly below the Capitan Reef Complex. The Bone Spring limestone can be divided into two formations: the Victorio Peak Member, which consists of massive beds of limestone measuring up to ; and the Cutoff Shale Member, which is formed from black, platy, siliceous shale and shaley sandstone. The Bone Spring Limestone consists of several fossils, such as bryozoans, crinoids, and spirifers, but lack algae and sponges that are plentiful in the rest of the Permian Reef Complex. Rocks from the Bone Spring Limestone are predominantly found in the Delaware Basin, but the Victorio Peak Member extends into the shelf margin area.

===== Guadalupian Epoch (272.3–259.8 mya) =====
The Guadalupian Epoch was named after the Guadalupe Mountains, since this epoch in the Permian is when reef building was at its most efficient. Lasting from approximately 272–260 mya, this epoch was dominated by the Delaware Mountain Group, which can be further subdivided into rock divisions based on location in the Permian Reef Complex.

====== Brushy Canyon Formation ======
The first formation that makes up the Delaware Mountain Group is the Brushy Canyon Formation, and it lies in the Delaware Basin. The Brushy Canyon Formation is made up of thin interbedded layers of alternating fine grained and massive quartz sandstone, as well as shaley brown to black sandstone. This formation reaches a maximum thickness of but thins out significantly as it approaches the basin margins due to transgressive onlap. The Brushy Canyon Formation also contains small reef patches, ripple marks, and crossed bedded strata, that indicate that the Delaware Basin had a shallow water environment at this time.

====== Cherry Canyon Formation ======
The next unit of the Delaware Mountain Group is the Cherry Canyon, which had multiple different sub-units and extended into the Delaware Basin and the surrounding shelf environments. The Cherry Canyon Formation can be subdivided into four sub-units, each of which will be discussed briefly.

====== Lower Gateway Formation ======
The Lower Getaway member is a limestone that has different characteristics based on its location in the Delaware Basin, and contains patch reefs close to the basin margin. These reefs are often found on limestone conglomerate and breccias. The Upper Getaway Member is more consistent and is characterised as a thick bedded dolomite which integrates into the San Andres Formation as it moves toward the shelf. The middle unit of the Cherry Canyon Formation is the South Wells Member, which is composed of sandstone and integrates itself into the Goat Seep Reef as it moves towards the basin shelf.

====== Manzanita Member ======
The upper unit is the Manzanita Member, which consists of dolomite, and gets pinched out underneath the Capitan Formation as it moves into the basin margins. All four members of the Cherry Canyon Formation have undergone dolomitization near the basin margins. This is evident since the calcite/aragonite bioclastic debris that existed as a part of this formation has been preserved as molds in dolomite. It has been suggested by some authors that the clasts and debris might have been dolomitic upon deposition, but that is improbable since the debris came from the reef, which was not dolomitic.

====== Bell Canyon Formation ======
The Bell Canyon Formation is the next unit in the Delaware Mountain Group, and it is the age equivalent unit to the Capitan Reef Formation which formed on the shelf. The Bell Canyon Formation consists of &quot;un-fossiliferous, dark-gray to black, platy, fine-grained limestone&quot;. All the Cherry Canyon Formation and the bottom part of the Bell Canyon Formation have thin interbeds of dark-colored bioclastic limestone and fine-grained sandstone. As these formations move towards the basin margins, the sandstone wedges out and the limestone thickens into massive, meters thick beds, containing reef talus.

====== Goat Seep Reef Formation ======
The Goat Seep Reef Formation lies on the shelf margin and integrates with the Getaway Formation in the basin and the San Andres Formation towards the Shelf. This formation is described as thick, long, and made up entirely of massive dolomite. In the bottom half of the formation, the dolomite is stratified into massive beds. This formation also contains molds of organisms destroyed by the dolomitization process.

====== Reef building in the Guadalupian Epoch ======
The Guadalupian Epoch is one of the most successful in history in terms of reef building, since most Permian reefs reached their maximum in size, diversity, extent, and abundance during this Epoch, with the Capitan Reef being one of the most famous examples. In the Guadalupian, reefs were abundant globally, and grew in places such as the Delaware Basin, the Zechstein Basin in Eastern Europe, along the Tethys Ocean, and in cool water shelves in the Panthalassa Ocean. The end of this golden age for reef building occurred due to the &quot;end-Guadalupian reef crisis&quot;, which involved global drops in sea levels and regional salinity fluctuations. The movement and collision of micro-continents during the break up of Pangea also caused the destruction of many Guadalupian Reefs. Even with the number of reefs from that epoch that have been destroyed, there are over 100 Guadalupian reefs that remain in the world, the most from any Permian epoch.

===== Reef growth during the Late Permian =====
The growth of the Capitan Reef, which is referred to as a &quot;massive member&quot; due to it being formed from massive limestone, can be described in three stages. The first stage is the establishment of the reef and its rapid growth. Due to the slower rates of subsidence of this time, the reef was able to build itself up quickly. Once the reef reached sea level, it began to grow horizontally, since it could not grow vertically anymore. The reef environment during the first stage of development was described as warm (around ), shallow, high energy, clear water that was free from debris and which had a normal salinity level of 27 to 40 ppt (parts per thousand). The basin water provided plenty of nutrients, since there was continuous upwelling of water that mixed newly brought marine water with anoxic water from the basin floor. The makeup of the reef is described as being built primarily from erect sponges, which have large, rigid skeletons, and abundant red algae, microbial micrite, and inorganic cement. The microbial micrite worked to trap sediment.

One of the most prominent sponges that made up the Capitan Reef was the sponge family &quot;Guadalupiidae&quot;, a sponge that first appeared on Glass Mountains in the mid Permian and had spread into the Delaware Basin by the late Permian.

There were more environmental changes to mark the second stage of the formation of the Capitan Reef. This period of growth was marked by eustatic changes in global sea levels, due to frequent glaciations. The reef experienced major growth vertically at this stage and grew at a rapid enough pace to keep up with rising sea levels. The Capitan Reef also found a stable foundation on the reef debris and talus that rested on its slopes, and this foundation allowed the reef to grow outward. In some locations, nutrients and minerals were so abundant that the Capitan Reef grew out almost 50 km from the starting point.

===== Reef death during the Late Permian =====
The third stage of the Capitan Reef is the death of the reef system. Ocean currents in the Permian played a huge role in setting up the climate of the region and for aiding in the growth and death of the Capitan Reef. The climate of the basin region was hot and arid, which is shown in the evaporite deposits that can be found in the back reef region.

The end in growth and accumulation of the Permian Reef Complex was influenced by tectonics. During the end of the Permian Period, the supercontinent of Pangaea was beginning its break up, which drastically changed the conditions that were previously favourable for reef growth. Change in tectonics limited the exchange of sea water in the Hovey Channel, which then led to a salinity increase in the Permian Basin. The reef could not survive this drastic change in water salinity, and was therefore destroyed.

Up until the Guadalupian, the Permian Basin had adequate water circulation with fresh water coming in from the Hovey Channel. Evaporite growth along the bottom portions of the basin showed that the water column was most likely stratified and euxinic, meaning the water was both anoxic and sulfidic. The passageways between the Delaware and Midland Basins were restricted due to tectonic changes, and this caused the salinity of the water to rise. The growing temperatures in the late Permian combined with the increase in salinity caused the extinction of the Capitan Reef, as well as the formation of evaporites with the basin.

The layers of evaporites that formed as a result of increased salinity is called the Castile Formation. This formation consists of alternating layers of gypsum/anhydrite and limestone, as well as massive beds of gypsum/anhydrite, salt, and some limestone. The unit measures almost in total and was formed during the Lopingian Epoch. The individual layers (laminae) of gypsum/anhydrite are between and in thickness, which is thought to correlate with the basin salinity on a year by year basis.

The Capitan Reef had been altered diagenetically early on in its history, especially after the deposition of the Castile Formation. There is evidence of fabric alteration throughout this formation, which is thought to indicate the dehydration and rehydration process of the gypsum and anhydrites. There is also evidence of evaporite calcitization. The reef system was buried until it was exposed in the Mesozoic Era as a result of tectonic activity by the Laramide Orogeny. The deep water shale and carbonate reefs of the Delaware and Midland Basins and the Central Basin Platform would become lucrative hydrocarbon reservoirs.

== Generalized facies tracts of the Permian Basin ==

The Permian basin is divided into generalized facies belts differentiated by the depositional environment in which they formed, influenced by sea level, climate, salinity, and access to the sea.

=== Lowstand systems tract ===
Lowering sea level exposes the peritidal and potentially, the shelf margin regions, allowing linear channel sandstones to cut into the shelf, extending beyond the shelf margin atop the slope carbonates, fanning outward toward the basin. The tidal flats during a lowstand contain aeolian sandstones and siltstones atop supratidal of the transgressive systems tract. The basin fill during a lowstand is composed of thin carbonate beds intermingled with sandstone and siltstone at the shelf and sandstone beds within the basin.

=== Transgressive systems tract ===
These facies results from the abrupt deepening of the basin and the reestablishment of carbonate production. Carbonates such as bioturbated wackstone and oxygen poor lime mud accumulate atop the underlying lowstand systems tract sandstones in the basin and on the slope. The tidal flats are characterized by supratidal faces of hot and arid climate such as dolomudstones and dolopackstones. The basin is characterized by thick carbonate beds on or close to the shelf with the shelf margin becoming progressively steeper and the basin sandstones becoming thinner.

=== Highstand systems tract ===
Highstand systems tract facies results from the slowing down in the rise of sea level. It is characterized by carbonate production on the shelf margin and dominant carbonate deposition throughout the basin. The lithofacies is of thick beds of carbonates on the shelf and shelf margin and thin sandstone beds on the slope. The basin becomes restricted by the formation of red beds on the shelf, creating evaporites in the basin.

== Tectonic history ==
During the Cambrian–Mississippian, the ancestral Permian Basin was the broad marine passive margin Tobosa Basin containing deposits of carbonates and clastics. In the early Pennsylvanian–early Permian the collision of North American and Gondwana Land (South America and Africa) caused the Hercynian orogeny. The Hercynian Orogeny resulted in the Tobosa basin being differentiated into two deep basins (the Delaware and the Midland Basins) surrounded by shallow shelves. During the Permian, the basin became structurally stable and filled with clastics in the basin and carbonates on the shelves.

=== Lower Paleozoic passive margin phase (late Precambrian–Mississippian, 850–310 Mya) ===
This passive margin succession is present throughout the southwestern US and is up to thick. The ancestral Permian basin is characterized by weak crustal extension and low subsidence in which the Tobosa basin developed. The Tobosa basin contained shelf carbonates and shales.

=== Collision phase (late Mississippian–Pennsylvanian, 310–265 Mya) ===
The two lobed geometry of the Permian basin separated by a platform was the result of the Hercynian collisional orogeny during the collision of North America and Gondwana Land (South America and Africa). This collision uplifted the Ouachita-Marathon fold belt and deformed the Tobosa Basin. The Delaware Basin resulted from tilting along areas of Proterozoic weakness in Tobosa basin. Southwestern compression reactivated steeply dipping thrust faults and uplifted the Central Basin ridge. Folding of the basement terrane split the basin into the Delaware basin to the west and the Midland Basin to the east.

=== Permian Basin phase (Permian, 265–230 Mya) ===
Rapid sedimentation of clastics, carbonate platforms and shelves, and evaporites proceeded synorogenically. Bursts of orogenic activity are divided by three angular unconformities in basin strata. Evaporite deposits in the small remnant basin mark the final stage of sedimentation as the basin became restricted from the sea during sea level fall.

== Hydrocarbon production and reserves ==

The Permian Basin is the largest petroleum-producing basin in the United States and has produced a cumulative 28.9billion barrels of oil and 75trillion cubic feet of gas. In early 2020, over 4 million barrels of oil a day were being pumped from the basin. Eighty percent of estimated reserves are located at less than depth. Ten percent of the oil recovered from the Permian Basin has come from Pennsylvanian carbonates. The largest reservoirs are within the Central Basin Platform, the Northwestern and Eastern shelves, and within Delaware Basin sandstones. The Primary lithologies of the major hydrocarbon reservoirs are limestone, dolomite, and sandstone due to their high porosities. However, advances in hydrocarbon recovery such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have expanded production into unconventional, tight oil shales such as those found in the Wolfcamp Shale.

=== History of resources ===

In 1917, J.A. Udden, a University of Texas geology professor, speculated that the Marathon Fold, associated with the Marathon Mountains, may extend northward. This fold theory was further elaborated on in 1918 by geologists R.A. Liddle and J.W. Beede. The potential structure was thought to be a potential trap for oil. Based on this Marathon Fold theory, and known oil seeps, test drilling commenced in the eastern Permian Basin. 

Oil reserves in the Permian Basin were first documented by W.H Abrams in Mitchell County, West Texas in 1920. The first commercial well was opened a year later in 1921, in the newly discovered Westbrook Oil Field in Mitchell County, at a depth of . Initially, the Permian Basin was thought to have a bowl-like shape, with geological survey crews unable to study the inside of the basin due to a lack of outcrops. The next few years contained discoveries of multiple oil fields, such as the Big Lake oil field (1923), the World oil field (1925), the McCamey oil field (1925), the Hendrick oil field (1926), and the Yates Oil Field (1926). All of these discoveries were made by random drilling or surfacing mapping. Geophysical tests were vital in mapping the region, since tools such as seismographs and magnetometers were used to find anomalies in the area.

By 1924, companies establishing regional geological offices in the basin included the California Company (Standard Oil of California), Gulf Oil, Humble (Standard Oil of New Jersey), Roxana (Shell Oil Company), Dixie Oil (Standard Oil of Indiana), Midwest Exploration (Standard Oil of Indiana), and The Texas Company.

Due to distances and lack of pipes in which to move oil, deep drilling tests were few in the 1920s, since the costs were high. As a result, all the oil wells up to 1928 were less than or deep. However, in 1928, the No. I-B University discovery well found oil at 8,520 feet within the Ordovician formations of Big Lake. Exploration and development increased in the 1930s with the discovery of the Harper oil field (1933), the Goldsmith oil field (1934), the Foster oil field (1935), the Keystone oil field (1935), the Means oil field (1934), the Wasson oil field (1936–1937), and the Slaughter Field (1936). During World War II the need for oil in the US became urgent, justifying the high costs of deep oil drilling. This breakthrough led to major oil reservoirs being found in every geological formation from the Cambrian Period to the Permian Period. Significant discoveries included the Embrar oil field (1942), the TXL oil field (1944), the Dollarhide oil field (1945), and the Block 31 oil field (1945).

In 1966, the production of the Permian Basin measured 600 million barrels of oil, along with 2.3 trillion cubic ft of gas, which totaled $2 billion. The production values steadily increased thanks to the installation of gas pipelines and oil refineries in the area, reaching a total production of over 14.9 billion barrels in 1993.

In addition to oil, one of the main commodities that is mined from the Permian Basin is potash, which was first discovered in the region in the late 1800s by geologist Johan August Udden. Early studies by Udden, and the presence of potash in the Santa Rita well between 1100 and 1700 feet, led to the United States Geological Survey exploring the area in search of potash, which was highly important during World War I as the US could no longer import it from Germany. By the mid 1960s, seven potash mines were operating on the New Mexico side of the Permian Basin.

=== Current production ===
, the Permian Basin has produced more than 33 billion barrels of oil, along with 118 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. This production accounts for 20% of US crude oil production and 7% of US dry natural gas production. While the production was thought to have peaked in the early 1970s, new technologies for oil extraction, such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, have increased production dramatically. Estimates from the Energy Information Administration have predicted that proven reserves in the Permian Basin still hold 5 billion barrels of oil and approximately 19 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

=== Environmental Concerns ===
By October 2019, the fossil-fuel executives said that until recently they had been making progress in cutting back on flaring, which is to burn natural gas. Drilling companies focus on drilling and pumping oil, which is highly lucrative but the less-valuable gas which is pumped along with the oil, is considered to be a &quot;byproduct&quot;. During the current boom in the Permian oil fields, drilling for oil has &quot;far outpaced pipeline construction&quot; so the use of flaring has increased along with venting &quot;natural gas and other potent greenhouse gases directly into the atmosphere&quot;, causing considerably larger greenhouse effect than flaring. Both practices are legal under states&#x27; legislation. Most of the methane emitted comes from a small number of sources. Satellite data show that 3.7% of gas produced from the Permian Basin is lost in leaks, equivalent to the consumption of 7 million Texas homes. The price of natural gas was so cheap that smaller companies that have the pipeline capacity are choosing to flare rather than pay pipeline costs.

<doc id="242753" wikidata="Q212338" url="?curid=242753" title="Philolaus">
<text>Philolaus (; , &quot;Philólaos&quot;; )
was a Greek Pythagorean and pre-Socratic philosopher. He was born in a Greek colony in Italy and migrated to Greece. Philolaus has been called one of three most prominent figures in the Pythagorean tradition and the most outstanding figure in the Pythagorean school. Pythagoras developed a school of philosophy that was dominated by both mathematics and mysticism. Most of what is known today about the Pythagorean astronomical system is derived from Philolaus&#x27;s views. He may have been the first to write about Pythagorean doctrine. According to , who cites Nicomachus, Philolaus was the successor of Pythagoras.

He argued that at the foundation of everything is the part played by the limiting and limitless, which combine in a harmony. With his assertions that the Earth was not the center of the universe (geocentrism), he is credited with the earliest known discussion of concepts in the development of heliocentrism, the theory that the Earth is not the center of the Universe, but rather that the Sun is. Philolaus discussed a Central Fire as the center of the universe and that spheres (including the Sun) revolved around it.

==Biography==
Various reports give the birthplace of Philolaus as either Croton, Tarentum, or Metapontum—all part of Magna Graecia (the name of the coastal areas of Southern Italy on the Tarentine Gulf that were colonized extensively by Greek settlers). It is most likely that he came from Croton. He migrated to Greece, perhaps while fleeing the second burning of the Pythagorean meeting-place around 454 BC.

According to Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot;, he was the instructor of Simmias and Cebes at Thebes, around the time the &quot;Phaedo&quot; takes place, in 399 BC. That would make him a contemporary of Socrates, and would agree with the statement that Philolaus and Democritus were contemporaries.

The writings of much later writers are the sources of further reports about his life. They are scattered and of dubious value in reconstructing his life. Apparently, he lived for some time at Heraclea, where he was the pupil of Aresas, or (as Plutarch calls him) Arcesus. Diogenes Laërtius is the only authority for the claim that shortly after the death of Socrates, Plato traveled to Italy where he met with Philolaus and Eurytus. The pupils of Philolaus were said to have included Xenophilus, Phanto, Echecrates, Diocles, and Polymnastus.

As to his death, Diogenes Laërtius reports a dubious story that Philolaus was put to death at Croton on account of being suspected of wanting to be the tyrant;
a story which Diogenes Laërtius even chose to put into verse.

==Writings==

Pythagoras and his earliest successors do not appear to have committed any of their doctrines to writing. According to Porphyrius (Vit. Pyth. p. 40) Lysis and Archippus collected in a written form some of the principal Pythagorean doctrines, which were handed down as heirlooms in their families, under strict injunctions that they should not be made public. But amid the different and inconsistent accounts of the matter, the first publication of the Pythagorean doctrines is pretty uniformly attributed to Philolaus.

In one source, Diogenes Laërtius speaks of Philolaus composing one book, but elsewhere he speaks of three books, as do Aulus Gellius and Iamblichus. It might have been one treatise divided into three books. Plato is said to have procured a copy of his book. Later, it was claimed that Plato composed much of his &quot;Timaeus&quot; based upon the book by Philolaus.

One of the works of Philolaus was called &quot;On Nature&quot;. It seems to be the same work that Stobaeus calls &quot;On the World&quot; and from which he has preserved a series of passages. Other writers refer to a work entitled &quot;Bacchae&quot;, which may have been another name for the same work, and which may originate from Arignote. However, it has been mentioned that Proclus describes the &quot;Bacchae&quot; as a book for teaching theology by means of mathematics. It appears, in fact, from this, as well as from the extant fragments, that the first book of the work contained a general account of the origin and arrangement of the universe. The second book appears to have been an exposition of the nature of numbers, which in the Pythagorean theory are the essence and source of all things.

He composed a work on the Pythagorean philosophy in three books, which Plato is said to have procured at the cost of 100 minae through Dion of Syracuse, who purchased it from Philolaus, who was at the time in deep poverty. Other versions of the story represent Plato as purchasing it himself from Philolaus or his relatives when in Sicily. Out of the materials which he derived from these books Plato is said to have composed his &quot;Timaeus&quot;. But in the age of Plato the leading features of the Pythagorean doctrines had long ceased to be a secret; and if Philolaus taught the Pythagorean doctrines at Thebes, he was hardly likely to feel much reluctance in publishing them; and amid the conflicting and improbable accounts preserved in the authorities above referred to, little more can be regarded as trustworthy, except that Philolaus was the first who published a book on the Pythagorean doctrines, and that Plato read and made use of it.
Historians from the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, Chapter &quot;Philolaus&#x27; Book: Genuine Fragments and Testimonia&quot;, noted the following:
==Philosophy==
Philolaus argued at the foundation of everything is the part played by the ideas of limit and the unlimited. One of the first declarations in the work of Philolaus was that all things in the universe result from a combination of the unlimited and the limiting; for if all things had been unlimited, nothing could have been the object of knowledge. Limiters and unlimiteds are combined in a harmony (&quot;harmonia&quot;):
Robert Scoon explained Philolaus&#x27; universe in 1922:
The book by Philolaus begins with the following:
According to Stobaeus, Philolaus did away with the ideas of fixed direction in space and developed one of the first non-geocentric views of the universe and in his new way of thinking, the universe revolved around a hypothetical astronomical object he called the Central Fire.

In Philolaus&#x27;s system a sphere of the fixed stars, the five planets, the Sun, Moon, and Earth, all moved around a Central Fire. According to Aristotle, writing in &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, Philolaus added a tenth unseen body, he called Counter-Earth, as without it there would be only nine revolving bodies, and the Pythagorean number theory required a tenth. However, Greek scholar George Burch asserts his belief that Aristotle was lampooning Philolaus&#x27;s addition.

The system that Philolaus described predated the idea of spheres by hundreds of years, however. Nearly two-thousand years later, Nicolaus Copernicus would mention in &quot;De revolutionibus&quot; that Philolaus already knew about the Earth&#x27;s revolution around a central fire.

It has been pointed out, however, that Stobaeus betrays a tendency to confound the dogmas of the early Ionian philosophers, and in his accounts, he occasionally mixes up Platonism with Pythagoreanism.

<doc id="242758" wikidata="Q3373961" url="?curid=242758" title="Snarl">
<text>A snarl is a sound, often a growl or vicious utterance, often accompanied by a facial expression, where the upper lip is raised, and the nostrils widen, generally indicating hate, anger or pain. In addition to humans, other mammals including monkeys, rabbits and dogs snarl, often to warn others of their potential bite. In humans, snarling uses the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle. The threatening vocalizations of snarling are often accompanied by or used synonymously with threatening facial expressions.

The word &quot;snarl&quot; is also used as an onomatopoeia for the threatening noise to which it refers, as in the &#x27;snarl&#x27; of a chainsaw. This usage may derive from the common expression describing a dog as &quot;growling and snarling&quot;. One literary use of &quot;snarl&quot; to mean a noise is in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in the encounter with the barrow-wight: &quot;In the dark there was a snarling noise&quot;.

<text>Facial expression is the motion and positioning of the muscles beneath the skin of the face. These movements convey the emotional state of an individual to observers and are a form of nonverbal communication. They are a primary means of conveying social information between humans, but they also occur in most other mammals and some other animal species.

Humans can adopt a facial expression voluntarily or involuntarily, and the neural mechanisms responsible for controlling the expression differ in each case. Voluntary facial expressions are often socially conditioned and follow a cortical route in the brain. Conversely, involuntary facial expressions are believed to be innate and follow a subcortical route in the brain. Facial recognition can be an emotional experience for the brain and the amygdala is highly involved in the recognition process.

Beyond the accessory nature of facial expressions in spoken communication between people, they play a significant role in communication with sign language. Many phrases in sign language include facial expressions.

There is controversy surrounding the question of whether facial expressions are a worldwide and universal display among humans.

== Creation ==

=== Facial muscles ===

Facial expressions are vital to social communication between humans. They are caused by the movement of muscles that connect to the skin and fascia in the face. These muscles move the skin, creating lines and folds and causing the movement of facial features, such as the mouth and eyebrows. These muscles develop from the second pharyngeal arch in the embryo. The temporalis, masseter, and internal and external pterygoid muscles, which are mainly used for chewing, have a minor effect on expression as well. These muscles develop from the first pharyngeal arch.

=== Neuronal pathways ===
There are two brain pathways associated with facial expression; the first is voluntary expression. Voluntary expression travels from the primary motor cortex through the pyramidal tract, specifically the corticobulbar projections. The cortex is associated with display rules in emotion, which are social precepts that influence and modify expressions. Cortically related expressions are made consciously.

The second type of expression is emotional. These expressions originate from the extrapyramidal motor system, which involves subcortical nuclei. For this reason, genuine emotions are not associated with the cortex and are often displayed unconsciously. This is demonstrated in infants before the age of two; they display distress, disgust, interest, anger, contempt, surprise, and fear. Infants&#x27; displays of these emotions indicate that they are not cortically related. Similarly, blind children also display emotions, proving that they are subconscious rather than learned. Other subcortical facial expressions include the &quot;knit brow&quot; during concentration, raised eyebrows when listening attentively, and short &quot;punctuation&quot; expressions to add emphasis during speech. People can be unaware that they are producing these expressions.

=== Asymmetries ===
The lower portions of the face are controlled by the opposite cerebral hemisphere, causing asymmetric facial expression. Because the right hemisphere is more specialised for emotional expression, emotions are more strongly expressed on the left side of the face, particularly for negative emotions. Asymmetries in expression can be seen in chimeric faces (facial portraits made by combining the left and right halves of faces with different expressions) and also in portraits which more often show the left, more emotional side of the face than the right.

== Neural mechanisms in face perception ==

The amygdala plays an important role in facial recognition. Functional imaging studies have found that when shown pictures of faces, there is a large increase in the activity of the amygdala. The amygdala receives visual information from the thalamus via the subcortical pathways. The amygdala may also have a significant role in the recognition of fear and negative emotions. It is believed that the emotion disgust is recognized through activation of the insula and basal ganglia. The recognition of emotion may also utilize the occipitotemporal neocortex, orbitofrontal cortex and right frontoparietal cortices.

=== Gender and facial cues ===
More than anything though, what shapes a child&#x27;s cognitive ability to detect facial expression is being exposed to it from the time of birth. The more an infant is exposed to different faces and expressions, the more able they are to recognize these emotions and then mimic them for themselves. Infants are exposed to an array of emotional expressions from birth, and evidence indicates that they imitate some facial expressions and gestures (e.g., tongue protrusion) as early as the first few days of life. In addition, gender affects the tendency to express, perceive, remember, and forget specific emotions. For instance, angry male faces and happy female faces are more recognizable, compared to happy male faces and angry female faces.

== Communication ==
A 2020 study on &quot;emotion residue&quot; found that even when study participants attempted to make neutral facial expressions, their faces still retained emotion residue from prior expressions, and these prior expressions were able to be detected by observers.

A 1988 study on the “facial feedback” hypothesis found that study participants mood was improved when they smiled. However, this study later failed a large replication attempt.

One experiment investigated the influence of gaze direction and facial expression on face memory. Participants were shown a set of unfamiliar faces with either happy or angry facial expressions, which were either gazing straight ahead or had their gaze averted to one side. Memory for faces that were initially shown with angry expressions was found to be poorer when these faces had averted as opposed to direct gaze, whereas memory for individuals shown with happy faces was unaffected by gaze direction. It is suggested that memory for another individual&#x27;s face partly depends on an evaluation of the behavioural intention of that individual.

A 2025 study from Nottingham Trent University in England found that people who were facially expressive were more liked by social partners, which may be one reason why people produce, on average, 101 facial movements per minute during a given social interaction.

=== Eye contact ===

A person&#x27;s face, especially their eyes, creates the most obvious and immediate cues that lead to the formation of impressions. This article discusses eyes and facial expressions and the effect they have on interpersonal communication.

A person&#x27;s eyes reveal much about how they are feeling, or what they are thinking. Blink rate can reveal how nervous or at ease a person may be. Research by Boston College professor Joe Tecce suggests that stress levels are revealed by blink rates. He supports his data with statistics on the relation between the blink rates of presidential candidates and their success in their races. Tecce claims that the faster blinker in the presidential debates has lost every election since 1980. Though Tecce&#x27;s data is interesting, it is important to recognize that non-verbal communication is multi-channeled, and focusing on only one aspect is reckless. Nervousness can also be measured by examining each candidates&#x27; perspiration, eye contact and stiffness.

Within their first year, Infants learn rapidly that the looking behaviors of others convey significant information. Infants prefer to look at faces that engage them in mutual gaze and that, from an early age, healthy babies show enhanced neural processing of direct gaze.

Eye contact is another major aspect of facial communication. Some have hypothesized that this is due to infancy, as humans are one of the few mammals who maintain regular eye contact with their mother while nursing. Eye contact serves a variety of purposes. It regulates conversations, shows interest or involvement, and establishes a connection with others.

But different cultures have different rules for eye contact. Certain Asian cultures can perceive direct eye contact as a way to signal competitiveness, which in many situations may prove to be inappropriate. Others lower their eyes to signal respect, and similarly, eye contact is avoided in Nigeria; however, in western cultures this could be misinterpreted as lacking self-confidence.

Even beyond the idea of eye contact, eyes communicate more data than a person even consciously expresses. Pupil dilation is a significant cue to a level of excitement, pleasure, or attraction. Dilated pupils indicate greater affection or attraction, while constricted pupils send a colder signal.

=== Sign languages ===
Facial expression is used in sign languages to convey specific meanings. In American Sign Language (ASL), for instance, raised eyebrows combined with a slightly forward head tilt to indicate that what is being signed is a yes–no question. Lowered eyebrows are used for wh-word questions. Facial expression is also used in sign languages to show adverbs and adjectives such as distance or size: an open mouth, squinted eyes and tilted back head indicate something far while the mouth pulled to one side and the cheek held toward the shoulder indicate something close, and puffed cheeks mean very large. It can also show the manner in which something is done, such as carelessly or routinely. Some of these expressions, also called non-manual signs, are used similarly in different sign languages while others are different from one language to another. For example, the expression used for &#x27;carelessly&#x27; in ASL means &#x27;boring or unpleasant&#x27; in British Sign Language.

== Universality hypothesis ==

The universality hypothesis is the assumption that certain facial expressions and face-related acts or events are signals of specific emotions (happiness with laughter and smiling, sadness with tears, anger with a clenched jaw, fear with a grimace, or gurn, surprise with raised eyebrows and wide eyes along with a slight retraction of the ears, and disgust with a wrinkled nose and squinted eyes—emotions which frequently lack the social component of those like shame, pride, jealousy, envy, deference, etc.) and are recognized by people regardless of culture, language, or time. The belief in the evolutionary basis of these kinds of facial expressions can be traced back to Darwin&#x27;s &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals.&quot; Reviews of the universality hypothesis have been both supportive and critical. Work in 2013 by Nelson and Russell and Jack et al. has been especially critical.

=== Support ===
Ekman&#x27;s work on facial expressions had its starting point in the work of psychologist Silvan Tomkins. Ekman showed that facial expressions of emotion are not culturally determined, but universal across human cultures.

To demonstrate his universality hypothesis, Ekman ran a test on a group of the South Fore people of New Guinea, a pre-industrial culture that was isolated from the West. The experiment participants were told brief stories about emotional events (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust). After each story, they were asked to select the matching facial expression from an array of three faces. The Fore selected the &quot;correct face&quot; on 64–90% of trials but had difficulty distinguishing the fear face from the surprise face. Children selected from an array of only two faces, and their results were similar to the adults&#x27;. Subsequent cross-cultural studies found similar results

=== Criticism ===

Both sides of this debate agree that the face expresses emotion. The controversy surrounds the uncertainty about what specific emotional information is read from a facial expression. Opponents of the universality hypothesis believe that more general information is pieced together with other contextual information in order to determine how a person feels.

One argument against the evidence presented in support of the universality hypothesis is that the method typically used to demonstrate universality inflates recognition scores. Although each factor may contribute only a small amount to the inflation, combined, they can produce exaggerated scores. The three main factors are the following:
* The universality hypothesis focuses on people&#x27;s abilities to recognize spontaneous facial expressions as they occur naturally. However, the facial expressions used to test this hypothesis are posed. Studies of spontaneous facial expressions are rare and find that participants&#x27; recognition of the expressions is lower than that of the corresponding posed expressions.
* In most studies, participants are shown more than one facial expression (Ekman recommends six of each expression). However, people judge facial expressions relative to others that they have seen, and participants who judge more than one facial expression have higher recognition rates than those who judge only one.
* The response format that is most commonly used in emotion recognition studies is forced choice. In forced choice, for each facial expression, participants are asked to select their response from a short list of emotion labels. The forced choice method determines the emotion attributed to the facial expressions via the labels that are presented. That is, participants will select the best match to the facial expression even if it is not the emotion label they would have provided spontaneously and even if they would not have labeled the expression as an emotion at all.

=== Evolutionary significance of universality ===
Darwin argued that the expression of emotions has evolved in humans from animal ancestors, who would have used similar methods of expression. Darwin believed that expressions were unlearned and innate in human nature and were therefore evolutionarily significant for survival. He compiled supporting evidence from his research on different cultures, on infants, and in other animal species. Ekman found that people from different cultures recognized certain facial expressions despite vast cultural differences, and his findings tended to confirm Darwin&#x27;s initial hypothesis.

Cross-cultural studies had shown that there are similarities in the way emotions are expressed across diverse cultures, but studies have even shown that there are similarities between species in how emotions are expressed. Research has shown that chimpanzees are able to communicate many of the same facial expressions as humans through the complex movements of the facial muscles. In fact, the facial cues were so similar that Ekman&#x27;s Facial Action Coding System could be applied to the chimps in evaluating their expressions. Of course, differences between the species&#x27; physical facial properties, such as white sclera and everted lips in chimps, would mean that some expressions could not be compared.

Similarly, Darwin observed that infants&#x27; method of expression for certain emotions was instinctive, as they were able to display emotional expressions they had not themselves yet witnessed. Facial morphology impacts expression recognition in important ways, and therefore, infant facial morphology may also serve some specific communicative function. These similarities in morphology and movement are important for the correct interpretation of an emotion.

Darwin was particularly interested in the functions of facial expression as evolutionarily important for survival. He looked at the functions of facial expression in terms of the utility of expression in the life of the animal and in terms of specific expressions within species. Darwin deduced that some animals communicated feelings of different emotional states with specific facial expressions. He further concluded that this communication was important for the survival of animals in group-dwelling species; the skill to effectively communicate or interpret another animal&#x27;s feelings and behaviors would be a principal trait in naturally fit species. However, this suggests that solitary species such as orangutans would not exhibit such expressions.

For a discussion of the controversies on these claims, see Fridlund and Russell &amp; Fernandez Dols.

<doc id="242763" wikidata="Q637371" url="?curid=242763" title="Anacrusis">
<text>In poetic and musical meter, and by analogy in publishing, an anacrusis (from , , literally: &#x27;pushing up&#x27;, plural &quot;anacruses&quot;) is a brief introduction. In music, it is also known as a pickup beat, or fractional pick-up, i.e. a note or sequence of notes, a motif, which precedes the first downbeat in a bar in a musical phrase.

It is a set of syllables or notes, or a single syllable or note, which precedes what is considered the first foot of a poetic line (or the first syllable of the first foot) in poetry and the first beat (or the first beat of the first measure) in music that is not its own phrase, section, or line and is not considered part of the line, phrase, or section which came before, if any.

== Poetry ==
In poetry, a set of extrametrical syllables at the beginning of a verse is said to stand in anacrusis ( &quot;pushing up&quot;). &quot;An extrametrical prelude to the verse,&quot; or, &quot;extrametrical unstressed syllables preceding the initial lift.&quot; The technique is seen in Old English poetry, and in lines of iambic pentameter, the technique applies a variation on the typical pentameter line causing it to appear at first glance as trochaic. Below, the anacrusis in the fourth line of William Blake&#x27;s poem &quot;The Tyger&quot; (with punctuation modernized) is in italics:

The poem is in trochaic tetrameter, in which the first syllable of each line is expected to be stressed, but the fourth line begins with the additional unstressed syllable &quot;Could&quot;.

== Music ==
In music, an anacrusis (also known as a pickup, or fractional pick-up) is a note or sequence of notes, a motif, which precedes the first downbeat in a bar in a musical phrase. &quot;The span from the beginning of a group to the strongest beat in the group.&quot; Anacrusis, especially reoccurring anacrusis (anacrusis motif played before every measure or every other measure), &quot;is a common means of weighting the first beat,&quot; and thus strengthening or articulating the meter.

The term is borrowed from the terminology of poetry. Anacruses may involve fine details such as rhythm and phrasing or may involve wider features such as musical form (such as when used repeatedly).

The anacrusis is a perceived grouping which is context generated in the individual phrasing of a concrete composition. The grouping of one or more antecedent tone events to a perceived phrase gestalt may be rhythmically evoked by their temporal proximity to the phrase&#x27;s first downbeat (perceived phrase onset).

Although the anacrusis is integrated in a musical phrase gestalt (grouped to it), it is not located in the perceived &#x27;body&#x27; of the phrase (which is spanning from its first downbeat to its ending beat) but before the phrase (hence the German term &quot;Auftakt&quot;; literally: &quot;upbeat&quot;). In this respect – in a sequence of phrases – the anacrusis also may be perceived &#x27;between&#x27; two phrases, neither being perceived as part of the ending of a former one, nor being located in the following one.

Outside of that the term of the anacrusis is most commonly used where it applies everywhere else &#x27;within&#x27; the &#x27;body&#x27; of the phrase between the &#x27;head&#x27; (first downbeat) and the &#x27;foot&#x27; (ending beat) where, by what ever musical means, a grouping is perceived from an upbeat to a downbeat (especially also to the phrases ending beat).

Since an anacrusis &quot;is an incomplete measure that allows the composition [or section or phrase] to start on a beat other than one,&quot; if an anacrusis is present, the first bar after the anacrusis is assigned bar number 1, and Western standards for musical notation often include the recommendation that when a piece of music begins with an anacrusis, the notation should omit a corresponding number of beats from the final bar of the piece, or the final bar before a repeat sign, in order to keep the length of the entire piece at a whole number of bars. This final partial measure is the complement. However, an anacrusis may last an entire bar.

===Examples===

* In the song &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot;, &quot;Happy&quot; is the anacrusis and the accent is on the first syllable of &quot;Birthday&quot;.
* In &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, the word &quot;O!&quot; in the first line is an anacrusis in the music:
* At the beginning of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, &quot;In the&quot; is the anacrusis, while &quot;town&quot; falls on the downbeat.

== Other fields ==

In academic publishing, the term is sometimes used in an article to mark an introductory idea standing between the abstract and the introduction proper.

<text>Sergei Duvanov (born 1953) is a prominent Kazakhstani journalist who, in 2002, wrote articles that claimed President Nursultan Nazarbayev and several other Kazakh politicians had illicit Swiss bank accounts containing millions of U.S.&#x27; dollars. The scandal was labeled &quot;Kazakhgate&quot;.

==Controversy==
In 2001, the U.S. Department of Justice investigated Kazakhgate. Duvanov was arrested in October 2002 at his datcha outside Almaty and accused of raping a 14-year-old girl. The arrest occurred one day before he visited the United States to speak about Kazakhstan&#x27;s human rights situation. In January, 2003 he was found guilty and sentenced to three and a half years in prison. The International League for Human Rights (ILHR), a New York-based human rights watchdog, condemned the Kazakhstani government&#x27;s persecution of Sergei Duvanov. On the initiative of its Central Asia Project Manager Peter Zalmayev, ILHR awarded Duvanov (in absentia) its annual human rights award at a ceremony held at the United Nations on December 9, 2002. As of 15 January 2004, he is under a prison regime which allows him to go to work and live at home. However, Duvanov is not allowed to go to public places (a notion undetermined by Kazakh law). Duvanov, and the opposition, claim that the case was politically motivated. On January 15, 2004, Duvanov was released on probation.

<text>BVD is a brand of men&#x27;s underwear, which are commonly referred to as &quot;BVDs&quot;. The brand was founded in 1876 and named after the three founders of the New York City firm: (Joseph W.) Bradley, (Luther C.) Voorhees, and (Lyman H.) Day (thus &quot;B.V.D.&quot;). The BVD brand, originally produced for men and women, in the United States is now produced solely for men by Fruit of the Loom. The BVD brand is also sold in Japan.

== History ==

BVD first manufactured bustles for women. They then became famous for their men&#x27;s union suits made of heavy knitted fabric. In 1908, that bulky and tight-fitting garment was turned into a new kind of loose-fitting underwear. They went on to introduce a two-piece and the popular union suit as well as a lightweight waffle-like fabric with the advertising slogan, &quot;Next to Myself I Like BVD Best&quot;.

At the beginning of the 1930s, BVD was purchased by the Atlas Underwear company of Piqua, Ohio. During the Great Depression, they were successful in manufacturing swimsuits for men, women and children. They patented their own fabric, Sea Satin, a rayon woven satin backed with latex for stretch. They also used knits of cotton, wool and rayon, and cellophane. Their swimsuits featured in major fashion magazines and high-fashion stores. Styles included form-fitting maillots as well as full-skirted swimsuits. They offered suits for men with detachable tops. In 1929, Olympic swimmer Johnny Weissmuller, who went on to become the most famous Tarzan in motion pictures, was hired as a model and representative. He was featured at swim shows throughout the country wearing the BVD brand of swimsuits, handing out leaflets and giving autographs.

In 1951, the brand was purchased by Superior Mills. BVD was first to start packaging underwear in plastic bags for the mass market. In the 1960s and 1970s, they started introducing sportops, a pocket T-shirt, and fashionable underwear made of nylon. In 1976, BVD was purchased by Fruit of the Loom. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1999 and was purchased by Berkshire Hathaway in 2001.

<doc id="242778" wikidata="Q783770" url="?curid=242778" title="Agriculture in the United States">
<text>Agriculture is a major industry in the United States, which is a net exporter of food. As of the 2017 census of agriculture, there were 2.04 million farms, covering an area of , an average of per farm.

Agriculture in the United States is highly mechanized, with an average of only one farmer or farm laborer required per square kilometer of farmland for agricultural production.

Although agricultural activity occurs in every U.S. state, it is particularly concentrated in the Central Valley of California and in the Great Plains, a vast expanse of flat arable land in the center of the nation, in the region west of the Great Lakes and east of the Rocky Mountains. The eastern wetter half is a major corn and soybean-producing region known as the Corn Belt, and the western drier half is known as the Wheat Belt because of its high rate of wheat production. The Central Valley of California produces fruits, vegetables, and nuts. The American South has historically been a large producer of cotton, tobacco, and rice, but it has declined in agricultural production over the past century. Florida leads the nation in citrus production and is the number two producer of oranges in the world behind only Brazil.

The U.S. has led developments in seed improvement, such as hybridization, and in expanding uses for crops from the work of George Washington Carver to bioplastics and biofuels. The mechanization of farming and intensive farming have been major themes in U.S. history, including John Deere&#x27;s steel plow, Cyrus McCormick&#x27;s mechanical reaper, Eli Whitney&#x27;s cotton gin, and the widespread success of the Fordson tractor and the combine harvester. Modern agriculture in the U.S. ranges from hobby farms and small-scale producers to large commercial farms that cover thousands of acres of cropland or rangeland.

==History==
Corn, turkeys, tomatoes, potatoes, peanuts, and sunflower seeds constitute some of the major holdovers from the agricultural endowment of the Americas.

Colonists had more access to land in the colonial United States than they did in Europe. The organization of labor was complex including free persons, slaves and indentured servants depending on the regions where either slaves or poor landless laborers were available to work on family farms.

European agricultural practices greatly affected the New England landscape. Colonists brought livestock over from Europe which caused many changes to the land. Grazing animals required a lot of land and food and the act of grazing itself destroyed native grasses, which were being replaced by European species. New species of weeds were introduced and began to thrive as they were capable of withstanding the grazing of animals, whereas native species could not.

The practices associated with keeping livestock also contributed to the deterioration of the forests and fields. Colonists would cut down the trees and then allow their cattle and livestock to graze freely in the forest and never plant more trees. The animals trampled and tore up the ground so much as to cause long-term destruction and damage.

Soil exhaustion was a huge problem in New England agriculture. Farming with oxen did allow the colonist to farm more land but it increased erosion and decreased soil fertility. This was due to deeper plow cuts in the soil that allowed the soil more contact with oxygen causing nutrient depletion. In grazing fields in New England, the soil was being compacted by the large number of cattle and this did not give the soil enough oxygen to sustain life.

In the United States, farms spread from the colonies westward along with the settlers. In cooler regions, wheat was often the crop of choice when lands were newly settled, leading to a &quot;wheat frontier&quot; that moved westward over the course of years. Also very common in the antebellum Midwest was farming corn while raising hogs, complementing each other especially since it was difficult to get grain to market before the canals and railroads. After the &quot;wheat frontier&quot; had passed through an area, more diversified farms including dairy cattle generally took its place. Warmer regions saw plantings of cotton and herds of beef cattle. In the early colonial South, raising tobacco and cotton was common, especially through the use of slave labor until the Civil War. With an established source for labor, and the development of the cotton gin in 1793, the South was able to maintain an economy based on the production of cotton. By the late 1850s, the South produced one-hundred percent of the 374 million pounds of cotton used in the United States. The rapid growth in cotton production was possible because of the availability of slaves. In the northeast, slaves were used in agriculture until the early 19th century. In the Midwest, slavery was prohibited by the Freedom Ordinance of 1787.

The introduction and broad adoption of scientific agriculture since the mid-19th century contributed to economic growth in the United States. This development was facilitated by the Morrill Act and the Hatch Act of 1887 which established in each state a land-grant university (with a mission to teach and study agriculture) and a federally funded system of agricultural experiment stations and cooperative extension networks which place extension agents in each state.

Soybeans were not widely cultivated in the United States until the early 1930s, and by 1942 it became the world&#x27;s largest soybean producer, due in part to World War II and the &quot;need for domestic sources of fats, oils, and meal&quot;. Between 1930 and 1942, the United States&#x27; share of world soybean production grew from 3% to 47%, and by 1969 it had risen to 76%. By 1973 soybeans were the United States&#x27; &quot;number one cash crop, and leading export commodity, ahead of both wheat and corn&quot;. Although soybeans developed as the top cash crop, corn also remains as an important commodity. As the basis for &quot;industrial food,&quot; corn is found in most modern day items at the grocery store. Aside from items like candy and soda, which contain high fructose corn-syrup, corn is also found in non-edible items like the shining wax on store advertisements.

Significant areas of farmland were abandoned during the Great Depression and incorporated into nascent national forests. Later, &quot;Sodbuster&quot; and &quot;Swampbuster&quot; restrictions written into federal farm programs starting in the 1970s reversed a decades-long trend of habitat destruction that began in 1942 when farmers were encouraged to plant all possible land in support of the war effort. In the United States, federal programs administered through local Soil and Water Conservation Districts provide technical assistance and partial funding to farmers who wish to implement management practices to conserve soil and limit erosion and floods.

Farmers in the early United States were open to planting new crops, raising new animals and adopting new innovations as increased agricultural productivity in turn increased the demand for shipping services, containers, credit, storage, and the like.

Although four million farms disappeared in the United States between 1948 and 2015, total output from the farms that remained more than doubled. The number of farms with more than almost doubled between 1987 and 2012, while the number of farms with to fell over the same period by 44%.

Farm productivity increased in the United States from the mid-20th century until the late-20th century when productivity began to stall.

From 1986 to 2018 about 30 million acres of cropland were abandoned.

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, such as melon (872), pumpkin (683), grapefruit (558), cranberry (404), cherry (312), blueberry (255), rye (214), olive (138), and others.

==Major agricultural products==

Tonnes of United States agriculture production, as reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the U.N. in 2003 and 2013 (ranked roughly in order of value):

Other crops appearing in the top 20 at some point in the last 40 years were: tobacco, barley, and oats, and, rarely: peanuts, almonds, and sunflower seeds. Alfalfa and hay would both be in the top ten in 2003 if they were tracked by FAO.

===Crops===

====Value of production====


Note alfalfa and hay are not tracked by the FAO and the production of tobacco in the United States has fallen 60% between 1997 and 2003.

====Yield====
Heavily mechanized, U.S. agriculture has a high yield relative to other countries. As of 2004:
* Corn for grain, average of 160.4 bushels harvested per acre (10.07 t/ha)
* Soybean for beans, average of 42.5 bushels harvested per acre (2.86 t/ha)
* Wheat, average of 43.2 bushels harvested per acre (2.91 t/ha, was 44.2 bu/ac or 2.97 t/ha in 2003)

===Livestock===

The major livestock industries in the United States:
* Dairy cattle
* Beef cattle
* Pig
* Poultry
* Seafood
* Sheep

Goats, horses, turkeys and bees are also raised, though in lesser quantities. Inventory data is not as readily available as for the major industries. For the three major goat-producing states—Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas—there were 1.2 million goats at the end of 2002. There were 5.3 million horses in the United States at the end of 1998. There were 2.5 million colonies of bees at the end of 2005.

==Farm type or majority enterprise type==
Farm type is based on which commodities are the majority crops grown on a farm. Nine common types include:
* Cash grains includes corn, soybeans and other grains (wheat, oats, barley, sorghum), dry edible beans, peas, and rice.
* Tobacco
* Cotton
* Other field crops includes peanuts, potatoes, sunflowers, sweet potatoes, sugarcane, broomcorn, popcorn, sugar beets, mint, hops, seed crops, hay, silage, forage, etc. Tobacco and cotton can be included here if not in their own separate category.
* High-value crops includes fruits, vegetables, melons, tree nuts, greenhouse, nursery crops, and horticultural specialties.
* Cattle
* Hogs
* Dairy
* Poultry and eggs

One characteristic of the agricultural industry that sets it apart from others is the number of individuals who are self-employed. Frequently, farmers and ranchers are both the principal operator, the individual responsible for successful management and day-to-day decisions, and the primary laborer for his or her operation. For agricultural workers that sustain an injury, the resultant loss of work has implications on physical health and financial stability.

The United States has over 14,000 certified organic farms, covering more than 5 million acres, though this is less than 1% of total US farmland. The output of these farms has grown substantially since 2011, and exceeded US$7.5 billion in 2016.

==Governance==

Agriculture in the United States is primarily governed by periodically renewed U.S. farm bills. Governance is both a federal and a local responsibility with the United States Department of Agriculture being the federal department responsible. Government aid includes research into crop types and regional suitability as well as many kinds of federal government subsidies, price supports and loan programs. U.S. farmers are not subject to production quotas and some laws are different for farms compared to other workplaces.

Labor laws prohibiting children in other workplaces provide some exemptions for children working on farms with complete exemptions for children working on their family&#x27;s farm. Children can also gain permits from vocational training schools or 4-H clubs which allow them to do jobs they would otherwise not be permitted to do.

A large part of the U.S. farm workforce is made up of migrant and seasonal workers, many of them recent immigrants from Latin America. Additional laws apply to these workers and their housing which is often provided by the farmer.

==Occupational safety and health==

Agriculture ranks among the most hazardous industries due to the use of chemicals and risk of injury. Farmers are at high risk for fatal and nonfatal injuries (general traumatic injury and musculoskeletal injury), work-related lung diseases, noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, chemical-related illnesses, and certain cancers associated with chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. In an average year, 516 workers die doing farm work in the U.S. (1992–2005). Every day, about 243 agricultural workers suffer lost-work-time injuries, and about 5% of these result in permanent impairment. Tractor overturns are the leading cause of agriculture-related fatal injuries, and account for over 90 deaths every year. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends the use of roll over protection structures on tractors to reduce the risk of overturn-related fatal injuries.

Farming is one of the few industries in which families (who often share the work and live on the premises) are also at risk for injuries, illness, and death. Agriculture is the most dangerous industry for young workers, accounting for 42% of all work-related fatalities of young workers in the U.S. between 1992 and 2000. In 2011, 108 youth, less than 20 years of age, died from farm-related injuries. Unlike other industries, half the young victims in agriculture were under age 15. For young agricultural workers aged 15–17, the risk of fatal injury is four times the risk for young workers in other workplaces Agricultural work exposes young workers to safety hazards such as machinery, confined spaces, work at elevations, and work around livestock. The most common causes of fatal farm-related youth injuries involve machinery, motor vehicles, or drowning. Together these three causes comprise more than half of all fatal injuries to youth on U.S. farms. Women in agriculture (including the related industries of forestry and fishing) numbered 556,000 in 2011.
Agriculture in the U.S. makes up approximately 75% of the country&#x27;s pesticide use. Agricultural workers are at high risk for being exposed to dangerous levels of pesticides, whether or not they are directly working with the chemicals. For example, with issues like pesticide drift, farmworkers are not the only ones exposed to these chemicals; nearby residents come into contact with the pesticides as well. The frequent exposure to these pesticides can have detrimental effects on humans, resulting in adverse health reactions associated with pesticide poisoning. Migrant workers, especially women, are at higher risk for health issues associated with pesticide exposure due to lack of training or appropriate safety precautions. United States agricultural workers experience 10,000 cases or more of physician-diagnosed pesticide poisoning annually.

==Demographics==
The number of women working in agriculture has risen and the 2002 census of agriculture recorded a 40% increase in the number of female farm workers. Inequality and respect are common issues for these workers, as many have reported that they are not being respected, listened to, or taken seriously due to traditional views of women as housewives and caretakers.

Women may also face resistance when attempting to advance to higher positions. Other issues reported by female farm workers include receiving less pay than their male counterparts and a refusal or reluctance by their employers to offer their female workers the same additional benefits given to male workers such as housing.

As of 2012, there were 44,629 African-American farmers in the United States. The vast majority of African-American farmers were in southern states.

== Industry ==
Historically, farmland has been owned by small property owners, but as of 2017 institutional investors, including foreign corporations, had been purchasing farmland. In 2013 the largest producer of pork, Smithfield Foods, was bought by a company from China.

As of 2017, only about 4% of farms have sales over $1m, but these farms yield two-thirds of total output. Some of these are large farms have grown organically from private family-owned businesses.

==Land ownership laws==
As of 2019, six states—Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Dakota, and Oklahoma—have laws banning foreign ownership of farmland. Missouri, Ohio, and Oklahoma are looking to introduce bills banning foreign ownership as of 2019.

<doc id="242782" wikidata="Q1236412" url="?curid=242782" title="Jim Backus">
<text>James Gilmore Backus (February 25, 1913 – July 3, 1989) was an American actor. Among his most famous roles were Thurston Howell III on the 1960s sitcom &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island,&quot; the father of James Dean&#x27;s character in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause,&quot; the voice of the near-sighted cartoon character &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot;, the rich Hubert Updike III on the radio version of &quot;The Alan Young Show&quot;, and Joan Davis&#x27; character&#x27;s husband (a domestic court judge) on TV&#x27;s &quot;I Married Joan&quot;. He also starred in his own show of one season, &quot;The Jim Backus Show&quot;, also known as &quot;Hot Off the Wire&quot;.

An avid golfer, Backus made the 36-hole cut at the 1964 Bing Crosby Pro-Am tournament. He was inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.

==Early life== 
Backus was born February 25, 1913, in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in Bratenahl, Ohio, an East Side suburb of Cleveland located on the Lake Erie shore, surrounded by the city on three sides. He was the only son of Russell Gould Backus and Daisy Taylor (née Gilmore) Backus. His older sister was Katherine Jane Backus. He attended Shaw High School in East Cleveland, Ohio and graduated from University School in Shaker Heights, Ohio.

== Career ==

=== Acting ===

Backus was acting on radio as early as 1940, playing the role of millionaire aviator Dexter Hayes on &quot;Society Girl&quot; on CBS.
He had an extensive career and worked steadily in Hollywood over five decades, often portraying characters with an &quot;upper-crust&quot;, New England-like air, much like his best-known role, Thurston Howell III on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. He appeared in (and narrated) &quot;A Dangerous Profession&quot; (1949); &quot;Deadline – U.S.&quot; (1951) with Humphrey Bogart; &quot;Pat and Mike&quot; (1952) with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn; &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955); &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot; (1957); and &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963). He also made television appearances on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1962).

Backus was the voice of the nearsighted cartoon character Mr. Magoo. Years later, when Backus was a frequent talk show guest, he would recount the time Marilyn Monroe urgently beckoned him into her dressing room. Henny Backus, Jim&#x27;s wife, recalled the story: &quot;Jim was in the 1952 film &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother to Knock&quot;, with Marilyn Monroe. He came home one night during the filming and told me that Miss Monroe in her most seductive breathy voice asked him to meet her in her dressing room. His curiosity got the better of him and he went. Once there, she exclaimed like an excited child, &#x27;Do Mr. Magoo!&#x27; And Jim did.&quot;

He frequently could be heard on primetime radio programs in the postwar era, including &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, and he portrayed an exceedingly vain character named Hartley Benson on &quot;The Judy Canova Show&quot; on the CBS Radio Network, as well as a similar character named Hubert Updike on &quot;The Alan Young Show&quot; on the NBC Radio Network. He also starred on the short-lived variety program &quot;The Jim Backus Show&quot; on the ABC Radio Network in 1957 and 1958, when that network changed its name to the American Broadcasting Network (ABN) and tried out a &quot;Live and Lively&quot; format of &quot;Big Time Radio&quot; with orchestras and audiences. Backus costarred in the comedy show &quot;I Married Joan&quot; from 1952 to 1955, portraying the husband of Joan Davis.

Backus appeared as Thurston Howell III on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; for all three seasons of its run, 1964 to 1967, and later in reunion TV films, &quot;Rescue from Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1978), &quot;The Castaways on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1981). By the third and final film in 1981, Backus was suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and his participation was limited to a cameo appearance. He also voiced the character in two cartoon versions of the series, &quot;The New Adventures of Gilligan&quot; from 1974 to 1977 and &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Planet&quot; from 1982 to 1983. 

Backus also returned as the voice of Mr. Magoo in various revivals between 1964 and 1977, which included &quot;The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s New, Mr. Magoo?&quot;. In stark contrast to his usual affluent characters, he guest-starred on &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; in 1971 as an old gold prospector, a role he also played on a &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; episode. He also had a role in the final season episode &quot;The Hustler&quot; (1974) in which he plays Mike&#x27;s boss, Mr. Matthews.

Backus played Reverend Sims in the 1975 &quot;Brides and Grooms&quot; episode of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Never Con a Killer&quot; (1977), the pilot for the ABC crime drama &quot;The Feather and Father Gang&quot;. In 1981, he and his wife Henny appeared in an episode of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. In it, he had one line in his four scenes.

=== Writing and recording ===

Backus and his wife, Henny Backus, co-wrote several humorous books, including: &quot;...Only When I Laugh&quot;, his autobiography, &quot;Backus Strikes Back&quot;, a memoir, &quot;Forgive Us Our Digressions: An Autobiography&quot;, and &quot;What Are You Doing After the Orgy?&quot; — the title taken from a line Backus spoke in the 1965 film &quot;John Goldfarb, Please Come Home!&quot; He also co-wrote the 1971 family film &quot;Mooch Goes to Hollywood&quot;, about a dog that tries to become a movie star.

In the late 1950s, he made two novelty 45 rpm records, &quot;Delicious&quot; and &quot;Cave Man&quot;. In 1974, a full-length comedy LP album was released on the Doré label under the title &quot;The Dirty Old Man&quot;, with sketches written by Bob Hudson and Ron Landry, who also appear on the album, along with voice-actress Jane Webb. Backus also played the voice of God in the recording of &quot;Truth of Truths&quot;, a 1971 rock opera based on the Bible.

=== Television commercials ===
Backus acted in several television commercials. As Mr. Magoo, he also helped advertise the General Electric line of products over the years. In &quot;Bowl &#x27;Em Over with GE Bulbs&quot; (1963), a Cinécraft Productions sales training film made for the GE Large Lamp Division, Backus introduces the Mr. Magoo Soft White light bulb TV advertising campaign for Fall 1963. For the first time, General Electric commercials would be shown in color on prime-time TV shows, including the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. He was also spokesman for La-Z-Boy furniture during the 1970s. An example commercial can be heard during the Zero Hour radio program entitled “Lost In Time” broadcast in 1974.

In the late 1980s, he was reunited with former co-star Natalie Schafer in an advertisement for Orville Redenbacher&#x27;s popcorn. They reprised their roles from &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, but instead of still being shipwrecked, the setting was a luxurious study or den. This would be the final TV appearance for both actors, who were in frail health. They also both appeared on Fox&#x27;s short lived talk show &quot;The Late Show&quot; with Ross Shafer, along with the rest of the cast of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, in 1988.

== Death ==
On July 3, 1989, Backus died in Los Angeles from complications of pneumonia after suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease for many years.

<doc id="242785" wikidata="Q1334983" url="?curid=242785" title="List of Roman legions">
<text>This is a list of [[Roman legion]]s, including key facts about each legion, primarily focusing on the Principate (early Empire, 27 BC – 284 AD) legions, for which there exists substantial literary, epigraphic and archaeological evidence.

When Augustus became sole ruler in 31 BC, he disbanded about half of the over 50 legions then in existence. The remaining 28 legions became the core of the early Imperial army of the Principate (27 BC – AD 284), most lasting over three centuries. Augustus and his immediate successors transformed legions into permanent units, staffed by entirely career soldiers on standard 25-year terms.

During the Dominate period (near the end of the Empire, 284–476), legions were also professional, but are little understood due to scarcity of evidence compared to the Principate. What is clear is that late legions were radically different in size, structure, and tactical role from their predecessors, despite several retaining early period names. This was the result of the military reforms of Emperors Diocletian and Constantine I, and of further developments during the 4th century.

The legions were identified by Roman numerals, though the spelling sometimes differed from the modern standard. For example, in addition to the spellings &quot;IV&quot;, &quot;IX&quot;, &quot;XIV&quot;, &quot;XVIII&quot; and &quot;XIX&quot;, the respective spellings &quot;IIII&quot;, &quot;VIIII&quot;, &quot;XIIII&quot;, &quot;XIIX&quot; and &quot;XVIIII&quot; were commonly used. Legions also bore a &quot;cognomen&quot; or nickname. While neither a legion&#x27;s number or &quot;cognomen&quot; were likely unique enough to identify it, the combination of the two is usually needed to identify a specific legion. For example, both Legio III Cyrenaica and Legio III Gallica were distinct, long-standing legions of the late Republic and Imperial periods. To visually identify legions, they also bore a specific emblem, a symbolic representation of the legion, frequently an animal or mythological figure, which appeared on the vexillum, a small rectangular flag that served as the legion&#x27;s standard and carried both the emblem and name of the legion.

==Late Republican legions==

Republican legions were formed by compulsory levy of Roman citizens (who met a minimum property qualification) and raised whenever it was necessary. Usually they were authorized by the Roman Senate and later disbanded.

Throughout the late Republic, soldiers and commanders served only for short periods intending, respectively, to secure plunder or political advancement from military victory. There is little evidence of changes in the wealth and social backgrounds of the men who joined before and after the opening of recruitment; the pay remained pitiful. Conscription remained the main method by which Rome mustered troops. The evidence for the abolition of property requirements is very weak, and there were no significant changes in population size or demographics that would drive such a reduction. The bulk of recruits were still landed citizens, who would appear poor to the elites authoring the surviving sources. Again, their pay was not enough to sustain professional career in the military, and soldiers generally did not expect land grants after discharge.

In the last century of the Republic, proconsuls governing frontier provinces became increasingly powerful. Their command of standing legions in distant and arduous military campaigns resulted in the allegiance of those units transferring from the Roman state to themselves. These &quot;imperatores&quot; (lit: victorious generals, from the title imperator they were hailed with by their troops) frequently fell out with each other and started civil wars to seize control of the state, such as Sulla, Caesar, Pompey, Crassus, Mark Antony and Octavian (later Augustus, the first Emperor himself). In this context, the &quot;imperatores&quot; raised many legions that were not authorised by the Senate, sometimes having to use their own resources. As civil wars were resolved, many of these &quot;private&quot; units would be disbanded, only for more to be raised to fight the next civil war. By the time Augustus emerged as sole ruler of Rome in 31 BC, over 50 legions were in existence, many of which were disbanded.

The legions included in the following list had a long enough history to be somehow remarkable. Most of them were levied by Julius Caesar and later included into Octavian&#x27;s army, some of them were levied by Marc Antony.

Codes for Roman provinces in the table:

===Legend===

====Legion number and title (cognomen)====
The numbering of the legions is confusing, since several legions shared the same number with others. Augustus numbered the legions he founded himself from I, but also inherited numbers from his predecessors. Each emperor normally numbered the legions he raised himself starting from I. However, even this practice was not consistently followed. For example, Vespasian kept the same numbers as before for legions he raised from disbanded units. Trajan&#x27;s first legion was numbered XXX because there were 29 other legions in existence at the time it was raised; but the second Trajanic legion was given the sequential number II. XVII, XVIII and XIX, the numbers of the legions annihilated in the Teutoburg Forest, were never used again. (These three legions are without titles, suggesting that in disgrace their titles may have been deliberately forgotten or left unmentioned.) As a result of this somewhat chaotic evolution, the legion&#x27;s title became necessary to distinguish between legions with the same number.

Legions often carried several titles, awarded after successive campaigns, normally by the ruling emperor e.g. XII Fulminata was also awarded: &quot;paterna&quot; (fatherly), &quot;victrix&quot; (victorious), &quot;antiqua&quot; (venerable), &quot;certa constans&quot; (reliable, steadfast) and &quot;Galliena&quot; (Gallienus &#x27;). &quot;Pia fidelis&quot; (loyal and faithful), &quot;fidelis constans&quot; and others were titles awarded to several legions, sometimes several times to the same legion. Only the most established, commonly used titles are displayed on this table.

The geographical titles indicate
* the country a legion was originally recruited e.g. &quot;Italica&quot; = from Italy or
* peoples the legion has vanquished e.g.&quot;Parthica&quot; = victorious over the Parthians
Legions bearing the personal name of an emperor, or of his &quot;gens&quot; (clan) (e.g. &quot;Augusta&quot;, &quot;Flavia&quot;) were either founded by that Emperor or awarded the name as a mark of special favour.

The title GEMINA means that two diminished legions have been combined to make one new one.

====Main legionary base====
This shows the &quot;castra&quot; (base) where the legion spent the longest period during the Principate. Legions often shared the same base with other legions. Detachments of legions were often seconded for lengthy periods to other bases and provinces, as operational needs demanded.

====Emblem====
Legions often sported more than one emblem at the same time, and occasionally changed them. Legions raised by Caesar mostly carried a bull emblem originally; those of Augustus mostly a Capricorn

====Date disbanded====
For legions that are documented into the 4th century and beyond, we do not know when or how they were terminated. For legions disappearing from the record before 284, the reason (certain or likely) is given as:
*XX = annihilated in battle
*DD = disbanded in disgrace
*UF = unknown fate

====Castra legionaria====
Indicates the bases (&quot;castra&quot;) and/or provinces where the legion was based during its history, with dates.

====Notes====
Contains points of note, including explanation of titles and details of a legion&#x27;s fate.

Province names and borders are assumed throughout the Principate period as at 107, during the rule of Trajan, and after the annexation of Dacia and Arabia Petraea. The map above shows provinces at the end of Trajan&#x27;s reign, 117. They are the same as in 107, except that Armenia and Mesopotamia have been annexed (they were abandoned soon after Trajan&#x27;s death); and Pannonia has been split into two (the split occurred ). In reality provincial borders were modified several times between 30 BC and 284: this explains any discrepancy with other sources, as to a legion&#x27;s location at a particular date.

== Late Empire legions ==
Diocletian reorganized the Roman army, in order to better counter the threat of the Germanic peoples of northern Europe as well as that of the Persians from the East. The army was formed by &quot;border&quot; and &quot;field&quot; units.

The &quot;border&quot; (&quot;limitanei&quot;) units were to occupy the limes, the structured border fortifications, and were formed by professional soldiers with an inferior training.

The &quot;field&quot; units were to stay well behind the border, and to move quickly where they were needed, with both offensive and defensive roles. Field units were formed by elite soldiers with high-level training and weapons. They were further divided into:
# &quot;Scholae&quot;: the personal guard of the Emperor, created by Constantine I to replace the Praetorian Guard;
# &quot;Palatinae&quot;: &quot;palace troops&quot; were the highest ranked units, created by Constantine I after he disbanded the Praetorian Guard, it was comprised originally of former guardsmen;
# &quot;Comitatenses&quot;: regular field units, some were newly-formed, others were descended from Early-Empire legions;
# &quot;Pseudocomitatenses&quot;: these were &quot;limitanei&quot; units diverted into the field army and often kept there; some Early Empire legions became &quot;pseudocomitatenses&quot; units.

These units usually numbered between 300 and 2,000 soldiers and some of them kept their original numbering schemes. The primary source for the legions of this era is the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, a late 4th-century document containing all the civil and military offices of both halves of the Roman Empire (revised in for the Western Empire).

<text>Nurse crops are a subtype of nurse plants, facilitating the growth of other species of plants. The term is used primarily in agriculture, but also in forestry. Cover crops are a type of nurse crop.

== Agriculture ==
In agriculture, a nurse crop is an annual crop used to assist in establishment of a perennial crop. The widest use of nurse crops is in the establishment of legumaceous plants such as alfalfa, clover, and trefoil. Occasionally, nurse crops are used for establishment of perennial grasses.

Nurse crops reduce the incidence of weeds, prevent erosion, and prevent excessive sunlight from reaching tender seedlings. Often, the nurse crop can be harvested for grain, straw, hay, or pasture. Oats are the most common nurse crop, though other annual grains are also used. Nurse cropping of tall or dense-canopied plants can protect more vulnerable species through shading or by providing a wind break.

However, if ill-maintained, nurse crops can block sunlight from reaching seedlings.

Trap crops prevent pests from affecting the desired plant. 

== Forestry ==
In forestry, &#x27;nurse crop&#x27; can be applied to trees or shrubs that help the development of other species of trees. Wind breaking, frost protection, thermal insulation, and shade can all be provided by nurse crops in forests. Aspens especially provide partial shade, allowing understory growth.

<doc id="242787" wikidata="Q3154573" url="?curid=242787" title="Baker Street Irregulars">
<text>The Baker Street Irregulars are fictional characters who appear in three Sherlock Holmes stories, specifically two novels and one short story, by Arthur Conan Doyle. They are street boys who are employed by Holmes as intelligence agents. The name has subsequently been adopted by other organizations, most notably a prestigious and exclusive literary society founded in the United States by Christopher Morley in 1934.

== Fictional profile ==
The original Baker Street Irregulars are fictional characters in the Sherlock Holmes stories of Arthur Conan Doyle. The group of street urchins is led by a boy called Wiggins. They run errands and track down information for Holmes. According to Holmes, they are able to &quot;go everywhere and hear everything&quot;. Holmes also says that they &quot;are as sharp as needles, too; all they want is organisation.&quot; In &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot;, which takes place in 1888, it is shown that Holmes pays them each a shilling per day (), and Holmes offers a guinea prize () as a reward for the one who locates the steam launch that he wants them to find.

The group appears in the first Sherlock Holmes story, the novel &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; (1887), which is set in 1881. When Watson meets the group, he describes them as &quot;half a dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged s that ever I clapped eyes on&quot;. Holmes introduces them as &quot;the Baker Street division of the detective police force&quot;. The group enters 221B Baker Street together, but since they upset Holmes&#x27;s landlady (who is unnamed in this story but later named Mrs. Hudson), Holmes tells them that in future, only their leader Wiggins should report to him. He pays them each a shilling to track down a certain cabman. They find the cabman, Jefferson Hope, successfully. Wiggins brings him to 221B Baker Street, where the cabman is apprehended by Holmes.

They also appear in the next novel, &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot; (1890), set in 1888, in which one of the chapters is titled &quot;The Baker Street Irregulars&quot;. In this story, Holmes describes them as &quot;the unofficial force — the Baker Street irregulars&quot;. As in &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, the group enters 221B Baker Street together and Holmes instructs them to only have Wiggins report to him in future. Wiggins receives three shillings and sixpence (which he calls &quot;Three bob and a tanner&quot;) from Holmes for expenses in addition to his regular wage. Holmes directs the Baker Street Irregulars to search for a steam launch called the &quot;Aurora&quot;. However, they do not succeed and Holmes ultimately joins the search by disguising himself as a sailor. Though approximately seven years have passed since &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, Wiggins is still the leader of the Baker Street Irregulars. He is described as being taller and older than the others, and has an &quot;air of lounging superiority&quot;.

One of the group appears in the short story &quot;The Adventure of the Crooked Man&quot; (1893). In the story, Holmes has a member of the group, named Simpson, watch Henry Wood. As Holmes says, &quot;I have one of my Baker Street boys mounting guard over him who would stick to him like a burr, go where he might&quot;. Simpson, whom Watson describes as &quot;a small street Arab&quot;, briefly appears in the story to report to Holmes.

Though not one of the Baker Street Irregulars, a similar character named Cartwright appears in &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (1902). Cartwright, who works in a district messenger office, secretly runs errands for Holmes on the moor and keeps him supplied while disguised as a country boy. At one point Watson sees the disguised Cartwright running errands, and describes him as &quot;a small urchin&quot; and a &quot;ragged uncouth figure&quot;. Cartwright is described as a &quot;lad of fourteen&quot; in the novel. Another similar character, a pageboy named Billy, assists Holmes in &quot;The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone&quot;.

According to Daniel Smith in his book &quot; The Sherlock Holmes Companion&quot;, Holmes was skilled at developing a network of agents who could assist him in any situation, and this network included multiple &quot;outsider&quot; figures such as the Baker Street Irregulars as well as Cartwright, Billy, and former criminal Shinwell Johnson. Smith wrote that this shows that Holmes &quot;realised the value of reliable assistants and was humble enough to look for them in places where others of his status might have never deigned to tread&quot;.

<doc id="242789" wikidata="Q333182" url="?curid=242789" title="Iain Macleod">
<text>Iain Norman Macleod (11 November 1913 – 20 July 1970) was a British Conservative Party politician.

A playboy and professional bridge player in his twenties, after war service Macleod worked for the Conservative Research Department before entering Parliament in 1950. He was noted as a formidable Parliamentary debater and—later—as a platform orator. He was quickly appointed Minister of Health, later serving as Minister of Labour. He served an important term as Secretary of State for the Colonies under Harold Macmillan in the early 1960s, overseeing the independence of many African countries from British rule but earning the enmity of Conservative right-wingers, and the soubriquet that he was &quot;too clever by half&quot;.

Macleod was unhappy with the &quot;emergence&quot; of Sir Alec Douglas-Home as party leader and prime minister in succession to Macmillan in 1963 (he claimed to have supported Macmillan&#x27;s deputy Rab Butler, although it is unclear exactly what his recommendation had been). He refused to serve in Home&#x27;s government, and while serving as editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot; alleged that the succession had been stitched up by Macmillan and a &quot;magic circle&quot; of Old Etonians.

Macleod did not contest the first ever Conservative Party leadership election in 1965, but endorsed the eventual winner Edward Heath. When the Conservatives returned to power in June 1970, he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in Heath&#x27;s government, but died suddenly only a month later.

==Early life==
Iain Macleod was born at Clifford House, Skipton, Yorkshire, on 11 November 1913. His father, Dr. Norman Alexander Macleod, was a well-respected general practitioner in Skipton, with a substantial poor-law practice (providing medical services for those who could not afford to pay); the young Macleod would often accompany his father on his rounds. His parents were from the Isle of Lewis in the Western Isles of Scotland, his father a descendant of tenant farmers on Pabbay and Uig, tracing back to the early 1500s. They moved to Skipton in 1907. Macleod grew up with strong personal and cultural ties to Scotland, as his parents bought in 1917 part of the Leverhulme estate on the Isle of Lewis, where they often used to stay for family holidays.

He was educated at Ermysted&#x27;s Grammar School in Skipton, followed by four years (beginning in 1923) at St Ninian&#x27;s Dumfriesshire, followed by five years at the private school Fettes College in Edinburgh. Macleod showed no great academic talent, but did develop an enduring love of literature, especially poetry, which he read and memorised in great quantity. In his final year at school Macleod appears to have blossomed a little, standing for Oswald Mosley&#x27;s New Party in the mock election in October 1931; he came third, behind the Unionist and Ian Harvey who stood as a Scottish nationalist and came second. He won the School History Prize in his final year.

==Cambridge and cards==
In 1932, Macleod went up to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he read History. His only recorded speech at the Cambridge Union Society was in his first term against the Ottawa agreement – his biographer comments that although not too much should be made of this, it suggests a lack of sentimental attachment to the Empire. He took no other part in student politics, but spent much of his time reading poetry and playing bridge, both for the University (he helped to found the Cambridge University Bridge Society) and at Crockfords and in the West End. He graduated with a Lower Second in 1935.

A bridge connection with the chairman of the printing company De La Rue earned him a job offer. However, he devoted most of his energies to bridge and, by 1936, was an international bridge player. He was one of the great British bridge players. He won the Gold Cup in 1937, with teammates Maurice Harrison-Gray (Capt), Skid Simon, Jack Marx and Colin Harding.

At a time when average male earnings were around £200 per annum (around £11,000 at 2016 prices) and he was earning around £150 per annum at De La Rue, Macleod sometimes made £100 in a night gambling, but on another occasion had to borrow £100 from his father to pay his debts. Macleod was often too tired to work in the mornings after gambling for much of the night, although he tended to perk up as the day went on; he was popular with colleagues and on at least one occasion mucked in to work overtime for a last-minute order for Chinese banknotes. His biographer comments that he &quot;might have stayed&quot; had he found the work more interesting, but after tolerating him for a number of years De La Rue sacked him in 1938.

In order to placate his father he joined the Inner Temple and went through the motions of studying to become a barrister, but in the late 1930s he was essentially living the life of a playboy from his bridge earnings. He was winning up to £2,500 per annum tax free (around £140,000 at 2016 prices).

He later wrote a book that contains a description of the Acol system of : &quot;Bridge is an Easy Game&quot;, published in 1952 by Falcon Press, London. He was still earning money from playing and writing newspaper columns about bridge until 1952, when his developing political career became his priority.

==War service==
===Early war===
In September 1939, upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Macleod enlisted in the British Army as a private in the Royal Fusiliers. On 20 April 1940, he was commissioned as an officer with the rank of second lieutenant in the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment (DWR), with the service number 129352. He was posted to the 2/7th Battalion, DWR, which was then serving as part of the 137th Infantry Brigade of the 46th Infantry Division, a second line Territorial Army (TA) formation, then commanded by Major-General Henry Curtis. Macleod&#x27;s battalion was sent overseas to France in time to see action in the Battle of France in May, where he was injured in the leg by a flying log when a German armoured car burst through a road block which his men had just erected. He was treated in hospital in Exeter and left with a lifelong slight limp. In later life, besides his limp he suffered pain and reduced mobility from the spinal condition ankylosing spondylitis.

At the age of 27, Macleod was already considered somewhat too old to be a platoon commander. Once fit for duty again, he served as a staff captain with the 46th Division in Wye, under the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General (DAAG), Captain Dawtry. In 1941, a drunk Macleod almost killed Dawtry, as the latter had retired to bed rather than play stud poker with him. He shot at his door until his revolver ran out of bullets, and then passed out after smashing down the door with a heavy piece of furniture. He demanded an apology the next morning for his refusal to play, although the two men remained friends thereafter. Dawtry later became Chief Clerk of Westminster Council.

===Staff College, D-Day and European campaign===
Macleod attended Staff College, Camberley, in 1943, and graduated early in February 1944, having for the first time had to test his abilities against other able men and found something of a purpose in life.

As a major, he landed in France on Gold Beach on D-Day on 6 June 1944, as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster general (DAQMG) of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, a first line TA formation, under the command of Major-General Douglas Graham. Macleod embarked on 1 June ready for the invasion, which was then postponed from 5 June to 6 June. The 50th Division, a highly experienced veteran formation which had fought in North Africa and Sicily, was tasked with capturing Arromanches, where the Mulberry artificial harbour was to be set up, and by the end of the day patrols had pushed to the outskirts of Bayeux. Macleod spent much of the day touring the beachhead area to check on progress, driving past enemy-held strongpoints, with Lieutenant Colonel &quot;Bertie&quot; Gibb. He later recorded that he had &quot;a patchwork of memories&quot; of D-Day. He could remember what he ate but not when he ate it, or that when he went to load his revolver he found his batman had instead filled his ammunition pouch with boiled sweets. British planners had expected 40% casualties on D-Day, and Macleod later recorded that he himself had fully expected to be killed, but on realising at midnight that he had survived D-Day decided that he would survive the war and see the birth of his second child in October.

Contemporaries began to record him saying that autumn that he planned to enter politics and become prime minister. He continued to serve in France and the Low Countries until November 1944, when the 50th Division was, due to a highly critical shortage of manpower in the British Army at this stage of the war, ordered to return to Yorkshire to be reconstituted as a training division. Macleod ended the war as a major.

===1945 election and final Army service===
Macleod unsuccessfully contested the Western Isles constituency at the 1945 general election. There was no Conservative Party in the seat, so Macleod advertised an inaugural meeting. He and his father, a lifelong Liberal but an admirer of Winston Churchill, were the only attendees, so Macleod elected his father Association Chairman and he selected his son as Parliamentary candidate, in due course receiving a letter of endorsement from Churchill. Macleod came bottom of the poll, obtaining 2,756 votes out of 13,000. Macleod&#x27;s father died at the start of 1947, just at the onset of the exceptionally bitter winter.

With the 50th Division now largely disbanded, its HQ was sent to Norway after the end of hostilities in May 1945 as part of Operation Doomsday, supervising the surrender of German forces and repatriation of Allied prisoners. In Norway, Macleod was in charge of setting prices for the country&#x27;s stock of wine and spirits, much of which had been looted by the Germans from occupied France. In December 1945, he successfully defended a colonel at a court martial, and was tipped for a career at the Bar by the presiding officer. He was demobilised from the British Army in January 1946.

==Entry into politics==
In 1946, after an interview with David Clarke, Macleod joined the Conservative Parliamentary Secretariat, writing briefing papers for Conservative MPs on Scotland, labour (employment, in modern parlance) and health matters.

Macleod was selected as Conservative candidate for Enfield in 1946. Forty-seven applicants were already being considered; through a bridge connection Macleod arranged a meeting with the Enfield Conservative Association chairman and persuaded him to add his CV to the list. After interviews, he reached the final shortlist of four. Macleod came second after making a poor speech to the assembled Association at the selection meeting, but the winning candidate failed to achieve the required 10% majority. Amid accusations of skulduggery—the members had not been told of this requirement in advance and forty of them, the representatives of two branches, walked out in protest—a second meeting was scheduled, at which Macleod performed much better and won handsomely. Throughout both meetings he had been strongly supported by the local Young Conservatives, who could vote on Association matters despite in some cases being not yet old enough to vote for Parliament – the 15-year-old Norman Tebbit was a branch officer for Ponders End (a working class area).

Enfield had been won by the Conservatives several times in the interwar period, but with a 12,000 Labour majority in 1945 was not regarded as an immediate prospect. In 1948, the Parliamentary boundaries were redrawn, and Macleod was unanimously selected for the new and much more winnable Enfield, West, which he would win in February 1950 and hold comfortably throughout his career.

In 1948, the Secretariat merged with the Conservative Research Department under Rab Butler. Macleod was in joint, then sole, charge of Home Affairs. He drafted the Social Services section of the Conservative policy paper &quot;The Right Road for Britain&quot; (1949).

Along with Enoch Powell, Angus Maude and Reginald Maudling, Macleod was seen as a protégé of Butler at the CRD. David Clarke thought Macleod the least intellectually gifted of the three but later came to think him the most politically gifted. All four men were elected to Parliament in February 1950, and along with Edward Heath who entered Parliament at the same time they became members of the &quot;One Nation&quot; group. Together with Angus Maude Macleod wrote the pamphlet &quot;One Nation&quot; in 1950, and together with Enoch Powell he wrote &quot;The Social Services: Needs and Means&quot; which appeared in January 1952.

Macleod and Powell were close friends at this time. He was astonished when the ascetic Powell became engaged. Powell, a much more industrious man, was somewhat jealous of Macleod&#x27;s promotion at the Research Department, and had difficulty being selected for a winnable seat, so Macleod coached him in interview technique.

==Political career==

===Minister of Health===
In October 1951 Churchill again became prime minister. Macleod was not offered office but instead became Chairman of the backbench Health and Social Services Committee.

A brilliant Commons performance made his career. On 27 March 1952, having been called fifth in the debate rather than third as originally scheduled, he spoke after former Health Minister Aneurin Bevan. Beginning his speech with the words &quot;I wish to deal closely and with relish with the vulgar, crude and intemperate speech to which the House of Commons has just listened&quot;, he attacked Bevan with facts and figures and commented that a health debate without Bevan would be like &quot;&quot;Hamlet&quot; without the first gravedigger&quot;. Churchill, who had been getting up to leave, stayed to listen and was heard to ask the Chief Whip, Patrick Buchan-Hepburn, who the promising young backbencher was. When summoned to 10 Downing Street on 7 May, he claimed to have been half-expecting a reprimand for his refusal to serve a second term as a British representative at the Council of Europe, a job he found boring, but he was instead appointed Minister of Health, which was not a Cabinet position at that time.

Later in 1952, Macleod announced that British clinician Richard Doll had proved the link between smoking and lung cancer. He did so at a press conference throughout which he chain-smoked.

Macleod became a member of White&#x27;s Club in 1953, and shocked members by sitting up all night to play cards. His friend Enoch Powell was jealous at Macleod&#x27;s rapid promotion, but offered Macleod the use of a room at his flat when Eve Macleod was seriously ill with polio.

Macleod consolidated rather than reformed the NHS, administered it well and defended it against Treasury attacks on its budget.

===Minister of Labour===
In the reshuffle of December 1955, Prime Minister Anthony Eden promoted Macleod to the Cabinet as Minister of Labour and National Service. Eden regarded Macleod, still only 42 years old, as a possible future prime minister and thought the job would be valuable experience of dealing with trade unions.

====Suez crisis====
Macleod was not directly involved in the collusion with France and Israel over the Suez Crisis, but although he was unhappy at the turn of events, he did not resign. He never publicly opposed Suez, either at the time or later. He was party to the two crucial Cabinet decisions: the first was the decision on 21 March for a policy of hostility to Nasser, who was seen as a threat to British interests in the Middle East, and of building new alliances with Jordan and Iraq; this led to the withdrawal of American and British financial aid for the Aswan Dam, which in turn triggered Nasser&#x27;s nationalisation of the Canal. Macleod was also party to the Cabinet decision on 27 July, the day after nationalisation the Canal, that Nasser&#x27;s action should be opposed on the grounds that the Canal was an international trust and that Britain, if necessary acting alone, should use force as a last resort. Macleod was not a member of the Egypt Committee, and still less was he party to Eden and Lloyd&#x27;s secret dealings with the French and the Israelis.

Macleod&#x27;s duties required him to discuss the Suez Crisis with union leaders. In August 1956, he spoke to Vincent Tewson, General Secretary of the TUC, and found him &quot;very &quot;weak-kneed&quot;&quot; and &quot;ill-informed&quot;. On 20 August, Macleod and Eden met Tewson, Beard of the Engineers&#x27; Union and Geddes of the Postmen&#x27;s Union, and agreed that the upcoming TUC Conference would back an equivocal resolution by Geddes.

On 25 August, the day after Monckton&#x27;s &quot;outburst&quot; expressing doubts at the Egypt Committee, Cabinet Secretary Norman Brook sent a note to Eden listing Macleod as among those Cabinet members (the others being Butler, Monckton, Derrick Heathcoat Amory, the Earls of Selkirk and Kilmuir, as well as Heath who, as Chief Whip, attended Cabinet but was not technically a full member) who would want to postpone military action until all other options had been exhausted or until Nasser provided them with a better pretext, whichever came first. There were three unknowns and ten hawks—a narrow Cabinet majority in favour of military action.

On 11 September, at Cabinet, Eden tasked Macleod with finding out if there would be trouble from the unions in the event of military operations in the Eastern Mediterranean. However, Norman Brook advised Macleod to &quot;hold his hand for the moment, as this was not the appropriate time&quot;. It is unclear if this initiative came from Brook or was in response to an inquiry from Macleod himself.

====Suez: decision to invade====
Macleod missed the thinly-attended Cabinet on 18 October, but afterwards was sent Eden&#x27;s minute that he&#x27;d told the French that every effort must be made to stop Israel attacking Jordan, whilst Eden had told Israel that Britain would &quot;not&quot; come to Egypt&#x27;s aid. It is not known whether Macleod knew of the secret Protocol of Sèvres. On 23 October, Eden told the Cabinet that there had been secret talks with Israel in Paris.

The Cabinet further considered the use of force on 24 October. On 25 October, Eden told the Cabinet that Israel would attack Egypt after all, but did not tell them about the secret Sèvres Protocol. Cabinet minutes record that Macleod was doubtful about the use of force (as were Monckton and Heathcoat Amory) because of the lack of clear UN authority and the risk of antagonising the USA. However, they did not formally dissent from the Cabinet decision to invade if Israel attacked Egypt (the Cabinet were deceived about the extent to which such an attack had already been secretly agreed – &quot;collusion&quot; – by Eden and Selwyn Lloyd).

At Cabinet on the morning of 30 October, Lloyd reported that the USA was ready to move a motion at the UN condemning Israel, which had attacked Egypt in the Sinai the previous day, as an aggressor. Macleod and Heathcoat Amory approved of Lloyd&#x27;s suggestion of postponing the attack by 24 hours (in breach, as it happens, of the secret agreement between Britain, France and Israel) in order to bring the Americans on board, although they thought it unlikely to work, but it was not adopted. Macleod was telling others of his dismay that ministers had not been fully informed of the agreement with France and Israel. Either now or at some subsequent meeting Eden apologised to the Cabinet for his reticence &quot;in time of war&quot;, causing Macleod to snap &quot;I was not aware that we were at war, Prime Minister!&quot; The Anglo-French ultimatum was on the afternoon of 30 October.

On 2 November, the Cabinet agreed that even in the event of a ceasefire between Egypt and Israel, Anglo-French forces should still seize the Canal in a policing role until UN forces were able to take up the baton (Macleod and Heathcoat Amory were doubtful). By the weekend of 3–4 November, fighting between Israel and Egypt had largely ceased. At Cabinet on Sunday 4 November, the Cabinet decided to go ahead with the landings (but hand over to peacekeeping duties to the UN at some future date, an option which Macleod (and Heathcoat Amory) argued was hardly compatible with use of force). The other options had been to postpone by 24 hours in the hope that Israel and Egypt might accept an Anglo-French occupation (a view supported by Butler, Kilmuir, Heathcote Amory and an &quot;unnamed minister&quot;, presumed to be Macleod), or postpone indefinitely on the grounds that Israeli-Egyptian hostilities had already ceased (the view of Salisbury, Monckton and Buchan-Hepburn). Only Monckton had his dissent recorded, the others agreeing to accept the decision of the majority.

Randolph Churchill alleged that Macleod almost resigned on 4 November. Nigel Fisher wrote that this was not so, but that Macleod would have resigned if Butler had done so. Robert Carr, junior minister at the Ministry of Labour, wrote that Macleod had doubts but was not especially morally outraged, and saw no evidence that he planned to resign. William Rees-Mogg claimed that Butler persuaded Macleod not to resign, while a female friend of Macleod&#x27;s recorded him turning up at her flat, demanding a drink, and declaring that he would have to resign having learned that Eden had deceived the Cabinet.

Suez alienated academics, journalists and other opinion-formers from the Conservative Party. William Rees-Mogg, then a Conservative candidate in the North-East, made a speech urging that Macleod be party leader. David Astor of &quot;The Observer&quot;, who on 4 November had attacked Eden for &quot;crookedness&quot; in an editorial, wrote to Macleod on 14 November, urging him as a younger minister to seize the party leadership so that collusion could be pinned on Eden and Lloyd, after Edward Boyle had told him that he was not interested and that Monckton was not up to it. Macleod did not reply but showed the letter to Freddie Bishop, head of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Private Office, and Cabinet Secretary Norman Brook for their comments; Eden, who was on the verge of a breakdown, did not regard the matter as important. On 20 November 1956 the question of collusion was raised in Cabinet, with Eden and Lloyd (who was in New York at a United Nations meeting) both absent; Shepherd believes that it was probably Macleod who raised it. The Cabinet agreed to stick to Lloyd&#x27;s formula that Britain had not &quot;incited&quot; the Israeli attack on Egypt.

====1958 bus strike====
When Eden stepped down as prime minister in January 1957, Lord Kilmuir, formally witnessed by Lord Salisbury, took a straw poll of the Cabinet to determine his successor; despite his closeness to Butler, Macleod, along with the overwhelming majority of his colleagues, backed Harold Macmillan, regarding him as a stronger leader.

Macleod had intended at first to be a reforming Minister of Labour – he attempted, in the teeth of resistance from the TUC, to negotiate a Workers&#x27; Charter (a throwback to the Industrial Charter of the late 1940s) in return for a Contract of Service. He also hoped to take a tougher line with strikes than his predecessor Walter Monckton, whose explicit remit had been to appease the unions. The unions were beginning to become more militant, under the leadership of Frank Cousins, boss of the TGWU.

Macleod had to settle strikes in the shipbuilding and engineering industries in 1957, but in 1958 the government felt able to take a stronger line with the London bus strike. Macleod initially accepted his own chief Industrial Commissioner&#x27;s Investigation into the busmens&#x27; case. Macmillan, backed by the Cabinet, insisted on settling a separate railwaymen&#x27;s strike, despite an arbitration award against them, as it was felt that they had more public sympathy than the busmen. On the bus issue, Macleod was overruled and forced to pick a fight with Frank Cousins on the pretext that they accept an independent arbitration award.

Macmillan had picked a fight shrewdly, as the busmen had no allies amongst the other unions. Ernest Bevin or Arthur Deakin would not have allowed such a strike, but Cousins felt compelled to support it, and Opposition leader Hugh Gaitskell criticised the government in a speech at Glasgow. Gaitskell moved a motion of censure over Macleod&#x27;s treatment of the strike. Macleod had recently demanded more debates on industrial relations but in his Commons speech of 8 May now criticised the opposition for demanding one. He moved the house to laugh at Gaitskell by quoting the line of &quot;Mr Marx, of whom I am a devoted follower – Groucho, not Karl&quot; &quot;Sir, I never forget a face, but I will make an exception for yours&quot;. He then moved on to a blistering attack on Gaitskell, including the declaration that &quot;I cannot conceal the scorn and contempt for the part that the Leader of the Opposition has played in this.&quot; He was discreetly congratulated afterwards by the Labour frontbencher Alf Robens. Roy Jenkins in 1993 described Macleod&#x27;s attack on Gaitskell as &quot;high order jugular debating&quot;, accusing Gaitskell of weak leadership in appeasing the militants of his own party and attacking him for refusing to endorse the findings of the arbitration tribunal.

Cousins wanted to call out the petrol tanker drivers, in breach of another agreement, but was blocked from doing so by the TUC. The strike ended after seven weeks, and Macmillan dated the government&#x27;s recovery in the polls from this point. After the TUC refused to back him, Cousins had had to settle the London transport workers strike on terms which he could have obtained without striking. In October 1958 Macleod announced that he was letting the National Arbitration Tribunal go out of existence. Macleod had acquired a national reputation as a tough figure.

Macleod was on the Steering Committee to decide on political strategy in the runup to the 1959 election, at which the Macmillan government was re-elected.

===Colonial Secretary===

Macleod was appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies in October 1959. He had never set foot in any of Britain&#x27;s colonies, but the Hola massacre in Kenya had helped focus his thinking on the inevitable end of Empire. He told Peter Goldman of the Conservative Research Department that he intended to be the Colonial Secretary, although he later wrote that he &quot;telescoped events rather than creating new ones&quot;. He saw Nigeria, British Somaliland, Tanganyika, Sierra Leone, Kuwait and British Cameroon become independent. He made a tour of Sub-Saharan Africa in 1960. He would often find himself in conflict with the more conservative Duncan Sandys, whom Macmillan had appointed Commonwealth Secretary as a counterweight to Macleod. Although Macmillan sympathised with Macleod&#x27;s aspirations, he was sometimes disturbed at the speed with which he progressed matters, and did not always come down on his side in political disputes.

The state of emergency in Kenya was lifted on 12 January 1960, followed that same month by the Lancaster House Conference, containing Africans and &quot;some&quot; European delegates, including Macleod&#x27;s brother Rhoderick, which agreed to a constitution and eventual black majority rule. Jomo Kenyatta was freed in August 1961, and Kenya later became self-governing in June 1963 and fully independent on 12 December 1963.

As the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Macleod attended the Ugandan Constitutional Conference at Lancaster House in 1961 alongside then-Governor of Uganda Sir Frederick Crawford and Ugandan politician A.G. Mehta. The conference resulted in the first Ugandan Constitution, which took effect on 9 October 1962.

In Nyasaland (later Malawi), he pushed for the release of Hastings Banda, contrary to the advice of the Governor and of other politicians. He had to threaten resignation in the Cabinet to get his own way, but won Macmillan round and Banda was released in April 1960 and almost immediately invited to London for talks aimed at bringing about independence. During a visit to Nyasaland in 1960, he is described as having been &quot;gratuitously and grossly offensive, extremely rude and downright unpleasant at a meeting with the Governor, the provincial commissioners and senior police officers&quot;. On the following day, according to the same report, he &quot;lost control of himself, shouted at the non-official members of Executive Council and told one of them to &#x27;mind his own bloody business&#x27;&quot;. Elections were held in August 1961, and by 1962, the British and the Central African Federation cabinets had agreed that Nyasaland should be allowed to secede from the CAF; Banda was formally recognised as prime minister on 1 February 1963.

Macleod described his policy over Northern Rhodesia (modern Zambia) as &quot;incredibly devious and tortuous&quot; but &quot;easily the one I am most proud of&quot;. Macleod&#x27;s initial plan for a Legislative Council with an African majority (16 African members to 14 Europeans) was strongly opposed by Sir Roy Welensky, Prime Minister of the Central African Federation. After a long battle in the first half of 1961, and under pressure from cabinet colleagues, Macleod accepted Welensky&#x27;s proposal for a council of 45 members, 15 of whom would be elected by a largely African electoral roll, 15 by a largely European roll, 14 by both rolls jointly (with a further stipulation that successful candidates had to gain at least 10% of the African votes and 10% of the European ones) and 1 by Asians. Macleod&#x27;s role in these negotiations attracted damaging and much-remembered criticism by the party grandee, the Marquess of Salisbury, who had resigned from a senior position in the Cabinet over Cyprus in 1957. In a speech in the House of Lords on 7 March 1961, Salisbury denounced Macleod as &quot;too clever by half&quot; and accused him of bridge-table trickery. The new constitution, which was equally disliked by both Africans and Europeans, helped to weaken the Central African Federation, which was later wound up by Rab Butler at the Victoria Falls Conference on 5 July 1963.

The burden of hospitality left Macleod seriously out of pocket. However, hospitality helped achieve a deal with Julius Nyerere, Prime Minister of self-governing Tanganyika. Macleod was keen to point to a colony which was able to proceed peacefully to independence. Tanzania, as it was renamed, became fully independent in December 1961.

Macleod had no time to take any interest in the Pacific, South Arabia (modern-day Yemen and Oman), or the Mediterranean. He never met the Maltese leader Dom Mintoff. He described his lack of interest in the Caribbean Federation as &quot;my main area of failure&quot;. In his final party conference speech as Colonial Secretary, in October 1961, he declared that &quot;I believe quite simply in the brotherhood of man – men of all races, of all colours, of all creeds&quot;.

Welensky accused Macleod of a &quot;mixture of cold calculation, sudden gushes of undignified emotion and ignorance of Africa&quot;. Historian Wm. Roger Louis wrote that &quot;Macleod was to Africa as Mountbatten had been to India&quot;. Vernon Bogdanor has called him the greatest of Britain&#x27;s colonial secretaries apart from Joseph Chamberlain.

During his period as Colonial Secretary, Macleod ordered the systematic destruction of colonial papers and evidence detailing criminal acts committed during the 1940s and 1950s, for fear that they would fall into the hands of post-independence governments. This was done partly to avoid potential embarrassment to Britain, and partly to protect natives who had cooperated with the British. Many documents related to the brutal suppression of the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya.

===Books===
In 1961, Macleod published a sympathetic biography of former prime minister Neville Chamberlain, whose reputation then stood at a very low ebb because of recent memories of the Munich Agreement. The book was largely ghostwritten by Peter Goldman, whose own promising political career would be aborted when he lost the Orpington by-election the following year. Macleod was most interested in social policy and had most input into the parts up to 1931, including Chamberlain&#x27;s time as Lord Mayor of Birmingham and as Minister of Health. It had been intended as a potboiler to earn money for his daughter&#x27;s social season, and Macleod had been reluctant to read seven boxes of papers from Chamberlain&#x27;s sister Hilda (Chamberlain&#x27;s letters to whom are an important primary source); it added little to the portrait painted by his official biographer Keith Feiling.

Macleod used government papers in breach of the &quot;Fifty-year rule&quot; then in operation. Cabinet Secretary Sir Norman Brook persuaded the Prime Minister to demand amendments to conceal the degree of Cabinet involvement in the abdication of King Edward VIII (who was still alive in 1961) and the degree to which the civil servants Horace Wilson and Warren Fisher had demanded that the former King &quot;reorder his private life&quot; afterwards. Former prime minister Lord Avon, who cherished his (somewhat exaggerated) reputation as an opponent of &quot;appeasement&quot;, complained that such a book by a serving Cabinet Minister might be thought to express official sympathy for Chamberlain&#x27;s policies. Downing Street had to brief the press that Macleod had written purely in a personal capacity; Shepherd suggests that Macleod&#x27;s loss of favour with Macmillan, who had also been an opponent of appeasement, was accelerated by this episode. Robert Blake wrote in his review in &quot;The Times&quot; (26 November 1961) that &quot;when national security is at stake one does not judge a statesman by his successes at slum clearance&quot;. Macleod later told Alan Watkins (in &quot;Brief Lives&quot; 1982) &quot;It was a bad book. I made a great mistake in writing it. It made me no money, and it has done me a lot of harm&quot;. Watkins conceded that the book &quot;had been grudgingly and meanly reviewed&quot;. The book &quot;sold poorly and was soon forgotten&quot;.

Macleod contracted to write a second book (due for September 1962, but postponed), called &quot;The Last Rung&quot;, on leading politicians who had failed to achieve prime ministerial office despite being widely expected to do so. He completed chapters on Austen Chamberlain, Lord Curzon and Lord Halifax, and planned to write a chapter about Rab Butler.

=== Leader of the House and Party Chairman, 1961–63 ===
In October 1961, to appease Conservative right-wingers and dampen down an area of political controversy, Macmillan replaced Macleod as Colonial Secretary with Reginald Maudling, a much more emollient figure. Macleod replaced his old mentor Rab Butler as Leader of the House of Commons and Chairman of the Conservative Party organisation. There was something of a conflict of interest between these two jobs as the former, which Butler would have liked to retain, required its incumbent to retain good professional relations with the Labour Party so as to keep the Parliamentary timetable running smoothly, whereas the latter required him to play a leading role in partisan campaigning. In order that he could have a salary he was also given the sinecure post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a less prestigious office than the other sinecures of Lord Privy Seal or Lord President of the Council.

Macleod&#x27;s party chairmanship coincided with Selwyn Lloyd&#x27;s tight economic policies, and poor by-election results, most notably Orpington in March 1962. He impressed on Macmillan the need for a major reshuffle in 1962, and recommended the dismissal of Selwyn Lloyd from the Exchequer although he did not have in mind anything as drastic as the &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot; in which Macmillan sacked a third of his Cabinet. With the political scandals of 1962–63 (Vassall, Profumo) the Conservatives sank ever lower in the opinion polls.

===Conservative leadership contest, 1963===
Harold Macmillan resigned as prime minister in October 1963. Despite Macleod&#x27;s ability, as a result of his difficult term as Party Chairman, and memories of his time as Colonial Secretary, he was not a realistic candidate for the succession.

Macleod believed that the Earl of Home (later Sir Alec Douglas-Home after he had disclaimed his peerage) had behaved with less than complete honesty. He had initially appeared to rule himself out and had offered to help sample Cabinet opinion, before announcing his own candidacy. Macleod did not initially take Home&#x27;s candidacy seriously, and did not realise the degree to which Macmillan was promoting it. When first told by his PPS Reginald Bennett that Home might be a candidate for the succession, Macleod snapped &quot;Don&#x27;t talk nonsense&quot; and &quot;absolute rot; it&#x27;s not a possibility.&quot; Macleod gave his usual excellent conference speech at Blackpool on 11 October, unlike Maudling and Butler, who damaged their leadership chances by giving poor speeches, but Home&#x27;s leadership bandwagon grew despite a mediocre but rapturously received speech.

When the results of the &quot;customary processes&quot; became known on 17 October (the &quot;key day&quot; as Macleod later called it), Macleod was, along with Enoch Powell, Lord Hailsham and Reginald Maudling, angered at the supposed choice of Home. Macleod thought the new prime minister should be a &quot;moderniser&quot;, with views on the liberal wing of the party, and in the House of Commons. They attempted in vain to persuade Butler, Macmillan&#x27;s deputy (who Macleod had assumed would succeed him) not to serve in any Home cabinet, in the hope that this would prevent Home from forming a government. Macleod and Powell eventually refused to serve under Home as prime minister. He wrote of Enoch Powell&#x27;s decision not to serve &quot;One does not expect to have many people with one in the last ditch&quot;.

Lord Dilhorne, who had polled the Cabinet for their preferences, had listed Macleod as &quot;voting&quot; for Home. Some have seen this as a mistake, others as evidence that the consultation process was heavily rigged (i.e. that anybody who expressed the slightest willingness to serve under Home as a compromise if necessary was listed as &quot;supporting&quot; him). Macmillan&#x27;s official biographer Alistair Horne believed that Macleod&#x27;s description of 17 October as &quot;the key day&quot; is evidence that he &quot;changed his mind&quot;, having not previously had a particularly firm opinion. Macmillan&#x27;s view was &quot;well, you know … Macleod was a Highlander!&quot; Others (e.g. Macmillan&#x27;s biographer D. R. Thorpe) have suggested that Macleod actually &quot;did&quot; express a tactical preference for Home, in the hope of bringing about a deadlock in which he would enjoy bargaining power, or perhaps even become prime minister himself, and that his subsequent anger was a result of guilt that he had helped to bring about a Home &quot;victory&quot;.

Butler himself observed that &quot;Macleod was very shifty, much more so than you think&quot;. Nigel Lawson, later to succeed Macleod as editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, believed Macleod was &quot;too clever by three quarters&quot;. &quot;His petulant refusal to serve under Home and the extended explanation he gave for it both deprived the government of its most effective political street fighter and undermined the new prime minister&#x27;s legitimacy&quot; (&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, 3 October 2004). However, Lord Aldington, David Eccles, Sir Michael Fraser and Eve Macleod all rejected this interpretation of Macleod&#x27;s actions. Ian Gilmour argues that Macleod&#x27;s subsequent refusal to serve under Home makes it &quot;inconceivable&quot; that he had voted for him.

Macleod&#x27;s daughter Diana nearly died from appendicitis in October 1963, and it has been suggested that this may have affected his judgement. Nigel Fisher believed that Macleod had &quot;some inner sourness&quot; in 1963, attributable only in part to his daughter&#x27;s serious illness, and largely to the fact that he himself was not being considered as a candidate. Roy Jenkins concurs.

Had he become prime minister, Butler had planned to make Macleod Chancellor of the Exchequer and had discussed the names of economists who could be asked to advise. Butler later wrote &quot;I cannot help thinking that a man who always held all the bridge scores in his head, who seemed to know all the numbers, and played Vingt-et-un so successfully would have been useful&quot;.

===&quot;The Spectator&quot;===
Ian Gilmour appointed him editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;. He wrote his own weekly column under the pseudonym of &quot;Quoodle&quot; and also sometimes wrote signed articles complaining about what the ODNB describes as his &quot;pet hates&quot; such as Harold Wilson or the BBC. He tolerated a range of political opinions amongst his journalists, including Alan Watkins.

On 17 January 1964 Macleod published a candid account of the 1963 party leadership contest, claiming that it was a conspiracy by an Etonian &quot;magic circle&quot;. Macleod&#x27;s article was written as a review of a book by Randolph Churchill, which he described as &quot;Mr Macmillan&#x27;s trailer for the screenplay of his memoirs&quot;. In his posthumously published book &quot;The Art of Memory&quot; (April 1982) Butler wrote that &quot;every word&quot; of the &quot;Spectator&quot; article &quot;is true&quot;. Ian Gilmour also suggests that Dilhorne&#x27;s refusal to speak out against Macleod in January 1964, when Macleod&#x27;s credibility was at a low ebb, is strong evidence that Dilhorne knew his figures to be suspect.

Macmillan&#x27;s biographer D. R. Thorpe does not accept Macleod&#x27;s analysis, arguing that Home was well ahead of Butler in Cabinet preferences if Dilhorne&#x27;s official figures are to be believed (although he accepts that Edward Boyle&#x27;s preference was misrecorded as being for Home rather than Butler), and also criticises Macleod for only taking the preferences of the Cabinet into account, not those of junior ministers and backbenchers who were also polled.

After the &quot;Spectator&quot; article Macleod was censured by 15 votes to 14 (with 7 abstentions) by his local Conservative Association Executive Committee, but survived a No Confidence vote by 29 votes to 7. Peregrine Worsthorne attacked him as a social climber who had done his best to climb into the class at which he now sneered (e.g. by becoming a member of White&#x27;s Club), but his biographer comments that a Conservative politician of that era had little option but to play the game by those social rules, and that Macleod had regarded himself as &quot;commander class&quot; since his time at Staff College during the war. Colleagues &quot;cut&quot; Macleod in the House of Commons after the article and the affair permanently damaged his chances of becoming leader. Macmillan later advised Home, if asked why the Conservatives could not find a prime minister in the Commons and had had to appoint a Lord, to retort that &quot;The Spectator&quot; could not find an editor from amongst the journalists&#x27; profession and had instead had to appoint Iain Macleod.

On the twentieth anniversary of D-Day Macleod wrote a &quot;Spectator&quot; article about his experiences (5 June 1964).

Macleod also became a non-executive director of Lombards Bank, which allowed him a chauffeur-driven car, which he needed as his spinal disability—he was increasingly unable to move his back or neck—meant that he was no longer able to drive. Roy Jenkins recalled him arriving at Parliament and stepping out of his large car &quot;like a discontented gnome&quot; stepping out a &quot;golden coach&quot;.

===Shadow Chancellor===
Macleod returned to the shadow cabinet under Home following the 1964 election. His remit of opposing steel nationalisation came to naught as given his tiny majority Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson did not proceed with this measure. Macleod&#x27;s speech opposing steel nationalisation had been trailed as his comeback to frontline politics, but in the event was a damp squib. Nigel Fisher wrote that it was the only really bad speech of his career. Macleod did not contest the first ever Conservative Party leadership election in 1965, but backed Edward Heath, whom he did not particularly like but thought would be a better leader than Maudling. He expected to have received 40–45 votes had he stood.

The coinage of the word &quot;stagflation&quot; is attributed to him. Speaking in the House of Commons on 17 November 1965, he said: &quot;We now have the worst of both worlds — not just inflation on the one side or stagnation on the other, but both of them together. We have a sort of &#x27;stagflation&#x27; situation. And history, in modern terms, is indeed being made.&quot;

Macleod opposed the death penalty and supported legalisation of abortion and homosexuality; this did not help his acceptance by the more right-wing elements of his own party at the time. Macleod established good personal relations with several of his Labour opposite numbers, including both Bevan and James Callaghan, even though he clashed with Callaghan numerous times at the despatch box while serving as Shadow Chancellor in the 1960s (by contrast, he did not get on with Callaghan&#x27;s successor as chancellor, Roy Jenkins, considering him vain and arrogant).

As Shadow Chancellor he concentrated on tax reform. Jenkins, Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, wrote that he was never intimidated by him, and that Macleod concentrated on opposition rather than constructive proposals. Macleod planned to abolish Selective Employment Tax and to cut personal income tax, but not to increase indirect taxes, trusting that economic growth would make up the shortfall in revenue. He proposed a national lottery then opposed Jenkins when he proposed one; on another occasion he required Conservative MPs, to the irritation of some of them, to walk out of a select committee meeting in protest. Jenkins later recorded that Macleod was not &quot;an amiable &quot;shadow&quot; ... no doubt he was in pain ... Perhaps he also had a premonition that time was running out for him.&quot;

As Shadow Chancellor in 1967 Iain Macleod helped to found the homeless charity Crisis. In 1968 Macleod defied a decision of the Shadow Cabinet by voting against the Labour Government&#x27;s Commonwealth Immigration Bill, believing it to be a breach of promises made by the Conservative Government to the Kenyan Asians. He fell out with his former friend Enoch Powell over the latter&#x27;s 1968 Rivers of Blood speech, after which Macleod refused to speak to Powell again. Macleod&#x27;s subsequent dealings with him were, Powell said, as if he was a pariah though Macleod &#x27;knew what I said was not motivated by what is crudely called racialism, but he behaved as if he did not know&#x27;. Powell&#x27;s speech generated huge public support and Macleod was horrified at the open racism of many of the members of the public who wrote to him on the topic, likening them to the disgusting creatures which are revealed when one overturns a stone.

During this period Macleod was noted for his attacks on Wilson. He used to refer to Wilson as &quot;the little man&quot; even though Wilson was actually slightly taller than him. Some of Wilson&#x27;s entourage used to refer to Macleod as &quot;the poison dwarf&quot; but Wilson had, in the words of Macleod&#x27;s biographer, a &quot;wary respect&quot; for him. In the late 1960s he attacked Wilson in a public speech for accusing the Conservatives of being unpatriotic. He called Wilson &quot;a man whose vision is limited to tomorrow&#x27;s headline&quot; and, in an oft-quoted line, that whereas President Kennedy had called himself &quot;an idealist without illusions&quot; Wilson was &quot;an illusionist without ideals&quot;.

On 14 May 1970, in the House of Commons just before the General Election, when Wilson claimed that Conservative transport policies might result in an increase in children&#x27;s road deaths (Labour had recently introduced the breathalyzer), he attacked him for trying to make political capital from such a topic, and was rebuked by the Speaker for shouting abuse (the exact words are not recorded in &quot;Hansard&quot;; according to another MP he shouted &quot;swine!&quot;) at Wilson across the despatch box.

===Chancellor of the Exchequer and death===

On 20 June 1970, two days after the Conservative Party&#x27;s unexpected election victory, Macleod was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer by the new prime minister, Heath. Despite being in pain, he made his one and only major speech on the economy as chancellor on 7 July 1970. In the speech Macleod bemoaned the high level of inflation and, at the same time, the highest level of unemployment since 1940. Later that day he was rushed to hospital with what was thought at first to be appendicitis, but was in fact a pelvic diverticulum; He was discharged 11 days later. At 10.30 pm on 20 July, while in 11 Downing Street, he suffered a heart attack and died at 11.35 pm.

There seems little doubt that Macleod&#x27;s wartime injury had combined with his smoking and overwork to shorten his life. Newspaper boss Cecil King wrote in &quot;The Cecil King Diary 1970–1974&quot; that Macleod had been stricken during the 1960s by terminal cancer which had begun to affect his spine. However, Macleod&#x27;s own doctor, a Dr Forster, said there was no evidence that Macleod was suffering from cancer at the time of his death. At the subsequent by-election, Macleod was succeeded by Cecil Parkinson.

Macleod relied on Peter Walker for advice; Walker described him as not &quot;at ease on economics&quot;. He planned to hold down nationalised industry prices in an attempt to control inflation. Macleod bequeathed his successors a detailed plan for tax reform, much of which was put into action. He also left behind him an outline budget which some observers found surprisingly hard-line in its proposals for control of public spending. This included the proposal to abolish free school milk in primary schools, which new Education Secretary and future prime minister, Margaret Thatcher was able to partially reverse, reaching the compromise of only applying the cut to older primary school children; even so, she would come to be known as &quot;Margaret Thatcher, Milk Snatcher&quot;.

His death was a blow to the Heath government. Robert Carr described him as &quot;our trumpeter … any government needs a great trumpeter.&quot; Edmund Dell wrote: &quot;His death was a tragedy for the Conservative Party and possibly for the country. He was a man of considerable intellectual brilliance and one of the finest debaters in the House of Commons. He was the first professional gambler to become Chancellor…&quot; His successor Anthony Barber was much less of a political heavyweight, and Heath was able to dictate economic policy.

His opponent, Roy Jenkins, believed that he would not have been a great chancellor – with youthful memories of the unemployment of the 1930s and adult experience of the lower levels of the postwar era, Macleod thought unemployment higher than 300,000 was too high, and so would have had trouble adjusting to the new economic realities of the 1970s – but still would have been a better chancellor than Barber. He was already ill and old for his years, so would probably not have succeeded Heath as party leader, but might have prevented Thatcher from doing so.

==Oratory, personality and political views==
Many Conservative politicians of generations following Macleod recalled him as a highly effective speaker. His bald head and piercing gaze gave him a striking physical presence, and he was one of the most powerful platform speakers of his generation, in the league of Churchill or Aneurin Bevan. He was also a superb negotiator with a grasp of detail. Never one to suffer fools, by middle age his disability made him very short-tempered and impatient with people.

His political opponent Roy Jenkins later wrote that Macleod seemed to prefer to focus his attacks on more moderate Labour figures who might dispute the ownership of the centre ground with him. He wrote that Macleod had &quot;some quality of self-destructiveness in him&quot;. He wrote that there was a &quot;calculated coldness&quot; about his partisan attacks. Jenkins wrote that Macleod had &quot;a darting crossword-puzzle mind fortified by a phenomenal memory&quot; adding that &quot;I am not convinced that he was a particularly nice man, but he had insight and insolence&quot;. Jenkins likens him to Benjamin Disraeli or to George Canning, who by attracting the admiration of a clique of younger men left a legend out of all proportion to their actual achievements.

He commented about Labour parliamentarians under Hugh Gaitskell (opposition leader 1955–63) that, when offered their choice of weapons, they invariably chose boomerangs. It is said that Macleod was the only Conservative debater whom Harold Wilson, Gaitskell&#x27;s successor as Labour leader, was afraid of. Wilson declared &quot;they&#x27;ll never have the sense to choose him [as leader].&quot; He compared Wilson to a kipper, which has two faces. John Major specifically cited Macleod&#x27;s example on taking office.

Macleod believed that his political views were a mixture of those of his Liberal father and Conservative mother. He almost always called himself a &quot;Tory&quot; rather than a &quot;Conservative&quot;. He believed in equality of opportunity rather than of outcome, and wrote that his ideal was &quot;to see that men had an equal chance to make themselves unequal&quot;.

He is credited with inventing the term &quot;the nanny state&quot;.

==Family==

Macleod met Evelyn Hester Mason, &quot;née&quot; Blois, (1915–1999) in September 1939 whilst he was waiting to be called up for army service and she interviewed him for a job as an ambulance driver. Evelyn was daughter of Rev. Gervase Vanneck Blois, rector of Hanbury, Worcestershire – himself son of Sir John Blois, 8th Baronet- and his wife Hester, whose father was Herbert Pakington, 3rd Baron Hampton. Alan Watkins, in &quot;Brief Lives&quot; (1982) observed in his portrait of Macleod that he &quot;was always quite proud of his wife&#x27;s comparatively exalted social connection&quot; After her first husband was killed in the war, they married on 25 January 1941. The Macleods had a son and a daughter, Torquil and Diana, who were born in 1942 and 1944 respectively. They had a somewhat stormy marriage in which they retained a strong bond despite Macleod conducting a number of what his biographer describes as &quot;romances&quot; with other women (he quotes love letters written by Macleod but does not specifically say they went as far as sexual affairs). As was common for MPs&#x27; wives of the era, Eve looked after constituency matters whilst her husband concentrated on his career at Westminster.

Evelyn Macleod was struck down in June 1952 with meningitis and polio, but subsequently managed to walk again with the aid of sticks and worked hard to support her husband&#x27;s career. After her husband&#x27;s death she accepted a peerage in 1971 and took her seat in the House of Lords as Baroness Macleod of Borve. Macleod&#x27;s daughter Diana Heimann was a UK Independence Party candidate at Banbury in the 2005 general election.

Macleod is buried in the churchyard of Gargrave Church in North Yorkshire, near his mother who had died seven weeks earlier.

His estate was valued for probate at £18,201 (around £250,000 at 2016 prices).

<text>Theda Bara ( ; born Theodosia Burr Goodman; July 29, 1885 – April 7, 1955) was an American silent film and stage actress. Bara was one of the more popular actresses of the silent era and one of cinema&#x27;s early sex symbols. Her femme fatale roles earned her the nickname &quot;The Vamp&quot; (short for &quot;vampire&quot;, here meaning a seductive woman), later fueling the rising popularity in &quot;vamp&quot; roles based in exoticism and sexual domination.

Born to a Jewish family in Cincinnati, Bara was the biggest star of Fox Studios, who prompted a fictitious persona for her as an Egyptian-born woman interested in the occult. She made more than 40 films between 1914 and 1926, most of which were lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire. She left Fox in 1919 and was unable to recapture her previous success. After her marriage to Charles Brabin in 1921, she made two more films and then retired from acting in 1926. Bara never appeared in any sound films.

==Early life==
Bara was born Theodosia Burr Goodman on July 29, 1885, in Cincinnati, Ohio. She was named after the daughter of U.S. Vice President Aaron Burr. Her father was Bernard Goodman (1853–1936), a prosperous Jewish tailor from Poland. Her mother, Pauline Louise Françoise ( de Coppett; 1861–1957), was born in Switzerland. Bernard and Pauline married in 1882. Theda had two younger siblings: Marque (1888–1954) and Esther (1897–1965), who went by the nickname &quot;Lori&quot;.

In 1890 the family moved to Avondale, a Cincinnati suburb with a substantial Jewish community. Bara attended Walnut Hills High School, graduating in 1903. After attending the University of Cincinnati for two years, she worked mainly in local theater productions, but did explore other projects. After moving to New York City in 1908, she made her Broadway debut the same year in &quot;The Devil&quot;.

==Career==
Most of Bara&#x27;s early films were shot along the East Coast, where the film industry was based, primarily at Fox Studios in Fort Lee, New Jersey. She lived with her family in New York City. The rise of Hollywood as the center of the American film industry forced her to move to Los Angeles to film the epic &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1917), which became one of her biggest hits. No complete prints of &quot;Cleopatra&quot; are known to exist today, but numerous photographs of her in costume as Cleopatra have survived. 
Bara was the Fox studio&#x27;s biggest star between 1915 and 1919, but tired of being typecast as a vamp, she allowed her five-year contract with the company to expire. Her final Fox film was &quot;The Lure of Ambition&quot; (1919). In 1920, she turned briefly to the stage, appearing on Broadway in &quot;The Blue Flame&quot;. Bara&#x27;s fame drew large crowds to the theater, but her acting was savaged by critics.
Her career suffered without Fox Studios&#x27; support, and she did not make another film until &quot;The Unchastened Woman&quot; (1925) for Chadwick Pictures. She retired after making only one more film, the short comedy &quot;Madame Mystery&quot; (1926), directed by Stan Laurel for Hal Roach; in this, Bara parodied her vamp image.
At the height of her fame, Bara earned $4,000 per week (). Her better-known roles were as the &quot;vamp&quot;, although she attempted to avoid typecasting by playing wholesome heroines in films such as &quot;Under Two Flags&quot; and &quot;Her Double Life&quot;. She appeared as Juliet in a version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Although Bara took her craft seriously, she was too successful playing exotic wanton women to develop a more versatile career.

===Image and name===

The origin of Bara&#x27;s stage name is disputed. &quot;The Guinness Book of Movie Facts and Feats&quot; says it came from director Frank Powell, who learned Theda had a relative named Baranger, and that Theda was a childhood nickname. In promoting the 1917 film &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, Fox Studio publicists noted that the name was an anagram of &quot;Arab death&quot;, and her press agents, to enhance her exotic appeal to moviegoers, falsely promoted the young Ohio native as &quot;the daughter of an Arab sheik and a French woman, born in the Sahara&quot;. In 1917, the Goodman family legally changed its surname to Bara.

==Personal==
Bara was known for wearing very revealing costumes in her films. It was popular at that time to promote an actress as mysterious, with an exotic background. The studios promoted Bara with a massive publicity campaign, billing her as the Egyptian-born daughter of a French actress and an Italian sculptor. They claimed she had spent her early years in the Sahara desert under the shadow of the Sphinx, then moved to France to become a stage actress. (In fact, Bara never had been to Egypt, and her time in France amounted to just a few months.)

A 2016 book by Joan Craig and Beverly F. Stout chronicles many personal, first-hand accounts of the lives of Bara and her husband Charles Brabin.

==Marriage and retirement==

Bara married British-born American film director Charles Brabin in 1921. They honeymooned at The Pines Hotel in Digby, Nova Scotia, Canada, and later purchased a property down the coast from Digby at Harbourville, Nova Scotia, overlooking the Bay of Fundy, eventually building a summer home they called Baranook. They had no children. Bara resided in a villa-style home in Cincinnati, which served as the &quot;honors villa&quot; at Xavier University. Demolition of the home began in July 2011.

In 1936, she appeared on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; during a broadcast version of &quot;The Thin Man&quot; with William Powell and Myrna Loy. She did not appear in the play but instead announced her plans to make a movie comeback, which never materialized. She appeared on radio again in 1939 as a guest on &quot;Texaco Star Theatre&quot;.

In 1949, producer Buddy DeSylva and Columbia Pictures expressed interest in making a movie of Bara&#x27;s life, to star Betty Hutton, but the project never materialized.

==Death==
On April 7, 1955, after a lengthy stay at California Lutheran Hospital in Los Angeles, Bara died of stomach cancer. She was survived by her husband, her mother, and her younger sister, Lori. She was interred as Theda Bara Brabin at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Bara bequeathed $100,000 to her sister, $8,000 to her husband, and $1,000 to her sister-in-law.

==Legacy==
Bara often is cited as the first sex symbol of the film era.

For her contributions to the film industry, Bara received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. Her star is located at 6307 Hollywood Boulevard, and is shown in the film &quot;MaXXXine&quot;.

Bara never appeared in a sound film, lost or otherwise. A 1937 fire at Fox&#x27;s nitrate film storage vaults in New Jersey destroyed most of that studio&#x27;s silent films. Bara made more than 40 films between 1914 and 1926, but complete prints of only six still exist: &quot;The Stain&quot; (1914), &quot;A Fool There Was&quot; (1915), &quot;East Lynne&quot; (1916), &quot;The Unchastened Woman&quot; (1925), and two short comedies for Hal Roach. In addition to these, a few of her films remain in fragments, including &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (less than a minute of footage), a clip thought to be from &quot;The Soul of Buddha&quot;, and a few other unidentified clips featured in the documentary &quot;Theda Bara et William Fox&quot; (2001). Most of the clips can be seen in the documentary &quot;The Woman with the Hungry Eyes&quot; (2006).

As to vamping, critics stated that her portrayal of calculating, cold-hearted women was morally instructive to men. Bara responded by saying &quot;I will continue doing vampires as long as people sin.&quot; Additional footage has been found which shows her behind the scenes on a picture. While the hairstyle has led some to theorize that this may be from &quot;The Lure of Ambition&quot;, this has not been confirmed. Small fragments from &quot;Salomé&quot; were discovered in 2021 by an intern at Filmoteca Española.

In 1994, she was honored with her image on a U.S. postage stamp designed by caricaturist Al Hirschfeld. The Fort Lee Film Commission dedicated Main Street and Linwood Avenue in Fort Lee, New Jersey, as &quot;Theda Bara Way&quot; in May 2006 to honor Bara, who made many of her films at the Fox Studio on Linwood and Main.

Over a period of several years, filmmaker and film historian Phillip Dye reconstructed &quot;Cleopatra&quot; on video. Titled &quot;Lost Cleopatra&quot;, the full-length feature was created by editing together production-still picture montages combined with the surviving film clip. The script was based on the original scenario, with modifications derived from research into censorship reports, reviews of the film, and synopses from period magazines. Dye screened the film at the Hollywood Heritage Museum on February 8, 2017.

==Cultural references==
* The short piano suite &quot;Silhouettes from the Screen&quot;, Op. 55 (1919) by Mortimer Wilson includes a miniature musical portrait of Theda Bara, who is portrayed in an atonal, expressionistic style.
* Bara is referenced in the 1921 Bert Kalmar/Harry Ruby song &quot;Rebecca Came Back from Mecca&quot; as well as their 1922 &quot;Sheik From Avenue B,&quot; sung by Fanny Brice.
* Bara was one of three actresses (Pola Negri and Mae Murray were the others) whose eyes were combined to form the Chicago International Film Festival&#x27;s logo, a stark, black and white close up of the composite eyes set as repeated frames in a strip of film.
* The &quot;International Times&quot;″ logo is a black-and-white image of Theda Bara. The founders&#x27; intention had been to use an image of actress Clara Bow, 1920s &quot;It girl&quot;, but a picture of Theda Bara was used by accident, and once deployed, not changed.
* During a scene from The Aviator (2004 film) when Howard Hughes and Glenn Odekirk are trying to create the H-1 Racer, Odekirk remarks, &quot;Yeah, well, I want a date with Theda Bara, but that ain&#x27;t gonna happen either.&quot;
* Bara, as well as the lost Cleopatra (1917 film), are referenced extensively in the romance novel Nevaeh Smiled by SPW Mitchell as the muse for costume designer Rainier.
* There are multiple references to Bara in the X film series. In the 2022 film Pearl, the titular character, portrayed by Mia Goth, feeds an alligator that she has named Theda. In the 2024 film Maxxxine, the titular character, also portrayed by Goth, is seen putting out her cigarette on the Theda Bara Hollywood Walk of Fame star.
* Bara is a central figure in the play &quot;On Set with Theda Bara&quot;, written by Joey Merlo, directed by Jack Serio, and performed by David Greenspan at the Brick Theater in New York in 2024.

<doc id="242798" wikidata="Q1050652" url="?curid=242798" title="List of defunct and relocated National Hockey League teams">
<text>The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional men&#x27;s ice hockey league, founded in 1917. The NHL Board of Governors review and approve the relocation of any member club. Each team appoints an individual or individuals to represent their team on the Board of Governors. A majority vote is needed for relocation of a club. Clubs are considered permanently relocated when moved out of their respective home territories, which includes the city that they were located in, plus 50 miles from the city&#x27;s corporate limits.

Under the constitution of the NHL, membership is on a partnership basis, each partner holding a franchise from the League for the operation of a hockey club in its designated city. The franchise can out-live teams located in different cities. For example, the Kansas City Scouts, Colorado Rockies, and New Jersey Devils are one franchise. A franchise&#x27;s history includes the records of competition won in different cities, as differently-named teams. Naming and team logos and designs are registered with the league. Two current teams use the names of previous franchises – the Ottawa Senators and Winnipeg Jets. These franchises do not include the history of the previous franchises, but have used the original franchises&#x27; logos and jersey designs. The league considers the history of the current Ottawa Senators to not include the original Senators; the Jets&#x27; franchise history includes the Atlanta Thrashers&#x27; history, not the first Winnipeg Jets (later the Arizona Coyotes).

There are 19 defunct and relocated NHL teams. The Montreal Wanderers, original Ottawa Senators, and the Quebec Bulldogs had played in the NHA before joining the NHL; Quebec City joined the NHL two years later as the Athletics. The Pittsburgh Pirates played in the U.S. Amateur Hockey Association as the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets before joining the NHL in 1925. The first NHL team to disband was the Montreal Wanderers, citing the lack of available players due to World War I. The first team to relocate was the Athletics, who relocated to Hamilton, Ontario, to become the Hamilton Tigers. The NHL president at the time, Frank Calder, stripped the franchise from owner Mike Quinn and sold it to a Hamilton-based company. Three franchises became defunct due to the Great Depression: the Philadelphia Quakers, the St. Louis Eagles, and the Montreal Maroons. During their time in the NHL, the Senators and Maroons both won the Stanley Cup championship multiple times, with four and two respectively. The Brooklyn Americans was the last team to become defunct in the NHL. The franchise was struggling financially and, due to the lack of players because of World War II, was suspended prior to the . The franchise formally ceased in 1946. The Americans&#x27; departure reduced the number of teams to six. This began what became known as the Original Six era of the NHL.

The Original Six era ended when the NHL expanded twofold in 1967. Two teams from the expansion—the California Golden Seals and the Minnesota North Stars—relocated to other cities. The Golden Seals moved after nine seasons in Oakland to become the Cleveland Barons; this was the first time in four decades the NHL approved a franchise relocation. Two years later, after failed overtures towards merging with the Washington Capitals and the Vancouver Canucks, the Barons merged with the North Stars. The Barons are the only NHL team to merge operations with another one. The North Stars relocated to Dallas in 1993 to become the Stars.

After six additional expansion teams, the merger of the Cleveland Barons with the Minnesota North Stars, and the NHL–WHA merger, the league had expanded to 21 teams by 1979. Three of the four teams from the NHL–WHA merger relocated to other cities: the Quebec Nordiques, the original Winnipeg Jets, and the Hartford Whalers. The Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche in 1995, while the Winnipeg Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996 and rebranded as the Arizona Coyotes in 2014 (but then becoming defunct in 2024), with the Hartford Whalers moving to North Carolina and becoming the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997. The Winnipeg Jets identity was revived in 2011, when a Winnipeg-based company received approval from the league to purchase the struggling Atlanta Thrashers and relocate them to Winnipeg for the .

In a unique situation in 2024, the Arizona Coyotes was deactivated and its players and personnel were transferred to a new expansion team in Utah. Under the original agreement, Coyotes owner Alex Meruelo retained the rights to the team name and history, as well as an option for reactivation in Arizona for five years, under the condition a new arena is completed in that time. However he ceded his rights to the franchise less than two months later. , the league has not yet indicated whether the Arizona franchise will now fold outright, hold the rights to the Coyotes and wait for a potential expansion team, and/or whether its history, records and/or intellectual property will be transferred to the Utah Hockey Club and/or split between Utah and the current Winnipeg Jets.

Out of the seven active relocated franchises in the NHL, only one has not yet won the Stanley Cup championship, the Jets (they have also never been to the Stanley Cup Finals).

Most of the metropolitan areas that have hosted relocated or defunct teams have been given another NHL team. Montreal, Quebec City and Atlanta all have two defunct or relocated teams with the Wanderers and Maroons, the Athletics and Nordiques, and the Flames and Thrashers, respectively. Philadelphia (Philadelphia Flyers), Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh Penguins), and St. Louis (St. Louis Blues) gained teams during the 1967 expansion. After losing the Americans, two more teams have been added into the New York metropolitan area: the New York Islanders in 1972 and the New Jersey Devils in 1982. Other former host-metropolitan areas of NHL teams that have been given another team include: San Francisco Bay Area (San Jose Sharks in 1991), Ottawa (current Ottawa Senators in 1992), Denver (Colorado Avalanche in 1995), Minneapolis – St. Paul (Minnesota Wild in 2000) and Winnipeg (current Jets in 2011).

<doc id="242801" wikidata="Q6942303" url="?curid=242801" title="Music of Trinidad and Tobago">
<text>The music of Trinidad and Tobago is best known for its calypso music, soca music, chutney music, and steelpan. Calypso&#x27;s internationally noted performances in the 1950s from native artists such as Lord Melody, Lord Kitchener and Mighty Sparrow. The art form was most popularised at that time by Harry Belafonte. Along with folk songs and African- and Indian-based classical forms, cross-cultural interactions have produced other indigenous forms of music including soca, rapso, parang, chutney, and other derivative and fusion styles. There are also local communities which practice and experiment with international classical and pop music, often fusing them with local steelpan instruments.

MusicTT was established in 2014 to facilitate the business development and export activity of the music industry in Trinidad and Tobago.

==History==
The Cedula of Population of 1783 laid the foundation and growth of the population of Trinidad. The island&#x27;s Spanish possessors contributed little towards advancements, with El Dorado the focus; Trinidad&#x27;s geographical location made it the center of that focus. Following the Cedula, French planters (accompanied by their slaves, free coloreds and mulattos) from the French Antilles of Martinique, Grenada, Guadeloupe and Dominica migrated to the Trinidad. This exodus was encouraged due to the French Revolution. The Spanish also gave many incentives to lure settlers to the island, including exemption from taxes for 10 years and land grants in accordance to the terms set out in the Cedula. These new immigrants established local communities of Blanchisseuse, Champs Fleurs, Paramin, Cascade, Carenage and Laventille. Trinidad&#x27;s population jumped from less than 1,400 in 1777, to over 15,000 by the end of 1789. In 1797, Trinidad became a British crown colony, with a French-speaking population.

Carnival had arrived with the French. Indentured laborers and slaves, who could not take part in Carnival, formed their own, parallel celebration, canboulay, which became the precursor for the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Carnival, and has played an important role in the development of Trinidad&#x27;s culture.

Official and elite unease over carnival revelry (which was considered violent and unruly) grew during the next few decades, and in 1883 drumming was banned in an attempt to clean up Carnival. This injunction came after a serious disturbance during the 1881 Carnival, known as the Canboulay Riots. Canboulays were processions during carnival that commemorated the harvesting of burnt cane fields during slavery, a process so labor-intensive that it had often involved forced marches of slaves from neighboring plantations to more efficiently harvest the cane (once the field is burned, the cane requires immediate harvesting, or it spoils). These canboulay processions were popular, and often incorporated kalenda. The government&#x27;s attempt to ban the processions in 1881 resulted in open riots between Afro-Creole revelers and police, a turn of events that, not surprisingly, caused deep resentment within Trinidadian society toward the government&#x27;s use of power. The open resistance of Afro-Creole revelers, of course, redoubled concerns among government officials over this potential threat to public order and led to an alternative strategy—the banning of drumming—in 1883. To make sure that the point got across, stick-fighting itself was banned in 1884. An ingenious substitute for the drums and sticks, called tamboo bamboo, was introduced in the 1890s.

Tamboo-bamboo bands consist of three different instruments (each cut from bamboo): boom, foulé, and cutter. The boom serves as the bass instrument, is usually about five feet long, and is played by stamping it on the ground. The foulé, a higher-pitched instrument, consists of two pieces of bamboo, each about a foot long, and is played by striking these pieces end to end. The cutter, the highest-pitched instrument in the ensemble, is made from a thinner piece of bamboo (of varying length) and is struck with a stick. These three types of instruments combined to beat out rhythms that accompanied the chantwells and were a staple of carnival celebrations for many years. They were gradually rendered obsolete by the steel band.

The 1930s saw contests between tents become a standard part of Carnival, and in 1939, Growling Tiger was crowned the first calypso monarch of Trinidad (for his song, &quot;The Labor Situation in Trinidad&quot;). Carnival festivities split into two kinds of venues during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, occupying both the street and more performance-oriented calypso tents. Both of these spaces, however, were the preserve of the lower class and of Afro-Creoles. Calypsonians were considered potentially dangerous by elites and government officials because they commanded large followings and could sway public opinion with their songs. The streets were also carefully monitored, setting up an atmosphere within which calypso and Carnival were embraced by the lower class and kept at a distance by elites. The Afro-Creole middle class, moreover, working toward upward social mobility and thus concerned with aligning itself with the elite, also attempted to distance itself from Carnival and calypso.

Beginning in 1845, major influxes of indentured immigrants from India and other parts of the world dramatically changed the ethnic composition of the islands. These indentured servants brought their own folk music, primarily from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, to the creole mix, resulting in chutney music. In addition to Indians, Syrians, Portuguese, Chinese and Africans came to the islands in waves between 1845 and 1917, and even after.

==Folk traditions==
Recorded in the hills of Trinidad, here is a fascinating juxtaposition of three music and music / dance practices of non-urban dwellers derived from African roots. Bamboo-Tamboo evolved out of the ban which European colonizers imposed on drumming: dry, hollow bamboo poles were cut to varying lengths to produce different pitches when thumped theground. These bamboo instruments are used to accompany or speak about calinda (stick fighting). Belair (bélé) is a dance of older women accompanied by drums and shakers

===Bélé===

In the late 18th century when the French plantation owners and their Creole slaves came to Trinidad and Tobago, they brought with them a life style of &quot;joie de vivre&quot; to their plantations. At that time, the French held many balls at the Great Houses where they enjoyed doing many of the courtly dances of Europe.

The house slaves, in their moments of leisure, took the dance to the field slaves and mimicked the dance of their masters. The slaves who worked in or around these houses quickly copied the style and dress. They showed off by doing ceremonious bows, making grand entrances, sweeping movements, graceful and gentle gliding steps which imitated the perceived elegance of the French. The rhythmic quality of the bélé drums added spicy and yet subtle sensuality to the movements. There are more than 14 types of bélé dances including the Grand bélé and Congo bélé, with each performed to its own rhythms and chants.

===Tamboo-bamboo===
Stick fighting and African percussion music were banned in 1881 from Trinidad Carnival, in response to the Canboulay Riots. They were replaced by bamboo sticks called &quot;tamboo-bamboo&quot; (originally tambour bamboo) beaten together, which were themselves banned in turn. Tamboo-bamboo evolved out of the ban which European colonizers imposed on drumming: dry, hollow bamboo poles were cut to varying lengths to produce different pitches when thumped against the ground. In 1937 they reappeared, transformed as an orchestra of frying pans, dustbin lids and oil drums. These steelpans or pans are now a major part of the Trinidadian music.

The first instruments developed in the evolution of steelpan were tamboo-bamboos, tunable sticks made of bamboo wood. Tamboo-bamboo bands also included percussion of a (gin) bottle and spoon. By the mid-1930s, bits of metal percussion were being used in the tamboo bamboo bands.

===Kaiso===

Kaiso is a type of music popular in Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Barbados, St. Lucia and Dominica. It originated from West African call and response songs, and later evolved into calypso music.

Kaiso music has its origins in West African call and response songs (particularly in present-day Nigeria) which were brought over by the slaves who (in the early history of the art form) used them to sing about their masters and ways to gain their freedom. The people would also gather in &quot;kaiso&quot; tents where a griot or lead singer would lead them in song. Many early kaisos were sung in French Creole by a &quot;chantwell&quot;. Kaiso songs are generally narrative in form and often have a cleverly concealed political subtext.

After Emancipation of slavery, the chantwell would sing call-and-response chants called &quot;lavways&quot;, lionizing and cheering on champion stickfighters. This form of music gradually evolved into the modern day calypso.

==Calypso==

Calypso music grew together with Carnival. The music drew upon the West African Kaiso and French/European influences, and arose as a means of communication among the enslaved Africans. &quot;Kaiso&quot; is still used today as a synonym for &quot;calypso&quot; in Trinidad and some other islands, often by traditionalists, and is also used as a cry of encouragement for a performer, similar to &quot;bravo&quot; or &quot;olé&quot;. Highly rhythmic and harmonic vocals characterized the music, which was most often sung in a French Creole and led by a griot. As calypso developed, the role of the griot (originally a similar traveling musician in West Africa) became known as a &quot;chantuelle&quot;, and eventually, &quot;calypsonian&quot;. Calypso was popularized after the abolition of slavery and the ensuing growth of the Carnival festivals in the 1830s.

Modern calypso, however, began in the 19th century, a fusion of disparate elements ranging from the masquerade song &quot;lavway&quot;, French Creole &quot;belair&quot; and the stick fighting chantwell. Calypso&#x27;s early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by Trinidadian slaves, including canboulay drumming and the music masquerade processions. The French brought Masquerade Balls to Trinidad which were mimicked by ex-slaves after Abolition of Slavery, and calypso competitions at Carnival grew in popularity, especially after the abolition of slavery in 1834.

Calypso drew upon African and French influences, and became the voice of the people. It allowed the masses to challenge the actions of the unelected Governor and Legislative Council, and the elected town councils of Port of Spain and San Fernando. As English replaced patois (French Creole) as the dominant language, calypso migrated into English, and in so doing it attracted more attention from the radio stations and government. Calypso continued to play an important role in political expression, and also served to document the history of Trinidad and Tobago.

===Early performers===
Early chantwells such as Hannibal, Norman Le Blanc, Mighty Panther and Boadicea made names for themselves by criticizing the colonial government. In 1912, calypso was recorded for the first time and the following decade saw the arrival of calypso tent. During Carnival, calypsonians competed for awards like the Carnival Road March, National Calypso Monarch, Calypso Queen, Junior Monarch and Extempo Monarch in contests called picong, when two performers trade bawdy and irreverent jibes at each other, and referencing the day&#x27;s events. Soon, stars such as Lord Invader and Roaring Lion grew in stature (the 1930s Golden Age of Calypso) and became more closely aligned with the independence movement. Some songs were banned or censored by the British colonial government, and calypso became a method of underground communication and spreading anti-British information.

These early popular performers led the way for calypso&#x27;s mainstreaming with artists including Lord Kitchener, Harry Belafonte and Mighty Sparrow. Belafonte, a Jamaican-American singing in American English, was by far the most popular internationally during this wave (with his &quot;Calypso&quot; album, Belafonte was the first artist to sell a million copies), but his music was also criticized for watering down the sound of calypso.

1947 saw Lord Kitchener and Killer forming the renegade calypso tent Young Brigade. The term &quot;Young Brigade&quot; soon came to refer to a specific group of calypsonians that used fictional narratives and humor with new, more dance-able rhythms. Kitchener was by far the most popular of the Young Brigade calypsonians, and he helped popularize calypso in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Mighty Sparrow&#x27;s first hit was &quot;Jean and Dinah&quot;, celebrating the departure of American military forces from Trinidad; the song launched a new generation of politically active calypso music, which soon became associated with the People&#x27;s National Movement. Roaring Lion was also a major part of this vanguard in calypso music, and he became known for a traditionalist style that he maintained throughout his career.

During the 1970s, calypso&#x27;s popularity waned throughout the world, including the Caribbean. Derivatives include an uptempo version of Calypso music called soca, and a hip-hop-influenced style called rapso both became popular in Trinidad and other islands. Soca was by the more influential in terms of international sales, since rapso&#x27;s crossover appeal to mainstream tastes has been extremely limited. Old-time calypsonians and purists, however, preferred rapso&#x27;s continuation of the lyrical ambidexterity that helped make calypso the world-famous, innovative art form it has become; many criticized soca&#x27;s perceived watering-down of calypso, including veteran calypsonians such as Chalkdust, who asked: &quot;Are we to put water in the brandy, singing just two or three words [that mainstream audiences] can understand and dance to?&quot; Indo-Trinidadians began popularising chutney music during the same time period. In the mid-1970s, artists like Sundar Popo made the music mainstream.

==The father of soca music==

The &quot;father&quot; of soca was a Trinidadian man named Garfield Blackman who rose to fame as &quot;Lord Shorty&quot; with his 1964 hit &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot; and took on the name &quot;Ras Shorty I&quot; in the early 1980s. He started out writing songs and performing in the calypso genre. A prolific musician, composer, and innovator, Shorty experimented with fusing calypso and elements of Indo-Caribbean music for nearly a decade from 1965 before unleashing &quot;the soul of calypso&quot;, soca music by the early 1970s.

Shorty was the first to define his music as &quot;soca&quot; during 1975 when his hit song “Endless Vibrations” was causing major musical waves on radio stations and at parties and clubs not just throughout his native T&amp;T but also in far-off metropolitan cities like New York, Toronto, and London. Soca was initially spelled Sokah which stands for the “Soul of Calypso” with the “Kah” part being taken from the first letter in the Sanskrit alphabet and representing the Power of movement as well as the East Indian rhythmic influence that helped to inspire the new soca beat. Shorty stated in several interviews that the idea for the new soca beat started with the rhythmic fusion of Calypso rhythms with East Indian rhythms that he used in his hit &quot;Indrani&quot; recorded in 1972. The soca beat was solidified as the popular new beat that most of the T&amp;T Calypso musicians would start adopting by the time Shorty had recorded his big crossover hit “Endless Vibrations” in 1974.

Shorty also recorded a mid-year album in 1975 called “Love In The Caribbean” that contains several crossover soca tracks before setting off on an album distribution and promotion tour. During his 1975 “Love In The Caribbean” album promotion and distribution tour, Shorty pass thru the isle of Dominica on his way back to Trinidad and saw Dominica&#x27;s top band Exile One perform at the Fort Young Hotel. Shorty was inspired to compose and record a Soca and Cadence-lypso fusion track called “E Pete” or “Ou Petit” which can be viewed as the first of its kind in that particular Soca style. Shorty sought and got help with the Creole lyrics he used in the chorus of his “E Pete” song by consulting with Dominica&#x27;s 1969 Calypso King, Lord Tokyo, and two creole lyricists, Chris Seraphine and Pat Aaron while he was in Dominica. The song “E Pete” thus contains genuine Creole lyrics in the chorus like &quot;Ou dee moin ou petit Shorty&quot; (meaning &quot;you told me you are small Shorty&quot;), and is a combination of Soca, Calypso, Cadence-lypso and Creole.

Shorty&#x27;s 1974 &quot;Endless Vibrations&quot; and &quot;Soul of Calypso&quot; brought Soca to be regional and international attention and fame and helped to solidify the rapidly growing Soca Movement led by Shorty.

Soca developed in the early 1970s and grew in popularity in the late 1970s. Soca&#x27;s development as a musical genre included its early fusion of calypso with Indian musical instruments, particularly the dholak, tabla, and dhantal, as demonstrated in Lord Shorty&#x27;s classic compositions &quot;Ïndrani&quot;, &quot;Kalo Gee Bull Bull&quot; and &quot;Shanti Om&quot;.

Soca has grown since its inception to incorporate elements of funk, soul, disco, zouk and other dance music genres, and continues to blend in contemporary music styles and trends. Soca has also been experimented with in Bollywood films, Bhangra, in new Punjabi pop, and in disco music in the United States.

==Rapso==

Rapso arose as Black Power and Pan-Africanist thought spread in Trinidad. Lancelot Layne is said to have invented the genre with his 1971 hit &quot;Blow Away&quot;, while Cheryl Byron brought rapso to calypso tents in 1976. The term &quot;rapso&quot; first appeared in 1980 on &quot;Busting Out&quot;, an album by Brother Resistance and his Network Riddum Band. Rapso has become one of the most prevalent expressions of music on Trinidad itself, but is largely absorbed into calypso during Carnival celebrations and contests. The 1990s saw a more politically and spiritually-conscious form of rapso, which has been infused with soul and reggae music, as well as native J&#x27;ouvert, an early introduction to Carnival which consists of percussionists using makeshift materials to hammer out a beat. The trio band 3 Canal, and the artist Ataklan, are among the most popular modern proponents.

==Extempo==

Extempo, or extempo calypso, or calypso war, is a lyrically improvised (freestyled) form of calypso. An annual competition is held at the Trinidad and Tobago Carnival for the title of Extempo Monarch. The art form was first recorded in the 1940s in Trinidad.

==Brass bands==
Starting in 1986, David Rudder popularized the brass band in Carnival competitions. Brass bands had long been a part of Trinidad&#x27;s cultural heritage, but Rudder helped inspire the founding of the Caribbean Brass Festival in 1991.

==Steel-pan and steel bands==

One of the most significant contributions of Trinidad and Tobago to the world of music was the invention of the steelpan. This instrument is the only acoustic instrument that was invented in the 20th century. The pan evolved from music which the island slaves created for the carnival festivities. The first steel-pans were made from oil drums. The players would beat on the end of the oil drum with bamboo to produce music and found that the areas of the drum that were hit the most frequently developed a higher pitch. From this discovery the players learned that they could change the pitch of the drum to create different notes.

The steel-pan is created by hammering a 55-gallon drum to produce the full chromatic range of scale notes. After the drum is hammered into the shape of a concave bowl, individual notes are grooved out into the bowl of the drum. The traditional steel-pan was hammered out by hand, but with the instrument gaining popularity and worldwide demand, manufacturers have experimented with more efficient methods including Spinforming, Flowforming, Aquaforming and Marforming. A typical pan contains 2 octaves, with each note being a hammered out groove in the pan that produces a distinct note.

Steel-pan originates from low-income communities and was at first associated with violence and lawlessness. The upper class looked on steel-pan players with disdain until Dr. Eric Williams, leader of People&#x27;s National Movement and the man known as father of the nation, increased the acceptance of steel-pan in the mainstream music scene by encouraging corporations to sponsor steel bands, giving the bands more respectability in society. Today, steel-pan is the national instrument of Trinidad and Tobago and is used worldwide. In 2013 Ancel Bhagwandeen was awarded by the Prime minister&#x27;s Awards for Scientific Ingenuity for developing and producing the World&#x27;s first tenor pan stick that is sound sensitive and displays light colours in sync with playing the steel pan. It is the first modernization of the pan stick in decades.

==Parang==

In Trinidad and Tobago the Latin American-derived seasonal Christmas music called Parang is about more than just Christmas carols. Parang is about general merrymaking and festivities around Christmas time and the food, dancing and music is all a part of the parang. The singers of parang visit the homes of family and friends and sing Christmas-themed songs in Spanish accompanied by instruments, usually the guitar, Venezuelan cuatro, maracas (known as chac-chacs on the islands), mandolin, bandolin, violin, bandola and sometimes the cello. Parang is mostly performed during the Christmas season but is also used at other festivals throughout the year, including the Santa Rosa Festival, the velorio del cruz, and the Sebucan festival. Parang includes both religious and non-religious songs and melodies set against the parang instrumentation. Parang festivities typically involve dancing and there are two primary dance styles, the slower castillian waltz and a quicker gavilan style.

==Chutney music==
Indians arrived in Trinidad and Tobago on May 30, 1845 as indentured laborers on the sugarcane, cocoa, and rice plantations, to fill the labor void left by the abolition of slavery. The island&#x27;s growing Indian population developed the musical style of chutney. This musical form based on Indian rhythms was named chutney because it is hot music, its use of double entendres and fast and repetitive rhythms make its listeners want to dance. Chutney uses a mixture of East Indian classical music, East Indian folk music, bhajans and ghazals (bhajans and ghazals are religious songs), Western and African instruments, and usually the Indian musical instruments: harmonium, dholak, tabla, dhantal, manjira, tassa, and sometimes the bulbul tarang or mandolin to accompany its fast-paced soca or calypso beats. Sundar Popo was one of the first who pioneered in this music. Chutney music is a mixture of Indian tunes influenced by calypso and soca rhythms, and it has been blended with many of the other varieties of music on the island. Artists like Apache Waria and Terry Gajraj pioneered ragga chutney. Chutney has also developed into chutney-bhangra, chutney-hip-hop, soca-bhangra and bhangra-wine.

As chutney music&#x27;s popularity grows, people are becoming more aware of the mixture of cultures present in Trinidad and Tobago. Many of the chutney artists that are known within West Indian culture are from Trinidad. Sundar Popo was a pioneer of chutney music, famous for first blending chutney with calypso and soca and increasing the popularity of the genre. The instruments used in chutney were those that were approved for women to play, making chutney becoming viewed as a woman&#x27;s music genre. Since then, chutney has grown from a woman&#x27;s genre into a leading player of the pop music scene with both men and women participating in nationwide competitions. Chutney music is a reflection on the culture of Trinidad and Tobago, its blending of Indian, Western and African elements is a representation of the backgrounds that are mixed together to form the culture of Trinidad and Tobago.

==Pop, rock and alternative music==
Trinidad and Tobago has an underground pop, rock and heavy metal scene with many small shows being held throughout the year. The largest of such shows are the annual Pop Music Awards held at the &quot;Tsunami nightclub&quot; in Chaguaramas and the Samaan Tree Rock Festival in Aranguez.

==Western classical==
There is a long tradition of western classical music, both instrumental and choral, dating back to the colonial era under the British. The Trinidad &amp; Tobago Music Festival is a primary showcase for these art forms. Choral groups, steelband and traditional western orchestras, smaller ensembles, music schools and programmes, and others stage shows at venues around the country, particularly at the Queen&#x27;s Hall in Port of Spain; the University of the West Indies (St. Augustine Campus); Central Bank Auditorium; Simon Bolivar auditorium; churches and cathedrals; and at the new National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA), which was opened in 2009 but closed down in 2014 for renovations. Popular proponents of the Western Classical form include the St Augustine Chamber Orchestra/Trinidad and Tobago Youth Philharmonic (the largest symphony orchestra and largest youth orchestra in the English-speaking Caribbean), Marionettes Chorale (the first choir to blend choral voices with the steelpan), Eastern Performing Arts Fraternity and Eastern Youth Chorale, Lydian Singers, UWI Festival Arts Chorale; the National Philharmonic and the National Steel Symphony Orchestra, and the Classical Music Development Foundation, among others.

==Hindustani classical==
Historically, the indentured laborers who came from India brought with them the form of authentic Indian Classical Music. A form of local Indo-Trinidad classical music was later created. However, organisations were able to keep the pure classical form alive. Bharatiya Vidya Sansthaan, under the guidance of Prof. Hari Shankara Adesh, was the first institution to provide courses in the authentic classical artform of India.

Prof. Rajesh Kelkar (from historic Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda), went to remote villages of Trinidad and taught classical and devotional music with missionary zeal.

== MusicTT==

The government has identified the music industry as one of three pioneering sectors that are pivotal to long-term economic sustainability because of dropping prices of oil and gas, Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s main export. For this reason, MusicTT was established in 2014 as a subsidiary of CreativeTT. MusicTT’s mandate is &quot;to stimulate and facilitate the business development and export activity of the music industry in Trinidad and Tobago to generate national wealth.&quot;

<doc id="242813" wikidata="Q1154763" url="?curid=242813" title="Strikeout">
<text>In baseball or softball, a strikeout (or strike-out) occurs when a batter accumulates three strikes during a time at bat. It means the batter is out, unless the third strike is not caught by the catcher and the batter reaches first base safely as a result. A strikeout is a statistic recorded for both pitchers and batters, and is usually denoted by the letter K, or sometimes by the initialism SO. A &quot;strikeout looking&quot;—in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire—may be denoted by an inverted K (i.e. ꓘ).

Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter, the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out. Some of the most prolific home run hitters of all time (such as Mickey Mantle, Reggie Jackson, and Jim Thome) were notorious for striking out often. Notably, Jackson and Thome respectively hold the major league records for most and second most times struck out in a career.

==Rules and jargon==
A pitched ball is ruled a &quot;ball&quot; by the umpire if the batter did not swing at it and, in that umpire&#x27;s judgement, it does not pass through the strike zone. Any pitch at which the batter swings unsuccessfully or, that in that umpire&#x27;s judgement passes through the strike zone, is ruled a &quot;strike&quot;. Each ball and strike affects the count, which is incremented for each pitched ball with the exception of a foul ball on any count with two strikes. That is, a third strike may only occur by the batter swinging and missing at a pitched ball, or the pitched ball being ruled a strike by the umpire with no swing by the batter. A pitched ball that is struck by the batter with the bat on any count, and is not a foul ball or foul tip, is &quot;in play&quot;. A batter may also strike out by bunting, even if the ball is hit into foul territory.

A pitcher receives credit for (and a batter is charged with) a strikeout on any third strike, but a batter is out only if one of the following is true:

#The third strike is pitched and caught in flight by the catcher (including foul tips);
#On any third strike, if a baserunner is on first and there are at most 1 out;
#The third strike is bunted foul and is not caught by a fielder.

Thus, it is possible for a batter to strike out, but still become a runner and reach base safely if the catcher is unable to catch the third strike cleanly, and he then does not either tag out the batter or force him out at first base. In Japan, this is called , or &quot;swing and escape&quot;. In Major League Baseball, it is known as an uncaught third strike. When this happens, a strikeout is recorded for both the pitcher and the batter, but no out is recorded. Because of this, a pitcher may occasionally be able to record more than three strikeouts in one inning.

It is also possible for a strikeout to result in a fielder&#x27;s choice. With the bases loaded and two strikes with two outs, the catcher drops the ball or catches it on the bounce. The batter-runner is obliged to run for first base and other base-runners are obliged to attempt to advance one base. Should the catcher field the ball and step on home plate before the runner from third base can score, then the runner from third base is forced out.

In baseball scorekeeping, a swinging strikeout is recorded as a K or a K-S. A strikeout looking (where the batter does not swing at a pitch that the umpire then calls strike three) is often scored with a backwards K (Ʞ), and sometimes as a K-L, CK, or Kc (the &#x27;c&#x27; for &#x27;called&#x27; strike). In terms of gameplay, swinging and looking strikeouts are exactly equivalent; the difference in notation is simply to record this aspect of the time at bat. Despite the scorekeeping custom of using &quot;K&quot; for strikeout, &quot;SO&quot; is the official abbreviation used by Major League Baseball.

&quot;K&quot; is still commonly used by fans and enthusiasts for purposes other than official record-keeping. One baseball ritual involves fans attaching a succession of small &quot;K&quot; signs to the nearest railing, one added for every strikeout notched by the home team&#x27;s pitcher, following a tradition started by New York Mets fans in honor of &quot;Dr. K&quot;, Dwight Gooden. The &quot;K&quot; may be placed upside down (Ʞ) in cases where the batter strikes out looking, just as it would appear on a scorecard. Virtually every televised display of a high-strikeout major league game will include a shot of a fan&#x27;s strikeout display, and if the pitcher continues to strike out batters, the display may be shown following every strikeout.

The use of &quot;K&quot; for a strikeout was invented by Henry Chadwick, a newspaper journalist who is widely credited as the originator of the box score and the baseball scorecard. As is true in much of baseball, both the box score and scorecard remain largely unchanged to this day. Chadwick decided to use &quot;K&quot;, the last letter in &quot;struck&quot;, since the letter &quot;S&quot; was used for &quot;sacrifice&quot;. Chadwick was responsible for several other scorekeeping conventions, including the use of numbers to designate player positions.

Those unaware of Chadwick&#x27;s contributions have speculated that &quot;K&quot; was derived from the last name of 19th-century pitcher Matt Kilroy. If not for the evidence supporting Chadwick&#x27;s earlier use of &quot;K&quot;, this explanation would be reasonable. Kilroy raised the prominence of the strikeout, setting an all-time single-season record of 513 strikeouts in 1886, only two years after overhand pitching was permitted. His record, however, is limited to its era since the pitcher&#x27;s mound was only from the batter during that season. It was moved to its current distance of 60&#x27;6&quot; in 1893. The modern record (1901–present) is 383 strikeouts, held by Nolan Ryan, one better than Sandy Koufax&#x27;s 382.

For 55 years, Walter Johnson held the career strikeout record, at 3,508. That record fell in 1982 to Nolan Ryan, who was then passed by Steve Carlton, before Ryan took the career strikeout record for good at 5,714.

==History==
Early rules stated that &quot;three balls being struck at and missed and the last one caught, is a hand-out; if not caught is considered fair, and the striker bound to run.&quot; The modern rule has changed very little. The addition of the called strike came in 1858.

In 1880, the rules were changed to specify that a third strike had to be caught on the fly. A later adjustment to the dropped third strike rule specified that a batter is automatically out when there are fewer than two out and a runner on first base. In 1887, the number of strikes for an out was changed to four, but it was promptly changed back to three the next season.

The rule that a third strike (only) must be caught originates in the concept that a third strike is not an automatic out, but rather puts the ball in play. The rule was described at least as early as Johann Christoph Friedrich GutsMuths&#x27; 1793 book (Gymnastics for Youth) and has remained in effect since. After the third strike, the ball being in play, the batter (now a runner) must be put out. This is almost always done immediately after the strike is made, by the catcher (putouts on strikeouts are still credited to the catcher), but if the ball is not caught on the fly by the catcher, the batter/runner must be put out by the same means as any other runner who puts a ball in play which is not caught on the fly—by soaking (hitting the runner with a ball thrown by a fielder, now long obsolete), or by being tagged out, or by leaving the baseline, or by force out at first base.

==Slang==
A swinging strikeout is often called a &quot;whiff&quot;, while a batter who is struck out by a fastball is often said to have been &quot;blown away&quot;. A batter who strikes out on a swung third strike is said to have &quot;fanned&quot; (as in a fanning motion), whereas if he takes a called third strike it is called a &quot;punch out&quot; (describing the plate umpire&#x27;s dramatic punching motion on a called third strike). However, sometimes these words are used as general synonyms for a strikeout, irrespective of whether it was swinging or looking. The announcer Ernie Harwell called a batter who took a called third strike, usually on the other team, &quot;out for excessive window-shopping&quot; or having &quot;stood like the house by the side of the road&quot;.

On a called third strike, it is said that the batter was &quot;caught looking&quot;, or that he looked at a strike. Typically, a called third strike can be somewhat more embarrassing for a batter, as it shows that he was either fooled by the pitcher or, even worse, had a moment of hesitation.

For example, Carlos Beltrán was caught looking at strike 3 to end the 2006 NLCS, and the season, for the New York Mets. Sports commentators have also been known to refer to it as &quot;browsing&quot; if the batter did not move his bat at all.

A pitcher is said to &quot;striking out the side&quot; when he retires all three batters in a half-inning by striking them out. This term is also used when all three outs were caused by strikeouts, regardless of how other batters in the inning fared. If a pitcher strikes out three batters on nine pitches, he is said to have pitched an &quot;immaculate inning&quot;. A batter that takes the third strike looking, especially on a breaking pitch like a slider or a curveball that appears to be out of the strike zone but drops in before he can get the bat off his shoulders, can be said to have been &quot;frozen&quot;.

In slang, when a batter strikes out three times in a game, he is said to have completed a &quot;hat trick&quot;. If he strikes out four times, it is called a &quot;golden sombrero&quot;. He receives a &quot;platinum sombrero&quot; if he strikes out five times, and this dishonor is also known as the &quot;Olympic rings&quot;.

Striking out six times is a rare occurrence, which in the history of major league play has only occurred in games that went to extra innings, with Sam Horn of the Baltimore Orioles being one of the few to do this. The slugger&#x27;s then-teammate, pitcher Mike Flanagan, told reporters after that 1991 event that six strikeouts would thereafter be known as a &quot;Horn&quot;. He added that if anyone ever strikes out seven times in one game, it will be a &quot;Horn of Plenty&quot;.
Some pitchers who specialize in strikeouts have acquired nicknames including the letter &quot;K&quot;. Dwight Gooden was known as &quot;Doctor K&quot; (alluding to basketball star Julius Erving a.k.a. &quot;Dr. J&quot;). Francisco Rodríguez is known as &quot;K-Rod&quot;. Roger Clemens has taken the &quot;K&quot; name to an extreme by naming his four sons Koby, Kory, Kacy, and Kody. Tim Lincecum is nicknamed &quot;The Say &#x27;K&#x27; Kid&quot;, alluding to former Giants player Willie Mays who was called &quot;The Say Hey Kid&quot;. Daisuke Matsuzaka is known as &quot;Dice-K&quot;, a term that was used as a pronunciation guide for his name when he first arrived in MLB.

Hall of Fame strikeout artist Sandy Koufax of the Los Angeles Dodgers coincidentally has a last name starting with &quot;K&quot;, and in his call of the pitcher&#x27;s perfect game in 1965, Dodgers announcer Vin Scully commented that Koufax&#x27;s name &quot;will always remind you of strikeouts&quot;.

== More than three strikeouts in an inning ==
If a third strike is not caught cleanly by the catcher, it is still recorded as a strikeout for both the pitcher and the batter, but the batter becomes a runner and the play is still alive. (This is not true when first base is occupied and there are fewer than two outs; see Uncaught third strike.) The runner may take first base unless the defense tags or throws him out. Therefore, a pitcher can achieve more than three strikeouts in one standard half-inning.

Prior to 1960, the event occurred only seven times. The first Major League player to be credited with the feat was Ed &quot;Cannonball&quot; Crane of the New York Giants on October 4, 1888. It has occurred in Major League Baseball 76 times. Chuck Finley accomplished the feat on May 12 and August 15, 1999, with the Anaheim Angels and again on April 16, 2000, with the Cleveland Indians. Pete Richert of the Los Angeles Dodgers is the only pitcher to do it in his MLB debut (April 12, 1962, against the Cincinnati Reds). Steve Delabar struck out four men in the 10th inning, and recorded the win in a 3–2 victory over the Chicago White Sox on August 13, 2012, making him the first pitcher in major league history to record four strikeouts in an extra inning.

For a list of pitchers who have achieved more than three strikeouts in an inning, including the most recent pitcher to do so, see List of Major League Baseball single-inning strikeout leaders.

Five strikeouts in one inning have never occurred in a regulation Major League Baseball game. They have occurred at least six times at the minor league level. John Perkovitsh of Wisconsin Rapids did so against Oshkosh in a Wisconsin State League game on May 17, 1946, while Ron Necciai of Bristol in the Appalachian League accomplished the feat against Johnson City on May 17, 1952. Kelly Wunsch of the Beloit Brewers fanned five in the third inning on April 15, 1994. Mike Schultz of the Lancaster JetHawks struck out five batters in one inning on July 16, 2004, and Garrett Bauer of the Rockford RiverHawks struck out five batters in one inning on July 1, 2008. Most recently, Malcolm Van Buren of the Burlington Royals struck out five in the seventh inning of a game on July 31, 2019. That this has never happened in Major League play reflects the rarity of a pitcher getting a strikeout with an uncaught third strike, but also that,

# A second uncaught third strike happens with two outs, whether or not a runner is on first base and that the batter safely reaches first base, or
# that with fewer than two outs, the first baserunner, who reached base on an uncaught third strike, must have scored or be on a base other than first before another strikeout with a dropped 3rd strike can occur. Alternately, one or two normal strikeouts must be recorded before the second runner can possibly reach first base on a dropped 3rd strike; only when the second batter-runner reaches base can the 5th strikeout be completed.

Houston Astros pitcher Joe Niekro struck out five Minnesota Twins batters in the first inning of an exhibition spring training game on April 7, 1976, in New Orleans. Niekro&#x27;s catcher, Cliff Johnson, was charged with five passed balls in the inning. Exhibition games are not recorded in official statistics.

<text>Alma mater (; : almae matres) is an allegorical Latin phrase meaning &#x27;nourishing mother&#x27;. It personifies a school that a person has attended or graduated from. The term is related to &quot;alumnus&quot;, literally meaning &#x27;nursling&#x27;, which describes a school graduate. 

In its earliest usage, &quot;alma mater&quot; was an honorific title for various mother goddesses, especially Ceres or Cybele. Later, in Catholicism, it became a title for Mary, mother of Jesus. By the early 17th century, the nursing mother became an allegory for universities. Used by many schools in Europe and North America, it has special association with the University of Bologna, whose motto &quot;Alma Mater Studiorum&quot; (&quot;nurturing mother of studies&quot;) emphasizes its role in originating the modern university.

Several university campuses in North America have artistic representations of &quot;alma mater&quot;, depicted as a robed woman wearing a laurel wreath crown. 

==Etymology==

Although &quot;alma&quot; (nourishing) was a common epithet for Ceres, Cybele, Venus, and other mother goddesses, it was not frequently used in conjunction with &quot;mater&quot; in classical Latin. In the &quot;Oxford Latin Dictionary&quot;, the full phrase&#x27;s origin is attributed to &quot;De rerum natura&quot;, in which Lucretius uses the term as an epithet for an unnamed earth goddess:
&lt;poem lang=&quot;la&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Denique caelesti sumus omnes semine oriundi
omnibus ille idem pater est, unde alma liquentis
umoris guttas mater cum terra recepit (2.991–993)&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;We are all sprung from that celestial seed,
all of us have same father, from whom earth,
the nourishing mother, receives drops of liquid moisture&lt;/poem&gt;

After the fall of Rome, the term was used in Christian liturgy to describe Jesus&#x27; mother, Mary. &quot;Alma Redemptoris Mater&quot; is a well-known eleventh century antiphon devoted to Mary.

The earliest documented use of the term to refer to a university is in 1600, when the University of Cambridge printer, John Legate, began using an emblem for the university press. The first-known appearance of the device is on the title-page of a book by William Perkins, &quot;A Golden Chain&quot;, where the Latin phrase &quot;Alma Mater Cantabrigia&quot; (&quot;nourishing mother Cambridge&quot;) is inscribed on a pedestal bearing a lactating woman wearing a mural crown.

In reference works of English etymology, often the first university-related usage is cited as 1710, when an academic mother figure is mentioned in a remembrance of Henry More by Richard Ward.

==Special use==
Many historic European universities have adopted &quot;Alma Mater&quot; as part of the Latin translation of their official name. The Latin name of the University of Bologna, (nourishing mother of studies), refers to its status as the oldest continuously operating university in the world. At other European universities, such as the Alma Mater Lipsiensis in Leipzig, Germany, or Alma Mater Jagiellonica, Poland, the title emphasizes historic ties to a founding city or dynasty. 

The Alma Mater Europaea in Salzburg, Austria, an international university founded by the European Academy of Sciences and Arts in 2010, uses the term as its official name.

In the United States, the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, has been called the &quot;Alma Mater of the Nation&quot; because of its ties to the founding of the country.

At Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario, and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, the main student government is known as the Alma Mater Society.

==Monuments==
Modern sculptures of &quot;Alma Mater&quot; are found on several North American university campuses. In 1901, a bronze statue of &quot;Alma Mater&quot; by Daniel Chester French was installed of steps of Columbia University&#x27;s Low Library. A similar sculpture, cast in 1919 by Mario Korbel, sits on the main entrance steps at the University of Havana. Later American tributes to &quot;alma mater&quot; include Lorado Taft&#x27;s &quot;1929 sculpture&quot; at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Cyrus Dallin&#x27;s 1925 sculpture at the Mary Institute in 1925, commissioned by Washington University supporters. 

An altarpiece mural in Yale University&#x27;s Sterling Memorial Library, painted in 1932 by Eugene Savage, depicts the &quot;Alma Mater&quot; as a bearer of light and truth, standing in the midst of figures representing the arts and sciences.

<doc id="242821" wikidata="Q707986" url="?curid=242821" title="The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)">
<text>The Diary of Anne Frank is a 1959 American biographical drama film based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1955 play of the same name, which was in turn based on the posthumously published diary of Anne Frank, a German-born Jewish girl who lived in hiding in Amsterdam with her family during World War II. It was directed by George Stevens, a Hollywood filmmaker previously involved with capturing evidence of concentration camps during the war, with a screenplay by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett. It is the first film version of both the play and the original story, and features three members of the original Broadway cast.

Many of Frank&#x27;s writings to her diary were addressed as &quot;Dear Kitty&quot;. It was published after the end of the war by her father, Otto Frank (played in the film by Joseph Schildkraut, who was also Jewish). His entire family had been murdered in the Holocaust. The interiors were shot in Los Angeles on a sound stage duplicate of the Amsterdam factory, with exteriors filmed at the actual building.

The film was positively received by critics, currently holding a 81% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It won three Academy Awards in 1960, including Best Supporting Actress for Shelley Winters. Shelley Winters later donated her Oscar to the Anne Frank Museum. In 2006, it was honored as the eighteenth most inspiring American film on the list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers.

==Plot==

In 1945, Otto Frank returns to Amsterdam after World War II ended. After climbing the stairs to a deserted garret, he is joined and comforted by Miep Gies and Mr. Kraler, office workers who shielded him and his family from the Nazis. Otto begins to search for the diary written by his youngest daughter, Anne. Miep promptly retrieves it for him and he receives solace reading the words written by Anne three years earlier.

The action moves back to July 1942, and Anne begins by writing of the restrictions placed upon Jews that drove the Franks into hiding over the spice factory. Sharing the Franks&#x27; hiding place are the Van Daans and their teenage son, Peter. Kraler, who works in the office below, and Miep, his assistant, have arranged the hideaway and warn the families that they must maintain strict silence during daylight hours while the workers are there. Kraler delivers food and a box for Anne compiled by Otto, which contains her beloved photos of movie stars and a blank diary.

As the months pass, Anne Frank’s irrepressible energy reasserts itself and she constantly teases Peter, whose only attachment is to his cat, Mouschi. Otto teaches Anne and her sister, Margot, while Mrs. Van Daan passes the time by recounting fond memories of her youth and possesses the fur coat given by her father. The strain of confinement causes the Van Daans to argue and pits Anne against her mother, Edith. One day, Kraler brings a radio to the attic, providing the families with ears to the world. Soon after, he asks them to take in another person, a Jewish dentist named Albert Dussel, who recounts the dire conditions outside, in which Jews suddenly disappear and are shipped to the concentration camps, and confirms the disappearance of many of their friends.

One night, Anne dreams of seeing one of her friends in a concentration camp and wakes up screaming. In October 1942, news came of the Allied landing in Africa, but the bombing of Amsterdam intensified. During Hanukkah, Van Daan abruptly announces that Peter must get rid of Mouschi because he consumes too much food. Their argument is cut short when they hear a prowler break in the front door and the room falls silent, only when Peter crashes into an object on the floor while trying to catch Mouschi. The startled thief grabs a typewriter and flees. A watchman notices the break-in and summons two police officers, who search the premises, until Mouschi knocks a plate from the sink, reassuring them that the noise was caused by a common cat and they leave. Otto, hoping to foster faith and courage, leads everyone in a Hanukkah song.

In January 1944, Anne begins to attract Peter&#x27;s attention while Miep brings the group a cake. Then Van Daan asks Miep to sell his wife Petronella&#x27;s fur coat so that he can buy cigarettes. Kraler warns that one of his employees asked for a raise and implies that something strange is going on in the attic, which Dussel dourly comments that it is just a matter of time before they are discovered. Anne blames the adults for the war that has destroyed all sense of hope and ideals, and storms out of the room, where Peter follows and comforts her. Later, Anne confides her dreams of becoming a writer, and Peter voices frustration about his inability to join the war effort.

One morning, Van Daan tries to steal some bread from the others but Edith catches him and denounces him, ordering him and his family to leave. As Dussel and Mrs. Van Daan quarrel over food, word comes over the radio of the Allied invasion of France and Mr. Van Daan breaks into tears of shame. Heartened by the news, everyone apologizes for their harsh words, and Anne dreams of being back in school by the fall.

By July 1944 the invasion has bogged down and Kraler was hospitalized with ulcers. Upon hearing that the police have found the stolen typewriter, Anne writes that her diary provides her with a way to go on living after her death. The Van Daans begin to quarrel once more, and Peter declares that he cannot tolerate the situation and Anne soothes him by reminding him of the goodness of those who have come to their aid. Their conversation is interrupted by the sirens of an approaching police truck. Certain of their impending arrest, they passionately kiss. As the German uniformed police break down the premises and the bookcase entrance, Otto declares they no longer have to live in fear but can go forward in hope.

Back in 1945, Otto tells Miep and Kraler about his long journey home after his release from Auschwitz. He learned about the deaths of Edith, Margot, the Van Daans, and Dussel, and he hopes that Anne had somehow survived until he sadly reveals that he met a woman who had been in Bergen-Belsen with Anne and confirmed her death. He then glances at Anne&#x27;s diary and reads, &quot;In spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart,&quot; and reflects upon her unshakeable optimism.

Otto Frank wrote to Audrey Hepburn, asking her if she would play the part of his daughter Anne. He told Hepburn that his daughter would have been honoured to have such a famous Hollywood actress play her on film, and he also noted the striking resemblance that existed between Anne and Hepburn when she was an adolescent. She was initially interested in the role, and her name appears on the back cover of copies of the diary printed and sold to promote the &quot;upcoming film&quot;.

During the casting period, Hepburn ultimately wrote back declining the offer, saying she felt she was too old, and lacked the skills to portray Anne. She said she was greatly honoured to have been given the choice, and noted the similarity between her own war experience and that of the Franks and the others in the annex. Hepburn and Anne were born within a month of each other in May and June 1929, and both spent their adolescences in Nazi-occupied Holland. The role went to American newcomer Millie Perkins.

==Production==

The film is an adaptation of the successful Broadway play based on Anne Frank&#x27;s diary, which was first published in English in 1952. At the time of the film&#x27;s production, the book had already sold millions of copies around the world.

According to a 1955 article published on the &quot;Daily Variety&quot;, Garson Kanin, who had staged the Broadway play, and Milton Sperling from Warner Bros. had intended to acquire the film rights, but ultimately they were sold to Buddy Adler of 20th Century-Fox. Originally, William Wyler was in talks to direct before George Stevens signed on as producer and director.

Principal photography took place from 5 March to 11 August 1958, with additional scenes shot in November. Location work was done in Amsterdam, while the set of the annex was constructed at the 20th Century-Fox Studios in Los Angeles. George Stevens initially resisted the idea of shooting the film in CinemaScope because he thought that this format would not convey the claustrophobic effect he wanted to reproduce. When Spyros Skouras, president of 20th Century-Fox, insisted on CinemaScope, Stevens and cinematographer William C. Mellor decided to reduce the space by limiting the action to the center of the screen. Mellor further developed the look of the film by using fluorescent tubes, filters and gas rather than traditional studio lighting.

==Premiere==
The film premiered March 18, 1959, at the Palace Theatre in New York City.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
The film was mostly positively received by critics. 

IMDb listed the film&#x27;s 9 Wins and 14 nominations from the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes, the Directors Guild of America, the Laurel Awards, the Moscow International Film Festival, the National Board of Review (USA), the Writers Guild of America, and the International Film Music Critics Association.

&quot;Variety&quot;, in its review on December 31, 1958, stated: &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank...is a film of often extraordinary quality. It manages, within the framework of a tense and tragic situation, to convey the beauty of a young and inquiring spirit that soars beyond the cramped confinement of the Frank family&#x27;s hideout in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam.

&quot;And yet, with all its technical perfection, the inspired direction and the sensitivity with which many of the scenes are handled, Diary is simply too long. Everything possible is done to keep the action moving within its narrow, cluttered space, and a remarkable balance is achieved between stark terror and comedy relief, yet there are moments when the film lags and the dialog becomes forced. Unlike the play, the picture leaves too little to the imagination.&quot;

Of Shelley Winters, the Academy Award winner for Best Supporting Actress, Variety stated: &quot;As the Van Daan couple, Shelley Winters and Lou Jacobi come up with vivid characterizations that score on all levels.&quot; 

In his New York Times review on March 19, 1959, Bosley Crowther stated: &quot;GEORGE STEVENS&#x27; motion picture rendering of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; is so good, so substantially sound and eloquent of so many ideas and moods that it genuinely grieves this observer to have to come out and say that it lacks the capstone strength of spiritual splendor in the projection of the Anne Frank role. Mr. Stevens has done a superb job of putting upon the screen the basic drama and shivering authenticity of the Frances Goodrich-Albert Hackett play, which in turn caught the magnitude of drama in the real-life diary of a Jewish girl. He has brilliantly flowed a three-hour picture through an attic in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam and etched a harrowing ordeal for survival in the brave behavior of eight Jews hiding there.

&quot;...Mr. Stevens was able to get on the CinemaScope screen a sense of the closeness of the drama and hold it for as long as he does. The doings of eight bourgeois people in such cramped quarters for more than two years would seem to defy intense inspection and rapt anxiety for nigh three hours (two hours and fifty minutes precisely) via the techniques of this fluid medium. Yet Mr. Stevens has done it. With successive superbly detailed scenes that convey the cluttered, claustrophobic nature of that hideout in Amsterdam, he has developed a slow heat of friction among the people secluded there and frequent hot fusions of mental torment when discovery threatens from downstairs.&quot;

===Accolades===
* The American Film Institute included the film as No. 18 in its list of the most inspiring movies, AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Cheers.
* In 1975, Shelley Winters donated her Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress statuette to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam where it is on display.

The special features included some of the following; &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank: Echoes From the Past&quot; featurette, a press conference with director George Stevens, MovieTone news announcing public appearances by Millie Perkins, a screen test, and an audio commentary by Millie Perkins and George Stevens Jr, the director&#x27;s son.

A fiftieth-anniversary edition of the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on June 16, 2009, three months after its actual release anniversary, in commemoration of what would have been Anne Frank&#x27;s 80th birthday. It included seven major new featurettes: three cast interviews, a behind-the scenes look at the score, two short documentaries about George Stevens&#x27; memories from the war and the history of the diary, and a perspective piece on the film&#x27;s legacy by Thomas Rothman.

The Blu-ray was released only a month before Tony van Renterghem died on July 19, 2009. Renterghem, a Dutch cinematographer and technical, historical and script adviser who worked with Stevens for many years, consulted on both the play and the film. While his work was almost entirely behind the scenes, his knowledge helped in putting together the historical featurettes.

<text>Haileybury is a co-educational public school (fee-charging boarding and day school for 11- to 18-year-olds) located in Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire. It is a member of the Rugby Group and enrols pupils at the 11+, 13+ and 16+ stages of education. Over 890 pupils attend Haileybury, of whom more than 550 board. The campus occupies over 500 acres of Hertfordshire countryside, approximately 20 miles from London.

== Academic ==
Haileybury was judged &#x27;Excellent in all areas&#x27; in its 2022 Inspection Report by the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI).

In 2022, 90% of A Level/IB grades were awarded at A*-B, or the equivalent.

In 2023, the school saw 43.9% of its candidates score A*/A 

== Model United Nations ==
Haileybury hosts its own Model United Nations Conference every year, for over a thousand pupils, making it largest MUN conference in the UK. The conference is typically held the weekend before the Easter holiday.

== History ==
The Haileybury campus originally belonged to, and was occupied by, the East India College, the training establishment founded in 1806 for administrators of the East India Company. The East India College was initially based at Hertford Castle, but substantial grounds in Hertford Heath were acquired for future development. William Wilkins, the architect of Downing College, Cambridge, and the National Gallery in London, was appointed principal architect. The buildings compose four ranges which enclose an area known as Quad, the second-largest academic quadrangle in Britain after Christ Church, Oxford. 

The East India College closed in 1858 and, four years later, Haileybury College was set up as a boarding school for boys on the site. The first headmaster was Arthur Gray Butler. In 1942, Haileybury and the Imperial Service College (which had itself subsumed the United Services College) merged to become Haileybury and Imperial Service College, now referred to simply as Haileybury.

In the late 20th century, reforming headmaster David Jewell took charge of Haileybury, bringing it out of its post-Cold War austerity. Stuart Westley, Master of Haileybury until July 2009, was responsible for making the school fully co-educational.

=== Haileybury Almaty ===

In 2006/2007, Haileybury advised on the building of a Haileybury in Almaty, Kazakhstan where all English GCSEs are taught and the curriculum is taught similarly under the guidance of Haileybury. The school, opened in September 2008, is known as Haileybury Almaty.

The pupils are made up mostly of Kazakh citizens. They are all required to speak English. The academic year 2010–11 saw the first batch of pupils pass their IGCSE exams. Since August 2011, Haileybury Almaty has opened a sixth form. In 2016, 11 pupils graduated from the sixth form, with one getting admission to Trinity College, Cambridge University, and 6 securing places at University College, London (UCL). A second school, in the Kazakhstan capital, Astana, was opened in September 2011.

<doc id="242827" wikidata="Q846784" url="?curid=242827" title="Music of Sweden">
<text>The music of Sweden shares roots with its neighbouring countries in Scandinavia, as well as Eastern Europe, including polka, schottische, waltz, polska and mazurka. The Swedish fiddle and nyckelharpa are among the most common Swedish folk instruments. The instrumental genre is the biggest one in Sweden. In the 1960s, Swedish youth sparked a roots revival in Swedish folk culture. Many joined &quot;Spelmanslag&quot; (folk musicians&#x27; clubs) and performed on mainstream radio and TV. They focused on instrumental polska music, with vocals and influences from other traditional genres becoming more prominent since the 1990s. By 1970, the &quot;dansband&quot; culture also began. Music in Sweden is a vital part of Swedish culture, as evidenced by the national success of musical shows like Allsång på Skansen and Melodifestivalen.

Swedish music has also included more modern and influences. On a per capita basis, Sweden is the world&#x27;s most successful exporter of music. Its most famous export is ABBA, one of the best-selling popular music groups of all time. Sweden has also historically dominated the Scandinavian music scene, with Danes and Norwegians listening to music in Swedish rather than the other way around. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Scandinavian death metal bands became very popular with the international heavy metal community.

Music in Sweden has a long history, with musical evidence dating back to prehistory. Throughout the history of Sweden, the Swedish monarchy have been extensive patrons; notably, Gustav Vasa and Gustav III were both considered very fond of music. Gustav Vasa encouraged musicians to attend his court, and Gustav III would found the Royal Swedish Opera and Royal Swedish Academy of Music; the latter institutions are still major promoters of Swedish music today. Sweden&#x27;s most famous classic troubadour was Carl Michael Bellman, who lived from 1740 to 1795; he is famous for his extensive use of the lower class in his works. Later examples of troubadours include Evert Taube, Cornelis Vreeswijk, Fred Åkerström, and Povel Ramel. Amongst other well-known classical Swedish composers are Joseph Martin Kraus, Franz Berwald and Johan Helmich Roman.

==Traditional==

Swedish folk songs are dominated by ballads and kulning; the latter was originally used as a cow-herding call and is traditionally sung by women. Ballad stories descend from skillingtryck printed songs from the 19th century. Modern bands like Folk och Rackare, Hedningarna and Garmarna incorporated folk songs into their repertoire.

===Swedish folk instruments===

The fiddle is perhaps the most characteristic and original instrument of the Swedish folk tradition. It had arrived by the 17th century, and became widespread until 19th-century religious fundamentalism preached that most forms of music were sinful and ungodly. Despite the oppression, several fiddlers achieved a reputation for their virtuosity, including Jämtland&#x27;s Lapp-Nils, Bingsjö&#x27;s Pekkos Per and Malung&#x27;s Lejsme-Per Larsson. None of these musicians were ever recorded; the first major fiddler to be recorded was Hjort Anders Olsson. Other early fiddlers of the 20th century included Nils Agenmark and Päkkos Gustaf. There is an extensive traditional repertoire of fiddle tunes, in forms such as the 3/4 polska and the 4/4 gånglåt. One type fiddle peculiar to Sweden is the låtfiol, a fiddle with two sympathetic strings, similar to the Norwegian Hardanger fiddle

The nyckelharpa (keyed fiddle) is similar to both a fiddle and a hurdy-gurdy, and is known from Sweden since at least 1350, when it was carved on a gate in a church in Gotland. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the nyckelharpa was known throughout Sweden, Denmark and particularly in the province of Uppland. The latter has long been a stronghold for nyckelharpa music, including through the 60s revival, which drew on musicians like Byss-Calle from Älvkarleby. The instrument played at this time was not the same as that used today; August Bohlin and Eric Sahlström made changes to the instrument that made it a chromatic and straight, more violin-like instrument. In spite of these innovations, the nyckelharpa&#x27;s popularity declined until the 1960s roots revival. The nyckelharpa was a prominent part of several revival groups later in the century, especially Väsen and Hedningarna.

The Swedish bagpipes &quot;(säckpipa)&quot; has been part of a long-running folk tradition, passed down orally until the death of Gudmunds Nils Larsson in 1949. Later revivalists such as Per Gudmundson added a tuning slide and revitalized the instrument.

Accordions and harmonicas were an integral part of Swedish folk music from the beginning of the 20th century, when they contributed to the gammeldans genre. The most famous Swedish accordionist is undoubtedly Kalle Jularbo, who was famous throughout the early 20th century. Later, the accordion fell out of favour within the roots revival, and did not return until the very end of the 1970s.

===Roots revival===

In the 1960s, Swedish jazz musicians like Jan Johansson used folk influences in their work, resulting in an early 1970s series of music festivals in Stockholm. The Swedish Music Movement reflected a popular trend towards jazz- and rock-oriented folk music, featuring many performers who brought a new vitality to Swedish folk.

==Classical==

The father of Swedish classical music is often claimed to be Johan Helmich Roman (1694–1758); his most famous work is the Drottningholm Music, written for the wedding of Crown Prince Adolf Frederick. Another influential composer is Carl Michael Bellman, whose patron was the king Gustav III of Sweden. Bellmans&#x27; songs are often about drinking, prostitution and everyday love troubles. He was a virtuoso improviser, and his songs, in the collections &quot;Fredmans epistlar&quot; and &quot;Fredmans sånger&quot;, are widely performed in Europe in different translations. Bellman is most notable for his extensive influence on later Swedish musical traditions. Joseph Martin Kraus (1756–1792) had a life span very similar to that of Mozart, who lived between 1756 and 1792. Kraus was an innovative composer, with a music filled with finesse and bold contrasts. His harmonic language was very personal, although his ability to develop motives never reached the level of the Viennese composers such as Mozart or Haydn. In the early romantic era, Franz Berwald (1796–1868) was the most prominent of the Swedish composers. His music was almost ignored during his lifetime, and he made his living as an orthopedic surgeon. He gained most of his recognition after his death, and composers such as Atterberg and Wilhelm Stenhammar worked hard to raise interest in Berwalds&#x27; music.

Wilhelm Stenhammar (1871–1927) was one of the later national romantic composers. He owned a reputation as one of the finest pianists of his time. He studied for some years in Berlin, where he came in contact with German high romanticism, such as Bruckner and Wagner, which influenced him a lot when he wrote his two symphonies. He also wrote six string quartets, a respectable amount of piano music and one opera, Tyrfing, treating a Norse mythological subject. Another national romantic composer who was also a conductor and violinist, was Hugo Alfvén (1872–1960). His orchestration is bright and colorful, reminiscent of that of Richard Strauss, although the harmonic language differs a lot. Some of his works, such as the Swedish rhapsodies, are program music, which means music with an underlying program that is meant to be evoked in the listener&#x27;s mind. Alfvén appears as a character in the film &quot;The Passion of Marie&quot;.

Important composers in the early 1900s are Hilding Rosenberg, Kurt Atterberg, Ture Rangström. The best-known opera singers were the 19th century soprano Jenny Lind and the 20th century tenor Jussi Björling, who had great success abroad as a tenor. Also sopranos Christina Nilsson, Birgit Nilsson, and tenor Nicolai Gedda, baritone Håkan Hagegård and the contemporary soprano Miah Persson and mezzo-sopranos Anne Sofie von Otter and Katarina Karnéus have become known in the world of opera. Evert Taube, Povel Ramel, Cornelis Vreeswijk, Fred Akerstrom are all popular modern troubadours, considered to be classics in Swedish music. Sweden also has a very prominent choral music tradition, deriving in part from the cultural importance of Swedish folk songs and the popularity of choir schools.

===Choral===
Sweden has a long tradition of professional and amateur choir singing. A large percentage of the Swedes sing in amateur choirs in various styles. The choirs of Sweden are among the best in the world, with the Radio Choir, owned by Sveriges Radio (Swedish public radio) being one of the world&#x27;s top professional classical choirs. Lunds Studentsångförening (LSS) and Orphei Drängar (OD) are two world-class male choirs singing both in Swedish and other languages. The choir leader Eric Ericson started his career as chief conductor of OD in the 1950s. The Adolf Fredrik&#x27;s Music School, in Stockholm, is commonly considered Sweden&#x27;s most prestigious music school.

===Jazz===
Well-known jazz names include: Alice Babs, who worked with Duke Ellington for many years starting in 1963, Arne Domnerus, who has recorded albums with James Moody, Art Farmer and Clifford Brown, Bengt Hallberg, Bobo Stenson, Esbjörn Svensson Trio, composer and jazz musician Georg Riedel, Georg Wadenius, best-selling jazz musician Jan Johansson, the jazz duo Koop, Lars Gullin, the multi-instrumentalist and composer Magnus Lindgren, singer and actress Monica Zetterlund, Nils Landgren, Putte Wickman, Rolf Ericson, guitar virtuoso Ulf Wakenius, and Åke Hasselgård. In addition, American jazz trumpeter Don Cherry was based in Sweden for much of his later life.

===Popular music===

Sweden is one of the world&#x27;s biggest exporters of music relative to the size of its economy and population. The most famous Swedish popular music act of all time is ABBA, composed of members Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. After winning the Eurovision Song Contest 1974, ABBA grew to become the dominant pop band of the 70s and early 80s. Their sales figures are disputed but claims have been made of 380 million records around the world, making them the second-most successful group in history after The Beatles. ABBA continues to sell around one million records a year worldwide. ABBA members Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus have been very successful in musical theatre, with their international hit &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, as well as &quot;Chess&quot;, and &quot;Kristina från Duvemåla&quot;, which was a huge success in Sweden. The female members also pursued solo careers after the breakup. Agnetha Fältskog has scored various hits as a solo artist, with her 2013 album &quot;A&quot; selling up to 1.5 million copies worldwide.

ABBA marked the beginning of an era in which Swedish pop music gained international prominence, a position it still maintains today. Excluding the UK, Sweden is the European nation with the most number-one hits on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: as of 2019, seven songs have reached the #1 position. The first one was a 1974 cover version of &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot;, performed by Blue Swede, followed by ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; in 1977. Roxette had no less than four number-one hits between 1989 and 1991: &quot;The Look&quot;, &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot;, &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; and &quot;Joyride&quot;, and in 1994 Ace of Base reached the top with their hit &quot;The Sign&quot;.

Since the 1990s, Sweden&#x27;s influence on the international pop music scene has been most evident via a number of its heavyweight songwriters and producers. Cheiron Studios, spearheaded by Denniz Pop and his protégé Max Martin, helped Ace of Base become an international success, and then went on to create some of the biggest hits of Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, Westlife, and later Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift and The Weeknd, to name just a few. Denniz Pop died from cancer in 1998 and Cheiron Studios was closed two years later, but Martin remains a superstar in the industry - only Paul McCartney has written more #1 &quot;Billboard&quot; hits than Max Martin. Other prominent producers who were part of Cheiron include Carl Falk, Rami Yacoub, Kristian Lundin, Per Magnusson and Andreas Carlsson. In Cheiron&#x27;s and Max Martin&#x27;s wake a number of successful producers have also emerged in later years, including Shellback, Bloodshy &amp; Avant, and RedOne.

The success of Swedish popular music is also evident in the Eurovision Song Contest. The contest attracts great interest and the Swedish contestant is selected through Melodifestivalen, a series of qualifiers which is Sweden&#x27;s most popular TV show. Since ABBA&#x27;s win in 1974, Sweden has won the Eurovision Song Contest six more times: in 1984 with Herreys, in 1991 with Carola Häggkvist, in 1999 with Charlotte Nilsson, in 2012 with Loreen, in 2015 with Måns Zelmerlöw, and most recently in 2023 again with Loreen. With these seven wins, Sweden is the country with the most number of Eurovision victories, tied with Ireland.

Some of the most successful post-ABBA popular music artists from Sweden are Europe, Roxette, Madleen Kane, Agnes, Ace of Base, Kent, Carola Häggkvist, Army of Lovers, Neneh and Eagle-Eye Cherry, Leila K, Robyn, A*Teens, Nanne Grönvall, The Cardigans, BWO, Andreas Johnson, Alcazar, and September. A number of renowned rock and pop-oriented artists have come out of the country in recent years, including Eskobar, Bob Hund, Clawfinger, The Sounds, The Hives, Hardcore Superstar, Millencolin, Sahara Hotnights, The Hellacopters, The Ark, Infinite Mass, Mando Diao, Looptroop Rockers and José González. The Knife and Jens Lekman have both received significant underground acclaim in recent years. Such has been the success of music abroad that clubs specializing in Swedish music have sprung up in major cities like Berlin, Barcelona and London. Rock band Kent are also often regarded as a pop band based on the variety of sounds found on their various albums.

Some Swedish easy listening/contemporary groups and artists who are not as well known internationally, but are recognized in Sweden, include Gyllene Tider, Peter Jöback, Lill-Babs Svensson, Marie Fredriksson, Laleh, Per Gessle, Ted Gärdestad, Helen Sjöholm, Charlotte Perrelli, Loreen, Sanna Nielsen, Lena Philipsson and Patrik Isaksson. Many bubblegum dance artists emerged from Sweden, including Smile.dk, made famous by the videogame &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;.

===Hip hop music===

While jazz, blues and soul have been around for a long time in Sweden, hip hop is a more recent addition. Swedish hip hop emerged in the first half of the 1980s and crossed into the mainstream a decade later. Artists that achieved mainstream popularity in the early 1990s include Just D, Infinite Mass and The Latin Kings. In the late 1990s there was a second breakthrough and artists like Petter, Ken Ring, Thomas Rusiak, Timbuktu and Looptroop Rockers became well-known. More recent acts worth mentioning are Promoe (of Looptroop Rockers), Roffe Ruff, Snook, Ison &amp; Fille, Maskinen, Million Stylez, Rebstar, Adam Tensta, and Drain Gang. Swing hip hop jazz also has made a mark with the band Movits! as a frontrunner.

===Rock===

While rock is not as widespread in Sweden as pop or metal are, there are some very interesting acts. The 1990s saw the rise of Kent, who became the most popular Swedish rock band in Scandinavia until they disbanded in 2016; Kent is still one of the most popular acts in Sweden and Scandinavia.

Some of Sweden&#x27;s rock bands include:

===Punk rock===

The most prominent and important Swedish punk rock band is Ebba Grön (1977–1982) headed by Joakim Thåström. Thåström also had two other bands called Imperiet and Peace, Love &amp; Pitbulls but they were very pop influenced and never became anywhere near as popular as Ebba Grön. However, Thåström is still big in Sweden, now as a solo artist.

Sweden is also home to several influential emo and hardcore punk bands, such as Fireside, Last Days Of April, Satanic Surfers, Kelly 8 and landmark post-hardcore band Refused. More aggressive early hardcore punk bands include Asta Kask, Charta 77, Mob 47, Anti Cimex, Totalitär, Homy Hogs, T.S.T, Headcleaners, and The Shitlickers. Some later influential bands of the aggressive sort are for example Disfear, Driller Killer, Wolfbrigade, Loudpipes, Warvictims, Bombshell Rocks, and Raised Fist.

===Heavy metal===
Sweden (along with Scandinavia at large) is known for its large number of heavy metal bands, so much so that this phenomenon has attracted scholarly analysis. Sweden is second only to neighboring Finland in heavy metal bands per capita.

Swedish musicians were instrumental in the creation of melodic death metal, also known as Gothenburg metal, particularly the bands Arch Enemy, In Flames, At the Gates, and Dark Tranquility. These bands later developed their style further, adding new influences and inspiring other acts like the American melodic metalcore bands. Bathory is credited for helping create black metal, a style that became popular in Norway, as well as pioneering Viking metal, and deceased black metal icon Per Yngve Ohlin was from Sweden. Dissection is also noted for their large influence on Swedish black metal, in particular melodic black metal. The country is also well known for death metal, progressive, doom and power metal bands. Stockholm band Candlemass is one of the first and most influential doom metal bands, starting in 1984.
Yngwie J. Malmsteen is one of the fathers of neo-classical metal. Meshuggah is an avant-garde metal band which developed djent from the late 80s and 90s. Opeth is regarded as one of the most influential and innovative metal bands, crossing melodic death metal and progressive rock between the 90s and the 2000s. Passenger is considered the swan song of the nu metal scene in the early 2000s.
Other famous bands include Pain of Salvation, Entombed, Dismember, Hypocrisy, Amon Amarth, Amaranthe, Soilwork, Freak Kitchen, Sabaton and more.

Some of the prominent metal acts are:
Successful progressive/psychedelic acts are for example Bo Hansson, Dungen, Anekdoten, Morte Macabre, Opeth and Paatos. Finland and neighboring Norway are also crucial centers of controversial rock music genres, including black metal, death metal, and techno-rock movements since the 1980s and 1990s.

===Progressive and jazz-rock music===
Sweden is also known in some circles for its progressive and jazz-rock musicians, particularly for virtuoso-led acts including Andromeda, Anekdoten, Änglagård, Arbete och Fritid, Björn J:son Lindh, Bo Kaspers Orkester, Janne Schaffer, Kaipa, Landberk, Samla Mammas Manna, Opeth, The Flower Kings, and Beardfish. One of the most unusual progressive music artists in Sweden has been avant-garde singer iamamiwhoami.

====Progg====

During the 1970s, the progg (not to be confused with progressive rock) movement gained popularity. Progg, originally an abbreviation of &quot;progressiv musik&quot; (&quot;progressive music&quot;), was an umbrella term for much of the alternative music of this era. Some of those artists were progressive in a musical sense, such as Bo Hansson, Samla Mammas Manna and Träd, Gräs och Stenar. Others were progressive mainly in a political (usually left-wing) and lyrical sense, such as Nationalteatern, Blå Tåget and Hoola Bandoola Band.

===Reggae===
Reggae is also a major part of modern Swedish music. An early pioneer of Swedish reggae was Peps Persson, who Bob Marley once said was the only white man with reggae in his blood. Since then, more has happened. The Uppsala group Labyrint is widely spread with their musical mix of rap and reggae called förortsreggae. Swedish music producers Soundism are behind Swedish reggae artists Kapten Röd, Papa Dee, Million Stylez, and Chilly &amp; Leafy (and more), also records with international artist such as Junior Ketlly, Lady Saw, and Buju Banton.

===Electronic music===
Electronic music in Sweden has been heavily influenced by German electronic music. The EDM act Swedish House Mafia, consists of Steve Angello, Sebastian Ingrosso and Axwell, has topped house music charts and DJ top 10s around the world. In 2011, Avicii (real name Tim Bergling) was voted the 6th best DJ in the world in the Top 100 DJ poll. His music remained popular until his suicide in 2018. Other similar artists of note are John Dahlbäck, Manse, Eric Prydz, Nause, Albin Myers, the duo Dada Life, Galantis, Adrian Lux, Basshunter, Otto Knows, Alesso, Rebecca &amp; Fiona, Cazzette, Jakob Liedholm, Sebjak, AronChupa, Icona Pop, Will &amp; Dan, Brohug and Tjernberg.

Singer and producer Robyn has long been one of Sweden&#x27;s most prominent electropop acts. In the synth world, the band S.P.O.C.K has been active since the late 1980s. Secretive duo The Knife was highly rated among critics, and Sally Shapiro, is the pseudonym of producer Johan Agebjörn and a Swedish singer.

In the mid to late 2000s Swedish-language Eurodance &amp; Eurotrance dance music became internationally popular. In 2006, Basshunter became popular with his eurotrance dance songs, based on long-standing themes set in mid to late 2000s computer-centric culture. Little Dragon and Alcazar are also Swedish.

There are many techno producers from Sweden, though they are often better known internationally than within Sweden. There is even a special Swedish subgenre of techno, the best-known producer within this genre being Adam Beyer, head of the Drumcode label with notable artists such as Cari Lekebusch, Joel Mull, Henrik B, etc.

In addition, Sweden is one of the leading countries in the world when it comes to chiptunes, or bitpop. Chip music is music made to run on old game consoles and specialized PCs, like the Amiga, Commodore 64, or Game Boy; Other notable acts include Slagsmålsklubben, Crazy Q, Coma, Covox, Goto80, Maktone, Random, Wintergatan, Zabutom, The Knife, Zeigeist and Machinae Supremacy.Elektronmusikstudion (EMS), formerly known as Electroacoustic Music in Sweden, is the Swedish national centre for electronic music and sound art. The research organisation started in 1964 and is based in Stockholm.

<text>Muscarine, -(+)-muscarine, or muscarin is a natural product found in certain mushrooms, particularly in &quot;Inocybe&quot; and &quot;Clitocybe&quot; species, such as the deadly &quot;C. dealbata&quot;. Mushrooms in the genera &quot;Entoloma&quot; and &quot;Mycena&quot; have also been found to contain levels of muscarine which can be dangerous if ingested. Muscarine has been found in harmless trace amounts in &quot;Boletus&quot;, &quot;Hygrocybe&quot;, &quot;Lactarius&quot; and &quot;Russula&quot;. Trace concentrations of muscarine are also found in &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;, though the pharmacologically more relevant compound from this mushroom is the Z-drug-like alkaloid muscimol. &quot;A. muscaria&quot; fruitbodies contain a variable dose of muscarine, usually around 0.0003% fresh weight. This is very low and toxicity symptoms occur very rarely. &quot;Inocybe&quot; and &quot;Clitocybe&quot; contain muscarine concentrations up to 1.6%.

Muscarine is a selective agonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.

==History==
The name &quot;muscarine&quot; derives from that of &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;, from which it was first isolated, by German chemists Oswald Schmiedeberg and Richard Koppe at the University of Tartu, who reported their findings in 1869. The mushroom&#x27;s specific name in turn comes from the Latin for fly because the mushroom was often used to attract and catch flies, hence its common name, &quot;fly agaric&quot;.

Muscarine was the first parasympathomimetic substance ever studied and causes profound activation of the peripheral parasympathetic nervous system that may end in circulatory collapse and death. Being a quaternary ammonium salt, muscarine is less completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract than tertiary amines, and it does not cross the blood–brain barrier.
Muscarinic agonists activate muscarinic receptors while nicotinic agonists activate nicotine receptors. Both are direct-acting cholinomimetics; they produce their effects by binding to and activating cholinergic receptors.
Final proof of the structure was given by Franz Jellinek and colleagues in 1957 with the help of X-ray diffraction analysis; Jellinek further described the three-dimensional structure of the molecule using muscarine chloride. These new findings set into motion research on the pharmacology of muscarine and muscarine-like substances that are structurally related to acetylcholine.

==Structure and reactivity==
Muscarine mimics the function of the natural neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the muscarinic part of the cholinergic nervous system, despite the less flexible structure due to the five-membered ring in the molecular skeleton. With the exception of the double bonded oxygen, all of the acetylcholine structure is present in the right bottom side of muscarine (see &quot;Figure 3&quot; below for comparison of both structures).

There are two mirror forms of muscarine, named: 2S-muscarine and 2R-muscarine.
===Efficient synthesis of (+)-muscarine===
The scheme below represents a very efficient way of the synthesis of (+)-muscarine according to the scientists Chan and Li in the Canadian journal of Chemistry in 1992.
S-(−)-Ethyl lactate (2)(Figure 4) is converted into the 2,6-dichlorobenzyl ether (3). Diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL) reduction of the 2,6-dichlorobenzyl ether gives the aldehyde (4). Treatment of the crude aldehyde with allyl bromide and zinc powder in water with NH4Cl as catalyst resulted in an anti:syn mixture of 5a and 5b. Treatment of 5a with iodine in CH3CN at 0 °C gives the cyclized product 6a. Finally treatment of 6a with excess trimethylamine in ethanol gave (+)-muscarine (2S,4R,5S). A similar reaction sequence with 5b gave (+)-epimuscarine (7).
===Other Syntheses===
It can be synthesized in various ways from completely different substances, particularly from 2,5-dimethyl-3-carboxymethyl flurane.

== Pharmacology ==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Muscarine mimics the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine by agonising muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. These receptors were named after muscarine, to differentiate them from the other acetylcholine receptors (nicotinic receptors), which are comparatively unresponsive to muscarine. There are five different types of muscarinic receptors: M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5. Most tissues express a mixture of subtypes.

The M2 and M3 subtypes mediate muscarinic responses at peripheral autonomic tissues. M1 and M4 subtypes are more abundant in brain and autonomic ganglia.

The odd numbered receptors, M1, M3 and M5, interact with Gq proteins to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis and the release of intracellular calcium. Conversely, the even numbered receptors, M2 and M4, interact with Gi proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, which results in a decrease of intracellular concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).

Most agonists for muscarine receptors are not selective for subtypes.

Muscarinic receptors also signal via other pathways, for instance via G beta-gamma complex modulation of potassium channels. This allows muscarine to modulate cellular excitability via the membrane potential.

== Metabolism ==
A paucity of research exists on the metabolism of muscarine in the human body, suggesting this compound is not metabolized by humans. Though there has been extensive research in the field of acetylcholine metabolism by acetylcholinesterase, muscarine is not metabolized by this enzyme, partly explaining the compound&#x27;s potential toxicity. Muscarine is readily soluble in water. The most likely way for muscarine to leave the blood is via renal clearance; it will eventually leave the body in urine.

== Medical uses ==
Muscarinic agonists are used as drugs in treating glaucoma, postoperative ileus, congenital megacolon, urinary retention and xerostomia. Muscarine is contraindicated in people with diseases that make them susceptible to parasympathetic stimulation, people who have asthma or COPD, or people who have peptic ulcer disease. Also people with an obstruction in the gastrointestinal or urinary tract are not prescribed muscarine because it will aggravate the obstruction, causing pressure to build up that may lead to perforation.

== Efficacy ==
As muscarine works on the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, the best comparison can be made with acetylcholine, which normally works on this receptor. Pure muscarine compared to pure acetylcholine is stated in most cases to be more potent, its action is always slower but longer lasting than acetylcholine. A possible explanation for this long-lasting behavior might be that muscarine does not get hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft.

== Toxicology ==
Muscarine poisoning is characterized by miosis, blurred vision, increased salivation, excessive sweating, lacrimation, bronchial secretions, bronchoconstriction, bradycardia, abdominal cramping, increased gastric acid secretion, diarrhea and polyuria. If muscarine reaches the brain it can cause tremor, convulsions and hypothermia.
Cardiac ventricles contain muscarinic receptors that mediate a decrease in the force of contractions leading to a lower blood pressure. If muscarine is administered intravenously, muscarine can trigger acute circulatory failure with cardiac arrest.

The symptoms of intoxication with mushrooms rich in muscarine, especially &quot;Inocybe&quot;, are very typical:

The symptoms start early, after one-quarter to two hours, with headache, nausea, vomiting, and constriction of the pharynx. Then salivation, lacrimation, and diffuse perspiration set in, combined with miosis, disturbed accommodation, and reduced vision. Gastric and small bowel colic leads to diarrhea, and there is a painful urge for urination. Bronchoconstriction leads to asthmatic attacks and severe dyspnea, and bradycardia combined with marked hypotension and vasodilation results in circulatory shock. Death after 8 to 9 hours has been reported in about 5% of the cases, but can be avoided completely by prompt administration of IV or IM anticholinergic drugs.

== Antidote ==
Antimuscarinics such as atropine can be used as an antidote to muscarine. Atropine is, like muscarine, an alkaloid but unlike muscarine is an antagonist of the muscarinic receptors. Hence, it inhibits the effects of acetylcholine.

Muscarinic antagonists dilate the pupil and relax the ciliary muscle, are used in treatment of inflammatory uveitis and is associated with glaucoma. They are also used to treat urinary incontinence and diseases characterized by bowel hypermotility such as irritable bowel syndrome.

Muscarinic antagonists are often called parasympatholytics because they have the same effect as agents that block postganglionic parasympathetic nerves.
