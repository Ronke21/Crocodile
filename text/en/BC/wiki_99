<text>A sawshark or saw shark is a member of a shark order (Pristiophoriformes ) bearing a unique long, saw-like rostrum (snout or bill) edged with sharp teeth, which they use to slash and disable their prey. There are eight species within the Pristiophoriformes, including the longnose or common sawshark (&quot;Pristiophorus cirratus&quot;), shortnose sawshark (&quot;Pristiophorus nudipinnis&quot;), Japanese sawshark (&quot;Pristiophorus japonicas&quot;), Bahamas sawshark (&quot;Pristiophorus schroederi&quot;), sixgill sawshark (&quot;Pliotrema warreni&quot;), African dwarf sawshark (&quot;Pristiophorus nancyae&quot;), Lana&#x27;s sawshark (&quot;Pristiophorus lanae&quot;) and the tropical sawshark (&quot;Pristiophorus delicatus&quot;).

Sawsharks are found in many areas around the world, most commonly in waters from the Indian Ocean to the southern Pacific Ocean. They are normally found at depths around 40–100 m, but can be found much lower in tropical regions. The Bahamas sawshark was discovered in deeper waters (640 m to 915 m) of the northwestern Caribbean.

==Description and life cycle==

Sawsharks have a pair of long barbels about halfway along the snout. They have two dorsal fins, but lack anal fins. Genus &quot;Pliotrema&quot; has six gill slits, and &quot;Pristiophorus&quot; the more usual five. The teeth of the saw typically alternate between large and small. Saw sharks reach a length of up to 5 feet and a weight of 18.7 pounds, with females tending to be slightly larger than males.

The body of a longnose saw shark is covered in tiny placoid scales: modified teeth covered in hard enamel. The body is a yellow-brown color which is sometimes covered in dark spots or blotches. This coloration allows the saw shark to easily blend with the sandy ocean floor.

These sharks typically feed on small fish, squid, and crustaceans, depending on species. The function of the sawshark barbels are not well understood, and neither is how they use their rostrum. It is possible they use it in a similar fashion as sawfishes, and hit prey with side-to-side swipes of the saw, crippling them. The saw could also be utilized against other predators in defense. The saw is covered with specialized sensory organs (ampullae of Lorenzini) which detect an electric field which is given off by buried prey.

Saw sharks life history is still poorly understood. Mating season occurs seasonally in coastal areas. Saw sharks are ovoviviparous meaning eggs hatch inside the mother. They have litters of 3–22 pups every 2 years. After 12 months of pregnancy, the pups are born at 30 cm long. While in the mother, pups&#x27; rostral teeth are angled backwards to avoid harming the mother. The life expectancy of sawsharks is still poorly understood, but they are thought to live to 10 years or more.

== Human interaction ==
Among the different species of sawshark, all are listed on the IUCN Red List of 2017 as either data deficient or of least concern Saw sharks do not see much human interaction because of their deep habitats. 

== Species ==

There are currently ten known species of sawsharks across two genera in this family:

**&quot;Pristiophorus schroederi&quot; (Bahamas sawshark)

=== Sixgill sawshark ===
The sixgill sawshark (&quot;Pliotrema warreni&quot;) is known for its six pairs of gills located on its sides close to the head. They are pale brown in color, with a white underbelly. Along with their color, their size sets them apart from the other types of sawfish: The females are around 136 cm where the males are around 112 cm. Sixgill sawsharks feed on shrimp, squid and bony fish. They are located around the southern portion of South Africa, and Madagascar. Where found, they are considered a prize catch. They dwell in the rage of 37–500 m, preferring to stay in the warmer water. They have between 5 and 7 pups from 7–17 eggs. They have these young in the range of 37–50 m deep to make sure the pups are warm.

=== Longnose or common sawshark ===
The longnose sawshark aka the common sawshark (&quot;Pristiophorus cirratus&quot;) is one of 9 species within the family Pristiophoridae. It has unique physical characteristics which include a long, thin, and flattened snout. Midway down the snout, nasal barbels protrude on both sides of the snout. Near the barbels, the longnose sawshark possesses a pair of ampullae of Lorenzini. It is unique among the sawshark family by having a longer snout than any of its counter species. The longnose sawshark is not very large with lengths ranging from around 14 inches at birth to 38 inches in males and 44 inches in females. They can also grow to a weight of 18.7 pounds. They are known to swim in the waters off the southern coast of Australia&#x27;s continental shelf. They can also be found in the eastern portion of the Indian Ocean. The longnose sawshark prefers to swim in both the open sea and coastal regions from the surface to a depth of 600m. The longnose Sawshark is known to mainly prey on small crustaceans. It uses its barbels to detect prey on the ocean floor which it then hits with its snout to immobilize it. Like all other sawsharks, the common sawshark has a long snout with rows of small teeth and barbels on either side. It has five gill slits on either side of its head and between 19 and 25 teeth on each side. Sawsharks appear to be one of the types of elasmobranch that are difficult or impossible to age using most commonly-used approaches that rely on vertebral banding.

=== Shortnose or southern sawshark ===
The shortnose sawshark aka the southern sawshark (&quot;Pristiophorus nudipinnis&quot;) is found in south-eastern Australian waters. Much of its distribution overlaps with that of the Common sawshark, however, it seems to occur less frequently. This species is similar in size as the common sawshark, but has a broader rostrum (saw) and a more even brown coloration. It also grows to be heavier than the common sawshark. Since the color pattern of the common sawshark may be more or less defined, the easiest way to separate this species from the common sawshark is the location of the barbels, which are closer to the mouth than the co-occurring common sawshark. Unlike the common sawshark, the southern sawshark likely feeds mainly on fishes.

=== Tropical sawshark ===
The tropical sawshark (&quot;Pristiophorus delicatus&quot;) a pale brown with a yellow hue, and an underbelly that is a pale yellow to white. This deep water dwelling fish is located off the Northeastern shore of Australia, in depths up to 176–405 m. It averages in size at about 95 cm. Other than its location and appearance little is known of the creature; it is hard to catch due to its ability to travel into the depths of the ocean.

=== Japanese sawshark ===
The Japanese sawshark (&quot;Pristiophorus japonicus&quot;) is a species of sawshark that lives off the coast of Japan, Korea, and Northern China. It swims at a depth of 500 m. It has around 15–26 large rostral teeth in front of the barbels, which are equal distance from the gills to the snout, and about 9–17 teeth behind the barbels. Like all sawsharks, the Japanese sawshark is ovoviviparous, and feeds on crustaceans and bottom dwelling organisms.

=== Lana&#x27;s sawshark ===
Lana&#x27;s sawshark (&quot;Pristiophorus lanae&quot;) is a species of sawshark that inhabits the Philippine coast. It was discovered in 1966 by Dave Ebert, who distinguished it as a new species of sawshark based on its number of rostral teeth. Lana&#x27;s sawshark was named after Lana Ebert on the occasion of her graduation from the University of Francisco. It has a dark uniform brown color on the dorsal side and a pale white on the ventral side. It is slender bodied, has five gills on each side, and can grow to be around 70 cm.

=== African dwarf sawshark ===
The African dwarf sawshark (&quot;Pristiophorus nancyae&quot;) is a small five-gill sawshark that lives off the coast of Mozambique. It was first discovered in 2011 when a specimen was caught off the coast of Mozambique at a depth of 1,600 ft. The African dwarf sawshark has since then been spotted off the coasts of Kenya and Yemen. It can be distinguished from other sawsharks by its location, and by having its barbels closer to its mouth than the end of its rostrum. It has a brownish grey color and becomes white along the ventral side. Little else is known about the African Dwarf Sawshark as it is a newly discovered species.

=== Shortnose sawshark ===
The shortnose sawshark (&quot;Pristiophorus nudipinnis&quot;) is similar to the longnose sawshark; however, it has a slightly compressed body and shorter more narrow rostrum. It has 13 teeth in front of its barbels and 6 behind. The shortnose sawshark tends to be uniformly slate grey with no markings on its dorsal side and pale white or cream on its ventral side. Females reach around 124 cm (49 in) long, and males reach around 110 cm (43 in) long. These sharks can live to be up to 9 years old. Like other sawsharks, the Short Nose lives a benthic lifestyle and feeds on benthic invertebrates. It uses its barbels to detect life on the ocean floor which it then paralyzes with its rostrum. The species is ovoviviparous and tends to give birth to a litter of 7–14 pups biannually. It inhabits ocean floors off the coast of Australia.

=== Bahamas sawshark ===
The Bahamas sawsharks (&quot;Pristiophorus schroeder&quot;) have very little information on them. Studies are being done daily to learn more about the deep sea dweller. They are located near Cuba, Florida, and the Bahamas (hence their name) where they dwell in the depths of 400–1000 m. As far as their appearance they can be identified by their snouts with teeth which appear as a saw, as well as their length, they are averaged at 80 cm in length.

==Comparison with sawfish==
Saw sharks and sawfish are cartilaginous fish possessing large saws. These are the only two fish that have a long blade-like snout. Although they are similar in appearances, saw sharks are distinct from sawfish. Sawfish are not sharks, but a type of ray. The gill slits of the sawfishes are positioned on the underside like a ray, but the gill slits of the saw shark are positioned on the side like a shark. Sawfish can have a much larger size, lack barbels, and have evenly sized teeth rather than alternating teeth of the saw shark. Clear difference is that a sawfish has no barbels and a saw shark has a prominent pair halfway along the saw. The saw shark uses these like other bottom fish, as a kind of antennae, feeling the way along the ocean bottom until it finds some prey of interest. Both the saw shark and the sawfish utilize the electroreceptors on the saw, ampullae of Lorenzini, to detect the electric field given off by buried prey.

<doc id="255090" wikidata="Q444698" url="?curid=255090" title="Operation Paperclip">
<text>Operation Paperclip was a secret United States intelligence program in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians were taken from former Nazi Germany to the US for government employment after the end of World War II in Europe, between 1945 and 1959; several were confirmed to be former members of the Nazi Party, including the SS or the SA.

The effort began in earnest in 1945, as the Allies advanced into Germany and discovered a wealth of scientific talent and advanced research that had contributed to Germany&#x27;s wartime technological advancements. The US Joint Chiefs of Staff officially established Operation Overcast (operations &quot;Overcast&quot; and &quot;Paperclip&quot; were related, and the terms are often used interchangeably) on July 20, 1945, with the dual aims of leveraging German expertise for the ongoing war effort against Japan and to bolster US postwar military research. The operation, conducted by the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA), was largely actioned by special agents of the US Army&#x27;s Counterintelligence Corps (CIC). Many selected scientists were involved in the Nazi rocket program, aviation, or chemical/biological warfare. The Soviet Union in the following year conducted a similar program, called Operation Osoaviakhim, that emphasized many of the same fields of research.

The operation, characterized by the recruitment of German specialists and their families, relocated more than 1600 experts to the US. It has been valued at US$10 billion in patents and industrial processes. Recruits included such notable figures as Wernher von Braun, a leading rocket-technology scientist. Those recruited were instrumental in the development of the US space program and military technology during the Cold War. Despite its contributions to American scientific advances, Operation Paperclip has been controversial because of the Nazi affiliations of many recruits, and the ethics of assimilating individuals associated with war crimes into American society.

The operation was not solely focused on rocketry; efforts were directed toward synthetic fuels, medicine, and other fields of research. Notable advances in aeronautics fostered rocket and space-flight technologies pivotal in the Space Race. The operation played a crucial role in the establishment of NASA and the success of the Apollo missions to the Moon.

Operation Paperclip was part of a broader strategy by the US to harness German scientific talent in the face of emerging Cold War tensions, and ensuring this expertise did not fall into the hands of the Soviet Union or other nations. The operation&#x27;s legacy has remained controversial in subsequent decades.

==Background and Operation Overcast==
In February 1945, Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) set up T-Force, or Special Sections Subdivision, which grew to over 2,000 personnel by June. T-Force examined 5,000 German targets, seeking expertise in synthetic rubber and oil catalysts, new designs in armored equipment, V-2 (rocket) weapons, jet and rocket propelled aircraft, naval equipment, field radios, secret writing chemicals, aero medicine research, gliders, and &quot;scientific and industrial personalities&quot;.

When large numbers of German scientists began to be discovered by the advancing Allied forces in late April 1945, the Special Sections Subdivision set up the Enemy Personnel Exploitation Section to manage and interrogate them. The Enemy Personnel Exploitation Section established a detention center, Camp Dustbin, first near Paris and later in Kransberg Castle outside Frankfurt. The US Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) established the first secret recruitment program, called Operation Overcast, on July 20, 1945, initially &quot;to assist in shortening the Japanese war and to aid our postwar military research&quot;. The term &quot;Overcast&quot; was the name first given by the German scientists&#x27; family members for the housing camp where they were held in Bavaria. In late summer 1945, the JCS established the JIOA, a subcommittee of the Joint Intelligence Community, to directly oversee Operation Overcast and later Operation Paperclip. The JIOA representatives included the army&#x27;s director of intelligence, the chief of naval intelligence, the assistant chief of Air Staff-2 (air force intelligence), and a representative from the State Department. In November 1945, Operation Overcast was renamed Operation Paperclip by Ordnance Corps officers, who would attach a paperclip to the folders of those rocket experts whom they wished to employ in the United States.

The project was not initially targeted against the Soviet Union; rather the concern was that German scientists might emigrate and continue their research in countries that remained neutral during the war. Much US effort was focused on Saxony and Thuringia, which on July 1, 1945, became part of the Soviet occupation zone. Many German research facilities and personnel had been evacuated to these states before the end of the war, particularly from the Berlin area. The USSR then relocated more than 2,200 Nazi specialists and their families—more than 6,000 people—with Operation Osoaviakhim during one night on October 22, 1946.

In a secret directive circulated on September 3, 1946, President Truman officially approved Operation Paperclip and expanded it to include 1,000 German scientists under &quot;temporary, limited military custody&quot;. News media revealed the program as early as December 1946.

On April 26, 1946, the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued directive JCS 1067/14 to General Eisenhower instructing that he &quot;preserve from destruction and take under your control records, plans, books, documents, papers, files and scientific, industrial and other information and data belonging to ... German organizations engaged in military research&quot;; and that, excepting war-criminals, German scientists be detained for intelligence purposes as required.

==Osenberg List==
In the later part of World War II, Germany was at a logistical disadvantage, having failed to conquer the USSR with Operation Barbarossa (June–December 1941), and its drive for the Caucasus (June 1942 – February 1943). The failed conquest had depleted German resources, and its military–industrial complex was unprepared to defend the Greater Germanic Reich against the Red Army&#x27;s westward counterattack. By early 1943, the German government began recalling from combat a number of scientists, engineers, and technicians to work in research and development to bolster German defense for a protracted war with the USSR. The recall from frontline combat included 4,000 rocketeers returned to Peenemünde, in northeast coastal Germany.

The Nazi government&#x27;s recall of their now-useful intellectuals for scientific work first required identifying and locating the scientists, engineers, and technicians, then ascertaining their political and ideological reliability. Werner Osenberg, the engineer-scientist heading the &quot;Wehrforschungsgemeinschaft&quot; (Defense Research Association), recorded the names of the politically cleared men to the Osenberg List, thus reinstating them to scientific work.

In March 1945, at Bonn University, a Polish laboratory technician found pieces of the Osenberg List stuffed in a toilet; the list subsequently reached MI6, who transmitted it to US intelligence. Then US Army Major Robert B. Staver, Chief of the Jet Propulsion Section of the Research and Intelligence Branch of the United States Army Ordnance Corps, used the Osenberg List to compile his list of German scientists to be captured and interrogated; Wernher von Braun, Germany&#x27;s best rocket scientist, headed Major Staver&#x27;s list.

==Identification==
In Operation Overcast, Major Staver&#x27;s original intent was only to interview the scientists, but what he learned changed the operation&#x27;s purpose. On May 22, 1945, he transmitted to the US Department of War Colonel Joel Holmes&#x27; telegram urging the evacuation to America of 100 of the 400 German scientists in his custody, as most &quot;important for [the] Pacific war&quot; effort. Most of the Osenberg List engineers worked at the Baltic coast German Army Research Center Peenemünde, developing the V-2 rocket. After capturing them, the Allies initially housed them and their families in Landshut, Bavaria, in southern Germany.

Beginning on July 19, 1945, the US Joint Chiefs managed the captured ARC rocketeers under Operation Overcast. However, when the &quot;Camp Overcast&quot; name of the scientists&#x27; quarters became locally known, the program was renamed Operation Paperclip in November 1945. Despite these attempts at secrecy, the press interviewed several of the scientists later that year.

==Capture and detention==
Early on, the United States created the Combined Intelligence Objectives Subcommittee (CIOS). This provided the information on targets for the T-Forces that went in and targeted scientific, military, and industrial installations (and their employees) for their know-how. Initial priorities were advanced technology, such as infrared, that could be used in the war against Japan; finding out what technology had been passed on to Japan; and finally to halt research elsewhere.

Von Braun and more than a thousand of his colleagues decided to surrender to Americans in 1945. One of the engineers later recalled their options: &quot;We despise the French, we are mortally afraid of the Soviets, we do not believe the British can afford us. So that leaves the Americans.&quot; On June 20, 1945, they moved from the east closer to the American forces, to avoid the advancing Soviet army.

A project to halt the research was codenamed &quot;Project Safehaven&quot;; it was not initially targeted against the Soviet Union but addressed the concern that German scientists might emigrate and continue their research in countries that had remained neutral during the war. To avoid the complications involved with the emigration of German scientists, the CIOS was responsible for scouting and kidnapping high-profile individuals to block technological advancements in nations hostile to the US.

Much US effort was focused on Saxony and Thuringia, which on July 1, 1945, would become part of the Soviet Occupation zone. Many German research facilities and personnel had been evacuated to these states, particularly from the Berlin area. Fearing that the Soviet takeover would limit US ability to exploit German scientific and technical expertise, and not wanting the Soviet Union to benefit from it, the United States instigated an &quot;evacuation operation&quot; of scientific personnel from Saxony and Thuringia, issuing orders such as:

By 1947, this evacuation operation had netted an estimated 1,800 technicians and scientists and 3,700 family members. Those with special skills or knowledge were taken to detention and interrogation centers, such as one code-named &quot;Dustbin&quot; (located first at Chesnay, near Versailles and then moved to Kransberg Castle outside Frankfurt) to be held and interrogated, in some cases for months.

A few of the scientists were gathered as a part of Operation Overcast, but most were transported to villages in the countryside where there were neither research facilities nor work; they were provided with stipends, and required to report twice weekly to police headquarters to prevent them from leaving. The Joint Chiefs of Staff directive on research and teaching stated that technicians and scientists should be released &quot;only after all interested agencies were satisfied that all desired intelligence information had been obtained from them&quot;.

On November 5, 1947, the Office of Military Government, United States (OMGUS), which had jurisdiction over the western part of occupied Germany, held a conference to consider the status of the evacuees, the monetary claims that the evacuees had filed against the United States, and the &quot;possible violation by the US of laws of war or Rules of Land Warfare&quot;. The OMGUS director of Intelligence Robert L. Walsh initiated a program to resettle the evacuees in the Third World, which the Germans referred to as General Walsh&#x27;s (&quot;jungle program&quot;); but the program was not carried out. In 1948, the evacuees received settlements of 69.5 million Reichsmarks from the US, a settlement that soon became severely devalued during the currency reform that introduced the Deutsche Mark as the official currency of western Germany.

John Gimbel concludes that the United States held some of Germany&#x27;s best minds for three years, therefore depriving the German recovery of their expertise.

==Arrivals==

In May 1945, the US Navy &quot;received in custody&quot; Herbert A. Wagner, the inventor of the Hs 293 missile; for two years, he first worked at the Special Devices Center, at Castle Gould and at Hempstead House, Long Island, New York; in 1947, he moved to the Naval Air Station Point Mugu.

In August 1945, Colonel Holger Toftoy, head of the Rocket Branch of the Research and Development Division of the US Army&#x27;s Ordnance Corps, offered initial one-year contracts to the rocket scientists; 127 of them accepted. In September 1945, the first group of seven rocket scientists (aerospace engineers) arrived at Fort Strong on Long Island in Boston harbor: Wernher von Braun, Erich W. Neubert, Theodor A. Poppel, William August Schulze, Eberhard Rees, Wilhelm Jungert, and Walter Schwidetzky.

Beginning in late 1945, three rocket-scientist groups arrived in the United States for duty at Fort Bliss, Texas, and at White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico, as &quot;War Department Special Employees&quot;.

In 1946, the United States Bureau of Mines employed seven German synthetic fuel scientists at a Fischer–Tropsch chemical plant in Louisiana, Missouri.

On June 1, 1949, the Chief of Ordnance of the United States Army designated Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, as the Ordnance Rocket Center, its facility for rocket research and development. On April 1, 1950, the Fort Bliss missile development operation, including von Braun and his team of over 130 Paperclip members, was transferred to Redstone Arsenal.

In early 1950, legal US residency for some of the Project Paperclip specialists was effected through the US consulate in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico; thus, German scientists legally entered the United States from Latin America.

Between 1945 and 1952, the United States Air Force sponsored the largest number of Paperclip scientists, importing 260 men, of whom 36 returned to Germany, and one, Walter Schreiber, emigrated to Argentina.

The United States Army Signal Corps employed 24 specialists—including the physicists Georg Goubau, Gunter Guttwein, Georg Hass, Horst Kedesdy, and Kurt Lehovec; the physical chemists Rudolf Brill, , and Eberhard Both; the geophysicist Helmut Weickmann; the optician Gerhard Schwesinger; and the engineers Eduard Gerber, Richard Guenther, and Hans Ziegler.

In 1959, 94 Operation Paperclip men went to the United States, including Friedwardt Winterberg and Friedrich Wigand.

Overall, through its operations to 1990, Operation Paperclip imported 1,600 men as part of the &quot;intellectual reparations&quot; owed to the US and the UK, valued at US$10 billion in patents and industrial processes.

==Major awards (in the United States)==
The NASA Distinguished Service Medal is the highest award which may be bestowed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). After more than two decades of service and leadership in NASA, four Nazi members from Operation Paperclip were awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1969: Kurt Debus, Eberhard Rees, Arthur Rudolph, and Wernher von Braun. Ernst Geissler was awarded the medal in 1973.

The Department of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award is the highest civilian award given by the United States Department of Defense. After two decades of service, Nazi member from Operation Paperclip Siegfried Knemeyer was awarded the Department of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award in 1966.

The Goddard Astronautics Award is the highest honor bestowed for notable achievements in the field of astronautics by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). For their service, three Operation Paperclip members were awarded the Goddard Astronautics Award: Wernher von Braun (1961), Hans von Ohain (1966), and Krafft Arnold Ehricke (1984).

The US Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama, owns and operates the US Space Camp. Several Operation Paperclip members are members of the Space Camp Hall of Fame (which began in 2007): Wernher von Braun (2007), Georg von Tiesenhausen (2007), and Oscar Holderer (2008).

The New Mexico Museum of Space History includes the International Space Hall of Fame. Two Operation Paperclip members are members of the International Space Hall of Fame: Wernher von Braun (1976) and Ernst Steinhoff (1979). Hubertus Strughold was inducted in 1978 but removed as a member in 2006. Other closely related members include Willy Ley (1976), a German-American science writer, and Hermann Oberth (1976), a German scientist who advised von Braun&#x27;s rocket team in the US from 1955 to 1958; neither Ley, nor Oberth moved to the US via the Operation Paperclip.

Two lunar craters are named after Paperclip scientists: Debus after Kurt Debus, the first director of NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center, and von Braun.

==Advancements in aeronautics==

=== Significant migrants ===
==== Adolf Busemann ====
Dr. Adolf Busemann was born in Lubeck, Germany, in 1902. He graduated from the Carolo Wilhelmina Technical University in Braunschweig and received a Ph.D. in engineering in 1924. In 1925, the Max-Planck Institute invited him to become an official aeronautical research scientist, and in 1930, he became a professor at Georgia Augusta University in Goettingen.

Busemann spent many years working for the German government, most notably directing research at the Braunschweig Laboratory. He gave a speech in 1935 at the Volta Congress, an international meeting on the problems of high-speed aeronautics. At this conference, he presented his first theory of how the angle of sweep of a plane wing reduces drag at supersonic speed. After the war, he traveled to the United States to assist them with the war tensions with Russia, where he continued his work on his theory of wing sweep.

==== Wernher von Braun ====
Wernher von Braun is known for developing rocket and space-flight technology, including the V-2 missile. In late 1932, he worked for the German army to develop new liquid propulsion-based missiles. He received a doctorate in physics in 1934 from the Friedrich-Wilhelms University of Berlin. He and his team then surrendered to the Allies at the end of World War II, shortly after Hitler&#x27;s suicide in 1945. They were brought to America through Operation Paperclip and assimilated into NASA&#x27;s space program, where they worked on missile technology at Fort Bliss before transferring to Huntsville, Alabama. He became the director of the Marshall Space Flight Center in 1960.

Von Braun is also a controversial figure for his involvement with the Nazi party and the slave labor involved in developing the V-2 rocket in Germany before it began to be developed in the United States. He became a member of the Nazi party in 1937 and was made a junior SS officer in 1940.

=== Marshall Space Flight Center ===
In July 1960, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) established the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama after taking control of the Development Operations Division from the Army&#x27;s Redstone Arsenal. The Redstone Arsenal was led by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency. Wernher von Braun became the first director of the MSFC. The MSFC&#x27;s development team was formed by American engineers from the Redstone Arsenal and 118 German migrants who came from Peenemünde through Operation Paperclip. Von Braun worked with Operation Paperclip to get scientists from his team to the United States. They began work at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas in September 1945, and most of the team had arrived by 1946. Von Braun and his team worked as consultants for the military until 1950 when they began transferring to Huntsville.

Originally, the center focused on weaponry and further development of the V-2 rocket line but later became one of NASA&#x27;s main development centers for space flight project. The team also worked on missions that related to Moon landing missions, such as the Lunar Roving Vehicle. However, the main projects from the Marshall Space Flight Center were the V-2 rocket and the Apollo missions.

==== V-2 rocket ====


The V-2 rocket was developed in Germany at the Peenemünde military research center. Wernher von Braun was the director of Peenemünde and worked with a team of engineers, physicists, and chemists. The Nazis used the V-2 missile during World War II to attack Paris, the port of Antwerp, and Great Britain, among many other targets. Roughly five thousand people died in these attacks. The location of V-2 production moved to Mittelwerk in Nordhausen after a British raid on Peenemünde on August 17, 1943. Mittelwerk was supplemented with slave labor from Dora, a nearby concentration camp.

Production of the V-2 missile moved to the United States after Wernher von Braun surrendered to the Allies (Hall 2022). In March 1946, a V-2 was test-fired in New Mexico, followed by the first launch of a captured V-2 in April of the same year. After months of adaptation, a V-2 missile was fired in White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico that broke a record with an altitude of . The V-2 rockets were used to test the effects of cosmic rays on fruit flies and seeds. They also took the first pictures of Earth from in the air and tested g-force on various monkeys.

==== Apollo missions ====
The Marshall Space Flight Center was one of three institutions at NASA involved in the Apollo program. The center was equipped to become a part of Apollo because it had the facilities to study rocketry: Aero-Astrodynamics, Astrionics, Space Sciences, Propulsion and Vehicle Engineering, Computation, Manufacturing, Test, and Quality. Each of these laboratories handled a different aspect of creating and testing rockets that suited the shift from military weapons to space travel. The weaponry from WWII, including rocket and missile in the United States, set the precedent for the kinds of technology used to create the Saturn rocket line. The Marshall engineers&#x27; experience in rocket development led to what Dieter Grau, head of the Quality lab, described as a &quot;rigid inspection program&quot; focused on craftsmanship. This meant to create prototypes that had a higher success rate instead of lesser prototypes that required more tests.

The American and German Marshall engineers created the launch vehicles and designed some launching facilities at Cape Canaveral, Florida during the Apollo program. They also created the Saturn rocket line, which was the kind of rocket that sent American astronauts to the Moon. The Saturn rocket line drew on previous military engineering, such as the liquid propulsion system developed from von Braun&#x27;s V-2 rocket and navigation systems derived from the US army&#x27;s Redstone and Jupiter rockets.

==Controversy and investigations==
Before his official approval of the program, President Truman was indecisive about it for sixteen months. Years later in 1963, Truman recalled that he was not in the least reluctant to approve Paperclip; that because of relations with the Soviet Union &quot;this had to be done and was done&quot;.
Several of the Paperclip scientists were later investigated because of their links with the Nazi Party during the war. Only one Paperclip scientist, Georg Rickhey, was formally tried for any crime, and no Paperclip scientist was found guilty of any crime, in the United States or Germany. Rickhey was returned to Germany in 1947 to stand at the Dora Trial, where he was acquitted.

In 1951, weeks after his US arrival, Walter Schreiber was linked by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; to human experiments conducted by Kurt Blome at Ravensbrück; he emigrated to Argentina with the aid of the US military.

In 1984, Arthur Rudolph, under perceived threat of prosecution relating to his connection – as operations director for V-2 missile production – to the use of forced labor from Mittelbau-Dora at the Mittelwerk, renounced his US citizenship and moved to West Germany, which granted him citizenship. Von Braun was investigated in 1961 for his involvement in the Nazi party as an SS member. The FBI concluded that he had joined the Nazi Party solely to advance his academic career and to avoid imprisonment.

For 50 years, from 1963 to 2013, the Strughold Award – named after Hubertus Strughold, &quot;the father of space medicine&quot;, for his central role in developing innovations like the space suit and space life support systems – was the most prestigious award from the Space Medicine Association, a member organization of the Aerospace Medical Association. On October 1, 2013, in the aftermath of a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article published on December 1, 2012, which highlighted his connection to human experiments during WWII, the Space Medicine Association&#x27;s executive committee announced that the Space Medicine Association Strughold Award had been retired.

In a 2014 book, Annie Jacobsen investigated 21 prominent scientists and technicians recruited by Paperclip, and found that 15 were active Nazi party members. 10 served in paramilitary groups like the SS or the SA, 8 worked directly with major Nazi leaders, and 6 were tried at Nuremberg.

<doc id="255092" wikidata="Q4875654" url="?curid=255092" title="Bea (Dennis the Menace)">
<text>Beatrice &quot;Bea&quot; Menace is a fictional character from the British comic magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;. She was born in issue 2931 (introduced by David Parkins) and is the baby sister of Dennis the Menace. She appears frequently in her brother&#x27;s comic strip, but would receive comic strips of her own to star in, including a crossover comic strip with Ivy the Terrible.

She is very flatulent and often farts. She uses her farts as a way of menacing.

==Physical appearance==
Bea&#x27;s appearance is extremely similar to her elder brother&#x27;s in that she sports short jet-black messy hair and a behind the nose grin. She is a toddler who wears a striped yellow and black onesie with a short ponytail with a yellow hair band to match. After the 2009 re-launch of &quot;Dennis and Gnasher&quot;, eyelashes were added to her appearance and she became far more baby-like in not only looks but also personality.

David Parkins had always intended that the character would be called &quot;Bea&quot; (short for Beatrice), but the comic staff decided to put the name up for a reader vote. The readers seemed to agree with Parkins, as &quot;Bea&quot; won the vote by a nearly two-thirds majority. Dennis&#x27; Mum regularly shouts, &quot;Bea! No!&quot; whenever she misbehaves.

==Publication history==
===Introduction to &quot;The Beano&quot;===
As part of &quot;The Beano&quot; 65th anniversary, issue 2925 teased a &quot;big surprise&quot;. Five issues later, Dennis&#x27; parents announced his mother was pregnant, making Dennis faint in shock, but ended on a cliffhanger as his mother went into labour and rushed to the nearby hospital. The front cover of the following issue showed Dennis&#x27; delighted father rushing out of the maternity ward to tell his son (and Gnasher) &quot;It&#x27;s a girl!&quot; The story inside showed Dennis and Gnasher&#x27;s worry that a little sister would mean constant crying, baby toys all over the house, and that she could grow up to be an ultra-feminine little girl obsessed with makeup and perfume, who over-occupies the bathroom. The final panels reveal he has nothing to worry about as Walter takes a family photo that shows Bea kicking her father in the mouth and spraying her mother with a milk bottle. She would later win the vote for naughtiest baby in Beanotown at a week old.

===Solo stories===
In issue 2935, Bea starred in &quot;Beaginnings&quot; drawn by Nigel Parkinson. It was about her misbehaviour at home, saying her first word (&quot;mud&quot;) and playing with her older brother&#x27;s pets. The title changed to &quot;Dennis&#x27;s Little Sister Bea – the Mini-Menace&quot; from issue 3099, but was also known as &quot;Bea&quot;. She shares notable similarities with fellow &quot;Beano&quot; character, Ivy the Terrible, who, from August 2008, joined Bea in her strip, renamed &quot;Bea and Ivy&quot;. Nigel Parkinson continued as artist, as Ivy had been reprinted before the team up.

Bea&#x27;s own strip returned for a few issues in 2009, however, this was dropped later that year, mainly due to her older brother&#x27;s relaunch. In 2010 Bea joined up with Gnipper and Harley, Gran&#x27;s pet pig, in a new strip titled &quot;The Bea Team&quot;, the title being a parody of &quot;The A-Team&quot; film which was released around the time the strip was in &quot;The Beano&quot;. In 2014, Bea returned to her strip drawn by Nigel Parkinson.

===Subsequent appearances===
Issue 2942 (5 December 1998) was a special issue dedicated to her, where she appeared in every strip in the comic.

Bea makes appearances in the CBBC series &quot;Dennis the Menace and Gnasher&quot;.

<text>FoxTrot is an American comic strip written and illustrated by Bill Amend. The strip launched on April 10, 1988, and it originally ran seven days a week. From December 31, 2006 onwards, &quot;FoxTrot&quot; has only appeared on Sundays.

The strip revolves around the daily lives of the Fox family, composed of parents Andrea (Andy) and Roger and their children, Peter, Paige, and Jason. It covers a wide range of subject matter, including spoofs of pop culture fads, nerd culture, complex math, and popular consumer products.

== Publication history ==
Cartoonist Bill Amend states that after he submitted strips for three years, in 1987 Universal Press Syndicate (UPS) offered him a contract.
&quot;FoxTrot&quot; was first syndicated by UPS on April 10, 1988.

On December 5, 2006, Universal Press Syndicate issued a press release stating that Amend&#x27;s strip, &quot;FoxTrot&quot;, would turn into a Sunday-only strip and the comic confirming it was on December 25 2006 just 20 days later. Amend stated that he wanted to continue doing the strip, but at a less hurried pace. This news was followed by a week-long arc of the characters discussing a &quot;cartoonist&quot; semi-retiring to Sundays only, and what methods he would use to phase out the daily strips. The last daily strip was shown on December 30, 2006. At the end of its run as a daily comic, &quot;FoxTrot&quot; was carried by more than 1,200 newspapers worldwide. Since moving to one comic every week, Amend has said that it&#x27;s harder to remain topical because Sunday&#x27;s deadline is 30 days ahead of publication, compared with just 10-day deadlines the rest of the week. Amend and fellow cartoonist Stephan Pastis joked that Amend switched to a Sundays-only schedule &quot;so he could spend 18 hours a day playing World of Warcraft.&quot;

==Characters and story==

&quot;FoxTrot&quot; takes place with the daily lives of the Foxes, a suburban family, composed of father Roger, mother Andrea (Andy), and their children: Peter (age 16), Paige (14), and Jason (10), who live together. The Fox family lives in a suburban setting. Amend has said he has never specified where the Foxes live, and he has shown them taking vacations to the desert and various amusement parks and campgrounds.

Amend majored in physics at Amherst College, and his knowledge on the subject is sometimes reflected in &quot;FoxTrot&quot;″s frequent inclusion of complex mathematical or physics formulae, usually written by Jason, whom Amend described as &quot;largely an exaggerated representation of [his] own geeky nature.&quot; Jason is also used to express Amend&#x27;s knowledge of computer languages.

Recurring characters include Jason&#x27;s pet iguana Quincy; Jason&#x27;s friend Marcus and his classmate Eileen Jacobson; Paige&#x27;s friend Nicole and her classmate Morton Goldthwait; Peter&#x27;s blind girlfriend, Denise, and his friend Steve; and other friends and classmates of the children and Roger&#x27;s co-workers. Like many comic strips, &quot;FoxTrot&quot; employs a floating timeline &quot;for specific reasons and to create specific dynamics between [Peter, Paige, and Jason].&quot;

==Books==

The strips have been printed in 45 different books, all by Andrews McMeel Publishing. Of the 45 books, 31 are collections and 14 are anthologies. The anthologies are composed of the two or three previous collections and include Sunday strips in color.

===Merchandising===
During the late 1990s, the character of Jason Fox was licensed to Wolfram Research as a product mascot for its mathematica software package.

<text>The Stavka (Russian and Ukrainian: Ставка, Belarusian: Стаўка) is a name of the high command of the armed forces used formerly in the Russian Empire and Soviet Union and currently in Ukraine.

In Imperial Russia &quot;Stavka&quot; referred to the administrative staff, and to the General Headquarters in the late 19th-century Imperial Russian armed forces and subsequently in the Soviet Union. In Western literature it is sometimes written in uppercase (STAVKA), although it is not an acronym. &quot;Stavka&quot; may refer to its members, as well as to the headquarters location (its original meaning from the old Russian word &quot;ставка&quot;, &#x27;tent&#x27;).

==Stavka of the Supreme Commander during World War I==

The commander-in-chief of the Russian army at the beginning of World War I was Grand Duke Nicholas Nicholaievitch, a grandson of Tsar Nicholas I. Appointed at the last minute in August 1914, he played no part in formulating the military plans in use at the beginning of the war. Nikolai Yanushkevich was his chief of staff. In the summer of 1915 the Tsar himself took personal command, with Mikhail Alekseyev as his chief of staff. In the years 1915–1917 Stavka was based in Mogilev and the Tsar, Nicholas II, spent long periods there as Commander-in-Chief.

The Stavka was divided into several departments:
* Department of General-Quartermaster (Operations department)
* Department of General on Duty (Organisation of troops, supplies, promotions, staff matters)
* Department of military transportations
* Naval department
* Diplomatic chancery (liaison with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs)

The Stavka was first established in Baranovichi. In August 1915, after the German advance, the Stavka re-located to Mogilev.

===Chiefs of staff===

* 19 July 1914 – 18 August 1915: Lieutenant-General (from 22 October 1914, General of Infantry) Nikolai Yanushkevich
* 18 September 1915 – 1 April 1917: General of Infantry (from 1916 adjutant General) Mikhail Alekseyev
* 10 November 1916 – 17 February 1917: General of Cavalry Vasily Gurko
* 11 March 1917 – 5 April 1917: General of Infantry Vladislav Klembovsky 
* 5 April 1917 – 31 May 1917: Lieutenant-General Anton Denikin
* 2 June 1917 – 30 August 1917: Lieutenant-General Alexander Lukomsky
* 30 August 1917 – 9 September 1917: General of Infantry Mikhail Alekseyev
* 10 October 1917 – 3 November 1917: Lieutenant-General Nikolay Dukhonin
* 3 November 1917 – 7 November 1917: Major General Mikhail Dieterichs
* 7 November 1917 – February 1918: Major General Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich

==Stavka of the Red Army during World War II==

The Stavka of the Soviet Armed Forces during World War II, or the headquarters of the &quot;Main Command of the Armed Forces of the USSR&quot; (&quot;Stavka Glavnogo Komandovaniya&quot;) (), was established on 23 June 1941 by a top-secret decree signed by Joseph Stalin in his capacities both as the head of government and as the leader of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. According to this decree, Stavka was composed of the defence minister Marshal Semyon Timoshenko (as its president), the head of General Staff Georgy Zhukov, Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Marshal Kliment Voroshilov, Marshal Semyon Budyonny and the People&#x27;s Commissar (Narkom) of the Navy Admiral Nikolai Gerasimovich Kuznetsov.

The same decree organized at Stavka &quot;the institution of permanent counsellors of Stavka&quot;: Marshal Kulik, Marshal Shaposhnikov, Kirill Meretskov, head of the Air force Zhigarev, Nikolay Vatutin, head of Air Defence Voronov, Mikoyan, Kaganovich, Lavrenty Beria, Voznesensky, Zhdanov, Malenkov, Mekhlis.

Very soon afterwards, the deputy defence minister of the army, Meretskov, was arrested following false charges made by Beria and Merkulov. Meretskov was subsequently released from jail on the same day, at the end of the first week of September 1941, which was called for by Stalin.

Stavka&#x27;s Main Command was reorganized into the Stavka of the Supreme Command (&quot;Stavka Verkhovnogo Komandovaniya&quot;) on 10 July 1941. This action occurred after Stalin was named Supreme Commander, and replaced Timoshenko as head of Stavka. On 8 August 1941 it was again reorganized into Stavka of the Supreme Main Command (&quot;Stavka Verkhovnogo Glavnokomandovaniya&quot;).

On the same day Strategic Directions commands were instituted.

A 17 February 1945 decree set out the membership of Stavka as Stalin (President), Zhukov, Aleksandr Vasilevsky, Aleksei Antonov, Nikolai Bulganin and Kuznetsov.

== Stavka of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine ==

The Stavka of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief () is the highest command and control body for the troops and individual branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as law enforcement services and agencies of Ukraine, which are part of the Armed Forces, formed by decree of the President of Ukraine No. 72/2022 dated February 24, 2022 in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on that day.

<doc id="255102" wikidata="Q526314" url="?curid=255102" title="Lambic">
<text>Lambic ( , ; ) is a type of beer brewed in the Pajottenland region of Belgium southwest of Brussels since the 13th century. Types of lambic beer include gueuze, kriek lambic, and framboise. Lambic differs from most other beers in that it is fermented through exposure to wild yeasts and bacteria native to the Zenne valley, as opposed to exposure to carefully cultivated strains of brewer&#x27;s yeast. This process gives the beer its distinctive flavour: dry, , and cidery, often with a tart aftertaste.

== Etymology ==
This beverage is first mentioned in 1794 as &quot;allambique&quot;. The initial &#x27;a&#x27; was dropped early on so that in an 1811 advertisement it was called &quot;lambicq&quot;, though it was sometimes referred to as &quot;alambic&quot; as late as 1829. The name may stem from alembic, a type of still used for producing local spirits such as cognac and jenever (but not used in the production of lambic). Breweries in and around Lembeek, a village near Halle, Belgium, have attempted to associate lambic with that name, including through the legend of local saint Veronus of Lembeek.

== Brewing ==

Lambic is generally brewed from a grist containing about 60–70% barley malt and 30–40% unmalted wheat. The wort is cooled overnight in a shallow, flat, metal pan (generally copper or stainless steel) called a coolship, where it is left exposed to the open air so more than 120 different types of microorganisms may inoculate the wort. This cooling process requires night-time temperatures between . While this cooling method of open-air exposure is a critical feature of the style, the key yeasts and bacteria that perform the fermentation reside within the breweries&#x27; timber fermenting vessels. Over 80 microorganisms have been identified in lambic beer, the most significant being &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, &quot;Saccharomyces pastorianus&quot;, and &quot;Brettanomyces bruxellensis&quot;. The process is generally only possible between October and May as in the summer, too many unfavourable organisms that are in the air could spoil the beer. In Brussels dialect, lambic produced after this traditional brewing season is referred to as &quot;bezomerd&quot;, meaning that it has had &quot;too much summer&quot;. Climate change is further shortening this limited brewing window; in the early 1900s, lambic brewers enjoyed roughly 165 days a year in the ideal temperature range, whereas by 2018, that number has shrunk to 140.

Since at least the 11th century, and probably earlier, hops have been used in beer for their natural preservative qualities and for the pleasant bitterness, flavour, and aroma they impart. Since the method of inoculation and long fermentation time of lambic beers increases the risk of spoilage, lambic brewers use large amounts of hops for their antibacterial properties. Lambic in the early 19th century was a highly hopped beer, using 8–9 g/L of the locally grown &#x27;Aalst&#x27; or &#x27;Poperinge&#x27; varieties. Modern lambic brewers, however, try to avoid making the beer extremely hop-forward and use aged, dry hops, which have lost much of their bitterness, aroma, and flavour. Consequently, lambics often have a strong, cheese-like, &quot;old hop&quot; aroma, in contrast to the resiny, herbal, earthy hop bitterness found in other styles. The favourite hop used for lambic in the nineteenth century was a variety called Coigneau which was cultivated in the Aalst-Asse area in Belgium.

After the fermentation process starts, the lambic is siphoned into barrels, mostly old port wine or sherry barrels (of chestnut or oak) from Portugal or Spain. Some brewers prefer used wine barrels. The lambic is left to ferment and mature for one or several years. It forms a &quot;velo de flor&quot; of yeast that gives some protection from oxidation, in a similar way to &quot;vin jaune&quot; and sherry; the barrels are not topped up.

== Types of lambic and derived beers ==
Lambic is usually a blend of at least two different beers; many producers are blenders who buy beer from other brewers and blend them together to create the desired result. A gueuze may have occupied space in several different cellars over six years or more. While those outside Belgium are likely to find bottled gueuze and fruited versions, a wider variety of styles is available to local drinkers. Beers are often blended again or sweetened with sugar or flavoured syrups before drinking, as some can be extremely tart. Most, if not all, of the varieties listed below, have Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) status. This status does not specify that a product has a link to a specific geographical area.
=== Unblended lambic ===
Unblended lambic is a cloudy, uncarbonated, bracingly sour beverage that is rarely available on tap. Draught releases are generally regarded as either &quot;jonge&quot; (young) or &quot;oude&quot; (old), depending on the age and discretion of the brewer. Bottled offerings from Cantillon and De Cam can be found outside Belgium.

=== Gueuze ===

A mixture of young (one-year-old) and old (two- and three-year-old) lambics have been bottled. Because the young lambics are not yet fully fermented, they undergo secondary fermentation in the bottle and produce carbon dioxide. A gueuze is given at least a year to carbonate in the bottle, but can be kept for 10–20 years.

=== Mars ===
Mars traditionally referred to a weaker beer made from the second runnings of a lambic brewing. It is no longer commercially produced. In the 1990s, Boon Brewery made a modern Mars beer called Lembeek&#x27;s 2% (the 2% referring to the alcohol content), but it is now only produced for use of Tilquin as a component of their keg beers.

=== Faro ===
Historically, is a low-alcohol, sweetened beer made from a blend of lambic and a much lighter, freshly brewed beer to which brown sugar (or sometimes caramel or molasses) was added. The fresh beer was referred to as &quot;meertsbier&quot;, and was not necessarily a lambic. Sometimes herbs were added as well. The use of &quot;meertsbier&quot; (or water) and of substandard lambic in the blend made this a cheap, light, sweet drink for everyday consumption. The 19th-century French poet Charles Baudelaire commented on faro&#x27;s disagreeable aftertaste in saying, &quot;It&#x27;s beer that you drink twice&quot;, believing that the faro in Brussels was brewed from the waters of a river (the Senne or Zenne) that was also used as a sewer.

The sugar was originally added shortly before serving, so does not add carbonation or alcohol to the beverage, as the sugar did not have the time to ferment. Modern faro beer is still characterized by the use of brown sugar and lambic, but is not always a light beer. The use of&quot; meertsbier&quot; has disappeared, and modern faro is not viewed as cheap or light. Today, faro is bottled, sweetened, and pasteurized to prevent refermentation in the bottle. Examples are produced by Cantillon, Boon, Oud Beersel, Lindemans or Mort Subite.

=== Kriek ===

Lambic refermented in the presence of sour cherries (usually the &quot;morello&quot; variety, or a bitter variety known as the Schaarbeek cherry) and with secondary fermentation in the bottle results in kriek. Traditional versions of kriek are dry and sour, just as with traditional gueuze.

=== Fruit ===

Lambic may be made with the addition of raspberry (framboise), peach (pêche), blackcurrant (cassis), grape (druif), or strawberry (aardbei), as either whole fruit or syrup. Other, rarer fruit lambic flavorings include apple (pomme), banana (banane), pineapple (ananas), apricot (abricot), plum (prune), cloudberry (plaquebière), lemon (citron), and blueberry (myrtille). Fruit lambics are usually bottled with secondary fermentation. Although fruit lambics are among the most famous Belgian fruit beers, the use of names such as kriek, framboise or frambozen, cassis, etc. does not necessarily imply that the beer is made from lambic. The fruit beers produced by the Liefmans Brewery, for example, use an oud bruin, rather than a lambic, as a base.

Many of the non-traditional fruit beers derived from lambic that was commercialized in the last decades are considered to be low-quality products by many beer enthusiasts. These products are typically artificially sweetened, artificially carbonated, sterilized, and based on the juice of the fruit instead of the whole fruit.

== Belgian producers ==

Lambic beers are only produced near Brussels due to that region&#x27;s natural microflora. The number of producers, which numbered more than 300 in 1900, shrank drastically throughout the 20th century. Lambic production is generally sanctioned and promoted by HORAL.

<doc id="255104" wikidata="Q241669" url="?curid=255104" title="Nancy Spungen">
<text>Nancy Laura Spungen (; February 27, 1958 – October 12, 1978) was the American girlfriend of English musician Sid Vicious and a figure of the 1970s punk rock scene.

Born and raised in Philadelphia, Spungen was an emotionally disturbed child who was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 15. After being expelled from college, she moved to New York City and became a stripper. Known for being a groupie, she flew to London in December 1976 at the height of the punk rock movement, where she became involved with Vicious, the bassist for the Sex Pistols. Their relationship was tumultuous, characterized by domestic violence, substance abuse and heroin addiction.

Media labeled Spungen &quot;Nauseating Nancy&quot; for her outrageous and frequently antisocial behavior. After John Lydon left the band and Vicious was made a focal point of subsequent band activities, the couple moved to New York City and checked into the Hotel Chelsea, where they spent much of their time using drugs, especially heroin.

In October 1978, Spungen was found dead in the bathroom of the couple&#x27;s room at the Hotel Chelsea from a single stab wound to her abdomen. Vicious was charged with her second-degree murder but died of a heroin overdose while on bail in February 1979, before the case could be brought to trial. Various authors and filmmakers have speculated about Vicious&#x27; role in Spungen&#x27;s death, and the possibility that she was killed by a drug dealer who frequently visited their room.

==Early life and education==
Spungen was born on February 27, 1958, at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, to Franklin &quot;Frank&quot; (1934–2010) and Deborah Spungen (1937–2024). The Spungens were a middle-class Jewish family that resided in Lower Moreland Township, a Philadelphia suburb. Spungen&#x27;s father was a traveling salesman and her mother later owned an organic food store called The Earth Shop in nearby Jenkintown. Her maternal family originally emigrated to the United States from Zhmerynka, Ukraine, following the pogroms during the Russian Civil War in the 1910s.

At the time of her birth, a newborn Spungen nearly died of oxygen deprivation after being choked by her umbilical cord during delivery; it was determined that she had not suffered any serious, brain-damaging oxygen loss. However, it was then noted that Spungen’s skin was jaundiced and that she showed symptoms of severe cyanosis, forcing the newborn to undergo immediate blood transfusions; her parents were not able to see her or hold her at this point, preventing potential bonding-time. Instead, Spungen was strapped to a small hospital bed and worked on by doctors, who ultimately saved her life. She was released from the hospital eight days after her birth.

Spungen proved to be a difficult baby, throwing crying fits and temper tantrums late into childhood. At three months old, she was prescribed a liquid barbiturate by a pediatrician, something typically given to patients experiencing seizures. The medication was ineffective, and her violent behavior persisted. In 1983, Spungen&#x27;s mother said, &quot;I know it&#x27;s normal for babies to cry, but Nancy did nothing but scream.&quot; Though she excelled academically, she had few friends during her elementary school years.

As a child, Spungen exhibited violent behavior toward her younger sister Susan, but was very caring toward her younger brother David. Susan, who later became a noted author and food stylist, said she had &quot;mixed memories&quot; of her sister: &quot;We were happy as kids and we played together and I looked up to [Nancy]. I was 10 or 11 when she went to boarding school and then she wasn&#x27;t home a lot.&quot; Spungen allegedly threatened to kill a babysitter with scissors and attempted to batter her psychiatrist, who accused her of acting out for attention. At age 11, Spungen was expelled from public school after missing class over two weeks. Weary of her erratic behavior, her parents enrolled her at Devereux Glenholme School in Washington, Connecticut, and Devereux Manor High School in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. In January 1972, Spungen ran away from Devereux Manor and attempted suicide by slitting her wrists with scissors. At age 15, her psychiatrist diagnosed her with schizophrenia.

Spungen graduated from Lakeside High School in 1974, two weeks after she was accepted to the University of Colorado Boulder. She began attending the university at age 16. Five months into her freshman year, she was arrested for attempting to purchase marijuana from an undercover police officer. After being arrested a second time for storing stolen property in her dorm room, CU Boulder expelled her. Spungen&#x27;s father traveled to Boulder and accepted a plea bargain on her behalf, under which she agreed to be banished from the state of Colorado.

==Relationship with Sid Vicious==

Spungen left home at age 17 and moved to New York City, where she supported herself via prostitution, amateur music journalism, and retail jobs at clothing stores. In her free time, she became a groupie and followed rock bands, including Aerosmith, Bad Company, the New York Dolls, and the Ramones.

In December 1976, Spungen flew to London with The Heartbreakers and met the Sex Pistols, which later included bassist Sid Vicious. Vicious and Spungen first met the night she arrived in London. After being rejected by John Lydon, Nancy and Sid started a relationship, moving in together in March 1977.

Over their 19-month relationship from March 1977 to October 1978, Spungen and Vicious developed heroin addictions; Vicious was already abusing multiple drugs prior to meeting Spungen. Tabloids dubbed Spungen &quot;Nauseating Nancy&quot; for her frequent public outbursts.

In January 1978, following the breakup of the Sex Pistols, Spungen and Vicious relocated to New York City, where they lived in Room 100 at the Hotel Chelsea, where they were registered as &quot;Mr. and Mrs. John Simon Ritchie&quot;, Vicious&#x27; real name.

==Death==
On October 12, 1978, Spungen&#x27;s body was found under the wash basin in the bathroom of their room at the Hotel Chelsea. She had suffered a stab wound to the abdomen. Vicious owned the knife that inflicted the injury, a Jaguar Wilderness K-11 with a blade.
Press misreported the murder weapon as a different knife owned by Vicious, a &quot;007&quot; hunting knife.

Vicious shared conflicting stories of the night Spungen died. He was immediately arrested, charged with second-degree murder, and released on $50,000 bail.

Four months after Spungen&#x27;s death, Vicious died of a heroin overdose prior to his trial taking place. The New York City Police Department closed the case after Vicious&#x27; death.

Spungen is buried in the King David Memorial Park, a traditional Jewish cemetery in Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania.

There are various theories about the cause of Spungen&#x27;s death. Some of them do not implicate Vicious in her murder. One such theory is that two drug dealers visited their room that night and conducted a robbery. Certain items, including a substantial amount of money, were claimed to be missing from the room.

In his book &quot;Pretty Vacant: A History of Punk&quot;, Phil Strongman accuses actor and stand-up comic Rockets Redglare of killing Spungen; Redglare delivered drugs to the couple&#x27;s room the night of Spungen&#x27;s death. Throughout his life, Redglare (who died in 2001) steadfastly denied any involvement in the killing to the press, but allegedly confessed to the killing within his circle of friends.

==In popular culture==
*In 1979, &quot;Horror Business&quot;, a 1979 song by the American punk rock band the Misfits, was inspired by Spungen&#x27;s murder. The song&#x27;s lyrics include lines, such as: &quot;You don&#x27;t go in the bathroom with me&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll put a knife right in you.&quot; Prior to Vicious&#x27;s death, the Misfits were rumored to back Vicious on his proposed debut solo album. Misfits bassist Jerry Only attended a dinner gathering at the apartment of Michelle Robinson, Vicious&#x27;s new girlfriend, the night Vicious died.
*In 1983, Spungen&#x27;s mother Deborah wrote a memoir, &quot;And I Don&#x27;t Want to Live This Life&quot;. Its title is taken from a poem Vicious wrote.
*In 1986, the film &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot;, directed by Alex Cox, was released, portraying the life of Vicious, played by Gary Oldman, and his relationship with Spungen, played by Chloe Webb. Critics praised Webb&#x27;s performance as Spungen. In the film, Cox also put forth the theory that Spungen and Vicious had a suicide pact.
*The 2006 anime &quot;Nana&quot; references Sid and Nancy&#x27;s relationship and its punk/rock aesthetics, particularly when it comes to two main characters.
*In 2007, Veronica Schanoes&#x27;s story &quot;Rats&quot; appeared at the 2007 Interstitial Arts Foundation anthology, &quot;Interfictions&quot;. The story is a punk rock fairytale inspired by Spungen&#x27;s life. Schanoes said, &quot;I wrote &#x27;Rats&#x27; because I was angry with the way the recent coffee-table histories of punk seem to have no problem demonizing a dead, mentally ill, teenage girl.&quot;
*In 2010, a documentary film &quot;Who Killed Nancy?&quot;, directed by Alan G. Parker, was released, and includes interviews with Vicious and Spungen&#x27;s associates, including John Holmstrom, Don Letts, Glen Matlock, and Howie Pyro.
*In 2022, &quot;Pistol&quot;, a miniseries, was released, with Vicious portrayed by Louis Partridge. The miniseries depicts Vicious as waking up in a confused state the morning after Spungen&#x27;s death with apparently vague recollections of an altercation the previous night. He is then horrified to find Spungen, played by Emma Appleton, dead in the bathroom. This version appears to accept Vicious&#x27;s account that he had no memory of how Spungen had been injured.

<doc id="255109" wikidata="Q1124857" url="?curid=255109" title="Plymouth (automobile)">
<text>Plymouth was a brand of automobiles produced by Chrysler Corporation and its successor DaimlerChrysler. The brand was launched in 1928 to compete in what was then described as the &quot;low-priced&quot; market segment that was dominated by Chevrolet and Ford. It became a high-volume seller for the automaker until the late 1990s. Plymouth cars were marketed primarily in the United States. The brand was withdrawn from the marketplace in 2001. The Plymouth models that were produced up until then were either discontinued or rebranded as Chrysler or Dodge.

==History==
===Origins===
The Plymouth automobile was introduced at Madison Square Garden on July 7, 1928. It was Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s first entry in the low-priced field previously dominated by Chevrolet and Ford. Plymouths were initially priced higher than the competition, but offered standard features such as internal expanding hydraulic brakes that Ford and Chevrolet did not provide. Plymouths were originally sold exclusively through Chrysler dealerships, offering a low-cost alternative to the upscale Chrysler-brand cars, listing the 4-door 5-passenger Touring Sedan at US$695. The logo featured a prow view of the ship &quot;Mayflower&quot; which landed at Plymouth Rock in Plymouth, Massachusetts. However, the inspiration for the Plymouth brand name came from Plymouth binder twine, produced by the Plymouth Cordage Company, also of Plymouth. The name was chosen by Joe Frazer due to the popularity of the twine among farmers.

The origins of Plymouth can be traced back to the Maxwell automobile. When Walter P. Chrysler took over control of the troubled Maxwell-Chalmers car company in the early 1920s, he inherited the Maxwell as part of the package. After he used the company&#x27;s facilities to help create and launch the six-cylinder Chrysler automobile in 1924, he decided to create a lower-priced companion car, using lessons learned when he was running Buick under William C. Durant at GM. So for 1926, the Maxwell was reworked and rebadged as the low-end four-cylinder Chrysler Model 52. In 1928, the 52 was once again redesigned to create the Chrysler-Plymouth Model Q, although print advertisements called it Plymouth and did not mention engine size or model designation. The &quot;Chrysler&quot; portion of the nameplate was dropped with the introduction of the Plymouth Model U in 1929.

===Great Depression, 1930s–1940s===

While the original purpose of the Plymouth was to serve the lower end of a booming automobile market, during the Great Depression of the 1930s the division helped significantly in ensuring the survival of the Chrysler Corporation when many other car companies failed. Beginning in 1930, Plymouths were sold by all three Chrysler divisions (Chrysler, DeSoto, and Dodge). Plymouth sales were a bright spot during this dismal automotive period, and by 1931 Plymouth rose to number three in sales among all cars. In 1931 with the Model PA, the company introduced floating power and boasted, &quot;The smoothness of an eight – the economy of a four.&quot;

In 1933, Chrysler decided to catch up with Ford, Chevrolet, and Pontiac in engine cylinder count. The version of Chrysler&#x27;s flathead-six engine was equipped with a downdraft carburetor and installed in the new 1933 Plymouth PC, introduced on November 17, 1932. However, Chrysler had reduced the PC&#x27;s wheelbase from , and the car sold poorly. By April 1933, the Dodge division&#x27;s Model DP chassis, with a wheelbase, was put under the PC body with DP front fenders, hood, and radiator shell. The model designation was advanced to &#x27;PD&#x27;. The PC was redesigned to look similar to the PD and became the &#x27;Standard Six&#x27; (PCXX). It had been the &#x27;Plymouth Six&#x27; at the introduction and was sold through to the end of 1933, but in much lower numbers. In 1937, Plymouth (along with the other Chrysler makes) added safety features such as flat dashboards with recessed controls and the back of the front seat padded for the rear seat occupants.

The PC was shipped overseas to Sweden, Denmark, and the UK, as well as Australia. In the UK, it was sold as a &#x27;Chrysler Kew&#x27;, the town of Kew being the location of the Chrysler factory in a district in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. The flathead six which started with the 1933 Model PC stayed in the Plymouth until the 1959 models.

In 1939, Plymouth produced 417,528 vehicles, of which 5,967 were two-door convertible coupes with rumble seats. The 1939 convertible coupe was prominently featured at Chrysler&#x27;s exhibit at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, advertised as the first mass-production convertible with a power-folding top. It featured a , version of the flathead six engine.

For much of its life, Plymouth was one of the top-selling American automobile brands; it, together with Chevrolet and Ford, was commonly referred to as the &quot;low-priced three&quot; marques in the American market. Plymouth almost surpassed Ford in 1940 and 1941 as the second-most popular make of automobiles in the U.S.

===1950s===
In 1954, Plymouth offered an optional torque converter mated to a standard three-speed transmission, marketed as &quot;PowerFlite&quot;. It improved upon the &quot;Hy-Drive&quot; semiautomatic transmission which had been introduced the previous year. On March 25, 1954, Chrysler officially introduced to the public its first attempt at a turbine-powered car. Chrysler installed an experimental turbine, developed specifically for road vehicles, in a Plymouth. The car used was a standard 1954 Belvedere two-door hardtop. This was the beginning of a decades-long but unsuccessful attempt to develop and market a viable car powered by a turbine engine.

1955 saw Plymouth&#x27;s dramatic redesign by Chrysler stylist Virgil Exner. Longer, lower, wider, it was a sensation and sales zoomed up 52% over 1954. In addition to the &quot;Forward Look&quot; styling, the new car got its first modern, overhead-valve V8 displacing . The optional PowerFlite fully automatic transmission had a selector lever on the instrument panel.

In 1956, Plymouth introduced the Fury, a &quot;halo&quot; model in the Belvedere series that featured a high-performance 240-hp V8, and gold-anodized trim on a body available in Eggshell White only and limited to the two-door hardtop. The Fury continued to be a special, high-end car until 1959, when it replaced the Belvedere as the de luxe series, available in hardtop, convertible, and sedan body styles. The 1957 and 1958 Furys were painted in Buckskin Beige, replacing Eggshell White as the only available exterior color. Optional equipment included air conditioning, automatic transmission, power steering, and power-assist brakes. In 1959, a special Sport Fury was available as the &quot;special&quot; sporty Plymouth. The PowerFlite automatic was now controlled by reliable mechanical push buttons on a pod on the left side of the dash.

In 1957, Virgil Exner&#x27;s new Forward Look design theme, advertised by Plymouth with the tagline &quot;Suddenly, it&#x27;s 1960&quot;, produced cars with advanced styling compared to Chevrolet or Ford. The 1957 total production soared to 726,009, about 200,000 more than 1956, and the largest output yet for Plymouth. However, the 1957–1958 Forward Look models suffered from poor materials, spotty build quality, and inadequate corrosion protection; they were rust-prone and greatly damaged Chrysler&#x27;s reputation.

===1960s===
Although Plymouth sales suffered as a result of the quality control problems and excesses of the Exner-styled models in the early 1960s, people bought enough of the cars to keep the division profitable. Starting in 1961, the Valiant compact became a Plymouth, further boosting sales. Under the impression that Chevrolet was about to &quot;downsize&quot; its 1962 models, Chrysler introduced a significantly smaller standard Plymouth for 1962. As is known, Chevrolet&#x27;s big cars were not downsized, catching Plymouth in a sales slump in a market where &quot;bigger was better&quot;. The 1963 Fury, Belvedere, and Savoy were slightly larger, featuring a totally new body style, highlighted by prominent outboard front parking lights. For 1964, Plymouth got another major restyle, featuring a new &quot;slantback&quot; roofline for hardtop coupes that would prove popular.

For 1965, the Plymouth Fury models were built on the new C-body platform. The Savoy line was discontinued and the Belvedere was classified as an intermediate, retaining the B-body platform used starting 1962. The low-end series was Fury I, the mid-level model was Fury II, and the higher-end models were Fury IIIs. The Sport Fury, which featured bucket seats and a console shifter, was a mix of luxury and sport. Ford and Chevrolet had introduced luxury editions of their big cars for 1965 and Plymouth responded with the 1966 Sport Fury with a V8 and the VIP was introduced as a more luxurious version of the Fury. Furys, Belvederes, and Valiants continued to sell well during the late-1960s and early-1970s. While Fury I and Fury II were only available in the U.S. as sedans, Fury II was available as a two-door hardtop in addition to the pillared sedans in Canada.

The performance car market segment expanded during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The 1964 Barracuda fastback is considered the first of Plymouth&#x27;s sporty cars. Based on the Valiant, it was available with the Slant Six, or small block V8. For 1967, Plymouth introduced the Belvedere GTX, a bucket-seat high-style hardtop coupe and convertible that could be ordered with either the &quot;Super Commando&quot; or Hemi V8 engines. Looking for an advantage at the drag races, 1968 had a stripped-down Belvedere coupe, the Road Runner, which featured a bench seat and minimal interior and exterior trim, but was available with Chrysler&#x27;s big-block engines and a floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission. The Barracuda, originally a &quot;compact sporty car&quot;, became available with the 426 Hemi and 440 big-block engines in 1968. The GTX, Barracuda, Road Runner, Sport Fury GT, and Valiant Duster 340, were marketed by Plymouth as the &#x27;Rapid Transit System&#x27;, which was similar to Dodge&#x27;s &#x27;Scat Pack&#x27; concept. During this time, the brand also competed in professional automobile racing. Examples include Richard Petty&#x27;s career with Plymouth in NASCAR; Dan Gurney, who raced a &#x27;Cuda as part of the All American Racers in numerous Trans Am events; and Sox and Martin, one of the most well-known drag-racing teams of the period, only raced Plymouths after 1964.

===1970s===


By the 1970s, emissions and safety regulations, along with soaring gasoline prices and an economic downturn, meant demand dropped for all muscle-type models. As with other American vehicles of the time, there was a progressive decrease in the Barracuda&#x27;s performance. To meet increasingly stringent safety and exhaust emission regulations, big-block engine options were discontinued. The remaining engines were detuned year by year to reduce exhaust emissions, which also reduced their power output. There was also an increase in weight as bumpers became larger and, starting in 1970, E-body doors were equipped with heavy steel side-impact protection beams. Higher fuel prices and performance-car insurance surcharges deterred many buyers as the interest in high-performance cars waned. Sales of pony cars were on the decline. Sales had dropped dramatically after 1970, and while 1973 showed a sales uptick, Barracuda production ended April 1, 1974, ten years to the day after it had begun.
The redesign for the 1970 Barracuda removed all its previous commonality with the Valiant. The original fastback design was deleted from the line and the Barracuda now consisted of coupe and convertible models. The all-new model, styled by John E. Herlitz, was built on a shorter, wider version of Chrysler&#x27;s existing B platform, called the E-body. Sharing this platform was the newly launched Dodge Challenger; however, no exterior sheet metal interchanged between the two cars, and the Challenger, at , had a wheelbase that was longer than the Barracuda.

The E-body Barracuda was now &quot;able to shake the stigma of &#x27;economy car&#x27;.&quot; Three versions were offered for 1970 and 1971: the base Barracuda (BH), the luxury oriented Gran Coupe (BP), and the sport model &#x27;Cuda (BS). Beginning mid-year 1970, and ending with the 1971 model, there also was the Barracuda Coupe (A93), a low-end model that included the Slant Six as a base engine, lower-grade interior, and (like other Coupe series Chrysler Corp. offered that year) had fixed quarter glass instead of roll-down rear passenger windows. The high-performance models were marketed as&quot; &#x27;Cuda&quot; deriving from the 1969 option. The E-body&#x27;s engine bay was larger than that of the previous A-body, facilitating the release of Chrysler&#x27;s Hemi for the regular retail market.

For 1970 and 1971, the Barracuda and Barracuda Gran Coupe had two six-cylinder engines available — a new version of the slant-6, and the 225 — as well as three different V8s: a , as well as a with a two-barrel carburetor and single exhaust and with a four-barrel carburetor and dual exhaust producing SAE gross. The Cuda had the 383ci SAE gross (same as Dodge&#x27;s 383 Magnum) as the standard engine. Optional were the with four-barrel carburetor &quot;Super Commando&quot; or the six-barrel &quot;Super Commando Six Pak&quot; as well as the Hemi. The 440- and Hemi-equipped cars received upgraded suspension components and structural reinforcements to help transfer the power to the road.

In 1970, the power plant options offered to the customer were:
#275 hp (200 kW) SAE gross in the 340-4V.
# SAE gross in the high performance 383-4V,
# SAE gross in the 440-4V, 
# SAE gross in the 440-6V, and
# SAE gross in the 426-8V.
Other Barracuda options included decal sets, hood modifications, and unusual &quot;high impact&quot; colors.

The compact Valiant sold well and built a reputation for attractive styling, durability, economy, and value. Although the Valiant hardtop was discontinued for 1967, it was reintroduced as a virtual clone of the Dodge Dart Swinger for 1971 under the model name &quot;Valiant Scamp&quot;. The Scamp was produced along with the Valiant, Dodge Dart, and Swinger until 1976, when it was replaced with the Volaré. Featuring transverse-mounted torsion bars and a slightly larger body, the Volaré (and its Dodge twin, the Aspen) was an instant sales success. Available as coupe, sedan, or station wagon, the Volaré offered a smoother ride and better handling than the Dart/Valiant, but suffered quality control problems and by 1980, was selling poorly.

Realizing that front-wheel drive, four-cylinder engines, and rack-and-pinion steering would become the standards for the 1980s, Chrysler introduced a new compact car for 1978, the Plymouth Horizon/Dodge Omni twins, based on a Simca platform. Horizon sold well, but suffered from a scathing report by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;, which found its handling dangerous in certain situations. Plymouth continued to sell the Horizon until 1987, when a variety of front-wheel drive compact cars made up the line. Big Plymouths, including the Fury and Gran Fury, were sold until the early 1980s, but mostly as fleet vehicles. While attempting to compete with Ford and Chevrolet for big-car sales, Plymouth was hurt by Chrysler&#x27;s financial woes in the late 1970s, when both its competitors downsized their full-size models.

===1980s===

Most Plymouth models, especially those offered from the 1970s onward, such as the Valiant, Volaré, and the Acclaim, were badge-engineered versions of Dodge or Mitsubishi models.

The Plymouth Reliant and Dodge Aries were introduced for the 1981 model year as the first &quot;K-cars&quot; manufactured and marketed by the Chrysler Corporation. The Reliant was available as a 2-door coupe, 4-door sedan, or as a 4-door station wagon, in three different trim lines: base, Custom, and SE (&quot;Special Edition&quot;). Station wagons came only in Custom or SE trim. Unlike many small cars, the K-cars retained the traditional 6-passenger 2-bench seat with a column shifter seating arrangement favored by many Americans. The Reliant was powered by a then-new 2.2 L I4 SOHC engine, with a Mitsubishi &quot;Silent Shaft&quot; 2.6 L as an option (curiously this engine also featured hemispherical combustion chambers, and all 1981 models equipped with it featured &quot;HEMI&quot; badges on the front fenders). Initial sales were brisk, with both Reliant and Aries each selling over 150,000 units in 1981. As rebadged variants, the Reliant and Aries were manufactured in Newark, Delaware, Detroit, Michigan, and Toluca, Mexico — in a single generation. After their introduction, the Reliant and Aries were marketed as the &quot;Reliant K&quot; and &quot;Aries K&quot;.

The Reliant replaced the Plymouth Volaré/Road Runner. The Aries replaced the Dodge Aspen. The Reliant and Aries were classified by the EPA as mid-size and were the smallest cars to have 6-passenger seating with a 3-seat per row setup, similar to larger rear-wheel drive cars such as the Dodge Dart and other front-wheel drive cars such as the Chevrolet Celebrity. Chrysler marketed the car as being able to seat &quot;six Americans.&quot; The Aries was sold as the Dart in Mexico. The Reliant and Aries were selected together as &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year for 1981 and sold almost a million Aries and 1.1 million Reliant units over the nine-year run.

In 1982, Plymouth downsized the Gran Fury again, this time sharing the mid-size M platform with the Chrysler Fifth Avenue (called Chrysler New Yorker/New Yorker Fifth Avenue for 1982 and 1983) and the Dodge Diplomat. In addition to the R-body Gran Fury, the M-body Gran Fury replaced the M-body Chrysler LeBaron, which had moved to the compact K platform that year. Now considered a mid-sized car, this generation Gran Fury was close to the exterior size of what was once the compact Valiant and Volaré but offered more interior room. The M-body was in fact heavily based on the Volaré&#x27;s F platform. Like its predecessor, the 1982 Gran Fury was introduced later than its Chrysler and Dodge siblings; the Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Diplomat had used the M-body since 1977. 1982-1989 Plymouth Gran Furys shared the Dodge Diplomat&#x27;s front and rear fascias. They were virtually identical with the exception of badging. Once again, the third generation Gran Fury was available in base and higher-end &quot;Salon&quot; trim. As in previous years, the higher-volume Gran Fury base model catered more towards fleet customers while Gran Fury Salons were geared more towards private customers and offered options such as full vinyl roofs, velour upholstery, turbine-spoke wheels, power windows, and power locks. Although available to private retail customers, the M-body Gran Fury was far more popular with police departments and other fleet customers, primarily since the car was reasonably priced and had a conventional drivetrain with proven components that could withstand a good deal of abuse. This generation of the Gran Fury sold in respectable numbers. However, despite having the same base prices as the Gran Fury (just under $12,000 USD for their final year), the Diplomat always outsold it, usually by several thousand units each year. The Chrysler Fifth Avenue&#x27;s total sales were always more than that of the Gran Fury and Diplomat by far, even though it generally cost about $6,000 more. This was the last car to carry the Gran Fury nameplate, but it remained largely unchanged for its 7-year run. Declining sales, a lack of promotion, and technical obsolescence—the platform dated back to the 1976 Plymouth Volare and Dodge Aspen—eventually contributed to the model&#x27;s demise in early 1989. That year, a driver-side airbag became standard; this would be the last RWD Plymouth until the introduction of the Prowler. While Dodge offered the 1990 Monaco, and later the 1993 Intrepid, Chrysler never replaced the Gran Fury with any other large car in the remainder of Plymouth&#x27;s lineup on through to its demise in the 2001 model year.

In 1984, Chrysler marketed the rebadged Plymouth variant of its new minivan as the Voyager, using the Chrysler&#x27;s S platform, derived from the K-platform (Plymouth Reliant and Dodge Aries). The Voyager shared components with the K-cars including portions of the interior, e.g., the Reliant&#x27;s instrument cluster and dashboard controls, along with the K-platform front-wheel drive layout and low floor, giving the Voyager a car-like ease of entry. The Voyager was on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 1985.

For 1987, the Voyager received minor cosmetic updates as well as the May 1987 introduction of the Grand Voyager, which was built on a longer wheelbase adding more cargo room. It was available only with &quot;SE&quot; or &quot;LE&quot; trim. First-generation Voyager minivans were offered in three trim levels: an unnamed base model, mid-grade &quot;SE&quot;, and high-end &quot;LE&quot;, the latter bearing simulated woodgrain paneling. A sportier &quot;LX&quot; model was added in 1989, sharing much of its components with the Caravan ES. Safety features included 3-point seat belts for the front two passengers and lap belts for the rear passengers. Standard on all Voyagers were legally mandated side-impact reinforcements for all seating front and rear outboard positions, but airbags or ABS were not available. Notably, the Voyager, along with the Dodge Caravan, are considered to be the first mass-produced vehicles to have dedicated built-in cup holders. Original commercials for the 1984 Voyager featured magician Doug Henning as a spokesperson to promote the Voyager &quot;Magic Wagon&#x27;s&quot; versatility, cargo space, low step-in height, passenger volume, and maneuverability. Later commercials in 1989 featured rock singer Tina Turner. Canadian commercials in 1990 featured pop singer Celine Dion.

For 1987, which was the Sundance&#x27;s first year, it was available in a single base model. For 1988, a higher-end RS model was available. The RS model, which stood for Rally Sport, came with standard features that included two-tone paint, fog lights, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. It was also available with a turbocharged 2.2 L I4 engine, and other amenities like an Infinity sound system, tinted window glass, and dual power mirrors. For 1991, the base model split into two distinct models: entry-level America and mid-level Highline, in addition to the high-end RS. The stripped-down America had previously been offered for the Plymouth Horizon&#x27;s final year in 1990.

The AA-body cars were badge-engineered triplets, as were most Chrysler products of this time. The Acclaim differed from its siblings primarily in wheel choices, bodyside molding, and fascias where it sported its unique taillights and the corporate Plymouth eggcrate-grille. Like the K-body and E-body vehicles they replaced, the Acclaim and Dodge Spirit were both marketed as mainstream variants, while the Chrysler LeBaron was marketed as the luxury variant. Despite this, there was substantial overlap in trims and equipment among each car. For example, a fully loaded Acclaim was almost similar to a base LeBaron in features and price.

In addition to its entry-level base model, the Acclaim was initially available in mid-range LE and high-end LX trim. The LE and LX models came equipped with features such as premium cloth seating, power windows/door locks, premium sound systems, bodyside cladding, additional exterior brightwork, and on the latter 15-inch lace-spoke aluminum wheels. In spite of this, the base model accounted for nearly 85 percent of Acclaim sales. Unlike the Spirit, the Acclaim did not receive any sport-oriented models. The Acclaim has also been characterized as the replacement for the smaller Reliant, though the Sundance launched in 1987 is closer than the Acclaim in most dimensions to the Reliant.

===Final years: 1990s–2001===

By the 1990s, Plymouth had lost much of its identity, as its models continued to overlap in features and prices with its sister brands, Dodge and Eagle. Chrysler attempted to remedy this by repositioning Plymouth to its traditional target market as the automaker&#x27;s entry-level brand. This included giving Plymouth its own new sailboat logo and advertisements that focused solely on value. However, this only further narrowed Plymouth&#x27;s product offerings and buyer appeal, and sales continued to fall.

Chrysler considered giving Plymouth a variant of the highly successful new-for-1993 full-size LH platform, which would have been called the Accolade, but decided against it. By the late 1990s, only four vehicles were sold under the Plymouth name: the Voyager/Grand Voyager minivans, the Breeze mid-size sedan, the Neon compact car, and the Prowler sports car, which was to be the last model unique to Plymouth, though the Chrysler PT Cruiser was conceived as a concept unique to Plymouth before production commenced as a Chrysler model.
After discontinuing the Eagle brand in 1998, Chrysler was planning to expand the Plymouth line with a number of unique models before the corporation&#x27;s merger with Daimler-Benz AG. The first model was the Plymouth Prowler, a hot rod-styled sports car. The PT Cruiser was to have been the second. Both models had similar front-end styling, suggesting Chrysler intended a retro styling theme for the Plymouth brand. At the time of Daimler&#x27;s takeover of Chrysler, Plymouth had no models besides the Prowler not also offered in a similar version by Dodge.

From a peak production of 973,000 for the 1973 model year, Plymouth rarely exceeded 200,000 cars per year after 1990. Even the Voyager sales were usually less than 50% of that of the Dodge Caravan. In Canada, the Plymouth name was defunct at the end of the 1999 model year. Consequently, DaimlerChrysler decided to drop the make after a limited run of 2001 models. This was announced on November 3, 1999.

The last new model sold under the Plymouth marque was the second-generation Neon for 2000. The PT Cruiser was ultimately launched as a Chrysler, and the Prowler and Voyager were absorbed into that make, as well. Following the 2001 model year, the Neon was sold only as a Dodge in the US, though it remained available as a Chrysler in Canadian and other markets. The Plymouth Breeze was dropped after 2000, before Chrysler introduced their redesigned 2001 Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Sebring sedan.

*1991: The second generation of the Voyager/Grand Voyager is introduced.
* 1992: The higher-priced Acclaim models were repositioned as entry trim Chrysler LeBarons. Total sales of Acclaim and LeBaron dropped. Total 1993 Plymouth model-year production dropped to 159,775, along with 237,875 Voyager models. Dodge built 300,666 Caravans alone, and 263,539 non-Caravan models.
* 1994: The little-advertised Laser and the popular Sundance and Colt compacts all end production. They are replaced by a single car, the Neon, a car that Chrysler decided to offer as a Plymouth after dealers protested the loss of the Sundance and Colt with no replacement.
* 1995: Plymouth&#x27;s lineup was at its all-time low, with just three cars: the Acclaim, the Neon, and the Voyager/Grand Voyager. The number went up to four in 1997, with the introduction of the Prowler, but never got any higher.
* 1996: Chrysler announced the new Plymouth Breeze six months after sister Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Cirrus models. Chrysler originally had no plans to replace the Acclaim model. In an attempt to move Plymouth downmarket, Chrysler made the redesigned Voyager only available in base and mid-level &quot;SE&quot; models. All of the higher-end trim levels available on the previous generation were now only found on the Dodge Caravan. The high-end trim levels could still be found in certain markets outside the US.
* 1997: Production for the 1997 model year was 178,807 cars plus 187,347 Voyager models. Dodge built 448,394 cars and 355,400 Caravans.
* 1999: Total 1999 production for Plymouth cars was 195,714 with Dodge at 394,052. Voyager production numbered 197,020, compared to 354,641 Caravans. The redesigned 2000 Neon became the brand&#x27;s last new model.
* 2000: The mid-sized Breeze ended production. This was also the last year for the Voyager minivan as a Plymouth. All 2000 Voyagers built in December 1999 and beyond were badged as Chrysler Voyagers. In Canada, the redesigned Neon was sold under the Chrysler name and both the Plymouth and Dodge names were dropped on all car models, save for the Prowler and Viper. The Voyager name was dropped in Canada as all Chrysler dealers sold Dodge trucks, including the Caravan. Total 2000 model year production for Plymouth was 108,546 compared to 459,988 Dodge cars. Voyager production totaled 123,869 versus 330,370 Caravan models.
* 2001: In Plymouth&#x27;s final model year, only the Neon remained. The Prowler and the Voyager became Chryslers. The Voyager gained a high-end LX trim, as well as a base eC trim, and it retained the SE trim. The Breeze was dropped as Chrysler issued the Chrysler Sebring sedan to replace the Chrysler Cirrus. The PT Cruiser was launched as a Chrysler, though it was originally planned to be a Plymouth. The final Plymouth, a Neon, was assembled on June 28, 2001, at the Belvidere Assembly Plant, with a total of 38,657 built for the model year.

<doc id="255114" wikidata="Q1097227" url="?curid=255114" title="2 + 2 = 5">
<text>2 + 2 = 5 or two plus two equals five is a mathematical falsehood which is used as an example of a simple logical error that is obvious to anyone familiar with basic arithmetic.

The phrase has been used in various contexts since 1728, and is best known from the 1949 dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; by George Orwell.

As a theme and as a subject in the arts, the anti-intellectual slogan 2 + 2 = 5 pre-dates Orwell and has produced literature, such as &quot;Deux et deux font cinq&quot; (&quot;Two and Two Make Five&quot;), written in 1895 by Alphonse Allais, which is a collection of absurdist short stories; and the 1920 imagist art manifesto &quot;2 × 2 = 5&quot; by the poet Vadim Shershenevich.

== Self-evident truth and self-evident falsehood ==
In establishing the mundane reality of the self-evident truth of 2 + 2 = 4, in &quot;De Neutralibus et Mediis Libellus&quot; (1652) Johann Wigand said: &quot;That twice two are four; a man may not lawfully make a doubt of it, because that manner of knowledge is grauen [graven] into mannes [man&#x27;s] nature.&quot;

In the comedy-of-manners play &quot;Dom Juan, or The Feast with the Statue&quot; (1665), by Molière, the libertine protagonist, Dom Juan, is asked in what values he believes, and answers that he believes &quot;two plus two equals four&quot;.

In the 18th century, the self-evident falsehood of 2 + 2 = 5 was attested in the &quot;Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences&quot; (1728), by Ephraim Chambers: &quot;Thus, a Proposition would be &quot;absurd&quot;, that should affirm, that two and two make five; or that should deny &#x27;em to make four.&quot; In 1779, Samuel Johnson likewise said that &quot;You may have a reason why two and two should make five, but they will still make but four.&quot;

In the 19th century, in a personal letter to his future wife, Anabella Milbanke, Lord Byron said: &quot;I know that two and two make four—&amp; should be glad to prove it, too, if I could—though I must say if, by any sort of process, I could convert 2 &amp; 2 into &quot;five&quot;, it would give me much greater pleasure.&quot;

In Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Princess Ida&quot; (1884), the Princess comments that &quot;The narrow-minded pedant still believes/That two and two make four! Why, we can prove,/We women—household drudges as we are –/That two and two make five—or three—or seven;/Or five-and-twenty, if the case demands!&quot;

== Politics, literature, propaganda ==
=== France ===

In the late 18th century, in the pamphlet &quot;What is the Third Estate?&quot; (1789), about the legalistic denial of political rights to the common-folk majority of France, Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès, said: &quot;Consequently, if it be claimed that, under the French constitution, 200,000 individuals, out of 26 million citizens, constitute two-thirds of the common will, only one comment is possible: It is a claim that two and two make five.&quot;

Using the illogic of &quot;two and two make five&quot;, Sieyès mocked the demagoguery of the Estates-General for assigning disproportionate voting power to the political minorities of France—the Clergy (First Estate) and the French nobility (Second Estate)—in relation to the Third Estate, the numeric and political majority of the citizens of France.

In the 19th century, in the novel &quot;Séraphîta&quot; (1834), about the nature of androgyny, Honoré de Balzac said:
In the pamphlet &quot;Napoléon le Petit&quot; (1852), about the limitations of the Second French Empire (1852–1870), such as majority political support for the monarchist &quot;coup d&#x27;Ḗtat&quot;, which installed Napoleon III (r. 1852–1870), and the French peoples&#x27; discarding from national politics the liberal values that informed the anti-monarchist Revolution, Victor Hugo said: &quot;Now, get seven million, five hundred thousand votes to declare that two-and-two-make-five, that the straight line is the longest road, that the whole is less than its part; get it declared by eight millions, by ten millions, by a hundred millions of votes, you will not have advanced a step.&quot;

In &quot;The Plague&quot; (1947), French philosopher Albert Camus declared that times came in history when those who dared to say that 2 + 2 = 4 rather than 2 + 2 = 5 were put to death.

=== Russia ===

In the late 19th century, the Russian press used the phrase 2 + 2 = 5 to describe the moral confusion of social decline at the turn of a century, because political violence characterised much of the ideological conflict among proponents of humanist democracy and defenders of tsarist autocracy in Russia. In &quot;The Reaction in Germany&quot; (1842), Mikhail Bakunin said that the political compromises of the French Positivists, at the start of the July Revolution (1830), confirmed their middle-of-the-road mediocrity: &quot;The Left says, 2 times 2 are 4; the Right, 2 times 2 are 6; and the Juste-milieu says, 2 times 2 are 5&quot;.

In &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; (1864), by Feodor Dostoevsky, the anonymous protagonist accepts the falsehood of &quot;two plus two equals five&quot;, and considers the implications (ontological and epistemological) of rejecting the truth of &quot;two times two makes four&quot;, and proposed that the intellectualism of free will—Man&#x27;s inherent capability to choose or to reject logic and illogic—is the cognitive ability that makes humanity human: &quot;I admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing, but, if we are to give everything its due, twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing, too.&quot;

In the literary vignette &quot;Prayer&quot; (1881), Ivan Turgenev said that: &quot;Whatever a man prays for, he prays for a miracle. Every prayer reduces itself to this: &#x27;Great God, grant that twice two be not four&#x27;.&quot; In &quot;God and the State&quot; (1882), Bakunin dismissed deism: &quot;Imagine a philosophical vinegar sauce of the most opposed systems, a mixture of Fathers of the Church, scholastic philosophers, Descartes and Pascal, Kant and Scottish psychologists, all this a superstructure on the divine and innate ideas of Plato, and covered up with a layer of Hegelian immanence, accompanied, of course, by an ignorance, as contemptuous as it is complete, of natural science, and proving, just as two times two make five, the existence of a personal god.&quot; Moreover, the slogan &quot;two plus two equals five&quot;, is the title of the collection of absurdist short stories &quot;Deux et deux font cinq&quot; (&quot;Two and Two Make Five&quot;, 1895), by Alphonse Allais; and the title of the imagist art manifesto &quot;2 x 2 = 5&quot; (1920), by the poet Vadim Shershenevich.

In 1931, the artist supported Stalin&#x27;s shortened production schedule for the economy of the Soviet Union with a propaganda poster that announced the &quot;Arithmetic of an Alternative Plan: 2 + 2 plus the Enthusiasm of the Workers = 5&quot; after Stalin&#x27;s announcement, in 1930, that the first five-year plan (1928–1933) instead would be completed in 1932, in four years&#x27; time.

== George Orwell ==

In Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, it appears as a possible statement of Ingsoc (English Socialism). The Party (i.e. a political party) slogan &quot;War Is Peace, Freedom Is Slavery, Ignorance Is Strength&quot;, is a dogma which the Party expects the citizens of Oceania to believe is true. In writing his secret diary in the year 1984, the protagonist Winston Smith ponders if the Inner Party might declare that &quot;two plus two equals five&quot; is a fact. Smith further ponders whether or not belief in such a consensus reality makes the lie true. About the falsity of &quot;two plus two equals five&quot;, in the Ministry of Love, the interrogator O&#x27;Brien tells the thought criminal Smith that control over physical reality is unimportant to the Party, provided the citizens of Oceania subordinate their real-world perceptions to the political will of the Party; and that, by way of doublethink: &quot;Sometimes, Winston. [Sometimes it is four fingers.] Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once&quot;.

George Orwell used the idea of 2 + 2 = 5 in an essay of January 1939 in &quot;The Adelphi&quot;; &quot;Review of &quot;Power: A New Social Analysis&quot; by Bertrand Russell&quot;:

In propaganda work for the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) during the Second World War (1939–1945), Orwell applied the illogic of 2 + 2 = 5 to counter the reality-denying psychology of Nazi propaganda, which he addressed in the essay &quot;Looking Back on the Spanish War&quot; (1943), indicating that:

In addressing Nazi anti-intellectualism, Orwell&#x27;s reference might have been Hermann Göring&#x27;s hyperbolic praise of Adolf Hitler: &quot;If the Führer wants it, two and two makes five!&quot; In the political novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949), concerning the Party&#x27;s philosophy of government for Oceania, Orwell said:

The 1951 British edition of the text, published by Secker &amp; Warburg, erroneously omitted the &quot;5&quot; in the equation, thus rendering it simply as &quot;2 + 2 =&quot;. This error, likely the result of a typesetting mistake, remained in all further editions of the text until the 1987 edition, whereafter a correction was made based on Orwell&#x27;s original typescript. This misprint did not exist in the American editions of the text, with British students of the text in the meanwhile misinterpreting Orwell&#x27;s original intentions.

== Contemporary usage ==

=== Politics and religion ===

In &quot;The Cult of the Amateur: How Today&#x27;s Internet is Killing Our Culture&quot; (2007), the media critic Andrew Keen uses the slogan &quot;two plus two equals five&quot; to criticise the Wikipedia policy allowing any user to edit the encyclopedia — that the enthusiasm of the amateur for user generated content, peer production, and Web 2.0 technology leads to an encyclopedia of common knowledge, and not an encyclopedia of expert knowledge; that the &quot;wisdom of the crowd&quot; will distort what society considers to be the truth.

In 2020, a social media debate followed biostatistics PhD student Kareem Carr&#x27;s statement, &quot;If someone says 2+2=5, the correct response is, &#x27;What are your definitions and axioms?&#x27; not a rant about the decline of Western civilization&quot;.

<text>Alan Stanley Jones (born 2 November 1946) is an Australian former racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One between and . Jones won the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Williams, and won 12 Grands Prix across 10 seasons.

He was the first driver to win a Formula One World Championship with the Williams team, becoming the 1980 World Drivers&#x27; Champion and the second Australian to do so following triple World Champion Sir Jack Brabham. He competed in a total of 117 Grands Prix, winning 12 and achieving 24 podium finishes. Jones also won the 1978 Can-Am championship driving a Lola.

Jones is also the last Australian driver to win the Australian Grand Prix, winning the 1980 event at Calder Park Raceway, having lapped the field consisting mostly of Formula 5000 cars while he was driving his Formula One Championship winning Williams FW07B.

==Early life and career==

Alan Stanley Jones was born on 2 November 1946 in Melbourne, Victoria.
Jones attended Xavier College and is the son of Stan Jones, an Australian racing driver and winner of the 1959 Australian Grand Prix, and wanted to follow in his footsteps. Jones initially worked in his father&#x27;s Holden dealership while racing a Mini and a Cooper. The younger Jones left for Europe in 1967, to make a name for himself, but found that he could not afford even a Formula Ford drive. He therefore returned home but was back in the UK in 1970 and set about building his career in company with compatriot Brian McGuire.
The two men bought and sold second-hand cars and Jones was eventually able to afford a Formula Three, Lotus 41 which he intended to adapt to Formula Two specification and take back to Australia to sell, in order to finance a season of Formula Three. However, the machine was written off in a testing accident at Brands Hatch in which Jones suffered a broken leg.

In late 1970, Jones signed with a firm for whom McGuire was working, designed to promote drivers&#x27; interests and was selected to compete in a series of races in Brazil. However, in his first two races the engine failed and in the third the gearbox broke, which meant the opportunity ended.

For 1971, Jones campaigned a Brabham BT 28 converted to BT35 specification, in Formula Three and had a moderately successful season which led to a series of tests for March at Silverstone. However, despite the success of the test, Jones was not offered a drive by March and for 1972, drove a GRD in Formula Three. Jones did enough that season to be kept on by GRD for the next year with a new sponsor and only lost the 1973 championship due to a misfiring engine in the last round at Brands Hatch. In 1974, Jones began the season in Formula Atlantic but felt it was a very amateurish effort, but a chance meeting with Harry Stiller led to a drive in the latter&#x27;s March 74. At the end of the season, Jones made his F5000 debut for Stiller in the final round of the European Championship at Brands Hatch in a Chevron B24/28 owned by John MacDonald. It was planned to enter Formula 5000 for 1975. However, Stiller&#x27;s initial plans fell through but after some delay, during which Jones was effectively unemployed, Stiller arranged to purchase a Formula One Hesketh 308 and signed Jones to drive the car.

==Formula One==

===1975–1977: Hesketh, Hill, Surtees and Shadow===

His first race was the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix at the fast Montjuïc circuit in the purchased Hesketh although the weekend turned out to be one of the most tragic in Formula One history 
when Rolf Stommelen&#x27;s crash caused the death of five spectators. After four races in Formula One the team ceased racing after Stiller moved abroad. However, Jones was named as a replacement for the injured Stommelen in Graham Hill&#x27;s team. His best finish with Hill, in four races for the team, was fifth at the Nürburgring.
He earned his first full-time Formula One drive in 1976, in John Surtees&#x27; team. Jones&#x27; car was known for its infamous Durex sponsorship which led the BBC refusing to cover Formula One races during the season. He managed several good finishes in the TS19, a fourth in Japan in the final race of the season being the best of them. Jones refused to drive for Surtees in 1977, preferring to sit out a season than continue with the team.

Jones was racing in America when he was signed by the Shadow team as a replacement for Tom Pryce, who had been killed in a freak racing accident in South Africa. He made the most of the opportunity and won at the Österreichring for his maiden victory, finishing seventh in the championship, with 22 points.

===1978–1981: Williams===
By late 1977, he had caught the attention of Frank Williams as well as Enzo Ferrari. Ferrari had a meeting with him at Maranello, but in the end, Gilles Villeneuve got the drive. Williams, who was looking to rebuild his Formula One racing team. Williams Grand Prix had struggled for success in its first years and after Williams had restarted his team in 1977, Jones was entrusted to give them their first taste of it. As well as Williams, he also signed with Haas-Hall for 1978, and competed in a Lola 333CS in the Can-Am series, winning the title. Jones took nine poles in ten races but missed the Laguna Seca race due to a Formula One scheduling conflict. Stand-in Brian Redman finished twelfth in that race after the kill wire was crimped under a valve cover, resulting in intermittent ignition. Of the nine races in which he competed, Jones won five (Atlanta, Mosport, Road America, Mid-Ohio, and Riverside.) He finished second to Elliot Forbes-Robinson at Charlotte after hitting a chicane and losing a spark plug wire, retired through accident at St Jovite and lost a radiator at Watkins Glen. He finished third at Trois-Rivières after losing a shift fork and being stuck with only second and fifth gears on the tight road circuit. At that race, water-injected brakes were first used in Can-Am, developed by the Haas team and copied with varying degrees of success by others. Jones ran one Can-Am race in 1979 (Mid-Ohio), where he and Keke Rosberg finished 1–2, with Jones winning his last Can-Am start. For Williams, his best result that season was a second-place finish at Watkins Glen. Jones helped put the team on the Formula One map in 1979 using the Williams FW07, after winning four races in the span of five events near the end of the season. Jones finished third in the championship that year, and it was the springboard to an excellent 1980 campaign. Jones&#x27;s best years in Formula One had just begun, in the middle of the ground-effect era.

Jones won seven races in 1980, although the Spanish Grand Prix was later removed from the championship and the Australian Grand Prix was a non-championship race, so only five counted towards the Championship. Throughout the season he had a car which consistently made the podium, and he achieved ten during the year. At the end of the season he had beaten Nelson Piquet by 13 points in the standings, becoming Australia&#x27;s first World Champion since Sir Jack Brabham. He had a good chance to repeat his success in 1981, but a very combative relationship with Carlos Reutemann led to an intense rivalry that possibly cost both drivers a chance at the championship. He finished four points behind Piquet for the championship and three behind Reutemann.

After winning the championship in 1980, Jones and Williams competed in the then non-championship Australian Grand Prix at Calder Park in November. Driving his FW07B against a field consisting mostly of Formula 5000&#x27;s (and Bruno Giacomelli&#x27;s Alfa Romeo 179), Jones, who had previously finished 4th in the race in 1977 (he was penalised 60 seconds for a jumped start, and officially finished just 20 seconds behind winner Warwick Brown showing that if not for the penalty he would have won by 40 seconds), joined his father Stan as a winner of the Australian Grand Prix.

From 1979 to 1981, Jones was awarded the No.1 driver of the season by the editor of the AUTOCOURSE annual. During his championship year in 1980, the AUTOCOURSE editor awarded Jones the No.1 slot not just because he was World Champion but because in the editor&#x27;s opinion &quot;Jones extracted every ounce of potential from the Williams FW07 -and more importantly, he did it consistently. All season Jones never gave anything less than his best.&quot; In 1981 despite missing the championship, the AUTOCOURSE editor still gave the No.1 driver award to Jones because &quot;in 1981 Alan Jones was outstanding, his racing instincts sharper than ever, his driving aggressive and confident.&quot;

===Later Formula One career: 1982–1986===
Jones announced his retirement after the 1981 season, which he managed to cap with a win in Las Vegas, but came out of retirement for a one-time drive with Arrows in at the United States Grand Prix West at Long Beach where he qualified 12th but retired after 58 laps through driver fatigue. A week later he again drove for Arrows in the non-championship Race of Champions at Brands Hatch where he qualified and finished third behind reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg (Williams) and rookie American driver Danny Sullivan (Tyrrell). This was to be his last drive for the team, a bid to raise enough money to drive in the French Grand Prix the week after the Race of Champions failed which saw Arrows use its regular drivers Marc Surer and Chico Serra (whom Jones had replaced at Long Beach) instead.

During a 2012 Grand Prix Legends interview, Jones revealed that he had been contacted by Ferrari to drive for the team from mid-1982 after the death of Gilles Villeneuve and the injury forced retirement of Didier Pironi. As he was enjoying life back in Australia at the time, Jones did not give them an answer straight away and basically gave them the run around, a move he regrets as it was possible that, as the 1980 World Champion, Ferrari would have wanted to keep him for 1983 when he was looking to make a comeback, which would have seen him drive the car which won the Constructors&#x27; Championship in 1983. After taking too long to give them an answer, the Scuderia instead offered the drive to World Champion Mario Andretti who drove the last two races of the 1982 season at Monza and Caesars Palace.

Jones did not compete in Formula One during , though he did drive some World Sportscar Championship races in 1983 and 1984. He made a full-time comeback to F1 late in when Team Haas was created and Jones became the first driver for the team. The American owned and sponsored team was based in England and made its debut at the 1985 Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Jones qualified the new Lola THL1 9.851 seconds slower than pole man Ayrton Senna in his Lotus-Renault and retired after only 6 laps with a blown engine. Jones was joined at Haas in by former Ferrari and Renault works driver Patrick Tambay. The comeback was unsuccessful more due to the Ford V6 engine&#x27;s lack of power compared to its rivals from Honda, TAG-Porsche, BMW, Ferrari and Renault, than any lack of effort from the team and its drivers.

At the end of the 1986 season after the Haas team lost its sponsorship and ran out of money, Jones retired from Formula One for good having won 12 races, 6 pole positions and one World Championship.

==Post Formula One career==

===Sports and touring car racing===

Jones&#x27; post Formula One career was initially spasmodic in nature. Briefly in demand for his services as a touring car co-driver, he raced occasionally in his home country&#x27;s biggest endurance race, the Bathurst 1000 but success was elusive. In 1982 he attempted his first full season of racing, driving a Porsche 935 to dominate the 1982 Australian GT Championship. This championship included races against local touring car ace Peter Brock driving Bob Jane&#x27;s 6.0 litre Chevrolet Monza. The duels between Australia&#x27;s two biggest motorsport names at the time have often been regarded as some of the best racing seen domestically in Australia. Soon after he made his first failed comeback to Formula One. During 1982 he formed his own touring car team, combining the resources of V8 Ford Falcon driver Bob Morris and rotary Mazda RX-7 racer Barry Jones into a single two-car team but results were mixed and the exercise dissipated by the end of the season, though Jones and Jones did win the CRC 300 at Amaroo Park in a Mazda RX-7 (Alan Jones was to drive with Bob Morris in the Falcon in the Oran Park 250 endurance race, but elected after the race started to let Morris drive the 100 lap race solo. Morris went on to win the race). 1984 brought a top six finish at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Kremer Racing, and a top four finish at the Bathurst 1000, again teaming with Warren Cullen in a Holden VK Commodore. Cullen and Jones, who drove the final stint in the race and required pain killing injections after having the steering wheel wrench out of his hands during practice which damaged ligaments in his elbow, were unlucky not to finish 2nd, but a brake problem with the car saw him forced to use more fuel than normal and a late race stop for fuel allowed the Holden Dealer Team VK Commodore of David Parsons and John Harvey to sneak into 2nd and the Mazda RX-7 of Allan Moffat and Gregg Hansford to claim 3rd.

Jones was quickly snapped up as teammate to Colin Bond in Bond&#x27;s newly formed factory supported Network Alfa touring car team for the 1985 Australian Touring Car Championship driving an underpowered Alfa Romeo GTV6 in Australia&#x27;s first full year using the international Group A touring car rules. After some giant killing performances in the early rounds of the championship, Jones abandoned his first serious ATCC campaign to make his second Formula One comeback with the Haas Lola team.

Jones joined Kremer Racing for the 1984 24 Hours of Le Mans where he would share a Porsche 956B with 1983 Le Mans winner (and fellow Aussie) Vern Schuppan along with former F1 driver Jean-Pierre Jarier. After dicing for the lead with the pole sitting Lancia LC2 of Bob Wollek and Alessandro Nannini for the first third of the race, damage caused when Schuppan was the innocent victim of a spinning Roger Dorchy, and finally a broken conrod, saw Jones finish his first 24 Hours of Le Mans start in 6th place. Jones had previously driven for the Kremer brothers when he and Schuppan drove a 956 to 5th place in the 1983 1000 km of Silversone. Later in 1984, Jones drove with Schuppan for the factory backed Rothmans Porsche team at the 1000 km of Sandown Park, the final round of the 1984 World Sportscar Championship and the first ever FIA World Championship race to be held in Australia. After Schuppan qualified the Porsche 956B 3rd behind teammates Stefan Bellof and Jochen Mass, Jones started the race and got the jump on the West German pair and had the honour of leading the first lap of the first FIA World Championship race ever held in Australia. Jones and Schuppan eventually finished 9th, 12 laps down on Bellof and Derek Bell after numerous punctures.

On 20 September 1987 at SUGO Jones won a round of All Japan Touring Car Championship driving Toyota Team Tom&#x27;s, Group A Toyota Supra MA70 Turbo. Unfortunately the factory backed Supra could not compete, even with the Private Ford Sierras, thus for the remaining two JGTC races he scored only one additional podium on 6 December at Suzuka where he finished 3rd. After returning home again in 1987 his career did not pick up again until a competitive 3rd placing at the 1988 Bathurst 1000 with Colin Bond&#x27;s team in a Ford Sierra RS500, saw him signed up as full-time number two driver to Tony Longhurst in Longhurst&#x27;s Frank Gardner run team to drive a Sierra in 1990. The Benson &amp; Hedges sponsored Sierra&#x27;s were brutally fast but disappointingly fragile and results were again elusive. The team switched to BMW M3 Evolution&#x27;s in 1991 saw the return of reliability at the cost of speed. Jones took the occasional podium result while Longhurst took two wins against the all-powerful Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R&#x27;s. A switch to Glenn Seton Racing mid-season in 1992 brought improved results and race wins and he finished runner up to his team leader Glenn Seton as their V8 Ford Falcons dominated the 1993 Australian Touring Car Championship. Jones&#x27; reputation as a hard charger was shown in the 1993 ATCC when he was involved in a number of incidents, most notably pushing the Holden Commodore of Mark Skaife off the track at Symmons Plains Raceway before also doing the same to the Holden Racing Team&#x27;s Commodore driven by Australia&#x27;s 1987 500cc Grand Prix motorcycle World Champion Wayne Gardner less than half a lap later. Rule changes to make the Commodores more competitive saw the team&#x27;s dominance fade over the next few years. The 1995 Bathurst 1000 looked to be a high point with a memorable 1–2 finish for their two cars fading into just a second for the car Jones shared with veteran Allan Grice, the pair finishing behind the Holden Commodore of ex-F1 driver Larry Perkins and Russell Ingall (Seton, leading by 5 seconds with just 9 laps remaining, retired with a dead engine).

By this point the team was sundering apart and Jones took the major sponsor (Philip Morris International) to form a new team with engineering brothers Ross and Jim Stone as partners, known commercially as Pack Leader Racing (the Pack Leader name came about as the use of the Peter Jackson cigarette brand was banned following the Australian Government&#x27;s blanket ban on all cigarette advertising from 1 January 1996). Initially fast, the partnership was fading by 1997 and the Stones bought Jones out, re-badging the team as Stone Brothers Racing. Jones returned to race with Tony Longhurst&#x27;s Longhurst Racing team again in 1998 by this time his form was fading. From 1999 onwards he no longer raced full-time, driving just the endurance races as a hired gun. His final race was with Dick Johnson Racing, driving into a 7th-placed finish at the 2002 Bathurst 1000.

===CART===
In August 1985, one month before his return to Formula One at the Italian Grand Prix, Jones&#x27; association with Team Haas owner Carl Haas saw him used as a substitute for injured Newman/Haas Racing driver (and World F1 Champion) Mario Andretti in a Champ Car World Series race at Road America in Wisconsin. In his only IndyCar start and showing he had lost none of the speed, skill and determination that took him to the World Championship, Jones drove Andretti&#x27;s Lola T900-Cosworth to third place behind Jacques Villeneuve Sr. (winner) and Mario&#x27;s son Michael Andretti (2nd).

===A1 Grand Prix===
Jones then become involved in the Australian franchise of the A1 Grand Prix as Team Director in 2005 until the series demise in 2010.

===Grand Prix Masters===
He attempted to race in the Grand Prix Masters World Series at Kyalami in November 2005 but had to pull out before qualifying due to neck pains.

===Media===
After retiring from F1 for good after 1986, Jones became a commentator with Channel Nine as part of their Formula One coverage in Australia in , a role which lasted until 2002 with change of network rights for Formula 1. This association with Nine saw him hosting F1 telecasts from Nine&#x27;s Sydney studios working mostly with Darrell Eastlake, but sometimes with former Grand Prix motorcycle World Champion Barry Sheene on 500cc Grand Prix telecasts. Jones also worked as a pit reporter during the Australian Grand Prix where his relationships with those in F1 made it easier for him to obtain relevant information, and also as a pit reporter for Nine&#x27;s broadcasts of the Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix.

In March 2013, Jones signed with Network Ten as a commentator for their Formula One coverage where he joins regular hosts Matthew White and former MotoGP rider Daryl Beattie.

===Author===
His autobiography &quot;AJ: How Alan Jones Climbed to the top of Formula One&quot; has been co-authored with motorsport writer Andrew Clarke was released in August 2017 by Penguin Random House.

==Personal life==
Jones separated from his wife Beverley in the late 1980s. In 1996 he began a relationship with Amanda Butler Davis and in 2001 their twins, Zara and Jack, were born.

Jones also has a daughter, Camilla, born in 1990.

Jones&#x27; adopted son Christian now races in various forms of motorsport.

His eldest daughter, Emma, has two daughters (born 2001 and 2004).

==Honours and awards==
Jones was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1980 for &quot;service to motor racing&quot; and was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1989.

Jones and his father Stan, along with Graham and Damon Hill, and Keke and Nico Rosberg, are the only father/son combinations to ever win the Australian Grand Prix.

<text>Multitrack recording (MTR), also known as multitracking, is a method of sound recording developed in 1955 that allows for the separate recording of multiple sound sources or of sound sources recorded at different times to create a cohesive whole. Multitracking became possible in the mid-1950s when the idea of simultaneously recording different audio channels to separate discrete &quot;tracks&quot; on the same reel-to-reel tape was developed. A &quot;track&quot; was simply a different channel recorded to its own discrete area on the tape whereby their relative sequence of recorded events would be preserved, and playback would be simultaneous or synchronized.

A multitrack recorder allows one or more sound sources to different tracks to be simultaneously recorded, which may subsequently be processed and mixed separately. Take, for example, a band with vocals, guitars, a keyboard, bass, and drums that are to be recorded. The singer&#x27;s microphone, the output of the guitars and keys, and each individual drum in the kit can all be recorded separately using a multitrack recorder. This allows each track to be fine-tuned individually, such as increasing the voice or lowering the chimes, before combining them into the final product.

Prior to the development of multitracking, the sound recording process required all of the singers, band instrumentalists, and/or orchestra accompanists to perform at the same time in the same space. Multitrack recording was a significant technical improvement as it allowed studio engineers to record all of the instruments and vocals for a piece of music separately. Multitracking allowed the engineer to adjust the levels and tone of each individual track, and if necessary, redo certain tracks or overdub parts of the track to correct errors or get a better &quot;take&quot;. Also, different electronic effects such as reverb could be applied to specific tracks, such as the lead vocals, while not being applied to other tracks where this effect would not be desirable (e.g., on the electric bass). Multitrack recording was much more than a technical innovation; it also enabled record producers and artists to create new sounds that would be impossible to create outside of the studio, such as a lead singer adding many harmony vocals with their own voice to their own lead vocal part, an electric guitar player playing many harmony parts along with their own guitar solo, or even recording the drums and replaying the track backwards for an unusual effect.

In the 1980s and 1990s, computers provided means by which both sound recording and reproduction could be digitized, revolutionizing audio recording and distribution. In the 2000s, multitracking hardware and software for computers was of sufficient quality to be widely used for high-end audio recordings by both professional sound engineers and by bands recording without studios using widely available programs, which can be used on a high-end laptop computer. Though magnetic tape has not been replaced as a recording medium, the advantages of non-linear editing (NLE) and recording have resulted in digital systems largely superseding tape. Even in the 2010s, with digital multitracking being the dominant technology, the original word &quot;track&quot; is still used by audio engineers.

==Process==

Multitracking can be achieved with analogue recording, tape-based equipment (from simple, late-1970s cassette-based four-track Portastudios, to eight-track cassette machines, to 2&quot; reel-to-reel 24-track machines), digital equipment that relies on tape storage of recorded digital data (such as ADAT eight-track machines) and hard disk-based systems often employing a computer and audio recording software. Multi-track recording devices vary in their specifications, such as the number of simultaneous tracks available for recording at any one time; in the case of tape-based systems this is limited by, among other factors, the physical size of the tape employed.

With the introduction of SMPTE timecode in the early 1970s, engineers began to use computers to perfectly synchronize separate audio and video playback, or multiple audio tape machines. In this system, one track of each machine carried the timecode signal, while the remaining tracks were available for sound recording. Some large studios were able to link multiple 24-track machines together. An extreme example of this occurred in 1982, when the rock group Toto recorded parts of &quot;Toto IV&quot; on three synchronized 24-track machines. This setup theoretically provided for up to 69 audio tracks.

In the late 1970s and 1980s, digital multitrack tape machines emerged, including the 3M and Mitsubishi X-800 32-track machines, and Sony DASH PCM-3324 and later the PCM-3348 machines, which allowed greater flexibility with more available tracks for recording. As well, in order to mix using automation on the console, analogue recorders generally required adjacent tracks to the time code track to be kept blank to avoid the time code signal interfering with the audio signals, which limited available tracks to 22 or 23 track at most. Digital multitrack machines had time code inserted elsewhere on the tape, and thus did not require allocating it to an audio track, which meant all tracks were available for recording. What&#x27;s more, in the case of the PCM-3348, which doubled the number of tracks from the PCM-3324, both machines could use the same ½” digital tape, and also a 24-track reel first recorded on a PCM-3324 was able to be used on a PCM-3348 and have another 24 tracks overdubbed.

For computer-based systems, the trend in the 2000s is towards unlimited numbers of record/playback tracks, although issues such as RAM memory and CPU available do limit this from machine to machine. Moreover, on computer-based systems, the number of simultaneously available recording tracks is limited by the number of sound card discrete analog or digital inputs.

When recording, audio engineers can select which track (or tracks) on the device will be used for each instrument, voice, or other input and can even blend one track with two instruments to vary the music and sound options available. At any given point on the tape, any of the tracks on the recording device can be recording or playing back using sel-sync or Selective Synchronous recording. This allows an artist to be able to record onto track 2 and, simultaneously, listen to track 1, 3 and 7, allowing them to sing or to play an accompaniment to the performance already recorded on these tracks. They might then record an alternate version on track 4 while listening to the other tracks. All the tracks can then be played back in perfect synchrony, as if they had originally been played and recorded together. This can be repeated until all of the available tracks have been used, or in some cases, reused. During mixdown, a separate set of playback heads with higher fidelity are used.

Before all tracks are filled, any number of existing tracks can be &quot;bounced&quot; into one or two tracks, and the original tracks erased, making more room for more tracks to be reused for fresh recording. In 1963, the Beatles were using twin track for &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. The Beatles&#x27; producer George Martin used this technique extensively to achieve multiple-track results, while still being limited to using only multiple four-track machines, until an eight-track machine became available during the recording of the Beatles&#x27; self-titled ninth album. The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; also made innovative use of multitracking with eight-track machines of the day (circa 1965). Motown also began recording with eight-track machines in 1965, before moving to 16-track machines in mid-1969.

Multitrack recording also allows any recording artist to record multiple &quot;takes&quot; of any given section of their performance, allowing them to refine their performance to virtual perfection by making additional &quot;takes&quot; of songs or instrumental tracks. A recording engineer can record only the section being worked on, without erasing any other section of that track. This process of turning the recording mechanism on and off is called punching in and punching out.

When recording is completed, the many tracks are &quot;mixed down&quot; through a mixing console to a two-track stereo recorder in a format which can then be duplicated and distributed. (Movie and DVD soundtracks can be mixed down to four or more tracks, as needed, the most common being five tracks, with an additional low-frequency effects track, hence the &quot;5.1&quot; surround sound most commonly available on DVDs.)

Most of the records, CDs and cassettes commercially available in a music store are recordings that were originally recorded on multiple tracks, and then mixed down to stereo. In some rare cases, as when an older song is technically &quot;updated&quot;, these stereo (or mono) mixes can in turn be recorded (as if it were a &quot;submix&quot;) onto two (or one) tracks of a multitrack recorder, allowing additional sound (tracks) to be layered on the remaining tracks.

==Flexibility==
During multitracking, multiple musical instruments (and vocals) can be recorded, either one at a time or simultaneously, onto individual tracks, so that the sounds thus recorded can be accessed, processed and manipulated individually to produce the desired results. In the 2010s, many rock and pop bands record each part of the song one after the other. First, the bass and drums are often recorded, followed by the chordal rhythm section instruments. Then the lead vocals and guitar solos are added. As a last step, the harmony vocals are added. On the other hand, orchestras are always recorded with all 70 to 100 instrumentalists playing their parts simultaneously. If each group of instrument has its own microphone, and each instrument with a solo melody has its own microphone, the different microphones can record on multiple tracks simultaneously. After recording the orchestra, the record producer and conductor can adjust the balance and tone of the different instrument sections and solo instruments, because each section and solo instrument was recorded to its own track.

With the rock or pop band example, after recording some parts of a song, an artist might listen to &quot;only&quot; the guitar part, by &quot;muting&quot; all the tracks except the one on which the guitar was recorded. If one then wanted to listen to the lead vocals in isolation, one would do so by muting all the tracks apart from the lead vocals track. If one wanted to listen to the entire song, one could do so by un-muting all the tracks. If one did not like the guitar part, or found a mistake in it, and wanted to replace it, one could do so by re-recording &quot;only&quot; the guitar part (i.e., re-recording only the track on which the guitar was recorded), rather than re-recording the entire song.

If all the voices and instruments in a recording are individually recorded on distinct tracks, then the artist is able to retain complete control over the final sculpting of the song, during the mix-down (re-recording to two stereo tracks for mass distribution) phase. For example, if an artist wanted to apply one effects unit to a synthesizer part, a different effect to a guitar part, a &quot;chorused reverb&quot; effect to the lead vocals, and different effects to all the drums and percussion instruments, they could not do so if they had all been originally recorded together onto the same track. However, if they had been recorded onto separate tracks, then the artist could blend and alter all of the instrument and vocal sounds with complete freedom.

Multitracking a song also leaves open the possibilities of remixes by the same or future artists, such as DJs. If the song was not available in a multitrack format recording, the job of the remixing artist was very difficult, or impossible, because, once the tracks had been re-recorded together onto a single track (&#x27;mixed down&#x27;), they were previously considered inseparable. More recent software allows sound source separation, whereby individual instruments, voices and effects can be &quot;upmixed&quot; — isolated from a single-track source — in high quality. This has permitted the production of stereophonic or surround sound mixes of recordings that were originally mastered and released in mono.

==History==

The process was conceived and developed by Ross Snyder at Ampex in 1955 resulting in the first Sel-Sync machine, an 8-track machine which used one-inch tape. This 8-track recorder was sold to the American guitarist, songwriter, luthier, and inventor Les Paul for $10,000. It became known as the Octopus. Les Paul, Mary Ford and Patti Page used the technology in the late 1950s to enhance vocals and instruments. From these beginnings, it evolved in subsequent decades into a mainstream recording technique.

==With computers==
Since the early 1990s, many performers have recorded music using only a Mac or PC equipped with multitrack recording software as a tracking machine. The computer must have a sound card or other type of audio interface with one or more Analog-to-digital converters. Microphones are needed to record the sounds of vocalists or acoustic instruments. Depending on the capabilities of the system, some instruments, such as a synthesizer or electric guitar, can also be sent to an interface directly using Line level or MIDI inputs. Direct inputs eliminate the need for microphones and can provide another range of sound control options.

There are tremendous differences in computer audio interfaces. Such units vary widely in price, sound quality, and flexibility. The most basic interfaces use audio circuitry that is built into the computer motherboard. The most sophisticated audio interfaces are external units of professional studio quality which can cost thousands of dollars. Professional interfaces usually use one or more IEEE 1394 (commonly known as FireWire) connections. Other types of interfaces may use internal PCI cards, or external USB connections. Popular manufacturers of high-quality interfaces include Apogee Electronics, Avid Audio (formerly Digidesign), Echo Digital Audio, Focusrite, MOTU, RME Audio, M-Audio and PreSonus.

Microphones are often designed for highly specific applications and have a major effect on recording quality. A single studio-quality microphone can cost $5,000 or more, while consumer-quality recording microphones can be bought for less than $50 each. Microphones also need some type of microphone preamplifier to prepare the signal for use by other equipment. These preamplifiers can also have a major effect on the sound and come in different price ranges, physical configurations, and capability levels. Microphone preamplifiers may be external units or a built-in feature of other audio equipment.

===Software===
Software for multitrack recording can record multiple tracks at once. It generally uses graphic notation for an interface and offers a number of views of the music. Most multitrackers also provide audio playback capability. Some multitrack software also provides MIDI playback functions not just for audio; during playback the MIDI data is sent to a softsynth or virtual instrument (e.g., VSTi) which converts the data to audio sound. Multitrack software may also provide other features that qualify it being called a digital audio workstation (DAW). These features may include various displays including showing the score of the music, as well as editing capability. There is often overlap between many of the categories of musical software. In this case, scorewriters and full-featured multitrackers such as DAWs have similar features for playback but may have less similarity for editing and recording.

Multitrack recording software varies widely in price and capability. Popular multitrack recording software programs include: Reason, Ableton Live, FL Studio, Adobe Audition, Pro Tools, Digital Performer, Cakewalk Sonar, Samplitude, Nuendo, Cubase and Logic. Lower-cost alternatives include Mixcraft, REAPER and n-Track Studio. Open-source and free software programs are also available for multitrack recording. These range from very basic programs such as Jokosher to Ardour and Audacity, which are capable of performing many functions of the most sophisticated programs.

Instruments and voices are usually recorded as individual files on a computer hard drive. These function as tracks which can be added, removed or processed in many ways. Effects such as reverb, chorus, and delays can be applied by electronic devices or by computer software. Such effects are used to shape the sound as desired by the producer. When the producer is satisfied with the recorded sound finished tracks can be mixed into a new stereo pair of tracks within the multitrack recording software. Finally, the final stereo recording can be written to a CD, which can be copied and distributed.

==Order of recording==
In modern popular songs, drums, percussion instruments and electric bass are often among the first instruments to be recorded.
These are the core instruments of the rhythm section. Musicians recording later tracks use the precise attack of the drum sounds as a rhythmic guide. In some styles, the drums may be recorded for a few bars and then looped. Click (metronome) tracks are also often used as the first sound to be recorded, especially when the drummer is not available for the initial recording, and/or the final mix will be synchronized with motion picture and/or video images. One reason that a band may start with just the drums is because this allows the band to pick the song&#x27;s key later on. The producer and the musicians can experiment with the song&#x27;s key and arrangement against the basic rhythm track. Also, though the drums might eventually be mixed down to a couple of tracks, each individual drum and percussion instrument might be initially recorded to its own individual track. The drums and percussion combined can occupy a large number of tracks utilized in a recording. This is done so that each percussion instrument can be processed individually for maximum effect. Equalization (or EQ) is often used on individual drums, to bring out each one&#x27;s characteristic sound. The last tracks recorded are often the vocals (though a temporary vocal track may be recorded early on either as a reference or to guide subsequent musicians; this is sometimes called a &quot;guide vocal&quot;, &quot;ghost vocal&quot; or &quot;scratch vocal&quot;). One reason for this is that singers will often temper their vocal expression in accordance with the accompaniment. Producers and songwriters can also use the guide/scratch vocal when they have not quite ironed out all the lyrics or for flexibility based on who sings the lead vocal (as The Alan Parsons Project&#x27;s Eric Woolfson often did).

==Concert music==
For classical and jazz recordings, particularly instrumentals where multitracking is chosen as the recording method (as opposed to direct to stereo, for example), a different arrangement is used; all tracks are recorded simultaneously. Sound barriers are often placed between different groups within the orchestra, e.g. pianists, violinists, percussionists, etc. When barriers are used, these groups listen to each other via headphones.

Multitrack live recording is a lot like gigging – a lot of planning ahead of time, a lot of gear to carry and set up, a lot of waiting, and then a lot of hectic activity over the next 40 minutes or so! There is little doubt that a pseudolive studio performance can enhance certain forms of music, particularly those with a lot of intensity in the live performance, but it still lacks the atmosphere of a real gig. You may record the moment with a portable setup during the performance. You can produce wonderful live recordings with just two microphones and a building&#x27;s inherent acoustics, but that will have to wait for another day. Taking a feed from the front of house (or FOH) desk directly to tape or DAT is another technique of live recording, although this will only work in large venues where everything is run through the PA system. Even so, a loud backline will result in less guitar and bass being routed via the main PA system, resulting in an unbalanced mix. A multitrack recording has distinct advantages: it allows you more control after the event because you may fine-tune the mix and correct any obvious mistakes without sacrificing the thrill of the live performance. It does, however, necessitate a lot more pre-gig planning as well as a lot more equipment.

<text>Suure-Jaani () is a town in the northern part of the county of Viljandimaa in Põhja-Sakala rural municipality, 25 kilometres north of the town of Viljandi. Until 2017, Suure-Jaani was the administrative centre of Suure-Jaani rural municipality.

==History==
The oldest archaeological findings from the area date back to the 6th millennium B.C. At the end of the 12th century A.D., the Lehola hill fort of ancient Estonians was built at a location (now known as Lõhavere) approximately two kilometres north-east of the present town border. The hill fort was the centre of the northernmost district (Estonian: &quot;kihelkond&quot;) in the historical Estonian county of Sakala and also one of the centres of Estonians&#x27; fight against the conquest of German Sword Brethren in the 13th century, including in the Battle of Lehola. Not much except the hill remains of it but the place (known in Estonian also as &quot;Lembitu linnamägi&quot;) is still visited as a tourist attraction. 2/3 of the hill-fort have been excavated archaeologically.

The locality of Suure-Jaani was initially called Wallola (or &quot;Valle&quot;), first recorded in 1423(?). The town began to develop around the (now Lutheran) Church of Great Saint John the Evangelist (&quot;Groß Sankt Johannis&quot; in German), built before the year 1300. There is a Lutheran cemetery near the church. The church was severely damaged during the Livonian War (1558–1582) and the Great Northern War (1700–1721), particularly the latter (the church was burnt down in 1703 and the restoration was completed only in 1767). The present name, &quot;Suure-Jaani&quot; (literally meaning &quot;Great John&#x27;s&quot;), which came into widespread use for the locality only in the 1880s, when it developed into a village in its own right, is an Estonian derivative from the German name of the church. Until then, the name &quot;Suure-Jaani&quot; was used only for the church as well as its immediate surroundings (the church estate), while other areas of the present town were separate villages: Valula (or Wallola; the southern part of the present town of Suure-Jaani), Nuutre (the eastern part) and Päraküla (or Perraküla; the north-western part; one part of the traditional Päraküla still being a separate village nowadays).

During centuries, Suure-Jaani was one of the centres of Suure-Jaani parish (which was in 1629–1721 administratively a part of Swedish Livonia, in 1721–1918 a part of the Governorate of Livonia and as from 1918 a part of the Republic of Estonia) and, since the end of the 19th century, also the cultural and commercial centre of the parish region.
In 1906–1908, Sts. Peter and Paul Orthodox Church was built at the village of Valula (now Suure-Jaani). The Orthodox congregation had already been established in the nearby village of Olustvere in 1847. In 1911, an Orthodox cemetery was established at Valula (now Suure-Jaani), replacing the former Orthodox cemetery, which was located in the village of Reegoldi near Olustvere. As from 1989 Sts. Peter and Paul Church was not used for services for a couple of decades but is being restored since 2018 and is being used, since the late 2010s, for Orthodox religious services again.

In 1924, Suure-Jaani was granted the rights of a town (Estonian: &quot;alev&quot;) and in 1938, it was granted city rights.

In 1950–1959, Suure-Jaani was the capital of Suure-Jaani District (of the Estonian SSR). The 1950s also marked the all-time peak number (approximately 1700) in the population of the town. During the administrative reform in 1960, Suure-Jaani District was dissolved and became part of the larger Viljandi District (now the county of Viljandimaa).

In 2005, a new Suure-Jaani rural municipality was formed by the town of Suure-Jaani (which had been a separate urban municipality until then), the former separate Suure-Jaani rural municipality and Olustvere and Vastemõisa rural municipalities. Therefore, the town is not a separate municipality any more but retains its city rights.

On 21 October 2017, Suure-Jaani rural municipality united with the city of Võhma and the Kõo and Kõpu rural municipalities to form the new Põhja-Sakala rural municipality.

==Geography==
Suure-Jaani is situated in Sakala Upland, offering picturesque views with its park, two artificial lakes and church in the centre of the town.

==Transport==
Due to its small size, Suure-Jaani has no urban transport. The town has a bus stop for intercity lines. The nearest railway station is at Olustvere (5 km). The nearest towns are Võhma (12 km), Viljandi (25 km), Põltsamaa (28 km) and Vändra (32 km). The distance of Suure-Jaani from Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, is 143 km.

==Culture==
During the Estonian national awakening period in the 19th century, Suure-Jaani parish was one of the regional centres of educational, cultural and social life (largely as a result of the efforts of schoolmaster and musician Joosep Kapp and also e.g. as the parish of origin of the first Estonian professional painter Johann Köler, who both actively contributed to the development and promotion of Estonian culture).

Presently, Suure-Jaani hosts the Suure-Jaani Music Festival, an annual summer festival of classical music started in 1998, dedicated to the Kapp family of composers. Suure-Jaani is also the place of establishment of the International Artur Kapp Society, a non-profit foundation for promoting the works and life of composer Artur Kapp and other composers related to Suure-Jaani, such as Mart Saar.

<text>Tanichthys is a genus of freshwater fish in the carp family (Cyprinidae) of order Cypriniformes. They are native to rivers and streams in China and Vietnam. Until recently, the type species, &quot;T. albonubes,&quot; was the only one known. In 2001, however, Freyhof and Herder described a new and very similar species, &quot;T. micagemmae,&quot; from the Ben Hai River in Vietnam and V. H. Nguyen &amp; S. V. Ngô described a third species from Vietnam.

The name &quot;Tanichthys&quot; comes from the name of the Chinese Boy Scout leader, Tan Kam Fei, who discovered the first specimen.

<doc id="255150" wikidata="Q682030" url="?curid=255150" title="The Tragically Hip">
<text>The Tragically Hip, often referred to simply as the Hip, was a Canadian rock band formed in Kingston, Ontario in 1984, consisting of vocalist Gord Downie, guitarist Paul Langlois, guitarist Rob Baker (known as Bobby Baker until 1994), bassist Gord Sinclair, and drummer Johnny Fay. They released 13 studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, and over 50 singles over a 33-year career. Nine of their albums have reached No. 1 on the Canadian charts. They have received numerous Canadian music awards, including 17 Juno Awards. Between 1996 and 2016, the Tragically Hip were the best-selling Canadian band in Canada and the fourth best-selling Canadian artist overall in Canada.

Following Downie&#x27;s diagnosis with terminal brain cancer in 2015, the band undertook a tour of Canada in support of their thirteenth album, &quot;Man Machine Poem&quot;. The tour&#x27;s final concert, which would ultimately be the band&#x27;s last show, was held at the Rogers K-Rock Centre in Kingston on August 20, 2016, and broadcast globally by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a cross-platform television, radio and internet streaming special.

After Downie died on October 17, 2017, the band announced in July 2018 that they would no longer perform under the name. The surviving members have, however, continued to pursue other musical projects, and have begun releasing deluxe reissues of their albums featuring previously unreleased songs from the band&#x27;s archives.

==History==

===Formation===
The Tragically Hip formed in 1984 in Kingston, Ontario. Gord Sinclair and Rob Baker were students at Kingston Collegiate and had performed together at the KCVI Variety Show as the Rodents. Baker and Sinclair joined with Downie and Fay in 1984 and began playing gigs around Kingston with some memorable stints at Clark Hall Pub and Alfie&#x27;s, student bars on Queen&#x27;s University campus. Guitarist Paul Langlois joined in 1986; saxophonist Davis Manning left that same year. They took their name from a skit in the Michael Nesmith movie &quot;Elephant Parts&quot;.

===1987–1991===
By the mid-1980s, they performed in small music venues across Ontario until being seen by then-MCA Vice President Bruce Dickinson at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto. They were then signed to a long-term record deal with MCA, and recorded the EP &quot;The Tragically Hip&quot;, released in 1987. The album produced two singles, &quot;Small Town Bring-Down&quot; and &quot;Highway Girl&quot;. They followed up with 1989&#x27;s &quot;Up to Here&quot;. This album produced four singles, &quot;Blow at High Dough&quot;, &quot;New Orleans Is Sinking&quot;, &quot;Boots or Hearts&quot;, and &quot;38 Years Old&quot;. All four of these songs found extensive rotation on modern rock radio play lists in Canada.

&quot;Road Apples&quot; followed in 1991, producing three singles (&quot;Little Bones&quot;, &quot;Twist My Arm&quot;, and &quot;Three Pistols&quot;) and reaching No. 1 on Canadian record charts. During the Road Apples tour, Downie became recognized for ranting and telling fictional stories during songs such as &quot;Highway Girl&quot; and &quot;New Orleans Is Sinking&quot;. Road Apples was planned to be a double album but was rejected by Universal. The 2008 Universal Studios fire resulted in the destruction of the masters for the second album. The six unreleased songs were rediscovered in another collection in 2020. In 2021 they were released as an EP titled &quot;Saskadelphia&quot;, which had been the working title for &quot;Road Apples.&quot;

The sound on these first two full-length albums is sometimes characterized as &quot;blues-tinged&quot;, although there is definite acoustic punctuation throughout both discs. Although the band failed to achieve significant international success with these first two albums, their sales and dominance of modern rock radio in Canada gave them license to subsequently explore their sound.

===1992–1997===
The band released another album, &quot;Fully Completely&quot; in 1992, which produced the singles &quot;Locked in the Trunk of a Car&quot;, &quot;Courage&quot;, &quot;At the Hundredth Meridian&quot;, and three others. The sound on this album displayed less of a blues influence than previous albums. The Hip created and headlined the first Another Roadside Attraction tour at this time, which also featured Midnight Oil, Crash Vegas, Hothouse Flowers and Daniel Lanois. The five artists on the tour collaborated together on the 1993 charity single &quot;Land&quot;, which protested forest clearcutting in British Columbia.

Many songs from &quot;Day For Night&quot; were first performed prior to their release during the 1993 Another Roadside Attraction Tour. &quot;Nautical Disaster&quot; was played frequently in the middle of &quot;New Orleans Is Sinking&quot;, an early version of &quot;Thugs&quot; was tested, and Downie sang lyrics from many other &quot;Day For Night&quot; songs, such as &quot;Grace, Too&quot;, &quot;Scared&quot;, and &quot;Emergency&quot;, during this tour.

&quot;Day for Night&quot; was then released in 1994, producing six singles, including &quot;Nautical Disaster&quot; and &quot;Grace, Too&quot;. &quot;Trouble at the Henhouse&quot; followed in 1996, producing five singles starting with &quot;Ahead by a Century&quot;, which reached number one on the &quot;RPM&quot; Canadian singles chart on 24 June and became their most successful single in their home country. &quot;Butts Wigglin&quot;, the fifth single from &quot;Henhouse&quot;, also appeared on the soundtrack to the Kids in the Hall movie &quot;Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy&quot;. The live album &quot;Live Between Us&quot; was recorded on the subsequent tour at Cobo Arena in Detroit, Michigan.

The band developed a unique sound and ethos, leaving behind its earlier blues influence. Downie&#x27;s vocal style changed while the band experimented with song structures and chord progressions. Songs explored the themes of Canadian geography and history, water and land, all motifs that became heavily associated with the Hip. While &quot;Fully Completely&quot; began an exploration of deeper themes, many critics consider &quot;Day for Night&quot; to be the Hip&#x27;s artistry most fully realized. The sound here is typically called &quot;enigmatic&quot; and &quot;dark&quot;, while critic MacKenzie Wilson praises &quot;the poignancy of Downie&#x27;s minimalism.&quot;

On the follow-up tour for this album, the band made its only appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, on March 25, 1995, thanks in large part to the finagling of fellow Canadian and Kingston-area resident Dan Aykroyd, who appeared on the show just to introduce them. Aykroyd, who is a fan of the band, had personally lobbied &quot;SNL&quot; showrunner Lorne Michaels to book them as a musical guest.

In July 1996, the Hip headlined Edenfest. The three-day concert took place at Mosport Park, in Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada, just a few months after the LP &quot;Trouble at the Henhouse&quot; was released. The concert sold over 70,000 tickets total and was attended by an estimated 20,000 additional people who gained access to the concert site after the outside security broke down.

===1998–2003===
In 1998, the band released their sixth full-length album, &quot;Phantom Power&quot;, which produced five singles. It won the 1999 Juno Awards for Best Rock Album and Best Album Design. A single from the album, &quot;Bobcaygeon&quot;, won the Juno Award for Single of the Year in 2000. The album has been certified platinum three times over in Canada.

In February 1999, the Hip played the first concert at the brand new Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario. In July 1999, the band was part of the lineup for the Woodstock &#x27;99 festival in Rome, New York. On the second day of three, they were the first band to take the stage. They were followed by Kid Rock.

Their next album, Music @ Work&quot;,&quot; was released in 2000. It won the 2001 Juno Award for Best Rock Album. The album featured back-up vocals from Julie Doiron on a number of tracks, and reached No. 1 on the Canadian Billboard Charts.

In 2002, &quot;In Violet Light,&quot; recorded by Hugh Padgham and Terry Manning at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas was released, along with three singles from the album. It became certified platinum in Canada. Later that year, the Hip made a cameo appearance in the Paul Gross film &quot;Men with Brooms,&quot; playing a curling team from their hometown of Kingston. Three of their songs appear in the film, and they backed Sarah Harmer on a fourth, the soundtrack&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Silver Roads&quot;.

On October 10, 2002, the Tragically Hip performed two songs, &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life If You Don&#x27;t Weaken&quot; and &quot;Poets&quot;, as part of a command performance for Queen Elizabeth II. In 2003, the band recorded a cover of &quot;Black Day in July&quot;, a song about the 1967 12th Street Riot in Detroit, on &quot;&quot;.

===2004–2008===
&quot;In Between Evolution&quot; was released in 2004 in the No. 1 position in Canada. It has since sold over 100,000 copies.

At the 92nd Grey Cup held November 21, 2004, the band provided the halftime entertainment in front of a packed house at Frank Clair Stadium in Ottawa.

In 2004, in episode 15 (&quot;Rock On&quot;), season 2 of Canadian comedy TV series &quot;Corner Gas&quot;, the Tragically Hip gave a cameo appearance as an unnamed local band rehearsing in Brent&#x27;s garage. They play a rough version of the song &quot;It Can&#x27;t Be Nashville Every Night&quot; from their &quot;In Between Evolution&quot; album until interrupted and asked to leave by Brent, Wanda, and Hank. As they disappointedly go, Wanda demands that Gord Sinclair and Rob Baker leave behind their amplifiers.

In October 2005, several radio stations temporarily stopped playing &quot;New Orleans Is Sinking&quot;, out of sensitivity to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, which had devastated the city in early September of that year. However, it received considerable pirate radio and relief site play and gained some notoriety and praise in New Orleans due to its attitudinal proximity to the city&#x27;s culture.

On November 1, 2005, the Hip released a double CD, double DVD box set, &quot;Hipeponymous&quot;, including all of their singles and music videos to date, a backstage documentary called &quot;Macroscopic&quot;, an animated Hip-scored short film entitled &quot;The Right Whale&quot;, two brand new songs (&quot;No Threat&quot; and &quot;The New Maybe&quot;), a full-length concert from November 2004 &quot;That Night in Toronto&quot;, and a 2-CD greatest hits collection &quot;Yer Favourites&quot; (selected on-line by 150,000 fans). On November 8, 2005, &quot;Yer Favourites&quot; and &quot;That Night in Toronto&quot; were released individually.

In 2006, another studio album, entitled &quot;World Container&quot;, was released, being notably produced by Bob Rock. It produced four singles, and reached the No. 1 spot on the Canadian rock music charts. The band toured concert dates in major Canadian cities, and then as an opening act for the Who on several US dates. A tour of Eastern Canada, Europe, and select cities in the United States occurred late in the year.

On February 23, 2008, the Hip returned to their hometown of Kingston, Ontario, where they were the first live act to perform at the new K-Rock Centre.

===2009–2015===
In 2009, the band again worked with producer Bob Rock, and &quot;We Are the Same&quot; was released in North America on April 7, 2009. It produced three singles. To promote &quot;We Are the Same&quot;, the band invited The Hour&#x27;s George Stroumboulopoulos for a live interview at The Bathouse Recording Studio in Bath, Ontario (where most of the album was recorded), and they played seven new songs as well as unique versions of five other songs. The interview and performance were broadcast live in more than eighty theatres across Canada.

On January 22, 2010, the band performed &quot;Fiddler&#x27;s Green&quot; at the &quot;Canada for Haiti&quot; telethon to aid earthquake victims in that country. This was broadcast nationally on all three of Canada&#x27;s main networks (CBC, Global, and CTV).

Single &quot;At Transformation&quot; was released in May 2012 ahead of the band&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;Now for Plan A.&quot; A second single, &quot;Streets Ahead&quot; came out in August that year, and the album followed in October.

The Tragically Hip re-entered their studio in July 2014 to begin work on a new album. The following October, &quot;Fully Completely&quot; was re-released as a remastered deluxe edition, including two bonus tracks, a vinyl edition and a recording of a live show. To celebrate and promote the re-release, the band toured Canada and the United States from January to October 2015.

===2016–2017: Downie&#x27;s diagnosis, summer tour, and death===

In December 2015, Downie was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. The band announced his diagnosis on May 24, 2016. The band also announced that, despite his condition, they would tour that summer.

The Hip&#x27;s thirteenth album, &quot;Man Machine Poem&quot;, was released on June 17, 2016. The album featured songs such as &quot;In a World Possessed by the Human Mind&quot;, &quot;In Sarnia&quot;, and &quot;Machine&quot;.

The final concert of the Man Machine Poem tour was held at the Rogers K-Rock Centre in the band&#x27;s hometown of Kingston on August 20, 2016. The concert was aired by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a live cross-platform broadcast on CBC Television, CBC Radio One, CBC Radio 2, CBC Music, and YouTube. The concert featured 30 songs and three encore sets, with the band finishing with a performance of &quot;Ahead by a Century&quot;. The CBC&#x27;s broadcast and live streaming of the concert, uninterrupted by advertisements, was watched by 11.7 million people (roughly one-third of the Canadian population).

On October 13, 2016, Downie gave an interview, his first since his cancer diagnosis, to the CBC&#x27;s Peter Mansbridge, in which he reported experiencing memory loss. Downie also told Mansbridge that he was working with the Tragically Hip on new studio material, and that the band have up to four albums worth of unreleased material in the vaults.

Downie released his fifth solo album, &quot;Secret Path&quot; on October 18, 2016. The album is a concept album about Chanie Wenjack, a First Nations boy who escaped from a Canadian Indian residential school in 1966 and died while attempting to make the 600 km walk back to his home.

On December 22, 2016, Downie was selected as The Canadian Press&#x27; Canadian Newsmaker of the Year and was the first entertainer ever selected for the title.

On June 15, 2017, all five members of the Tragically Hip were announced as recipients of the Order of Canada by Governor General of Canada David Johnston. Downie received his honour on June 19; the other four members of the band were invested on November 17.

The band and the tour are the subjects of Jennifer Baichwal and Nicholas de Pencier&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Long Time Running&quot;, which premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. It was slated to have its television premiere in November 2017 on CTV, but following Downie&#x27;s death the network moved the broadcast up to October 20.

Gord Downie died on October 17, 2017. His death was widely mourned throughout Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is a fan of the Tragically Hip, released a tribute statement on his official website the morning after Downie&#x27;s death. Later in the day, he held a press conference at Parliament Hill at which he eulogized Downie as &quot;Our buddy Gord, who loved this country with everything he had—and not just loved it in a nebulous, &#x27;Oh, I love Canada&#x27; way. He loved every hidden corner, every story, every aspect of this country that he celebrated his whole life.&quot;

Following Downie&#x27;s death, many of the band&#x27;s albums climbed the &quot;Billboard&quot; Canadian Albums chart, which is compiled by Neilsen Music. In the week ending October 19, 2017 (the day following the announcement of Downie&#x27;s death), &quot;Yer Favourites&quot; rose to No. 2 in the chart, with another 10 albums moving to the Top 200. Streaming also increased 700 percent, and many of the Tragically Hip&#x27;s top hits remained on the Spotify Canadian Viral 50 as of October 23, 2017.

===2018–present: Activity following Downie&#x27;s death===

Before his death, Downie indicated in interviews that the band had unreleased material that may still be issued as one or more new albums; when accepting Downie&#x27;s posthumous awards at the Juno Awards of 2018, his brothers Patrick and Mike also stated that more unreleased music is likely to be issued in the future.

&quot;A National Celebration&quot;, a concert film of the Tragically Hip&#x27;s final concert, was released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 8, 2017.

In July 2018, guitarist Rob Baker told &quot;Entertainment Tonight Canada&quot; that the Tragically Hip were no longer active as a touring or recording entity following Downie&#x27;s death. He stated &quot;When I say The Tragically Hip doesn&#x27;t exist as a performing unit anymore because a key member is gone, I think [fans] understand that. We wouldn&#x27;t be The Hip without Gord [...] The Hip has played their last note.&quot; Baker also revealed that Downie had encouraged the group to audition replacement vocalists, but the other members did not seriously consider the idea. With the legalization of marijuana in Canada, the remaining band members became investment partners in Newstrike, a cannabis company which has named several of its products after Tragically Hip songs.

In a July 2018 interview with the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, Baker confirmed that at least three albums&#x27; worth of unreleased material was recorded with Downie before his death, but stated that the band had yet to decide how it would be released.

On October 11, 2018, six days before the first anniversary of Downie&#x27;s death, Fay and Baker joined Choir! Choir! Choir! at Yonge-Dundas Square for a live performance of the Tragically Hip&#x27;s &quot;Grace, Too&quot;.

On October 17, 2018, one year after Downie&#x27;s death, a previously unreleased studio recording of the song &quot;Wait So Long&quot; was played on CIKR-FM, a radio station in the band&#x27;s hometown of Kingston.

The Tragically Hip was among hundreds of artists whose material was reported to have been destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire but it later emerged that the band&#x27;s master tapes had been transferred back to Canada in 2001, and had escaped the fire.

On September 14, 2019, Langlois, Sinclair and Baker performed a set at Rockin&#x27; the Big House, a benefit concert on the grounds of the former Kingston Penitentiary, with guest vocalists Hugh Dillon and Tom Cochrane.

In January 2020, Sinclair announced that his own debut album as a solo artist, &quot;Taxi Dancers&quot;, would be released on February 28.

In June 2020, the band and manager Jake Gold announced that they were undertaking an &quot;archaeological dig&quot; to select music and memorabilia from the band&#x27;s archives for future release.

In early 2021, Rob Baker released a new album with his side band project, Stripper&#x27;s Union.

The band released &quot;Saskadelphia&quot;, an EP comprising five previously unreleased and recently found &quot;Road Apples&quot; outtakes and a live track (as the original version has yet to be found). &quot;Road Apples&quot; was planned to be a double album, but was rejected by the label. Many songs were presumed to be destroyed in the Universal fire in 2008, but the masters were found and transferred to new recordings in 2019. &quot;Saskadelphia&quot; was released on May 21, 2021.

At the Juno Awards of 2021, the surviving members of the Tragically Hip performed their 2002 single &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life If You Don&#x27;t Weaken&quot; with Feist on lead vocals, which marked the band&#x27;s first televised performance since Downie&#x27;s death, this performance would later be released in 2024 as a single. In a promotional interview on CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Q&quot; before the ceremony, the band stated that they agreed to perform specifically because Feist had been proposed as the vocalist, with Langlois stating that &quot;OK, so that&#x27;s not going to be some guy trying to sing like Gord or some guy trying not to sing like Gord. It was a &#x27;no&#x27; until Feist came up.&quot; The band also received the Juno Humanitarian Award at the ceremony for their history of philanthropic work in Canada. This performance was officially released as a single in December 2024.

In November 2021, the band released a 30th anniversary boxed set for &quot;Road Apples&quot;. 

On June 24, 2022, the band released &quot;Live at the Roxy&quot;, a live recording of their May 3, 1991 concert at the Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood, California. In September 2022, the surviving members again reunited to perform at the Buffy Sainte-Marie tribute show &quot;Buffy Sainte-Marie: Starwalker&quot;, supporting singer-songwriter William Prince on Sainte-Marie&#x27;s &quot;Now That the Buffalo&#x27;s Gone&quot;. In October 2022, the band continued their reissue campaign with an expanded box set for the 30th anniversary of &quot;Fully Completely&quot;.

On January 22, 2023, saxophonist Davis Manning passed away. In November 2023, the band released a 25th anniversary boxed set for their 1998 LP, &quot;Phantom Power&quot;.

In 2024, the band released a 40th anniversary boxed set of &quot;Up To Here&quot;. On September 20, 2024, the four-part documentary series, &quot;The Tragically Hip: No Dress Rehearsal&quot;, premiered on Prime Video. On the same day as &quot;The Tragically Hip: No Dress Rehearsal&quot; was released to streaming services, the previously unreleased song, &quot;Wait So Long&quot;, an outtake from the &quot;Up To Here&quot; recording sessions, was released digitally on streaming platforms. In October 2024, the band released an anthology limited edition book, entitled &quot;This Is Our Life&quot;.

In February 2025, Mirvish Productions announced the production of &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life If You Don&#x27;t Weaken&quot;, a jukebox musical blending Tragically Hip songs with a book by Brian Hill and Ahmed Moneka, to premiere in 2026.

==Legacy and influence==
The Tragically Hip&#x27;s music is extremely popular in their native Canada, and Downie&#x27;s songwriting has been praised for frequently touching upon uniquely Canadian subjects not otherwise covered by mainstream rock groups. In &quot;The National Post&quot;, Dave Kaufman wrote &quot;Although Downie sings of Canada, his songs are by no means patriotic, or no more than in the way that we&#x27;re all influenced by where we&#x27;re from. The band have never been so obvious as to drape themselves in a Canadian flag, but instead, they evoke that shared experience of what it&#x27;s meant for many of us to grow up in Canada.&quot; The band was a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism and worked with them on radio PSAs. After Downie&#x27;s death in 2017, Simon Vozick-Levinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The place of honor that Mr. Downie occupies in Canada&#x27;s national imagination has no parallel in the United States. Imagine Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan and Michael Stipe combined into one sensitive, oblique poet-philosopher, and you’re getting close.&quot;

According to Nielsen BDS, the Tragically Hip were the fourth best-selling Canadian musical artist in Canada between 1996 and 2016, behind only Céline Dion, Shania Twain and Michael Bublé. In that same period of time, &quot;Ahead by a Century&quot; was listed as the 67th most played song on Canadian radio across all formats, while 18 of their songs appeared in a list of the Top 150 most played songs on Canadian rock radio. Reflecting on the band&#x27;s popularity in Canada, Rachel Sklar of &quot;Vox&quot; wrote, &quot;There is a generation of Canadians who, if they went to university, they saw the Hip.&quot;

Despite their high popularity in Canada, the group was never able to cross over into the American rock music scene apart from a small, devoted fan-base centered in border cities like Buffalo, New York. The band notched four entries on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks singles chart in the US; their highest-charting song on the chart being &quot;Courage (for Hugh MacLennan)&quot;, which reached No. 16 in 1993. Downie once complained that the band&#x27;s lack of crossover to the American rock music market had been overexamined, stating &quot;[Interviewers] always ask us about our success or lack of success in the States, which I find absurd. While that is a story of the band, there are so many other stories.&quot; Comedian Rick Mercer remarked that much of the band&#x27;s American fanbase was composed of Canadians living in the United States, and recalled an experience seeing them perform at The Fillmore in San Francisco where the venue was filled with Canadian fans; he wrote, &quot;This was the curse of being the Hip, they would go to the Fillmore, a famous venue, and they would sell out in five minutes. But no Americans could get in. By the time they were like, &#x27;What&#x27;s this happening in this sold-out show with this insane band,&#x27; you couldn&#x27;t get in because every Canadian filled up the space.&quot;

Numerous tribute and cover bands to the Tragically Hip have performed across Canada both before and after the band&#x27;s dissolution. The band&#x27;s music also provides the score for a full-length contemporary ballet, Jean Grand-Maitre&#x27;s &quot;All of Us.&quot;

The band were named as an influence by several Canadian musicians and bands across multiple genres, including Dallas Green, k-os, and Kevin Drew. In 2021, India-born writer Lindsay Pereira wrote about how the band helped him understand Canada and Canadians better.

Downie&#x27;s brother, documentary filmmaker Mike Downie, directed the four-part television documentary series &quot;The Tragically Hip: No Dress Rehearsal&quot;, which premiered in September 2024 at the Toronto International Film Festival and would later be released on Amazon Prime Video for streaming in Canada.

*On January 1, 2017, CBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;The Strombo Show&quot; aired a special episode titled &quot;The Hip 30&quot;, which consisted of Canadian musicians performing live covers of the band&#x27;s songs and sharing their thoughts on the band&#x27;s impact on Canadian culture. Participating artists included Blue Rodeo, Sarah Harmer, Barenaked Ladies, Donovan Woods, Stars, Arkells and Rheostatics. The episode was already planned as a tribute to the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary before Downie&#x27;s cancer diagnosis was announced; several times during the show, host George Stroumboulopoulos reaffirmed that &quot;this is not a eulogy; this is a celebration.&quot;
*On January 28, 2017, the Kingston Frontenacs of the Ontario Hockey League played against the Mississauga Steelheads in a special theme night game, in which the Frontenacs wore specially designed Tragically Hip sweaters.

<text>The National Command Authority (NCA) is a term that was formerly used by the Department of Defense of the United States to refer to the ultimate source of lawful military orders.

The NCA was first alluded to in a 1960 Department of Defense document. It included at least the president of the United States as commander-in-chief and the secretary of defense. The term has no statutory or constitutional basis and was replaced in 2002 in favor of explicitly referring to the president and/or the secretary of defense.

The term also refers to communications with the commanding officers of the Unified Combatant Commands to put U.S. forces into action.

== Authorization of a nuclear or strategic attack ==
Only the president can direct the use of nuclear weapons by U.S. Armed Forces, through plans like OPLAN 8010-12. The president has unilateral authority as commander-in-chief to order that nuclear weapons be used for any reason at any time.

<text>Lembitu (Estonian also: Lembit, died 21 September 1217) was an ancient Estonian king from Sakala County and military leader in the struggle against German crusaders at the beginning of the 13th century. He is the only Estonian pre-Crusade ruler, about whom some biographical information is known (he is mentioned only in the Livonian Chronicle of Henry).

Lembitu, also referred to in Latin as &quot;Lambite&quot;, &quot;Lembito&quot; or &quot;Lembitus&quot;, was first mentioned in chronicles in 1211. Troops led by Lembitu destroyed a troop of missionaries in the historical Estonian county of Sakala (&quot;Sackalia&quot;) and made a raid as far as Pskov, then a town of the Novgorod Republic. In 1215, Lembitu&#x27;s Lehola (&quot;Leal&quot;) stronghold (situated near the present town of Suure-Jaani) was taken by Germans and Lembitu was taken prisoner. He was released in 1217.

Lembitu attempted to unite the Estonians in order to withstand the German conquest. He managed to assemble an army of 6,000 Estonian men from different counties, but was killed in the following Battle of St. Matthew&#x27;s Day in September 1217.

==Title and degree of power==

Lembitu is often considered a king due to several key factors that highlight his leadership and military prowess:

Military Force: Lembitu commanded a significant military force of around 6,000 men, demonstrating his capacity to lead large-scale operations and his influence over a considerable portion of the Estonian populace

Conquest of Pskov: He played a crucial role in the capture of Pskov, the capital of the Pskov principality, which signifies not only military strength but also strategic importance in the region during the conflicts against foreign invaders

Commanding Various Counties: Lembitu served as a general for the combined armies of multiple counties, indicating his authority and recognition among different tribal leaders. This position aligns with the responsibilities typically associated with a king or a supreme military leader
The only written biographical information about Lembit comes from the Livonian Chronicle of Henry, where he is described as &quot;senior&quot; (&quot;elder&quot;) and &quot; &quot;princeps ac senior perfidus Lembitus&quot; (&quot;perfidious prince and elder Lembitu&quot;). In another place the chronicle speaks of &quot; Lambito et Meme, seniores de Sackale &quot; (Lembuto and Meme, elders of Sakala), i.e., Lembitu was not the only elder of the county, thus precluding some interpretations of Lembitu&#x27;s title as &quot;king of Sakala&quot; or &quot;the elder of Sakala&quot;. Modern archaeological evidence suggests that at the time Sakala was probably a kingdom in its own right.

<text>A grain elevator or grain terminal is a facility designed to stockpile or store grain. In the grain trade, the term &quot;grain elevator&quot; also describes a tower containing a bucket elevator or a pneumatic conveyor, which scoops up grain from a lower level and deposits it in a silo or other storage facility.

In most cases, the term &quot;grain elevator&quot; also describes the entire elevator complex, including receiving and testing offices, weighbridges, and storage facilities. It may also mean organizations that operate or control several individual elevators, in different locations. In Australia, the term describes only the lifting mechanism. 

Before the advent of the grain elevator, grain was usually handled in bags rather than in bulk (large quantities of loose grain). The Dart elevator was a major innovation—it was invented by Joseph Dart, a merchant, and Robert Dunbar, an engineer, in 1842, in Buffalo, New York. Using the steam-powered flour mills of Oliver Evans as their model, they invented the marine leg, which scooped loose grain out of the hulls of ships and elevated it to the top of a marine tower.

Early grain elevators and bins were often built of framed or cribbed wood, and were prone to fire. In 1899 Frank H. Peavey &quot;The Elevator King&#x27; along with Charles F. Haglin, invented the modern grain elevator. The first Peavey-Haglin Experimental Concrete Grain Elevator still stands today in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. The Peavey invented elevator was the first cylindrical concrete grain elevator in the world and is now widely used across Canada and the US. 

Grain elevator bins, tanks, and silos are now usually made of steel or reinforced concrete. Bucket elevators are used to lift grain to a distributor or consignor, from which it falls through spouts and/or conveyors and into one or more bins, silos, or tanks in a facility. When desired, silos, bins, and tanks are emptied by gravity flow, sweep augers, and conveyors. As grain is emptied from bins, tanks, and silos, it is conveyed, blended, and weighted into trucks, railroad cars, or barges for shipment.

==Usage and definitions==

In Australian English, the term &quot;grain elevator&quot; is reserved for elevator towers, while a receival and storage building or complex is distinguished by the formal term &quot;receival point&quot; or as a &quot;wheat bin&quot; or &quot;silo&quot;. Large-scale grain receival, storage, and logistics operations are known in Australia as bulk handling.

In Canada, the term &quot;grain elevator&quot; is used to refer to a place where farmers sell grain into the global grain distribution system, and/or a place where the grain is moved into rail cars or ocean-going ships for transport. Specifically, several types of grain elevators are defined under Canadian law, in the &quot;Canadian Grain Act&quot;, section 2.
* Primary elevators (called &quot;country elevators&quot; before 1971) receive grain directly from producers for storage, forwarding, or both.
* Process elevators (called &quot;mill elevators&quot; before 1971) receive and store grain for direct manufacture or processing into other products.
* Terminal elevators receive grain on or after official inspection and weighing and clean, store, and treat grain before moving it forward.
* Transfer elevators (including &quot;Eastern elevators&quot; from the pre-1971 classification) transfer grain that has been officially inspected and weighed at another elevator. In the Eastern Division, transfer elevators also receive, clean, and store eastern or foreign grain.

==History==

Both necessity and the prospect of making money gave birth to the steam-powered grain elevator in Buffalo, New York, in 1843. Due to the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, Buffalo enjoyed a unique position in American geography. It stood at the intersection of two great all-water routes; one extended from New York Harbor, up the Hudson River to Albany, and beyond it, the Port of Buffalo; the other comprised the Great Lakes, which could theoretically take boaters in any direction they wished to go (north to Canada, west to Michigan or Wisconsin, south to Toledo and Cleveland, or east to the Atlantic Ocean). All through the 1830s, Buffalo benefited tremendously from its position. In particular, it was the recipient of most of the increasing quantities of grain (mostly wheat) that was being grown on farms in Ohio and Indiana, and shipped on Lake Erie for trans-shipment to the Erie Canal. If Buffalo had not been there, or when things got backed up there, that grain would have been loaded onto boats at Cincinnati and shipped down the Mississippi River to New Orleans.

By 1842, Buffalo&#x27;s port facilities clearly had become antiquated. They still relied upon techniques that had been in use since the European Middle Ages; work teams of stevedores use block and tackles and their own backs to unload or load each sack of grain that had been stored ashore or in the boat&#x27;s hull. Several days, sometimes even a week, were needed to serve a single grain-laden boat. Grain shipments were going down the Mississippi River, not over the Great Lakes/Erie Canal system.

A merchant named Joseph Dart Jr., is generally credited as being the one who adapted Oliver Evans&#x27; grain elevator (originally a manufacturing device) for use in a commercial framework (the trans-shipment of grain in bulk from lakers to canal boats), but the actual design and construction of the world&#x27;s first steam-powered &quot;grain storage and transfer warehouse&quot; was executed by an engineer named Robert Dunbar. Thanks to the historic Dart&#x27;s Elevator (operational on 1 June 1843), which worked almost seven times faster than its nonmechanized predecessors, Buffalo was able to keep pace with—and thus further stimulate—the rapid growth of American agricultural production in the 1840s and 1850s, but especially after the Civil War, with the coming of the railroads.

The world&#x27;s second and third grain elevators were built in Toledo, Ohio, and Brooklyn, New York, in 1847. These fledgling American cities were connected through an emerging international grain trade of unprecedented proportions. Grain shipments from farms in Ohio were loaded onto ships by elevators at Toledo; these ships were unloaded by elevators at Buffalo that shipped their grain to canal boats (and, later, rail cars), which were unloaded by elevators in Brooklyn, where the grain was either distributed to East Coast flour mills or loaded for further shipment to England, the Netherlands, or Germany. This eastern flow of grain, though, was matched by an equally important flow of people and capital in the opposite direction, that is, from east to west. Because of the money to be made in grain production, and of course, because of the existence of an all-water route to get there, increasing numbers of immigrants in Brooklyn came to Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to become farmers. More farmers meant more prairies turned into farmlands, which in turn meant increased grain production, which of course meant that more grain elevators would have to be built in places such as Toledo, Buffalo, and Brooklyn (and Cleveland, Chicago, and Duluth). Through this loop of productivity set in motion by the invention of the grain elevator, the United States became a major international producer of wheat, corn, and oats.

In the early 20th century, concern arose about monopolistic practices in the grain elevator industry, leading to testimony before the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1906. This led to several grain elevators being burned down in Nebraska, allegedly in protest.
Today, grain elevators are a common sight in the grain-growing areas of the world, such as the North American prairies. Larger terminal elevators are found at distribution centers, such as Chicago and Thunder Bay, Ontario, where grain is sent for processing, or loaded aboard trains or ships to go further afield.

Buffalo, New York, the world&#x27;s largest grain port from the 1850s until the first half of the 20th century, once had the United States&#x27; largest capacity for the storage of grain in over 30 concrete grain elevators located along the inner and outer harbors. While several are still in productive use, many of those that remain are presently idle. In a nascent trend, some of the city&#x27;s inactive capacity has recently come back online, with an ethanol plant started in 2007 using one of the previously mothballed elevators to store corn. In the early 20th century, Buffalo&#x27;s grain elevators inspired modernist architects such as Le Corbusier, who exclaimed, &quot;The first fruits of the new age!&quot; when he first saw them. Buffalo&#x27;s grain elevators have been documented for the Historic American Engineering Record and added to the National Register of Historic Places. Currently, Enid, Oklahoma, holds the title of most grain storage capacity in the United States.
In farming communities, each town had one or more small grain elevators that served the local growers. The classic grain elevator was constructed with wooden cribbing and had nine or more larger square or rectangular bins arranged in 3 × 3 or 3 × 4 or 4 × 4 or more patterns. Wooden-cribbed elevators usually had a driveway with truck scale and office on one side, a rail line on the other side, and additional grain-storage annex bins on either side.

In more recent times with improved transportation, centralized and much larger elevators serve many farms. Some of them are quite large. Two elevators in Kansas (one in Hutchinson and one in Wichita) are half a mile long. The loss of the grain elevators from small towns is often considered a great change in their identity, and efforts to preserve them as heritage structures are made. At the same time, many larger grain farms have their own grain-handling facilities for storage and loading onto trucks.
Elevator operators buy grain from farmers, either for cash or at a contracted price, and then sell futures contracts for the same quantity of grain, usually each day. They profit through the narrowing &quot;basis&quot;, that is, the difference between the local cash price, and the futures price, that occurs at certain times of the year.

Before economical truck transportation was available, grain elevator operators sometimes used their purchasing power to control prices. This was especially easy, since farmers often had only one elevator within a reasonable distance of their farms. This led some governments to take over the administration of grain elevators. An example of this is the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. For the same reason, many elevators were purchased by cooperatives.

A recent problem with grain elevators is the need to provide separate storage for ordinary and genetically modified grain to reduce the risk of accidental mixing of the two.

In the past, grain elevators sometimes experienced silo explosions. Fine powder from the millions of grains passing through the facility would accumulate and mix with the oxygen in the air. A spark could spread from one floating particle to the other, creating a chain reaction that would destroy the entire structure. (This dispersed-fuel explosion is the mechanism behind fuel-air bombs.) To prevent this, elevators have very rigorous rules against smoking or any other open flame. Many elevators also have various devices installed to maximize ventilation, safeguards against overheating in belt conveyors, legs, bearings, and explosion-proof electrical devices such as electric motors, switches, and lighting.
Grain elevators in small Canadian communities often had the name of the community painted on two sides of the elevator in large block letters, with the name of the elevator operator emblazoned on the other two sides. This made identification of the community easier for rail operators (and incidentally, for lost drivers and pilots). The old community name often remained on an elevator long after the town had either disappeared or been amalgamated into another community; the grain elevator at Ellerslie, Alberta, remained marked with its old community name until it was demolished, which took place more than 20 years after the village had been annexed by Edmonton.

One of the major historical trends in the grain trade has been the closure of many smaller elevators and the consolidation of the grain trade to fewer places and among fewer companies. For example, in 1961, 1,642 &quot;country elevators&quot; (the smallest type) were in Alberta, holding of grain. By 2010, only 79 &quot;primary elevators&quot; (as they are now known) remained, holding .
Despite this consolidation, overall storage capacity has increased in many places. In 2017, the United States had of storage capacity, a growth of 25% over the previous decade.

==Elevator Alley==

The city of Buffalo is not only the birthplace of the modern grain elevator, but also has the world&#x27;s largest number of extant examples. A number of the city&#x27;s historic elevators are clustered along &quot;Elevator Alley&quot;, a narrow stretch of the Buffalo River immediately adjacent to the harbor. The alley runs under Ohio Street and along Childs Street in the city&#x27;s First Ward neighborhood.

==Elevator row==
In Canada, the term &quot;elevator row&quot; refers to a row of four or more wood-crib prairie grain elevators.

In the early pioneer days of Western Canada&#x27;s prairie towns, when a good farming spot was settled, many people wanted to make money by building their own grain elevators. This brought in droves of private grain companies. Towns boasted dozens of elevator companies, which all stood in a row along the railway tracks. If a town were lucky enough to have two railways, it was to be known as the next Montreal. Many elevator rows had two or more elevators of the same company. Small towns bragged of their large elevator rows in promotional pamphlets to attract settlers. With so much competition in the 1920s, consolidation began almost immediately, and many small companies were merged or absorbed into larger companies.

In the mid-1990s, with the cost of grain so low, many private elevator companies once again had to merge, this time causing thousands of &quot;prairie sentinels&quot; to be torn down. Because so many grain elevators have been torn down, Canada has only two surviving elevator rows; one located in Inglis, Manitoba, and the other in Warner, Alberta. The Inglis Grain Elevators National Historic Site has been protected as a National Historic Sites of Canada. The Warner elevator row is, as of 2019, not designated a historic site, and is still in use as commercial grain elevators.

==Elevator companies==
===Australia===
* ABB Grain was founded as a mutual company, the Australian Barley Board, in 1939, by barley growers in South Australia and Victoria; after demutualization, it was acquired by Viterra (see below) in 2009; Australian Bulk Alliance, a joint venture between ABB and Sumitomo, operates facilities in some areas.
* CBH Group, a co-operative company, was established by grain growers in Western Australia, in 1933.
* GrainCorp was established by the government of New South Wales in 1917, as Government Grain Elevator, and was privatized in 1992.

==Elevator explosions==

Given a large enough suspension of combustible flour or grain dust in the air, a significant explosion can occur. The 1878 explosion of the Washburn &quot;A&quot; Mill in Minneapolis, Minnesota, killed 18, leveled two nearby mills, damaged many others, and caused a destructive fire that gutted much of the nearby milling district. (The Washburn &quot;A&quot; mill was later rebuilt and continued to be used until 1965.) Another example occurred in 1998, when the DeBruce grain elevator in Wichita, Kansas, exploded and killed seven people. An explosion on October 29, 2011, at the Bartlett Grain Company in Atchison, Kansas, killed six people. Two more men received severe burns, but the remaining four were not hurt.

Almost any finely divided organic substance becomes an explosive material when dispersed as an air suspension; hence, a very fine flour is dangerously explosive in air suspension. This poses a significant risk when milling grain to produce flour, so mills go to great lengths to remove sources of sparks. These measures include carefully sifting the grain before it is milled or ground to remove stones, which could strike sparks from the millstones, and the use of magnets to remove metallic debris able to strike sparks.

The earliest recorded flour explosion took place in an Italian mill in 1785, but many have occurred since. These two references give numbers of recorded flour and dust explosions in the United States in 1994: and 1997 In the ten-year period up to and including 1997, there were 129 explosions.

==Media==
Canadian Prairie grain elevators were the subjects of the National Film Board of Canada documentaries &quot;Grain Elevator&quot; and &quot;Death of a Skyline&quot;.

During the sixth season of the History Channel series &quot;Ax Men&quot;, one of the featured crews takes on the job of dismantling the Globe Elevator in Wisconsin. This structure was the largest grain-storage facility in the world when it was built in the 1880s.

<text>The Battle of Morgarten took place on 15 November 1315, when troops of Schwyz, supported by their allies of Uri and Unterwalden, ambushed an Austrian army under the command of Leopold I, Duke of Austria on the shores of Lake Ägeri, in the territory of Schwyz.

After a brief close-quarters battle, the Austrian army was routed, with numerous slain or drowned. The Swiss victory consolidated the League of the Three Forest Cantons, which formed the core of the Old Swiss Confederacy.

== Background ==

Toward the end of the 13th century the House of Habsburg coveted the area around the Gotthard Pass, as it offered the shortest passage to Italy. However, the Confederates of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden, which had formalized the Swiss Confederacy in 1291, held imperial freedom letters from former Habsburg emperors granting them local within the empire. In 1314 tensions between the Habsburgs and Confederates heightened when Duke Louis IV of Bavaria (who would become Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor) and Frederick the Handsome, a Habsburg prince, each claimed the crown of the Holy Roman Emperor.

The Confederates supported Louis IV because they feared the Habsburgs would annex their lands (which they had tried to do in the late 13th century). War broke out after the Confederates of Schwyz raided the Habsburg-protected Einsiedeln Abbey.
The conflict with Einsiedeln had begun when settlers moved from Schwyz into unused parts of the territories claimed by Einsiedeln. The settlers cleared the primal forest and established farms or pastures. The abbot of Einsiedeln carried his complaint to the bishop of Constance, who moved to excommunicate Schwyz.
As revenge, men of Schwyz under the leadership of Werner Stauffacher raided Einsiedeln abbey on the night of 6 January 1314. They plundered the monastery, desecrated the church, and took several monks as hostages. The abbot managed to escape to Pfäffikon, from where he alerted the bishop. The bishop reacted by including Uri and Unterwalden in the excommunication.

== Battle ==

Frederick&#x27;s brother, Habsburg duke Leopold of Austria, led a large army to crush the rebellious Confederates. 
Johannes von Winterthur&#x27;s chronicle of the battle puts the Habsburg forces at 20,000, although that number is likely an exaggeration.
A 19th century account by Rudolf Hanhart states that there were 9,000 men in the Habsburg army.
Historian Hans Delbrück estimated in 1907 that the Habsburg army consisted of only 2,000–3,000 men, but that these were mainly well-trained and -equipped knights. Delbrück&#x27;s view is shared by Kelly DeVries.

The Confederates of Schwyz were supported by the Confederates of Uri and Unterwalden. 
The size of the Confederate force is unknown, with estimates ranging from 1,500 to around 3,000-4,000. 
Regardless of numerical considerations, the main contrast between the two forces was that a well-equipped and trained medieval army was meeting an improvised militia of farmers and herdsmen.

According to the 15th-century Swiss chronicles, Leopold upon reaching Ägeri debated with his nobles how to best invade Schwyz, with several possible routes under consideration. After the decision was taken to take the direct approach, marching to Sattel from the north, Leopold is said to have asked his court jester, one Cuoni von Stocken, for his opinion. The fool expressed misgivings, quipping that &quot;you have all deliberated on how to reach that land, but none of you deliberated how you will get out again&quot;.

In order to hide his intentions to attack from the north, Leopold sent a number of smaller detachments in order to create diversions. One such attack was sent to Arth, attacking from the northwest, one from Entlebuch attacking Unterwalden from the north, one from Lucerne attacking Schwyz from the west across Lake Lucerne, and one under the command of count Otto von Strassberg was sent across Brünig Pass to Obwalden. When news of the Habsburg defeat at Morgarten reached von Strassberg, he decided to turn back. He was reportedly injured on the retreat and died from his wounds soon after.

According to Konrad Justinger&#x27;s chronicle, written c. 1430, the people of Schwyz were warned by their neighbours, the lords of Hünenberg.
The warning is said to have been delivered by the means of arrows fletched with parchment, with the message written on the fletching, &quot;beware near Morgarten&quot; (&quot;hütend üch am morgarten&quot;), thus indicating the route chosen by Leopold for entering Schwyz.

Upon receiving this warning, the men of Schwyz, with the support of 600 men of Uri and Unterwalden, hurried to Sattel to intercept the enemy. Between Lake Ägerisee and Sattel, where a small path led between a steep slope and a swamp, they prepared an ambush.
The marching army would have been stretched out in a column of some 2 km along the path when the vanguard encountered a roadblock near Schafstetten.
The Confederates attacked the column, frightening the horses by throwing rocks from above and engaging the mounted knights with halberds.

About 1,500 men were said to have been killed in the attack; according to Johannes von Winterthur (writing ca. 1340), this number does not include those drowned in the lake.
According to Karl von Elgger, the Confederates, unfamiliar with the customs of battles between knights, brutally butchered retreating troops and everyone unable to flee. He records that some infantry preferred to drown themselves in the lake rather than face the brutality of the Swiss.

The earliest mentions of the battle, in chronicles of the 14th century, identify it as having taken place in the land of Schwyz, or Schwyz and Uri (Peter of Zittau has &quot;Sweicz et Uherach&quot;).
The name of &quot;Morgarten&quot; is recorded by Konrad Justinger in the context of the written warning attached to arrows. The toponym &quot;Morgarten&quot; originally refers to an alpine pasture near (now &quot;Chli Morgarten&quot;). The name translates to &quot;pig corral&quot;, &quot;enclosure for swine&quot;.
The entire passage between Lake Ägeri and Sattel is now known as Morgarten, but this is in reference to the battle.

==Use of halberds==
There is some evidence to suggest that the attack at Morgarten involved the first recorded use of halberds against knights, the weapon that would become iconic of the Old Swiss Confederacy.

Matthias of Neuenburg writing in Latin around 1350 uses the term &quot;jesa&quot; to describe a type of polearm used by the Confederates; this has been interpreted as referencing an early form of the halberd.
Konrad Justinger, writing in German in c. 1430, cites the use of halberds explicitly: &quot;the Swiss held in their hands certain most terrible murder weapons, known in the vernacular as &quot;helnbarten&quot;, by means of which even the best armed opponents were cut apart as with a razor blade, and hacked to pieces: this was no &#x27;battle&#x27;, but, for the reasons mentioned, so to speak a mere butchering of the men of duke Leopold by those mountain dwellers, as with a herd led to slaughter&quot;.

In the assessment of John Guilmartin, writing for &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (2015, s.v. &quot;Military technology&quot;, section &quot;The infantry revolution, c. 1200–1500&quot;):
==Aftermath==
Within a month of the battle, in December 1315, the Confederates renewed the oath of alliance made in 1291, initiating a period of growth within the Confederacy. In March 1316 Emperor Louis IV confirmed the rights and privileges of the Forest Cantons. However, Leopold prepared another attack against the Confederacy. In response, Schwyz attacked some of the Habsburg lands and Unterwalden marched into the Bernese Oberland. Neither side was able to prevail against the other, and in 1318 the isolated Forest Cantons negotiated a ten-month truce with the Habsburgs, which was extended several times. By 1323 the Forest Cantons had made alliances with Bern, and Schwyz had signed an alliance with Glarus for protection from the Habsburgs. Within 40 years cities including Lucerne, Zug and Zürich had also joined the Confederacy. The Confederate victory gave them virtual autonomy and, for a time, a peace with the Habsburgs that lasted until the Battle of Sempach in 1386.

==Commemoration==
As the first military success of the Confederacy, Morgarten became an important staple of 
Swiss patriotism in the early modern period.
Records of formal commemorations of the battle go back to the 14th century; 
Johannes von Winterthur in the 1340s records the decision of Schwyz to hold a yearly commemoration. The existence of a chapel at the site of the battle is recorded in 1501.
Writing in 1530, Joachim Vadian suggests that the first such chapel may have been built immediately after the battle, with the proceeds from the spoils. The modern chapel dates to 1604.
In 1891, in the context of the 600-years anniversary of the Confederacy, plans were made to erect a new memorial at the site of battle.
There was some dispute as to the appropriate location (not least because the &quot;battle&quot; was an attack on a marching column stretched out for some 2 kilometres), with both the cantons of Schwyz and of Zug claiming the site of the battle.
A monument was eventually inaugurated in 1908 at the southern shore of Lake Ägeri, in the village of &quot;Hauptsee&quot;, in the canton of Zug. On this occasion, the village was renamed to &quot;Morgarten&quot; (part of Oberägeri municipality). The authorities of Schwyz refused to acknowledge a site of the battle outside of their territory and did not send any official representation to the monument&#x27;s inauguration ceremony.

Since 1912, a yearly target shooting event has been held on the day of the battle in the vicinity of the monument, the &quot;Morgartenschiessen&quot;. The competition is over the distance of 300m. In addition, a pistol competition over a distance of 50m was introduced in 1957, taking place in the territory of Schwyz, near the battle chapel.

A large celebration for the 600-year anniversary of the battle was organised in 1915, held in two locations at the chapel and the monument.
In the context of the 650-year anniversary in 1965, efforts were made to preserve the site of the battle. Money was raised for the canton of Schwyz to buy up private land in the area.
Felicia Hemans&#x27;s poem &quot;Song of The Battle of Morgarten&quot; was published in The Edinburgh Magazine in 1822.

<text>Jeremiah McLain Rusk (June 17, 1830November 21, 1893) was an American Republican politician. He was the second United States secretary of agriculture (1889–1893) and the 15th governor of Wisconsin (1882–1889), and served three terms in the United States House of Representatives (1871–1877), representing northwest Wisconsin. He also served as a Union Army officer during the American Civil War, served one term in the Wisconsin State Assembly (1862), and was the last Bank Comptroller of Wisconsin (1866–1870) before the office was abolished.

==Biography==
Rusk was born in Malta, Ohio, the younger brother of Allen Rusk. He was a member of the Republican Party. He began as a planter, then turned to innkeeping and finally to banking before the American Civil War.

Rusk started his service with the Union Army during Civil War as major of the 25th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment on August 14, 1862. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on September 16, 1863. He took command of the regiment on July 22, 1864, when Colonel Milton Montgomery was wounded and captured at Decatur, Georgia during the Battle of Atlanta. He continued in command after Montgomery was exchanged because Montgomery was given command of the brigade to which the 25th Wisconsin Infantry was assigned. Rusk was wounded at Salkehatchie River, Georgia on January 20, 1865. Rusk was mustered out of the volunteers on June 7, 1865. He received an appointment as brevet colonel to rank from March 13, 1865. On February 24, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Rusk for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on April 10, 1866.

After the Civil War, he became a congressman in the United States House of Representatives. He was elected to the Forty-second United States Congress as the representative of Wisconsin&#x27;s 6th congressional district serving from March 4, 1871, to March 3, 1873. For the Forty-third Congress he redistricted and was elected as representative of Wisconsin&#x27;s newly created 7th District. He was reelected to the Forty-fourth Congress as well serving from March 4, 1873, to March 3, 1877. While in congress, he was chairman of Committee on Invalid Pensions (Forty-third congress). After his terms in congress he ran as a Republican for Governor of Wisconsin, an election he won. His most noted act during his governorship was when he sent the National Guard into Milwaukee to keep the peace during the May Day Labor Strikes of 1886. The strikers had shut down every business in the city except the North Chicago Rolling Mills in Bay View. The guardsmen&#x27;s orders were that, if the strikers were to enter the Mills, they should shoot to kill. But when the captain received the order it had a different meaning: he ordered his men to pick out a man and shoot to kill when the order was given. This led to the Bay View Tragedy, in which a number of workers were killed; Governor Rusk took most of the blame.

In 1889, after the end of his third term as governor, he accepted the new cabinet position of secretary of agriculture in the Benjamin Harrison administration. He lived, died and was buried in Viroqua, Wisconsin. Rusk County, Wisconsin was named after Rusk. It was originally Gates County but changed its name in 1905.

==Personal life and legacy==
Jeremiah McLain Rusk was the youngest of seven children born to Daniel Rusk and his wife Jane (&quot;&quot; Faulkner). Rusk&#x27;s elder brother Allen Rusk also served in the Wisconsin State Assembly and in the Union Army during the Civil War.

Jeremiah McLain Rusk married twice. His first wife was Mary Martin, who he married in 1849. They had two children together before her death in 1856. Later that year, Rusk married Elizabeth Marie &quot;Berthe&quot; Johnson, with whom he had four more children, though one died young. His second wife survived him.

His eldest son was Lycurgus James Rusk, was a lawyer and worked as private secretary to his father; he also went on to serve in the Wisconsin State Assembly and was a prominent member of the Wisconsin bar.

The house he bought and lived in while Governor of Wisconsin, now known as the Old Executive Mansion, was used by the state as the official residence of the Governor for several decades and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="255179" wikidata="Q370198" url="?curid=255179" title="William D. Hoard">
<text>William Dempster Hoard (October 10, 1836November 22, 1918) was an American politician, newspaper publisher, and agriculture advocate who served as the 16th governor of Wisconsin from 1889 to 1891. Called the &quot;father of modern dairying&quot;, Hoard&#x27;s advocacy for scientific agriculture and the expansion of dairy farming has been credited with changing Wisconsin&#x27;s agricultural economy. He promoted the use of silos and alfalfa for cattle feed, testing for bovine tuberculosis, and raising particular breeds of cattle for milk or meat in his magazine &quot;Hoard&#x27;s Dairyman&quot;. His work with the Wisconsin Dairymen&#x27;s Association led to the export of Wisconsin dairy products to the East Coast and they earned national renown.

As editor of his newspaper, the &quot;Jefferson County Union&quot;, Hoard defied trends of the time for small newspapers by expanding the coverage area of the paper and including a strongly voiced editorial page, which he used to advocate for improved farming practices and dairy farming. As governor of Wisconsin, Hoard established the Dairy and Food Commission—one of the first food inspection agencies in the United States—and passed a controversial, short-lived compulsory education law that required all students in the state to be taught in English as part of the Americanization process for immigrants.

==Early life and education==
William D. Hoard was born on October 10, 1836, in Munnsville, New York, to William Bradford Hoard and Sarah Katherine White Hoard. He was the eldest of four children. His father was a blacksmith and itinerant Methodist minister who preached to the Oneida people. Hoard was educated in a one-room log schoolhouse built by his grandfather, Enos, who also maintained a library. The library and encouragement from Hoard&#x27;s mother led to a passion for reading. Enos brought Hoard while purchasing dairy cattle and educated him on dairy farming as a child. When he was 16, Hoard left school to work as a farmhand for Waterman Simons, a neighboring dairy farmer from whom Hoard learned how to make cheese and butter. While working as a farmhand, Hoard witnessed the depletion of New York soil by the growing of wheat and other crops, which led to the adoption of dairy farming in the state. During this time, he managed a 50-cow herd and read technical journals on farming. 

In 1857, Hoard moved to Oak Grove, Wisconsin, and studied to become a Methodist minister. Ideological conflict with church leadership led him to cease his studies. For the next three years, Hoard found employment chopping wood and giving singing lessons. In 1860, he married Agnes Elizabeth Bragg and moved in with her parents in Lake Mills, Wisconsin. The couple had three children: Halbert Louis, Arthur Ralph, and Frank Ward.

After the outbreak of the American Civil War, Hoard—an admirer of Abraham Lincoln—enlisted in the Union Army. He was assigned to the 4th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment as a fife player and participated in the capture of New Orleans. Hoard became ill while pursuing Confederate soldiers and was discharged. He returned to his parents&#x27; farm in New York; after fully recovering, he re-enlisted in the Union Army and was assigned to Battery A of the 1st New York Light Artillery Battalion, serving until the end of the war in 1865. After the war, Hoard moved to Columbus, Wisconsin, and attempted to grow hops. The price of the crop collapsed, and Hoard gave up hop farming.

==Career==
===Publishing and advocacy===
====&quot;Jefferson County Union&quot; and &quot;Hoard&#x27;s Dairyman&quot;====
Hoard founded a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Jefferson County Union&quot;, in Lake Mills in 1870. Against the trends of the time, Hoard expanded his paper&#x27;s coverage to include surrounding areas. Early editions of the &quot;Union&quot; were printed under contract with the &quot;Watertown Republican&quot;, for which Hoard had written before founding his own newspaper. Hoard moved the &quot;Union&quot; to Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, in 1873 and by 1883 he had constructed a new building that included a printing press.

Hoard included an editorial page in the &quot;Union&quot;, a rarity for small newspapers of the time. He used these columns to write about a variety of topics, most prominently the promotion of scientific agricultural practices, and started a dairy farming-specific column in 1872. Readers received these editorials with skepticism due to Hoard&#x27;s lack of experience in Wisconsin agriculture, and referred to him as a theorist and a &quot;book farmer&quot;. Hoard continued to write agriculture columns and, after encouragement from his son Arthur and &quot;Whitewater Register&quot; publisher Ed E. Coe, founded &quot;Hoard&#x27;s Dairyman&quot; in 1885 as a folio supplement to the &quot;Union&quot;.

The &quot;Dairyman&quot; was initially financially supported by its parent newspaper. By 1889, it had become a separate magazine that focused primarily on dairy farming. As was commonplace with dairy trade publications at the time, Hoard mixed reporting and advertising in the &quot;Dairyman&quot;, juxtaposing advertisements with articles promoting the advertised technique or technology. Hoard used the publication to advocate for agricultural and dairy manufacturing practices. These included the testing of herds for bovine tuberculosis, slaughtering infected animals, and providing recompense for farmers who culled their herds; the growth and use of alfalfa as cattle feed, the use of particular breeds of cattle for milking or meat, the use of the Babcock test to analyze the butterfat content of milk, sanitization of milk bottles used in city delivery, the humane treatment of cattle, the formation of agricultural cooperatives to compete with corporations, and the adoption of silos to store cattle feed. Hoard purchased Hoard&#x27;s Dairyman Farm in 1899, using it to test agricultural theories. By 1924, &quot;Hoard&#x27;s Dairyman&quot; had a print circulation of 75,000 and readers in Japan, Australia, and England. It is considered the first agriculture publication to have a nationwide readership in the United States.

====Trade associations and lobbying====
Hoard founded the Jefferson County Dairymen&#x27;s Association in 1871 and cofounded the Wisconsin Dairymen&#x27;s Association (WDA) with Chester Hazen, Stephen Favill, Walter S. Greene, H.C. Drake, J.G. Hull, M.S. Barrett, D.E. Smith, and H.F. Dousman in 1872. At its founding, Hazen declared the WDA had three goals: to openly discuss dairy problems, eliminate a surplus of cheese and reduce freight rates for rail transport of dairy products, and market to dealers from the East Coast. The WDA sent Hoard to Chicago in 1874 to barter with railroads to secure better prices and refrigerated railcars for the transport of cheese from Wisconsin to the East Coast. His efforts were successful; rates were reduced to one cent per pound. Cheese production in Wisconsin increased rapidly following the rate reduction. In 1876, the American Dairymen&#x27;s Association invited the WDA to show its products at the Centennial Exhibition. Hoard felt slighted by the group that had ignored him for three years and advocated against going under the auspices of the national association; the other members agreed, rejecting the proposal and ultimately setting up exhibits themselves. Wisconsin dairy products won 20 awards and earned national renown.

Through the Wisconsin Dairymen&#x27;s Association, Hoard and other founders successfully lobbied for the creation of agriculture-related regulations and educational institutions, including legislation to ban skim and filled cheese, the establishment of farmers&#x27; institutes and the College of Agriculture at the University of Wisconsin. In 1890, the group successfully campaigned for the establishment of the first dairy school in the U.S., which taught students to make butter and cheese. 

Hoard opposed the sale of adulterated dairy products and oleomargarine, which became popular in the late 1800s. Oleomargarine, made by emulsifying lard with milk and water, was often dyed yellow to give it the appearance of butter and was sold as such. The cost of producing oleomargarine was much lower than that of butter and dairy farmers viewed it as a threat to their livelihoods. In 1894, Hoard founded the National Dairy Union and campaigned for an additional tax to be placed on the sale of dyed oleomargarine, which he viewed as a fraudulent product. Hoard often testified before Congress about the fraudulent nature of oleomargarine between 1898 and 1902, and helped secure the passage of the Oleomargarine Act of 1902, which added an additional 10-cent tax on the sale of colored oleomargarine and briefly caused a decline in its production.

===Political career===
====Early career====
In 1870, Hoard was appointed a deputy U.S. Marshal and assigned to be a census taker in Lake Mills and the surrounding area. While taking the census, Hoard met a family of German immigrants who could not speak English and had been tricked out of a large sum of money by English-speaking confidence tricksters. The experience influenced Hoard&#x27;s opinions on education when he became governor. In 1872, Hoard was named the sergeant-at-arms for the Wisconsin Senate.

====Governor of Wisconsin====
By 1888, Hoard had become a popular speaker, lecturing on agricultural topics throughout Wisconsin. The Republican gubernatorial candidate had not yet been decided. Horace Rublee put Hoard&#x27;s name forth as a candidate in an anonymous &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; article in March 1888. He received strong support from farmers throughout the state and was the party&#x27;s unanimous nominee for governor at the state Republican convention in September 1888. Robert M. La Follette lent Hoard his poll lists and advisers for his gubernatorial campaign. Hoard was elected as the 16th governor of Wisconsin in the election of 1888, defeating Democratic candidate James Morgan. He was inaugurated in 1889 and served a single two-year term. His administration passed a controversial compulsory education law that mandated schools educate their pupils in English. It also created the Dairy and Food Commission to oversee dairy production in the state and enforce bans on skim and filled cheese as well as other adulterated dairy products. It was one of the first food inspection agencies in the United States. 

=====Bennett Law=====
The first legislation Hoard signed was the Bennett Law. It passed in April 1889 and mandated children in the state aged 7–14 attend school in their district of residence for at least 12 weeks per year and receive instruction in English. The latter provision was added by Hoard, who advocated for the Americanization of immigrants in the state and viewed the English-only movement as an important step in the process.

By 1890, approximately 70 percent of the Wisconsin population were immigrants or had at least one immigrant parent; many of that group had German ancestry. German Lutherans and German Catholics in Wisconsin, who combined American patriotism with a strong ethnic pride and affection for speaking the German language, felt the law attacked the independence of their church communities and parochial schools, many of which primarily taught their courses in German. Hoard, on the other hand, felt church communities focused more on growing their congregations through these schools than on fostering American citizenship. He came to see the law as a matter of the separation of church and state and necessary to protect public schools. Opponents of the law characterized it as paternalistic and Hoard as prejudiced against German-Americans.

In March 1890, the three Catholic bishops of Wisconsin published a manifesto opposing the law and three months later, the Wisconsin, Missouri, and Evangelical synods similarly denounced it. German-language publications throughout the state advocated for the law&#x27;s repeal and called for Catholics and Lutherans to do the same. Scandinavian immigrants in the state supported the repeal of the law based on its clause requiring students be taught in their district of residence; Scandinavian communities had fewer parochial schools than their German counterparts and were convinced by opponents of the law that it would prevent their children attending them. The Bennett Law became the primary issue of the election of 1890, though economic pressures attributed to the McKinley Tariff also played a significant role. Hoard, a political novice, refused to compromise on the law, leading previously Republican-supporting German voters to turn against the party. Democrats won a supermajority in the Wisconsin Legislature and eight of nine available seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Hoard was defeated by George Wilbur Peck for the governorship. The Bennett Law was repealed in February 1891, the first act of the new legislature. Historian Louise Phelps Kellogg noted the law&#x27;s purpose of increasing English literacy in immigrant communities was still achieved; parochial schools sought to prove the legislation was not needed by introducing more English-language instruction in their classrooms.

====Post-governorship====
Following his defeat in the election of 1890, Hoard returned to his work with the &quot;Union&quot; and &quot;Dairyman&quot;, using his publications to support Robert M. La Follette. Hoard was uneasy about La Follette&#x27;s more radical positions and began to distance himself from the progressive wing of the party, completely disassociating by the end of the 1905 special session of the Wisconsin Legislature, citing La Follette&#x27;s dictatorial behavior and Hoard&#x27;s inability to reconcile elements of the platform that provided more social services with his own ideals. In 1907, Hoard was named to the University of Wisconsin&#x27;s Board of Regents, where he helped transport a dairy herd to the campus in Madison and arrange the construction of the Livestock Pavilion. He resigned from the Board in 1911, citing efforts by Governor Francis E. McGovern to fill it with La Follette loyalists.

==Legacy==
Hoard died on November 22, 1918, and was buried in Fort Atkinson. He has been credited with changing the agricultural economy of Wisconsin from the growth of wheat to the raising of dairy cattle and production of dairy products, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called him &quot;the father of modern dairying&quot;. Wisconsin governor Emanuel L. Philipp assembled a committee that named Hoard the state&#x27;s &quot;Most Distinguished Citizen&quot; in 1915. Gutzon Borglum made a statue of Hoard, which was placed on Henry Mall in front of the College of Agriculture on the University of Wisconsin campus in 1922. In 2010, the Wisconsin Legislature made his birthday, October 10, a state holiday. Hoard&#x27;s Dairyman Farm is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is considered the most famous dairy farm in the world.

<doc id="255180" wikidata="Q2053737" url="?curid=255180" title="Hankyu Kyoto Main Line">
<text>The is a railway line in Japan operated by the private railway operator Hankyu Railway. It connects Osaka-umeda Station in Osaka and Kyoto-kawaramachi Station in Kyoto.

==Definition==
The Kyoto Main Line is often called the for short, and in a broader sense its two branch lines, the Senri Line and the Arashiyama Line, are included to the Kyoto Line by historical, geographical and structural reasons. The other two sections of Hankyu, the Kobe Line and the Takarazuka Line are called the as a whole.

Officially, the Kyoto Main Line is from Jūsō to Kyoto-kawaramachi, however, all trains run beyond Jūsō to Osaka-umeda terminal, using the eastern tracks of the section exclusively. Hankyu treats the Kyoto Main Line in the same way as the passengers do, i.e. as the line between Osaka-umeda and Kyoto-kawaramachi (except for special circumstances such as governmental procedures).

==History==

The Kyoto Main Line was constructed in the following phases:
* 1 April 1, 1921: Jūsō – Awaji (by Kita-Osaka Electric Railway)
* 16 January 1928: Awaji – Takatsuki-machi (present-day Takatsuki-shi) (by Shin-Keihan Railway)
* 1 November 1928: Takatsuki-machi – Kyoto-Saiin (present-day Saiin) (by Shin-Keihan Railway)
* 31 March 1931: Saiin – Keihan-Kyoto (present-day Ōmiya) (by Keihan Electric Railway)
* 18 February 1959: The additional double tracks of the Takarazuka Main Line between Umeda (present-day Osaka-umeda) and Jūso now used exclusively by the Kyoto Main Line
* 17 June 1963: Ōmiya – Kawaramachi (now Kyoto-kawaramachi)

Prior to the merger of Hankyu Railway (then Hanshin Kyūkō Railway) and Keihan Electric Railway in 1943, the line and its branches were owned by the latter and called the Shin-Keihan (New Keihan) Line. In the breakup of the merger in 1949, the line was not ceded to Keihan and became a competitor of the Keihan Main Line.

Construction has been in progress since 2012 to elevate a section of track from Sōzenji Station to Kami-Shinjō Station including the junction with the Senri Line at Awaji Station. Originally projected for a 2020 completion, various delays have pushed back the start of operations on the new tracks to 2031.

Station numbering was introduced to all Hankyu stations on 21 December 2013.

===Proposed connecting line===
A loop line from Juso to Awaji via Shin-Osaka Station, to provide a direct connection to the Shinkansen has been proposed, but is not currently scheduled for construction.

==Service types==

=== Regular operations ===
As of the December 2022 timetable, trains are classified as follows:

*Local trains stop at all stations on the Kyoto and Senri lines. During the day they operate between Osaka Umeda or Tengachaya and Takatsuki-shi or Kita Senri. During early mornings, rush hours, and late nights, some services are extended to Kyoto-Kawaramachi and other short turn services are operated as well.

* All day except early morning and late nights between Osaka-Umeda and Kyoto-Kawaramachi. Additional services operate through to Tengachaya during weekday rush hours and weekends. Limited stops between Osaka-Umeda and Takatsuki-shi, then all stops to Kyoto-Kawaramachi.

* Late nights from Osaka-Umeda to Kyoto-Kawaramachi and weekday early mornings towards Osaka-Umeda.

* Early mornings and evenings and weekday rush hours, both directions.
* Weekday morning rush hours only, both directions. Car number 5 is for women only.

* Operates during the daytime when other express and limited express services are not running.

*Weekends only, using special 6 car trains.
=== Extra services ===
** Osaka-umeda - Arashiyama: &quot;
**Kyoto-kawaramachi - Arashiyama: &quot;
* - Through services to Arashiyama Line, Osaka Metro Sakaisuji Line, Takarazuka Main Line and the Kobe Main Line.
**Kosoku Kobe - Arashiyama: &quot;
**Takarazuka - Arashiyama (via the Imazu Line): &quot;
**Tengachaya - Arashiyama: &quot;&quot; (seasonal service)
*On the Kyoto Main Line, these extra limited express stop at the same stations as the regular Rapid Limited Express.

==Stations==
Legends:

* ● : Trains stop.
* | : Trains pass.

Local trains stop at all stations.

No trains stop at which is served by Local trains on the Kobe Main Line and the Takarazuka Main Line, because of the absence of any platforms on this line. Thus, in operation, Nakatsu Station is not listed on the Kyoto Line.

The starting point of the distances (km) shown is Jūsō Station, which is officially the starting point of the Kyoto Main Line.

<text>Hortus Botanicus is a botanical garden in the Plantage district of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It is one of the world&#x27;s oldest botanical gardens. 

==History==

Amsterdam City Council founded the &quot;Hortus Botanicus&quot; (initially named the &quot;Hortus Medicus&quot;) in 1638 to serve as a herbal garden for doctors and apothecaries, as botanical extracts were the primary treatment for illnesses during this time period. Physicians and pharmacists received their training and took exams there. 

The garden&#x27;s initial collection was amassed during the 17th century through plants and seeds brought back by traders from the Dutch East India Company for use as medicines and potential commercial possibilities. A single coffee plant in &quot;Hortus&quot;&#x27; collection served as the parent for the entire coffee culture in Central and South America.

Likewise, two small potted oil palms that were brought back from Mauritius had produced seeds which were propagated throughout all of Southeast Asia, becoming a major source of revenue in the Dutch East Indies and present-day Indonesia.

In 1646, Johannes Snippendaal was appointed director of the garden. During his tenure, he determined that the collection comprised 796 plant species, most of which were medicinal plants. Many of these plants are still grown at the &quot;Hortus Botanicus&quot; in its Snippendaal Garden, which is commonly referred to as &#x27;the 17th century pharmacopoeia of Amsterdam’.

The hexagonal pavilion dates back to the late 1600s. The entrance gate was built in the early 1700s. The Orangery dates from 1875, and the Palm House and Hugo de Vries Laboratory - both created in Amsterdam School expressionist architecture - date from 1912 and 1915.

Hugo de Vries became the director of the &quot;Hortus Botanicus&quot; between 1885 and 1918, bringing international attention to the garden. The garden&#x27;s governing board directed the construction of the Palm House and laboratory in order to keep the professor there. 

In 1987, the garden almost went bankrupt when the University of Amsterdam suddenly stopped paying its expenses, but a community of individual supporters prevented its closure. The &quot;Hortus Botanicus&quot; is now supported by the Amsterdam City Council.

==Attractions==
&quot;Hortus Botanicus&quot; is a popular attraction for both Dutch and international visitors. The collection is famous for its trees and plants, some of which are endangered. Well-known plants and trees can be found there, like the Persian ironwood tree.

Recent additions to &quot;Hortus&quot; include a large hothouse, which incorporates three different tropical climates. There are also two halls in the garden, which are used for conferences and ceremonies, and a café.

<doc id="255183" wikidata="Q3015265" url="?curid=255183" title="Danny Lopez (boxer)">
<text>Danny Lopez (born July 6, 1952) is an American former professional boxer who was the WBC featherweight champion of the world from November 1976 to February 1980. His nickname was &quot;Little Red&quot;.

Known for his tremendous punching power, in 2003 &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine rated Lopez at number 26 on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Punchers&quot;. In 2010, Lopez was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Background==
Lopez describes himself as having Native American, Mexican, and European-American heritage. He had been moved from one foster home to another, and coming off the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation in Fort Duchesne, Utah, he finally found a home in Southern California. He said that his father was a Mission Indian from Northern California, that his maternal grandmother was three-quarters Ute, and that his maternal grandfather was part Irish. He is also the brother of welterweight contender Ernie Lopez. He is married to Bonnie Lopez and has three sons, Bronson, Jeremy, and Dylan.

==Pro career==
Lopez began boxing professionally on May 27, 1971, knocking out Steve Flajole in one round at Los Angeles. He won his first 21 fights in a row by knockout, in one of the longest knockout win streaks ever. During that streak, all but one of his fights were in Los Angeles, a fact which could be credited for his popularity in the area. The only one of those 21 fights to be held outside Los Angeles took place in Honolulu, where he beat Ushiwakamaru Harada by knockout in three.

On January 17, 1974, Genzo Kurosawa became the first person to go the distance with Lopez, Lopez winning by a ten-round decision. His next fight, a month later, in Mexicali, Mexico, was his first fight abroad. He beat Memo Rodriguez by a knockout in nine rounds.

People in Los Angeles were eager to see Lopez and another up-and-coming Los Angeleno, Bobby Chacon, square off inside a ring. The fight took place on May 24, and Lopez was knocked out in the ninth round in a thrilling fight. In his next fight of note, he lost once again by a knockout in round nine, this time to Shig Furuyama.

After losing to Octavio Gómez to begin 1975, Lopez went on a roll, beginning with a knockout of Chucho Castillo in two rounds. Two more wins, and he was faced with Rubén Olivares, whom he beat by a knockout in seven rounds, after recovering from a first round knockdown himself.

In 1976, he beat Sean O&#x27;Grady by knockout in four, Gómez by knockout in three and Art Hafey by knockout in seven. Finally ranked number one by the WBC, he travelled to Ghana to challenge world Featherweight champion David Kotei in front of an estimated crowd of more than 100,000 Kotei partisans. Lopez became world champion by outpointing Kotei over 15 rounds on November 6. Due to all communication systems having been cut down in Ghana, Lopez could not get his message through to his family; they only learned he was World Champion when they picked him up at the airport one week later.

Lopez won three fights in 1977, retaining the title once, against José Torres by a knockout in round seven.

He and Kotei had a rematch on February 15 of 1978, as part of the undercard where Leon Spinks dethroned Muhammad Ali of the world Heavyweight title. Lopez knocked Kotei out in round six of their rematch, and then he retained the title against Jose DePaula by knockout in round six, and Juan Malvares (on the undercard where Ali regained the title from Spinks) by knockout in two, after recovering from a first round knockdown himself. On October 21, he had a fight with Fel Clemente, against whom he retained the world title with a four-round disqualification in Italy.

By the end of 1978, there was much talk of a &quot;super-fight&quot; against world Jr. Featherweight champion Wilfredo Gómez, but the bout never materialized.

His fight on March 10 of 1979 against Spain&#x27;s Roberto Castañón in Salt Lake City, not only marked the first time he defended his world title in his home-state, but the first time he fought in his home-state as a professional period. He retained the crown with a two-round knockout. On June 17, 1979, at San Antonio, Lopez defeated Mike Ayala with a thrilling 15th-round knockout and retained his WBC Featherweight title for the seventh time; the exciting bout would be recognized by Ring Magazine as its Fight of the Year for 1979.
Lopez went on to defend the title once more that year, knocking out Jose Caba in three rounds.

Lopez&#x27;s reign as world champion came to an end on February 2, 1980, at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix. He met Salvador Sánchez that day, and he lost by knockout in round 13 in a one-sided affair. A rematch was fought on June 21, in Las Vegas, and that time around, Lopez was knocked out in the 14th round. He announced his retirement after that fight.

In 1985, he talked about a comeback, but decided to delay until 1992, when he was 40 years old. He lost that bout via TKO.

His record was 42 wins and 6 losses, with 39 wins by knockout.

In June 2010, Lopez and 12 other boxing personalities were inducted in the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Professional boxing record==

==Life After Boxing==
After his final bout, Lopez was the object of various dedications and was active on the autograph signing circuit. He returned to live in Utah full-time, then moved to Los Angeles, where he worked as a construction worker. Today he lives in Chino Hills, California.

Lopez acted in the 1989 film &quot;Fists of Steel&quot;.

<doc id="255185" wikidata="Q866163" url="?curid=255185" title="Jūsō Station">
<text>is a railway station in Jūsō, Yodogawa-ku, Osaka, Japan, operated by the private railway operator Hankyu Railway. The six-track trunk line from Umeda Station diverges into the three double tracks of the Hankyu Kobe Line, the Hankyu Kyoto Line and the Hankyu Takarazuka Line at this station. The area surrounding the station is an extensive shopping and entertainment district.

==Station layout==
This station has two island platforms and two side platforms serving six tracks on the ground level, enabling to change trains from the Kobe Line for Umeda to the Takarazuka Line for Takarazuka and Minoo on one island platform between Tracks 2 and 3, and from the Takarazuka Line for Umeda to the Kyoto Line for Kyoto (Kawaramachi, Arashiyama) and Kita-Senri on another island platform between Tracks 4 and 5. The platforms are connected by two transfer concourses, one elevated and one underground. The east gate connects directly to platform 6 while the west gate connects directly to platform 1. Several shops and restaurants serving transferring passengers are located inside the station.

There is a returning track in the south of the station between the Kobe Line and the Takarazuka Line. The track is used for the trains for the Kobe Line and the Takarazuka Line running to and from Shojaku Workshop for maintenance, and for seasonal trains running between Kobe or Takarazuka and Arashiyama via the Kobe Line and the Kyoto Line.




==Adjacent stations==







==History==
The station opened on 10 March 1910, as a stop on the Minoo-Arima Railway (today&#x27;s Takarazuka Line). The Kobe Line was added in 1920. In 1921, the North Osaka Electric Railway began service between Juso and Senriyama; this line was acquired by the Keihan Electric Railway and was extended from Awaji Station to both Kyoto and central Osaka. Keihan and Hankyu merged in 1943, bringing all of Juso&#x27;s lines under common ownership. While Keihan was again spun off as a separate company in 1949, Hankyu retained the Juso-Kyoto and Senriyama lines. Juso served as the terminal of the Kyoto Main Line until 1959, when the line was extended to Umeda.

Station numbering was introduced to all Hankyu stations on 21 December 2013 with this station being designated as station number HK-03.

<doc id="255187" wikidata="Q612601" url="?curid=255187" title="The Tragically Hip (EP)">
<text>The Tragically Hip is the first release from Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip, released in 1987.

The EP was produced by Ken Greer of Red Rider, and consists of seven songs on cassette and eight songs on CD.

==Release==
The EP was released in the Kingston area in late 1987, and nationally in January 1988. 

In early 1988 the Hip went on their first cross-Canada tour lasting five weeks. The label&#x27;s initial marketing strategy was to ignore major metropolitan markets such as Toronto, instead focusing on breaking the band in secondary markets and on campus radio; however, within weeks the band had made enough of a name for itself that they were playing Toronto venues like the Horseshoe Tavern by March.

In December 1988 they signed a long-term contract with MCA Records.

==Songs==
It was the only album in the band&#x27;s career on which the band members received separate individual songwriting credits rather than being credited collectively.

The EP was supported by the singles &quot;Small Town Bringdown&quot;, &quot;Highway Girl&quot; and &quot;Last American Exit&quot;.

A live version of &quot;Highway Girl&quot; was released in 1991 as a B-side to &quot;Twist My Arm&quot;, in which Gord Downie tells the story of a suicide pact between a man and his girlfriend. It was a hit on Canadian radio, allowing the song to chart considerably higher than in its original form. The story contains some lines which would later recur as lyrics in the band&#x27;s 1992 single &quot;Locked in the Trunk of a Car&quot;; it ends with Downie exclaiming &quot;Get Mr. Ry Cooder to deliver my eulogy&quot;, which would also recur in &quot;At the Hundredth Meridian&quot;. The album version was also the only song from this EP to be included in the &quot;Yer Favourites&quot; fan-picked compilation of 2005.

==Critical reception==
Mike Degagne of &quot;AllMusic&quot; wrote that the album &quot;is blanketed with a roadside texture that is interesting because it harnesses their music in its rawest and earliest stages. Gord Downie has not yet mastered his poetic rigidity or his soothsayer approach to obscure experiences and events here, as he does on future albums,&quot; but noted that &quot;just because the band hasn&#x27;t yet mastered their musicianship as a whole, doesn&#x27;t mean the album is a total washout, either.&quot; He singled out &quot;Small Town Bringdown&quot; and &quot;Last American Exit&quot; as strong songs, stating that the latter was good enough that it could have been on &quot;Road Apples&quot;.

Evelyn Erskine of the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; wrote that &quot;The Hip&#x27;s influences range from The Doors to The Pretty Things. If there are any flaws, it is that these influences can at times be too transparent. For example, vocalist Gord Downie has fleeting moments where he sounds more like Jim Morrison than he should. But The Hip mixes the tough and the poetic in a manner that is alluring in its hands. The rough guitars that mingle with graceful melodies provide an enticing contrast.&quot;

Greg Burliuk of the band&#x27;s hometown &quot;Kingston Whig-Standard&quot; was the most positive overall, writing that &quot;though it contains only seven songs, rush out and grab this Kingston band&#x27;s recording debut, so that you can say you were among the first to jump on the bandwagon. If the current trend towards rough-edged guitar bands holds, The Hip should find itself streaking towards the top in short order. This mini-album, originally intended simply as a demo, should help that ascent.&quot; He predicted, ultimately correctly, that &quot;Downie is a first-rate singer who I think one day will be considered one of Canada&#x27;s best. So may this band.&quot;

<text>The USA South Athletic Conference (formerly the Dixie Intercollegiate Athletic Conference or the Dixie Conference) is an intercollegiate athletic conference which competes in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III. Member schools are located in North Carolina and Virginia.

==History==

The Dixie Intercollegiate Athletic Conference was founded in 1963 as a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) with the philosophy that participation would be strictly amateur, so no athletic financial aid or scholarships would be awarded by its affiliate institutions. The six charter members were Charlotte College, College of Charleston, Methodist College, North Carolina Wesleyan College, St. Andrews Presbyterian College, and Lynchburg College. In 1973, when the National Collegiate Athletic Association divided into a three-division format, the Dixie Conference left the NAIA and moved into the non-scholarship NCAA Division III.

On June 30, 2003, the conference changed to its name to the USA South Athletic Conference.

During the 2010–11 school year, changes to the membership of the USA South were announced. Three colleges announced plans to join the USA South Conference beginning in the 2012–13 season while one departed the league. Piedmont College, LaGrange College, and Maryville College joined the Great South Athletic Conference on July 1, 2012.

Shenandoah University left the USA South on the above date, to become a full member of the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC), a league in which it held associate membership in several sports.

Christopher Newport University left the USA South after the 2012–13 season to join the Capital Athletic Conference in all sports except for football which remained a USA South affiliate member through the 2015 season.

On May 10, 2012, Covenant College and Huntingdon College announced plans to leave the Great South and join USA South Athletic Conference beginning in the 2013–14 season.

On May 6, 2015, the USA South announced that Agnes Scott College, Salem College, and Wesleyan College would leave the Great South Athletic Conference and join the USA South beginning in the 2016–17 school year. The conference announced the future arrival of three more schools during the 2015–16 school year. First, it announced on December 9, 2015, that Brevard College, transitioning from the NCAA Division II South Atlantic Conference to Division III, would join for 2017–18 and beyond. Then, on May 4, 2016, two more incoming members were announced: Berea College, nearing completion of a transition from the NAIA to Division III, and Pfeiffer University, transitioning from the Division II Conference Carolinas to Division III. Both joined in 2017–18 as well.

On June 27, 2017, Ferrum College, a conference member since 1988, announced that it would leave for the Old Dominion Athletic Conference after the 2017–18 school year.

On December 11, 2019, the USA South announced the addition of Southern Virginia University who joined in the 2021–22 academic year.

Later changes to the USA South membership came on March 8, 2021, when Averett University revealed its intention to leave the USA South and join Ferrum College in the ODAC as a full member in the 2022–23 academic year, and on November 22, when Belhaven University, then a member of the American Southwest Conference, was at first accepted for membership in the conference also for 2022–23.

On February 18, 2022, the USA South Conference presidents announced a restructuring of the conference, resulting in all of its members outside North Carolina and Virginia—Agnes Scott, Berea, Covenant, Huntingdon, LaGrange, Maryville, Piedmont, and Wesleyan—leaving the USA South to form the new Collegiate Conference of the South (CCS) for the 2022-23 academic year. They were joined by incoming member Belhaven. CCS members sponsoring football, men&#x27;s lacrosse, women&#x27;s lacrosse, and women&#x27;s golf remain in the USA South as associate members for those sports.

<text>Robert Marion La Follette Sr. (June 14, 1855June 18, 1925), nicknamed &quot;Fighting Bob&quot;, was an American lawyer and politician. He represented Wisconsin in both chambers of Congress and served as the governor of Wisconsin from 1901 to 1906. A Republican for most of his life, he ran for president of the United States as the nominee of his own Progressive Party in the 1924 U.S. presidential election. Historian John D. Buenker describes La Follette as &quot;the most celebrated figure in Wisconsin history&quot;.

Born and raised in Wisconsin, La Follette won election as the Dane County District Attorney in 1880. Four years later, he was elected to the House of Representatives, where he was friendly with party leaders like William McKinley. After losing his seat in the 1890 election, La Follette regrouped. As a populist, he embraced progressivism and built up a coalition of disaffected Republicans. He sought election as governor in 1896 and 1898 before winning the 1900 gubernatorial election. As governor of Wisconsin, La Follette compiled a progressive record, implementing primary elections and tax reform.

La Follette won re-election in 1902 and 1904, but in 1905 the legislature elected him to the United States Senate. His populist base was energized when he emerged as a national progressive leader in the Senate, often clashing with conservatives like Nelson Aldrich. He initially supported President William Howard Taft, but broke with Taft after the latter failed to push a reduction in tariff rates. He challenged Taft for the Republican presidential nomination in the 1912 presidential election, but his candidacy was overshadowed by that of former President Theodore Roosevelt. La Follette&#x27;s refusal to support Roosevelt alienated many progressives, and although La Follette continued to serve in the Senate, he lost his stature as the leader of that chamber&#x27;s progressive Republicans. La Follette supported some of President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s policies, but he broke with the president over foreign policy. During World War I, La Follette was one of the most outspoken opponents of the administration&#x27;s domestic and international policies and was against the war.

With the Republican and Democratic parties each nominating conservative candidates in the 1924 presidential election, left-wing groups coalesced behind La Follette&#x27;s third-party candidacy. With the support of the Socialist Party, farmer&#x27;s groups, labor unions, and others, La Follette briefly appeared to be a serious threat to unseat Republican President Calvin Coolidge. La Follette stated that his chief goal was to break the &quot;combined power of the private monopoly system over the political and economic life of the American people&quot;, and he called for government ownership of railroads and electric utilities, cheap credit for farmers, the outlawing of child labor, stronger laws to help labor unions, protections for civil liberties, and a 10-year term for members of the federal judiciary. His complicated alliance was difficult to manage, and the Republicans came together to win the 1924 election. La Follette won 16.6% of the popular vote, one of the best third party performances in U.S. history. He died shortly after the presidential election, but his sons, Robert M. La Follette Jr. and Philip La Follette, succeeded him as progressive leaders in Wisconsin.

==Early life==
Robert Marion La Follette Sr. was born on a farm in Primrose, Wisconsin, on June 14, 1855. He was the youngest of five children born to Josiah La Follette and Mary Ferguson, who had settled in Wisconsin in 1850. Josiah descended from French Huguenots, while Mary was of Scottish ancestry. La Follette&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, Joseph La Follette emigrated from France to New Jersey in 1745. La Follette&#x27;s great-grandfather moved to Kentucky, where they were neighbors to the Lincoln family.

Josiah died just eight months after Robert was born, and in 1862, Mary married John Saxton, a wealthy, seventy-year-old merchant. La Follette&#x27;s poor relationship with Saxton made for a difficult childhood. Though his mother was a Democrat, La Follette became, like most of his neighbors, a member of the Republican Party.

La Follette began attending school at the age of four, though he often worked on the family farm. After Saxton died in 1872, La Follette, his mother, and his older sister moved to the nearby town of Madison. La Follette began attending the University of Wisconsin in 1875 and graduated in 1879 with a Bachelor of Science degree. He was a mediocre student, but won a statewide oratory contest and established a student newspaper named the &quot;University Press&quot;. He was deeply influenced by the university&#x27;s president, John Bascom, on issues of morality, ethics, and social justice. During his time at the university, he became a vegetarian, declaring that his diet gave him more energy and a &quot;clear head&quot;.

La Follette met Belle Case while attending the University of Wisconsin, and they married on December 31, 1881, at her family home in Baraboo, Wisconsin. She became a leader in the feminist movement, an advocate of women&#x27;s suffrage and an important influence on the development of La Follette&#x27;s ideas.

==Early political career==
===House of Representatives===

La Follette was admitted to the state bar association in 1880. That same year, he won election as the district attorney for Dane County, Wisconsin, beginning a long career in politics. He became a protégé of George E. Bryant, a wealthy Republican Party businessman and landowner from Madison. In 1884, he won election to the House of Representatives, becoming the youngest member of the subsequent 49th Congress. His political views were broadly in line with those of other Northern Republicans at the time; he supported high tariff rates and developed a strong relationship with William McKinley. He did, however, occasionally stray from the wishes of party leaders, as he voted for the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 and the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. He also denounced racial discrimination in the Southern United States and favored the Lodge Bill, which would have provided federal protections against the mass disenfranchisement of African Americans in the South. &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; referred to him as being &quot;so good a fellow that even his enemies like him&quot;. Views on racial and ethnic matters were not central to La Follette&#x27;s political thinking. His wife was a stronger proponent of civil rights.

At 35 years old, La Follette lost his seat in the 1890 Democratic landslide. Several factors contributed to his loss, including a compulsory-education bill passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature in 1889. Because the law required major subjects in schools to be taught in English, it contributed to a divide between the Catholic and Lutheran communities in Wisconsin. La Follette&#x27;s support for the protective McKinley Tariff may have also played a role in his defeat. After the election, La Follette returned to Madison to begin a private law practice. Author Kris Stahl wrote that due to his &quot;extraordinarily energetic&quot; and dominating personality, he became known as &quot;Fighting Bob&quot; La Follette.

===Gubernatorial candidate===

In his autobiography, La Follette explains that he experienced a political epiphany in 1891 after Senator Philetus Sawyer attempted to bribe him. La Follette claimed that Sawyer offered the bribe so that La Follette would influence his brother-in-law, Judge Robert G. Siebecker, who was presiding over a case involving state funds that Republican officials had allegedly embezzled. La Follette&#x27;s public allegation of bribery precipitated a split with many friends and party leaders, though he continued to support Republican candidates like John Coit Spooner. He also strongly endorsed McKinley&#x27;s run for president in the 1896 election, and he denounced Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan as a radical. Rather than bolting the party or retiring from politics, La Follette began building a coalition of dissatisfied Republicans, many of whom were relatively young and well-educated. Among his key allies were former governor William D. Hoard and Isaac Stephenson, the latter of whom published a pro-La Follette newspaper. La Follette&#x27;s coalition also included many individuals from the state&#x27;s large Scandinavian population, including Nils P. Haugen, Irvine Lenroot, and James O. Davidson.

Beginning in 1894, La Follette&#x27;s coalition focused on winning the office of Governor of Wisconsin. With La Follette serving as his campaign manager, Haugen sought the Republican nomination for governor in 1894, but he was defeated by William H. Upham. La Follette ran for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1896, but he was beaten by Edward Scofield; La Follette alleged that Scofield only won the nomination after conservative party leaders bribed certain Republican delegates. La Follette declined to run as an independent despite the pleas of some supporters, and after the election, he turned down an offer from President William McKinley to serve as the Comptroller of the Currency. In 1897, La Follette began advocating the replacement of party caucuses and conventions, the traditional method of partisan nominations for office, with primary elections, which allowed voters to directly choose party nominees. He also denounced the power of corporations, charging that they had taken control of the Republican Party. These progressive stances had become increasingly popular in the wake of the Panic of 1893, a severe economic downturn that caused many to reevaluate their political beliefs.

La Follette ran for governor for the second time in 1898, but he was once again defeated by Scofield in the Republican primary. In 1900, La Follette made a third bid for governor, and won the Republican nomination, in part because he reached an accommodation with many of the conservative party leaders. Running in a strong year for Republicans nationwide, La Follette decisively defeated his Democratic opponent Louis G. Bomrich in the general election, winning just under 60 percent of the vote.

== Governor of Wisconsin (1901–1906) ==

Upon taking office, La Follette called for an ambitious reform agenda, with his two top priorities being the implementation of primary elections and a reform of the state&#x27;s tax system. La Follette initially hoped to work with the conservative faction of the Republican Party to pass these reforms, but conservatives and railroad interests broke with the governor. La Follette vetoed a primary election bill that would have applied only to local elections, while the state Senate voted to officially censure the governor after he attacked the legislature for failing to vote on his tax bill. Conservative party leaders attempted to deny La Follette renomination in 1902, but La Follette&#x27;s energized supporters overcame the conservatives and took control of the state convention, implementing a progressive party platform. In the 1902 general election, La Follette decisively defeated the conservative Democratic nominee, Mayor David Stuart Rose of Milwaukee.

In the aftermath of the 1902 election, the state legislature enacted the direct primary (subject to a statewide referendum) and La Follette&#x27;s tax reform bill. The new tax law, which required railroads to pay taxes based on property owned rather than profits, resulted in railroads paying nearly double the amount of taxes they had paid before the enactment of the law. Having accomplished his first two major goals, La Follette next focused on regulating railroad rates, but the railroads prevented passage of his bill in 1903. During this period, La Follette became increasingly convinced of the need for a direct income tax in order to minimize tax avoidance by the wealthy. During his governorship, La Follette appointed African-American William Miller for a position in his office.

After the legislature adjourned in mid-1903, La Follette began lecturing on the Chautauqua circuit, delivering 57 speeches across the Midwest. He also earned the attention of muckraker journalists like Ray Stannard Baker and Lincoln Steffens, many of whom supported La Follette&#x27;s progressive agenda. La Follette&#x27;s continued movement towards progressivism alienated many Republican Party leaders, and La Follette&#x27;s followers and conservative party leaders held separate conventions in 1904; ultimately, the state Supreme Court declared that La Follette was the Republican Party&#x27;s 1904 gubernatorial nominee. In the general election in Wisconsin that year, La Follette won 51 percent of the vote, but he ran far behind Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, who took 63 percent of the Wisconsin&#x27;s vote in the national election by comparison. In that same election, Wisconsin voters approved the implementation of the direct primary.

During the 1904 campaign, La Follette pledged that he would not resign as governor during his term, but after winning re-election he directed state representative Irvine Lenroot, a close political ally, to secure his election to the United States Senate. Shortly after La Follette delivered the inaugural message of his third term as governor, Lenroot began meeting with other legislators to assure that La Follette would be able to win election to the Senate; at that time, the state legislature elected senators. La Follette was formally nominated by the Republican caucus on January 23, 1905, and the state legislature chose him the following day. La Follette delayed accepting the nomination and continued to serve as governor until December 1905, when he announced his resignation. Throughout 1905, La Follette continued to push his progressive policies, including the state regulation of railroad rates. The state legislature passed a relatively weak regulation bill that La Follette considered vetoing, but he ultimately signed the law. Lieutenant Governor James O. Davidson succeeded La Follette as governor and went on to win re-election in 1906.

== Senator (1906–1925) ==

=== Roosevelt administration (1906–1909) ===

La Follette immediately emerged as a progressive leader in the Senate. At first, he focused on a railroad regulation bill making its way through the Senate; he attacked the bill, eventually known as the Hepburn Act, as a watered-down compromise. He also began campaigning across the country, advocating for the election of progressive senators. Conservative party leaders, including Spooner and Nelson W. Aldrich, detested La Follette, viewing him as a dangerous demagogue. Hoping to deprive La Follette of as much influence as possible, Aldrich and his allies assigned La Follette to insignificant committees and loaded him down with routine work. Nonetheless, La Follette found ways to attack monopolistic coal companies, and he pressed for an expansion of the railroad regulation powers of the Interstate Commerce Committee.

With the help of sympathetic journalists, La Follette also led the passage of the 1907 Railway Hours Act, which prohibited railroad workers from working for more than 16 consecutive hours. Though he initially enjoyed warm relations with President Roosevelt, La Follette soured somewhat on the president after Roosevelt declined to support some progressive measures like physical valuation of Railroad properties. When Roosevelt did not support La Follette&#x27;s bill to withdraw mineral land from corporate exploitation, La Follette told to Belle that Roosevelt &quot;throws me down every day or so&quot;. Meanwhile, La Follette alienated some of his supporters in Wisconsin by favoring Stephenson, his main donor, over Lenroot in an election to fill the seat of retiring Senator John Coit Spooner. After the Panic of 1907, La Follette strongly opposed the Aldrich–Vreeland Act, which would authorize the issuance of $500 million in bond-backed currency. He alleged that the panic had been engineered by the &quot;Money Trust&quot;, a group of 97 large corporations that sought to use the panic to destroy competitors and force the government to prop up their businesses. La Follette was unable to prevent the passage of the bill, but his 19-hour speech, the longest filibuster in Senate history up to that point, proved popular throughout the country.

Beginning in 1908, La Follette repeatedly sought election as the president. La Follette hoped that the backing of influential journalists like Lincoln Steffens and William Randolph Hearst would convince Republican leaders to nominate him for president in 1908, but he was unable to build a strong base of support outside of Wisconsin. Though he entered the 1908 Republican National Convention with the backing of most Wisconsin delegates, no delegates outside of his home state backed his candidacy. At the start of the convention, Secretary of War William Howard Taft was President Roosevelt&#x27;s preferred choice, but Taft was opposed by some conservatives in the party. La Follette hoped that he might emerge as the Republican presidential nominee after multiple ballots, but Taft won the nomination on the first ballot of the convention. La Follette was nonetheless pleased that the party platform called for a reduction of the tariff and that Taft indicated that he would emulate Roosevelt&#x27;s support for progressive policies. Taft defeated William Jennings Bryan in the 1908 election, and several progressives were victorious in the concurrent congressional elections. In early 1909, La Follette launched &quot;La Follette&#x27;s Weekly Magazine&quot;, which quickly achieved a circulation of well over 30,000. An early associate editor of the magazine was the writer Herbert Quick. In March 1924, La Follette contributed to the appointment of African-American Walter I. Cohen as Comptroller of the Port of New Orleans.

=== Battling the Taft administration (1909–1913) ===
Along with Jonathan P. Dolliver, La Follette led a progressive faction of Republicans in the Senate that clashed with Aldrich over the reduction of tariff rates. Their fight for tariff reduction was motivated by a desire to lower prices for consumers, as they believed that the high rates of the 1897 Dingley Act unfairly protected large corporations from competition and thereby allowed those corporations to charge high prices. Despite a widespread desire among consumers for lower prices, and a party platform that called for tariff reduction, Aldrich and other party leaders put forward the Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act, which largely preserved the high tariff rates of the Dingley Act. With the support of President Taft, the Payne–Aldrich Tariff passed the Senate; all Republican senators except for La Follette&#x27;s group of progressives voted for the tariff. The progressives did, however, begin the process of proposing the Sixteenth Amendment, which would effectively allow the federal government to levy an income tax.

In late 1909, Taft fired Louis Glavis, an official of the Department of the Interior who had alleged that Secretary of the Interior Richard A. Ballinger favored the illegal expansion of coal mining on government land in Alaska. The resulting Pinchot–Ballinger controversy pitted Ballinger and Taft against Gifford Pinchot, the head of the United States Forest Service and a close friend of Theodore Roosevelt. La Follette&#x27;s progressives strongly criticized the Taft administration for its handling of the controversy and initiated a congressional investigation into the affair.

La Follette&#x27;s successful re-election campaign in early 1911 further bolstered his position as the leader of the progressive faction of the Republican Party. In January 1911, after consulting with sympathetic journalists and public officials, La Follette launched the National Progressive Republican League, an organization devoted to passing progressive laws such as primary elections, the direct election of U.S. senators, and referendums. La Follette hoped that the league would also form a base of support for a challenge against Taft for the 1912 Republican presidential nomination. The league won the endorsement of nine senators, 16 congressmen, four governors, and well-known individuals such as Pinchot and Louis Brandeis, but notably lacked the support of former President Roosevelt. Explaining his refusal to join the league, Roosevelt asserted that he viewed the organization as too radical, stating his &quot;wish to follow in the path of Abraham Lincoln rather than in the path of John Brown and Wendell Phillips&quot;.

By mid-1911, most progressives believed that the battle for the 1912 Republican nomination would be waged between La Follette and Taft, but La Follette himself feared that Roosevelt would jump into the race. Many progressive leaders strongly criticized La Follette for focusing on writing his autobiography rather than on campaigning across the country. La Follette believed that his autobiography would help him win votes, and said: &quot;Every line of this autobiography is written for the express purpose of exhibiting the struggle for a more representative government which is going forward in this country, and to cheer on the fighters for that cause.&quot; Roosevelt announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in early 1912, but La Follette rejected the request of Pinchot and some other progressive leaders to drop out of the race and endorse the former president.

In Philadelphia on February 2, 1912, La Follette delivered a disastrous speech to the Periodical Publishers Banquet. He spoke for two hours before an audience of 500 nationally influential magazine editors and writers. Congressman Henry Cooper, a friend and ally of the senator, was there and made a memorandum:La Follette killed himself politically by his most unfortunate (worse than that) speech. It was a shocking scene. He lost his temper repeatedly—shook his fist—at listeners who had started to walk out too tired to listen longer—was abusive, ugly in manner...From the very outset his speech was tedious, inappropriate (for a banquet occasion like that), stereotyped; like too many others of his [it was] extreme in matter and especially in manner...LaFollette&#x27;s secretary, came over to me…and with a dejected, disgusted look said softly to me—&quot;This is terrible—he is making a d___d fool of himself.&quot; It ends him for the Presidency.Most of the audience decided La Follette had suffered a mental breakdown, and most of his supporters shifted to Roosevelt. La Follette&#x27;s family said he was distraught after learning that his daughter, Mary, required surgery. She recovered but his candidacy did not. Nonetheless, La Follette continued to campaign, focusing his attacks on Roosevelt rather than Taft.

La Follette hoped to rejuvenate his campaign with victories in the 1912 Republican primaries, but was able to win in only Wisconsin and North Dakota. He continued to oppose Roosevelt at the 1912 Republican National Convention, which ultimately re-nominated Taft. Roosevelt&#x27;s supporters bolted the Republican Party, established the Progressive Party, and nominated Roosevelt on a third party ticket. La Follette continued to attack Roosevelt, working with conservative Senator Boies Penrose, with whom La Follette shared only a dislike of Roosevelt, to establish a committee to investigate the sources of contributions to Roosevelt&#x27;s 1904 and 1912 campaigns. A filibuster threat by La Follette helped secure the passage of the enabling resolution. La Follette otherwise remained neutral in the three-way general election contest between Roosevelt, Taft, and the Democratic nominee, Woodrow Wilson. With the Republican Party split, Wilson emerged triumphant in the 1912 election. La Follette&#x27;s conduct during the campaign destroyed his standing as the leader of progressive Republicans in the Senate, as many progressives believed that La Follette&#x27;s refusal to work with Roosevelt had damaged the progressive cause and abetted Taft&#x27;s re-nomination as Republican candidate.

=== Wilson administration (1913–1921) ===
La Follette initially hoped to work closely with the Wilson administration, but Wilson ultimately chose to rely on congressional Democrats to pass legislation. Nonetheless, La Follette was the lone Republican senator to vote for the Revenue Act of 1913, which lowered tariff rates and levied a federal income tax. La Follette, who wanted to use the income tax for the purpose of income redistribution, influenced the bill by calling for a higher surtax on those earning more than $100,000 per year. La Follette and his fellow progressives challenged Wilson&#x27;s proposed Federal Reserve Act as being overly-friendly towards the banking establishment, but Wilson convinced Democrats to enact his bill. La Follette also clashed with Southern Democrats like James K. Vardaman, who directed the farm benefits of the Smith–Lever Act of 1914 away from African-Americans. In 1915, La Follette won passage of the Seamen&#x27;s Act, which allowed sailors to quit their jobs at any port where cargo was unloaded; the bill also required passenger ships to include lifeboats.

In the 1914 mid-term elections, La Follette and his progressive allies in Wisconsin suffered a major defeat when conservative railroad executive Emanuel L. Philipp won election as governor. La Follette fended off a primary challenge in 1916 and went on to decisively defeat his Democratic opponent in the general election, but Philipp also won re-election. By 1916, foreign policy had emerged as the key issue in the country, and La Follette strongly opposed American interventions in Latin America. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, La Follette praised the Wilson administration&#x27;s policy of neutrality, but he broke with the president as Wilson pursued policies favorable to the Allied Powers. Theodore Roosevelt called him a &quot;skunk who ought to be hanged&quot; when he opposed the arming of American merchant ships.

====Opposition to American involvement in World War I====
La Follette opposed United States entry into World War I. On April 4, 1917, the day of the vote on a war declaration by the US Congress, La Follette in a debate before the US Senate said, &quot;Stand firm against the war and the future will honor you. Collective homicide can not establish human rights. For our country to enter the European war would be treason to humanity.&quot; Eventually, the U.S. Senate voted to support entry to the war 82–6, with the resolution passing the House of Representatives 373–50 two days later. La Follette faced immediate pushback, including by the &quot;Wisconsin State Journal&quot;, whose editorial claimed La Follette to be acting on behalf of German interests. The newspaper said, &quot;It reveals his position to be decidedly pro-German (and) un-American... It is nothing short of pathetic to witness a man like La Follette, whose many brave battles for democracy have endeared him to the hearts of hundreds of thousands of Americans, now lending himself to the encouragement of autocracy. And that is all it is&quot;. After the U.S. declared war, La Follette denounced many of the administration&#x27;s wartime policies, including the Selective Service Act of 1917 and the Espionage Act of 1917. This earned the ire of many Americans, who believed that La Follette was a traitor to his country, effectively supporting Germany. It also resulted in a Senate Committee pursuing a vote to expel him from the Senate for disloyalty, due to an antiwar speech he made in 1917; the Committee ultimately recommended against expulsion and the Senate agreed, 50–21, in early 1919.

After the outbreak of the Russian Revolution in late 1917, La Follette supported the Bolsheviks, whom he believed to be &quot;struggling to establish an industrial democracy&quot;. He denounced the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in 1919, which he thought stemmed from Wilson&#x27;s desire to prevent the spread of socialism. During the First Red Scare, a post-war period in the United States marked by the widespread fear of socialism and anarchism, La Follette condemned the Palmer Raids, sought the repeal of the Espionage Act, and proposed amnesty for political prisoners like Eugene V. Debs. Along with a diverse array of progressive and conservative Republican senators, he helped prevent the U.S. from ratifying the Treaty of Versailles. La Follette believed that the League of Nations, a vital component of the Treaty of Versailles, was primarily designed to protect the dominant financial interests of the United States and the Allied Powers.

=== Harding–Coolidge administration (1921–1924) ===
La Follette retained influence in Wisconsin after the war, and he led a progressive delegation to the 1920 Republican National Convention. Nationwide, however, the Republican Party had increasingly embraced conservatism, and La Follette was denounced as a Bolshevik when he called for the repeal of the 1920 Esch–Cummins Act. After the Republican Party nominated conservative senator Warren G. Harding, La Follette explored a third-party presidential bid, though he ultimately did not seek the presidency because various progressive groups were unable to agree on a platform. After the 1920 presidential election, which was won by Harding, La Follette became part of a &quot;farm bloc&quot; of congressmen who sought federal farm loans, a reduction in tariff rates, and other policies designed to help farmers. He also resisted the tax cuts proposed by Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon, and his opposition helped prevent Congress from cutting taxes as deeply as had been proposed by the secretary of the treasury.

In 1922, La Follette decisively defeated a primary challenge from conservative allies of President Harding, and he went on to win re-election with 81 percent of the vote. Nationwide, the elections saw the defeat of many conservative Republicans, leaving La Follette and his allies with control of the balance of power in Congress. After the Supreme Court struck down a federal child labor law, La Follette became increasingly critical of the Court, and he proposed an amendment that would allow Congress to repass any law declared unconstitutional. La Follette also began investigations into the Harding administration, and his efforts ultimately helped result in the unearthing of the Teapot Dome scandal. Harding died in August 1923 and was succeeded by Vice President Calvin Coolidge, who was firmly in the conservative wing of the Republican Party.

In 1920–21, La Follette continued his support for the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War, in addition to his vigorous denunciation of imperialism and militarism in that conflict and beyond. In the American and British versions, he continued to oppose the treaty oversight settlement and continued to reject the League of Nations. He advocated self-government for Ireland, India, Egypt, and withdrawal of foreign interest from China. By 1922, he focused primarily on domestic affairs.

==1924 presidential campaign==

By 1924, conservatives were ascendant in both major parties. In 1923, La Follette began planning his final stand for a third party run for the presidency, sending his allies to various states to build up a base of support and ensure ballot access. In early 1924, a group of labor unions, socialists, and farm groups, inspired by the success of Britain&#x27;s Labour Party, established the Conference for Progressive Political Action (CPPA) as an umbrella organization of left-wing groups. Aside from labor unions and farm groups, the CPPA also included groups representing African Americans, women, and college voters. The CPPA scheduled a national convention to nominate a candidate for president in July 1924. La Follette had changed his previous pro-Bolshevik stance after visiting the Soviet Union in late 1923, where he had seen the impact of Communism on civil liberties and political rights. During that same time, La Follette visited England, Germany and Italy, where he expressed his dismay at the lack of freedom in the press to leader Benito Mussolini. With other left-wing groups supporting La Follette, the Communist Party nominated its first ever candidate for president, William Z. Foster.

On July 3, 1924, one day before the CPPA convention, La Follette announced his candidacy in the 1924 presidential election, stating that, &quot;to break the combined power of the private monopoly system over the political and economic life of the American people is the one paramount issue.&quot; The CPPA convention, which was dominated by supporters of La Follette, quickly endorsed his presidential bid. La Follette&#x27;s first choice for his running mate, Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court Louis Brandeis, refused to join the campaign. The convention instead nominated Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana, a progressive Democrat who had refused to endorse John W. Davis, the Democratic nominee for president. Though the Socialists pushed for a full slate of candidates, at La Follette&#x27;s insistence, the CPPA did not establish a formal third party or field candidates for races other than the presidency. La Follette would appear on the ballot in every state except Louisiana, but his ticket was known by a variety of labels, including &quot;Progressive&quot;, &quot;Socialist&quot;, &quot;Non-Partisan&quot;, and &quot;Independent&quot;.

After the convention, the Socialist Party of America, acting on the advice of perennial presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs, endorsed La Follette&#x27;s candidacy. The American Federation of Labor and numerous other worker&#x27;s groups also threw their support behind La Follette. Among the notable individuals who endorsed La Follette were birth control activist Margaret Sanger, African-American leader W. E. B. Du Bois, economist Thorstein Veblen, and newspaper publisher E. W. Scripps. Harold L. Ickes and some other progressives who had supported Roosevelt&#x27;s 1912 candidacy threw their backing behind La Follette, though others, including Gifford Pinchot, endorsed Coolidge. Another group supporting La Follette was the Steuben Society, a German-American organization that claimed a membership of six million.

La Follette&#x27;s platform was based on many of the issues that he had been campaigning on throughout his political career. He called for government ownership of the railroads and electric utilities, cheap credit for farmers, the outlawing of child labor, stronger laws to help labor unions, more protection of civil liberties, an end to American imperialism in Latin America, and a referendum before any president could again lead the nation into war.

Professional gamblers initially gave La Follette a 16-to-1 odds of winning, and many expected that his candidacy would force a contingent election in the House of Representatives. As election day approached, however, those hoping for a La Follette victory became more pessimistic. The various groups supporting La Follette often clashed, and his campaign was not nearly as well-financed as those of Davis and especially Coolidge. Corporate leaders, who saw in La Follette the specter of class warfare, mobilized against his third-party candidacy. Republicans campaigned on a &quot;Coolidge or chaos&quot; platform, arguing that the election of La Follette would severely disrupt economic growth. Having little fear of a Democratic victory, the Republican Party mainly focused its campaign attacks on La Follette.

In August and September, La Follette expressed his opposition to the Ku Klux Klan, describing the organization as containing &quot;seeds of death&quot; in its own body and his hatred for immigration quotas on the basis of racial discrimination, while defending control of immigration regarding economic issues. In response to La Follette&#x27;s statements regarding the Klan, Imperial Wizard Hiram Wesley Evans denounced La Follette as being the &quot;arch enemy of the country&quot;.

Ultimately, La Follette took 16.6 percent of the vote, while Coolidge won a majority of the popular and electoral vote. La Follette carried his home state of Wisconsin and finished second in eleven states, all of which were west of the Mississippi River. He performed best in rural areas and working-class urban areas, with much of his support coming from individuals affiliated with the Socialist Party. La Follette&#x27;s 16.6 percent showing represents the third best popular vote showing for a third party since the American Civil War (after Roosevelt in 1912 and Ross Perot in 1992), and with him winning of his home state of Wisconsin. The CPPA dissolved shortly after the election as various groups withdrew support.

==Death and legacy==
La Follette died in Washington, D.C., of a cardiovascular disease, complicated by bronchitis and pneumonia, on June 18, 1925, four days after his 70th birthday. He was buried in the Forest Hill Cemetery on the near west side of Madison, Wisconsin. After his death, his Senate seat was offered to his wife, Belle Case La Follette, but she declined the offer. Subsequently, his son Robert M. La Follette Jr. was elected to the seat.

After her husband&#x27;s death, Belle Case remained an influential figure and editor. By the mid-1930s, the La Follettes had reformed the Progressive Party on the state level in the form of the Wisconsin Progressive Party. The party quickly, if briefly, became the dominant political power in the state, electing seven Progressive congressmen in 1934 and 1936. Their younger son, Philip La Follette, was elected Governor of Wisconsin, while their older son, Robert M. La Follette Jr., succeeded his father as senator. La Follette&#x27;s daughter, Fola La Follette, was a prominent suffragette and labor activist and was married to the playwright George Middleton. A grandson, Bronson La Follette, served several terms as the Attorney General of Wisconsin and was the 1968 Democratic gubernatorial nominee. La Follette has also influenced numerous other progressive politicians outside of Wisconsin, including Floyd B. Olson, Upton Sinclair, Fiorello La Guardia, and Wayne Morse. Senator and 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has frequently been compared to La Follette.

In 1957, a Senate Committee chaired by Senator John F. Kennedy selected La Follette to be one of the five senators to be listed in the Senate &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;, along with Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, and Robert A. Taft. A 1982 survey asking historians to rank the &quot;ten greatest Senators in the nation&#x27;s history&quot; based on &quot;accomplishments in office&quot; and &quot;long range impact on American history&quot;, placed La Follette first, tied with Henry Clay. Writing in 1998, historian John D. Buenker described La Follette as &quot;the most celebrated figure in Wisconsin history&quot;. La Follette is represented by one of two statues from Wisconsin in the National Statuary Hall. An oval portrait of La Follette, painted by his cousin, Chester La Follette, also hangs in the Senate. The Robert M. La Follette House in Maple Bluff, Wisconsin, is a National Historic Landmark. Other things named for La Follette include La Follette High School in Madison, the Robert M. La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the town of La Follette, Wisconsin. Socialist historian Gabriel Kolko saw La Follette as &quot;standing apart from many Progressives in favoring competition, not monopoly (private or public).&quot;

The &quot;Fighting Bob Festival&quot; is an annual September tribute event held by Wisconsin progressives, sponsored by The Progressive and The Capital Times&quot;.&quot; It was founded in 2001 by Wisconsin labor lawyer and activist Ed Garvey. The Chautauqua-inspired Fighting Bob Fest has been held in Baraboo, Madison, La Crosse, Milwaukee, and Stevens Point. Speakers have included Wisconsin figures like Rep. Mark Pocan, former Sen. Russ Feingold, Sen. Tammy Baldwin and journalist John Nichols, other noted mid-westerners, as well as national progressive populist figures, like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Jim Hightower, Nina Turner and Jesse Jackson.

<doc id="255193" wikidata="Q3552074" url="?curid=255193" title="Up to Here">
<text>Up to Here is the debut studio album by Canadian rock band the Tragically Hip, released in September 1989. It is one of the band&#x27;s most successful albums, achieving diamond status in Canada for sales of over a million copies, earning the band a Juno Award for Most Promising Artist, and also introduced fan-favourite songs such as &quot;Blow at High Dough&quot;, &quot;New Orleans Is Sinking&quot;, and &quot;Boots or Hearts&quot;. The album reached on &quot;RPM&quot;s Canadian Albums Chart, and both &quot;Blow at High Dough&quot; and &quot;New Orleans is Sinking&quot; reached on the &quot;RPM&quot; Canadian Content singles charts.

An expanded anniversary reissue of the album was released in November 2024, including a remastered version of the band&#x27;s 1990 MuchMusic concert special &quot;Live at the Misty Moon&quot; and previously unreleased tracks from the era. The reissue was preceded by lead single &quot;Get Back Again&quot;, one of the most famous rarities in the band&#x27;s entire discography as they had occasionally performed it live but had never previously released a studio recording.

==Background==
The Tragically Hip toured extensively following their first release, &quot;The Tragically Hip&quot;, which had earned considerable airplay on Canadian FM radio and the MuchMusic video station. The band found an audience on US college radio as well and drew the attention of MCA representative Bruce Dickinson while performing at the CMJ New Music Festival in New York City in late 1988. That December Dickinson travelled to Toronto to see the band perform at the Toronto Music Awards, and MCA signed the band later that month.

Dickinson recommended the band record in Memphis, Tennessee, with producer Don Smith. The band entered Ardent Studios with a set of songs they had extensive experience playing live. Smith and the band further developed the arrangements in the studio before recording.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Up to Here&quot; was released on 5 September 1989. It sold copies within its first year in Canada and ranked 14th Canadian Content album for 1989, fifth for 1990, and first for 1991. The album peaked at in February 1990 on &quot;RPM&quot;s Canadian Albums Chart. The album went gold in Canada in January 1990 and platinum that March and later that year earned the band a Juno Award for Most Promising Artist. In 1999 &quot;Up to Here&quot; was awarded diamond status.

&quot;Up to Here&quot; was the band&#x27;s first release in the US. In 1990, the album peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart at and &quot;New Orleans Is Sinking&quot; reached on &quot;Billboard&quot;s Mainstream Rock singles chart. Despite strong sales and sustained popularity in Canada, the band and album failed to find a significant international audience; American sales of the album were in its first year and from 1991 to 1997 amounted to copies. The Tragically Hip&#x27;s relative lack of success in the US has been a frequent topic by commenters and interviewers, to the irritation of members of the band.

The songs are credited to the whole band. The band&#x27;s instrumentalists typically had the most influence on the music composition of the album while lead singer Gord Downie came up with his poetic lyrics separately, writing them in a notebook and incorporating them when the band was ready.

===Singles===
The hard-rocking lead single &quot;Blow at High Dough&quot; was released in April 1989, before the album&#x27;s release. It had a strong presence on Canadian radio and was the band&#x27;s first charting single, reaching on the &quot;RPM&quot; singles chart and on the &quot;RPM&quot; Canadian Content singles charts. &quot;Blow at High Dough&quot; was the theme song to the CBC comedy drama &quot;Made in Canada&quot; (1998—2003).

In November 1989, the second single was released, &quot;New Orleans Is Sinking&quot;, a loose jam piece which had been a key part the band&#x27;s live shows. In the midst of &quot;New Orleans&quot; the band often débuted new songs or gave Downie the spotlight to improvise. Like &quot;Blow at High Dough&quot;, it reached on the &quot;RPM&quot; Canadian Content singles charts, and on the &quot;RPM&quot; singles charts. Music videos were released for both &quot;Blow at High Dough&quot; and &quot;New Orleans is Sinking&quot;.

&quot;Boots or Hearts&quot; came out as the third single in February 1990, and &quot;38 Years Old&quot; followed in April 1990 as the fourth, peaking at on the &quot;RPM&quot; singles charts. Downie&#x27;s memories of a jailbreak in at the maximum-security Millhaven Institution inspired the lyrics to &quot;38 Years Old&quot;, whose ringing acoustic guitar backing is overlaid with distorted electric guitar leads.

&quot;Get Back Again&quot;, which was the lead single for the 2024 reissue, was left off the original album after having been plagued with problems during the recording process.

==Touring==
The Tragically Hip went on tour from June 1989 prior to the album&#x27;s release. The band continued to tour Canada and the US through 1990, and made its first European appearance at a sold-out headlining show in Rotterdam. The band gained a reputation for its energetic live shows and the enthusiasm of its fans.

The band introduced new material while touring which appeared on their next album &quot;Road Apples&quot; in 1991, along with numerous songs that, at the time, had never been officially released.

<text>High Society is a 1956 American musical romantic comedy film directed by Charles Walters and starring Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, and Frank Sinatra. The film was produced by Sol C. Siegel for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and shot in VistaVision and Technicolor, with music and lyrics by Cole Porter.

The film is a musical remake of the 1940 screwball comedy film &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;, which was based on the 1939 play &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; by Philip Barry. &quot;High Society&quot;&#x27;s screenplay was written by John Patrick and involves a successful popular jazz musician (Crosby) who tries to win back the affections of his ex-wife (Kelly), who is preparing to marry another man. The cast also features Celeste Holm, John Lund, and Louis Calhern, in his final film, with a musical contribution by Louis Armstrong. The film was Kelly&#x27;s last professional appearance before she married Prince Rainier III and became Princess consort of Monaco.

==Plot==
Successful singer-composer C.K. Dexter Haven is divorced from wealthy Newport, Rhode Island, socialite Tracy Samantha Lord. Dexter, who lives next door to the Lord estate, remains in love with her but she is now engaged to socially prominent and snobbish George Kittredge. As Tracy prepares for her upcoming wedding, Dexter is busily organizing elements of the Newport Jazz Festival.

Meanwhile, &quot;Spy&quot;, a tabloid newspaper, possesses embarrassing info about Tracy&#x27;s errant father, Seth Lord, and has coerced the family into allowing reporter Mike Connor and photographer Liz Imbrie to cover the nuptials. Tracy, resenting their forced presence, begins an elaborate charade, including introducing her Uncle Willy as her father, while Seth is passed off as &quot;wicked&quot; Uncle Willy.

As a wedding gift, Dexter gives Tracy a scale model of their former sailboat, &quot;True Love,&quot; which evokes her memories about their happy honeymoon aboard it. Tracy gradually realizes George knows little about her true self and has instead created an idealized image of her. When Tracy drives Mike around Newport, he notices some neglected mansions; Tracy explains many owners have been forced to board up or sell off their properties due to high taxes. Her Uncle Willy is selling his own estate. The two form a mutual attraction, leaving Tracy to choose from three very different men during a course of self-discovery. During the wedding-eve party at Uncle Willy&#x27;s house, George catches a tipsy Tracy kissing Dexter on the patio. George leaves Tracy in an empty room to sober up but, still tipsy, she climbs out the window and runs into Mike. George finds her again after she and Mike have had a swim in the Lords&#x27; pool. The next day, Tracy has hazy memories of the previous night. She initially intends to go through with the wedding, then prods George into agreeing to call it off. While informing the waiting guests the wedding is canceled, Dexter suddenly proposes that he be the groom. Knowing she loves him, Tracy accepts. Liz and Mike, who now realize they love each other, tell Tracy and Dexter that they are not writing a story about the wedding or other events to protect the family&#x27;s privacy.

==Production==

Filming took place between January and March 1956. The location scenes were mostly shot in and around Clarendon Court in Newport, Rhode Island, which was then owned by Mae Cadwell Hayward, and later purchased in 1970 by Claus von Bülow.

The location, according to Turner Classic Movies, enabled them to take advantage of the Newport Jazz Festival, established in 1954, incorporating it into the film by giving Crosby&#x27;s character a background as a descendant of a Gilded Age robber baron who became a jazz composer and friend of jazz star Louis Armstrong, who plays himself in the film, and patron of the Festival. As name-checked by Crosby in the song &quot;Now You Has Jazz&quot;, where each musician takes a small solo, Armstrong&#x27;s band members were Edmond Hall (clarinet), Trummy Young (trombone), Billy Kyle (piano), Arvell Shaw (bass), and Barrett Deems (drums).

This film featured Kelly&#x27;s final role before she became Princess of Monaco; it was released three months after her marriage to Prince Rainier III. In the film, Kelly wore the Cartier engagement ring given to her by Rainier. Sinatra was 40 and Crosby 53 while playing the love interests of Kelly, who was 26 during the filming. Sinatra biographers George Jacobs and William Stadiem claimed Crosby kept his distance from Sinatra during the production and remained strictly professional when Sinatra desired companionship, and that it &quot;killed&quot; Sinatra to think that Crosby considered himself a higher class singer. However, this is rejected by TCM, which states that &quot;in spite of a rumored rivalry between Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby, the two worked together very amicably during the shoot.&quot;

They claim that Sinatra was fascinated with Grace Kelly – as were many of her previous co-stars – and would have loved to have an affair with her but feared rejection and embarrassment in front of Crosby, who had previously had an affair with Kelly.

The sailboat used in the film, the True Love (originally the Venona II based on the Malabar design by John Alden built for racing), sails on Seneca Lake out of Watkins Glen, NY as an excursion boat for Seneca Sailing Adventures, LLC.

==Musical numbers==

Producer Sol C. Siegel paid Porter $250,000 for his first original film score in eight years; it introduced a couple of pop standards, including &quot;True Love&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Sensational&quot;. Not only did Sinatra and Crosby collaborate for the first time, but behind the scenes two master orchestrators – Conrad Salinger and Nelson Riddle – melded their arrangements under the baton of Johnny Green. Armstrong and his band get a couple of standout moments and Kelly has her only role in a musical.

# &quot;Overture&quot;
# &quot;High Society Calypso&quot; – Louis Armstrong &amp; his band
# &quot;Little One&quot; – C.K. (Bing Crosby)
# &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; – Mike (Frank Sinatra), Liz (Celeste Holm)
# &quot;True Love&quot; – C.K. (Crosby), Tracy (Grace Kelly)
# &quot;You&#x27;re Sensational&quot; – Mike (Sinatra)
# &quot;I Love You, Samantha&quot; – C.K. (Crosby)
# &quot;Now You Has Jazz&quot; – C.K. (Crosby), Armstrong &amp; his band, individually introduced by name
# &quot;Well, Did You Evah!&quot; – C.K. (Crosby), Mike (Sinatra)
# &quot;Mind if I Make Love to You?&quot; – Mike (Sinatra)

A soundtrack album was released the year of the film&#x27;s release and was a major success in both America and the United Kingdom. It has been said that one of the main reasons star Sinatra was drawn to the film was a mock-tipsy duet with his boyhood idol Crosby on &quot;Well, Did You Evah!&quot;, a song from an earlier Porter show, &quot;DuBarry Was a Lady&quot; (1939), re-adapted and added at the last minute when it was noted that the two singers did not have a duet to perform in the film.

The title of the song &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; gained new significance a half-century later as the title of a global game show franchise. &quot;I Love You, Samantha&quot; has also become a jazz favorite for improvisations.

==Reception==
Opening on July 17, 1956, &quot;High Society&quot; garnered mixed reviews, often being compared as a lesser offering to &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;, a previous adaptation in 1940 of the same play starring Cary Grant in the Crosby part, Katharine Hepburn in the Kelly role, and James Stewart in an Oscar-winning turn as the reporter played in the remake by Sinatra. &quot;Variety&quot; observed: &quot;&quot;High Society&quot; should spell high finance business all over. It&#x27;s a solid entertainment every minute of its footage. Fortified with a strong Cole Porter score, film is a pleasant romp for cast toppers Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly and Frank Sinatra who, tactfully, get alphabetical top billing. Their impact is almost equally consistent. Although Sinatra has the top pop tune opportunities, the Crooner makes his specialties stand up and out on showmanship and delivery, and Miss Kelly impresses as the femme lead with pleasantly comedienne overtones. This is perhaps her most relaxed performance ...&quot;

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;flimsy as a gossip-columnist&#x27;s word&quot;, missing &quot;the snap and the crackle that its un-musical predecessor had.&quot; According to &quot;Time&quot;, in spite of its &quot;Who&#x27;s Who cast&quot; the film is &quot;simply not top-drawer&quot;; a &quot;good deal of the screenplay seems as dated today as the idle rich ... [Kelly] lacks the gawky animal energy that Katharine Hepburn brought to the 1939 play and the 1941 movie, [Crosby] saunters through the part rather sleepily, without much of the old Bing zing [, and] Sinatra plays the reporter like a dead-end kid with a typewriter.&quot;

At the North American box-office, &quot;High Society&quot; was a success. It was one of the 10 highest-grossing films of 1956 in the US and Canada earning $5,602,000, and $2,656,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $1,148,000.

==Awards and nominations==
&quot;High Society&quot; received two Academy Award nominations, and nearly received a third. The film was initially nominated in the 1956 Academy Awards for Best Motion Picture Story, even though it was based on the 1940 film &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; and thus was not eligible in that category. Moreover, the nominated writers, Elwood Ullman and Edward Bernds, had written not this film, but a 1955 Bowery Boys film also titled &quot;High Society&quot;.

According to the book &quot;Inside Oscar&quot;, Steve Broidy, president of The Bowery Boys home studio Allied Artists, told the press, &quot;This just proves what we&#x27;ve known all along – that the Bowery Boys series couldn&#x27;t have lasted this long if not for the fine writers.&quot; The joking in the press aside, Ullman and Bernds sent a telegram to the Academy Award Board of Governors, acknowledging the error and requesting that their names be removed from the final ballot.

==Broadway adaptation==
More than 40 years following the film&#x27;s release, &quot;High Society&quot; was adapted for the stage as a Broadway musical with several Porter songs from other sources added to the score. The stage version of &quot;High Society&quot; opened on April 27, 1998, at the St. James Theatre, starring Melissa Errico as Tracy Lord, Daniel McDonald as C.K. Dexter Haven, Stephen Bogardus as Mike Conner, John McMartin as Uncle Willie, and, in her Broadway debut, a 12-year-old Anna Kendrick as Dinah Lord. Kendrick and McMartin received Tony Award nominations for their work as Best Featured Actress in a Musical and Best Featured Actor in a Musical. The show ran for 144 performances.

<text>The Zodiac Killer is the pseudonym of an unidentified serial killer who murdered five known victims in the San Francisco Bay Area between December 1968 and October 1969. The case has been described as &quot;arguably the most famous unsolved murder case in American history,&quot; and has become both a fixture of popular culture and a focus for efforts by amateur detectives.

The Zodiac&#x27;s known attacks took place in Benicia, Vallejo, unincorporated Napa County, and the City and County of San Francisco proper. He attacked three young couples and a lone male cab driver. Two of these victims survived. The Zodiac coined his name in a series of taunting messages that he mailed to regional newspapers, in which he threatened killing sprees and bombings if they were not printed. He also said that he was collecting his victims as slaves for the afterlife. He included four cryptograms or ciphers in his correspondence; two were decrypted in 1969 and 2020, and two are generally considered to be unsolved.

In 1974, the Zodiac claimed 37 victims in his last confirmed letter. This tally included victims in Southern California such as Cheri Jo Bates, who was murdered in Riverside in 1966. Despite many theories about the Zodiac&#x27;s identity, the only suspect authorities ever named was Arthur Leigh Allen, a former elementary school teacher and convicted sex offender who died in 1992.

The unusual nature of the case led to international interest that has been sustained throughout the years. The San Francisco Police Department marked the case &quot;inactive&quot; in 2004 but re-opened it prior to 2007. The case also remains open in the California Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, the city of Vallejo, as well as in Napa and Solano counties.

==Murders and correspondence==

Investigators agree on four confirmed attacks by the Zodiac Killer in California. Five victims were killed during these attacks, and two survived:
# David Arthur Faraday (17) and Betty Lou Jensen (16) were shot and killed on December 20, 1968, on Lake Herman Road in Benicia.
# Michael Renault Mageau (19) and Darlene Elizabeth Ferrin (22) were shot around midnight between July 4 and 5, 1969, in the parking lot of Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo. Mageau survived the attack; Ferrin was pronounced dead at Kaiser Foundation Hospital.
# Bryan Calvin Hartnell (20) and Cecelia Ann Shepard (22) were stabbed on September 27, 1969, at Lake Berryessa in Napa County. Hartnell survived, but Shepard died at Queen of the Valley Hospital as a result of her injuries on September 29.
# Paul Lee Stine (29) was shot and killed on October 11, 1969, in the Presidio Heights neighborhood of San Francisco.

From 1969 to 1974, the Zodiac mailed heavily misspelled letters and ciphers to law enforcement and media outlets. Some letters began, &quot;This is the Zodiac speaking&quot; and were signed with a symbol resembling the crosshairs of a gunsight: . Four of the mailings had a cryptogram enclosed. Two have been solved, in 1969 and 2020. The letters were postmarked in San Francisco and Pleasanton.

The Zodiac&#x27;s confirmed correspondence with date, recipient, and incipit:
#: &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, and &quot;Vallejo Times&quot;. One-third of &quot;Z408 cipher&quot; enclosed with each letter. &quot;I am the killer of the 2 teenagers last Christmass...&quot;
#: &quot;Examiner&quot;. &quot;This is the Zodiac speaking.&quot;
#: &quot;Chronicle&quot;. Swatch of Paul Stine&#x27;s shirt. &quot;I am the murderer of the taxi driver...&quot;
#: &quot;Chronicle&quot;. &quot;Z340 cipher.&quot; The &quot;Dripping Pen&quot; card. &quot;I though you would need a good laugh...&quot;
#: &quot;Chronicle&quot;. Bomb diagram. &quot;...I have killed 7 people&quot;.
#: Melvin Belli. Swatch of Stine&#x27;s shirt. &quot;...happy Christmass.&quot;
#: &quot;Chronicle&quot;. &quot;Z13 cipher.&quot; &quot;My name is...&quot;
#: &quot;Chronicle&quot;. Greeting card. &quot;I hope you enjoy yourselves...&quot;
#: &quot;Chronicle&quot;. &quot;Z32 cipher.&quot; &quot;I have become very upset...&quot;
#: &quot;Chronicle&quot;. &quot;I am rather unhappy...&quot;

#: &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. &quot;...I am crack proof.&quot;
#: &quot;Chronicle&quot;. The &quot;Exorcist&quot; letter.

===Lake Herman Road murders===

The first murders retroactively attributed to the Zodiac were the shootings of high school students Betty Lou Jensen (16) and David Arthur Faraday (17) on December 20, 1968. Faraday was a student at Vallejo High School, while Jensen was a student Hogan High School. At 8:30 p.m. Faraday picked up Jensen, and the couple visited one of Jensen&#x27;s friends. Sometime after 9 p.m., they drove to the outskirts of Vallejo and parked at a lover&#x27;s lane on Lake Herman Road, just inside Benicia city limits. Between 10:15–30 p.m., a passing motorist noticed the couple parked on a gravel runoff near the gate to a water pumping station. They were spotted again at 11 p.m.

Between 11:05–10 p.m., Faraday and Jensen were attacked. Police determined that their assailant parked his vehicle about ten feet alongside the passenger side of Faraday&#x27;s car. He fired several shots at Faraday&#x27;s car as he walked around to the driver&#x27;s side. None of the shots hit Faraday and Jensen. The couple scrambled to get out through the passenger door. Jensen succeeded. As Faraday was exiting, the killer shot him in the head with a .22-caliber pistol. The assailant chased Jensen as she fled, firing six shots at her back. Only one missed. Police theorized the whole attack took two to three minutes.

At 11:10 p.m., a motorist spotted the couple&#x27;s bodies and alerted police. Jensen was dead. Faraday was still breathing. He died at the hospital. There were no witnesses and no usable tire or foot prints. The only motive the police could deduce was a &quot;madman&quot; wanting to kill. Despite an intense investigation in the following months, no viable suspects emerged. The murders were extensively covered by the media.

===Blue Rock Springs murder===

Darlene Ferrin (22) and Michael Mageau (19) were shot shortly after midnight on July 4, 1969. Ferrin was popular in Vallejo due to her job at a local restaurant, where she met Mageau. On July 4, they went on a date despite the fact that Ferrin was married. After 11:30 p.m., Ferrin received a phone call at her house. She arrived at Mageau&#x27;s house around 11:50 p.m.

Immediately after leaving Mageau&#x27;s house, the couple noticed they were being followed by a man in a light-colored car. Ferrin drove out of Vallejo in the direction of Lake Herman Road. Shortly before midnight, she turned her car into an empty parking lot at Blue Rock Springs Park. This was another lover&#x27;s lane, located just two miles from Lake Herman Road. Ferrin either parked or stalled 70 feet from the lot entrance. Another vehicle parked about 80 feet to their left. The driver turned his headlights off and sat motionless. Mageau asked who the driver was. Ferrin told him not to worry. The stranger abruptly tore away from the parked couple.

Five minutes later, the stranger returned, parked a few feet next to Mageau&#x27;s side of the car and got out. He shone a flashlight into Ferrin&#x27;s car as he approached. Assuming he was a police officer, the couple rolled down Mageau&#x27;s window. Without speaking, the stranger fired a 9mm pistol into the car. One bullet hit Mageau in the right arm, and the other hit Ferrin in the neck. Mageau tried to leave the car, but his door handle was missing or removed. The assailant returned to his car, opened the door, and did something Mageau could not see. As Mageau struggled to exit the vehicle, the stranger shot him and Ferrin two more times each. The killer hurried into his car and drove off. A golf course caretaker heard the shots around 12:10 a.m. The perpetrator left no clues that could be traced back to him.

Three teenagers drove into the parking lot, saw the wounded couple, and got help. Police arrived at 12:20 a.m. Twenty minutes later, Ferrin was pronounced dead at the hospital. Mageau survived and described the attacker as a heavyset white man, around 5&#x27;8&quot; tall. He estimated the assailant&#x27;s weight as 195–200 pounds, with a large face and curly light brown hair. The killer wore dark clothes and no glasses. These details were not enough to develop a suspect. Moments after 12:40 a.m., the Vallejo Police Department (VPD) received a phone call from a payphone two blocks from headquarters. The man on the other end of the line said:&quot;I want to report a double murder. If you go one mile east on Columbus Parkway to the public park you will find kids in a brown car. They were shot with a 9-millimeter Luger. I also killed those kids last year. Goodbye.&quot;

Serial killers will commonly pause to reflect on their actions. Authors Michael Kelleher and David Van Nuys speculated that the seven months between the attacks on Lake Herman Road and at Blue Rock Springs was a &quot;cooling off period&quot; for the Zodiac.

====Ferrin—Zodiac prior relationship theory====

Many have speculated that Darlene Ferrin knew her killer. Kelleher and Nuys credit the origin of the theory to Robert Graysmith&#x27;s 1986 book &quot;Zodiac&quot;. He argued extensively for a connection based on interviews with Ferrin&#x27;s friends. A definitive connection has not been proven.

Mageau gave conflicting accounts on whether Ferrin knew her killer. At the hospital, he stated he did not know the murderer. At another point, he said the assailant&#x27;s name was &quot;Richard&quot;. Ferrin&#x27;s sister claimed one of Darlene&#x27;s boyfriends was named Richard. In the Zodiac&#x27;s later correspondence, he only ever refers to Ferrin as &quot;girl&quot;.

In Graysmith&#x27;s telling, Ferrin and Mageau were chased. They only stopped when their car hit a log and stalled. The detective on the scene noticed that the car was still on and in low gear. Kelleher and Nuys suggest that Ferrin would not tell Mageau to ignore the mystery driver, nor would they assume he was a police officer, if they had not stopped at the spot by choice.

Ferrin did know Betty Lou Jensen and David Faraday. She lived less than two blocks from Jensen and attended Hogan High School. She was also familiar with Lake Herman Road&#x27;s status as a lover&#x27;s lane. There is a picture of Ferrin and an unknown man who closely resembles a composite sketch of the Zodiac. In a 2011 episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, police stated they believe the photo was taken in San Francisco in either 1966 or 1967.

===First letters from the Zodiac===
On August 1, 1969, the &quot;Vallejo Times&quot;, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; all received letters written by someone taking credit for the attacks in Vallejo. were nearly identical and began, &quot;I am the killer of the 2 teenagers last Christmass at Lake Herman &amp; the girl last 4th of July.&quot; The three letters were rife with misspellings and presented the first definitive link between the two separate attacks in Vallejo.

Enclosed in all three letters was a different cryptogram. They combined to form a 408-symbol cipher (Z408). The writer claimed, &quot;In this cipher is my idenity.&quot; He demanded the codes be printed on each newspaper&#x27;s front page. If they were not, he threatened to &quot;cruse around all weekend killing lone people in the night then move on to kill again, until I end up with a dozen people over the weekend.&quot; The &quot;Chronicle&quot; published its third of the cryptogram inside the August 2nd edition. In the accompanying article, Vallejo Police Chief Jack E. Stiltz said, &quot;We&#x27;re not satisfied that the letter was written by the murderer&quot;. He requested the killer send more facts to prove his identity.

On August 4, the &quot;Examiner&quot; received with the salutation, &quot;Dear Editor This is the Zodiac speaking.&quot; This letter marked the debut of the Zodiac persona. It was the first time the killer called himself by this nickname.

In this second letter to the media, the killer wrote at much greater length. He happily obliged Chief Stiltz&#x27;s request for more information about both murders. He provided minute details about how he shot Michael Mageau. He described the golf course caretaker. Regarding the Lake Herman Road attack, he revealed that he had taped a flashlight to his gun in order to aim easily in the dark. The August 4th letter also referred investigators back to the Z408 cipher. The killer wrote, &quot;when they do crack it they will have me&quot;.
The decoded message did not reveal the Zodiac&#x27;s identity. Both the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) attempted to decrypt the Z408 cipher. On August 5, it was cracked by Donald and Bettye Harden, a couple in Salinas. Neither was a cryptologist. Bettye deployed a crib by correctly guessing the word &quot;kill&quot; would appear in the message.

The message was rife with misspellings and referred to Richard Connell&#x27;s 1924 short story &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot;. The Zodiac explained killing was a way of collecting slaves for his afterlife. The full text of the decoded Z408 cipher reads:
&quot;I like killing people because it is so much fun it is more fun than killing wild game in the forrest because man is the most dangeroue anamal of all to kill something gives me the most thrilling experence it is even better than getting your rocks off with a girl the best part of it is thae when I die I will be reborn in paradice and all the I have killed will become my slaves I will not give you my name because you will try to sloi down or atop my collectiog of slaves for my afterlife ebeorietemethhpiti&quot;

VPD asked a psychiatrist at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville to analyze the Zodiac&#x27;s message. The doctor concluded the writer felt omnipotent based on his fantasy about collecting spiritual slaves. The analysis described the Zodiac as &quot;someone you would expect to be brooding and isolated&quot;. The psychiatrist speculated the killer&#x27;s praise of murder over sex could be &quot;an expression of inadequacy&quot;.

=== Lake Berryessa murder ===

At 4:00 p.m. on September 27, 1969, Pacific Union College students Bryan Hartnell (20) and Cecelia Shepard (22) were picnicking at Lake Berryessa on a small island connected by a sand spit to Twin Oak Ridge. Sometime later, Shepard noticed a man watching them. When he emerged from behind a tree, he put on a black executioner&#x27;s hood with clip-on sunglasses. He wore a bib with a white 3x3&quot; symbol on it. He brandished a gun, which Hartnell believed was a .45. The Zodiac said he escaped from jail after killing a guard and needed their car and money to travel to Mexico.

Before tying up Shepard, the Zodiac made Shepard bind Hartnell with precut lengths of plastic clothesline. He tightened Hartnell&#x27;s bonds because Shepard&#x27;s knots were too loose. Hartnell still believed they were being robbed when the Zodiac drew a knife and stabbed them. Hartnell suffered six wounds and Shepard ten.

The Zodiac hiked 500 yards to Knoxville Road, leaving several footprints for investigators to study. The killer drew the symbol on Hartnell&#x27;s car door with a black felt-tip pen and wrote beneath it:After hearing the victims&#x27; screams, a fisherman and his son sought help. Hartnell untied Shepard&#x27;s ropes with his teeth, and she freed him. Two park rangers arrived and tended to the stricken couple until the ambulance arrived. Napa County deputies Dave Collins and Ray Land responded to the report of the attack. Shepard was conscious and gave a detailed description of their attacker. She and Hartnell were taken to a hospital in Napa. Shepard lapsed into a coma during transport; she never regained consciousness and died two days later. Hartnell survived to recount his tale to the press.
Earlier that day, a suspicious man had been seen around Lake Berryessa by several people. A dentist and his son saw a heavyset man looking at them from a distance before he hurried off. Around 2:50 p.m., three women noticed a strange man as they stopped on their way to Lake Berryessa. After they had arrived to sunbathe, they noticed the man again. Since they had potentially seen the Zodiac without his hood, the women worked with &quot;Napa Valley Register&quot; photographer Robert McKenzie to create a composite sketch using an Identi-Kit facial compositing device. Police showed the image to other potential witnesses.

The suspect was described as being roughly 6&#x27; tall and weighing 200 pounds, which matched the descriptions by Shepard and Hartnell. Graysmith also drew a sketch of the Zodiac&#x27;s costume after Hartnell described it to him. Napa County detective Ken Narlow was assigned to the case from the outset and worked on solving the crime until his retirement in 1987.

The Zodiac drove 27 miles from the crime scene to a car wash in downtown Napa. He used a payphone to call the Napa County Sheriff&#x27;s Department at 7:40 p.m. He told the dispatcher he wished to &quot;report a murder – no, a double murder&quot; and confessed to the crime. He did not hang up the phone. KVON radio reporter Pat Stanley found the phone off the hook a few minutes later. The payphone was located a few blocks from the sheriff&#x27;s office. Detectives lifted a wet palm print from the phone but were never able to match it to any suspect.

===Presidio Heights murder===

The last confirmed Zodiac murder took place two weeks after the Lake Berryessa attacks. Around 9:40 p.m. on October 11 in downtown San Francisco, the Zodiac hailed a cab which was driven by a doctoral student named Paul Stine. The killer gave a destination in Presidio Heights. When the taxi arrived at Washington and Maple streets, the killer asked to be driven another block. At Washington and Cherry around 9:55 p.m., the Zodiac shot Stine in the head with a handgun and took his wallet and car keys.

Three teenagers witnessed the crime from a house directly across the street from Stine&#x27;s cab. The Zodiac&#x27;s face was clearly visible by streetlight. The teenagers watched as the Zodiac wiped down the vehicle and rifled through Stine&#x27;s clothes. He left behind two partial fingerprints from his right hand. While the Zodiac was tending to the cab, the kids called the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). They described the criminal as a &quot;husky&quot; white man in a &quot;dark or black jacket&quot;. The dispatcher mistakenly alerted SFPD that the suspect was Black.

Just two minutes after the call to SFPD, two nearby patrol officers responded to the radio dispatch. They encountered a white man in dark clothes walking north towards the Presidio army base. They pulled alongside the man and asked if he had seen anything suspicious. The man confirmed he had seen someone waving a gun and heading east. The officers hurried away. The Zodiac later claimed he was the witness that spoke to the two officers. When police arrived at the scene, Stine was declared dead. SFPD canvassed the area, including the Presidio. The Zodiac had probably fled the area in a car by then.

Police assumed the murder was a result of the robbery. However, the Zodiac mailed a bloody piece of Paul Stine&#x27;s shirt to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; on October 13. He enclosed it in where he boasted about the murder and claimed to have clandestinely watched SFPD search for him. The Zodiac also threatened to shoot a tire on a school bus and kill children as they exited.

The teenage witnesses helped a police artist make a composite sketch of the man they saw at Stine&#x27;s cab. The two patrol officers who questioned the witness near the scene realized it may have been the Zodiac. They also helped develop a sketch of the suspect.

SFPD detectives Bill Armstrong and Dave Toschi were assigned to the case. Toschi ended up working on the case by himself and filled eight filing cabinets with potential suspects. In 1976 he told the Associated Press that Zodiac&#x27;s letters were an &quot;ego game&quot;. He believed the killer lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, &quot;He&#x27;s a weekend killer. Why can&#x27;t he get away Monday through Thursday? Does his job keep him close to home? I would speculate he maybe has a menial job, is well thought of and blends into the crowd...I think he&#x27;s quite intelligent and better educated than someone who misspells words as frequently as he does in his letters.&quot;

After working on the Zodiac case for seven years, Toschi started writing anonymous letters praising his own investigative work to &quot;Chronicle&quot; columnist Armistead Maupin. Two years later in 1978, Toschi was removed from the case and demoted to pawn shop detail. He expressed regret for the hoax. That same year, Maupin also received a purported Zodiac letter. SFPD investigated whether Toschi wrote it as well and concluded he did not.

=== &quot;A.M. San Francisco&quot; interview ===
On October 22, 1969, mental patient Eric Weill duped attorney Melvin Belli into a conversation on KGO-TV&#x27;s &quot;A.M. San Francisco&quot;. Investigators concluded Weill was not the Zodiac. He called the Oakland Police Department and demanded to speak to Belli or F. Lee Bailey on TV. During the show, Weill told Belli he would not reveal his identity for fear of being executed. He arranged a rendezvous with Belli on Mission Street in Daly City and did not show.

===November &amp; December 1969 correspondence===
On November 8, the Zodiac mailed (Z340) to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. He asked for his code to be printed on the front page. It remained unsolved for 51 years. One cryptologist ranked Zodiac&#x27;s unsolved ciphers second only to the Voynich manuscript. Zodiac ciphers were crowdsourced through a variety of websites, which led to gradual breakthroughs.

Z340 was deciphered by an international team of private citizens on December 5, 2020. The cryptology group included American software engineer David Oranchak, Australian mathematician Sam Blake and Belgian programmer Jarl Van Eycke. Using a program made by Van Eycke called AZdecrypt, the team ran 650,000 possible solutions for the cipher until the program came up with the best possible encryption key.

In the decrypted message, the Zodiac denied being the &quot;Sam&quot; who spoke on &quot;A.M. San Francisco&quot; and explained he was not afraid of the gas chamber &quot;because it will send me to paradice all the sooner.&quot; The team submitted their findings to the FBI&#x27;s Cryptographic and Racketeering Records Unit, which verified the decryption and concluded the decoded message gave no further clues to the Zodiac&#x27;s identity. Subsequent analysis confirmed the Z340 decryption using unicity distance as a measure.

The decoded Z340 cipher included the usual Zodiac respellings:&quot;I hope you are having lots of fan in trying to catch me that wasnt me on the tv show which bringo up a point about me I am not afraid of the gas chamber becaase it will send me to paradlce all the sooher because e now have enough slaves to worv for me where every one else has nothing when they reach paradice so they are afraid of death I am not afraid because i vnow that my new life is life will be an easy one in paradice death&quot;

On November 9, the Zodiac mailed to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. In his postscript, he claimed he was stopped and questioned by two policemen three minutes after he shot Stine. He threatened to blow up a school bus and included a diagram of the bomb. The Zodiac boasted police would never catch him because &quot;I have been to clever for them&quot;. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; excerpted the letter on November 12.

One year after the Lake Herman Road murders on December 20, the Zodiac mailed . He enclosed another swatch of Paul Stine&#x27;s shirt. He pleaded, &quot;Please help me I am drownding...I can not remain in control for much longer.&quot;

===April 1970 letter and card===
For the remainder of 1970, the Zodiac continued to communicate with authorities and the press by mail. In a postmarked April 20, he wrote, &quot;My name is—&quot;. It was followed by a 13-character cipher (Z13) which has not been definitively solved.

The Z13 cipher:

One cryptologist solved Z13 as &quot;Alfred E. Neuman&quot;, the mascot of humor magazine &quot;Mad&quot;.
In the same letter, the Zodiac denied responsibility for the fatal bombing of an SFPD police station in Golden Gate Park. He added, &quot;there is more glory to killing a cop than a cid because a cop can shoot back.&quot; He also included a diagram of another school bus bomb. At the bottom of the diagram, he wrote: &quot; = 10, SFPD = 0.&quot;

On April 28, 1970, the Zodiac mailed a to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. He wrote, &quot;I hope you enjoy yourselves when I have my BLAST.&quot; On the back of the card, the Zodiac threatened to use his bus bomb unless two things happened: the &quot;Chronicle&quot; should write about his bomb, and people should wear &quot;some nice Zodiac butons&quot;

===June 1970 letter and map===
In a postmarked June 26, 1970, the killer was upset no one was wearing Zodiac buttons. He claimed, &quot;...I punished them in another way. I shot a man sitting in a parked car with a .38.&quot; This may have been a reference to the murder of SFPD Sergeant Richard Radetich. He was shot through the window of his squad car by an unidentified gunman during a routine traffic stop. Radetich&#x27;s murder is unsolved, but the SFPD denies that Zodiac is a suspect in the case.

A Phillips 66 roadmap of the San Francisco Bay Area was enclosed with the letter. At Mount Diablo, the Zodiac drew a modified symbol as a compass rose. The cardinal points were labeled 0, 3, 6, 9 clockwise from the top. The Zodiac confirmed that 0 &quot;to be set to Mag. N.&quot;

The letter concluded with a 32-character cipher (Z32):
The Zodiac claimed that the map and the cipher would reveal where he had buried his bomb. Z32 has never been definitively decoded and no bomb was ever located. In another letter, the Zodiac explained, &quot;The Mt. Diablo code concerns Radians + # inches along the radians.&quot; In 1981, Gareth Penn deduced that when the map was divided as per the Zodiac&#x27;s hint, three of his attacks aligned along one radian. On one arm of the radian lay the Blue Rock Springs and Lake Herman Road murders. The other arm of the radian centered on Mount Diablo extended to the site of Paul Stine&#x27;s murder.

===July 1970 letters===
In a to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, the Zodiac again complained about no one wearing Zodiac-themed buttons. He claimed to have &quot;a little list&quot; of victims which included the woman and her baby he drove around for several hours. The details match Kathleen Johns&#x27; description of her abduction on March 22, four months earlier.

Two days later on July 26, the Zodiac mailed to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. He again parodied &quot;As Some Day It May Happen (I Have a Little List)&quot; from &quot;The Mikado&quot;, adding his own lyrics about his potential victims. The letter was signed with a large Zodiac symbol and a new score: &quot; = 13, SFPD = 0&quot;. The letter&#x27;s postscript explained the Mount Diablo code from his previous letter.

===October 1970 cards===
On October 7, 1970, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; received a (nicknamed the &quot;13 Hole Punch Card&quot;) signed by Zodiac with the symbol and a small cross reportedly drawn in blood. Thirteen holes were punched across the card, and its message was formed by pasting type from the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. Bill Armstrong and Dave Toschi agreed it was &quot;highly probable&quot; that Zodiac sent the card.

On October 27, 1970, Paul Avery received a signed by &quot;Z&quot; alongside the symbol. A handwritten note read, &quot;Peek-a-boo, you are doomed.&quot; The &quot;Chronicle&quot; covered this threat on its front page. The card&#x27;s postmark was from a San Francisco mailbox that afternoon. The implication of a fourteenth Zodiac victim was speculated based on the phrase &quot;4-teen&quot; found in the card. Avery refused police protection and started carrying a pistol. His colleagues wore &quot;I Am Not Avery&quot; buttons. Shortly after the &quot;Halloween Card&quot;, Avery also received an anonymous letter about the parallels between the 1966 murder of Cheri Jo Bates and the Zodiac.

=== March 1971 letter ===
In a March 13, 1971, , the Zodiac taunted police and claimed 17 victims. Zodiac expert Tom Voigt theorized that the letter&#x27;s postmark was a joke about an unpleasant letter coming from a town called &quot;Pleasanton&quot;.

=== January 1974 letter ===
Zodiac remained silent for nearly three years. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; received a , postmarked January 29, 1974 from San Mateo County. It complained that columnist Count Marco needed to &quot;feel superior to everyone&quot; and praised &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973) as &quot;the best satirical comedy that I have ever seen.&quot; The letter included part of a verse from &quot;Tit-willow Song&quot; in &quot;The Mikado&quot; and an unusual symbol at the bottom that has remained unexplained. Zodiac concluded the letter with a new score, &quot;Me = 37, SFPD = 0.&quot;

Psychiatrist David Van Nuys theorized Zodiac stopped killing because he had multiple personality disorder. It may have lessened over time as it often can, which would also explain the reduced intensity of Zodiac&#x27;s letters.

==Letters of suspicious authorship==
Many more unconfirmed Zodiac letters were sent to the media. On August 1, 1973, a letter was mailed to the &quot;Albany Times Union&quot; in New York. The return address was the symbol. The writer promised to kill again on August 10. A three-line code in the letter was supposed to reveal the name and location of the victim. FBI cryptanalysts deciphered the code as &quot;[redacted by the FBI] Albany Medical Center. This is only the beginning.&quot; No murder matched the details in the letter, and the handwriting was not a definitive match for Zodiac&#x27;s.

The &quot;Chronicle&quot; received a , explaining that the Symbionese Liberation Army&#x27;s initials spelled out an Old Norse word meaning &quot;kill.&quot; The SLA had recently kidnapped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst. The handwriting was not authenticated as the Zodiac&#x27;s.

A postmarked May 8, 1974, opined that &quot;Badlands&quot; (1973) was &quot;murder-glorification&quot; and asked the paper to remove its advertisements. Signed by &quot;A citizen&quot;, the handwriting, tone, and sarcasm were similar to Zodiac&#x27;s letters. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; also received an , complaining about antifeminist columnist Marco Spinelli. The letter was signed, &quot;the Red Phantom (red with rage)&quot;.

In 2007, an American Greetings Christmas card was discovered in the &quot;Chronicle&#x27;s&quot; photo files. Its postmark was from 1990 in Eureka. The card was handed over to the Vallejo police. A photocopy of two United States Post Office keys on a magnet keychain was enclosed. The handwriting on the envelope resembled Zodiac&#x27;s. A forensic document examiner deemed it inauthentic. The discovery electrified Zodiac researchers. It suggested the killing spree may not have been stopped by death or imprisonment and that the Zodiac might still be alive.

== Suspected victims ==
There is no consensus regarding the number of victims the Zodiac Killer actually killed or the length of his criminal spree. In 1976, SFPD detective Dave Toschi said, &quot;We know for sure he killed at least six&quot;, and the Zodiac had &quot;a personal boxscore of 37&quot;. Robert Graysmith estimated 49 Zodiac victims. Many high-profile murders and attacks in the 60s and 70s were seen as possible Zodiac crimes, but none have been confirmed.

=== Raymond Davis ===
On April 9, 1962, a man called the police in Oceanside, California and said, &quot;I am going to pull something here in Oceanside and you&#x27;ll never be able to figure it out.&quot; At 11:10 p.m. on April 10, cab driver Raymond Davis (29) told his dispatcher he was taking a fare to South Oceanside. The next day, his body was found near the mayor&#x27;s house in St. Malo, a gated community in Oceanside. Days later, the suspected killer called the police again, “Do you remember me calling you last week and telling you that I was going to pull a real baffling crime? I killed the cab driver and I am going to get me a bus driver next.” The police placed armed guards on buses.

In 2019, the unsolved murder was connected to the Zodiac when Kristi Hawthorne, the Director of the Oceanside Historical Society, was researching St. Malo for another project. She stumbled upon a story about Davis&#x27; murder and further research dug up several parallels to the Zodiac killings. Davis&#x27; murder prefigured Paul Stine&#x27;s by 7 years. Both cabbie murders involved wealthy neighborhoods. The ammunition was .22 caliber, which matches the Lake Herman Road attack. The taunting of police and the threat against buses also foreshadowed the Zodiac. Hawthorne presented her findings to the Oceanside Police Department, which began an inquiry.

===Robert Domingos and Linda Edwards===
On June 2, 1963, on the beach at Tajiguas in Santa Barbara County, California, an unidentified sniper fired two shots from a .22 caliber gun at a group of teenagers. None of them were hit. On June 4, on a beach within Gaviota State Park, just west of Tajiguas, Robert George Domingos (18) and his fiancée Linda Faye Edwards (17) were shot dead by an unidentified person. They were at the beach while skipping school at Lompoc High School for Senior Ditch Day. On June 5, when the couple had not returned home, their parents called the police. During a police search, several of the couple&#x27;s belongings, like Edwards&#x27; purse, were inside Domingos&#x27; car.

Police believed that the assailant attempted to bind the couple with pre-cut rope. This was the same &quot;modus operandi&quot; as the Lake Berryessa attacks. Likely, when the victims got loose and tried to flee, the killer shot them repeatedly in the back and chest. Domingos was shot 11 times and Edwards 8 times. The killer placed their bodies in a small shack nearby, and tried to burn it to the ground. The firearm was probably a .22 caliber semi-automatic rifle, like the Tajiguas and Lake Herman Road incidents. The Winchester Western Super X copper-coated bullets also matched the Zodiac&#x27;s. The lot number of the .22 ammunition was traced to an April purchase from a store in Santa Barbara. The only other place that lot number turned up was at Vandenberg Air Force Base near Lompoc. Investigators looked into purchases of the ammunition at both locations.

In a 1972 press conference, Santa Barbara County Sheriff John Carpenter stated &quot;there now appears to be a high degree of probability&quot; that the Zodiac committed the murders, and &quot;although the anticipated response to this statement would be one of skepticism, let me say that we do not make this assertion frivolously.&quot; When SFPD detectives Bill Armstrong and Dave Toschi investigated the murders in 1972, Toschi said a connection is possible. A classmate of Domingos and Edwards, who later became a clinical psychologist and police officer, said in 2011, &quot;I believe the murders were the work of the Zodiac killer, but I can’t prove it.&quot; 

=== Johnny Ray Swindle and Joyce Ann Swindle ===
On February 5, 1964, Johnny Ray Swindle and Joyce Ann Swindle (both 19), a newlywed couple from Alabama on their honeymoon, were shot while walking along Ocean Beach in San Diego. A sniper with a .22 caliber long rifle shot them five times from a nearby cliff. The killer then shot each of them once in the head at close range. Similar to the Zodiac murders, Johnny was shot behind the ear. Despite multiple bullet wounds, he remained alive for hours and died at the hospital. Joyce died almost instantly from shots to her back, left arm, and head. The killer took Joyce&#x27;s necklace, as well as Johnny&#x27;s wallet and Timex watch—the same brand watch found at the Cheri Jo Bates crime scene, and assumed to belong to Bates&#x27; killer.

Johnny&#x27;s mother said she could not think of him having any enemies. His sister theorized the Zodiac may have been the culprit. Police investigated a 51-year-old man living in a nearby beach shack, a teenager alleged by a priest to be violent, and a 19-year-old Marine from San Diego who killed his parents and sister in Illinois. Police speculated that the Swindles were victims of a &quot;thrill killer&quot;, and they also saw a parallel with the Domingos and Edwards murders. In both the Santa Barbara and Ocean Beach killings, the victims were shot from a distance, then again at close range. Both the Ocean Beach and Lake Herman Road murders used a .22 Remington Arms Model 550-1 rifle, but the ballistics did not match between the cartridges found at the two scenes. The San Diego Reader noted that the murders at Lake Berryessa, Santa Barbara, and Ocean Beach were all near bodies of water.

=== Cheri Jo Bates ===
On October 30, 1966, Cheri Jo Bates, an 18-year-old student at Riverside City College (RCC), spent the evening at the campus library annex until it closed at 9:00 p.m. Neighbors reported hearing a scream around 10:30. Her father reported her missing, and she was found dead the next morning at 6:30 a.m. She was found a short distance from the library, between two abandoned houses slated to be demolished for campus renovations. She had been brutally beaten and stabbed to death. The wires in her Volkswagen&#x27;s distributor cap had been pulled out. A man&#x27;s paint-spattered Timex watch with a torn wristband was found nearby. The watch stopped at 12:24, but police believe that the attack had occurred much earlier.

One month later, on November 29, nearly identical typewritten letters were mailed to Riverside police and the &quot;Riverside Press-Enterprise&quot;, titled &quot;The Confession.&quot; The author claimed responsibility for the Bates murder, providing details of the crime that were not released to the public. The author warned that Bates &quot;is not the first and she will not be the last.&quot;

In December 1966, a macabre poem was discovered carved into the bottom side of a desktop in the RCC library. Titled &quot;Sick of living/unwilling to die,&quot; the poem&#x27;s language and handwriting resembled that of the Zodiac&#x27;s letters. It was signed with what were assumed to be a set of lowercase initials (&quot;r h&quot;) inscribed below. During the 1970 investigation, Sherwood Morrill, California&#x27;s top &quot;questioned documents&quot; examiner, expressed his opinion that the poem was written by the Zodiac.

On March 13, 1971, five months after Avery&#x27;s article linking the Zodiac to the Bates murder, the Zodiac mailed a letter to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. In the letter, he credited the police, instead of Avery, for discovering his &quot;Riverside activity, but they are only finding the easy ones, there are a hell of a lot more down there.&quot; The connection between Bates and the Zodiac remains uncertain.

===Enedine Molina and Fermin Rodriguez===
On June 8, 1967, Enedine Molina (35) and Fermin Rodriguez (36) were parked on Vallecitos Road in Alameda County. A stranger approached and told them to get out of the car. Rodriguez was fatally shot and Molina was abducted. The killer stopped near Sunol Regional Wilderness. Molina tried to escape and was killed. Rape and robbery were ruled out as motives. The murders occurred near Pleasanton. The March 1971 to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was postmarked in Pleasanton.

===John Franklin Hood and Sandra Garcia===

On February 21, 1970, John Franklin Hood (24) and his fiancée, Sandra Garcia (20), visited East Beach in Santa Barbara. The couple left their Santa Barbara home at 6 p.m. Early the following day, their fully-clothed bodies were discovered under their blanket. Hood was stabbed eleven times, mainly in the face and back. Garcia received the brunt of the vicious attack, leaving her almost unrecognizable. The bone-handled 4&quot; fish knife used in their murder was partially buried in the sand beneath the blanket. There appeared to be no sexual interference, and robbery was ruled out. The double-murder was similar to the 1963 killing of Domingos and Edwards, thirty miles west. It also paralleled the 1969 Lake Berryessa attack.

=== Kathleen Johns ===
On the night of March 22, 1970, Kathleen Johns (22) was driving to Petaluma with her 10-month-old daughter. Johns was also seven months pregnant. She left San Bernardino at 4:30 p.m. At 11:30 p.m. on Highway 132 near Patterson, a vehicle behind her blinked its lights. A man pulled alongside and convinced her to pull over because her left rear wheel was loose. He fixed it, but when she pulled away it immediately fell off. Johns told Paul Avery that the man offered to drive her to a gas station that was in sight just up the road.

Johns asked the man if he always helped strangers this way. He replied, &quot;By the time I get through with them, they won&#x27;t need my help.&quot; He drove past the gas station and kept Johns captive for two hours. He told her repeatedly, &quot;you know I&#x27;m going to kill you&quot;. When he abruptly stopped, Johns jumped out of the car with her infant and hid in an irrigation ditch. The man searched for her with a flashlight before leaving. A passing farmer drove Johns to a police station in Patterson. When she saw the Wanted poster from Paul Stine&#x27;s murder, she exclaimed, &quot;Oh my god...that&#x27;s him&quot;. Johns car was found in flames on Highway 132. A few months later, the Zodiac referenced this kidnapping in a .

=== Richard Radetich ===
Around 5:25 a.m. on June 19, 1970, SFPD Sergeant Richard Phillip &quot;Rich&quot; Radetich (25) was shot three times by a .38 caliber revolver. He was serving a parking ticket in Haight Ashbury when he was shot through the driver&#x27;s window of his squad car. The SFPD started assigning two officers to every patrol car. A week later, the to have shot a man &quot;in a parked car with a .38&quot;. Police never found direct evidence that Zodiac killed Radetich. In 2004, the SFPD reopened the Radetich investigation.

===Donna Lass===
Registered nurse Donna Lass (25) was last seen on September 6, 1970, in Stateline, Nevada. She worked at the Sahara Tahoe casino until 2:00 a.m. that morning. Her boss and landlord both received phone calls from an anonymous man who claimed Lass had an illness in her family and would not be returning. Her car was parked near her apartment, which was undisturbed.

Paul Avery received several months later with potential connections to Lass&#x27; disappearance. Like the &quot;13-Hole Punch Card&quot;, placed over the original image is a collage of phrases like &quot;Peek through the pines...around in the snow&quot;. It also said, &quot;Sought Victim 12&quot; and included the symbol.

In 1986, the Placer County Sheriff&#x27;s Office located a skull near Emigrant Gap along California State Route 20 in the Sierra Nevada. The South Lake Tahoe Police Department began investigating a connection to the Zodiac killing spree in 2001. DNA profiling determined it was Donna Lass&#x27; skull in 2023.

===Potentially related serial murders===
====Astrological murders====
The &quot;Astrological murders&quot; were committed by a suspected serial killer who was also active in the same region of California and around the same time as the Zodiac. Police across multiple jurisdictions made a tentative connection between a single culprit and at least a dozen unsolved homicides that occurred between the late 1960s and early &#x27;70s. All of the victims were female and were killed in a variety of ways, including strangulation, drowning, throat-cutting, and bludgeoning, occasionally after being drugged. The killings were linked because victims were dumped in ravines and killed in conjunction with astrological events, such as the winter solstice, equinox, and Friday the 13th.

====Santa Rosa hitchhiker murders====
The Zodiac was also suspected of being the perpetrator behind the &quot;Santa Rosa hitchhiker murders&quot;. Between 1972–3, at least seven female hitchhikers were murdered in Sonoma County and Santa Rosa. In the Zodiac&#x27;s January 29, 1974 &quot;Exorcist letter&quot; to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, he claims thirty-seven victims. A symbol in that letter matched Chinese characters on a soy barrel carried by one of the Santa Rosa victims. The Zodiac had warned he would vary his &quot;modus operandi&quot; in , &quot;when I comitt [&quot;sic&quot;] my murders, they shall look like routine robberies, killings of anger, + a few fake accidents, etc.&quot;

One of the main Zodiac suspects, Arthur Leigh Allen, was also suspected of being the Santa Rosa killer.

==21st-century developments==
In April 2004, the SFPD cited caseload pressure and marked the Zodiac case &quot;inactive.&quot; By March 2007, they reactivated the case. The case remains open in Riverside and Napa County. 

In 2018, the Vallejo Police Department attempted to use GEDmatch to catch the Zodiac. They did not receive definitive results. The FBI&#x27;s investigation was still ongoing as of 2020.

== Suspects ==
In 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the SFPD had investigated an estimated 2,500 Zodiac suspects, and only a half-dozen of them were seen as credible by the department. Richard Grinell, who runs the website Zodiac Ciphers, stated in 2022 that &quot;there are probably 50 or 100 suspects named every year.&quot;

The only man ever named by the police as a suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen, a former elementary school teacher and convicted sex offender who died in 1992. Allen denied being the Zodiac. He was interviewed by police from the early days of the investigation, and was subject to several related search warrants over a twenty-year period. In 2007, Graysmith said that several detectives described Allen as the most likely suspect. In 2010, Toschi stated that all the evidence against Allen ultimately &quot;turned out to be negative.&quot; Other suspects widely seen as viable by professional or amateur investigators include Earl Van Best Jr., Gary Francis Poste, Giuseppe Bevilacqua, Lawrence Kane, Paul Doerr, Richard Gaikowski, and Richard Marshall.

==Legacy==

In 2020, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; called the Zodiac case &quot;the most famous unsolved murder case in American history.&quot; The unusual nature of the spree has sustained international interest for years. A cottage industry of &quot;Zodiologists&quot; sprung up in the wake of the killings. They try to solve the case and have informal annual meetings. Several websites collect information about the crimes and ciphers.

Dozens of books and documentaries have focused on the Zodiac. The original and most influential amateur book was Robert Graysmith&#x27;s &quot;Zodiac&quot; (1986). He was working at the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; as a cartoonist while the Zodiac was corresponding with the paper. Graysmith compiled his research into an authoritative investigation that remains a touchstone for other researchers. John Bowman published the book The Allen Files, containing Arthur Leigh Allen&#x27;s military records. That was followed with, Zodiac Killer - Fact Vs. Fiction.

Theories about the Zodiac&#x27;s identity are rampant. In &quot;Zodiac&quot;, Graysmith refers to Arthur Leigh Allen as &quot;Robert Hall Starr&quot; to protect his identity and avoid litigation. In 2002, Graysmith wrote directly about Allen in &quot;Zodiac Unmasked&quot;. Attributing victims to the Zodiac is also a popular pastime. One Zodiologist has persistently claimed to also be a target of the killer. Since 2013, accusing United States Senator Ted Cruz of being the Zodiac has been a popular Internet meme.

The Zodiac inspired copycat killers like Heriberto Seda in New York City and Shinichiro Azuma in Japan, both of whom called themselves &quot;the Zodiac&quot;. In 2021, an anonymous author sent letters to media outlets in Albany using a &quot;Chinese Zodiac Killer&quot; sobriquet.

===Popular culture===
The first film about the Zodiac Killer was produced two years after his last confirmed murder during his letter-writing campaign. Tom Hanson&#x27;s &quot;The Zodiac Killer&quot; was made as a scheme to capture the culprit. The film premiered on April 19, 1971, at the Golden Gate Theater in San Francisco. The audience were given a survey with the prompt, &quot;I think the Zodiac kills because...&quot; They were asked to complete the sentence and promised the best response would be rewarded with a Kawasaki motorcycle. The audience surveys were secretly compared to the Zodiac&#x27;s handwriting. Hanson hoped the killer&#x27;s supposed egotism would lure him to the movie, and deployed volunteers to detain anyone whose handwriting matched the Zodiac&#x27;s. The scheme lasted for several screenings, and in one, the volunteers actually confronted one potential suspect and held the suspect before releasing him due to lack of evidence.

The Zodiac has inspired villains in multiple movies, including Scorpio in &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; (1971), the Gemini Killer in &quot;The Exorcist III&quot; (1990), John Doe in &quot;Seven&quot; (1995), and the Riddler in &quot;The Batman&quot; (2022). 

The Zodiac case is the subject of the film &quot;Zodiac&quot; (2007), directed by &quot;David Fincher&quot;, who also directed &quot;Seven&quot;. Fincher grew up in the Bay Area during the Zodiac killings. The film was an adaptation of Robert Graysmith&#x27;s books, focusing on Graysmith and Paul Avery&#x27;s investigation over 23 years. The filmmakers extensively researched the case, conducting interviews with people involved in the case. The film posits Arthur Leigh Allen&#x27;s culpability and led to more public interest in the Zodiac.

<doc id="255198" wikidata="Q587419" url="?curid=255198" title="Notorious (1946 film)">
<text>Notorious is a 1946 American spy film noir directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains as three people whose lives become intimately entangled during an espionage operation.

The film follows U.S. government agent T. R. Devlin (Grant), who enlists the help of Alicia Huberman (Bergman), the daughter of a German war criminal, to infiltrate a circle of executives of IG Farben hiding out in Rio de Janeiro after World War II. The situation becomes complicated when the two fall in love as Huberman is instructed to seduce Alex Sebastian (Rains), a Farben executive who had previously been infatuated with her. It was shot in late 1945 and early 1946, and was released by RKO Radio Pictures in August 1946.

&quot;Notorious&quot; is considered by critics and scholars to mark a watershed for Hitchcock artistically, and to represent a heightened thematic maturity. His biographer, Donald Spoto, writes that &quot;&quot;Notorious&quot; is in fact Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s first attempt—at the age of forty-six—to bring his talents to the creation of a serious love story, and its story of two men in love with Ingrid Bergman could only have been made at this stage of his life.&quot; In 2006, &quot;Notorious&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Plot ==

In April 1946, Alicia Huberman, the American daughter of a convicted Nazi spy, is recruited by government agent T. R. Devlin to infiltrate an organization of Nazis who have escaped to Brazil after World War II. When Alicia refuses to help the authorities, Devlin plays recordings of her fighting with her father and insisting that she loves the United States.
While awaiting the details of her assignment in Rio de Janeiro, Alicia and Devlin fall in love, though his feelings are complicated by his knowledge of her promiscuous past. When Devlin receives instructions to persuade her to seduce Alex Sebastian, one of her father&#x27;s friends and a leading member of the Farben executives, Devlin fails to convince his superiors that Alicia is not fit for the job. Devlin is also informed that Sebastian was once in love with Alicia. Devlin puts up a stoic front when he informs Alicia about the mission. Alicia infers, mistakenly, that he was merely pretending to love her as part of his job.

Devlin contrives to have Alicia meet Sebastian at a riding club. He recognizes her and invites her to dinner where he says that he always knew they would be reunited. Sebastian quickly invites Alicia to a dinner party the following night at his home, where he will host a few business acquaintances. Devlin and Captain Paul Prescott of the U.S. Secret Service instruct Alicia to memorize the names and nationalities of everyone there. At dinner, Alicia notices that a guest becomes agitated at the sight of a certain wine bottle, and is ushered quickly from the room. When the gentlemen are alone at the end of the dinner, this guest apologizes and tries to go home, but another insists on driving him, implying that he will kill him.

Alicia soon reports to Devlin, &quot;You can add Sebastian&#x27;s name to my list of playmates.&quot; Later, Alicia informs Devlin and Prescott that Sebastian has proposed to her. Disappointed by Devlin&#x27;s indifference, she marries Sebastian.
After returning from her honeymoon, Alicia tells Devlin that the key ring her husband gave her lacks the key to the wine cellar. Devlin suggests that Alicia throw a grand party and invite him, so he can investigate. Alicia secretly steals the key from Sebastian&#x27;s ring, and Devlin and Alicia search the cellar. Devlin accidentally breaks a bottle; inside is black sand, later proven to be uranium ore. Devlin takes a sample, cleans up, and locks the door. As Sebastian comes down for more champagne, Devlin kisses Alicia to create a distraction. Alicia insists to Sebastian that Devlin is drunk and that she brought him down to the cellar to prevent him from making an embarrassing scene in front of the party guests.

Sebastian realizes that the cellar key is missing from his key ring, but the next morning, he finds that Alicia has reattached it during the night. Returning to the cellar, he finds the glass and sand from the broken bottle. Sebastian knows he must silence Alicia, but cannot expose her without revealing his own blunder to the rest of the Nazi emigrés, who will kill him if they learn that he has married an American agent. Sebastian discusses the situation with his mother, who suggests that Alicia &quot;die slowly&quot; by poisoning. They poison her coffee and she soon falls ill. Her illness worsens until she collapses and is taken to her room, where the telephone has been removed. Too weak to leave, she perceives that her husband is slowly poisoning her to death.

Devlin, alarmed by Alicia&#x27;s continuing absence, sneaks into Alicia&#x27;s room, where she tells him that Sebastian and his mother are poisoning her. Shaken by Alicia&#x27;s peril, he finally confesses his love for her, and carries her out of the mansion in full view of Sebastian&#x27;s co-conspirators. Sebastian and his mother go along with Devlin&#x27;s story that Alicia must go to the hospital, but the conspirators are not convinced. Outside, Sebastian begs Devlin and Alicia to take him with them, but they contemptuously drive away, leaving him behind to suffer a grim fate at the hands of his fellow Nazis.

== Cast ==
== Cast notes ==
Biographer Patrick McGilligan writes that &quot;Hitchcock rarely managed to pull together a dream cast for any of his 1940s films, but &quot;Notorious&quot; was a glorious exception.&quot; Indeed, with a story of smuggled uranium as a backdrop, &quot;[t]he romantic pairing of Grant and Bergman promised a box office bang comparable to an atomic blast.&quot;

Not everyone saw it that way, however, most notably the project&#x27;s original producer David O. Selznick. After he sold the property to RKO to raise some quick cash, Selznick lobbied hard to get Grant replaced with Joseph Cotten. The U.S. had just dropped atomic bombs on Japan; Selznick argued that the first film out about atomic weaponry would be the most successful and Grant was not available for three months. Selznick also believed Grant would be difficult to manage and make high salary demands, but most telling of all—Selznick owned Cotten&#x27;s contract. Hitchcock and RKO production executive William Dozier invoked a clause in the project sale contract and blocked Selznick&#x27;s attempts; Grant was signed to play opposite Bergman by late August 1945.

Hitchcock had wanted Clifton Webb to play Alexander Sebastian. Selznick pressed for Claude Rains in typical Selznick memo-heavy style: &quot;Rains offers &#x27;an opportunity to build the gross of &quot;Notorious&quot; enormously... . [D]o not lose a day trying to get the Rains&#x27; deal nailed down. Whether they were thinking in Selznick&#x27;s box office terms or in more artistic ones, Dozier and Hitchcock agreed, and Rains&#x27; performance transformed Sebastian into a classic Hitchcock villain: sympathetic, nuanced, in some ways as admirable as the protagonist.

The final major casting decision was Mme. Sebastian, Alex&#x27;s mother. &quot;The spidery, tyrannical Nazi matron demanded a stronger, older presence&quot;, and when attempts to obtain Ethel Barrymore and Mildred Natwick fell through, German actor Reinhold Schünzel suggested Leopoldine Konstantin to Hitchcock and Dozier. Konstantin had been one of pre-war Germany&#x27;s greatest actresses. &quot;Notorious&quot; was Konstantin&#x27;s only American film appearance, and &quot;one of the unforgettable portraits in Hitchcock&#x27;s films&quot;.

Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo appearance, a signature occurrence in his films, takes place at the party in Sebastian&#x27;s mansion. At 1:04:43 (1:01:50 on European DVDs and 64:28 of the edited cut) into the film, Hitchcock is seen drinking a glass of champagne as Grant and Bergman approach. He sets his glass down and quickly departs.

== Production ==

=== Pre-production ===
&quot;Notorious&quot; started life as a David O. Selznick production, but by the time it hit American screens in August 1946, it bore the RKO studio&#x27;s logo. Alfred Hitchcock became the producer, but as on all his subsequent films, he limited his screen credits to &quot;Directed by&quot; and his possessive credit above the title.

Its first glimmer occurred some two years previously, in August 1944, over lunch between Hitchcock and Selznick&#x27;s story editor, Margaret McDonell. Her memo to Selznick said that Hitchcock was &quot;very anxious to do a story about confidence tricks on a grand scale [with] Ingrid Bergman [as] the woman ... Her training would be as elaborate as the training of a Mata Hari.&quot; Hitchcock continued his conversation a few weeks later, this time dining at Chasen&#x27;s with William Dozier, an RKO studio executive, and pitching it as &quot;the story of a woman sold for political purposes into sexual enslavement&quot;. By this time, he had one of the single-word titles he preferred: &quot;Notorious&quot;. The pitch was convincing: Dozier quickly entered into talks with Selznick, offering to buy the property and its personnel for production at RKO.

Dozier&#x27;s interest rekindled Selznick&#x27;s, which up to that point had only been tepid. Perhaps what started Hitchcock&#x27;s mind rolling was &quot;The Song of the Dragon&quot;, a short story by John Taintor Foote which had appeared as a two-part serial in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; in November 1921; Selznick, who owned the rights to it, had passed it on to Hitchcock from his unproduced story file during the filming of &quot;Spellbound&quot;. Set during World War I in New York, &quot;The Song of the Dragon&quot; told the tale of a theatrical producer approached by federal agents, who want his assistance in recruiting an actress he once had a relationship with to seduce the leader of a gang of enemy saboteurs. Although the story was a nominal starting point that &quot;offered some inspiration, the final narrative was pure Hitchcock&quot;.

Hitchcock travelled to England for Christmas 1944, and when he returned, he had an outline for Selznick&#x27;s perusal. The producer approved development of a script, and Hitchcock decamped for Nyack, New York, for three weeks of collaboration with Ben Hecht, whom he had just worked with on &quot;Spellbound&quot;. The two would work at Hecht&#x27;s house, with Hitchcock repairing at night to the St. Regis New York. The two had an extraordinarily smooth and fruitful working partnership, partly because Hecht did not really care how much Hitchcock rewrote his work:

Hitchcock delivered his and Hecht&#x27;s screenplay to Selznick in late March, but the producer was getting drawn deeper into the roiling problems of his western epic &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot;. At first he ordered story conferences at his home, typically with start times of 11 p.m., to both Hecht&#x27;s and Hitchcock&#x27;s profound annoyance. The two would dine at Romanoff&#x27;s and &quot;pool their defenses about what Hitchcock thought was a first class script&quot;. Shortly, though, &quot;Duel&quot;″s problems won out and Selznick relegated &quot;Notorious&quot; to his mental back burner.

Among the many changes to the original story was the introduction of a MacGuffin: a cache of uranium being held in Sebastian&#x27;s wine cellar by the Nazis. At the time, it was not common knowledge that uranium was being used in the development of the atomic bomb, and Selznick had trouble understanding its use as a plot device. Indeed, Hitchcock later claimed he was followed by the FBI for several months after he and Hecht discussed uranium with Robert Millikan at the California Institute of Technology in mid-1945. In any event, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and the release of details of the Manhattan Project, removed any doubts about its use.
By June 1945, &quot;Notorious&quot; reached its turning point. Selznick &quot;was losing faith in a film that never really interested him&quot;; the MacGuffin still bothered him, as did the Devlin character, and he worried that audiences would dislike the Alicia character. More worrisome, though, was the drain on his cash reserves imposed by the voracious &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot;. Finally, he agreed to sell the &quot;Notorious&quot; package to RKO: script, Bergman and Hitchcock.

The deal was a win–win–win situation: Selznick got $800,000 cash, plus 50% of the profits, RKO obtained a prestige production with an ascendant star and an emerging director, and Hitchcock, though he received no money, did escape from under Selznick&#x27;s stifling thumb. He also got to be his own producer for the first time, an important step for him: &quot;supervising everything from the polishing of the script to the negotiation of myriad post-production details, the director could demonstrate to the industry at large his skill as an executive.&quot; RKO assumed the project in mid-July 1945, and furnished office space, studio space, distribution—and freedom.

There was no getting away from Selznick completely, though. He contended that his 50% stake in the profits still entitled him to input into the project. He still dictated sheaves of memos about the script, and tried to oust Cary Grant from the cast in favor of his contractee, Joseph Cotten. When the United States detonated two atomic bombs over Japan in August, the memos commenced anew and centered mainly on Selznick&#x27;s continuing dissatisfaction with the script. Hitchcock was abroad, so Dozier called on playwright Clifford Odets, who previously wrote &quot;None but the Lonely Heart&quot; for RKO and Grant, to do a rewrite. With Hitchcock and Selznick both busy, Selznick&#x27;s script assistant Barbara Keon would be his only contact.

Odets&#x27;s script tried to bring more atmosphere to the story than had previously been present. &quot;Extending the characters&#x27; emotional range, he heightened the passion of Devlin and Alicia and the aristocratic ennui of Alex Sebastian. He also added a soupçon of high culture to soften Alicia: She quotes French poetry from memory and sings Schubert.&quot; However, his draft did nothing for Selznick, who still thought the characters lacked dimension, that Devlin still lacked charm, and that the couple&#x27;s sleeping together &quot;may cheapen her in the eyes of the audience&quot;. Ben Hecht&#x27;s appraisal, handwritten in the margin, was straightforward: &quot;This is really loose crap.&quot; In the end, the Odets script was a blind alley: Hitchcock apparently used none of it.

What he &quot;did&quot; have in his hand, though, was the script for &quot;... a consummate Hitchcock film, in every sense filled with passion and textures and levels of meaning&quot;.

=== Production ===
Principal photography for &quot;Notorious&quot; began on October 22, 1945, and wrapped in February 1946. Production was structured the way Hitchcock preferred it: with almost all shooting done indoors, on RKO sound stages, even seeming &quot;exterior&quot; scenes achieved with rear projection process shots. This gave him maximum control of his filmmaking through the day; in the evenings he exercised similar control over the nightly soirées at his Bellagio Road home. The only scene requiring outdoor filming was the one at the riding club where Devlin and Alicia contrive to meet Alexander Sebastian on horseback; this scene was shot at the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden in Arcadia, California. Second unit crews shot establishing exteriors and rear-projection footage in Miami, Rio de Janeiro and at the Santa Anita Park racetrack.

With everything stage-bound, production was smooth and problems were few, and small—for instance, Claude Rains, who stood three or four inches shorter than Ingrid Bergman. &quot;[There&#x27;s] this business of you being a midget with a wife, Miss Bergman, who is very tall&quot;, the director kidded with Rains, a good friend. For the scenes where Rains and Bergman were to walk hand-in-hand, Hitchcock devised a system of ramps that boosted Rains&#x27;s height yet were unseen by the camera. He also suggested Rains try elevator shoes: &quot;Walk in them, sleep in them, be comfortable in them.&quot; Rains did, and used them thereafter. Hitchcock gave Rains the choice of playing Sebastian with a German or his English accent; Rains chose the latter.

Ingrid Bergman&#x27;s gowns were by Edith Head, in one of her many collaborations with Hitchcock.
One of the signature scenes in &quot;Notorious&quot; is the two-and-a-half-minute kiss that Hitchcock interrupted every three seconds to slip the scene through the three-second-rule crack in the Production Code. &quot;The two stars worried about how strange it felt&quot;, writes biographer McGilligan. &quot;Walking along, nuzzling each other with the camera trailing behind them, seemed &#x27;very awkward&#x27; to the actors during filming, according to Bergman. &#x27;Don&#x27;t worry&#x27;, Hitchcock assured her. &#x27;It&#x27;ll look right on the screen.

Although the production proceeded smoothly it was not without some unusual aspects. The first was the helpfulness of Cary Grant toward Ingrid Bergman, in a way that &quot;was remarkably calm and pointedly unusual for him&quot;. Although this was Bergman&#x27;s second outing with Hitchcock (the first was the just-finished &quot;Spellbound&quot;), she was nervous and insecure early on. The often moody, sometimes withdrawn Grant, though, &quot;came to &quot;Notorious&quot; full of bounce&quot; and coached her through her initial period of adjustment, rehearsing her the way Devlin rehearses Alicia. This began a lifetime friendship for the two.

There were two passionate turmoils going on on-set, and both served to inform the final product: one was Hitchcock&#x27;s growing infatuation with Bergman, and the other was her torturous affair with Robert Capa, the celebrity battlefield photographer. As a result of this simpatico connection, and &quot;to accomplish the deepest logic of &quot;Notorious&quot;, Hitchcock did something unprecedented in his career: he made Ingrid his closest collaborator on the picture&quot;:

When production wrapped in February 1946, Hitchcock had in the can what François Truffaut later told him &quot;gets a maximum of effect from a minimum of elements ... Of all your pictures, this is the one in which one feels the most perfect correlation between what you are aiming at and what appears on the screen ... To the eye, the ensemble is as perfect as an animated cartoon ...&quot;
=== Music ===
The music for &quot;Notorious&quot; is the least celebrated of the major Hitchcock scores, writes film scholar Jack Sullivan, one that few writers or fans talk about. &quot;The neglect is unfortunate, for Roy Webb composed one of the most deftly designed scores of any Hitchcock film. It weaves a unique spell, one Hitchcock had not conjured before, and the hip, swingy source music is novel as well.&quot;

The composer was Roy Webb, a staff composer at RKO, who had most recently scored the dark films of director Val Lewton for that studio. He wrote the fight song for Columbia University while he was there in the 1920s, then served as assistant to film composer Max Steiner until 1935; his reputation was &quot;reliable, but unglamorous&quot;. Hitchcock had tried to get Bernard Herrmann for &quot;Notorious&quot;, but Herrmann was unavailable; Webb too was a Herrmann fan: &quot;Benny writes the best music in Hollywood, with the fewest notes&quot;, he said.

Before the sale of the property to RKO, Selznick attempted, with typical Selznick gusto, to steer the course of the music. He was miffed that no hit pop song had come out of his previous Hitchcock picture &quot;Spellbound&quot;, so he considered eighteen &quot;gooey, sentimental songs&quot; like &quot;Love Nest&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Any More Beer to My Father&quot; and &quot;In a Little Love Nest Way Up on a Hill&quot; for inclusion in &quot;Notorious&quot;. However, the sale removed Selznick as the decision-maker.

Hitchcock was glad to be out from under Selznick&#x27;s thumb. There would be &quot;no sudsy violins in big love scenes, no more recycling of Selznick&#x27;s favorite cues from past movies. He made sure there were no south-of-the-border cliches.&quot; Selznick&#x27;s exit also brought Hitchcock and Webb together into their natural sympatico. &quot;Selznick deplored &#x27;Hitchcock&#x27;s goddamned jigsaw cutting&#x27;, the dreamlike, jagged images that create his signature subjectivity. But Webb didn&#x27;t mind jigsaw cutting at all. It complemented his fragmented musical architecture, just as the blocked passions of the film&#x27;s characters reflect his unresolved harmonies. Like Hitchcock, Webb favored atmosphere and tonal nuance over broad gestures. Both men were classicists dealing in darkness and chaos.&quot; They featured complementary personalities, too: &quot;Webb had a modest ego, a handy trait when working for a control addict like Hitchcock.&quot; &quot;Notorious&quot; was, however, their only film together.

Alicia and Devlin fall quickly in love once they arrive in Rio, and Webb uses tambourines, guitars, drums and Brazilian trumpets swinging into Brazilian dance music to provide &quot;sensuous foreplay for the tumultuous love affair&quot;. Numbers include &quot;Carnaval no Rio&quot;, &quot;Meu Barco&quot;, &quot;Guanabara&quot; and two sambas &quot;Ya Ya Me Leva&quot; and &quot;Bright Samba&quot;. Yet understatement and atypical use are everywhere:

Often, Webb and Hitchcock use no music at all to undergird a romantic scene. The two-and-a-half minute kiss begins with distant music when it commences out on the balcony, but goes silent when the couple move inside. Other times, they flout conventional wisdom: when Alicia asks the band to stop playing stuffy waltzes and liven things up with Brazilian music to cover her trip to the wine cellar with Devlin, Latin dance tunes replace the expected suspense cue.

Aspects of Hitchcockian humor are present: When Alicia first enters the Sebastian mansion, loaded with sinister Nazis, Schumann is playing. &quot;Wicked they may be, but these terrorists have artistic sensibilities and impeccable taste.&quot;

=== Cinematography ===
Roger Ebert described &quot;Notorious&quot; as having &quot;some of the most effective camera shots in his—or anyone&#x27;s—work&quot;. Hitchcock played off Grant&#x27;s star power in his first scene, introducing his character with shots of the back of the actor&#x27;s head showing him observing Alicia carefully. The excess of her drinking is reinforced the next morning with a close-up and zoom out from a glass of fizzing aspirin beside her bed. The camera switches to her point of view and the viewer sees Grant as Devlin, backlit and upside down. The film also contains a tracking shot at Sebastian&#x27;s mansion in Rio de Janeiro: starting high above the entrance hall, the camera tracks all the way down to Alicia&#x27;s hand, showing her nervously twisting the key there.

== Themes and motifs ==
The predominant theme in &quot;Notorious&quot; is trust—trust withheld, or given too freely. T. R. Devlin is a long time finding his trust, while Alexander Sebastian offers his up easily—and ultimately pays a big price for it. Likewise, the film addresses a woman&#x27;s need to be trusted, and a man&#x27;s need to open himself to love.

Hitchcock the raconteur positioned it in terms of classic conflict. He told Truffaut that:

Sullivan writes that Devlin sets up Alicia as sexual bait, refuses to take any responsibility for his role, then feels devastated when she does a superb job. Alicia finds herself coldly manipulated by the man she loves, sees her notorious behavior exploited for political purposes, then fears abandonment by the lover who put her in the excruciating predicament of spying on her late father&#x27;s Nazi colleague by sleeping with him—a man who genuinely loves her, perhaps more than Devlin does. Alex is Hitchcock&#x27;s most painfully sympathetic villain, driven by his profound jealousy and rage—not to mention his enthrallment to an emasculating mother—culminating in an abrupt, absolute imperative to kill the love of his life.
Hitchcock&#x27;s own mother had died in September 1942, and &quot;Notorious&quot; is the first time he addresses his mother issues head-on. &quot;In &quot;Notorious&quot;, the role of mother is at last fully introduced and examined. No longer relegated to mere conversation, she appears here as a major character in a Hitchcock picture, and all at once—as later, through &quot;Psycho, The Birds&quot; and &quot;Marnie&quot;—Hitchcock began to make the mother figure a personal repository of his anger, guilt, resentment, and a sad yearning.&quot; At the same time, he blurred mother-love with erotic love, and poignantly, in both the film and in its director&#x27;s life, &quot;both kinds of love were in fact limited to longing and fantasy and unfulfilled expectations&quot;.

The theme of drinking weaves its way through the film from beginning to end: for Alicia it is an escape from guilt and pain, or even downright poisonous. When a guest at the opening party tells her she has had enough, she scoffs: &quot;The &quot;important&quot; drinking hasn&#x27;t started yet.&quot; She camouflages emotional rejection with whiskey, at the opening party, the outdoor cafe in Rio, the apartment in Rio, then drinking becomes even more dangerous as the Sebastians administer their poison through Alicia&#x27;s coffee. Even the MacGuffin comes packaged in a wine bottle. &quot;All the drinking is valueless and finally dangerous.&quot;

Coming as it did on the heels of World War II, the theme of patriotism—and the limits thereof—makes it &quot;astonishing that the movie was produced at all (and that it was such an immediate success), since it contains such blunt dialogue about government-sponsored prostitution: The sexual blackmail is the idea of American intelligence agents, who are blithely willing to exploit a woman (and even to let her die) to serve their own ends. The depiction of the moral murkiness of American officials was unprecedented in Hollywood—especially in 1945, when the Allied victory ushered in an era of understandable, but ultimately dangerous, chauvinism in American life.&quot;

&quot;Notorious&quot; is notable among Hitchcock&#x27;s films in that even though it is a spy thriller involving assassinations and attempts at assassination, no physical violence at all is shown on screen, except for the serving of poisoned coffee, and occasional gentle slaps.

== Reception ==
The film was the official selection of the 1946 Cannes Film Festival. &quot;Notorious&quot; had its premiere at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on August 15, 1946, with Hitchcock, Bergman, and Grant in attendance.

===Box office===
The film made $4.85 million in theatrical rentals in the United States and Canada on its first release, making it one of the highest-grossing films of the year. Overseas, it earned $2.3 million, for worldwide rentals of $7.15 million, generating RKO a profit of $1.01 million.

===Critical response===
 As of April 2024, &quot;Notorious&quot; is one of 14 films with a score of 100 (perfect) on the website (two other Hitchcock films, &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;Rear Window&quot;, are also on the list).

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther praised the film, writing, &quot;Mr. Hecht has written, and Mr. Hitchcock has directed in brilliant style, a romantic melodrama which is just about as thrilling as they come—velvet smooth in dramatic action, sharp and sure in its characters, and heavily charged with the intensity of warm emotional appeal.&quot; Leslie Halliwell, usually terse, almost glowed about &quot;Notorious&quot;: &quot;Superb romantic suspenser containing some of Hitchcock&#x27;s best work.&quot; Decades later, Roger Ebert also praised the film, adding it to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list and calling it &quot;the most elegant expression of the master&#x27;s visual style&quot;. &quot;Notorious&quot; was Patricia Hitchcock O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s favorite of her father&#x27;s pictures. &quot;What a perfect film!&quot;, she told her father&#x27;s biographer, Charlotte Chandler. &quot;The more I see &quot;Notorious&quot;, the more I like it.&quot;

===Accolades===
At the 19th Academy Awards, Claude Rains was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, and Ben Hecht was nominated for Writing Original Screenplay.

Film critic Roger Ebert included &quot;Notorious&quot; on his &quot;Ten Greatest Films of All Time&quot; list in 1991, citing it as his favorite of Hitchcock&#x27;s films. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted it at 66 on their list of &quot;The Greatest Films of All Time&quot; in 1999. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked &quot;Notorious&quot; at No. 77 in its Top 250 &quot;Best Films of the Century&quot; list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. In 2005, Hecht&#x27;s screenplay was voted by the Writers Guild of America as one of the 101 best ever written. The following year, &quot;Notorious&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

American Film Institute included the film at No. 38 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills and at No. 86 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions. &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed it among the &quot;All-Time 100 Movies&quot; (a list of the greatest films since the magazine&#x27;s inception) as chosen by Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel. The film was voted at No. 38 on the list of &quot;100 Greatest Films&quot; by French magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; in 2008. &quot;Notorious&quot; was ranked 68th in BBC&#x27;s 2015 list of &quot;The 100 Greatest American Films&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine ranked the film at No. 34 on their list of &quot;The 100 Best Thriller Films of All Time&quot;.

=== Tribute to Hitchcock ===
On March 7, 1979, the American Film Institute honored Hitchcock with its Life Achievement Award. At the tribute dinner, Ingrid Bergman presented him with the original ÚNICA key to the wine cellar—the single most notable prop in &quot;Notorious&quot;. After filming had ended, Cary Grant had kept it. A few years later he gave the key to Bergman, saying that it had given him luck and hoped it would do the same for her. When presenting it to Hitchcock, to his surprise and delight, she expressed the hope that it would be lucky for him as well.

== Adaptations ==

* The silent film &quot;Convoy&quot; (1927), co-produced by Victor Halperin, was based on the same &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; story.
* A &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; adaptation was broadcast on January 26, 1948, with Ingrid Bergman reprising her role as Alicia Huberman and Joseph Cotten taking Cary Grant&#x27;s role of T. R. Devlin. Another radio adaptation was produced for &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;, again starring Ingrid Bergman, although this time with John Hodiak, and was broadcast on January 6, 1949.
* The film was remade in 1992 as the TV film &quot;Notorious&quot; directed by Colin Bucksey, with John Shea as Devlin, Jenny Robertson as Alicia Velorus, Jean-Pierre Cassel as Sebastian, and Marisa Berenson as Katarina.
* In the animated television series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, the season two episode &quot;Senate Spy&quot; is a &quot;compressed&quot; adaptation of &quot;Notorious&quot;, even going so far as to frame the final shot of the episode the same way as the film.
* &quot;&quot; paid strong homage to &quot;Notorious&quot;, but the plot is about a deadly virus instead of uranium, with the core story, many of the scenes, and some of the dialogue from &quot;Notorious&quot; being used.
* The operatic adaption &quot;Notorious&quot; by Hans Gefors premiered in Gothenburg in September 2015, starring Nina Stemme as Alicia Huberman.

<text>Road Apples is the second studio album by Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip. The album contains the hit singles &quot;Three Pistols&quot;, “Little Bones,” and “Twist My Arm.&quot; During the Hip&#x27;s last tour, in 2016, songs from this album were played live on a regular basis, featuring the above-mentioned songs as well as ”Long Time Running”, “Last of the Unplucked Gems”, “The Luxury”, and “Fiddler&#x27;s Green.” References to many prominent figures were used, including Tom Thomson and Jacques Cousteau, as well as political situations in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The track “Fiddler&#x27;s Green&quot; was written for Gord Downie&#x27;s young nephew, who died during the writing of the album. Because of the personal nature of the song, the Hip did not play it live often, but they played it on a regular basis during their final tour.

Recording sessions were held at the Daniel Lanois&#x27; personal studio in New Orleans in September 1990 on the recommendation of Colin Cripps, at the time a member of the band Crash Vegas. He said that the studio had helped establish the mood for the album &quot;Red Earth&quot;.

==Title==
The name of the album is a Canadian slang term for horse droppings; with allusion to the fact that along the side of a road they can be found in shape and size of apples. The album&#x27;s original working title was &quot;Saskadelphia&quot;, but this was rejected by the record label as likely to confuse listeners; however, the title was later reused for a 2021 EP of previously unreleased rarities from the &quot;Road Apples&quot; sessions.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Road Apples&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album to reach in Canada. The album has been certified Diamond in Canada.

==Deluxe edition==
A deluxe edition of the album was reissued in 2021 to mark its 30th anniversary. The reissue included a remastered version of the original album, the six-song &quot;Saskadelphia&quot; EP, a live concert performance recorded at the Roxy Theatre in 1991, and a disc of outtakes and demo versions of the album&#x27;s songs.

The Roxy Theatre live disc was also separately released as the live album &quot;Live at the Roxy&quot; in 2022.

<doc id="255202" wikidata="Q295345" url="?curid=255202" title="Jaromír Jágr">
<text>Jaromír Jágr (; born 15 February 1972) is a Czech professional ice hockey right winger and owner of Rytíři Kladno of the Czech Extraliga (ELH). He previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Pittsburgh Penguins, Washington Capitals, New York Rangers, Philadelphia Flyers, Dallas Stars, Boston Bruins, New Jersey Devils, Florida Panthers and Calgary Flames, serving as captain of the Penguins and the Rangers, between 1990 and 2008.

After leaving the Rangers in 2008, he played three seasons in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) with Avangard Omsk. He returned to the NHL in 2011 with the Flyers and remained in the league for seven more years before being assigned by the Flames in 2018 to HC Kladno. Having played in 37 professional seasons (as of 2024) and over 2,000 professional games, Jágr has had the longest playing career in professional ice hockey history. He is the most productive European player who has ever played in the NHL and is widely regarded as one of the greatest players ever.

Jágr has the second-most points in NHL history, after Wayne Gretzky. In 1990, at age 18, he was the youngest player in the NHL. Until his transfer, at age 45, he was the oldest player in the NHL and is the oldest player to record a hat-trick. In 2017, Jágr was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history.

Jágr was the fifth overall selection in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft. He won consecutive Stanley Cups in the 1991 and 1992 seasons with the Penguins. Individually, he has won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL scoring champion five times (four times in a row), the Lester B. Pearson Award for the NHL&#x27;s outstanding player as voted by the NHL Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) three times and the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s most valuable player once, while finishing second four times.

Jágr is a member of the Triple Gold Club, individuals who have played for teams that have won the Stanley Cup (1991, 1992), the Ice Hockey World Championships (2005, 2010) and the Olympic gold medal in ice hockey (1998). Jágr is one of only two Czech players (the other being Jiří Šlégr) in the Club, achieving this feat in 2005. Jágr was the Czech Republic&#x27;s flag bearer at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Jágr is also one of only three players from 1981 to 2001 to win the Art Ross Trophy as the leading point-scorer during the regular season; the others are Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux. Jágr has won the award more times than any other non-Canadian player. He has been a member of the Czech Ice Hockey Hall of Fame since 2008 and the IIHF Hall of Fame since 2024.

==Playing career==
===Early career=== 
Jágr began skating at age three, and he immediately showed exceptional abilities. At age 15, he played at the highest level of competition in Czechoslovakia for Poldi SONP Kladno. When he was 17, he became the youngest member of the Czechoslovakia national team.

As a youth in his native country, he kept a photograph of American president Ronald Reagan in his school grade book as a protest against the policies of the Soviet Union.

===Pittsburgh Penguins (1990–2001)===
Jágr was the first Czechoslovak player to be drafted by the NHL without having to defect to the West; his selection in the NHL draft came as the Iron Curtain fell. Because of this, after Jágr was selected by the Pittsburgh Penguins with the fifth overall pick in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft, he was able to relocate to North America from Czechoslovakia immediately. When he attended the draft in Vancouver, he was the first Czechoslovak player present at the NHL draft with his government&#x27;s blessings.

Jágr was a supporting player with the powerhouse Penguins that won back-to-back Stanley Cups in 1991 and 1992. He was one of the youngest players in NHL history, at age 20, to score a goal in the Stanley Cup Finals.

Before he had a clear grasp of the English language, Jágr could be heard reading the daily weather forecast on Pittsburgh radio station WDVE in his broken, thickly-accented English. He and teammate (and fellow countryman) Jiří Hrdina were promoted as the &quot;Czechmates&quot;, a play on the term &quot;checkmate&quot; from chess. He also played Scrabble to increase his English vocabulary. Some Penguins fans realized that the letters in his first name could be scrambled to form the anagram &quot;Mario Jr.&quot;, a reference to teammate Mario Lemieux.

In the 1994–95 season, Jágr won his first Art Ross Trophy after finishing the regular season with the most points in the NHL; he tied Eric Lindros with 70 points but won based on his 32 goals to Lindros&#x27; 29. Jágr set a record for most points, 149, by a European-born player the following year. His 62 goals and 87 assists from that season still stand as career highs. His 1995–96 totals for assists and points stand as the records for right-wingers in those categories. After the 1997–98 season, Penguins captain Ron Francis signed with the Carolina Hurricanes, leaving Jágr the Penguins&#x27; captaincy. From 1997–98 to 2000–01, Jágr would win four straight NHL scoring titles. In 1999, he would win the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player, as well as the Lester B. Pearson Award. In 1998, he led the Czech Republic to a gold medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics.

On 30 December 1999, against the New York Islanders, Jágr scored three goals and four assists for a career-high seven-point night. He would later match this feat on 11 January 2003 by once again scoring three goals and four assists in a game against the Florida Panthers as a member of the Washington Capitals.

In 2000–01, Jágr was struggling to find his scoring touch and faced criticisms about his relationship with Penguins head coach Ivan Hlinka. With the return of Mario Lemieux from retirement, the Penguins had two superstars, but friction developed between the two; Jágr held the captaincy but many fans regarded Lemieux as the talisman of the team. Additionally, the struggling, medium-market Penguins could, with Lemieux back, no longer hope to afford Jágr&#x27;s high salary. Thus, on 11 July 2001, the organization traded him, along with František Kučera, to the Washington Capitals in exchange for Kris Beech, Michal Sivek and Ross Lupaschuk.

In 806 games with Pittsburgh, Jágr became only the second player (after Lemieux) to score 1,000 points as a Penguin. Jágr sits second behind Lemieux in career goals in franchise history and third in games played, assists, and points, having since been surpassed by Sidney Crosby. His no. 68 jersey was eventually retired in a pregame ceremony on 18 February 2024, with Jágr becoming just the third Penguins player to receive the honour.

===Washington Capitals (2001–2004)===
Later in 2001, the Capitals signed Jágr to the then-largest contract in NHL history at $77 million over seven years, an average annual value of $11 million, with an option for an eighth year. However, Jágr did not live up to expectations in Washington, as the Capitals failed to defend their division title and missed the 2002 Stanley Cup playoffs. During his tenure with the Capitals, for the first time in his career Jágr failed to finish among the NHL&#x27;s top scorers, help his team qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs, or make the NHL All-Star team. During the summer of 2002, the Capitals reunited Jágr with former teammate Robert Lang. In 2002–03, Washington finished sixth overall in the Eastern Conference. Still, it lost to the upstart Tampa Bay Lightning in the first round of the 2003 playoffs despite winning the series&#x27; first two games.

The lack of organizational success prompted the Capitals to unload much of their high-priced talent to save money—not just a cost-cutting spree, but also an acknowledgment that their attempt to build a contender with high-priced veteran talent had failed. Disgruntled, Washington ownership spent much of 2003 trying to trade Jágr. Still, a year before a new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) was to be signed, few teams were willing to risk $11 million on Jágr.

On 23 January 2004, Jágr was eventually traded to the New York Rangers in exchange for Anson Carter and an agreement that Washington would pay approximately $4 million per year of Jágr&#x27;s salary. Jágr also agreed to defer (with interest) $1 million per year for the remainder of his contract to allow the trade to go through.

===New York Rangers (2004–2008)===

Due to the new CBA signed before the start of the 2005–06 season, Jágr&#x27;s salary was reduced to $7.8 million, the maximum allowed under the terms of the new salary cap.

During the NHL labor dispute in 2004–05, he played for HC Kladno in the Czech Republic and, afterward, for Avangard Omsk in the Russian Superleague (RSL).

Jágr led the Czech Republic to gold at the 2005 World Hockey Championships in Austria and was elected a tournament all-star. He also became a member of hockey&#x27;s prestigious Triple Gold Club, players who have won a Stanley Cup, a World Hockey Championship and an Olympic gold medal.

Before the 2005–06 season, the Rangers had missed the playoffs for seven consecutive seasons. Following the fire sale of the high-priced, underachieving veterans that made up the team&#x27;s roster (as well as the retirement of long-time captain Mark Messier), many experts picked the Rangers to be the worst team in the NHL. Jágr disagreed and promised the team would surprise many people and make the Stanley Cup playoffs. He started strong during the beginning of the 2005 season and the return from the lockout of the NHL. He became only the fourth player in NHL history to score ten or more goals in less than ten games at the start of a season. His return to dominance helped the Rangers return to the Stanley Cup playoffs, but injuries to Jágr and others contributed to a four-game sweep in the first round by the New Jersey Devils.

Jágr scored his 1,400th point on a power-play goal against the Philadelphia Flyers on 2 March 2006, pushing him past Jari Kurri into second place all-time among European-born players. He later passed Stan Mikita to become the all-time leader.

On 18 March 2006, against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Jágr became only the sixth Rangers player in team history to break the 100-point barrier, and became the only Ranger right winger to score 100 points in a season.

On 27 March 2006, against the Buffalo Sabres, Jágr had a goal and an assist, which tied both the Rangers&#x27; single-season goal record of 52 (Adam Graves, 1993–94) and the Rangers&#x27; single-season points record of 109 (Jean Ratelle, 1971–72). Two nights later, on 29 March, Jágr passed Ratelle when he assisted on Petr Průcha&#x27;s first-period goal against the New York Islanders&#x27; Rick DiPietro. On 8 April, against the Boston Bruins, Jágr scored his NHL-leading 53rd goal of the season, breaking the Rangers&#x27; single-season goals record.
After leading the NHL in points and goals for most of the 2005–06 season, Jágr was surpassed by the San Jose Sharks&#x27; duo of Joe Thornton (125 points) and Jonathan Cheechoo (56 goals), losing both the Art Ross and Maurice Richard trophies in the final week of the season. Jágr finished with 123 points, 54 goals, and 24 power-play goals, second in the NHL in all three categories. He also finished third in the NHL in both assists (69) and plus-minus (+34). However, just as in Washington, playoff success was not to be for Jágr, whose Rangers were swept in four games by New Jersey. In the series, he suffered a dislocated shoulder in the third period of the first game, which kept him from playing at his top form for the rest of the series. Jágr had surgery on the shoulder after the Rangers were eliminated from the playoffs.

Despite being inched out by Joe Thornton for the Art Ross Trophy and Hart Trophy (league MVP), Jágr won his third Lester B. Pearson Award as the NHL&#x27;s most outstanding player. During his acceptance speech for the Award, Jágr said, &quot;With this award, you get voted on by players you play against every night, and I think they understand the game better than the media.&quot; He has been named to seven NHL first All-Star teams.

On 5 October 2006, before the first game of the 2006–07 season (against his former team Washington), Jágr was named as the 24th captain in the history of the New York Rangers, replacing Mark Messier, who had retired before the 2005–06 season. Jágr scored a goal on his first shift in the game, just under 30 seconds into the new season.

Jágr became the 16th player to score 600 career NHL goals on 19 November 2006 against Tampa Bay goaltender Johan Holmqvist. Power play linemate Brendan Shanahan had scored his 600th goal almost three weeks earlier, making them the first teammates in NHL history to score their 600th goal in the same season.

On 10 February 2007, against Washington, Jágr earned an assist on a goal by Michal Rozsíval to record his 1,500th career point. He is only the 12th NHLer to reach this mark and the fourth-fastest player to do so after Marcel Dionne, Mario Lemieux, and Wayne Gretzky.

On 5 April 2007, against the Montreal Canadiens, Jágr scored his 30th goal of the 2006–07 season, tying the NHL record held by Mike Gartner. Thus, Jágr has now scored 30 or more goals in 15 consecutive seasons.

After a regular season slowed by a weak shoulder, Jágr then led the New York Rangers to a sweep of the Atlanta Thrashers in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, the Rangers would fall to the Buffalo Sabres in Game 6 of the Conference Semifinals.

On 14 November 2007, against New Jersey, Jágr scored his fourth goal of the 2007–08 season at the Prudential Center in Newark, making him the first player to score a goal in 53 different NHL arenas.

===Avangard Omsk (2008–2011)===

On 3 July 2008, Jágr, an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his career, was informed by Rangers general manager Glen Sather that the club would not offer him a new contract. Sather admitted that the two sides never engaged in detailed negotiations for a new contract and that after many months of speculation, Jágr was &quot;seriously considering&quot; going to Russia to finish his career despite offers from other NHL teams. Jágr expressed a desire to possibly finish out his career at his father&#x27;s club, HC Kladno. On 4 July, Jágr agreed to a two-year contract with Avangard Omsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL); the contract was reported to pay Jágr the equivalent of US$5 million annually.

Jágr was named Avangard&#x27;s captain on 30 January 2009. As a member of Avangard, Jágr was sitting next to Alexei Cherepanov, a first-round pick of the New York Rangers, who died during a game against Vityaz Chekhov. They were discussing the past shift when the 19-year-old Cherepanov collapsed onto Jágr on the bench at the Ice Hockey Center 2004 in Chekov.

In April 2009, Jágr publicly stated an interest in returning to the NHL, stating that he needed a break from the pressures of an 82-game NHL schedule. Jágr, who claimed to have lost 15 pounds since his last NHL season, and who was &quot;practicing a lot harder than [he] ever did in [his] life&quot;, stated that he would be interested in joining the Edmonton Oilers because of the interest they showed in July 2008. However, following the expiration of his initial contract with Avangard, Jágr signed a new contract with Avangard for the 2010–11 season.

===Philadelphia Flyers (2011–2012)===

On 1 July 2011, Jágr returned to the NHL, but rather than signing with his original NHL team in Pittsburgh, he signed a one-year, $3.3 million contract with the Philadelphia Flyers, the Penguins&#x27; cross-state rival. He scored his 1,600th NHL point during his debut game with the Flyers, assisting on a Claude Giroux goal as the Flyers won their season opener 2–1 over the Boston Bruins on 6 October 2011. Typically playing on the first line with Giroux and Scott Hartnell, Jágr was among the top scorers during the start of the 2011–12 season. He scored his first and second goals as a Flyer on 24 October against the Toronto Maple Leafs. On 29 October 2011, against the Carolina Hurricanes, he scored his 650th and 651st NHL goals. He scored his only goal of the 2012 playoffs during Philadelphia&#x27;s series against Pittsburgh. The Flyers were eliminated by the New Jersey Devils, who would ultimately become the 2012 Eastern Conference champions.

===Dallas Stars (2012–2013)===
On 3 July 2012, Jágr signed a one-year contract with the Dallas Stars reportedly worth $4.5  million. The signing marked Jágr&#x27;s first time playing for a club in the Western Conference. Jágr said during a conference call two days later that the Montreal Canadiens had been his first choice as a free agent. &quot;I always wanted to play in Canada, and I wanted to go to Montreal if I had a chance, but Montreal wasn&#x27;t interested,&quot; Jágr said. &quot;All of a sudden, I got a phone call from Stars&#x27; general manager Joe Nieuwendyk that Dallas was interested.&quot;

During the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Jágr played for his team, Rytíři Kladno, in the Czech Extraliga. During the lockout, he scored 24 goals and 33 assists in 34 games and, before leaving Kladno for the Stars, was in second place on Czech Extraliga&#x27;s scoring list. After the NHL lockout ended, he made his debut as a Star on 19 January 2013, when he tallied two goals and two assists in a 4–3 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes.

Jágr reached the 1,000-assist mark on 29 March 2013 in a game against the Minnesota Wild, becoming just the 12th player to do so and the first non-Canadian NHLer to reach the milestone.

===Boston Bruins (2013)===

On 2 April 2013, Jágr was traded to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Lane MacDermid, Cody Payne and a conditional third-round pick in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. He made his Bruins debut on 4 April, scoring the lone goal in Boston&#x27;s 1–0 win over the New Jersey Devils, and with his second Bruins goal, the first scored in a 3–0 shutout over the Florida Panthers on 21 April, Jágr tied the record for the most game-winning goals in an NHL career (118), previously set by Phil Esposito.

When Jágr played in the first game of the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals on 12 June, he set a new record for the longest gap between Finals appearances at 21 years, surpassing the previous record of 19 years, which was established by Gary Roberts in 2008; coincidentally, both instances involved someone with the Penguins at one end of those streaks. Also coincidental was that, as in his previous Stanley Cup appearance, Jágr&#x27;s opponents were the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Chicago Blackhawks. He spent the bulk of the Bruins&#x27; lengthy playoff run on the top line with Brad Marchand and Patrice Bergeron. After the Bruins lost the Finals to Chicago in six games, the team announced on 26 June that they did not intend to offer Jágr a new contract.

===New Jersey Devils (2013–2015)===
On 22 July 2013, Jágr signed a one-year contract with the New Jersey Devils; the contract included $2 million guaranteed and another $2 million as an incentive bonus if Jágr was to play in at least 40 games. Jágr, at age 41, hoped to help the Devils overcome the loss of Ilya Kovalchuk, who had previously departed for the KHL. Jágr scored his first goal as a Devil on 7 October, in a 5–4 shootout loss to the Edmonton Oilers. The goal came on the 23rd anniversary of his first NHL goal which, coincidentally, was against the Devils.
On 21 November, Jágr tied Gordie Howe&#x27;s record of game-winning goals with 121, with his 690th goal, which tied him in ninth place (with former teammate Mario Lemieux) for all-time goal-scoring leaders. On 20 December, he scored his 693rd goal, putting him in eighth place over Steve Yzerman. A day later, Jágr tied Mark Messier for seventh place in NHL history for goals scored with 694. Later in the season, on 14 January 2014, he scored his 695th goal, passing Messier, putting him 14 goals away from passing Mike Gartner. On 1 March, Jágr scored his 700th career NHL goal as the Devils won 6–1 against the New York Islanders at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. On 8 April, near the conclusion of the Devils&#x27; season, he was awarded the New Jersey Devils MVP Award at their annual team awards ceremony. He scored two points in his final game of the season (two assists in the third period), surpassing Gordie Howe for eighth place on the NHL&#x27;s all-time list for career assists and tying Steve Yzerman for sixth on the all-time points list at 1,755. Jágr finished the season as the team&#x27;s leading scorer, with his highest points total in a season since 2007–08. Jágr&#x27;s play led the Devils to re-sign him to another one-year contract on 30 April. He became the joint sixth-highest scorer in NHL history in November 2014 after scoring his 708th NHL goal for the Devils against Boston. On 8 December, in his 1,500th NHL game, he moved ahead of Marcel Dionne for fifth place on the NHL&#x27;s all-time points list with 1,772. On 3 January 2015, in a game against the Philadelphia Flyers, Jágr became the oldest player in NHL history to score a hat-trick at 42 years and 322 days. The record was previously held by Detroit Red Wings defenceman Nicklas Lidström.

===Florida Panthers (2015–2017)===
On 26 February 2015, Jágr was traded to the Florida Panthers in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft and a third-round pick in 2016. He made his team debut on 28 February in a 5–3 Panthers win over the Buffalo Sabres and registered his first points with the team in the following game on 1 March, posting a goal and an assist in a 4–3 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning. On 19 March, Jágr scored his 718th career goal against Detroit to move him past Phil Esposito and fifth on the all-time goal-scoring list. In a 9 April, 4–2 Panthers victory over the Bruins, Jágr registered two assists to give him 1,800 career points in the NHL and sole possession of fourth place on the all-time points list, surpassing former Penguins teammate Ron Francis. On 11 April, in the Panthers&#x27; season finale, Jágr reached 2,000 NHL points (including playoff games) when he assisted on a Jonathan Huberdeau goal. He scored his 800th NHL goal (including playoffs) later in the third period. On 12 April, one day after the end of the 2014–15 regular season, Jágr signed a new one-year, $3.5 million contract with Florida for the 2015–16 season.
Jágr reached multiple milestones as a Panther. On 20 December 2015, he scored his 732nd goal, passing Marcel Dionne for fourth place in NHL history. On 4 February 2016, Jágr became the sixth player in NHL history to record 1,100 career assists. On 20 February, he scored his 742nd goal, surpassing Brett Hull for third place in NHL history. In a 7 March, 5–4 overtime loss to the Bruins, an assist on Aleksander Barkov&#x27;s goal put Jágr at 1,851 career points, passing Gordie Howe on the all-time points list and putting him in sole possession of third place overall. With the Panthers qualifying for the 2016 playoffs, Jágr played in his first playoff series since the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals. Though he only registered two assists in the Panthers&#x27; six-game first-round exit to the Islanders (who would win their first playoff series since 1993), he became the fifth NHL player all-time to record 200 career playoff points.

At age 44, Jágr led the Panthers in scoring with 66 points. In reward for his strong play and leadership abilities, the team announced on 5 May 2016 that they had signed Jágr to a new one-year, $4 million contract.

On 20 October 2016, Jágr became the third player in NHL history to score 750 goals. On 22 December 2016, he scored his 1,888th career point, surpassing Mark Messier to become second in career points, and on 15 February 2017, his 45th birthday, he became the second player to register his 1,900th NHL point.

In 2017 on Twitter, as a free agent, Jágr tweeted: &quot;FA 1994 - all GMs called, FA 2017- 0 calls&quot; accompanied by a trophy emoji and a smiley emoji and pictures taken in 1994 and 2017. In the 1994 picture, a smiling Jágr is on the phone with an unspecified general manager. In the 2017 picture, he looks at his mobile phone with a puzzled expression. The Panthers organization announced shortly after that they would not offer Jágr a new contract.

===Calgary Flames (2017–2018)===
On 4 October 2017, Jágr signed a one-year contract with the Calgary Flames. Jágr had indicated before that he would like to play professionally until age 50, but later said that it would be very likely that he would stop playing after the 2017–18 season, at which point he would be 46. He noted the tendency of teams to focus on younger players to the exclusion of older ones like himself, which he considers understandable and in light of which he remarked, &quot;I was pretty lucky.&quot; The Flames were Jágr&#x27;s ninth NHL team, but his first Canadian team, which prompted him to say, &quot;I want to get the experience so I can one day say I played for a Canadian team. So I&#x27;m here.&quot;

On 9 November 2017 against the Detroit Red Wings, Jágr scored his first goal as a Flame, earning two points in a 6–3 win. However, on 6 January 2018, it was reported that Jágr and the Flames were negotiating the termination of his contract, as injuries had limited Jágr to a career-low seven points (including the one goal above) in 22 games. On 14 January 2018, Jágr was placed on the injured reserve, retroactive to 31 December 2017, while the Flames called up Ryan Lomberg from their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Stockton Heat, in his place. On 28 January, it was reported that Jágr was placed on waivers, signalling the end of his brief tenure with the Flames; he cleared waivers the following day and was assigned to Rytíři Kladno in the WSM Liga.

===Return to Kladno (2018–present)===
On 3 February 2018, Jágr played his first game for his hometown team, and his first game since 31 December 2017, playing nearly 20 minutes and recording three assists. In his fifth game for Kladno, he was injured and remained sidelined for the rest of the season with a knee injury. He played a few seconds in ten playoff games to be eligible for participation in the playoff finals. On 14 May, Jágr announced his plans to remain with Kladno for his 30th professional season. On 19 April, Jágr scored four goals in one game as Kladno was promoted to the top-flight Czech Extraliga.

In 2022, at the age of 50 and spending most of his games in the dressing room, Jágr admitted he was considering retirement, being too busy with the team administration and lacking the motivation for the physically demanding game, saying that at most he will &quot;have to force myself to go play&quot; in the alumni game of the 2023 NHL Winter Classic featuring the Penguins. The 2023–24 season marked Jágr&#x27;s 36th consecutive season of professional ice hockey, and in February 2023 he scored his 1,100th professional goal. Jágr has said that the biggest fear regarding retirement is the potential loss of sponsors for Kladno, thereby jeopardizing Kladno&#x27;s viability as a team.

On 20 December 2023, at 51, Jágr played his first game of his 36th professional season, recording an assist in a 4–3 loss.

On 18 April 2024, at 52 years and 63 days, Jágr scored against VHK Vsetín to become the oldest player ever to score a goal in a professional competition. He thus broke the record of Gordie Howe, who scored the last goal at 52 years and six days.

On 19 September 2024, Jágr announced he would retire from professional hockey at the conclusion of the 2024–25 season.

==International play==
Jágr has represented his country many times. In 1994, he and Pittsburgh Penguins teammate Martin Straka arrived in the middle of the 1994 World Championships after Pittsburgh&#x27;s elimination from the Stanley Cup playoffs. Czech fans&#x27; expectations were high as Jágr was an NHL star, but before the team could integrate him, the Czechs lost their quarterfinal game and were eliminated. Jágr was also hurt in numerous other games.

The 1996 World Cup of Hockey also did not see Jágr at his best. The flu hampered his performance and it only underscored the poor play of the whole team — after losing 7–3 to Finland, 3–0 to Sweden and even 7–1 to a relatively weak Germany, the team did not qualify for the tournament&#x27;s playoffs.

The team&#x27;s recent failures, however, were mitigated in 1998 when the Czech Republic won the men&#x27;s gold medal in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. It was only the third gold medal for Czech or Czechoslovak athletes from the Winter Olympics and is still fondly remembered.

Jágr did not play in the 1996, 1999, 2000 nor 2001 World Championships in which the Czech Republic won the gold medals. He was, however, a team member at the 2004 World Championship in Prague, where the expectations were high. However, after the team won all the games in the group, they lost in the quarterfinal game, stumbling out of the tournament.

The 2005 edition of the tournament finally brought a gold medal to Jágr. Although he broke his finger in an early game against Germany, he played with it bandaged during the tournament, leading his team to victory.

More injuries struck Jágr in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. He was injured after a hit from Finland&#x27;s Jarkko Ruutu, requiring stitches to his eyebrow. However, the injury was not as severe as first anticipated, and Jágr could play in the following games, though he could not finish the bronze medal game due to muscle injury. Despite the trouble, Jágr won his second career Olympic medal. In 2010, Jágr was his nation&#x27;s flag bearer at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Still, in the men&#x27;s ice hockey tournament, the Czechs finished a disappointing seventh after defeating Finland in the quarterfinals. Jágr again represented his country at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, scoring two goals and one assist in five games as the Czech Republic again lost in the quarterfinals.

After losing to Sweden in a battle for a bronze medal on 2014 IIHF World Championship in Minsk, Jágr announced the end of his career in international play with the Czech national team, focusing his efforts on returning to the NHL playoffs after New Jersey failed to qualify in 2014. However, Jágr stepped back from his decision after being called up to the Czech team for the 2015 IIHF World Championship in Prague and Ostrava, making the team&#x27;s roster. On 1 May, he scored a goal in the Czechs&#x27; 6–5 loss to Sweden, his 50th for the national team, to become the oldest player to score at the World Championship.
In the Czech Republic&#x27;s quarterfinal game against Finland, Jágr scored one assist and two goals, including the game-winning goal. At the end of the tournament, despite the Czechs&#x27; loss in the bronze medal game, Jágr was named the tournament&#x27;s most valuable player.

==Personal life==
Jágr resides in the Czech Republic during the off-season. His father, also named (1940–2022), owned a chain of hotels and served as president of HC Kladno. Jágr credited his physical strength and penchant for exercise to growing up on a farm and working all year long.

Jágr wears the number 68, which he has worn through his entire career, in honour of the Prague Spring that occurred in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and his grandfather, who died while in prison that same year and had earlier been imprisoned for opposing the collectivization of his farm in the post-war Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia. In any interviews when asked about his number, Jágr explains that he wears it not due to bad relations with Russian people, but rather due to disaffection with Communism. During his time with the New Jersey Devils, Jágr was granted special exception to keep wearing number 68, as then-general manager Lou Lamoriello had a policy in place which generally forbade players from wearing any number higher than 35. Jágr names former United States President Ronald Reagan as his hero for his work towards ending communism in Europe.

Jágr has been a long-time supporter of the liberal conservative Civic Democratic Party (ODS), stating in 2004 that he &quot;had always&quot; voted for the party. In the previous election, he appeared on the party&#x27;s billboards and was among its sponsors. On 26 May 2010, Jágr announced that he was backing the Civic Democrats and its leader Petr Nečas. At the press conference, he said, &quot;I realize that there will be elections in two to three days. I would like their outcome to be good.&quot; He also urged the party not to forget about sports when distributing money. &quot;We all know what would happen if the young did not practice any sport. If children practice some sport, they do not have time for other things such as alcohol.&quot;

Jágr is an Orthodox Christian; he was baptized in 2001 by Prague&#x27;s metropolitan. He began to speak more publicly about his faith during his three-year stint in Russia, a historically Orthodox nation.

Although he has repeatedly denied that he has a gambling problem, Jágr admitted in 2003 that he settled debts totaling $950,000 with two internet gambling sites between 1998 and 2002. The first of these incidents centered on Belize-based website CaribSports and its owner, William Caesar, to which Jágr owed $500,000. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reported that Jágr agreed to make monthly payments to Caesar to settle the debt, and Caesar leaked the story to the press when Jágr stopped making payments. In 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a $3.27 million lien against him for unpaid taxes for the 2001 tax year. Only a few months before, Jágr had settled a $350,000 claim for taxes dating to 1999. In the summer of 2006, Jágr sued his former accountant over a tax form that was supposed to have been filed in 2003, claiming that the form would have saved him $6 million had it been timely filed.

In 2015, an 18-year-old model attempted to extort $2,000 from Jágr, threatening to post a photo of them in bed; Jágr responded, &quot;I don’t care,&quot; leading to the picture being published online.

Jágr&#x27;s longevity in the NHL has spawned a fan club known as &quot;The Traveling Jagrs&quot;, a group of hockey fans from the Alberta cities of Calgary and Camrose who share interest in the player. The group dresses in the sweater, hockey socks and pant shells of 11 of Jágr&#x27;s teams (his nine NHL teams, the NHL All-Star team and the Czech national team) plus long black wigs in reference to Jágr&#x27;s traditional hair-style. Usually, the club would travel once or twice a year to see him play in person, but after Jágr signed with the Flames, they announced that they would be a more regular fixture at games.

Founded as the Indiana Collegiate Athletic Conference (ICAC) in 1987, it reincorporated under its current name in 1998 with the addition of several schools from Ohio.

Original members of the HCAC included Anderson, Bluffton, Franklin, Hanover, Manchester, Mount St. Joseph, Wabash, and Wilmington. Of the ten current members, six were founding members of the former ICAC.

Former members include DePauw (1987–1998), Taylor (1988–1991), Wabash (1987–1999), Wilmington (1998–2000), and Defiance (2000–2024). Rose–Hulman Institute of Technology (1988–1998) re-joined as of July 1, 2006.

==History==
The Indiana Collegiate Athletic Conference (ICAC) was formed in June 1987, with 1990–91 being the first full season of competition (all eight teams competing in eight varsity sports).

Charter members in 1987 included Anderson University, DePauw University, Franklin College, Hanover College, Manchester College, and Wabash College. Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and Taylor University later joined in 1988. Taylor left the conference after the 1990–91 season.

The addition of three Ohio schools (Bluffton College, the College of Mount St. Joseph, and Wilmington College) and the departure of two Indiana schools (DePauw and Rose-Hulman) during the 1998–99 season prompted a change in name to Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference. Wabash and Wilmington later departed in the 1998–99 and 1999–2000 seasons respectively. Defiance College and Transylvania University joined in 2000 and 2001 respectively. Rose-Hulman re-joined the HCAC, effective for the 2006–07 season.

In October 2009, Earlham College of Richmond, Indiana was accepted as the 10th member of the conference and began competition in the fall of 2010.

In the summer of 2024, Defiance College departed the HCAC to join the NAIA and the Wolverine–Hoosier Athletic Conference. Berea College joined the HCAC at the start of the 2024–25 academic year.

<doc id="255206" wikidata="Q919192" url="?curid=255206" title="Leo G. Carroll">
<text>Leo Grattan Carroll (25 October 1886 – 16 October 1972) was an English actor. In a career of more than 40 years, he appeared in six Hitchcock films including &quot;Spellbound&quot;, &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; and &quot;North by Northwest&quot; and in three television series, &quot;Topper&quot;, &quot;Going My Way&quot;, and &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;

==Early life==
Carroll was born in Weedon Bec, Northamptonshire, to William and Catherine Carroll. His Roman Catholic parents named him after then-Pope Leo XIII. In 1897, his family lived in York, where his Irish-born father was a foreman in an ordnance store. In the 1901 census for West Ham, Essex, his occupation is listed as &quot;wine trade clerk&quot;. In the 1911 census, he is living at the same address and described as a &quot;dramatic agent&quot;.

==Stage career==
Carroll made his stage debut in 1912. His acting career was on hold during the First World War, when he served in the British Army. Carroll saw action in France, Salonika and Palestine during the war; he was badly wounded while serving in the last. After his recovery and discharge, he again took up acting in December 1919.

He then performed in London and on Broadway. His American stage debut came in &quot;The Vortex&quot;. In 1933, he was a member of the Manhattan Theatre Repertory Company in the inaugural season of the Ogunquit Playhouse in Ogunquit, Maine.

During 1933–34, Carroll had the role of &quot;impeccable valet&quot; Trump in the Broadway play &quot;The Green Bay Tree&quot; (which has no relation to the novel by Louis Bromfield apart from the shared title), and in 1941 starred with Vincent Price and Judith Evelyn in Patrick Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Angel Street&quot; (better known as &quot;Gaslight&quot;), which ran for three years at the Golden Theatre on West 45th Street in New York City.

After the production closed, he starred in the title role in John P. Marquand&#x27;s &quot;The Late George Apley&quot;. In 1947 he starred in John Van Druten&#x27;s &quot;The Druid Circle&quot; at the Morosco Theatre.

==Films and television==

Carroll, who had moved to Hollywood, made his film debut in &quot;Sadie McKee&quot; (1934). He often played doctors or butlers, but he made appearances as Marley&#x27;s ghost in and as Joseph in . He appeared in two Charlie Chan films, &quot;City in Darkness&quot; (1939) as a shady French locksmith, followed by a role in &quot;Charlie Chan&#x27;s Murder Cruise&quot; (1940) as a passenger on a ship. In the original version of , he played an unctuous wedding caterer. In the 1951 film &quot;The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel&quot; he played a sympathetic German field marshal, Gerd von Rundstedt, presenting him as a tragic, resigned figure completely disillusioned with Hitler.

Carroll is perhaps best known for his roles in six Alfred Hitchcock films: , , , &quot;The Paradine Case&quot; (1947), and &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959). He appeared in more Hitchcock films than anyone other than Clare Greet (1871–1939) (who appeared in seven) and Hitchcock himself, whose cameos were a trademark. As with earlier roles, he was often cast as doctors or other authority figures (such as the spymaster &quot;Professor&quot; in &quot;North by Northwest&quot;). Carroll eventually played a character based on Hitchcock himself in &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952).

Carroll had a central role in the highly rated movie &quot;&quot; (1955) with Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov and Basil Rathbone, among others.

In addition to appearing as Rev. Mosby with actress Hayley Mills in , Carroll is remembered for his role as the frustrated banker haunted by the ghosts of George and Marion Kerby in the television series &quot;Topper&quot; (1953–1956), with co-stars Anne Jeffreys, Robert Sterling and Lee Patrick. He appeared as the older Father Fitzgibbon from 1962 to 1963 in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Going My Way&quot;, a series about two Roman Catholic priests at St. Dominic&#x27;s parish in New York City. In 1963–1964, he portrayed John Miller in &quot;Channing&quot; on ABC. Carroll subsequently starred as spymaster Alexander Waverly on &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (1964–1968). Several &quot;U.N.C.L.E.&quot; films were derived from the series, and a spin-off television series, &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; in 1966. He was one of the first actors to appear in two different television series as the same character.

Carroll appeared in spots on the first two regular episodes of &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, the series that replaced &quot;U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, and in fact appears as Mr. Waverly in the very first episode party scene where he is seen using a pen communicator to call Kuryakin to report that he believes he has found THRUSH headquarters.

==Death==
In 1972, Carroll died in Hollywood of cancer-induced pneumonia nine days before his 86th birthday. He is interred at the Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==In popular culture==
Carroll was posthumously referenced in the lyrics of &quot;Science Fiction/Double Feature&quot;, the opening song of the musical stage production &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; and its 1975 film adaptation. The song refers to Carroll in connection with his role in the film &quot;Tarantula&quot;.

<text>Emil Wallber (April 1, 1841June 2, 1923) was a German American lawyer and judge. He was the Mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the time of the Bay View massacre and labor strike, and adopted the city&#x27;s first ordinance on an eight-hour work day.

==Early life and career==

Born in Berlin, Prussia, Wallber immigrated to the United States with his family in 1850. He is the son of Julius and Henrietta Krohn Wallber, both of whom had also been born in Berlin. They settled in New York City, where he was educated in the public schools and the New York free academy.

At age 14, Wallber moved to Milwaukee, intent on studying law. He first took a position as a clerk for Charles F. Bode, who was then justice of the peace. He then went to study in the law offices of Edward Salomon and Winfield Smith, who would later become the governor and Attorney General of Wisconsin, respectively. Salomon was elected lieutenant governor in 1861, and became governor on the death of Governor Harvey in April 1862. On ascending to the governorship, Salomon hired Wallber as his chief clerk. Wallber served with Governor Salomon until the end of his term in January 1864. Wallber meanwhile continued his study of the law and was admitted to the State Bar of Wisconsin later that year. He then returned to the service of Winfield Smith as an assistant attorney general and remained in that role until the end of Smith&#x27;s term in 1866.

==Elected office==
Wallber then returned to Milwaukee and practiced law. He was elected as a school commissioner, and served as president of the school board from 1871 to 1873. He was elected to serve in the Wisconsin State Assembly for the 1872 session, and served as Milwaukee City Attorney from 1873 to 1878. He was County court commissioner for ten years, and from 1883 to 1890 was a regent of the state normal schools.

He was elected Mayor of Milwaukee in 1884 and was re-elected in 1886. During his second term as mayor, there was a major labor walkout during agitation for the eight-hour workday. The strikes closed virtually every business in Milwaukee, starting on May Day, May 1, 1886. At Wallber&#x27;s request, the Governor, Jeremiah McLain Rusk, called up the Wisconsin National Guard. In what&#x27;s now known as the Bay View massacre, on May 5, the national guard fired into the protesters as they marched on the North Chicago Rolling Mills in Bay View. Seven people died as a result, including a thirteen year old boy.

In April 1889, the year after he left the Mayors office, Wallber was elected judge of the municipal court. He was re-elected in 1895 and left office in 1902. In his later life, he served as a German consular agent in Milwaukee from 1906 to his retirement in 1917.

Wallber is buried at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee.

<text>David Stuart Rose (June 30, 1856 – August 8, 1932) was an American lawyer and Democratic politician.

== Background ==
Born in Darlington, Wisconsin, Rose joined his father&#x27;s law firm in Darlington. He served as mayor of Darlington in 1883 and 1884 and was county judge of Lafayette County, Wisconsin.

== Move to Milwaukee ==
In 1886, he moved to Milwaukee where he practiced law and was twice elected mayor of the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin serving from 1898 to 1906 and from 1908 to 1910. His successor as the Democratic candidate, V. J. Schoenecker, was defeated by Socialist Emil Seidel. Rose was the 1902 Democratic nominee for Governor of Wisconsin, running a conservative campaign losing to incumbent Robert M. La Follette by a wide margin.

His administration was known for widespread corruption. Under &quot;All the Time Rosy&quot;, Milwaukee had a reputation as a &quot;wide-open&quot; town that tolerated prostitution, gambling and late-night saloons. As historian John Gurda put it, &quot;Virtually everything that was not nailed down - from public hay supplies to aldermanic votes - was for sale to the highest bidder.&quot; After spending some time in California trying to promote trade with China, Rose returned to Milwaukee and ran once again for mayor in 1924 but lost the election to Socialist Daniel Hoan.

== Back to Lafayette County ==
Rose later returned to Darlington and in 1931 ran once more (unsuccessfully) for county judge of Lafayette County. He died in Milwaukee on August 8, 1932, and is buried in Darlington.

<text>Emil Seidel (December 13, 1864 – June 24, 1947) was an American politician. Seidel was the mayor of Milwaukee from 1910 to 1912. The first Socialist mayor of a major city in the United States, Seidel became the vice presidential candidate for the Socialist Party of America in the 1912 presidential election.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Seidel was born December 13, 1864, in the town of Ashland in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, the son of ethnic German emigrants from Pomerania. His family moved to Wisconsin in 1867, living first in Prairie du Chien before moving to the state capital of Madison. Seidel&#x27;s father, Otto Seidel, was a carpenter, and his mother, Henrietta Knoll Seidel, was a homemaker.

Seidel attended public school up to the age of 13, when he dropped out to become a woodcarver. He continued to study after leaving school, reading extensively. At the age of 19 he started a trade union of local woodworkers, becoming the organization&#x27;s first secretary.

At the age of 22, Seidel went abroad to refine his skills as a woodcarver. He lived for six years in Berlin, working at his trade during the day and attending school at night. It was in this period that Seidel first became an active socialist.

In 1895, Seidel married Lucy Geissel. They had one son, Lucius, who died in infancy, and one daughter, Viola. The pair would ultimately divorce in 1924.

===Political career===
When Seidel returned to the United States in 1892 he joined the Socialist Labor Party of America. Seidel was a charter member of the first SLP branch in Milwaukee. He also became an active member of the Pattern Makers Union.

Seidel later joined the Social Democracy of America (established 1897), the Social Democratic Party of America (established 1898), and the Socialist Party of America (established 1901) in turn. He resided briefly in Washington state, serving as the first secretary of Local Redmond SPA in the fall of 1901.

In 1904 Seidel was one of nine Socialists to win electoral victory as Milwaukee city aldermen, elected in the city&#x27;s 20th ward. He served two terms in that position before making his first mayoral run in 1908. He was returned as a city alderman at large in the election of 1909.

In 1910, Seidel was elected mayor of Milwaukee, becoming the first Socialist mayor of a major city in the United States. During his administration the first public works department was established, the first fire and police commission was organized, and a city park system came into being. Seidel cleaned up the town with strict regulation of bars and the closing of brothels and sporting parlors (modern-day casinos). During his administration Seidel employed the noted American poet and author Carl Sandburg as his personal secretary. Seidel&#x27;s socialist inclinations had attracted Sandburg to Milwaukee.

In his Spring 1912 bid for re-election, Seidel faced the combined forces of the Democratic and Republican parties, who ran a single candidate in order to defeat Seidel and the Socialists. Despite winning more votes in 1912 than in 1910, Seidel was defeated by Gerhard Bading, local doctor, professor of surgery, and commissioner of health, on a fusion Democratic-Republican ticket.

Freed of his mayoral duties by electoral defeat, Seidel became a logical choice as the Socialist Party&#x27;s nominee for Vice President of the United States on the ticket with Eugene V. Debs. The pair won 901,551 votes in the 1912 presidential election, 6% of the total vote.

Seidel tried to win re-election as mayor of Milwaukee in 1914, but was soundly defeated. He was returned to the city council as an alderman at large in the city election of 1916. He won re-election in 1918, remaining at the post until 1920.

Seidel, an opponent of World War I, voted against Milwaukee&#x27;s purchase of Liberty bonds to help finance the war effort. He also was an outspoken opponent of a proposed Milwaukee &quot;loyalty ordinance&quot;. In the superheated wartime political climate, marked by political repression of the anti-war movement, Seidel ran afoul of the law when he was arrested on November 12, 1917, in Horicon, Wisconsin following a speech he made there. Charged with &quot;tending to provoke an assault or breach of peace during an address&quot;, he was fined $50.

In 1932, Seidel ran for a seat in the United States Senate from Wisconsin, winning 6% of the vote. He served a final four-year stint as a Milwaukee city alderman from 1932 until 1936.

===Later years===

Seidel retired from political life in the mid-1930s. He remained a resident of Milwaukee, living on the northwest side of the city, passing his time painting, composing music, creating poetry, and writing his autobiography.

===Death and legacy===

Seidel died in Milwaukee on June 24, 1947, following an illness of several months&#x27; duration related to complications from a heart condition. He was 82 years old.

Seidel&#x27;s unpublished memoirs reside in Madison at the Wisconsin Historical Society, where they are available to scholars on microfilm.

<text>In physics, the dynamo theory proposes a mechanism by which a celestial body such as Earth or a star generates a magnetic field. The dynamo theory describes the process through which a rotating, convecting, and electrically conducting fluid can maintain a magnetic field over astronomical time scales. A dynamo is thought to be the source of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and the magnetic fields of Mercury and the Jovian planets.

== History of theory ==

When William Gilbert published &quot;de Magnete&quot; in 1600, he concluded that the Earth is magnetic and proposed the first hypothesis for the origin of this magnetism: permanent magnetism such as that found in lodestone. In 1822, André-Marie Ampère proposed that internal currents are responsible for Earth&#x27;s magnetism. In 1919, Joseph Larmor proposed that a dynamo might be generating the field. However, even after he advanced his hypothesis, some prominent scientists advanced alternative explanations. The Nobel Prize winner Patrick Blackett did a series of experiments looking for a fundamental relation between angular momentum and magnetic moment, but found none.

Walter M. Elsasser, considered a &quot;father&quot; of the presently accepted dynamo theory as an explanation of the Earth&#x27;s magnetism, proposed that this magnetic field resulted from electric currents induced in the fluid outer core of the Earth. He revealed the history of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field through pioneering the study of the magnetic orientation of minerals in rocks.

In order to maintain the magnetic field against ohmic decay (which would occur for the dipole field in 20,000 years), the outer core must be convecting. The convection is likely some combination of thermal and compositional convection. The mantle controls the rate at which heat is extracted from the core. Heat sources include gravitational energy released by the compression of the core, gravitational energy released by the rejection of light elements (probably sulfur, oxygen, or silicon) at the inner core boundary as it grows, latent heat of crystallization at the inner core boundary, and radioactivity of potassium, uranium and thorium.

At the dawn of the 21st century, numerical modeling of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field has not been successfully demonstrated. Initial models are focused on field generation by convection in the planet&#x27;s fluid outer core. It was possible to show the generation of a strong, Earth-like field when the model assumed a uniform core-surface temperature and exceptionally high viscosities for the core fluid. Computations which incorporated more realistic parameter values yielded magnetic fields that were less Earth-like, but indicated that model refinements may ultimately lead to an accurate analytic model. Slight variations in the core-surface temperature, in the range of a few millikelvins, result in significant increases in convective flow and produce more realistic magnetic fields.

==Formal definition==
Dynamo theory describes the process through which a rotating, convecting, and electrically conducting fluid acts to maintain a magnetic field. This theory is used to explain the presence of anomalously long-lived magnetic fields in astrophysical bodies. The conductive fluid in the geodynamo is liquid iron in the outer core, and in the solar dynamo is ionized gas at the tachocline. Dynamo theory of astrophysical bodies uses magnetohydrodynamic equations to investigate how the fluid can continuously regenerate the magnetic field.

It was once believed that the dipole, which comprises much of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and is misaligned along the rotation axis by 11.3 degrees, was caused by permanent magnetization of the materials in the earth. This means that dynamo theory was originally used to explain the Sun&#x27;s magnetic field in its relationship with that of the Earth. However, this hypothesis, which was initially proposed by Joseph Larmor in 1919, has been modified due to extensive studies of magnetic secular variation, paleomagnetism (including polarity reversals), seismology, and the solar system&#x27;s abundance of elements. Also, the application of the theories of Carl Friedrich Gauss to magnetic observations showed that Earth&#x27;s magnetic field had an internal, rather than external, origin.

There are three requisites for a dynamo to operate:

*An electrically conductive fluid medium
*Kinetic energy provided by planetary rotation
*An internal energy source to drive convective motions within the fluid.

In the case of the Earth, the magnetic field is induced and constantly maintained by the convection of liquid iron in the outer core. A requirement for the induction of field is a rotating fluid. Rotation in the outer core is supplied by the Coriolis effect caused by the rotation of the Earth. The Coriolis force tends to organize fluid motions and electric currents into columns (also see Taylor columns) aligned with the rotation axis. Induction or generation of magnetic field is described by the induction equation:
formula_1
where is velocity, is magnetic field, is time, and formula_2 is the magnetic diffusivity with formula_3 electrical conductivity and formula_4 permeability. The ratio of the second term on the right hand side to the first term gives the magnetic Reynolds number, a dimensionless ratio of advection of magnetic field to diffusion.

===Tidal heating supporting a dynamo===
Tidal forces between celestial orbiting bodies cause friction that heats up their interiors. This is known as tidal heating, and it helps keep the interior in a liquid state. A liquid interior that can conduct electricity is required to produce a dynamo. Saturn&#x27;s Enceladus and Jupiter&#x27;s Io have enough tidal heating to liquify their inner cores, but they may not create a dynamo because they cannot conduct electricity. Mercury, despite its small size, has a magnetic field, because it has a conductive liquid core created by its iron composition and friction resulting from its highly elliptical orbit. It is theorized that the Moon once had a magnetic field, based on evidence from magnetized lunar rocks, due to its short-lived closer distance to Earth creating tidal heating. An orbit and rotation of a planet helps provide a liquid core, and supplements kinetic energy that supports a dynamo action.

==Kinematic dynamo theory==
In kinematic dynamo theory the velocity field is &quot;prescribed&quot;, instead of being a dynamic variable: The model makes no provision for the flow distorting in response to the magnetic field. This method cannot provide the time variable behaviour of a fully nonlinear chaotic dynamo, but can be used to study how magnetic field strength varies with the flow structure and speed.

Using Maxwell&#x27;s equations simultaneously with the curl of Ohm&#x27;s law, one can derive what is basically a linear eigenvalue equation for magnetic fields (), which can be done when assuming that the magnetic field is independent from the velocity field. One arrives at a critical &quot;magnetic Reynolds number&quot;, above which the flow strength is sufficient to amplify the imposed magnetic field, and below which the magnetic field dissipates.

=== Practical measure of possible dynamos ===
The most functional feature of kinematic dynamo theory is that it can be used to test whether a velocity field is or is not capable of dynamo action. By experimentally applying a certain velocity field to a small magnetic field, one can observe whether the magnetic field tends to grow (or not) in response to the applied flow. If the magnetic field does grow, then the system is either capable of dynamo action or is a dynamo, but if the magnetic field does not grow, then it is simply referred to as “not a dynamo”.

An analogous method called the &quot;membrane paradigm&quot; is a way of looking at black holes that allows for the material near their surfaces to be expressed in the language of dynamo theory.

=== Spontaneous breakdown of a topological supersymmetry ===
Kinematic dynamo can be also viewed as the phenomenon of the spontaneous breakdown of the topological supersymmetry of the associated stochastic differential equation related to the flow of the background matter. Within stochastic supersymmetric theory, this supersymmetry is an intrinsic property of &quot;all&quot; stochastic differential equations, its interpretation is that the model&#x27;s phase space preserves continuity via continuous time flows. When the continuity of that flow spontaneously breaks down, the system is in the stochastic state of &quot;deterministic chaos&quot;. In other words, kinematic dynamo arises because of chaotic flow in the underlying background matter.

==Nonlinear dynamo theory==
The kinematic approximation becomes invalid when the magnetic field becomes strong enough to affect the fluid motions. In that case the velocity field becomes affected by the Lorentz force, and so the induction equation is no longer linear in the magnetic field. In most cases this leads to a quenching of the amplitude of the dynamo. Such dynamos are sometimes also referred to as &quot;hydromagnetic dynamos&quot;.
Virtually all dynamos in astrophysics and geophysics are hydromagnetic dynamos.

The main idea of the theory is that any small magnetic field existing in the outer core creates currents in the moving fluid there due to Lorentz force. These currents create further magnetic field due to Ampere&#x27;s law. With the fluid motion, the currents are carried in a way that the magnetic field gets stronger (as long as formula_5 is negative). Thus a &quot;seed&quot; magnetic field can get stronger and stronger until it reaches some value that is related to existing non-magnetic forces.

Numerical models are used to simulate fully nonlinear dynamos. The following equations are used:

*The induction equation, presented above.
*Maxwell&#x27;s equations for negligible electric field: formula_6
*The continuity equation for conservation of mass, for which the Boussinesq approximation is often used: formula_7
*The Navier-Stokes equation for conservation of momentum, again in the same approximation, with the magnetic force and gravitation force as the external forces: formula_8 where formula_9 is the kinematic viscosity, formula_10is the mean density and formula_11 is the relative density perturbation that provides buoyancy (for thermal convection formula_12 where formula_13 is coefficient of thermal expansion), formula_14 is the rotation rate of the Earth, and formula_15 is the electric current density.
*A transport equation, usually of heat (sometimes of light element concentration): formula_16 where is temperature, formula_17 is the thermal diffusivity with thermal conductivity, formula_18 heat capacity, and formula_19 density, and formula_20 is an optional heat source. Often the pressure is the dynamic pressure, with the hydrostatic pressure and centripetal potential removed.

These equations are then non-dimensionalized, introducing the non-dimensional parameters,
formula_21
where is the Rayleigh number, the Ekman number, and the Prandtl and magnetic Prandtl number. Magnetic field scaling is often in Elsasser number units formula_22

===Energy conversion between magnetic and kinematic energy===
The scalar product of the above form of Navier-Stokes equation with formula_23 gives the rate of increase of kinetic energy density, formula_24, on the left-hand side. The last term on the right-hand side is then formula_5, the local contribution to the kinetic energy due to Lorentz force.

The scalar product of the induction equation with formula_26 gives the rate of increase of the magnetic energy density, formula_27, on the left-hand side. The last term on the right-hand side is then formula_28 Since the equation is volume-integrated, this term is equivalent up to a boundary term (and with the double use of the scalar triple product identity) to formula_29 (where one of Maxwell&#x27;s equations was used). This is the local contribution to the magnetic energy due to fluid motion.

Thus the term formula_30 is the rate of transformation of kinetic energy to magnetic energy. This has to be non-negative at least in part of the volume, for the dynamo to produce magnetic field.

From the diagram above, it is not clear why this term should be positive. A simple argument can be based on consideration of net effects. To create the magnetic field, the net electric current must wrap around the axis of rotation of the planet. In that case, for the term to be positive, the net flow of conducting matter must be towards the axis of rotation. The diagram only shows a net flow from the poles to the equator. However mass conservation requires an additional flow from the equator toward the poles. If that flow was along the axis of rotation, that implies the circulation would be completed by a flow from the ones shown towards the axis of rotation, producing the desired effect.

===Order of magnitude of the magnetic field created by Earth&#x27;s dynamo===
The above formula for the rate of conversion of kinetic energy to magnetic energy, is equivalent to a rate of work done by a force of formula_31 on the outer core matter, whose velocity is formula_32. This work is the result of non-magnetic forces acting on the fluid.

Of those, the gravitational force and the centrifugal force are conservative and therefore have no overall contribution to fluid moving in closed loops. Ekman number (defined above), which is the ratio between the two remaining forces, namely the viscosity and Coriolis force, is very low inside Earth&#x27;s outer core, because its viscosity is low (1.2–1.5 ×10 pascal-second) due to its liquidity.

Thus the main time-averaged contribution to the work is from Coriolis force, whose size is formula_33 though this quantity and formula_34 are related only indirectly and are not in general equal locally (thus they affect each other but not in the same place and time).

The current density is itself the result of the magnetic field according to Ohm&#x27;s law. Again, due to matter motion and current flow, this is not necessarily the field at the same place and time. However these relations can still be used to deduce orders of magnitude of the quantities in question.

In terms of order of magnitude, formula_35 and formula_36, giving formula_37 or:
formula_38

The exact ratio between both sides is the square root of Elsasser number.

Note that the magnetic field direction cannot be inferred from this approximation (at least not its sign) as it appears squared, and is, indeed, sometimes reversed, though in general it lies on a similar axis to that of formula_39.

For earth outer core, is approximately 104 kg/m3,   = 2/day = 7.3×10−5/second   and     is approximately   107Ω−1m−1 .
This gives   2.7×10−4 Tesla.

The magnetic field of a magnetic dipole has an inverse cubic dependence in distance, so its order of magnitude at the earth surface can be approximated by multiplying the above result with giving   2.5×10−5 Tesla, not far from the measured value of 3×10−5 Tesla at the equator.

==Numerical models==

Broadly, models of the geodynamo attempt to produce magnetic fields consistent with observed data given certain conditions and equations as mentioned in the sections above. Implementing the magnetohydrodynamic equations successfully was of particular significance because they pushed dynamo models to self-consistency. Though geodynamo models are especially prevalent, dynamo models are not necessarily restricted to the geodynamo; solar and general dynamo models are also of interest. Studying dynamo models has utility in the field of geophysics as doing so can identify how various mechanisms form magnetic fields like those produced by astrophysical bodies like Earth and how they cause magnetic fields to exhibit certain features, such as pole reversals.

The equations used in numerical models of dynamo are highly complex. For decades, theorists were confined to two dimensional &quot;kinematic dynamo&quot; models described above, in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and the effect on the magnetic field calculated. The progression from linear to nonlinear, three dimensional models of dynamo was largely hindered by the search for solutions to magnetohydrodynamic equations, which eliminate the need for many of the assumptions made in kinematic models and allow self-consistency. 

The first &quot;self-consistent&quot; dynamo models, ones that determine both the fluid motions and the magnetic field, were developed by two groups in 1995, one in Japan and one in the United States. The latter was made as a model with regards to the geodynamo and received significant attention because it successfully reproduced some of the characteristics of the Earth&#x27;s field. Following this breakthrough, there was a large swell in development of reasonable, three dimensional dynamo models.

Though many self-consistent models now exist, there are significant differences among the models, both in the results they produce and the way they were developed. Given the complexity of developing a geodynamo model, there are many places where discrepancies can occur such as when making assumptions involving the mechanisms that provide energy for the dynamo, when choosing values for parameters used in equations, or when normalizing equations. In spite of the many differences that may occur, most models have shared features like clear axial dipoles. In many of these models, phenomena like secular variation and geomagnetic polarity reversals have also been successfully recreated.

=== Observations ===

Many observations can be made from dynamo models. Models can be used to estimate how magnetic fields vary with time and can be compared to observed paleomagnetic data to find similarities between the model and the Earth. Due to the uncertainty of paleomagnetic observations, however, comparisons may not be entirely valid or useful. Simplified geodynamo models have shown relationships between the dynamo number (determined by variance in rotational rates in the outer core and mirror-asymmetric convection (e.g. when convection favors one direction in the north and the other in the south)) and magnetic pole reversals as well as found similarities between the geodynamo and the Sun&#x27;s dynamo. In many models, it appears that magnetic fields have somewhat random magnitudes that follow a normal trend that average to zero. In addition to these observations, general observations about the mechanisms powering the geodynamo can be made based on how accurately the model reflects actual data collected from Earth.

=== Modern modelling ===
The complexity of dynamo modelling is so great that models of the geodynamo are limited by the current power of supercomputers, particularly because calculating the Ekman and Rayleigh number of the outer core is extremely difficult and requires a vast number of computations.

Many improvements have been proposed in dynamo modelling since the self-consistent breakthrough in 1995. One suggestion in studying the complex magnetic field changes is applying spectral methods to simplify computations. Ultimately, until considerable improvements in computer power are made, the methods for computing realistic dynamo models will have to be made more efficient, so making improvements in methods for computing the model is of high importance for the advancement of numerical dynamo modelling.

<text>Carl Frederick Zeidler (January 4, 1908 – December 11, 1942) was an American politician and the mayor of the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from 1940 to 1942, winning election by unseating six-term Socialist mayor Dan Hoan. After just two years in office Zeidler resigned his position as mayor to enlist in the United States Navy Reserve to fight in World War II. His merchant marine ship and all hands died the coast of South Africa in December 1942 after being hit by a German U-boat U-159 torpedo attack.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Zeidler was born January 4, 1908, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to parents of German ancestry. He graduated from Marquette University in 1929 and received a J.D. in 1931.

===Political career===

Serving as an assistant city attorney for Milwaukee (1936–1940), Zeidler stunned the city when he upset six-term Socialist mayor Daniel Hoan to become mayor of Milwaukee in 1940. Hoan had served as mayor for the past 24 years.

His rise to power was orchestrated by young writers Robert Bloch (later the author of &quot;Psycho&quot;) and Harold Gauer, who created elaborate campaign shows. In Bloch&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Once Around the Bloch&quot;, he gives an inside account of the campaign, and the innovations he and Gauer came up with, such as the original &quot;releasing-balloons-from-the-ceiling&quot; &quot;schtick&quot;. He comments bitterly on how, after Zeidler&#x27;s election, they were ignored and not even paid their promised salaries, while credit was taken by local establishment figures like Milton Rice Polland instead.

Bloch ends the account with a philosophical point:

===Death and legacy===
Zeidler&#x27;s election was attracting attention on the national political scene as World War II broke out. After a year in office, Zeidler came to believe he could best help the war effort by enlisting; he resigned his position as mayor and accepted a Naval Reserve commission on April 8, 1942. He asked for the most dangerous job on ship and became officer in charge of a gun battery on board the merchant ship SS La Salle.

The ship and all hands were reported missing off the coast of South Africa on November 7, 1942, sunk by a German U-boat U-159 torpedo attack. Zeidler was officially presumed dead December 11, 1944. A gravestone cenotaph marks his plot at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee.

Carl&#x27;s brother, socialist Frank P. Zeidler, later became mayor of Milwaukee and served in that position from 1948 to 1960. Carl&#x27;s mayoral papers are archived at Milwaukee Public Library.

<doc id="255226" wikidata="Q5490545" url="?curid=255226" title="Frank Zeidler">
<text>Frank Paul Zeidler (September 20, 1912 – July 7, 2006) was an American socialist politician and mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, serving three terms from April 20, 1948, to April 18, 1960. Zeidler, a member of the Socialist Party of America, is the most recent Socialist Party candidate to be elected mayor of a large American city.

== Early life and career ==
Zeidler was born in Milwaukee on September 20, 1912. He studied at both the University of Chicago and Marquette University, but was never able to graduate due to ill health. He became a socialist because of socialism&#x27;s emphasis on peace and improving the conditions for workers. 

In an interview, Zeidler said he chose the ideology of socialism in 1933 &quot;because of several things in its philosophy. One was the brotherhood of people all over the world. Another was its struggle for peace. Another was the equal distribution of economic goods. Another was the idea of cooperation. A fifth was the idea of democratic planning in order to achieve your goals. Those were pretty good ideas&quot;. He distanced himself from the beliefs of communism, especially communism linked in any way to the Soviet Union. Indeed, he was (and remained) an active Lutheran, a religious commitment which he saw as being fulfilled rather than contradicted by his Socialist activism.

Later, however, he credited his adoption of socialism to reading left-wing literature, with the majority being written by Eugene V. Debs and Norman Thomas during the Great Depression.

Zeidler became an active member of the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League (YPSL), the youth branch of the Socialist Party of America, he later became the leader of the Milwaukee branch of the Red Falcons during the 1930s.

== Elections ==

Zeidler was elected Milwaukee County Surveyor in 1938 on the Progressive Party ballot line (the Socialist Party and Progressives were in coalition in Milwaukee at that time).

He was elected to a six-year term on the Milwaukee Board of School Directors (a non-partisan office) in 1941, just after his brother Carl Zeidler was elected Mayor of Milwaukee in 1940. In 1942, Frank Zeidler was the Socialist nominee for Governor of Wisconsin, receiving 1.41% of the vote in a six-way race. He was re-elected to the Milwaukee School Board in 1947.

After two years in office, Carl Zeidler enlisted in the Navy at the height of World War II. Carl was killed at sea when his ship was lost and became a local hero, helping to pave the way for his younger brother to become mayor. In 1948 Frank Zeidler ran for mayor in a crowded field of fourteen candidates and won, undoubtedly aided by the familiarity of his surname. The large field of candidates was due to Mayor John Bohn declining to seek re-election in 1948. Among the candidates that year was attorney Henry S. Reuss, a Democrat who later went on to win election to Congress in 1954. Zeidler was re-elected in 1952 and 1956, but declined to seek another term in 1960, citing health reasons.

Zeidler was Milwaukee&#x27;s third Socialist mayor (after Emil Seidel [1910-12] and Daniel Hoan [1916-40]), making Milwaukee the largest American city to elect three Socialists to its highest office (a fact that singer Alice Cooper pointed out in the 1992 film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;).

== Mayoralty ==
During Frank Zeidler&#x27;s administration, Milwaukee grew industrially and never had to borrow money to repay loans. During this period, Milwaukee nearly doubled its size with an aggressive campaign of municipal annexations: large parts of the Town of Lake and most of the Town of Granville were annexed to the city. The park system was upgraded. Zeidler spearheaded planning and construction of the beginning of Milwaukee&#x27;s freeway system, and turned it over to Milwaukee County in 1954. A transportation advocate claims that Zeidler always maintained that the projected Milwaukee freeway system should have been built and that the city&#x27;s competitiveness had been compromised by the failure to complete the planned system.

Zeidler&#x27;s plans for the city were only a partial success. Milwaukee doubled in area through annexation and it experienced very little decline in population during a period of American urban decline starting in the 1960s and lasting until about 1990. Suburban residents and governments fiercely resisted annexation and the politics of regional Milwaukee became highly factional. An attorney who sued to block annexation claimed Zeidler planted listening devices in his office. Zeidler, angry about the resistance to his plans, said in 1958: &quot;The city consults with suburban governments, but we do not believe they have reason for existing.&quot;

Zeidler faced the vexing issue of race relations as Milwaukee&#x27;s African-American population tripled during the 1950s. Zeidler was a vocal supporter of the civil rights movement and his opponents tried to exploit this to their advantage. Zeidler&#x27;s political enemies spread false rumors that Zeidler had put billboards in the South asking blacks to come north. Many workers in Milwaukee were threatened for supporting Zeidler. One manufacturer even threatened to fire employees who voted for Zeidler. Zeidler cited bad personal health and the race issue as reasons for not running for re-election in 1960.

A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Zeidler as the twenty-first-best American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993.

== Later years and death ==
After leaving office, Frank Zeidler worked as a mediator, as development director for Alverno College, and served in the administration of Wisconsin Governor John W. Reynolds. As a leader of the Public Enterprise Committee, Zeidler was a frequent and severe critic of his successor, Henry Maier. He supported a number of unsuccessful attempts to defeat Maier in subsequent elections.

Zeidler was instrumental in re-forming the Socialist Party USA in 1973, and served as its National Chair for many years. He was the party&#x27;s presidential nominee in 1976, getting on ten state ballots. The party had 400-600 members nationwide at the time. Zeidler agreed to run when other leading members of the SPUSA declined to do so. He and his running mate, J. Quinn Brisben, received 6,038 votes, including approximately 2,500 in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin.

On July 26, 2004, Zeidler appeared at the 2004 Green Party National Convention in Milwaukee to welcome delegates to the convention.

He died on July 7, 2006, aged 93, and was interred at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee. His mayoral and personal papers are archived at Milwaukee Public Library. Several additional boxes of his papers are archived at the Golda Meir Library of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.

== Writing, scholarship, and legacy ==
Zeidler wrote several books, including not only treatises on municipal government, labor law, socialism, and Milwaukee history, but poetry, renditions of four of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays into present-day English, and children&#x27;s stories. His 1961 memoir of his time as mayor, &quot;A Liberal in City Government&quot;, was published in 2005 by Milwaukee Publishers LLC, a local company formed for the purpose.

On June 13, 1958, Zeidler was the first person to receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, which now sponsors the Frank P. Zeidler International
Graduate Student Travel Award, a scholarship enabling a non-American scholar to study for a master&#x27;s degree in American history at UWM. The Wisconsin Labor History Society also sponsors an annual undergraduate Frank P. Zeidler Scholarship in labor history. 

The Milwaukee Public Library&#x27;s historic collections are housed in the Frank P. Zeidler Humanities Room, named in his honor. 

On May 21, 2006, he received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Cardinal Stritch University in Milwaukee.

An urban park in downtown Milwaukee bears Zeidler&#x27;s name. Zeidler Union Park (originally named for priest and explorer Jacques Marquette) now hosts the Westown Farmer&#x27;s Market and other smaller festivals and gatherings. 

== Family ==
Zeidler&#x27;s daughter, Jeanne Zeidler, served as mayor of Williamsburg, Virginia, from 1998 until 2010, when she retired.

<text>The Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT ( ())) is a computer adaptive test (CAT) intended to assess certain analytical, quantitative, verbal, and data literacy skills for use in admission to a graduate management program, such as a Master of Business Administration (MBA) program. Answering the test questions requires reading comprehension, and mathematical skills such as arithmetic, and algebra. The Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC) owns and operates the test, and states that the GMAT assesses critical thinking and problem-solving abilities while also addressing data analysis skills that it believes to be vital to real-world business and management success. It can be taken up to five times a year but no more than eight times total. Attempts must be at least 16 days apart.

GMAT is a registered trademark of the Graduate Management Admission Council. More than 7,700 programs at approximately 2,400+ graduate business schools around the world accept the GMAT as part of the selection criteria for their programs. Business schools use the test as a criterion for admission into a wide range of graduate management programs, including MBA, Master of Accountancy, Master of Finance programs and others. The GMAT is administered online and in standardized test centers in 114 countries around the world. According to a survey conducted by Kaplan Test Prep, the GMAT is still the number one choice for MBA aspirants. According to GMAC, it has continually performed validity studies to statistically verify that the exam predicts success in business school programs. The number of test-takers of GMAT plummeted from 2012 to 2021 as more students opted for an MBA program that didn&#x27;t require the GMAT. 

==History==
In 1953, the organization now called the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC) began as an association of nine business schools, whose goal was to develop a standardized test to help business schools select qualified applicants. In the first year it was offered, the assessment (now known as the Graduate Management Admission Test), was taken just over 2,000 times; in recent years, it has been taken more than 230,000 times annually. Initially used in admissions by 54 schools, the test is now used by more than 7,700 programs at approximately 2,400 graduate business schools around the world. On June 5, 2012, GMAC introduced an integrated reasoning section to the exam that aims to measure a test taker&#x27;s ability to evaluate information presented in multiple formats from multiple sources. In April 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the closing of in-person testing centers around the world, GMAC quickly moved to launch an online format of the GMAT exam. Starting from January 31, 2024, the previous edition of the GMAT was replaced by the GMAT Exam (Focus Edition). It now consists of three sections: Verbal, Quantitative, and Data Insights, and is graded between 205 and 805 in 5-point intervals. 

==Criticism==
In 2013, an independent research study evaluated student performance at three full-time MBA programs and reported that the GMAT total score had a 0.29 statistical correlation with the first-year GPA (Grade Point Average) of the MBA programs while undergraduate GPA had a 0.35 correlation, suggesting that undergraduate performance was a stronger predictor of graduate school performance than GMAT scores. The AACSB score (a combination of GMAT total score and undergraduate GPA) provided the best predictive power (0.45 correlation) for the first-year performance on MBA core courses.

In 2017, GMAC conducted a large-scale validity study involving 28 graduate business programs, and the results showed that the median correlation between the GMAT Total score and graduate GPA was 0.38, the median correlation between the GMAT IR score and graduate GPA was 0.27, and the median correlation between undergraduate GPA and graduate GPA was 0.32. The results also showed that undergraduate GPA and GMAT scores (i.e., Verbal, Quant, IR, and AWA) jointly had a 0.51 correlation with graduate GPA.

==Format and timing==
The GMAT exam consists of three sections: Quantitative Reasoning, Verbal Reasoning, and Data Insights. The total testing time is two hours and 15 minutes to answer 64 questions, and test takers have 45 minutes for each section.

All three sections of the GMAT exam are multiple-choice and are administered in a computer-adaptive format, adjusting to a test taker&#x27;s level of ability. At the start of each section, test takers are presented with a question of average difficulty. As questions are answered correctly, the computer presents the test taker with increasingly difficult questions, and as questions are answered incorrectly the computer presents the test taker with questions of decreasing difficulty. This process continues until test takers complete each section, at which point the computer will have an accurate assessment of their ability level in that subject area and come up with a raw score for each section.

On July 11, 2017, GMAC announced that from now on the order in which the different parts of the GMAT are taken can be chosen at the beginning of the exam. The three options were:
* Analytical Writing Assessment, Integrated Reasoning, Quantitative, Verbal (original order)
* Verbal, Quantitative, Integrated Reasoning, Analytical Writing Assessment
* Quantitative, Verbal, Integrated Reasoning, Analytical Writing Assessment

In April 2018, the GMAC officially shortened the test by half an hour, shortening the verbal and quantitative sections from 75 minutes each to 65 and 62 minutes, respectively, and shortening some of the instruction screens.

In October 2023, with the launched of the GMAT Exam (Focus Edition), GMAC further shortened the exam and removed the Analytical Writing Assessment section, as well as sentence correction and geometry questions. Additionally, section order selection was expanded, giving test takers the opportunity to take the exam in any order they choose. A Question Review &amp; Edit feature was also introduced, giving test takers the ability to review all answers at the end of each section and edit up to three answers per section.

===Quantitative Reasoning section===
The Quantitative Reasoning section of the GMAT seeks to measure the ability to reason quantitatively and solve quantitative problems. Questions require knowledge of certain algebra and arithmetic. There is only one type of quantitative question: problem-solving and data sufficiency. The use of calculators is not allowed on the quantitative section of the GMAT. Test takers must do their math work out by hand using a wet erase pen and laminated graph paper which are given to them at the testing center. Scores range from 60 to 90.

Problem-solving questions are designed to test the ability to reason quantitatively and to solve quantitative problems.

===Verbal Reasoning section===
The Verbal Reasoning section of the GMAT exam includes the following question types: reading comprehension and critical reasoning. Each question type gives five answer options from which to select. Verbal scores range from 60 to 90.

According to GMAC, the reading comprehension question type tests ability to analyze information and draw a conclusion. Reading comprehension passages can be anywhere from one to several paragraphs long. According to GMAC, the critical reasoning question type assesses reasoning skills.

===Data Insights section===
Data Insights is a section introduced in 2023 and is designed to measure a test taker&#x27;s ability to evaluate data presented in multiple formats from multiple sources. The Data Insights section consists of 20 questions (which often consist of multiple parts themselves) in five different formats: data sufficiency, graphics interpretation, two-part analysis, table analysis, and multi-source reasoning. Data Insights scores range from 60 to 90.

The Data Insights section includes five question types: table analysis, graphics interpretation, multi-source reasoning, two-part analysis, and data sufficiency. In the table analysis section, test takers are presented with a sortable table of information, similar to a spreadsheet, which has to be analyzed. Each question will have several statements with opposite-answer options (e.g., true/false, yes/no), and test takers click on the correct option. Graphics interpretation questions ask test takers to interpret a graph or graphical image. Each question has fill-in-the-blank statements with pull-down menus; test takers must choose the options that make the statements accurate. Multi-source reasoning questions are accompanied by two to three sources of information presented on tabbed pages. Test takers click on the tabs and examine all the relevant information, which may be a combination of text, charts, and tables to answer either traditional multiple-choice or opposite-answer (e.g., yes/no, true/false) questions. Two-part analysis questions involve two components for a solution. Possible answers are given in a table format with a column for each component and rows with possible options. Test takers have to choose one response per column. Data sufficiency is a question type unique to the GMAT designed to measure the ability to understand and analyze a quantitative problem, recognize what information is relevant or irrelevant and determine at what point there is enough information to solve a problem or recognize the fact that there is insufficient information given to solve a particular problem.

== Previous exam sections ==

===Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA)===
No longer part of the GMAT exam, the AWA consisted of a 30-minute writing task—analysis of an argument. It was important to be able to analyze the reasoning behind a given argument and write a critique of that argument. The essay was given two independent ratings and these ratings were averaged together to determine the test taker&#x27;s AWA score. One rating was given by a computerized reading evaluation and another was given by a person at GMAC who will read and score the essay themselves without knowing what the computerized score was. The automated essay-scoring engine was an electronic system that evaluated more than 50 structural and linguistic features, including organization of ideas, syntactic variety, and topical analysis. If the two ratings differed by more than one point, another evaluation by an expert reader was required to resolve the discrepancy and determine the final score.

The Analytical Writing Assessment was graded on a scale of 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum) in half-point intervals. A score of 0 indicates that the response was either nonsensical, off-topic, or completely blank. It did not count toward’s a test taker’s total GMAT score.
===Integrated Reasoning section===
The Integrated Reasoning (IR) was a section introduced in June 2012 and was replaced by Data Insights in 2023. Similar to Data Insights, it was designed to measure a test taker&#x27;s ability to evaluate data presented in multiple formats from multiple sources. The skills tested by the Integrated Reasoning section were identified in a survey of 740 management faculty worldwide as important for incoming students. The Integrated Reasoning section consisted of 12 questions (which often consisted of multiple parts themselves) in four different formats: graphics interpretation, two-part analysis, table analysis, and multi-source reasoning. Integrated Reasoning scores ranged from 1 to 8. Like the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA), this section was scored separately from the Quantitative and Verbal section. Performance on the IR and AWA sections did not contribute to the total GMAT score.

== Scoring ==
The total GMAT Exam (Focus Edition) score ranges from 205 to 805 and measures performance on all three sections together. Scores are given in increments of 10 (e.g. 545, 555, 565, 575, etc.).

In 2023, for the GMAT Exam (Focus Edition), the score scale for the exam was adjusted to reflect changes in the test-taking population, which has become more diverse and global. Over the years, scores had shifted significantly, resulting in an uneven distribution. The updated score scale fixed that, allowing schools to better differentiate performance on the exam.

The final score is not based solely on the last question the examinee answers (i.e. the level of difficulty of questions reached through the computer adaptive presentation of questions). The algorithm used to build a score is more complicated than that. The examinee can make a mistake and answer incorrectly and the computer will recognize that item as an anomaly. If the examinee misses the first question, the final score will not necessarily fall in the bottom half of the range.

At the end of the exam, an unofficial preview of the GMAT score earned is shown to the test taker.

=== Use by high-IQ societies ===
Scores at or above the 99th percentile are accepted as qualifying evidence to join Intertel. According to an official study conducted by the GMAC, a score of at least 760 is required to reach the 99th percentile.

A score of at least 746 qualifies one for admission to the International Society for Philosophical Enquiry, and a score of 750 (with the old pre-2023 test) qualifies for admission to the Triple Nine Society, corresponding to the 98th percentile, despite both societies claiming to only accept members in the 99.9th percentile or above on a test of adult intelligence (i.e. ten times more selective than Intertel, rather than less selective).

<doc id="255236" wikidata="Q548140" url="?curid=255236" title="Eric Temple Bell">
<text>Eric Temple Bell (7 February 1883 – 21 December 1960) was a Scottish-born mathematician, educator and science fiction writer who lived in the United States for most of his life. He published non-fiction using his given name and fiction as John Taine.

==Early life and education==
Eric Temple Bell was born in Peterhead, Aberdeen, Scotland as third of three children to Helen Jane Lyall and James Bell Jr. His father, a factor, relocated to San Jose, California, in 1884, when Eric was fifteen months old. After his father died on 4 January 1896, the family returned to Bedford, England.

Bell was educated at Bedford Modern School, where his teacher Edward Mann Langley inspired him to continue the study of mathematics. Bell returned to the United States, by way of Montreal, in 1902. He received degrees from Stanford University (1904), the University of Washington (1908), and Columbia University (1912) (where he was a student of Cassius Jackson Keyser).

==Career==
Bell was part of the faculty first at the University of Washington and later at the California Institute of Technology. While at the University of Washington, he taught Howard P. Robertson and encouraged him to enroll at Caltech for his doctoral studies.

Bell researched number theory; see in particular Bell series. He attempted—not altogether successfully—to make the traditional umbral calculus (understood at that time to be the same thing as the &quot;symbolic method&quot; of Blissard) logically rigorous. He also did much work using generating functions, treated as formal power series, without concern for convergence. He is the eponym of the Bell polynomials and the Bell numbers of combinatorics.

In 1924 Bell was awarded the Bôcher Memorial Prize for his work in mathematical analysis. In 1927, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1937. He died in 1960 in Watsonville, California.

==Work==
===Fiction and poetry===
During the early 1920s, Bell wrote several long poems. He also wrote several science fiction novels by the pseudonym John Taine, which independently invented some of the earliest devices and ideas of science fiction. His novels later also serialised in magazines. Basil Davenport, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described Taine as &quot;one of the first real scientists to write science-fiction [who] did much to bring it out of the interplanetary cops-and-robbers stage&quot;. But he concluded that &quot;[Taine] is sadly lacking as a novelist, in style and especially in characterization&quot;.

===Writing about mathematics===
Bell wrote a book of biographical essays titled &quot;Men of Mathematics&quot; (one chapter of which was the first popular account of the 19th century mathematician Sofya Kovalevskaya), which is still in print. He originally wrote it under the title &quot;The Lives of Mathematicians&quot;, but the publishers, Simon and Schuster, cut about a third of it (125,000 words), and, in order to tie in with their book &quot;Men of Art&quot; (by Thomas Craven), gave it the title &quot;Men of Mathematics&quot; which he did not like. The book inspired notable mathematicians including Julia Robinson, John Forbes Nash, Jr., and Andrew Wiles to begin careers in mathematics. However, historians of mathematics have disputed the accuracy of much of Bell&#x27;s history. In fact, Bell does not distinguish carefully between anecdote and history. He has been much criticized for romanticizing Évariste Galois. For example: &quot;[E. T.] Bell&#x27;s account [of Galois&#x27;s life], by far the most famous, is also the most fictitious&quot;. His treatment of Georg Cantor, which reduced Cantor&#x27;s relationships with his father and with Leopold Kronecker to stereotypes, has been criticized even more severely.

While this book was under printing, he also wrote and had published another book, &quot;The Handmaiden of the Sciences&quot;. Bell&#x27;s later book &quot;Development of Mathematics&quot; has been less famous, but his biographer Constance Reid finds it has fewer weaknesses.
His book on Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, &quot;The Last Problem&quot;, was published the year after his death and is a hybrid of social history and the history of mathematics. It inspired mathematician Andrew Wiles to solve the problem.

In his book about Paul Erdős, titled &quot;The Man Who Loved Only Numbers&quot;, Paul Hoffman wrote:

<text>Helsinki City Transport or HKL (Finnish: &quot;Helsingin kaupungin liikennelaitos&quot;, Swedish: &quot;Helsingfors stads trafikverk&quot;, abbreviated to &quot;HST&quot;) was the official city-owned public transport company in Helsinki, Finland. It operates the Helsinki Metro. HKL&#x27;s bus operations were merged with another city-owned company, Suomen Turistiauto, to form a new bus company called Helsingin Bussiliikenne, which has since been acquired by Koiviston Auto. Until the founding of HSL in January 2010, HKL was responsible for the planning and organization of all public transport in Helsinki. The majority of HKL&#x27;s operations, excluding certain parts of the Metro operations, were corporatised and moved to Metropolitan Area Transport Ltd in February 2022.
