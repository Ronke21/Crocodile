<text>Oreo (; stylized in all caps) is a brand of sandwich cookie consisting of two cocoa biscuits or cookie pieces with a sweet fondant filling. It was introduced by Nabisco on March 6, 1912, and through a series of corporate acquisitions, mergers, and splits, both Nabisco and the Oreo brand have been owned by Mondelez International since 2012. Oreo cookies are available in over one hundred countries. Many varieties of Oreo cookies have been produced, and limited-edition runs have become popular in the 21st century.

Oreos are an imitation of the Hydrox chocolate cream-centered cookie introduced in 1908, but it outstripped Hydrox in popularity so largely that many believe Hydrox is an imitation of Oreo. Oreo has been the highest-selling cookie brand in the world since 2014.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the name &quot;Oreo&quot; is obscure, but there are many hypotheses, including derivations from the French word , meaning &quot;gold&quot; (the original tin was gold-colored); the Greek word (oros), meaning &quot;mountain&quot; (the cookie was originally conceived to be dome-shaped); or the Greek word () meaning &quot;nice&quot; or &quot;attractive&quot;. Others believe that the cookie was named Oreo simply because the name was short and easy to pronounce. Another theory, proposed by the food writer Stella Parks, is that the name derives from the Greek &quot;Oreodaphne&quot;, a genus of the laurel family, originating from the Greek words &#x27;oreo&#x27; (ωραίο) meaning &#x27;beautiful&#x27; and &#x27;daphne&#x27; (δάφνη) referring to the laurel. She observes that the original design of the Oreo includes a laurel wreath, and the names of several of Nabisco&#x27;s cookies at the time of the original Oreo had botanical derivations, including &quot;Avena&quot;, &quot;Lotus&quot;, and Helicon (from &quot;Heliconia&quot;).

== History ==
=== 20th century ===

The &quot;Oreo Biscuit&quot; was first developed and produced by the National Biscuit Company (today known as Nabisco) in 1912 at its Chelsea, New York City factory in the present-day Chelsea Market complex, located on Ninth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets. In 2002, this same block of Ninth Avenue was ceremoniously named as &quot;Oreo Way&quot;. The name Oreo was trademarked on March 14, 1912. It was launched as an imitation of the original Hydrox cookie manufactured by Sunshine company, which was introduced in 1908.

The original design on the face of the Oreo featured a wreath around the edge of the cookie and the name &quot;OREO&quot; in the center. In the United States, they were sold for a pound (454 g) in novelty metal canisters with clear glass tops. The first Oreo was sold on March 6, 1912, to a grocer in Hoboken, New Jersey.
The Oreo Biscuit was renamed in 1921 to &quot;Oreo Sandwich&quot;; in 1948, the name was changed to &quot;Oreo Crème Sandwich&quot;; and in 1974 it became the &quot;Oreo Chocolate Sandwich Cookie&quot;, the name that has remained to this day. A new design for the face of the cookie was launched in 1924; the modern-day Oreo design was developed in 1952 by William A. Turnier, incorporating the Nabisco logo. In 1920, a second lemon crème-filled variety of the Oreo was introduced, as an alternative to the white crème-filled variety, but this was discontinued in 1924 and the original flavor was the only version available for the next several decades.

The modern Oreo cookie filling was developed by Nabisco&#x27;s principal food scientist, Sam Porcello, who retired from Nabisco in 1993. Porcello held five patents directly related to his work on the Oreo; he also created a range of Oreo cookies that were covered in dark chocolate and white chocolate. In the early 1990s, health concerns prompted Nabisco to replace the lard in the crème filling with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. This also made it possible for the bakery to become kosher-certified, a lengthy and expensive process for Nabisco. Similarly, Oreo cookies are popular with people that have certain dietary restrictions, such as vegans, as the crème filling does not use any animal products. However, there is still a risk of cross-contamination from other dairy-containing products made in the same production areas; in the FAQ section of the Oreo website, on the question of whether Oreo cookies are suitable for vegans, the response is &quot;Many Oreo products are suitable for vegans but may include cross-contaminants of milk, so please check allergen advice.&quot;

=== 21st century ===

In January 2006, Nabisco and its parent (at the time) Kraft Foods eliminated the trans fat in the Oreo cookie and replaced it with non-hydrogenated vegetable oil as one of the main ingredients for Oreo cookies in general.

In June 2012, Oreo posted an advertisement displaying an Oreo cookie with rainbow-colored crème to celebrate LGBT Pride month; the cookie itself was fictional and was not being manufactured or made available for sale. The advertisement prompted some negative comments from conservatives, but Kraft stood by their promotion, stating that &quot;Kraft Foods has a proud history of celebrating diversity and inclusiveness. We feel the Oreo ad is a fun reflection of our values.&quot; This was followed during 2012 by a series of adverts commemorating other holidays and events, including a blue, white, and red crème Oreo to honor Bastille Day, a stream of cookie crumbs marking the appearance of the Delta Aquariids meteor shower, and a cookie with a jagged bite taken out of it to promote Shark Week on Discovery Channel.

When the power went out during Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, the Oreo marketing team tweeted &quot;you can still dunk in the dark&quot; from its social media command center; this was retweeted almost 15,000 times and increased Oreo&#x27;s count of Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram followers. One commentator remarked that this &quot;solidified the viability and necessity of real-time marketing&quot;.

According to an April 2022 research report published in the journal &quot;Physics of Fluids&quot;, it was proven impossible to split the cream filling of an Oreo cookie down the middle. The filling always adheres to one side of the wafer, no matter how quickly the cookie is twisted.

== International distribution ==
Oreo cookies are distributed worldwide through a variety of sales and marketing channels. As their popularity continues to grow, so too does the amount of distribution that comes with it. According to the Kraft Foods company, the Oreo is the &quot;World&#x27;s Best Selling Cookie&quot;. In March 2012, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that Oreo cookies were available in more than 100 countries. Overall, it is estimated that since the Oreo cookie&#x27;s inception in 1912, over 450 billion Oreos have been produced worldwide.

Oreos were first introduced into Britain through the supermarket chain Sainsbury&#x27;s. For several years, this was the only supermarket chain in the UK to stock the Oreo until May 2008, when Kraft decided to fully launch the Oreo across the whole of the UK. Its packaging was redesigned into the more familiar British tube design, accompanied by a £4.5M television advertising campaign based around the &quot;twist, lick, dunk&quot; catchphrase. In a 2020 national poll the Oreo was ranked the 16th most popular biscuit in the UK, with McVitie&#x27;s chocolate digestive topping the list.

In the UK, Kraft partnered with McDonald&#x27;s to introduce the Oreo McFlurry (which was already on sale in several other countries, including the US) into McDonald&#x27;s locations across the country during its annual &quot;Great Tastes of America&quot; promotions; in October 2015, the Oreo McFlurry then became a permanent menu item at McDonald&#x27;s in the UK. An Oreo-flavored &quot;Krushem&quot; drink was also on sale in KFC stores across Britain.

The ingredients of the British Oreo (as listed on the UK Oreo website) are slightly different from those of the US Oreo. Unlike the US version, the British Oreo originally contained whey powder, which was not suitable for people with lactose intolerance. Additionally, as the whey powder was sourced from cheese made with calf rennet, the British version was also unsuitable for vegetarians. On December 6, 2011, Kraft announced that production of Oreo was to start in the UK with their Cadbury Trebor Bassett factory in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, being selected to manufacture Oreo in Britain for the first time. Production began there in May 2013.

Oreo cookies were introduced onto the Indian market by Cadbury India in 2011. In Pakistan, Oreo is manufactured and sold by Continental Biscuits Limited under the LU brand. In Japan, Oreo and other Nabisco products were produced by Yamazaki Baking until Mondelez terminated their licensing deal in favor of moving production to China. A year later, Yamazaki introduced their version of Oreo called &quot;Noir&quot;, which is produced at the former Oreo factory in Ibaraki Prefecture.

== Production ==
By 2017, more than 40 billion Oreo cookies were being produced annually in 18 countries around the world. Oreo cookies for the Asian markets are manufactured in India, Indonesia, Bahrain, and China. Oreo cookies for the European market are made in Spain and at the Cadbury factory in the UK; they are made in Russia (Mondelēz Rus) for consumers in several CIS countries; and those sold in Australia are manufactured in Indonesia, China or Bahrain, depending on the flavor. The version produced in Canada (sold under the Christie&#x27;s brand) included coconut oil but as of 2023, the ingredient list included vegetable oil and modified palm oil, similar to the American cookies. Manufacture of Oreo biscuits began in Pakistan in early 2014, in collaboration with Mondelez International of the United States and Continental Biscuits Limited (CBL) of Pakistan, at the CBL production plant in Sukkur.

=== Oreo boycott ===

In 2015, Mondelez announced its decision to close some of its American factories and move production to Mexico, prompting the Oreo boycott. In 2016, after production had started in Mexico, the AFL–CIO encouraged the boycott and published consumer guidance to help identify which Mondelez products were made in Mexico.

== Ingredients ==
The ingredients of Oreo cookies have remained largely unchanged from the original, although numerous alternative varieties and flavors have emerged over time. Oreo cookies were made with lard until the mid-1990s, when Nabisco swapped the animal fat with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. Then in the mid-2000s Nabisco eliminated the partially hydrogenated oil from the ingredients, due to growing health concerns. The classic Oreo cookie is made using eleven main ingredients:

# Sugar
# Unbleached enriched flour (wheat flour, niacin, iron, thiamine mono-nitrate (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folic acid)
# High oleic canola oil or palm oil
# Cocoa (treated with alkali)
# High-fructose corn syrup
# Leavening agent (baking soda or monocalcium phosphate)
# Corn starch
# Salt
# Soy lecithin
# Vanillin
# Chocolate

== Varieties ==
In addition to their traditional design of two chocolate wafers separated by a crème filling, Oreo cookies have been produced in a multitude of different varieties since they were first introduced. This list is only a guide to some of the more notable and popular types; not all are available in every country. The main varieties in the United States are:
* &quot;Double Stuf Oreo&quot; – Introduced in 1974, this variety has about double the normal amount of crème filling as the original. Available with various flavors of crème filling: original, chocolate, peanut butter, cool mint, and birthday cake. In the UK these are called &quot;Double Creme Oreos&quot; and are only available in original flavor. The &quot;Golden Double Stuf Oreo&quot;, featuring golden Oreo wafers with a double portion of original vanilla-flavored crème, was introduced in 2009.
* &quot;Football Oreo&quot; – Gridiron football-shaped Oreo cookies, introduced in 1976.
* &quot;Big Stuf Oreo&quot; – A short-lived variety of the Oreo cookie, introduced in 1987 but discontinued in 1991, these were several times the size of a normal Oreo. Sold individually, each &quot;Big Stuf&quot; contained and 13 grams of fat.
* &quot;Golden Oreo&quot; – Introduced in 2004, this has &quot;golden&quot; vanilla-flavored wafers on the outside of the cookie, as an alternative to the original chocolate-flavored wafers. Available with various flavors of crème filling including original, chocolate, lemon and birthday cake. The chocolate crème variety, being the reverse of the original cookie, was known as the &quot;Uh-Oh Oreo&quot; until 2007.
* &quot;Oreo Mini&quot; – Introduced in 1991, these are miniature bite-sized versions of the original Oreo cookie. After being discontinued in the late 1990s, they were re-released in 2000 along with the redesigned 2001 Dodge Caravan minivan as part of a promotional tie-in with Daimler AG. Their packaging in the 1990s consisted of a &quot;miniaturized&quot; version of the full-sized cardboard tray and box used in Oreo packaging at the time. Their revised packaging consists of an aluminum foil bag. &quot;Oreo Minis&quot; are available with various flavors of crème filling including original, chocolate, strawberry, and the new mint flavor which debuted in 2015. As well as the bagged version, they are also sold in Nabisco To-Go Cups, lidded plastic cups which fit into car cup-holders.
* &quot;Oreo Cakesters&quot; – Introduced in 2007, Oreo Cakesters are Oreo&#x27;s version of a whoopie pie, soft chocolate snack cakes with vanilla, chocolate or peanut butter creme in the middle. They were discontinued in 2012. They returned in 2022 after a petition was started to have them brought back. The same year, Nabisco announced that Cakesters would be making a return in 2022, including Oreo and Nutter Butter varieties.
* &quot;Mega Stuf Oreo&quot; – Released in February 2013, the &quot;Mega Stuf&quot; variety is similar to &quot;Double Stuf&quot;, but with even more white crème filling. They come in both chocolate and golden wafer varieties.
* &quot;Oreo Thins&quot; – Introduced in July 2015, this is a thin version of the original Oreo cookie. &quot;Thins&quot; come in both chocolate and golden wafer varieties, with various crème flavors including chocolate, mint, lemon and tiramisu. Each cookie contains only 40 calories; they are 66% thinner than the original version.
* &quot;Chocolate Oreo&quot; – An Oreo cookie with chocolate crème filling.
* &quot;Mint Oreo&quot; – A variety of Oreo with two chocolate wafers separated by a mint-flavored crème filling.
* &quot;The Most Stuf&quot; – Introduced in January 2019, an initially limited edition Oreo with approximately four times the amount of crème filling of a standard Oreo. After two limited runs, it was quietly brought back as a permanent product in late 2020. While they were first offered in traditional Oreo packages and widely available when they were limited edition, the permanent version is only found in individual four-packs as well as 12 four-pack collections within convenience store settings.
* &quot;Gluten Free&quot; – Introduced in January 2021, available in both traditional and Double Stuf varieties

Special edition &quot;Double Stuf Oreo&quot; cookies are produced during springtime, and around Halloween and Christmas. These have colored frosting reflecting the current holiday: blue or yellow for springtime; orange for Halloween; and red or green for the Christmas holiday. One side of each seasonal cookie is stamped with an appropriate design; the spring cookies feature flowers, butterflies, etc., while the Halloween editions feature a jack o&#x27;lantern, ghost, cat, flock of bats, or broom-riding witch. The 2017 &quot;Halloween Oreo&quot; broke with this tradition, having orange-colored crème filling (albeit with classic vanilla flavor) but carrying no seasonal designs.

In some countries, Oreos come in a variety of flavors that are not familiar to the U.S. market. For example, &quot;Green Tea Oreos&quot; are only available in China and Japan, while &quot;Lemon Ice Oreos&quot; were only ever introduced in Japan or &quot;Blueberry Ice Cream&quot; available in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Additionally, there are alfajor Oreo cookies available in Argentina, composed of three Oreo cookies with vanilla filling between each, and covered in chocolate.

=== Limited editions ===

Beginning in the early 2010s, Nabisco began releasing limited edition runs of cookies with more exotic flavors. These typically appear in stores for a short period only, before being discontinued, although some varieties have since resurfaced, for example: Reese&#x27;s Oreos returned for a second limited run after they were first introduced for a limited period in 2014; and Birthday Cake Oreos, originally introduced in 2012, have since become permanently available. Some limited editions are only made available at certain retailers.

Limited-edition runs usually feature a crème filling that has been flavored to replicate the taste of a specific fruit or dessert, from familiar flavors such as lemon or mint, to the more specific and unusual flavors of blueberry pie or red velvet cake. They may also incorporate different varieties of cookie wafer, for example Cinnamon-Bun Oreos featured cinnamon-flavored wafers and &quot;frosting-flavored crème&quot;. In recent years, some limited editions have paired Oreos with other recognizable confectionery brands, including Reese&#x27;s, Swedish Fish, and Peeps.

Oreo&#x27;s six-person team in charge of special flavors is extremely secretive; the company will not disclose even the group&#x27;s name. The limited-edition flavors largely serve as advertising for Oreo&#x27;s regular varieties.
== Advertising campaigns ==

=== You Can Still Dunk in the Dark ===
When the lights went out during Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, Oreo immediately parodied the event on social media with a &quot;You Can Still Dunk in the Dark&quot; post. The post earned 15,000 retweets and 20,000 Facebook likes in an hour.

=== Oreo Daily Twist ===
Oreo Daily was a social media campaign celebrating Oreo&#x27;s 100th birthday. Every day, from June 25 to October 2, Oreo posted ads of their cookies transformed into something new to celebrate national holidays, pop culture milestone, and key moments in American history. Using reinvented Oreo cookies, ads in the campaign honored the Mars rover landing, Elvis week, the invention of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, and the release of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; in theaters.

=== Dunk Challenge ===
In 2017, NBA player Shaquille O&#x27;Neal starred in an Oreo commercial to promote their #OreoDunkSweepstakes. In the ad, O&#x27;Neal can be seen performing an acrobatic slam dunk of an Oreo cookie into a glass of milk. Fans could show off their own dunking abilities for the chance to win prizes.

=== Global Oreo Vault ===

In October 2020, Nabisco announced on social media that it had created a small concrete bunker in Svalbard, Norway to preserve the Oreo recipe in the event that the 2018 VP1 asteroid impacted the Earth on November 2 or 3, 2020.

==Use of the word &quot;Oreo&quot; as a slur==
Oreo cookies, due to their almost-black cookies and white filling, have often been used in popular culture as a metaphor for relations between African Americans and White Americans.

=== Applied to a single person ===
The term &quot;Oreo&quot; has occasionally been used as a racial slur aimed at a person of mixed-race or African-American heritage who is accused of trying to act white. The insult may be levied as an accusation that the person perpetuates the &quot;un-level playing field for blacks&quot;, and is based on the implication that the person is like the cookie, &quot;black on the outside and white on the inside&quot;. For example, the protagonist of the 1974 novel, &quot;Oreo&quot;, was nicknamed Oreo because of a mixed Jewish-American and African-American heritage. Former American president Barack Obama, due to his biracial heritage, has been compared to an Oreo by political pundits and television personalities such as John McLaughlin and Rush Limbaugh.

In 2021, the chair of the Lamar County Democrats, Gary O&#x27;Connor, compared South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, the only African-American Republican in the United States Senate, to an Oreo after Scott gave the Republican response to Joe Biden&#x27;s joint address to Congress. Amid fierce criticism, O&#x27;Connor apologized for his remarks and offered his resignation, but the Lamar County Democrats chose not to accept his resignation and O&#x27;Connor wrote a public letter of apology for his remarks.

=== Applied to three people ===
In the 1976 movie, &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, Barbra Streisand&#x27;s character Esther Hoffman is the white central member of The Oreos, a three-girl singing group, between black actresses Venetta Fields and Clydie King.

<doc id="241563" wikidata="Q282744" url="?curid=241563" title="Obsolescence">
<text>Obsolescence is the process of becoming antiquated, out of date, old-fashioned, no longer in general use, or no longer useful, or the condition of being in such a state. When used in a biological sense, it means imperfect or rudimentary when compared with the corresponding part of other organisms. The international standard IEC 62402:2019 Obsolescence Management defines obsolescence as the &quot;transition from available to unavailable from the manufacturer in accordance with the original specification&quot;.

Obsolescence frequently occurs because a replacement has become available that has, in sum, more advantages compared to the disadvantages incurred by maintaining or repairing the original. Obsolete also refers to something that is already disused or discarded, or antiquated. Typically, obsolescence is preceded by a gradual decline in popularity.

==Consequences==
Driven by rapid technological changes, new components are developed and launched on the market with increasing speed. The result is a dramatic change in production methods of all components and their market availability. A growing industry sector is facing issues where life cycles of products no longer fit together with life cycles of required components. This issue is known as obsolescence, the status given to a part when it is no longer available from its original manufacturer. The problem of obsolescence is most prevalent for electronics technology, wherein the procurement lifetimes for microelectronic parts are often significantly shorter than the manufacturing and support life cycles for the products that use the parts. However, obsolescence extends beyond electronic components to other items, such as materials, textiles, and mechanical parts. In addition, obsolescence has been shown to appear for software, specifications, standards, processes, and soft resources, such as human skills. It is highly important to implement and operate an active management of obsolescence to mitigate and avoid extreme costs.

==Types==

===Technical obsolescence===

Technical obsolescence usually occurs when a new product or technology supersedes the old one, and it is preferred to use the new technology instead. Historical examples of new technologies superseding old ones include bronze replacing flint in hand-tools, DVDs replacing videocassettes, and the telephone replacing the telegraph. On a smaller scale, a particular product may become obsolete when a newer version replaces it. Many products in the computer industry become obsolete in this manner. For example, central processing units (CPUs) frequently become obsolete in favor of newer, faster units. Singularly, rapid obsolescence of data formats along with their supporting hardware and software can lead to loss of critical information, a process known as digital obsolescence.

In many cases, a new technology does not totally replace the old technology because the old technology is still useful in certain applications. For example, transistors replaced vacuum tubes in TV and radio receivers in the 1960s, but vacuum tubes were still used for powerful transmitters because transistors for these power levels were not available. Even today, one has to use multiple transistors for a purpose that used to require just one tube. 

Products may also become obsolete when supporting technologies are no longer available to produce or even repair a product. For example, many integrated circuits, including CPUs, memory and even some relatively simple logic chips may no longer be produced because the technology has been superseded, their original developer has gone out of business or a competitor has bought them out and effectively killed off their products to remove competition. It is rarely worth redeveloping a product to get around these issues since its overall functionality and price/performance ratio has usually been superseded by that time as well.

Some products become technologically obsolete due to changes in complementary products which results in the function of the first product being made unnecessary. For example, buggy whips became obsolete when people started to travel in cars rather than in horse-drawn buggies.

=== Functional obsolescence ===

Items become functionally obsolete when they can no longer adequately perform the function for which they were created. For example, while one could theoretically adapt an Avro Lancaster to deploy modern JDAM bombs, the situations in which it could actually succeed at doing so against modern air defenses would be so few that it would be essentially useless.

Manufacturers and repair companies will typically cease support for products once they become obsolete as keeping production lines in place and parts in storage for a shrinking user base becomes unprofitable. This causes scarcity of spare parts and skilled technicians for repairs and thus escalates maintenance costs for obsolete products. This ultimately leads to prohibitive expense in keeping old technology functioning.

=== Architectural obsolescence ===
The term &quot;obsolescence&quot; was first applied to the built environment in 1910 in an attempt to explain American skyscrapers&#x27; sudden loss of value. New York engineer Reginald P. Bolton attributed this phenomenon to &quot;something new and better out-competing the old&quot; and calculated the average architectural lifespan of varying building types in order to formulate a rough estimate for their impending obsolescence. For example, he suggested that hotels&#x27; obsolescence will occur faster than banks due to their ever-changing functions and tastes.

===Planned obsolescence===

Sometimes marketers deliberately introduce obsolescence into their product strategy, with the objective of generating long-term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases. One example might be producing an appliance which is deliberately designed to wear out within five years of its purchase, pushing consumers to replace it within five years.

===Inventory obsolescence===
Inventory obsolescence occurs when retailers and other vendors hold stocks for anticipated future sales which turn out to be too slow to materialise. Holding excessive levels of stock or over-predicting potential demand increase the risks of products becoming obsolete and have a detrimental effect on the organisation&#x27;s cash flow. Companies may address this problem alongside a periodic stock count by assessing which of their stock items are slow-moving or not selling at all.

===Style obsolescence===

When a product is no longer desirable because it has gone out of the popular fashion, its style is obsolete. One example is flared leg jeans; although this article of clothing may still be perfectly functional, it is no longer desirable because style trends have moved away from the flared leg cut.

Because of the &quot;fashion cycle&quot;, stylistically obsolete products may eventually regain popularity and cease to be obsolete. An example is &quot;acid-wash&quot; jeans, which were popular in the 1980s, became stylistically obsolete in the mid to late 1990s, and returned to popularity in the 2000s.

===Moral obsolescence===
===Obsolescence management===
Obsolescence management, also referred to as &quot;Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages&quot; (DMSMS), is defined as to the activities that are undertaken to mitigate the effects of obsolescence. Activities can include last-time buys, lifetime buys, and obsolescence monitoring.

<doc id="241564" wikidata="Q407716" url="?curid=241564" title="Nitrogen triiodide">
<text>Nitrogen triiodide is an inorganic compound with the formula NI3. It is an extremely sensitive contact explosive: small quantities explode with a loud, sharp snap when touched even lightly, releasing a purple cloud of iodine vapor; it can even be detonated by alpha radiation. NI3 has a complex structural chemistry that is difficult to study because of the instability of the derivatives.

==Structure of NI3 and its derivatives==
Nitrogen triiodide was first characterized by Raman spectroscopy in 1990, when it was prepared by an ammonia-free route. Boron nitride reacts with iodine monofluoride in trichlorofluoromethane at −30 °C to produce pure NI3 in low yield:

:BN + 3 IF → NI3 + BF3

NI3 is pyramidal (C3v molecular symmetry), as are the other nitrogen trihalides and ammonia.

The material that is usually called &quot;nitrogen triiodide&quot; is prepared by the reaction of iodine with ammonia. When this reaction is conducted at low temperatures in anhydrous ammonia, the initial product is NI3 · (NH3)5, but this material loses some ammonia upon warming to give the 1:1 adduct NI3 · NH3. This adduct was first reported by Bernard Courtois in 1812, and its formula was finally determined in 1905 by Oswald Silberrad. Its solid state structure consists of chains of -NI2-I-NI2-I-NI2-I-. Ammonia molecules are situated between the chains. When kept cold in the dark and damp with ammonia, NI3 · NH3 is stable.

==Decomposition and explosiveness==
The instability of NI3 and NI3 · NH3 can be attributed to the large steric strain caused by the three large iodine atoms being held in proximity to each other around the relatively tiny nitrogen atom. This results in a very low activation energy for its decomposition, a reaction made even more favorable due to the great stability of N2. Nitrogen triiodide has no practical commercial value due to its extreme shock sensitivity, making it impossible to store, transport, and utilize for controlled explosions. Whereas pure nitroglycerin is powerful and also greatly shock-sensitive (although not nearly as much so as nitrogen triiodide, which can be set off with the touch of a feather), it was only due to phlegmatizers that nitroglycerin&#x27;s shock sensitivity was reduced and it became safer to handle and transport in the form of dynamite.

The decomposition of NI3 proceeds as follows to give nitrogen gas and iodine:
:2 NI3 (s) → N2 (g) + 3 I2 (g) (−290 kJ/mol)

However, the dry material is a contact explosive, decomposing approximately as follows:
: 8 NI3 · NH3 → 5 N2 + 6 NH4I + 9 I2

Consistent with this equation, these explosions leave orange-to-purple stains of iodine, which can be removed with sodium thiosulfate solution. An alternate method of stain removal is to simply allow the iodine time to sublime.
Small amounts of nitrogen triiodide are sometimes synthesized as a demonstration to high school chemistry students or as an act of &quot;chemical magic.&quot; To highlight the sensitivity of the compound, it is usually detonated by touching it with a feather, but even the slightest air current, laser light, or other movement can cause detonation. Nitrogen triiodide is also notable for being the only known chemical explosive that detonates when exposed to alpha particles and nuclear fission products.

<text>A complete blood count (CBC), also known as a full blood count (FBC), is a set of medical laboratory tests that provide information about the cells in a person&#x27;s blood. The CBC indicates the counts of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets, the concentration of hemoglobin, and the hematocrit (the volume percentage of red blood cells). The red blood cell indices, which indicate the average size and hemoglobin content of red blood cells, are also reported, and a white blood cell differential, which counts the different types of white blood cells, may be included.

The CBC is often carried out as part of a medical assessment and can be used to monitor health or diagnose diseases. The results are interpreted by comparing them to reference ranges, which vary with sex and age. Conditions like anemia and thrombocytopenia are defined by abnormal complete blood count results. The red blood cell indices can provide information about the cause of a person&#x27;s anemia such as iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency, and the results of the white blood cell differential can help to diagnose viral, bacterial and parasitic infections and blood disorders like leukemia. Not all results falling outside of the reference range require medical intervention.

The CBC is usually performed by an automated hematology analyzer, which counts cells and collects information on their size and structure. The concentration of hemoglobin is measured, and the red blood cell indices are calculated from measurements of red blood cells and hemoglobin. Manual tests can be used to independently confirm abnormal results. Approximately 10–25% of samples require a manual blood smear review, in which the blood is stained and viewed under a microscope to verify that the analyzer results are consistent with the appearance of the cells and to look for abnormalities. The hematocrit can be determined manually by centrifuging the sample and measuring the proportion of red blood cells, and in laboratories without access to automated instruments, blood cells are counted under the microscope using a hemocytometer.

In 1852, Karl Vierordt published the first procedure for performing a blood count, which involved spreading a known volume of blood on a microscope slide and counting every cell. The invention of the hemocytometer in 1874 by Louis-Charles Malassez simplified the microscopic analysis of blood cells, and in the late 19th century, Paul Ehrlich and Dmitri Leonidovich Romanowsky developed techniques for staining white and red blood cells that are still used to examine blood smears. Automated methods for measuring hemoglobin were developed in the 1920s, and Maxwell Wintrobe introduced the Wintrobe hematocrit method in 1929, which in turn allowed him to define the red blood cell indices. A landmark in the automation of blood cell counts was the Coulter principle, which was patented by Wallace H. Coulter in 1953. The Coulter principle uses electrical impedance measurements to count blood cells and determine their sizes; it is a technology that remains in use in many automated analyzers. Further research in the 1970s involved the use of optical measurements to count and identify cells, which enabled the automation of the white blood cell differential.

==Purpose==
Blood is composed of a fluid portion, called plasma, and a cellular portion that contains red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. The complete blood count evaluates the three cellular components of blood. Some medical conditions, such as anemia or thrombocytopenia, are defined by marked increases or decreases in blood cell counts. Changes in many organ systems may affect the blood, so CBC results are useful for investigating a wide range of conditions. Because of the amount of information it provides, the complete blood count is one of the most commonly performed medical laboratory tests.

The CBC is often used to screen for diseases as part of a medical assessment. It is also called for when a healthcare provider suspects a person has a disease that affects blood cells, such as an infection, a bleeding disorder, or some cancers. People who have been diagnosed with disorders that may cause abnormal CBC results or who are receiving treatments that can affect blood cell counts may have a regular CBC performed to monitor their health, and the test is often performed each day on people who are hospitalized. The results may indicate a need for a blood or platelet transfusion.

The complete blood count has specific applications in many medical specialties. It is often performed before a person undergoes surgery to detect anemia, ensure that platelet levels are sufficient, and screen for infection, as well as after surgery, so that blood loss can be monitored. In emergency medicine, the CBC is used to investigate numerous symptoms, such as fever, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath, and to assess bleeding and trauma. Blood counts are closely monitored in people undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy for cancer, because these treatments suppress the production of blood cells in the bone marrow and can produce severely low levels of white blood cells, platelets and hemoglobin. Regular CBCs are necessary for people taking some psychiatric drugs, such as clozapine and carbamazepine, which in rare cases can cause a life-threatening drop in the number of white blood cells (agranulocytosis). Because anemia during pregnancy can result in poorer outcomes for the mother and her baby, the complete blood count is a routine part of prenatal care; and in newborn babies, a CBC may be needed to investigate jaundice or to count the number of immature cells in the white blood cell differential, which can be an indicator of sepsis.

The complete blood count is an essential tool of hematology, which is the study of the cause, prognosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases related to blood. The results of the CBC and smear examination reflect the functioning of the hematopoietic system—the organs and tissues involved in the production and development of blood cells, particularly the bone marrow. For example, a low count of all three cell types (pancytopenia) can indicate that blood cell production is being affected by a marrow disorder, and a bone marrow examination can further investigate the cause. Abnormal cells on the blood smear might indicate acute leukemia or lymphoma, while an abnormally high count of neutrophils or lymphocytes, in combination with indicative symptoms and blood smear findings, may raise suspicion of a myeloproliferative disorder or lymphoproliferative disorder. Examination of the CBC results and blood smear can help to distinguish between causes of anemia, such as nutritional deficiencies, bone marrow disorders, acquired hemolytic anemias and inherited conditions like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia.

The reference ranges for the complete blood count represent the range of results found in 95% of apparently healthy people. By definition, 5% of results will always fall outside this range, so some abnormal results may reflect natural variation rather than signifying a medical issue. This is particularly likely if such results are only slightly outside the reference range, if they are consistent with previous results, or if there are no other related abnormalities shown by the CBC. When the test is performed on a relatively healthy population, the number of clinically insignificant abnormalities may exceed the number of results that represent disease. For this reason, professional organizations in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada recommend against pre-operative CBC testing for low-risk surgeries in individuals without relevant medical conditions. Repeated blood draws for hematology testing in hospitalized patients can contribute to hospital-acquired anemia and may result in unnecessary transfusions.

== Procedure ==

The sample is collected by drawing blood into a tube containing an anticoagulant—typically EDTA—to stop its natural clotting. The blood is usually taken from a vein, but when this is difficult it may be collected from capillaries by a fingerstick, or by a heelprick in babies. Testing is typically performed on an automated analyzer, but manual techniques such as a blood smear examination or manual hematocrit test can be used to investigate abnormal results. Cell counts and hemoglobin measurements are performed manually in laboratories lacking access to automated instruments.

===Automated===
On board the analyzer, the sample is agitated to evenly distribute the cells, then diluted and partitioned into at least two channels, one of which is used to count red blood cells and platelets, the other to count white blood cells and determine the hemoglobin concentration. Some instruments measure hemoglobin in a separate channel, and additional channels may be used for differential white blood cell counts, reticulocyte counts and specialized measurements of platelets. The cells are suspended in a fluid stream and their properties are measured as they flow past sensors in a technique known as flow cytometry. Hydrodynamic focusing may be used to isolate individual cells so that more accurate results can be obtained: the diluted sample is injected into a stream of low-pressure fluid, which causes the cells in the sample to line up in single file through laminar flow.
To measure the hemoglobin concentration, a reagent chemical is added to the sample to destroy (lyse) the red cells in a channel separate from that used for red blood cell counts. On analyzers that perform white blood cell counts in the same channel as hemoglobin measurement, this permits white blood cells to be counted more easily. Hematology analyzers measure hemoglobin using spectrophotometry and are based on the linear relationship between the absorbance of light and the amount of hemoglobin present. Chemicals are used to convert different forms of hemoglobin, such as oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin, to one stable form, usually cyanmethemoglobin, and to create a permanent colour change. The absorbance of the resulting colour, when measured at a specific wavelength—usually 540 nanometres—corresponds with the concentration of hemoglobin.

Sensors count and identify the cells in the sample using two main principles: electrical impedance and light scattering. Impedance-based cell counting operates on the Coulter principle: cells are suspended in a fluid carrying an electric current, and as they pass through a small opening (an aperture), they cause decreases in current because of their poor electrical conductivity. The amplitude of the voltage pulse generated as a cell crosses the aperture correlates with the amount of fluid displaced by the cell, and thus the cell&#x27;s volume, while the total number of pulses correlates with the number of cells in the sample. The distribution of cell volumes is plotted on a histogram, and by setting volume thresholds based on the typical sizes of each type of cell, the different cell populations can be identified and counted.

In light scattering techniques, light from a laser or a tungsten-halogen lamp is directed at the stream of cells to collect information about their size and structure. Cells scatter light at different angles as they pass through the beam, which is detected using photometers. Forward scatter, which refers to the amount of light scattered along the beam&#x27;s axis, is mainly caused by diffraction of light and correlates with cellular size, while side scatter (light scattered at a 90-degree angle) is caused by reflection and refraction and provides information about cellular complexity.

Radiofrequency-based methods can be used in combination with impedance. These techniques work on the same principle of measuring the interruption in current as cells pass through an aperture, but since the high-frequency RF current penetrates into the cells, the amplitude of the resulting pulse relates to factors like the relative size of the nucleus, the nucleus&#x27;s structure, and the amount of granules in the cytoplasm. Small red cells and cellular debris, which are similar in size to platelets, may interfere with the platelet count, and large platelets may not be counted accurately, so some analyzers use additional techniques to measure platelets, such as fluorescent staining, multi-angle light scatter and monoclonal antibody tagging.

Most analyzers directly measure the average size of red blood cells, which is called the mean cell volume (MCV), and calculate the hematocrit by multiplying the red blood cell count by the MCV. Some measure the hematocrit by comparing the total volume of red blood cells to the volume of blood sampled, and derive the MCV from the hematocrit and red blood cell count. The hemoglobin concentration, the red blood cell count and the hematocrit are used to calculate the average amount of hemoglobin within each red blood cell, the mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH); and its concentration, the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Another calculation, the red blood cell distribution width (RDW), is derived from the standard deviation of the mean cell volume and reflects variation in cellular size.
After being treated with reagents, white blood cells form three distinct peaks when their volumes are plotted on a histogram. These peaks correspond roughly to populations of granulocytes, lymphocytes, and other mononuclear cells, allowing a three-part differential to be performed based on cell volume alone. More advanced analyzers use additional techniques to provide a five- to seven-part differential, such as light scattering or radiofrequency analysis, or using dyes to stain specific chemicals inside cells—for example, nucleic acids, which are found in higher concentrations in immature cells or myeloperoxidase, an enzyme found in cells of the myeloid lineage. Basophils may be counted in a separate channel where a reagent destroys other white cells and leaves basophils intact. The data collected from these measurements is analyzed and plotted on a scattergram, where it forms clusters that correlate with each white blood cell type. Another approach to automating the differential count is the use of digital microscopy software, which uses artificial intelligence to classify white blood cells from photomicrographs of the blood smear. The cell images are displayed to a human operator, who can manually re-classify the cells if necessary.

Most analyzers take less than a minute to run all the tests in the complete blood count. Because analyzers sample and count many individual cells, the results are very precise. However, some abnormal cells may not be identified correctly, requiring manual review of the instrument&#x27;s results and identification by other means of abnormal cells the instrument could not categorize.

====Point-of-care testing====
Point-of-care testing refers to tests conducted outside of the laboratory setting, such as at a person&#x27;s bedside or in a clinic. This method of testing is faster and uses less blood than conventional methods, and does not require specially trained personnel, so it is useful in emergency situations and in areas with limited access to resources. Commonly used devices for point-of-care hematology testing include the HemoCue, a portable analyzer that uses spectrophotometry to measure the hemoglobin concentration of the sample, and the i-STAT, which derives a hemoglobin reading by estimating the concentration of red blood cells from the conductivity of the blood. Hemoglobin and hematocrit can be measured on point-of-care devices designed for blood gas testing, but these measurements sometimes correlate poorly with those obtained through standard methods. There are simplified versions of hematology analyzers designed for use in clinics that can provide a complete blood count and differential.

===Manual===

The tests can be performed manually when automated equipment is not available or when the analyzer results indicate that further investigation is needed. Automated results are flagged for manual blood smear review in 10–25% of cases, which may be due to abnormal cell populations that the analyzer cannot properly count, internal flags generated by the analyzer that suggest the results could be inaccurate, or numerical results that fall outside set thresholds. To investigate these issues, blood is spread on a microscope slide, stained with a Romanowsky stain, and examined under a microscope. The appearance of the red and white blood cells and platelets is assessed, and qualitative abnormalities are reported if present. Changes in the appearance of red blood cells can have considerable diagnostic significance—for example, the presence of sickle cells is indicative of sickle cell disease, and a high number of fragmented red blood cells (schistocytes) requires urgent investigation as it can suggest a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. In some inflammatory conditions and in paraprotein disorders like multiple myeloma, high levels of protein in the blood may cause red blood cells to appear stacked together on the smear, which is termed rouleaux. Some parasitic diseases, such as malaria and babesiosis, can be detected by finding the causative organisms on the blood smear, and the platelet count can be estimated from the blood smear, which is useful if the automated platelet count is inaccurate.

To perform a manual white blood cell differential, the microscopist counts 100 cells on the blood smear and classifies them based on their appearance; sometimes 200 cells are counted. This gives the percentage of each type of white blood cell, and by multiplying these percentages by the total number of white blood cells, the absolute number of each type of white cell can be obtained. Manual counting is subject to sampling error because so few cells are counted compared with automated analysis, but it can identify abnormal cells that analyzers cannot, such as the blast cells seen in acute leukemia. Clinically significant features like toxic granulation and vacuolation can also be ascertained from microscopic examination of white blood cells.

The hematocrit can performed manually by filling a capillary tube with blood, centrifuging it, and measuring the percentage of the blood that consists of red blood cells. This is useful in some conditions that can cause automated hematocrit results to be incorrect, such as polycythemia (a highly elevated red blood cell count) or severe leukocytosis (a highly elevated white blood cell count, which interferes with red blood cell measurements by causing white blood cells to be counted as red cells).

Red and white blood cells and platelets can be counted using a hemocytometer, a microscope slide containing a chamber that holds a specified volume of diluted blood. The hemocytometer&#x27;s chamber is etched with a calibrated grid to aid in cell counting. The cells seen in the grid are counted and divided by the volume of blood examined, which is determined from the number of squares counted on the grid, to obtain the concentration of cells in the sample. Manual cell counts are labour-intensive and inaccurate compared to automated methods, so they are rarely used except in laboratories that do not have access to automated analyzers. To count white blood cells, the sample is diluted using a fluid containing a compound that lyses red blood cells, such as ammonium oxalate, acetic acid, or hydrochloric acid. Sometimes a stain is added to the diluent that highlights the nuclei of white blood cells, making them easier to identify. Manual platelet counts are performed in a similar manner, although some methods leave the red blood cells intact. Using a phase-contrast microscope, rather than a light microscope, can make platelets easier to identify. The manual red blood cell count is rarely performed, as it is inaccurate and other methods such as hemoglobinometry and the manual hematocrit are available for assessing red blood cells; but if it is necessary to do so, red blood cells can be counted in blood that has been diluted with saline.

Hemoglobin can be measured manually using a spectrophotometer or colorimeter. To measure hemoglobin manually, the sample is diluted using reagents that destroy red blood cells to release the hemoglobin. Other chemicals are used to convert different types of hemoglobin to one form, allowing it to be easily measured. The solution is then placed in a measuring cuvette and the absorbance is measured at a specific wavelength, which depends on the type of reagent used. A reference standard containing a known amount of hemoglobin is used to determine the relationship between the absorbance and the hemoglobin concentration, allowing the hemoglobin level of the sample to be measured.

In rural and economically disadvantaged areas, available testing is limited by access to equipment and personnel. At primary care facilities in these regions, testing may be limited to examination of red cell morphology and manual measurement of hemoglobin, while more complex techniques like manual cell counts and differentials, and sometimes automated cell counts, are performed at district laboratories. Regional and provincial hospitals and academic centres typically have access to automated analyzers. Where laboratory facilities are not available, an estimate of hemoglobin concentration can be obtained by placing a drop of blood on a standardized type of absorbent paper and comparing it to a colour scale.

===Quality control===

Automated analyzers have to be regularly calibrated. Most manufacturers provide preserved blood with defined parameters and the analyzers are adjusted if the results are outside defined thresholds. To ensure that results continue to be accurate, quality control samples, which are typically provided by the instrument manufacturer, are tested at least once per day. The samples are formulated to provide specific results, and laboratories compare their results against the known values to ensure the instrument is functioning properly. For laboratories without access to commercial quality control material, an Indian regulatory organization recommends running patient samples in duplicate and comparing the results. A moving average measurement, in which the average results for patient samples are measured at set intervals, can be used as an additional quality control technique. Assuming that the characteristics of the patient population remain roughly the same over time, the average should remain constant; large shifts in the average value can indicate instrument problems. The MCHC values are particularly useful in this regard.

In addition to analyzing internal quality control samples with known results, laboratories may receive external quality assessment samples from regulatory organizations. While the purpose of internal quality control is to ensure that analyzer results are reproducible within a given laboratory, external quality assessment verifies that results from different laboratories are consistent with each other and with the target values. The expected results for external quality assessment samples are not disclosed to the laboratory. External quality assessment programs have been widely adopted in North America and western Europe, and laboratories are often required to participate in these programs to maintain accreditation. Logistical issues may make it difficult for laboratories in under-resourced areas to implement external quality assessment schemes.

==Included tests==

The CBC measures the amounts of platelets and red and white blood cells, along with the hemoglobin and hematocrit values. Red blood cell indices—MCV, MCH and MCHC—which describe the size of red blood cells and their hemoglobin content, are reported along with the red blood cell distribution width (RDW), which measures the amount of variation in the sizes of red blood cells. A white blood cell differential, which enumerates the different types of white blood cells, may be performed, and a count of immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) is sometimes included.

===Red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit===

An example of CBC results showing a low hemoglobin, MCV, MCH and MCHC. The person was anemic. The cause could be iron deficiency or a hemoglobinopathy.

Red blood cells deliver oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and on their return carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs where it is exhaled. These functions are mediated by the cells&#x27; hemoglobin. The analyzer counts red blood cells, reporting the result in units of 106 cells per microlitre of blood (× 106/μL) or 1012 cells per litre (× 1012/L), and measures their average size, which is called the mean cell volume and expressed in femtolitres or cubic micrometres. By multiplying the mean cell volume by the red blood cell count, the hematocrit (HCT) or packed cell volume (PCV), a measurement of the percentage of blood that is made up of red blood cells, can be derived; and when the hematocrit is performed directly, the mean cell volume may be calculated from the hematocrit and red blood cell count. Hemoglobin, measured after the red blood cells are lysed, is usually reported in units of grams per litre (g/L) or grams per decilitre (g/dL). Assuming that the red blood cells are normal, there is a constant relationship between hemoglobin and hematocrit: the hematocrit percentage is approximately three times greater than the hemoglobin value in g/dL, plus or minus three. This relationship, called the &quot;rule of three&quot;, can be used to confirm that CBC results are correct.

Two other measurements are calculated from the red blood cell count, the hemoglobin concentration, and the hematocrit: the mean corpuscular hemoglobin and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. These parameters describe the hemoglobin content of each red blood cell. The MCH and MCHC can be confusing; in essence the MCH is a measure of the average amount of hemoglobin per red blood cell. The MCHC gives the average proportion of the cell that is hemoglobin. The MCH does not take into account the size of the red blood cells whereas the MCHC does. Collectively, the MCV, MCH, and MCHC are referred to as the red blood cell indices. Changes in these indices are visible on the blood smear: red blood cells that are abnormally large or small can be identified by comparison to the sizes of white blood cells, and cells with a low hemoglobin concentration appear pale. Another parameter is calculated from the initial measurements of red blood cells: the red blood cell distribution width or RDW, which reflects the degree of variation in the cells&#x27; size.

An abnormally low hemoglobin, hematocrit, or red blood cell count indicates anemia. Anemia is not a diagnosis on its own, but it points to an underlying condition affecting the person&#x27;s red blood cells. General causes of anemia include blood loss, production of defective red blood cells (ineffective erythropoeisis), decreased production of red blood cells (insufficient erythropoeisis), and increased destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia). Anemia reduces the blood&#x27;s ability to carry oxygen, causing symptoms like tiredness and shortness of breath. If the hemoglobin level falls below thresholds based on the person&#x27;s clinical condition, a blood transfusion may be necessary.

An increased number of red blood cells, leading to an increase in the hemoglobin and hematocrit, is called polycythemia. Dehydration or use of diuretics can cause a &quot;relative&quot; polycythemia by decreasing the amount of plasma compared to red cells. A true increase in the number of red blood cells, called absolute polycythemia, can occur when the body produces more red blood cells to compensate for chronically low oxygen levels in conditions like lung or heart disease, or when a person has abnormally high levels of erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates production of red blood cells. In polycythemia vera, the bone marrow produces red cells and other blood cells at an excessively high rate.

Evaluation of red blood cell indices is helpful in determining the cause of anemia. If the MCV is low, the anemia is termed microcytic, while anemia with a high MCV is called macrocytic anemia. Anemia with a low MCHC is called hypochromic anemia. If anemia is present but the red blood cell indices are normal, the anemia is considered normochromic and normocytic. The term &quot;hyperchromia&quot;, referring to a high MCHC, is generally not used. Elevation of the MCHC above the upper reference value is rare, mainly occurring in conditions such as spherocytosis, sickle cell disease and hemoglobin C disease. An elevated MCHC can also be a false result from conditions like red blood cell agglutination (which causes a false decrease in the red blood cell count, elevating the MCHC) or highly elevated amounts of lipids in the blood (which causes a false increase in the hemoglobin result).

Microcytic anemia is typically associated with iron deficiency, thalassemia, and anemia of chronic disease, while macrocytic anemia is associated with alcoholism, folate and B12 deficiency, use of some drugs, and some bone marrow diseases. Acute blood loss, hemolytic anemia, bone marrow disorders, and various chronic diseases can result in anemia with a normocytic blood picture. The MCV serves an additional purpose in laboratory quality control. It is relatively stable over time compared to other CBC parameters, so a large change in MCV may indicate that the sample was drawn from the wrong patient.

A low RDW has no clinical significance, but an elevated RDW represents increased variation in red blood cell size, a condition known as anisocytosis. Anisocytosis is common in nutritional anemias such as iron deficiency anemia and anemia due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, while people with thalassemia may have a normal RDW. Based on the CBC results, further steps can be taken to investigate anemia, such as a ferritin test to confirm the presence of iron deficiency, or hemoglobin electrophoresis to diagnose a hemoglobinopathy such as thalassemia or sickle cell disease.

===White blood cells===


The white blood cell and platelet counts are markedly increased, and anemia is present. The differential count shows basophilia and the presence of band neutrophils, immature granulocytes and blast cells.
White blood cells defend against infections and are involved in the inflammatory response. A high white blood cell count, which is called leukocytosis, often occurs in infections, inflammation, and states of physiologic stress. It can also be caused by diseases that involve abnormal production of blood cells, such as myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders. A decreased white blood cell count, termed leukopenia, can lead to an increased risk of acquiring infections, and occurs in treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy and many conditions that inhibit the production of blood cells. Sepsis is associated with both leukocytosis and leukopenia. The total white blood cell count is usually reported in cells per microlitre of blood (/μL) or 109 cells per litre (× 109/L).

In the white blood cell differential, the different types of white blood cells are identified and counted. The results are reported as a percentage and as an absolute number per unit volume. Five types of white blood cells—neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils—are typically measured. Some instruments report the number of immature granulocytes, which is a classification consisting of precursors of neutrophils; specifically, promyelocytes, myelocytes and metamyelocytes. Other cell types are reported if they are identified in the manual differential.

Differential results are useful in diagnosing and monitoring many medical conditions. For example, an elevated neutrophil count (neutrophilia) is associated with bacterial infection, inflammation, and myeloproliferative disorders, while a decreased count (neutropenia) may occur in individuals who are undergoing chemotherapy or taking certain drugs, or who have diseases affecting the bone marrow. Neutropenia can also be caused by some congenital disorders and may occur transiently after viral or bacterial infections in children. People with severe neutropenia and clinical signs of infection are treated with antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening disease.

An increased number of band neutrophils—young neutrophils that lack segmented nuclei—or immature granulocytes is termed left shift and occurs in sepsis and some blood disorders, but is normal in pregnancy. An elevated lymphocyte count (lymphocytosis) is associated with viral infection and lymphoproliferative disorders like chronic lymphocytic leukemia; elevated monocyte counts (monocytosis) are associated with chronic inflammatory states; and the eosinophil count is often increased (eosinophilia) in parasitic infections and allergic conditions. An increased number of basophils, termed basophilia, can occur in myeloproliferative disorders like chronic myeloid leukemia and polycythemia vera. The presence of some types of abnormal cells, such as blast cells or lymphocytes with features, is suggestive of a hematologic malignancy.

===Platelets===
Platelets play an essential role in clotting. When the wall of a blood vessel is damaged, platelets adhere to the exposed surface at the site of injury and plug the gap. Simultaneous activation of the coagulation cascade results in the formation of fibrin, which reinforces the platelet plug to create a stable clot. A low platelet count, known as thrombocytopenia, may cause bleeding if severe. It can occur in individuals who are undergoing treatments that suppress the bone marrow, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or taking certain drugs, such as heparin, that can induce the immune system to destroy platelets. Thrombocytopenia is a feature of many blood disorders, like acute leukemia and aplastic anemia, as well as some autoimmune diseases. If the platelet count is extremely low, a platelet transfusion may be performed. Thrombocytosis, meaning a high platelet count, may occur in states of inflammation or trauma, as well as in iron deficiency, and the platelet count may reach exceptionally high levels in people with essential thrombocythemia, a rare blood disease. The platelet count can be reported in units of cells per microlitre of blood (/μL), 103 cells per microlitre , or 109 cells per litre 

The mean platelet volume (MPV) measures the average size of platelets in femtolitres. It can aid in determining the cause of thrombocytopenia; an elevated MPV may occur when young platelets are released into the bloodstream to compensate for increased destruction of platelets, while decreased production of platelets due to dysfunction of the bone marrow can result in a low MPV. The MPV is also useful for differentiating between congenital diseases that cause thrombocytopenia. The immature platelet fraction (IPF) or reticulated platelet count is reported by some analyzers and provides information about the rate of platelet production by measuring the number of immature platelets in the blood.

===Other tests===
====Reticulocyte count====
Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells, which, unlike the mature cells, contain RNA. A reticulocyte count is sometimes performed as part of a complete blood count, usually to investigate the cause of a person&#x27;s anemia or evaluate their response to treatment. Anemia with a high reticulocyte count can indicate that the bone marrow is producing red blood cells at a higher rate to compensate for blood loss or hemolysis, while anemia with a low reticulocyte count may suggest that the person has a condition that reduces the body&#x27;s ability to produce red blood cells. When people with nutritional anemia are given nutrient supplementation, an increase in the reticulocyte count indicates that their body is responding to the treatment by producing more red blood cells. Hematology analyzers perform reticulocyte counts by staining red blood cells with a dye that binds to RNA and measuring the number of reticulocytes through light scattering or fluorescence analysis. The test can be performed manually by staining the blood with new methylene blue and counting the percentage of red blood cells containing RNA under the microscope. The reticulocyte count is expressed as an absolute number or as a percentage of red blood cells.

Some instruments measure the average amount of hemoglobin in each reticulocyte; a parameter that has been studied as an indicator of iron deficiency in people who have conditions that interfere with standard tests. The immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF) is another measurement produced by some analyzers which quantifies the maturity of reticulocytes: cells that are less mature contain more RNA and thus produce a stronger fluorescent signal. This information can be useful in diagnosing anemias and evaluating red blood cell production following anemia treatment or bone marrow transplantation.

====Nucleated red blood cells====
During their formation in bone marrow, and in the liver and spleen in fetuses, red blood cells contain a cell nucleus, which is usually absent in the mature cells that circulate in the bloodstream. Nucleated red blood cells are normal in newborn babies, but when detected in children and adults, they indicate an increased demand for red blood cells, which can be caused by bleeding, some cancers and anemia. Most analyzers can detect these cells as part of the differential cell count. High numbers of nucleated red cells can cause a falsely high white cell count, which will require adjusting.

====Other parameters====
Advanced hematology analyzers generate novel measurements of blood cells which have shown diagnostic significance in research studies but have not yet found widespread clinical use. For example, some types of analyzers produce coordinate readings indicating the size and position of each white blood cell cluster. These parameters (termed cell population data) have been studied as potential markers for blood disorders, bacterial infections and malaria. Analyzers that use myeloperoxidase staining to produce differential counts can measure white blood cells&#x27; expression of the enzyme, which is altered in various disorders. Some instruments can report the percentage of red blood cells that are hypochromic in addition to reporting the average MCHC value, or provide a count of fragmented red cells (schistocytes), which occur in some types of hemolytic anemia. Because these parameters are often specific to particular brands of analyzers, it is difficult for laboratories to interpret and compare results.

==Reference ranges==

The complete blood count is interpreted by comparing the output to reference ranges, which represent the results found in 95% of apparently healthy people. Based on a statistical normal distribution, the tested samples&#x27; ranges vary with sex and age. 

On average, adult females have lower hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count values than males; the difference lessens, but is still present, after menopause. CBC results for children and newborn babies differ from those of adults. Newborns&#x27; hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count are extremely high to compensate for low oxygen levels in the womb and the high proportion of fetal hemoglobin, which is less effective at delivering oxygen to tissues than mature forms of hemoglobin, inside their red blood cells. The MCV is also increased, and the white blood cell count is elevated with a preponderance of neutrophils. The red blood cell count and related values begin to decline shortly after birth, reaching their lowest point at about two months of age and increasing thereafter. The red blood cells of older infants and children are smaller, with a lower MCH, than those of adults. In the pediatric white blood cell differential, lymphocytes often outnumber neutrophils, while in adults neutrophils predominate.

Other differences between populations may affect the reference ranges: for example, people living at higher altitudes have higher hemoglobin, hematocrit, and RBC results, and people of African heritage have lower white blood cell counts on average. The type of analyzer used to run the CBC affects the reference ranges as well. Reference ranges are therefore established by individual laboratories based on their own patient populations and equipment.

==Limitations==
Some medical conditions or problems with the blood sample may produce inaccurate results. If the sample is visibly clotted, which can be caused by poor phlebotomy technique, it is unsuitable for testing, because the platelet count will be falsely decreased and other results may be abnormal. Samples stored at room temperature for several hours may give falsely high readings for MCV (mean corpuscular volume), because red blood cells swell as they absorb water from the plasma; and platelet and white blood cell differential results may be inaccurate in aged specimens, as the cells degrade over time.

Samples drawn from individuals with very high levels of bilirubin or lipids in their plasma (referred to as an icteric sample or a lipemic sample, respectively) may show falsely high readings for hemoglobin, because these substances change the colour and opacity of the sample, which interferes with hemoglobin measurement. This effect can be mitigated by replacing the plasma with saline.

Some individuals produce an antibody that causes their platelets to form clumps when their blood is drawn into tubes containing EDTA, the anticoagulant typically used to collect CBC samples. Platelet clumps may be counted as single platelets by automated analyzers, leading to a falsely decreased platelet count. This can be avoided by using an alternative anticoagulant such as sodium citrate or heparin.

Another antibody-mediated condition that can affect complete blood count results is red blood cell agglutination. This phenomenon causes red blood cells to clump together because of antibodies bound to the cell surface. Red blood cell aggregates are counted as single cells by the analyzer, leading to a markedly decreased red blood cell count and hematocrit, and markedly elevated MCV and MCHC (mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration). Often, these antibodies are only active at room temperature (in which case they are called cold agglutinins), and the agglutination can be reversed by heating the sample to . Samples from people with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia may exhibit red cell agglutination that does not resolve on warming.

While blast and lymphoma cells can be identified in the manual differential, microscopic examination cannot reliably determine the cells&#x27; hematopoietic lineage. This information is often necessary for diagnosing blood cancers. After abnormal cells are identified, additional techniques such as immunophenotyping by flow cytometry can be used to identify markers that provide additional information about the cells.

==History==

Before automated cell counters were introduced, complete blood count tests were performed manually: white and red blood cells and platelets were counted using microscopes. The first person to publish microscopic observations of blood cells was Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who reported on the appearance of red cells in a 1674 letter to the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society of London&quot;. Jan Swammerdam had described red blood cells some years earlier, but did not publish his findings at the time. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, improvements in microscope technology such as achromatic lenses allowed white blood cells and platelets to be counted in unstained samples.

The physiologist Karl Vierordt is credited with performing the first blood count. His technique, published in 1852, involved aspirating a carefully measured volume of blood into a capillary tube and spreading it onto a microscope slide coated with egg white. After the blood dried, he counted every cell on the slide; this process could take more than three hours to complete. The hemocytometer, introduced in 1874 by Louis-Charles Malassez, simplified the microscopic counting of blood cells. Malassez&#x27;s hemocytometer consisted of a microscope slide containing a flattened capillary tube. Diluted blood was introduced to the capillary chamber by means of a rubber tube attached to one end, and an eyepiece with a scaled grid was attached to the microscope, permitting the microscopist to count the number of cells per volume of blood. In 1877, William Gowers invented a hemocytometer with a built-in counting grid, eliminating the need to produce specially calibrated eyepieces for each microscope.

In the 1870s, Paul Ehrlich developed a staining technique using a combination of an acidic and basic dye that could distinguish different types of white blood cells and allow red blood cell morphology to be examined. Dmitri Leonidovich Romanowsky improved on this technique in the 1890s, using a mixture of eosin and aged methylene blue to produce a wide range of hues not present when either of the stains was used alone. This became the basis for Romanowsky staining, the technique still used to stain blood smears for manual review.

The first techniques for measuring hemoglobin were devised in the late 19th century, and involved visual comparisons of the colour of diluted blood against a known standard. Attempts to automate this process using spectrophotometry and colorimetry were limited by the fact that hemoglobin is present in the blood in many different forms, meaning that it could not be measured at a single wavelength. In 1920, a method to convert the different forms of hemoglobin to one stable form (cyanmethemoglobin or hemiglobincyanide) was introduced, allowing hemoglobin levels to be measured automatically. The cyanmethemoglobin method remains the reference method for hemoglobin measurement and is still used in many automated hematology analyzers.

Maxwell Wintrobe is credited with the invention of the hematocrit test. In 1929, he undertook a PhD project at the University of Tulane to determine normal ranges for red blood cell parameters, and invented a method known as the Wintrobe hematocrit. Hematocrit measurements had previously been described in the literature, but Wintrobe&#x27;s method differed in that it used a large tube that could be mass-produced to precise specifications, with a built-in scale. The fraction of red blood cells in the tube was measured after centrifugation to determine the hematocrit. The invention of a reproducible method for determining hematocrit values allowed Wintrobe to define the red blood cell indices.

Research into automated cell counting began in the early 20th century. A method developed in 1928 used the amount of light transmitted through a diluted blood sample, as measured by photometry, to estimate the red blood cell count, but this proved inaccurate for samples with abnormal red blood cells. Other unsuccessful attempts, in the 1930s and 1940s, involved photoelectric detectors attached to microscopes, which would count cells as they were scanned. In the late 1940s, Wallace H. Coulter, motivated by a need for better red blood cell counting methods following the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, attempted to improve on photoelectric cell counting techniques. His research was aided by his brother, Joseph R. Coulter, in a basement laboratory in Chicago. Their results using photoelectric methods were disappointing, and in 1948, after reading a paper relating the conductivity of blood to its red blood cell concentration, Wallace devised the Coulter principle—the theory that a cell suspended in a conductive medium generates a drop in current proportional to its size as it passes through an aperture.

That October, Wallace built a counter to demonstrate the principle. Owing to financial constraints, the aperture was made by burning a hole through a piece of cellophane from a cigarette package. Wallace filed a patent for the technique in 1949, and in 1951 applied to the Office of Naval Research to fund the development of the Coulter counter. Wallace&#x27;s patent application was granted in 1953, and after improvements to the aperture and the introduction of a mercury manometer to provide precise control over sample size, the brothers founded Coulter Electronics Inc. in 1958 to market their instruments. The Coulter counter was initially designed for counting red blood cells, but with later modifications it proved effective for counting white blood cells. Coulter counters were widely adopted by medical laboratories.

The first analyzer able to produce multiple cell counts simultaneously was the Technicon , released in 1965. It achieved this by partitioning blood samples into two channels: one for counting red and white blood cells and one for measuring hemoglobin. However, the instrument was unreliable and difficult to maintain. In 1968, the Coulter Model S analyzer was released and gained widespread use. Similarly to the Technicon instrument, it used two different reaction chambers, one of which was used for the red cell count, and one of which was used for the white blood cell count and hemoglobin determination. The Model S also determined the mean cell volume using impedance measurements, which allowed the red blood cell indices and hematocrit to be derived. Automated platelet counts were introduced in 1970 with Technicon&#x27;s Hemalog-8 instrument and were adopted by Coulter&#x27;s S Plus series analyzers in 1980.

After basic cell counting had been automated, the white blood cell differential remained a challenge. Throughout the 1970s, researchers explored two methods for automating the differential count: digital image processing and flow cytometry. Using technology developed in the 1950s and 60s to automate the reading of Pap smears, several models of image processing analyzers were produced. These instruments would scan a stained blood smear to find cell nuclei, then take a higher resolution snapshot of the cell to analyze it through densitometry. They were expensive, slow, and did little to reduce workload in the laboratory because they still required blood smears to be prepared and stained, so flow cytometry-based systems became more popular, and by 1990, no digital image analyzers were commercially available in the United States or western Europe. These techniques enjoyed a resurgence in the 2000s with the introduction of more advanced image analysis platforms using artificial neural networks.

Early flow cytometry devices shot beams of light at cells in specific wavelengths and measured the resulting absorbance, fluorescence or light scatter, collecting information about the cells&#x27; features and allowing cellular contents such as DNA to be quantified. One such instrument—the Rapid Cell Spectrophotometer, developed by Louis Kamentsky in 1965 to automate cervical cytology—could generate blood cell scattergrams using cytochemical staining techniques. Leonard Ornstein, who had helped to develop the staining system on the Rapid Cell Spectrophotometer, and his colleagues later created the first commercial flow cytometric white blood cell differential analyzer, the Hemalog D. Introduced in 1974, this analyzer used light scattering, absorbance and cell staining to identify the five normal white blood cell types in addition to &quot;large unidentified cells&quot;, a classification that usually consisted of atypical lymphocytes or blast cells. The Hemalog D could count 10,000 cells in one run, a marked improvement over the manual differential. In 1981, Technicon combined the Hemalog D with the Hemalog-8 analyzer to produce the Technicon H6000, the first combined complete blood count and differential analyzer. This analyzer was unpopular with hematology laboratories because it was labour-intensive to operate, but in the late 1980s to early 1990s similar systems were widely produced by other manufacturers such as Sysmex, Abbott, Roche and Beckman Coulter.

<text>Oxford Circus is a London Underground station in Central London, serving Oxford Circus at the junction of Regent Street and Oxford Street, with entrances on all four corners of the intersection. The station is served by three lines: Bakerloo, Central and Victoria. As of , it was the fourth-busiest station on the London Underground., and as such access to the station is frequently restricted at peak times. On the Bakerloo line the station is between Regent&#x27;s Park and Piccadilly Circus stations, on the Central line it is between Bond Street and Tottenham Court Road stations, and on the Victoria line it is between Green Park and Warren Street stations. The station is in Travelcard Zone 1.

The Central line station opened on 30 July 1900, and the Bakerloo line station on 10 March 1906. Both are Grade II listed. The station was rebuilt in 1912 to relieve congestion. Further congestion led to another reconstruction in 1923. Numerous improvements were made as part of the New Works Programme and as a flood protection measure. To accommodate additional passengers on the Victoria line, a new ticket hall was built. The Victoria line platforms opened on 7 March 1969, including cross-platform interchange with the Bakerloo line.

==History==

===Central line===

In the 1890s, the Central London Railway (CLR) published a notice of a private bill that would be presented to Parliament for the 1890 parliamentary session. The bill planned an underground route between Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Cornhill (now Bank station). These plans were accepted by both Houses of Parliament on 5 August 1891.

The CLR employed the engineers James Henry Greathead, Sir John Fowler, and Sir Benjamin Baker to design the railway. Tunnelling was completed by the end of 1898 and the official opening of the CLR (now the Central line) by the Prince of Wales took place on 27 June 1900; it was opened to the public on 30 July. Oxford Circus station opened as part of the first section of the line, between Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Bank. As part of the 1935—40 New Works Programme, the misaligned tunnels of the central section on the Central line that slowed running speeds were corrected and the platforms lengthened to accommodate longer trains.

===Bakerloo line===

In November 1891, notice was given of a private bill that would be presented to Parliament for the construction of the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&amp;WR, now the Bakerloo line). The railway was planned to run entirely underground from Marylebone to Elephant &amp; Castle via Baker Street and Waterloo. The route was approved in 1900. Construction commenced in August 1898 under the direction of Sir Benjamin Baker, W.R. Galbraith and R.F. Church. The works were carried out by Perry &amp; Company of Tregedar Works, Bow. Oxford Circus was altered below ground following a Board of Trade inspection; at the end of 1905, the first test trains began running. The official opening of the BS&amp;WR by Sir Edwin Cornwall took place on 10 March 1906. The first section of the BS&amp;WR was between Baker Street and Lambeth North, then known as &quot;Kennington Road&quot;.

===Victoria line===
A proposal for a new underground railway running from Victoria to Walthamstow was first proposed by a Working Party set up by the British Transport Commission in 1948, though that largely followed a 1946 plan for an East Croydon to Finsbury Park line. A route was approved in 1955 with future extensions to be decided later, though funding for the construction was not approved by the government until 1962. Construction began in 1962 on the initial Walthamstow to Victoria section, where cross-platform interchange was to be provided at Oxford Circus. The Victoria line platforms opened on 7 March 1969. The station opened as part of a second extension from Warren Street to Victoria. Cross-platform interchange between the Bakerloo and Victoria lines was provided by constructing the Victoria line platforms parallel to the Bakerloo ones.

===Incidents and accidents===
*On 13 February 1976, a bomb left in a case at the station by the Provisional IRA was discovered and safely defused. The station, at the height of the afternoon rush hour, was evacuated.
*On 23 November 1984, during renovation works, the station suffered a severe fire which burned out the northbound Victoria line platform. It is believed that the fire was caused by smoking materials being pushed through a ventilation grille into a storeroom where they set several materials on fire. This caused the Victoria line between Warren Street and Victoria to be suspended until 18 December the same year. Smoking had been banned on underground trains the previous July, and the fire led to the ban being extended to all subsurface stations.
*On 3 March 1997, a train derailment caused the northbound Bakerloo line service between Piccadilly Circus and Oxford Circus to be suspended for 12 days.
*On 11 August 2017, a fire occurred on a Bakerloo Line train, which was evacuated at Oxford Circus. Services were suspended between Elephant and Castle and Paddington. A number of people were treated for smoke inhalation after the fire broke out.
*On 24 November 2017, a fight between passengers on the westbound Central line platform caused a mass panic and stampede that led to 16 injuries.

===Renaming===
In 2011, Australian winemaker Oxford Landing was in talks to &#x27;rename&#x27; the station after its product, by changing the name on all signage; the deal eventually broke down due to intellectual property concerns over the London Underground logo, although TfL claimed the talks were only ever &quot;informal&quot;.

==Station building==

===Bakerloo and Central lines===
The CLR and BSWR had separate surface buildings and lift shafts. The station buildings, which remain today as exits from the station, were built on very confined plots on either side of Argyll Street on the south side of Oxford Street, just east of the circus itself. The stations as originally built were entirely separate, but connecting passages were soon provided at platform level. The surviving Central London Railway building to the east of Argyll Street is the best surviving example of stations designed by Harry Bell Measures, and the Bakerloo line building to the west is a classic Leslie Green structure. Both are Grade II listed since 20 July 2011.
Almost from the outset, overcrowding has been a constant problem, and there have been numerous improvements to the facilities and below-ground arrangements to deal with this. After much discussion between the then two separate operators, a major reconstruction began in 1912. This entailed a new ticket hall, serving both lines, being built in the basement of the Bakerloo station, with the Bakerloo lifts removed and new deep-level escalators opened down to the Bakerloo line level. Access to the CLR was by way of existing deep-level subways. The new works came into use on 9 May 1914 with the CLR lifts still available for passengers. By 1923 even this rearrangement was unable to cope, so a second rebuilding began. This involved a second set of escalators being built directly down to the Central line and the CLR station building becoming exit-only. On 2 October 1928, a third escalator leading to the Bakerloo platforms was opened. Unusually, lifts came back into prominence at an Underground station when, in 1942, a set of high-speed lifts came into use, largely used as an exit route from the Central line platforms directly to the Argyll Street exit building.

The station was closed between 31 August and 20 November 1939 to facilitate flood protection works for the preparation of The Second World War. Although street access was closed, trains still called, and interchange between the Bakerloo and Central lines was still possible within the station.

===Victoria line===
Station reconstruction to accommodate the Victoria line was described as the most time-consuming for the Victoria line project. To handle the additional Victoria line passenger loads, a new ticket hall was constructed directly under the road junction. Separate banks of escalators to each line were to be built, the existing structure to be used as exits and the lifts to be removed. A new one-way interchange subways system was to be built between the Bakerloo/Victoria lines and the Central line. To excavate the new ticket hall below the roadway, traffic was diverted for five and a half years (August 1963 to Easter 1968) onto a temporary bridge-like structure known as the &quot;umbrella&quot; covering the Regent Street/Oxford Street intersection. It consisted of 245 pieces of separate prefabricated steel work. The deck plates were placed on top of a system of steel girders which in turn rested on 25 cylindrical diameter concrete foundations, sunk from deep at night. The cylindrical piles had to clear the sites of the main and secondary roof beams of the new ticket hall and various low-level obstructions. The piles had to be built with wide footings to avoid them from collapsing. Service tunnels were constructed to carry water mains and telecom cables past the new ticket hall. The umbrella deck was extended eastwards along Oxford Street to facilitate the construction of a connecting passageway between the old and new ticket halls during the weekend of the August Bank Holiday in 1966. Construction of the Victoria line station tunnels with their platforms, the new escalator shafts and the linking passages to the Central line platforms was carried out from access shafts sunk from nearby Cavendish Square, Upper Regent Street and Argyll Street. For the construction of the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel, a special design of tunnel segment, fabricated with mild steel was adopted as there was limited space available for the construction of the platform tunnel. A pre-stressed concrete raft was constructed below the Peter Robinson&#x27;s third basement level as an extra precaution against settlement before driving the platform tunnel. The interchange passageway between the Central line and the Bakerloo line in the area of the former junction with the Bakerloo line lift landing was replaced by the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel. From there, a pilot tunnel Ventilation systems were rearranged with a new ventilation plant installed in the former Bakerloo line lift shaft. A new substation for the Bakerloo line was built at the bottom of the shaft. With the additional escalators in place, the one-way circulation scheme was introduced and the remaining lifts were removed.

==The station today==
In 2007 the station underwent a major modernisation, removing the murals installed on the Central and Bakerloo line platforms in the 1980s and replacing them with plain white tiles, in a style similar to those used when the station opened in 1900. The wall tiling on the Bakerloo line platforms featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Leslie Green. One 1980s mural remains on one of the platforms. The Central line platform works were substantially complete and a new Station Operations Room at top level opened. This enabled the entire CCTV system to be switched over to new recordable digital technology. The original motifs designed by Hans Unger on the Victoria line platforms were restored, which were originally installed in 1969. These motifs symbolise the circle of the Oxford Circus junction, with the criss-crossed lines as the Bakerloo, Central and Victoria lines.

Oxford Circus station has 14 escalators. Major escalator refurbishment took place in 2010–11. Platform humps were also installed at the station to provide level access from the platforms onto the trains. The Victoria line humps resemble in form the Harrington Hump.

===Station architecture===

On 20 July 2011, the separate station buildings were given Grade II status by the Tourism and Heritage Minister on the advice of English Heritage. Part of the reason was the consistency of the design shown by architect Leslie Green on several stations.

The station building on the northeast corner of Argyll Street and Oxford Street was designed by Harry Bell Measures. The upper storey offices designed by Delissa Joseph were later added in 1908. The building as a whole was described as a &quot;vigorous and well-detailed composition&quot; and the best preserved. This design of the station resembles the traditional design of a Central London Railway (CLR) station. The materials used are of pinkish-buff terracotta and red brick with slate roof. The detailed description of the facade is quoted below:

&quot;Wholly terracotta-clad with Mannerist detailing: pilasters flanking the entrances have capitals broken by masks and scroll brackets, supporting a cornice and frieze with moulded swags and cornucopias. Short elevation to Oxford Street contains main entrance (now exit), a broad segmental archway, originally glazed with timber mullions and now containing an openwork transom panel with diamond bracing. Large cartouche above rising into a gable, its cherub finial now lost. Long elevation to Argyll Street has two smaller segment-headed entrances, that to left cut down from an original window, and between them two similar openings containing shops. In centre, narrower doorway with glazed overlight gives access to upper floors. Curved corner section contains a metal-framed kiosk with bowed side sections bearing monograms, added before 1927 and now blocked.&quot;

Opposite the Measures&#x27;s building, the original two-storey Bakerloo line entrance was designed by Leslie Green which resembles the original architecture of the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&amp;WR) stations. It is the only station to have the original tiled signage and a cartouche bearing the Underground Electric Railways (UERL) company insignia retained. Like other original BS&amp;WR station designs, it features ox-blood red terracotta and a brick-clad steel frame. The terracotta was manufactured by Leeds Fireclay Co. Ltd. Unlike the other building, the offices above are not Grade II listed. The station name is carved with raised gilded lettering on the lower frieze to Argyll Street and Oxford Street.

<text>Nabisco (, abbreviated from the earlier name National Biscuit Company) is an American manufacturer of cookies and snacks headquartered in East Hanover, New Jersey. The company is a subsidiary of Illinois-based Mondelēz International.

Nabisco&#x27;s plant in Chicago is the largest bakery in the world, employing more than 1,200 workers and producing around of snack foods annually. Its products include Chips Ahoy!, Belvita, Oreo cookies, Ritz Crackers, Teddy Grahams, Triscuit crackers, Fig Newtons, and Wheat Thins for the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, Bolivia, Venezuela, and other parts of South America.

All Nabisco cookie or cracker products are branded Christie in Canada, after Canadian baker William Mellis Christie. Christie&#x27;s flagship bakery in Toronto was demolished after Mondelēz shut it down in 2013. Nabisco opened corporate offices as the National Biscuit Company in the Home Insurance Building in the Chicago Loop in 1898, the world&#x27;s first skyscraper.

== History ==
Pearson &amp; Sons Bakery opened in Massachusetts in 1792, and they made a biscuit called pilot bread for consumption on long sea voyages. In 1889, William H. Moore acquired Pearson &amp; Sons Bakery, Josiah Bent Bakery, and six other bakeries to start the New York Biscuit Company. Chicago lawyer Adolphus Green (1843–1917) started the American Biscuit and Manufacturing Company in 1890 after acquiring 40 different bakeries. Then Moore, Green, and John Gottlieb Zeller (1849–1939, founder of Richmond Steam Bakery) all merged in 1898 to form the &quot;National Biscuit Company&quot;, and Green was named president. Zeller was president of National Biscuit Company from 1923 to 1931.
Nabisco celebrated its golden anniversary in 1948, and &quot;Nabisco&quot; had become the corporate name by 1971. In 1981, Nabisco merged with Standard Brands to form &quot;Nabisco Brands&quot;, which merged with R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in 1985 to form RJR Nabisco. Kraft General Foods acquired the Nabisco cold cereals from RJR Nabisco in 1993, and the cereal brands are now owned by Post Holdings. In 1999, Nabisco acquired Favorite Brands International. In 2000, Philip Morris Companies Inc. acquired Nabisco and merged it with Kraft Foods in one of the largest mergers in the food industry. In 2011, Kraft Foods announced that it was splitting into a grocery company and a snack food company. Nabisco became part of the snack-food business, which took the name Mondelēz International.

The first use of the name Nabisco was in a cracker brand produced by National Biscuit Company in 1901. The firm later introduced Fig Newtons, Nabisco Wafers, Anola Wafers, Barnum&#x27;s Animal Crackers (1902), Cameos (1910), Lorna Doones (1912), Oreos (1912), and Famous Chocolate Wafers (1924, which would be discontinued in 2023).

In 1924, the National Biscuit Company introduced a snack in a sealed packet called the Peanut Sandwich Packet. They soon added the Sorbetto Sandwich Packet. These allowed salesmen to sell to soda fountains, road stands, milk bars, lunch rooms, and news stands. Sales increased, and the company started to use the name NAB in 1928. The term Nabs today is used to generically mean any type of snack crackers, most commonly in the southern US.

As of July 16, 2021, parent company Mondelēz International made the decision to close the Fair Lawn plant after 63 years forcing the majority of the 600 employees to move on and/or retire, accept jobs with other businesses or transfer within the company.

In August 2021, over 1,000 workers at several bakeries and distribution centers throughout the United States, organized under the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers&#x27; International Union, went on strike over disagreements regarding a new labor contract with Nabisco.

==Mergers and acquisitions==

===Acquisitions===

The National Biscuit Company acquired the Shredded Wheat Company, maker of Triscuit and Shredded Wheat cereal, and Christie, Brown &amp; Company of Toronto in 1928, but all of the Nabisco cookie and cracker products in Canada still use the name Christie. It also acquired F.H. Bennett Company, maker of Milk-Bone dog biscuits, in 1931.

In 1971, Nabisco bought J. B. Williams Co., a privately owned pharmaceuticals manufacturer. Williams continued to operate as a separate subsidiary. Nabisco sold Williams to Beecham Group in 1982 after nearly a decade of slumping sales.

In 1981, Nabisco merged with Standard Brands, maker of Planters Nuts, Baby Ruth and Butterfinger candy bars, Royal gelatin, Fleischmann&#x27;s and Blue Bonnet margarines, amongst others. The company was then renamed Nabisco Brands, Inc. At that time, it also acquired the Life Savers brand from the E.R. Squibb Company, makers of Bubble Yum &amp; Care-free gum. Commercials were revised as a result of the merger by January 1983.

===R. J. Reynolds merger===

In 1985, Nabisco was bought by R.J. Reynolds, forming &quot;RJR Nabisco&quot;. After three years of mixed results, the company became one of the hotspots in the 1980s leveraged buyout mania. The company was in auction with two bidders: F. Ross Johnson, the company&#x27;s president and CEO, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a private equity partnership.

The company was sold to KKR in what was then the biggest leveraged buyout in history, described in the book &quot;Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco&quot;, and a subsequent film.

===Subsequent acquisitions and divestitures===
In 1989, RJR Nabisco Inc. sold its Chun King foods division to Yeo Hiap Seng Limited and Fullerton Holdings Pte. Ltd for $52 million to reduce its debt from its $24.5 billion buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
In December 1989, RJR Nabisco sold its Del Monte canned fruits and vegetables business in South America to Polly Peck International PLC. One year later, in 1990 RJR Nabisco sold Curtiss Candy, which owned the Baby Ruth and Butterfinger brands, to Nestlé. RJR also sold LU, Belin and other European biscuit brands to Groupe Danone, only reunited in 2007 after Nabisco&#x27;s present parent, Kraft Foods, bought Danone&#x27;s biscuit operations for €5.3 billion.

In 1994, RJR sold its breakfast cereal business (primarily the Shredded Wheat franchise) to Kraft Foods Inc. and the international licenses to General Mills, which later became part of the Cereal Partners Worldwide joint venture with Nestlé.

Also in 1994, RJR acquired Rose Knox&#x27;s Knox gelatin and integrated the Shredded wheat franchise into the Post Foods portfolio. Post continues to sell the product today.

In 1995, Nestlé agreed to buy the Ortega Mexican foods business from Nabisco Inc. That same year, RJR-Nabisco also acquired the North American margarine and table spreads business of Kraft foods. This purchase included Parkay, Touch of Butter and Chiffon.
In 1998, Nabisco Holdings announced its sale of its margarine and egg substitute business to ConAgra. In 1997, the brands of Fleishmann&#x27;s, Blue Bonnet and Parkay had sales of $480 million. It also sold its College Inn broth brand to HJ Heinz and its Venezuelan Del Monte operations to Del Monte Foods.
In 1999, RJR Nabisco&#x27;s food and tobacco empire fell apart when they sold its international tobacco division to Japan Tobacco for $7.8 billion.

In 2000 Nabisco Holdings together with several investors (as Finalrealm) acquired United Biscuits, As part of the transaction, United Biscuits acquired Nabisco&#x27;s European businesses and divested Far East (China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) business to Nabisco. Nabisco became a leading shareholder in United Biscuits (the position that inherited by Kraft Foods until 2006).

The Altria Group (formerly Philip Morris) acquired Nabisco (sans Bubble Yum which was sold to Hershey) in 2000 for about $19.2 billion. Philip Morris then combined Nabisco with Kraft. That acquisition was approved by the Federal Trade Commission subject to the divestiture of products in five areas: three Jell-O and Royal brands types of products (dry-mix gelatin dessert, dry-mix pudding, no-bake desserts), intense mints (such as Altoids), and baking powder. Kraft Foods, at the time also a subsidiary of Altria, merged with Nabisco.

In 2006, Nabisco sold its Milk-Bone pet snacks to Del Monte Foods Co. for $580 million. Altria spun-off Kraft Food along with its Nabisco subsidiary in 2007. In January 2007, Kraft sold Cream of Wheat to B&amp;G Foods.

==Legal battles==
In 1997, the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus became concerned with an ad campaign for Planters Deluxe Mixed Nuts. The initial commercial featured a man and monkey deserted on an island. They discover a crate of Planters peanuts and rejoice in the peanuts&#x27; positive health facts.

Nabisco made a detailed statement describing how their peanuts were healthier than most other snack products, going as far as comparing the nutritional facts of Planters peanuts to those of potato chips, Cheddar cheese chips, and popcorn. Technically, the commercials complied with United States Food and Drug Administration regulations, and they were allowed to continue. However, as requested by the National Advertising Division, Nabisco agreed to make fat content disclosure more conspicuous in future commercials.

The company&#x27;s A1 Steak Sauce was the subject of a suit filed against Arnie Kaye in US District Court on March 13, 1990. Kaye&#x27;s delicatessen used a homemade sauce called &quot;A2 Sauce,&quot; sold in both the International Deli and Stew Leonard&#x27;s supermarkets in Westport, Connecticut. Summary judgement was rendered on March 18, 1991, by Judge Eginton who found in favor of Nabsico and ordered that they were entitled to recoup all profits from the sale of &quot;A.2.&quot; sauce as well as attorney&#x27;s fees.

== Corporate image ==

Nabisco&#x27;s trademark is a diagonal ellipse with a series of antenna-like lines protruding from the top (&quot;Orb and Cross&quot; or Globus cruciger). It forms the base of its logo and can be seen imprinted on Oreo cookies, in addition to Nabisco product boxes and literature. The trademark is derived from a medieval Venetian printer&#x27;s mark that represented &quot;the triumph of the moral and spiritual over the evil and the material&quot;. A symbol previously used to represent Christ&#x27;s redemption of the world.

The current update of the familiar Nabisco trademark was designed by American typographer and graphic designer Gerard Huerta, who has created many famous logos for corporate identity and branding as well as the movie and music industries, such as AC/DC&#x27;s.

== Sponsorship ==
From 2002 to 2005, Nabisco and Kraft jointly sponsored both Dale Earnhardt, Inc., and Roush Racing. Earnhardt Jr. won four races in a row at Daytona International Speedway with Nabisco sponsorship. Kraft and Nabisco sponsored a part-time Sprint Cup effort in car #81 driven by Jason Keller and John Andretti and fielded by Dale Earnhardt, Inc. Nabisco also sponsored Dale Earnhardt Jr. in the 2010 Subway Jalapeño 250 at Daytona International Speedway in July 2010 with their Oreo/Ritz brands and Tony Stewart with the Ritz brand in the 2010 DRIVE4COPD 300 at Daytona International Speedway in 2010.

<doc id="241579" wikidata="Q5176845" url="?curid=241579" title="Countdown (supermarket)">
<text>Countdown was an Australian-owned New Zealand full-service supermarket chain and subsidiary of Woolworths New Zealand, itself a subsidiary of Australia&#x27;s Woolworths Group. It was one of two supermarket chains in New Zealand, the other being Foodstuffs.

Until the brand&#x27;s rebranding, there were 194 Countdown stores, with 61 in Auckland.

In July 2023, the company announced that all Countdown stores would be rebranded back to Woolworths, the name of the parent company and name of the supermarket used in Australia. The rebrand came into effect from early 2024 with signage changing over the following two years.

== History ==

===Discount supermarket chain (1981–2008)===

The first Countdown Foodbarn store opened in May 1981 at the Northlands Shopping Centre in Christchurch. The store was owned by Rattrays Wholesale. The Rattrays Wholesale Group later included Rattrays Cash and Carry warehouses, tobacco vans (latter known as Red Arrow Distributors) and the SuperValue franchised supermarkets. By the end of 1981, stores had opened in Sydenham and New Brighton. 

In 1992, Foodland Associated Limited bought J. Rattray &amp; Son (which included Countdown) for $175 Million (NZD) from the Magnum Corporation. 

Foodland acquired the majority shareholding of Progressive Enterprises from Coles Myer in 1993 and shortly after sold Countdown &amp; Rattray to Progressive Enterprises. Progressive was later delisted from the New Zealand stock exchange in 1999.

During the period of 1993–2005, Countdown changed from a foodmarket type format offering mainly groceries to a &quot;full-service discount supermarket&quot;. The stores vary in size due to the consolidation of brands after the merger with Woolworths (NZ) Ltd. A number of Big Fresh, Price Chopper, and 3 Guys stores were rebranded to Countdown stores during after this merger.

FAL bought Woolworths (NZ) Ltd. from its Hong Kong-based owners Dairy Farm Group in 2002. The sale saw Progressives brands (Foodtown, Countdown, 3 Guys, SuperValue and FreshChoice) joined by Woolworths, Big Fresh and Price Chopper. With the purchase Progressives market share increased to around 45% of the NZ market.

In 2003, Progressive Enterprises closed its Auckland and Christchurch distribution centres and rehired the redundant workers. Woolworths Limited of Australia purchased Progressive Enterprises from Foodland Associated Limited on 24 November 2005.

In October 2006, Progressive Enterprises announced a discount fuel scheme with Gull Petroleum and Shell to offer discounts on petrol when shoppers spend $40 or more in their Woolworths, Foodtown or Countdown stores. This scheme was similar to the one their parent company Woolworths Limited offered in Australia. The Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission investigated whether the activity was anticompetitive. The result of which was an undertaking by the parent company to change its methods of offering fuel discounts in Australia. Foodstuffs stores in New Zealand also offered fuel discounts at BP and their own New World and Pak&#x27;nSave fuel sites.

In July 2008, Onecard, which could previously only be used at Woolworths and Foodtown, was extended to Countdown.

In October 2008, Countdown had 13 stores.

===National supermarket chain (2008–2023)===
In September 2009, Progressive Enterprises announced it would re-brand all its Foodtown and Woolworths stores to Countdown as stores were refurbished. The final Foodtown and Woolworths locations to be re-branded were Browns Bay and Meadowlands respectively, both on 14 November 2011. A single Woolworths outlet continued to operate at Mount Maunganui&#x27;s Bayfair Shopping Centre until late 2018. The store was not rebranded because a Countdown already existed at the centre. The store has now closed due to the centre expanding. Johnsonville and Upper Hutt in the Wellington region both have two Countdown stores less than apart – the result of one pre-existing Countdown store and one larger rebranded Woolworths store. A similar situation occurred in Highland Park, Auckland, where a former Foodtown was rebranded to a Countdown alongside a newer Countdown in the same shopping centre. Similar happened in Glenfield, Auckland, with two stores at either end of the same level, and in Napier, where two Countdown stores are directly across the road from each other. Also in Auckland, There are two Countdowns just across the street in Westgate.

Countdown stores existing before the initial rebranding generally retain the old style logo (although some have been updated) but the rebranded Woolworth/Foodtown stores have been updated to display the new style logo.

In February 2012, Countdown had 84 stores.

On 10 December 2012, Countdown launched its first Countdown branded in-store pharmacy. On 3 November 2014, Countdown began selling low-cost travel and life insurance through a deal with insurance giant Cigna. On 1 August 2016, Countdown began its partnership with BP and Caltex through the AA Smartfuel programme to offer fuel discounts, replacing its partnership with Z. The partnership with Gull continued until October 2016.

In 2019, a quiet-hour was introduced to the supermarkets for customers who had ear or eye sensitivities.

During the national lockdowns in response to COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand, Countdown limited the number of customers allowed inside stores at any one time.

On 10 May 2021, a stabbing attack occurred at the Countdown supermarket in central Dunedin, leaving four injured. On 3 September 2021, another stabbing attack occurred at the LynnMall Countdown in New Lynn, injuring at least six. The attacker was shot and killed by police.

In June 2023 the High Court ruled that five Countdown pharmacies were running unlawfully. Countdown was previously granted permission by the Ministry of Health to operate these pharmacies, but the court decided that these were invalid. A requirement is that 51% of a pharmacy must be owned by a pharmacist, which was not the case with these supermarkets.

=== Rebrand to Woolworths (2023) ===
In July 2023, the company announced that all Countdown stores will be rebranded back to Woolworths, the name of the parent company and name of the supermarket used in Australia. The rebrand will come into effect from early 2024 with signage changing over the next 2 years, this is part of a transformation programme that will cost a total of $400m.

Five Countdown stores started trialling security cameras at self-checkouts in August 2023. In November, Woolworths announced that they would be placing a three-and-a-half health star rating for foods placed in checkouts. This means that kid&#x27;s confectionery will be removed. It follows a similar change made in Australian Woolworths shops.

In late January 2024, a rat infestation was reported at a Woolworths New Zealand store at South Dunedin. A staff member reported the infestation to the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot; newspaper after staff had raised the matter with the store management a few months earlier in 2023. The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) launched an investigation of the store&#x27;s pest management practices. Woolworths New Zealand confirmed that it had contracted the services of several specialist pest controllers and would cooperate with MPI&#x27;s investigation. On 9 February, Countdown Dunedin South was closed after more rats were found inside the store. 

On 13 February, a mouse was spotted at another Woolworths New Zealand store at Eastgate in Christchurch. This incident prompted New Zealand Food Safety to launch an independent review of Woolworth&#x27;s national pest management processes. By 15 February, the South Dunedin store&#x27;s closure was extended until at least 19 February after a total of 24 rats were caught. Food Safety Minister Andrew Hoggard stated that people were right to expect the &quot;highest&quot; hygiene standards at supermarkets and confirmed he was monitoring the Food Safety investigation into Countdown&#x27;s pest management practices. On 16 February, Woolworths NZ issued a public apology for the pest sightings at its stores. In addition, birds were sighted at the Woolworths Grey Lynn store in Auckland. Woolworths also attracted criticism from First Union after Countdown employees in Dunedin were threatened with dismissal if they spoke to the media. The company subsequently apologised for the tone of the message. Countdown South Dunedin reopened on 28 February after 18 days, with a total of 24 rats caught.

In early February 2024 Woolworths replaced its loyalty schemes Onecard and Onecard Visa with Everyday Rewards. During the launch, customers were awarded points upon account creation, and points were able to be gifted to other people. Some customers exploited this by creating several fake accounts and gifting their main account.

==Operations==

As of September 2018, there were a total of 180 Countdown supermarkets operating throughout the North and South Islands of New Zealand.

Major store operations are handled in Woolworths NZ&#x27;s head office in Mangere, Auckland. The stores are divided in between 10 areas. Each area has an Area Manager (or Group Manager as they are sometimes called), and all areas are supported by a National Operations Manager. Previously, the areas were split into North and South regions, with 5 areas each.

Pricing and specials are divided into two regions: North Island and South Island. Internally, the North Island region is further subdivided into two sub-divisions: Upper and Lower.

Countdown also provides New Zealand wide online grocery delivery services through its online grocery shop.

&quot;New Generation&quot; Countdowns – those that have been built or refurbished since mid-2008 – have 30% of their retail floor space dedicated to fresh foods, a wider range of products than older Countdown stores (up to 30,000 items), and heating and refrigeration systems that are more energy-efficient and sustainable than older Countdown stores.

=== Logistics ===
All grocery items and general merchandise is supplied to stores through one of four distribution centres: at the head office in Auckland (National DC), one in Wiri (Upper North Island DC), in Palmerston North (Lower North Island), and in Christchurch (South Island). Deliveries are made daily to stores.

Chilled and frozen goods are supplied to stores by third party logistics operator Versacold. They operate three distribution centres in Auckland, Palmerston North and Christchurch, and deliver to stores daily.

Produce is supplied to stores by third party Freshmax. Fruit and vegetables from across New Zealand and the world are sent to the three distribution centres in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch, where they are shipped to stores daily. However, only certain stores receive a Sunday delivery.

In recent years, Countdown has moved away from having on-site butcheries and have moved to centralized facilities. Cabinet Ready Meat (CRM: pre-cut and pre-packed meat) is supplied to non-butchery stores from a central plant in Auckland. Due to the complications of logistics in shipping CRM to the South Island, all South Island Countdowns have retained their butcheries.

== Competition ==
Countdown&#x27;s main competitors are both owned by co-operative Foodstuffs – the other player in the New Zealand supermarket duopoly – in the form of full-service supermarket chain New World (with 140 stores across NZ) and lower-cost &#x27;food warehouse&#x27; Pak&#x27;nSave (57 supermarkets mainly concentrated in larger urban areas).

In terms of pricing, Countdown generally places on par with New World and above Pak n Save. In a September 2009 Consumer magazine survey, Countdown was placed third in Auckland, with a basket of 40 brand-name items costing $136, four dollars higher than New World and $21 higher than Pak&#x27;n Save.
A year earlier in September 2008, a Consumer magazine survey placed Countdown second in Auckland, with a basket of 15 private label items costing $38.24, $0.91 higher than fellow Progressive Enterprises&#x27; brand Woolworths (the Woolworths stores in question have since been rebrand as Countdown), and $1.87 lower than third-place Pak&#x27;n Save.

==Marketing and branding==

New Countdown branding was introduced on 21 September 2009. The word &quot;Countdown&quot; reused the original logo&#x27;s red colour, but with a newly adapted font-type. The previous light green background was replaced with a white one and a logo with the &quot;Shop Smarter&quot; slogan was added. The logo – representing fresh produce – is also used by Australian Woolworths outlets. As of 2018, the font used in the logo was changed to one more similar to the Australian Woolworths, and itself is dark green, but when used on stores it is white.

On stores, the slogan is missing and the word &quot;Countdown&quot; is white. The logo and name sit on a dark grey background. On newer Countdowns, however (those built after 2013) the logo and name sit on a dark green background. Some older stores still have the old branding, which is the lettering &#x27;Countdown&#x27; in red or orange on either a light or dark green background.

&quot;Shop Smarter&quot; – Countdown&#x27;s current slogan was introduced in mid-2009 to the Countdown, Woolworths and Foodtown brands. The new slogan also accompanied the introduction of &quot;The Smart Shopper&quot;, a series of 60-second twice-weekly television segment hosted by Richard Till.

=== Countdown Kids Hospital Appeal ===
From August to November every year, every Countdown store conducts fundraisers for sick children, using techniques including selling $2 wristbands and $5 raffle tickets.

=== Food donations ===
In 2011 Countdown put a formal structure in place, partnering with the Salvation Army to launch Countdown Food Rescue. This nationwide programme ensures that food that can&#x27;t be sold but is still fit for consumption is put to good use. Their stores also have trolleys where customers can place items inside of them and the contents are donated.

== Loyalty schemes ==
Countdown had two major loyalty schemes called Onecard and Onecard Visa. These were replaced with Everyday Rewards in February 2024.

===Onecard===
Countdown used a discount and rewards programme called &quot;OneCard&quot; which was introduced in July 2003 and was shared by the Woolworths and Foodtown brands. The actual Onecard is a standard magnetic stripe card that is loaded into the POS system via the EFTPOS terminal. AA Members were able to use their membership card. Countdown&#x27;s Onecard specials are the predominantly visible price on member-discounted products. The non-promotional price is displayed below.

Onecard was discontinued and replaced by Everyday Rewards effective 1 February 2024.

====Onecard Visa====
Onecard Visa was a Visa card based on Onecard. It was the same as the regular Visa cards and had additional rewards features.

===Fuel discounts===
Introduced in 2006, Countdown supermarkets began offering fuel discounts for transactions of $40 and over (as of September 2009). In August 2016 fuel discounts redeemable at BP, Caltex and Gull petrol stations replaced the former arrangement with Shell/Z.

Eight years after partnering with AA Smartfuel, Countdown discontinued its fuel discount offerings, as part of the wider discontinuation of its Onecard programme in early 2024.

== Private label brands ==
As of 2018, Countdown had seven private label brands – of which all except Signature Range and &#x27;Countdown&#x27; branded products are in common with private label brands of Woolworths Supermarkets Australia.

* Countdown Own Brand – A range of products; which are also claimed to be healthier than fully branded products.
* Free From – Grocery items for specific dietary requirements.
* Macro / Macro Free Range / Macro Organic – Grocery products from organic and free-range sources.
* Woolworths Essentials – Low-cost and &#x27;essential&#x27; items, normally with plain packaging, typically including solid colours.
*The Odd Bunch – A range of fresh produce at a lower price due to irregularities in shape or size.
*Platitude – A range of plant-based options, such as plant-based meat substitutes.
*Countdown Gold – A range of limited-edition premium products, often Christmas exclusives.

In 2016, Countdown began the process of merging their Homebrand, Select and Signature Range brands to their Woolworths Essentials and Countdown Value, Everyday, and Finest brands. The Homebrand brand was converted to Essentials and the Select and Signature range to the Countdown brand over the course of 2016, 2017 and 2018. The Free From, Macro and Gold brands were not merged.

<doc id="241582" wikidata="Q119539" url="?curid=241582" title="Andrew Pickens (governor)">
<text>Andrew Pickens Jr. (December 13, 1779June 24, 1838) was an American soldier and politician. He served as the 46th Governor of South Carolina from 1816 until 1818.

==Family==
Pickens was the son of well-known American Revolutionary general Andrew Pickens (1739–1817), and Rebecca Floride Pickens (&quot;nee&quot; Colhoun). He was born on his father&#x27;s plantation on the Savannah River in Horse Creek Valley in Edgefield County, South Carolina.

He was a maternal cousin of fellow South Carolina politician John C. Calhoun. He was also a paternal cousin of Calhoun&#x27;s wife Floride.

==Military service and legal career==
Pickens attended Brown University, graduating in 1801. He served as a lieutenant-colonel in the U.S. Army during the War of 1812. After the war, he established a plantation, &quot;Oatlands&quot;, in Edgefield County, and took up the practice of law. He also established a residence, &quot;Halcyon Grove&quot;, in the village of Edgefield, and married Susannah Smith Wilkinson.

==Political career==
On December 5, 1816, the South Carolina General Assembly elected Pickens as governor by secret ballot. Pickens championed the construction of roads and canals by government, a policy called internal improvements. During his administration, South Carolina began an internal improvements program. The price of cotton rose to the highest point reached in South Carolina during the antebellum period. The city of Charleston was struck with a disastrous yellow fever epidemic.

==Diplomacy with the Creek people==
After leaving office, Pickens moved to Alabama and helped negotiate a treaty with the Creek Indians of Georgia. For a period of time around 1829, he lived in Augusta. Growing up living by Indians, he had a very tight bond with them.

==Death==
Pickens died June 24, 1838, in Pontotoc, Mississippi, and was interred at Old Stone Church Cemetery in Clemson, South Carolina.

==Children==
His son, Francis Wilkinson Pickens (1805–1869) was a U.S. Representative and the Governor of South Carolina when the state seceded from the Union in 1860.

<doc id="241583" wikidata="Q3562660" url="?curid=241583" title="Control line">
<text>Control line (also called U-Control) is a simple and light way of controlling a flying model aircraft. The aircraft is typically connected to the operator by a pair of lines, attached to a handle, that work the elevator of the model. This allows the model to be controlled in the pitch axis. It is constrained to fly on the surface of a hemisphere by the control lines.

The control lines are usually either stranded stainless steel cable or solid metal wires of anywhere from to . Sewing thread or braided fishing line may be used instead of wires, but air resistance is greater. A third line is sometimes used to control the engine throttle, and more lines may be added to control other functions. Electrical signals sent over the wires are sometimes used in scale models to control functions such as retracting undercarriage and flaps.

There is also a control system that uses a single solid wire, this is called Monoline. When the pilot twists the wire around its axis, a spiral inside the airplane spins to move the elevator. While it can be used with some success on any type of model, it is best for speed models where the reduced aerodynamic drag of the single line is a significant advantage. The control provided is not as precise as the two-line control system.

Almost all control-line models are powered with conventional model aircraft engines of various types. It is possible to fly control-line models that do not use on-board propulsion, in a mode called &quot;whip-powered&quot;, where the pilot &quot;leading&quot; the model, whose lines are attached to a fishing or similar pole, supplying the necessary energy to keep the airplane aloft, in a fashion similar to kite-flying.

==History==
Early versions merely constrained the model to fly in a circle but offered no control. This is known as round-the-pole flying. The origins of control-line flight are obscure, but the first person to use a recognizable system that manipulated the control surfaces on the model is generally considered to be Oba St. Clair, in June 1936, near Gresham, Oregon. St. Clair&#x27;s system used a rather large apparatus similar to a television antenna, onto which many lines were attached. This system is very different from those currently in use on modern control line models. It is of interest to note that St. Clair only produced one model, the Miss Shirley, that used this system, which he called &quot;the Full House.&quot; To date, there is no evidence to show anyone else ever built a plane to use the Full House system.

The name most associated with the inventions and promotion of control line, and the inventor of the formerly patented system known as &quot;U-Control&quot; (which was a trademark, and is the system in use on virtually every two-line control line model today) was Nevilles E. &quot; Jim&quot; Walker. His &quot;American Junior&quot; company was by far the biggest producer of models and held numerous patents on the two-line system until overturned during a patent infringement suit by Walker against Leroy M Cox, based on &quot;prior art&quot; from St. Clair in the 1955 trial. One of the most coveted prizes in control-line aerobatics competition sanctioned by the AMA, awarded to the winner of a flyoff between the US Junior, Senior, and Open age class Champions, was originally provided by and is named for Walker. This is one of the oldest perpetual trophies in modeling that is still awarded.

==The airframe==
Control-line models are built of the same basic materials and construction methods as R/C and free flight models. Control-line model construction varies with the category of model. Aerobatics and combat models are relatively lightly built compare to R/C models as they need high maneuverability in the limited space offered by the control line hemisphere. They are typically built with traditional materials like balsa wood, plywood, paper, plastic, spruce, and polystyrene foam, but modern composite and graphite/epoxy are occasionally used in high-load applications. Combat models must also be relatively easy and quick to build, as mid-air collisions and crashes are common.

Aerobatic model construction is typically quite complex and may require many hundreds of hours. Speed models must be very sturdy to withstand the forces of line tension and to permit a very rigid engine mount for maximum engine performance. Speed models are generally built around an aluminum or magnesium &quot;pan&quot; that forms about half the fuselage. Little or no maneuverability required, as once at speed the model&#x27;s altitude is maintained by centripetal Acceleration. Racing models need to be both relatively light for good acceleration from the start, or after a pit stop, and to reduce the pitch of the airfoil required to maintain lift. Race Aircraft also be fairly strong to withstand the pit man catching the model after landing.

To control the airplane, the lines must remain in tension. Centripetal Acceleration is generally sufficient to maintain line tension if the airplane is properly &quot;trimmed&quot; (adjusted), but sometimes additional features such as rudder offset and engine offset are added to provide extra tension. It is of interest to note, that when a control line model does a loop, it no longer flies on the edge of a hemisphere, but traverses the edge of a cone, a planar path, and the motion of the model produces no centripetal acceleration. In the condition of flying a loop, other factors must therefore provide the line tension, such as engine offset, or lead-out rake. Weight in the outboard wing tip is usually used to balance the weight of the lines. Top aerobatics models typically have a large number of adjustable features like tip weight boxes, adjustable rudder offset, adjustable line sweep, and adjustable elevator and flap controls. Some aerobatics models use a variable rudder system (commonly called the Rabe rudder after its inventor, Al Rabe) to vary the rudder offset during flight. The adjustment of the various adjustable features on a modern stunt model can become quite complex.
Many models also feature a longer inboard wing; aerobatics models use this to balance the lift from side-to-side, compensating for the difference in velocity from inboard to outboard wing, while some speed models use only an inboard wing, which eliminates the drag of the outboard wing completely (these models are colloquially referred to as &quot;Sidewinders&quot;). In general 2/3rds of the aerodynamic drag of the entire control line model systems (Plane, Lead-Outs, Lines/Connectors, Handle) is created by the lines/connectors.

In general there are two types of fuselage construction that are used in control line: &quot;profile&quot; (flat) and &quot;built up&quot;. These are built with differing types of wings depending on the specific use of the aircraft. Profile models, where the fuselage is cut out from a single relatively thin sheet of wood with the &quot;profile&quot; of the airplane, are simple to build and repair, and are very common on trainer models. Sometimes the vibration of the engine causes poor engine runs on profile models. Built-up fuselages are much more difficult to build but generally look better and offer superior engine runs.

==Controls==
The aircraft is typically controlled by a set of 20–70-foot lines usually of multi strand stainless steel, single strands of piano wire, or G.S.U.M.P. (Gel Spun Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene, made by DuPont). For sport flying, non-metallic lines of kevlar, dacron, or other low-stretch fiber materials are commonly used. This type of control was originally trademarked as &quot;U-Control&quot; and is by far the most common control method.

The controls of a conventional 2-line/&quot;U-Control&quot; system consist of lead-out cables, a bellcrank, push rods and control horns. These are connected so that differential motion of the lines rotates the bellcrank, causing a pushrod to move either forward or aft. The pushrod is connected to the control surface with a control horn that moves the elevator (and flaps, if used) up and down. The pilot holds a handle to which the lines are attached. Tilting the handle with the fingers, wrist, and/or elbow motion causes the differential movement in the lines. By convention, tilting the hand so the top is closer to the pilot than the bottom results in &quot;up&quot; elevator, much like pulling back on a full-scale airplane control stick. Also by convention, most airplanes are flown nominally counter-clockwise as viewed from above, with the leadout cables exiting the left wing. This is not universal and some pilots fly in the opposite direction. Flying clockwise has a slight advantage in some situations because most engines run so that the torque will roll the airplane away from the pilot, increasing line tension in upright level flight.

The controls can be expanded by adding a third line that controls the throttle. The most common system for throttle control is that devised by J. Robert Smurthwait, of Baker Oregon, and is widely available. The throttle is usually a conventional carburetor as used on radio control models schemes that couple limited rudder and/or aileron, and variable leadout position are often found on carrier planes as well as elevator and flaps/
Monoline control works by twisting the single line. The pilot holds a handle with a twisted flat piece of metal on bearings in one hand, and a &quot;bobbin&quot; in the other. Moving bobbin towards or away from the handle twists the line. Inside the airplane, the rotating line rotates a spiral scroll with a follower. The follower moves toward and away from the pivot of the scroll, and has a pushrod attached. Then, as the scroll rotates, the pushrod moves fore and aft. The rest of the system is like the two-line system. The control of a monoline system is much less precise than a two-line system because the line itself tends to twist up before it moves the scroll, leading to a somewhat vague control response with considerable lag. It does however have the advantage of not requiring as much line tension to move the controls, and the single line has less drag than the two slightly smaller lines used in conventional two-line control.

Other control methods were devised early on to avoid having to pay royalties on the &quot;U-Control&quot; patent, including systems with the lines connected directly to the elevator with pulleys to change the pitch, methods that connected the lines directly to the pushrod through screw eyes, but most worked very poorly compared to conventional 2-line control.

==Power==
Control-Line airplanes usually have a power plant of to , although engines can be as large as .90, or may have electric power. Two-stroke glow engines are most common, but almost any form of model engine has been used, including pulse jet engines and turbojets. Control-line models tend to have very high power-to-weight ratios compared to R/C models or full-scale aircraft. The size of the engines and the models are significantly limited by the maximum line length of used for competition, although very long lines (as much as 150 feet) have been used on rare occasions.

The competition categories that need high power output and speed can turn at very high rotational speeds for a reciprocating engine. A engine used in the FAI Speed event may produce as much as at rotational speeds in the range of 45000 rpm - faster than some full-scale turbojets. The specific output is around 1200 hp/liter which is far in excess of racing motorcycle engines or Formula 1 auto racing engines. Many breakthroughs in two-stroke engine design (both model and motorcycle) can be traced back to C/L speed models, as the small size makes it easy to experiment with new designs at low cost.

Control line models tend to run a varying mix of fuel however 10% nitromethane, 20% castor oil and 70% methanol is common. Castor oil is sometimes replaced by synthetics, however as control line aircraft typically run at high throttle settings for the entire flight, castor oil generally provides better lubrication and cooling and is thus considered safer for the engine. It is however somewhat viscous and the resulting oil drag can rob some power compared to synthetic oil, and can also lead to &quot;varnishing&quot; of the cylinder. Some older-technology engines commonly used for control line can be very quickly damaged with typical R/C fuels because of low oil content.

Pulse jet models use gasoline, a variety of flammable liquids like acetone, methyl-ethyl-ketone, and other similar fluids. Pulse-jet models are started by applying a continuous spark device (e.g. a &quot;buzzer coil&quot; as used on a Fordson tractor) to a spark plug in the side of the combustion chamber, and then using a bicycle pump or pressurized air to blow air across the fuel injector and into the engine. When a flammable mixture is present in the engine, it will detonate, sending a shock wave down the tail pipe and creating suction at the intake end of the engine, sucking in more fuel/air, and creates another explosion. Once started, the engine becomes hot very quickly and no longer requires the spark. The spark box and air source are disconnected and then model launched as quickly as possible to prevent the heat generated by the engine from causing the airplane to catch fire. The engine is extremely loud in operation and cannot be muffled, and can be heard for miles under the right conditions.

The propellers used for control-line models are commonly made of wood (usually maple), fiberglass-reinforced plastic (GRP), or graphite/kevlar/fiberglass and epoxy. The propeller pitch and diameter are chosen based on the engine size, type of performance desired, and cost. A typical .61-sized piped engine uses a 3-bladed propeller around 12-13&quot; in diameter and around 4&quot; of pitch, and is usually made of graphite/epoxy. A .20-sized sport model might use an inexpensive 8&quot; diameter, 4&quot; pitch propeller made of fiberglass-reinforced plastic. The graphite stunt propellers are usually made in small production runs or even by hand, and can cost as much as $50. Small GRP sport propellers are made by injection molding and may cost as little as $2.

The fuel for the engine is usually held in a metal or plastic fuel tank, shaped so that fuel is drawn from the outside edge of the tank, as the fuel tends to be thrown to the side by centrifugal force as the airplane travels in a circle. A &quot;clunk tank&quot; as used in R/C is satisfactory, but dedicated tanks with wedge-shaped cross-sections are frequently used and tend to have better characteristics as the fuel runs out. A tank with a vent on the inner edge, or multiple vents, is usually called a &#x27;suction&#x27; tank. The pressure of fuel delivery with a suction tank changes as the fuel runs out, causing the engine mixture ratio to become leaner as the flight proceeds. Tanks vented to only permit air to enter at the outside edge (&quot;uniflow&quot; tanks) provide constant fuel pressure over the duration of the flight and a constant mixture ratio.

Combat and some speed models use rubber tubing (&quot;bladder&quot; tank), baby pacifiers, or fountain pen ink bladders, inflated with fuel from a large syringe, to hold the fuel under fairly high pressure. The fuel line is pinched off to prevent fuel loss until the engine is started. The high pressure of fuel delivery permits the use of a larger intake on the engine, allowing more air flow than would otherwise be possible, and thus more power. This type of fuel delivery is by far the most steady until the fuel finally runs out.

The carburetion on most control-line engines is a simple fixed-size orifice (venturi) with only a mixture ratio adjustment. The engine can be run over a very wide range of mixtures and adjusting the needle valve can be used to adjust the engine speed over a small range. Once released, the engine runs at a more-or-less constant speed until the fuel runs out, or, if equipped, the fuel-shutoff is activated. Altering the size of the venturi used can be used to adjust the gross power. Two-stroke glow motors can be made to run in a 4-stroke mode where the engine mis-fires on every other stroke, and changes mode of firing based on load of the propeller. A tremendous degree of control over how the engine runs in flight is possible by altering the fuel contents, propeller size, pitch, and pitch distribution, venturi size, compression ratio of the engine, and the length of the tuned exhaust, if used.

==Landing gear==
The landing gear/undercarriage on control line aircraft can vary from basic piano wire and wheels to competition models with spring-loaded shock absorption and wheel pants. Retractable landing gear is common on scale models and is occasionally used in stunt. Most speed and combat models omit the landing gear in the interest of drag and weight reduction, and are launched from hand or a &quot;dolly&quot;.

Navy carrier models have a reinforced hook to help them catch an arresting cable on a simulated carrier deck.

==Competitions==
Competitions for control line aircraft are held in various classes. These include speed, precision aerobatics (AKA stunt), team racing, combat, naval carrier, and scale.

For competition the lines are tested before flight with a &quot;pull test&quot; that varies with the model weight and category to verify that the lines and control system (primarily the bellcrank and its attachment to the rest of the model) will withstand the line tension during flight.

===Speed (F2A)===

Speed is divided up into different engine capacity classes and a Jet class (using pulse jet engines). As the name suggests, the idea is to have the model go as fast as possible. The model is timed over a number of laps, and the pilot must hold the handle controlling his model in a yoke on top of a pole in the center of the circle. This is in order to stop the pilot from assisting the model to go faster by increasing the line tension and leading the model (known as whipping). Monoline control systems are common in the US, but international classes require the use of two-line control. Speeds of the fastest models - Class D and Jet - have in the past exceeded . Current US rules limit the speeds to &lt; by requiring the use of larger lines if is exceeded. Speed models are usually launched from a &quot;dolly&quot; - a cart that permits a lengthy ground roll for takeoff, but drops away in the air to reduce drag. The airplane lands on a skid or belly pan.

===Precision aerobatics (F2B)===
Precision aerobatics consists of flying a fixed sequence of maneuvers which are judged by a panel of judges for accuracy and precision. The event was originally dubbed &quot;stunt&quot; and current participants refer to it that way informally. Factors such as height of the maneuver bottoms, shapes, corner radius, and other factors are considered. The judges at large competitions are typically trained for several days on how to assess the maneuvers and apply a score. Judging well is generally considered at least as difficult as flying in competition.

Stunt models tend to be among the larger control line models, wings usually spanning from around . Top competition models have been traditionally powered by a two-stroke engine in the to range, with four-stroke model engines and electric power also becoming popular as power sources. The airplanes, while possessing high thrust-to-weight ratios by full-scale standards (usually at least 1:1), are intended to fly quite slowly to enhance pilot control, typically around , with a single lap of the circle taking around 5.5 seconds.

Engines are commonly set to increase their power output when under load. This permits low speeds but very good speed stability, so the climb performance is excellent. The original scheme used was to take advantage of the tendency of a nominally two-stroke glow engine to change from running in a four-stroke when set with extremely rich mixtures, to running in a two-stroke when the load increases. This is called a &quot;4-2 break&quot;. More recently, tuned exhausts have been used to provide regulation of the speed in flight. Combined with propellers of relatively low pitch, this has permitted much more control over the engine&#x27;s speed and power response to maneuvering. Electric system contain feedback control system that govern the RPM of the motor to a constant value regardless of load.

Most competitive aircraft are fitted with flaps on the wings, which work in conjunction with the elevator to increase the pitch maneuverability. When up-elevator is applied, the flaps on the wings go down, and vice versa. This results in the wing, which is otherwise of a symmetrical section, to be cambered in the direction needed to enhance maneuvering. Aircraft without flaps can be flown successfully and are typically simpler, but flapped models typically fly more smoothly and can be heavier. Some of the simpler stunt models make excellent control-line trainers, as the predictable control response, low speed, and strong line tension make them easy to fly successfully.
Stunt models are often beautifully painted. Stunt rules include the appearance of the model in the score, and creating the most perfectly finished and attractive models is a competition in and of itself. A &quot;Concours d&#x27;Elegance&quot; award is voted on by the pilots at the Academy of Model Aeronautics&#x27; US Nationals in Muncie, Indiana for the prettiest airplane, and is very highly prized.

Stunt is flown in many countries, with World Championships being held on alternate years. These are open for any flier who makes his or her respective national team. Competition at the highest levels (National or World Championships) can take many years or decades of practice to master the intricacies of designing, building, finishing, adjusting, and controlling the power of the airplanes, in addition to the high piloting skills. Many top competitive pilots have coaches.

Many competitions separate pilots into 4 different skill levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced and expert) allowing pilots to compete against other pilots of similar skill levels.

===&quot;Old time&quot; stunt===

Much like the &quot;old timer&quot; vintage design movement in free flight aeromodeling, several specialized classes of Stunt include &quot;Old Time Stunt&quot; where simpler maneuvers are performed with a model that was designed before a specific date (Pre 1953 per US rules) and &quot;Classic&quot; stunt which uses the current stunt &quot;pattern&quot; of maneuvers and airplanes designed prior to 1970.

===Racing (F2C)===

Racing is an event for two-person teams—the pilot and the pit crew. There are various racing classes of various levels of difficulty: F2C (the class flown internationally and at World Championships), Goodyear (semi-scale models of &#x27;Goodyear era&#x27; full-size racers), Vintage classes and so on.

The basic idea of all the events is that a number of models (up to three) fly together, aiming to complete a given number of laps before any of the others. The model is also required to make multiple pit stops during the race, where it is refueled, the engine restarted, and the model re-launched. This is the job of the pit crew. There are rules describing how the pilots must walk around each other, and how to pass (harder than one might think, as each model is on the end of a pair of control lines and travelling as fast as 140 mph). Pit stops require that the model be refueled and restarted - which can be a problem with a very hot racing engines. The best FAI Team Race pit stops take around 2–3 seconds for the pilot to cut the motor and land, allowing the pit-man to catch the model which only moments ago was flying at , fill the tank with 7cc of model fuel from a pressurized tank, adjust the engine mixture and compression if needed, restart, and relaunch the model.

===Combat (F2D)===
Combat is an event where two pilots &quot;dogfight&quot; for cuts on their opponent&#x27;s streamer, for a perscribed amount of time called the &quot;Match&quot;. Models are fast and highly maneuverable typically of flying-wing types, which chase each other around the sky at speeds in excess of . Despite deliberate mid-airs being banned, the carnage rate is high, and pilots commonly bring 10 or more models to a competition.

In the US there are three A.M.A. Events, which are Fast Combat (up to a .36 c.i.d. engine is allowed), Speed Limit Combat and 1/2A (up to a .051 c.i.d. engine is allowed) Combat which can be flown high or low performance. In any event where the model exceeds 75 mph, the model must be equipped with a fuel shut-off, which shuts the engine off, when the control lines are cut. Combat may be held as a kill event, or a no-kill event. A kill is scored when one competitor cuts the string that holds the streamer (of his opponent), to the plane, and is an instant win of the match. Cutting the streamer however results in an award of points. In No-Kill combat cutting the string is the same as cutting the streamer and only points are awarded. There are a lot of unofficial events held throughout the US, such as Northwest 80 mph Combat, WWII combat, Formula GX Combat, 15 Fast and the like. Combat requires perhaps the fastest reflexes of any CL event, and pilots skilled at combat typically compete well in other events like Stunt or Racing. Combat has been described as a team sport, with the pilot relying on up to a two-person pit crew. As may be imagined, with two pilots not cooperating with each other, line tangles can happen suddenly, and crash landings are common. Despite the high speed of the models, most combat models are made to be quite robust, and when time allows may hit the ground and suffer little damage and be relaunched. Although for the Speed limit events up to a .40 c.i.d. engine may be used, for the AMA fast event, there is only one manufacture of a high performance .36, that being Henry Nelson. A well-tuned and fueled Nelson 36 may achieve 25,000 r.p.m. while statically running on the ground and gain significant r.p.m. in the air. Current 1/2A engines in use are all from former soviet republics and include the Fora and Cyclon, both of which will run well above 33,000 r.p.m. In all the AMA events pressure fed fuel systems are allowed and virtually every combat plane is equipped with a fuel &quot;Bladder&quot;. The Fuel Bladder gives the most consistent fuel feed while the aircraft is undergoing sudden and violent maneuvers, typical of flying in a match.

F2D combat - the international class for combat - is most popular in Russia and Europe, where some countries have professional or semi-professional teams. Russia and the former Soviet countries are currently the main producers of world-class equipment for this sport, including engines. Their combination of the latest engineering and design, with exotic metallurgy and experience, results in combat engines which reliably turn 32,000 rpm, and can be restarted easily in the event of a crash. Requiring lightning-fast reflexes, combat has frequently been used as a training-ground and/or hobby for many commercial and military pilots .

===Navy carrier===

Navy carrier is an event where semi-scale models of real naval aircraft are flown. The event replicates the requirements of full-scale carrier aircraft, which need high speed for combat performance, and low speeds and toughness for safe carrier landings. Takeoff and landing are from a simulated aircraft carrier deck, with arrestor wires.

The aim of the flight is to complete a number of fast laps, flown as quickly as possible, followed by a number of slow laps, flown as slowly as possible. This is followed by the carrier deck landing, attempting to snag the arrestor wire. The score depends on the difference of the high and low speed, and the arrested landing. Carrier models usually have a third control line, worked by a finger trigger in the handle. This line allows the throttle setting of the engine to be controlled and the arrestor hook to be dropped. Often, a carrier model will have flaps. Unlike a stunt model, however these flaps are worked separately from the elevator. A large amount of flap is usually applied during the slow laps, and a large amount of line sweep is added to yaw the model out of the circle to maintain line tension at the very low ground speeds. Low speeds are frequently no faster than a fast walk, and when aimed into a light breeze forward motion may stop completely with the model hanging at a very high angle of attack from the propeller.

===Scale===
Scale is an event where an accurate scale model of a real aircraft is flown. Scoring is based on static judging of how closely the aircraft resembles the full-size prototype and on the flight performance. Extra points are often awarded for &quot;working&quot; features of the model, such as a retractable landing gear, droppable bombs, and other functions or operations. The number of features used to be limited by the number of lines that could be practically used to mechanically control them.

Some complex scale models use a fly-by-wire approach to allow a multitude of extra working features. A radio-control transmitter&#x27;s encoder unit can be adapted, with no RF signal board present, to send its control signals along insulated control lines, instead of broadcasting them using radio frequencies. If signals are sent down the lines, the normal serial multiplexing of the control signals by such an adapted RC transmitter&#x27;s encoder unit, solely sending those signals along the usual duo or trio of control lines, gets picked up by decoding gear in the model - usually adapted from an RC receiver, without an RF &quot;front end&quot; section - and permits many functions to be controlled without the use of additional lines. Standard servos can then be used in the model. From 2013, in the USA, the radio control &quot;over the airwaves&quot; of any moveable feature of control-line Scale or Carrier models (except the elevator) is permitted - this may spread to Europe and beyond in time.

==Safety==
Control-line flying is generally quite safe when all prescribed safety measures are followed. The airplane is constrained to fly in a circle, which is generally marked. A pilots&#x27; circle is also provided, so as long as the pilot stays in the pilot&#x27;s circle and everyone else is outside the outer circle, the flying model can hit no one. In most competition categories, a &quot;safety thong&quot; connecting the control handle to the pilot&#x27;s wrist is also required, so if the pilot inadvertently releases the handle, the airplane cannot fly outside the circle (and, frequently crashes, safely for others if not the airplane, when control is lost). The lines, handle, and control system are subjected to a &quot;pull test&quot; before flight to ensure that they are in good shape with some significant margin. For example, the pull test is around for a Stunt model (a 10G load), and the in-flight pull is around . This provides a 2x margin of safety even if one line should fail. One failed line immediately moves the elevator to the extreme of its movement, which almost always results in a crash, safely in the circle. Other categories of model are tested in a similar way, with the loads set to correspond to the expected speeds with a safety margin around a factor of 4.

Combat models, albeit very rarely, may have their lines cut or otherwise broken by the other airplane, and can fly outside the circle. Most combat competition today requires that the airplane be equipped with a device that shuts off fuel to the engine if the lines are cut. This can work by either using the centripetal acceleration to keep the shutoff from pinching the line, or by using the line tension to hold the pinch-off device open. This way, the engine is not running and tends to decelerate very quickly instead of accelerating quickly as it would otherwise (since the drag of the lines is removed). This technique has proved to be very effective in practice. Many combat events also require the engine to be attached to the bellcrank with a cable, so that a mid-air collision will not result in the engine flying off and into the spectators. Competitors in some forms of combat competition are also required to wear helmets.

Another potential safety issue is overhead power lines. Contact with power lines, or approaching high-tension power lines, is potentially fatal and must be avoided. The use of non-metallic lines may reduce the risk of electrocution, but still a margin of 150 from the plane to power lines, is mandated in the AMA safety code.

Sometimes models with landing gear are flown by using a &quot;stooge&quot; that holds the airplane until released by the pilot from the center, usually with a spring-loaded pin pulled with a string. This allows a pilot to practice with no helper, and is common with stunt fliers trying to practice extensively. This has the potential to be dangerous if the pilot fails to properly reset the stooge, the wire connecting the stooge to the airplane (usually attached to the tail wheel) breaks, the stooge moves under the thrust/vibration of the engines, or the pilot&#x27;s feet get tangled in the stooge release line.

The other safety issues are common with other powered model categories. Hand-starting very powerful engines, with very sharp propellers, can be quite hazardous. An electric starter can be used, but can have negative effects on the engines due to engines not being designed to take that kind of force pushing the crank shaft back. One such method is the &quot;back-bump&quot; method, where the engine is choked and flipped through with no battery attached to create favorable starting conditions. Once prepared, all that is necessary is to rock the engine backwards so that it coasts up to compression, and if done correctly, starts forwards. This provides time to move the hand out of the way and the fingers are not in contact with the propeller or spinner when the engine starts. Care must be taken even choking the engine as modern engines with their accurate piston/cylinder fit can &quot;bump&quot; or even start without the battery attached. Once the propeller is rotating, extreme care must be taken when preparing for flight and adjusting the engine. A starting accident frequently results in a small cut to the finger, but once the engine is at full speed any injury that is encountered is likely to be quite severe.

Pulse jet engines get extremely hot once started, and use very volatile fuels like gasoline or methyl-ethyl-ketone (as contrasted to relatively benign, although flammable, glow engine fuel). Contact of any type with the tailpipe of the engine is certain to result in severe burns, as the engine reaches red-hot temperatures in seconds. The airplane itself needs some sort of insulation to prevent catching fire on the ground before forward motion provides cooling air, and fully enclosed engines can set the airplane on fire after landing. The airplane should be launched as soon as possible after the engine starts to prevent heat buildup. The spark unit used for starting can also deliver a substantial electrical shock. A fire extinguisher should be at hand at all times when operating the engine. The engine is exceptionally loud when operating and should be operated with hearing protection to prevent damage.

<doc id="241584" wikidata="Q868994" url="?curid=241584" title="Clinton National Airport">
<text>Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport , also known as Adams Field, is a joint civil-military airport on the east side of Little Rock, Arkansas, United States. It is operated by the Little Rock Municipal Airport Commission.

The largest commercial airport in Arkansas, it served more than 2.1 million passengers in the year spanning from March 2009 through to February 2010. While Clinton National Airport does not have direct international passenger flights, more than 50 flights arrive or depart at Little Rock each day, with nonstop service to 14 cities. The airport is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2019–2023, in which it is categorized as a small-hub primary commercial service facility.

==History==

The airport was originally named Adams Field after Captain George Geyer Adams, 154th Observation Squadron, Arkansas National Guard, who was killed in the line of duty on September 4, 1937. He was a strong advocate for the airport, and also a Little Rock city councilor.

American Airlines was the first airline to serve Little Rock when it first landed at Adams Field on June 19, 1931.

During World War II the airfield was used by the United States Army Air Forces Third Air Force for antisubmarine patrols and training.

In 1972 the airport opened its current 12-gate terminal.

In August 2008, the airport approved a plan to renovate the terminal over a 15-year period. This would expand the terminal from 12 to 16 gates.

On March 20, 2012, the municipal airport commission voted to rename the airport the Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport, named after Arkansas native, former Governor and United States President Bill Clinton and his wife, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The name Adams Field will continue to be used when referring to the airport&#x27;s runways and air traffic, and will be the airport&#x27;s official designator. In 2017, Republican state Sen. Jason Rapert filed a bill that would have forced the airport to be renamed but relented when he found little support for the measure.

In October 2013, &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; released a survey of travelers that ranked Clinton National Airport as the worst of the 67 domestic airports considered in the survey. The survey report cited long lines and few food and shopping choices, among other criticisms. A survey commissioned by the airport contradicted &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot;″s claim, finding that more than 90% of passengers were satisfied with their experience.

In March 2024, the Clinton National Airport&#x27;s executive director Bryan Malinowski was killed in a shootout with Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agents attempting to conduct a pre-dawn raid on his home. An affidavit accused him of illegal gun sales.

==Facilities and aircraft==
Clinton National Airport covers 2,000 acres (809 ha) at an elevation of 266 feet (81 m) above mean sea level. It has three concrete runways: 4L/22R is 8,273 by 150 feet (2,522 x 46 m); 4R/22L is 8,251 by 150 feet (2,515 x 46 m); 18/36 is 6,224 by 150 feet (1,897 x 46 m). It has one concrete helipad 50 by 50 feet (15 x 15 m).

In the year ending February 28, 2023, the airport had 83,217 aircraft operations, an average of 228 per day: 47% general aviation, 26% scheduled commercial, 16% air taxi, and 10% military. The military operations are mostly C-130 transports from nearby Little Rock Air Force Base practicing touch-and-go landings. At that time, 122 aircraft were based at this airport: 42 single-engine, 22 multi-engine, 54 jet, and 4 helicopter.

There are two fixed-base operators (FBOs) on the field: Signature Flight Support and Atlantic Aviation. Central Flying Service, under new ownership, operates on the field offering aircraft maintenance, sales and flight training.

Dassault Aircraft Services (DAS), a subsidiary of Dassault Aviation, operates a large facility at the airport. It is the site of two Falcon aircraft operations: the main Completion Center for all Falcon jets worldwide, and the company-owned Service Center.

Current production model Falcons are manufactured in France, then flown in &quot;green&quot; condition to the Completion Center where optional avionics and custom interiors are installed, and exteriors are painted. Dassault Aircraft Services (DAS) – Little Rock provides inspection, maintenance, modification, completion and repair needs for the Falcon product line.

The Dassault Aircraft Services (DAS) – Little Rock Service Center and Completion Center employs nearly 1,600 people and has a combined occupance of nearly , making Little Rock the largest Dassault facility in the world.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On January 19, 1990, an Eastman Kodak Grumman Gulfstream II crashed during final approach to Little Rock National Airport; all seven on board were killed. Unfavorable weather conditions and pilot error contributed to the accident.
* On June 1, 1999, American Airlines Flight 1420, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82 with 145 passengers and crew, attempting to land in a severe thunderstorm, overran the end of runway 4R, crashed through a fence and down a rock embankment into a flood plain; killing 10 passengers and the captain.
* On February 22, 2023, a Beechcraft Super King Air took off during gusty winds and heavy rain. Shortly after takeoff, the plane crashed near a 3M plant, killing all five on board. The passengers were members of an environmental firm called CTEH en route to investigate an explosion at a metal factory in Bedford, Ohio.
*On January 21, 2024, a Cirrus SR22 took off from runway 4L and crashed north of the cargo building near Temple Street. The pilot, 62-year-old William Cope, reported a loss of power at take-off and crashed shortly after, at approximately 1:30 PM. He was the only person on board and subsequently died in the crash.

<text>In economics and marketing, product differentiation (or simply differentiation) is the process of distinguishing a product or service from others to make it more attractive to a particular target market. This involves differentiating it from competitors&#x27; products as well as from a firm&#x27;s other products. The concept was proposed by Edward Chamberlin in his 1933 book, &quot;The Theory of Monopolistic Competition&quot;.

==Rationale==

Firms have different resource endowments that enable them to construct specific competitive advantages over competitors. Resource endowments allow firms to be different, which reduces competition and makes it possible to reach new segments of the market. Thus, differentiation is the process of distinguishing the differences of a product or offering from others, to make it more attractive to a particular target market.

Although research in a niche market may result in changing a product in order to improve differentiation, the changes themselves are not differentiation. Marketing or product differentiation is the process of describing the differences between products or services, or the resulting list of differences. This is done in order to demonstrate the unique aspects of a firm&#x27;s product and create a sense of value. Marketing textbooks are firm on the point that any differentiation must be valued by buyers (a differentiation attempt that is not perceived does not count). The term unique selling proposition refers to advertising to communicate a product&#x27;s differentiation.

In economics, successful product differentiation leads to competitive advantage and is inconsistent with the conditions for perfect competition, which include the requirement that the products of competing firms should be perfect substitutes. There are three types of product differentiation:

# Simple: based on a variety of characteristics
# Horizontal: based on a single characteristic but consumers are not clear on quality
# Vertical: based on a single characteristic and consumers are clear on its quality

The brand differences are mostly minor; they can be merely a difference in packaging or an advertising theme. The physical product need not change, but it may. Differentiation is due to buyers perceiving a difference; hence, causes of differentiation may be functional aspects of the product or service, how it is distributed and marketed, or who buys it. The major sources of product differentiation are as follows.
*Differences in quality which are usually accompanied by differences in price
*Differences in functional features or design
*Ignorance of buyers regarding the essential characteristics and qualities of goods they are purchasing
*Sales promotion activities of sellers and, in particular, advertising
*Differences in availability (e.g. timing and location).

The objective of differentiation is to develop a position that potential customers see as unique. The term is used frequently when dealing with freemium business models, in which businesses market a free and paid version of a given product. Given they target the same group of customers, it is imperative that free and paid versions be effectively differentiated.

Differentiation primarily affects performance through reducing directness of competition: as the product becomes more different, categorization becomes more difficult and hence draws fewer comparisons with its competition. A successful product differentiation strategy will move a product from competing based primarily on price to competing on non-price factors (such as product characteristics, distribution strategy, or promotional variables).

Most people would say that the implication of differentiation is the possibility of charging a price premium; however, this is an over-simplification. If customers value the firm&#x27;s offer, they will be less sensitive to aspects of competing offers; price may not be one of these aspects. Differentiation makes customers in a given segment have a lower sensitivity to other features (non-price) of the product. 

== History ==
Edward Chamberlin’s (1933) seminal work on monopolistic competition mentioned the theory of differentiation, which maintained that for available products within the same industry, customers may have different preferences. However, a generic strategy of differentiation popularized by Michael Porter (1980) proposed that differentiation is any product (tangible or intangible) perceived as “being unique” by at least one set of customers. Hence, it depends on customers&#x27; perception of the extent of product differentiation. Even until 1999, the consequences of these concepts were not well understood. In fact, Miller (1986) proposed marketing and innovation as two differentiation strategies, which was supported by some scholars like Lee and Miller (1999). Mintzberg (1988) proposed more specific but broad categories: quality, design, support, image, price, and undifferentiated products, which received support from Kotha and Vadlamani (1995). However, IO literature (Ethiraj &amp; Zhu, 2008; Makadok, 2010, 2011) did deeper analysis into the theory and explored a clear distinction between the wide use of vertical and horizontal differentiation.

== Vertical product differentiation ==
Vertical product differentiation can be measured objectively by a consumer. For example, when comparing two similar products, the quality and price can clearly be identified and ranked by the customer. If both A and B products have the same price to the consumer, then the market share for each one will be positive, according to the Hotelling model. The major theory in this is that all consumers prefer the higher quality product if two distinct products are offered at the same price. A product can differ in many vertical attributes such as its operating speed. What really matters is the relationship between consumers&#x27; willingness to pay for improvements in quality and the increase in cost per unit that comes with such improvements. Therefore, the perceived difference in quality is different among different consumers, so it is objective. For example, a green product might have a lower or zero negative effect on the environment; however, it may turn out to be inferior to other products in other aspects. Hence, the product&#x27;s appeal also depends on the way it is advertised and the social pressure felt by a potential consumer. Even one vertical differentiation can be a decisive factor in purchasing. 

== Horizontal product differentiation ==
Horizontal differentiation seeks to affect an individual&#x27;s subjective decision-making, that is the difference cannot be measured in an objective way. For example, different color versions of the same iPhone or MacBook. A lemon ice cream is not superior to a chocolate ice cream, is completely based on the user&#x27;s preference. A restaurant may price all of its desserts at the same price and lets the consumer freely choose its preferences since all the alternatives cost the same. A clear example of Horizontal Product Differentiation can be seen when comparing Coca Cola and Pepsi: if priced the same then individuals will differentiate between the two based purely on their own taste preference.

== Other types of product differentiation ==
Whilst Product differentiation is typically broken into two types Vertical and Horizontal, it&#x27;s important to note that all products exhibit a combination of both and they are not the only way to define differentiation. Another way to differentiate a product is through spatial differentiation. Spatial Product Differentiation is using a geographical location as a way to differentiate. An example of Spatial Differentiation is a firm locally sourcing inputs and producing their product.

== Substitute goods and product differentiation ==
According to research conducted by combining mathematics and economics, decisions of pricing depend on the substitutability between products, the level of substitutability varies as the degree of differentiation between firms’ products change. A firm cannot charge a higher price if products are good substitutes, conversely as a product deviates from others in the segment producers can begin to charge a higher price. The lower non-cooperative equilibrium price the lower the differentiation. For this reason, firms might jointly raise prices above the equilibrium or competitive level by coordination between themselves. They have a verbal or written collusion agreement between them. Firms operating in a market of low product differentiation might not coordinate with others, which increases the incentive to cheat the collusion agreement. If a firm slightly lowers there prices, they can capture a large fraction of the market and obtain short term profits if the products are highly substitutable.

== Implications of product differentiation ==
Product differentiation within a given market segment can have both positive and negative affects on the consumer. From the producers perspective building a different product compared to competitors can create a competitive advantage which can result in higher profits. Through differentiation consumers gain greater value from a product, however this leads to increased demand and market segmentation which can cause anti-competitive effects on price. From this perspective greater diversity leads to more choices which means each individual can purchase a product better suited to themselves, the negative to this is prices within the market segment tend to rise. The level of differentiation between goods can also affect demand. For example within grocery stores, If a category of goods is relatively nondifferentiated then a high amount of assortment depth leads to less sales. 

== Interaction between horizontal and vertical differentiation: an application to banking ==
During the 1990s, steps taken by government on deregulation and European integration persuaded banks to compete for deposits on many factors like deposit rates, accessibility and the quality of financial services.

In this example using the Hotelling model, one feature is of variety (location) and one feature of quality (remote access). Remote access using bank services via postal and telephonic services like arranging payment facilities and obtaining account information). In this model, banks cannot become vertically differentiated without negatively affecting horizontal differentiation between them.

Horizontal differentiation occurs with the location of bank&#x27;s branch. Vertical differentiation, in this example, occurs whenever one bank offers remote access and the other does not. With remote access, it can spur a negative interaction between transportation rate and taste for quality: customers who have higher taste for remote access face a lower transportation rate.

A depositor with a high (low) taste for remote access has low (high) linear transportation costs. Different equilibria emerge as the result of two effects. On the one hand, introducing remote access steals depositors from your competitor because the product specification becomes more appealing (direct effect). On the other hand, banks become closer substitutes (indirect effect). First, banks become closer substitutes as the impact of linear transportation costs decreases. Second, deposit rate competition is affected by the size of the quality difference. These two effects, &quot;stealing&quot; depositors versus &quot;substitutability&quot; between banks, determines the equilibrium. For low and high values of the ratio quality difference to transportation rate, only one bank offers remote access (specialization). Intermediate (very low) values of the ratio quality difference to transportation costs yield universal (no) remote access.

This competition is a two factor game: one is of offering of remote access and the other is of deposit rates. Hypothetically, there will be two consequential scenarios if only one bank offers remote access. First, the bank gains a positive market share for all types of remote access, giving rise to horizontal dominance. This occurs when the transportation cost prevail over the quality of service, deposit rate and time. Second, vertical dominance comes into picture when the bank that is not offering remote access gets the entire market for depositors who have lowest preference for remote access. That is when the quality service, deposit rate and time prevails over the cost of transportation.

<text>Focke-Achgelis &amp; Co. G.m.b.H. was a German helicopter company founded in 1937 by Henrich Focke and Gerd Achgelis.

==History==
Henrich Focke was ousted in 1936 from the Focke-Wulf company, which he had cofounded in 1924, due to shareholder pressure. There is reason to believe that Focke&#x27;s removal was to allow Focke-Wulf&#x27;s manufacturing capacity to be used to produce Bf 109 aircraft. The company was taken over by AEG, but soon after this the Air Ministry, which had been impressed by the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 helicopter, suggested that Focke establish a new company dedicated to helicopter development, and issued him with a requirement for an improved design, capable of carrying a payload.

Focke established the Focke-Achgelis company at Hoykenkamp, Germany, on 27 April 1937, in partnership with pilot Gerd Achgelis, and began development work at Delmenhorst later that year.

==Designs==

<text>Henrich Focke (8 October 1890 – 25 February 1979) was a German aviation pioneer from Bremen and also a co-founder of the Focke-Wulf company. He is best known as the inventor of the Fw 61, the first successful, practical, and fully controllable helicopter, first flown in 1936. He has been called &quot;father of the helicoper&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Henrich Focke was born in Bremen on 8 October 1890, Focke studied at Leibniz University Hannover, where he became friends with Georg Wulf in 1911.
In 1914, he and Wulf both reported for military service and Focke was deferred due to heart problems, but was eventually drafted into an infantry regiment. After serving on the Eastern front, he was transferred to the Imperial German Army Air Service.

Focke graduated in 1920 as Dipl-Ing with distinction. His first job was with the Francke Company of Bremen as a designer of water-gas systems.

===Focke-Wulf and Focke-Achgelis===
In 1923, with Wulf and Dr. Werner Naumann, Focke co-founded Focke-Wulf-Flugzeugbau GmbH. In 1927 Wulf died while test flying the Focke-Wulf F 19 canard monoplane.

In 1930 Focke was offered a chair at the Danzig Institute of Technology, an honour which he declined. In 1931 the city of Bremen awarded him the title of Professor. The same year, Focke-Wulf was merged with the Albatros Flugzeugwerke company.

Focke-Wulf constructed Juan de la Cierva&#x27;s C.19 and C.30 autogyros under license from 1933, and Focke was inspired by it to design the world&#x27;s first practical helicopter, the Focke-Wulf Fw 61, which first flew on 26 June 1936 by Hanna Reitsch. In the Deutschlandhalle arena in 1938, it also became the first practical helicopter to be flown indoors.

In 1936 Focke was ousted from the Focke-Wulf company by shareholder pressure. Though the ostensible reason was that he was considered &quot;politically unreliable&quot; by the Nazi regime, there is reason to believe it was so that Focke-Wulf&#x27;s manufacturing capacity could be used to produce Bf 109 aircraft. The company was taken over by AEG, but soon after this the Air Ministry, which had been impressed by the Fw 61 helicopter, suggested that Focke establish a new company dedicated to helicopter development and issued him with a requirement for an improved design capable of carrying a payload.

Focke established the Focke-Achgelis company on 27 April 1937 in partnership with pilot Gerd Achgelis, and began development work at Delmenhorst in 1938. The new company built the experimental Fa 225 using the fuselage of a DFS 230 glider and a rotor from a Fa 223. Another project was the Fa 330 kite with rotor, capable of being deployed by a submarine at a moments notice and then used as a towed spotter. It was stored in a watertight container on the deck of the U-boat and was used during the war. A powered version of the kite would have been the Fa 336 which was in the design phase when the war ended and built in France postwar for testing.

Focke subsequently manufactured the heavy-lift transport helicopter Fa 223, and designed the Fa 224, Fa 266, Fa 269, Fa 283, Fa 284, and the Fa 336 during World War II. Only a few of the large Fa 223 &quot;Drache&quot; (&quot;Dragon&quot;) helicopters actually were produced, but even the prototype set a new helicopter speed record of and climb record of in 1940. Subsequent war models were primarily used as mountain troop transport, rescue, and crashed aircraft recovery. The helicopter had provision for a nose-mounted machine gun, and could carry one or two bombs, but the &quot;Drache&quot; was never used for combat.

Towards the end of Nazi Germany Focke started design work on the Focke Rochen, also known as &quot;Schnellflugzeug&quot;.

===Postwar===

On 1 September 1945, Focke signed a contract with the French company SNCASE and assisted in development of their SE-3000 passenger helicopter, which was based on the Focke-Achgelis Fa 223 &quot;Drache&quot; and which first flew in 1948.

In 1950, he worked as a designer with the North German Automobile Company (Nordwestdeutscher Fahrzeugbau) of Wilhelmshaven.

In 1952, Focke and other members of his former design team were employed by Brazil&#x27;s Centro Técnico Aeroespacial (CTA), at the time the air force&#x27;s technical center, to develop a Convertiplane, the &quot;Convertiplano&quot;, which drew heavily on Focke&#x27;s wartime work on the Fa 269. Also recruited was Bussmann, a transmission specialist formerly of BMW. The Convertiplano was built using the fuselage and wings of a Supermarine Spitfire Mk 15, which was believed to be one delivered to Argentina as a sales example. Britain refused to supply the Armstrong Siddeley Double Mamba engine originally selected and the design was altered to accept a mid-mounted 2200 hp Wright engine instead as used in the Lockheed Constellation, which necessitated a redesign of the transmission due to the increase in weight and vibration. Some 40 workers and US$8 million were devoted to the project, and more than 300 takeoffs were achieved.

While working at the CTA Focke also developed the BF-1 &quot;Beija-Flor&quot; (hummingbird) two-seater light helicopter from 1954, which made its first flight at Sao Jose dos Campos on 22 January 1959. The BF-1 was similar in design to the Cessna CH-1, with a 225 hp Continental E225 engine in the nose and the rotor mast running vertically between the front seats. An open structure tubular steel tail boom carried a pair of tail surfaces and a small tail rotor. The BF-2 was developed from this and first flew on 1 January 1959, and performed an extended flight-testing campaign until it was damaged in an accident. It is thought that further work on the &quot;Beija Flor&quot; was then abandoned.

Focke returned permanently to Germany in 1956 and began developing a three-seater helicopter named the &quot;Kolibri&quot; (&quot;hummingbird&quot;) at the Borgward company in Bremen, with its first flight taking place in 1958. While working at Borgward Focke set up a wind tunnel in a disused hangar in central Bremen; this wind tunnel was rediscovered in 1997 and is today the centerpiece of a museum devoted to him.

After Borgward collapsed in 1961, Focke became a consulting engineer with Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke of Bremen and Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Luft-und Raumfahrt. Focke was awarded the Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring from the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for &quot;outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering&quot; in 1961. Focke died in Bremen on 25 February 1979.

In 1993, Focke was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

<text>Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW; English: &quot;United Aviation Engineering Works&quot;) was a West German aerospace manufacturer.

The company was formed by the 1964 merger of two German aerospace firms, Focke-Wulf and Weser Flugzeugbau GmbH (Weserflug). The formation of VFW was a natural outcome, as the two companies had been collaborating, along with Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HFB), in the rocket technology development alliance Entwicklungsring Nord (ERNO) group since 1961, the move was seen as a natural fit. Such collaborative efforts continued throughout VFW&#x27;s operating years, not just through ERNO but also with the Dutch aircraft producer Fokker, who formed a joint venture with the firm, VFW-Fokker GmbH, during 1969 to promote.

Collaboration with Fokker waned substantially over the years, having been greatly soured by the poor results of the VFW 614 programme, resulting in VFW-Fokker GmbH being wound up in 1980. During 1981, VFW was acquired by its domestic rival, Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB), and was largely integrated into it. Through various mergers and acquisitions, the present-day successor company to VFW is the multinational Airbus Group. The firm&#x27;s space-based activities under ERNO has also been integrated into one of Airbus&#x27;s operating divisions.

==History==
===Formation and the VFW 614===
During the early 1960s, the government of West Germany promoted the reorganisation and consolidation of its aircraft manufacturing sector; furthermore, as many of these companies were already collaborating on various programmes, such integration was a somewhat logical outcome. During 1964, two such companies, Focke-Wulf and Weser Flugzeugbau GmbH (Weserflug), opted to merge, the resulting combined entity that emerged being &quot;Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke&quot; (VFW), based at Bremen, Germany.

A key programme undertaken by VFW was the VFW 614 short-haul airliner, which had been proposed prior to its formation by its predecessor companies. The basic design of this aircraft was heavily influenced by the pre-war American piston-engine Douglas DC-3 passenger aircraft. During 1968, having secured considerable financial backing from the West German Government, the programme was given the go-ahead. The VFW 614 was considerably shaped by technical assistance provided by the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker; several early changes to the VFW 614&#x27;s design, including the discarding of a T-tail in favour of a conventional unit, furnished with a low-set vertical stabilizer and dihedral, has been accredited to Fokker&#x27;s input into the programme. By the time that full-scale production of the VFW 614 had been approved in 1970, VFW had opted to merge its fledgling commercial aircraft activities with those of Fokker, creating the joint venture company VFW-Fokker GmbH for this purpose; this entity has the distinction of being Europe&#x27;s first transnational aircraft company.
As envisioned, Fokker&#x27;s established civil sales unit and support infrastructure was to be used to support the VFW 614 programme; however, the union has been regarded by some commentators as having been an &#x27;unhappy arrangement&#x27;. The programme suffered several early blows, including the loss of the first prototype on 1 February 1972, which was attributed to an instance of elevator flutter. VFW had also taken the relatively bold decision to develop both an entirely new airframe and a new engine in parallel; the latter element being impacted by Rolls-Royce&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1971, effectively threatening the supply of the only suitable engines for the airliner. By February 1975, only ten aircraft had been ordered. During April 1975, the first production VFW 614 made its first flight; it was delivered to Denmark&#x27;s Cimber Air four months later.

However, perhaps the most major potential customer, West Germany&#x27;s flagcarrier airline Lufthansa, declined to procure any VFW 614s; the company having prioritised the development of its long haul routes, for which the type was not applicable, while the German government had also declined to pressure the airline to purchase it. According to authors H. Dienel and P. Lyth, Lufthansa&#x27;s lack of interest in the type was attributed as having been a major factor in the commercial failure of the VFW 614. According to author Mark E. Mendenhall, the management within VFW-Fokker was divided and split along national lines; while a number of German figures within the company attributed the poor sales performance to the Dutch sales team having paid the type little heed, even allegedly regarding it as a competitor to Fokker&#x27;s established product lines for orders, and that salesmen had prioritised the promotion of Dutch-designed airliners instead. Reportedly, some Dutch managers did hold a preference for their own aircraft, regarding them as established successes and the VFW 614 as a waste of effort to market; furthermore, Dutch management was alleged by Mendenhall to have interfered with the firm&#x27;s marketing structure to curtail independence and maintain support for their own aircraft.

===Other activities===
At the time of VFW&#x27;s formation, the company&#x27;s management was heavy interested in developing its own VTOL strike aircraft. Around this era, multiple companies had been working on their own conceptual designs for VTOL-capable interceptor aircraft; in order for these designs to be operationally relevant and viable, it was recognised that it would be necessary for the flight performance to equal that of conventional interceptors of the era, such as the contemporary Lockheed F-104G Starfighter. Over time, two separate and distinct requirements emerged, one calling for a VTOL-capable successor to the F-104G interceptor while the other sought a VTOL successor to the Italian Fiat G.91 ground-attack fighter. According to aerospace publication Flight International, this call for a Fiat G.91 replacement, which came under a NATO requirement, known as NBMR-3, was a crucial trigger and greatly influenced the development programme that would lead to VFW&#x27;s VTOL effort, designated as the VAK 191B.
Initially, Italian aircraft manufacturer Fiat was also a participating company in VFW, however, Italy later chose to withdraw from the joint development agreement with Germany during 1967. Despite this decision, Fiat remained as a major sub-contractor for the venture, being responsible for the production of various structural elements such as wings, tailplanes and some of the fuselage. However, even prior to the first flight of the type, the programme had been heavily affected by political changes. Amongst these were the effective irrelevance of the original NBRM-3 requirement and the decreasing importance of the strike mission as a result of a German government decision to abandon the nuclear role, a divergence of opinion between partner countries, the withdrawal of the Italian government from participation during August 1967, and a growing awareness of the programme&#x27;s escalating costs. At one stage, the Italian government had agreed to take on 40 per cent of the programme&#x27;s development costs, thus their departure meant that a substantial amount of funding was lost for the venture.

The emergence of a new German/American &quot;Advanced Vertical Strike&quot; (AVS) programme also diminished the type&#x27;s perceived value; the prospective aircraft which was on offer from the Americans via a cooperative venture with Germany somewhat eclipsed the VAK 191B in the eyes of the German Air Force and served to effectively undermine support for the programme. During 1968, VFW decided that the VAK 191B should be reclassified as an experimental programme, and that the aircraft should principally function only as a technology demonstrator. The initial programme had called for the construction of three single-seater and three two-seater aircraft; however, amid escalating costs, this intended test batch was first converted to become six single-seat aircraft, and was later on cut down to only involve three single-seat aircraft following Italy&#x27;s withdrawal.

Likely the most impactful and successor programme that VFW was involved in was the Transall C-160 military transport aircraft. It was developed and manufactured by a consortium, &quot;Transporter-Allianz&quot; or Transall, which had been formed in January 1959 between the French company Nord Aviation and the German companies Weser Flugzeugbau (which later merged into VFW) and Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HFB) to design and build the new transport. A single prototype was built by each of the production partners, with the first (built by Nord) flying on 25 May 1963, with the VFW and HFB-built prototypes following on 25 May 1963 and 19 February 1964. These were followed by six pre-production examples, stretched by compared with the prototypes, which flew between 1965 and 1966.

On 24 September 1964, a sizable contract for a total of 160 C-160s was signed, comprising 110 for Germany and 50 for France. Manufacturing work was split between Germany and France in line with the number of orders placed; Nord built the wings and engine nacelles, VFW the centre fuselage and horizontal tail, and HFB the forward and rear fuselage. The aircraft&#x27;s tail fin was also built by Dornier. Three separate production lines were established to assemble these components at each of the three main partners. The first production airframes were delivered to France and Germany from 1967. The first batch included 110 &quot;C-160D&quot;s for the German Air Force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;), 50 &quot;C-160F&quot;s for the French Air Force, and nine &quot;C-160Z&quot;s for the South African Air Force. Four C-160Fs were converted to &quot;C-160P&quot; air mail transport aircraft, and were operated by Air France. Production continued until October 1972. Production of the type persisted throughout VFW&#x27;s existence, and for several years further through its successors.

===Fate===
During 1981, VFW was acquired by, and subsequently integrated into, the German aerospace company Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB), which in its turn was taken over by DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (DASA) in 1989. In July 2000, DASA merged with the French aerospace company Aerospatiale-Matra and the Spanish aircraft manufacturer CASA to form European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), which rebranded itself as the multinational Airbus Group in 2015.

Into the twenty-first century, the Entwicklungsring Nord (ERNO)/VFW descendant has continued to be active as the space infrastructure division of Airbus&#x27;s Astrium business unit. Amongst its activities, the company has contributed various components of both the European Ariane space launch system and the International Space Station. During June 2003, this unit became part of EADS SPACE Transportation.

<text>Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HFB) was an aircraft manufacturer, located primarily in the Finkenwerder quarter of Hamburg, Germany. Established in 1933 as an offshoot of Blohm &amp; Voss shipbuilders, it later became an operating division within its parent company and was known as Abteilung Flugzeugbau der Schiffswerft Blohm &amp; Voss from 1937 until it ceased operation at the end of World War II. In the postwar period it was revived as an independent company under its original name and subsequently joined several consortia before being merged to form Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB). It participates in the present day Airbus and European aerospace programs.

==History==
In 1933 the Blohm &amp; Voss shipbuilding company in Hamburg was suffering a financial crisis from lack of work. Its owners, brothers Rudolf and Walther Blohm, decided to diversify into aircraft manufacture, believing that there would soon be a market for all-metal, long-range flying boats, especially with the German state airline Deutsche Luft Hansa. They also felt that their experience with all-metal marine construction would prove an advantage. It was at that time commonly believed that transatlantic air transport would soon take over the role filled by the luxury liners of that time. It was also thought that those planes would be seaplanes and flying boats as they could use the infrastructure and capacity of the seaports already in place, while land facilities at that time were unsuited to such large aeroplanes.

===Early years===
In June 1933 the Blohm brothers appointed their brother-in-law and fellow B&amp;V director Dipl-Ing Max Andreae and experienced aviator Robert Schröck to the board. Schröck recruited designer Reinhold Mewes away from Heinkel, and with four other designers, on 1 July they began work. The Hamburger Flugzeugbau GmBH officially came into being on 4 July.

The company offices at first occupied the top floor of the B&amp;V administrative headquarters in the Steinwerder quarter of Hamburg, with manufacturing carried out in the under-utilised shipbuilding works. Meanwhile an inland airfield and final assembly building for landplanes were begun a few miles away at Wenzendorf Aircraft Factory, opened in 1935.

During this period the ruling Nazi party was massively increasing the interwar German re-armament program which included the complete overhaul of the aircraft industry. In particular, the Nazis wanted the technical capacities to quickly build large numbers of warplanes for the new &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. As a result, the company took on subcontract manufacture of Junkers Ju 52 subassemblies, thus gaining valuable experience in the manufacture of all-metal aircraft. The bulk of the company&#x27;s output would eventually turn out to be contract manufacturing of this kind, including many thousands of aircraft each for Dornier, Focke-Wulf, Heinkel, Junkers, and Messerschmitt.
The company&#x27;s own designs were designated with the official RLM company code &quot;Ha&quot;. The first to be built was the Ha 135. Mewes was unfamiliar with advanced techniques such as all-metal construction and designed a conventional biplane with fabric covering. The Blohm Brothers had wanted a more radically advanced approach and, unhappy with Mewes, sought the advice of the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM). On their recommendation the company offered the job of Chief Designer to Richard Vogt, who was then occupying that same position at Kawasaki in Japan and was experienced in all-metal construction. Vogt accepted and arrived during late autumn, while the Ha 135 was still under construction. For a while the company maintained two design teams in separate offices.

The Ha 135 took off on its first flight on 28 April 1934. However it failed to attract any orders and Mewes and his team soon left the company.

Vogt proved highly innovative and many of his designs would have unusual features, from the very first incorporating a tubular steel wing main spar which also doubled as the fuel tank. He oversaw all the remaining types, until the company&#x27;s closure in 1945.

In May 1934 Vogt&#x27;s team was joined by Hans Amtmann, coming like Mewes from Heinkel and bringing to the team his experience of large flying boats. Amtmann made a good impression and was soon appointed Head of Preliminary Design. Other members included Richard Schubert as Head of Aerodynamics and George Haag as head of wing design.

The only type to enter service during this period was the Ha 139 long-range seaplane mail carrier. Despite its size, with four engines, it was designed to be launched from a shipborne catapult to help extend its range, and was successfully operated in small numbers by Deutsche Luft Hansa. A landplane variant, the Ha 142, was also built for the airline.

===Blohm &amp; Voss adoption===

The aircraft produced by &quot;Hamburger Flugzeugbau&quot; were still commonly associated with Blohm &amp; Voss and this was causing confusion, so in September 1937 &quot;Hamburger Flugzeugbau&quot; was renamed &quot;Abteilung Flugzeugbau der Schiffswerft Blohm &amp; Voss&quot; (&quot;Aircraft manufacturing division of Blohm &amp; Voss shipbuilder&quot;). The RLM changed the official aircraft type designation code to &quot;BV&quot;. Some designs already under development as Ha types were reassigned a BV designation, for example the Ha 138 became the BV 138.

In 1939, with the shipbuilding work revived and production capacity fully utilised again, B&amp;V moved its aircraft subsidiary, including both offices and seaplane manufacturing, to a purpose-built site on the shores of the river Elbe, at Finkenwerder.

The most significant types to be produced were flying boats, mainly used by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; for maritime patrol and reconnaissance. Most numerous was the BV 138 &quot;Seedrache&quot; (initiated as the Ha 138), a twin-boom trimotor, while the BV 222 &quot;Wiking&quot; was much larger. Largest of all was the BV 238 prototype, the largest aircraft built by any of the Axis powers. Other notable types include the asymmetric BV 141 tactical reconnaissance aircraft; 20 were built, but the type did not enter full production as the Focke-Wulf Fw 189 &quot;Uhu&quot; was preferred.

The intention at Finkenwerder was to manufacture B&amp;V&#x27;s own products there, but subcontract manufacture quickly ate up most of the space and much of the company&#x27;s own production, such as the BV 138, was in turn subcontracted out to Weser Flugzeugbau. Remarkably, the Finkenwerder site would survive the Allied bombing of Hamburg during the war and would remain with the company.

During the war, Vogt&#x27;s workload increased so much that Hermann Pohlmann, designer of the Junkers Ju 87, was recruited to be his deputy. Other notable projects of the later part of the war included a variety of highly original bomber and fighter designs, including a series of tailless swept-wing fighters which culminated in an order for three prototypes of the jet-powered P 215 night fighter, just weeks before the war ended.

===Postwar revival===

At the end of the war, all aircraft production in Germany was shut down. Vogt and Amtmann were swept up by the American Operation Paperclip and made new careers over there. Pohlmann remained in Germany.

In 1955 Germany was allowed to build civil aircraft once again. The main works at Finkenwerder was still there and &quot;Hamburger Flugzeugbau GmbH&quot; (HFB) re-emerged in 1956, still under the ownership of Walther Blohm but no longer connected to B+V. Blohm tried to tempt Vogt back from the US, but without success and Pohlmann returned to the company to become the new chief designer. Another significant recruit was Hans Wocke, who headed up the engineering team.

As ever, the company&#x27;s main work would turn out to be as subcontractor for various German – and increasingly European – aircraft projects, and to this end it would participate in a number of consortia. Its first contract was for fuselage manufacture and final assembly of the Nord Noratlas. Other significant work would be undertaken for the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Lockheed F-104G Starfighter and as a partner in the Transall C-160 military transport.

In 1958 HFB proposed two civil transport projects. The HFB 209 was a twin-turpoprop capable of carrying 48 passengers, while the HFB 314 was a short-haul twin-jet. But the anticipated funding from the German government was not made available and the projects were cancelled in the early 1960s.

In 1961, HFB and Focke-Wulf/Weserflug (VFW-Fokker) jointly formed the &quot;Entwicklungsring Nord&quot; (ERNO) to develop air and space products. Work would be carried out for the Dornier Do 31 V/STOL transport and, later, in direct collaboration on the Fokker F28 Fellowship.

The only aircraft type to be both designed and built by the new HFB was the HFB 320 Hansa Jet, a business jet with forward-swept wings, which first flew in 1964 and was made in moderate numbers.

In May 1969, HFB merged with Messerschmitt-Bölkow to form Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB), which in turn was taken over by Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) in September 1989. DASA has since been absorbed into the pan-European Airbus corporation. Airbus has since built a significant presence around the original HFB team and operates the airfield privately as Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport.

==Aircraft and related products==
===Hamburger Flugzeugbau (prewar)===
Some of these types were still under construction when the company name was changed to B&amp;V and flew only under the new name. But only those whose design and development continued under B&amp;V were redesignated.
* Ha 135. Conventional biplane trainer prototype, designed by Reinhold Mewes.
* Ha 136. All-metal monoplane trainer prototype. First to incorporate Vogt&#x27;s trademark cylindrical main spar with integral fuel tank.
* Ha 137. Dive bomber prototype.
* Ha 138. Twin-boom flying boat prototype. Entered production as the BV 138 (see below).
* Ha 139. Long-range seaplane mail carrier, operated in small numbers by Deutsche Luft Hansa. Later redesignated the BV 139.
* Ha 140 Torpedo bomber seaplane prototype. Later redesignated the BV 140.
* Ha 141 Asymmetric reconnaissance prototype. Further developed as the BV 141 (see below).
* Ha 142. Landplane derivative of the Ha 139. The prototypes were later pressed into service as the BV 142.
* Ha 222. Design proposal, would later be built as the BV 222.

===Blohm &amp; Voss===
====Aircraft designed and flown====
* BV 138 &quot;Seedrache&quot; (sea-dragon), originally designated Ha 138. Trimotor maritime patrol flying-boat. Only type to enter both series production and operational service, some were built under subcontract by Weserflug.
* BV 141, originally designated Ha 141. Asymmetric reconnaissance prototypes. Some 20 pre-production examples delivered but none saw operational service.
* BV 144. transport with variable-pitch wing. Two built in France by Breguet.
* BV 155. High-altitude interceptor prototype, derived from the Messerschmitt Me 155 project.
* BV 222. &quot;Wiking&quot; (Viking). Six-engine transport flying-boat. Some twelve pre-production examples saw operational service.
* BV 238. Flying-boat prototype, the largest Axis aircraft design of the war years to fly.
* BV 40. Glider interceptor prototype. Several examples flown but not yet operational by the end of hostilities. 

Of these aircraft, few entered operational service and only one, the BV 138 &quot;Fliegende Holzschuh&quot; (flying clog), attained serial production. All other aircraft either remained prototypes or were limited to a small number of pre-series/purpose build machines. Nevertheless, work was sufficient to require a second manufacturing plant at Finkenwerder.

The largest aircraft ever designed and built by any of the Axis powers of World War II, the BV 238, resembled an enlarged BV 222, with only one prototype aircraft built and flown.

====Munitions developed====
Besides aircraft, during World War II B&amp;V also developed a number of air-launched munitions such as glide bombs and torpedoes. Although the company built thousands of examples during development, none entered operational service. These were:
* BV 143. Glide bomb prototype.
* BV 246 &quot;Hagelkorn&quot; (Hailstone), originally designated BV 226. Long-range radar-homing glide bomb prototype.
* BV 950 Gliding torpedo prototype, built in two variants:
** L 10 &quot;Friedensengel&quot;. Torpedo with glider attachment.
** L 11 &quot;Schneewittchen&quot;. Later and more advanced derivative.

====Design projects====
Vogt proved a highly innovative designer and many of his projects gained interest within the German aero community. B&amp;V explored several main themes of interest, each through a series of design projects and proposals. These included; large maritime aircraft &quot;stuka&quot; dive bomber / ground attack replacements for the Junkers Ju 87, fast bombers and advanced fighters. Many studies had unusual configurations such as asymmetry, novel multi-engine layouts and crew locations, wings swept forwards or back (or both) and sometimes tailless. All these lines of study followed through into the jet age, some with piston+jet mixed-power engine combinations.

Significant internal projects of the World War II era included:

Transports:
* P 200. Long-range passenger flying boat.
* BV 250. Landplane variant of the BV 238.

Bombers:
* BV 237. Single-seat dive bomber and ground attack development of the asymmetric Bv 141. Personally ordered by Hitler as a replacement for the ageing Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; but later cancelled.
* P 163. Fast bomber with twin engines coupled to a central contra-prop, and manned wingtip nacelles.
* P 170. Fast bomber with three engines, one central and two on unmanned wingtip nacelles.
* P 188. W-wing jet bomber.

Fighters:
* P 202. Slewed wing variable-geometry jet fighter.
* P 203. Multi-role attack aircraft, mixed piston &amp; jet power.
* P 208. Tailless swept piston-engined pusher fighter project.
* P 211. Jet fighter for the &quot;Volksjäger&quot; Emergency Fighter Program competition.
* P 212. Single engined jet fighter.
* P 213. Pulsejet powered miniature fighter for the &quot;Miniaturjäger&quot; design competition of the Emergency Fighter Program.
* P 215. Tailless swept-wing twinjet, developed from the P 208 and P 212 design studies. An order for three prototypes was received just weeks before the end of the war.

===Hamburger Flugzeugbau (postwar)===

* HFB 209. Twin-turpoprop airliner project.
* HFB 314. Short-haul twin-jet project.
* HFB 320 Hansa Jet. Business jet with forward-swept wings.
* Transall C-160. Military transport (major partner).
* Airbus consortium (significant contribution to design and manufacture).

<text>Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is an Indian public sector aerospace and defence company, headquartered in Bengaluru (Bangalore). Established on 23 December 1940, HAL is one of the oldest and largest aerospace and defence manufacturers in the world. HAL began aircraft manufacturing as early as 1942 with licensed production of Harlow PC-5, Curtiss P-36 Hawk and Vultee A-31 Vengeance for the Indian Air Force. HAL currently has 11 dedicated Research and development (R&amp;D) centres and 21 manufacturing divisions under 4 production units spread across India. HAL is managed by a board of directors appointed by the President of India through the Ministry of Defence, Government of India. In 2024, the company was given Maharatna status. HAL is currently involved in the designing and manufacturing of fighter jets, helicopters, jet engine and marine gas turbine engine, avionics, hardware development, spares supply, overhauling and upgrading of Indian military aircraft.

The HAL HF-24 Marut fighter-bomber was the first indigenous fighter aircraft made in India.

==History==
HAL was established as Hindustan Aircraft Limited in Bangalore (now called Bengaluru) on 23 December 1940 by Walchand Hirachand in association with Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV of Kingdom of Mysore. Walchand Hirachand became chairman of the company. The company&#x27;s office was opened at a bungalow called &quot;Eventide&quot; on Domlur Road.

The organisation and equipment for the factory at Bengaluru was set up by William D. Pawley of the Intercontinental Aircraft Corporation of New York. Pawley obtained a large number of machine-tools and equipment from the United States.

The Mysore Kingdom bought a one-third stake in the company until April 1941 by investing ₹25 lakh as it believed this to be a strategic imperative. The decision by the government was primarily motivated to boost British military supplies in Asia to counter the increasing threat posed by Imperial Japan during Second World War. The Kingdom of Mysore supplied two directors, Air Marshal John Higgins was resident director. The first aircraft built was a Harlow PC-5. On 2 April 1942, the government announced that the company had been nationalised when it bought out the stakes of Seth Walchand Hirachand and other promoters so that it could act freely. The Mysore Kingdom refused to sell its stake in the company but yielded the management control over to the British Indian Government.

In 1943 the Bengaluru factory was handed over to the United States Army Air Forces but still using Hindustan Aircraft management. The factory expanded rapidly and became the centre for major overhaul and repair of American aircraft and was known as the 84th Air Depot. The first aircraft to be overhauled was a Consolidated PBY Catalina followed by every type of aircraft operated in India and Burma. When returned to Indian control two years later the factory had become one of the largest overhaul and repair organisations in the East. In the post war reorganisation the company built railway carriages as an interim activity.
After India gained independence in 1947, the management of the company was passed over to the Government of India.

The total number of broad-gauge coaches manufactured by the Hindustan Aircraft Limited during the year 1954 is 158. 
Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) was formed on 1 October 1964 (the Registrar of Companies has a registration date of 16 August 1963) when Hindustan Aircraft Limited joined the consortium formed in June by the IAF Aircraft Manufacturing Depot, Kanpur (at the time manufacturing HS748 under licence) and the group recently set up to manufacture MiG-21 under licence, with its new factories planned in Koraput, Nasik and Hyderabad. Though HAL was not used actively for developing newer models of fighter jets, except for the HF-24 Marut, the company has played a crucial role in modernisation of the Indian Air Force. In 1957, the company started manufacturing Bristol Siddeley Orpheus jet engines under licence at new factory located in Bengaluru.
During the 1980s, HAL&#x27;s operations saw a rapid increase which resulted in the development of new indigenous aircraft such as the HAL Tejas and HAL Dhruv. HAL also developed an advanced version of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, known as MiG-21 &quot;Bison&quot;, which increased its life-span by more than 20 years. HAL has also obtained several multimillion-dollar contracts from leading international aerospace firms such as Airbus, Boeing and Honeywell to manufacture aircraft spare parts and engines.

By 2012, HAL was reportedly bogged down in the details of production and has been slipping on its schedules. On 1 April 2015, HAL reconstituted its Board with TS Raju as CMD, S Subrahmanyan as Director (Operations), VM Chamola as Director (HR), CA Ramana Rao as Director (Finance) and D K Venkatesh as Director (Engineering &amp; R&amp;D). There are two government nominees in the board and six independent directors.

In March 2017, HAL&#x27;s chairman and managing director T Suvarna Raju announced that the company had finalised plans for an indigenisation drive. The company plans to produce nearly 1, 000 military helicopters, including Kamov 226, LCH (Light Combat Helicopter) ALH (Advanced Light Helicopter), and over 100 planes over the next 10 years. HAL will manufacture the Kamov 226T helicopter under a joint venture agreement with Russian defence manufacturers. The Kamov 226T will replace the country&#x27;s fleet of Cheetah and Chetak helicopters. Over the next 5 years, HAL will carry out major upgrades of almost the entire fighter fleet of the Indian Air Force, including Su-30MKI, Jaguars, Mirage and Hawk jets, to make them &quot;more lethal&quot;. The company will also deliver 123 Tejas Light Combat Aircraft to the IAF from 2018 to 2019, at a rate of 16 jets per year. LCH production will now take place in a newly built Light Combat Helicopter Production Hangar at Helicopter Division in HAL Complex.

In view of the Make in India policy and to increase the share of defence exports to achieve the target of $5 billion by 2025, HAL is planning to set up logistic bases in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam with priority target for Southeast Asia, West Asia and North African markets. It would not only help to promote HAL products but also act as service centre for Soviet/Russian origin equipment.

In October 2024, HAL was given Maharatna status, which allows the company to have more operational and financial autonomy. 

=== Aero Engine Research and Development Centre ===
On 29 December 2023, Defence Secretary Giridhar Aramane opened a new design and testing facility at the HAL Aero Engine Research and Development Centre (AERDC) in Bengaluru. The engine development projects undertaken by AERDC include:

# PTAE-7 engine, the first indigenous turbojet engine of India. Application: Lakshya target drone.
# Hindustan Turbo Fan Engine-25 (HTFE-25). Application on trainers, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), twin-engine small fighter aircraft. Facility has two test beds for HTFE-25.
# Hindustan Turbo Shaft Engine-1200 (HTSE-1200). Application on light and medium-weight helicopters (3.5 to 6.5 tonne-class; single/twine engine configuration) including HAL Dhruv, HAL Rudra, HAL Prachand and HAL LUH. Facility has one test bed for HTSE-1200.
# Aravalli Engine. Application on Indian Multi Role Helicopter. Development by a joint venture including AERDC and Safran Helicopter Engines — SAFHAL Helicopter Engines.

<doc id="241602" wikidata="Q276469" url="?curid=241602" title="Blister">
<text>A blister is a small pocket of body fluid (lymph, serum, plasma, blood, or pus) within the upper layers of the skin, usually caused by forceful rubbing (friction), burning, freezing, chemical exposure or infection. Most blisters are filled with a clear fluid, either serum or plasma. However, blisters can be filled with blood (known as &quot;blood blisters&quot;) or with pus (for instance, if they become infected).

Smaller blisters are called &quot;blebs&quot;. The word &quot;blister&quot; entered English in the 14th century. It came from the Middle Dutch and was a modification of the Old French , which meant a leprous nodule—a rise in the skin due to leprosy. 

In dermatology, the words &quot;vesicle&quot; and &quot;bulla&quot; refer to blisters of smaller or greater size, respectively.

Some sources recommend not to pop a blister. If popped, bacteria can enter. Excess skin should not necessarily be removed as the top layer protects the soft tissue underneath.

==Causes==


A blister may form when the skin has been damaged by friction or rubbing, heat, cold or chemical exposure. Fluid collects between the upper layers of skin (the epidermis) and the layers below (the dermis). This fluid cushions the tissue underneath, protecting it from further damage and allowing it to heal.

===Friction===
Intense rubbing can cause a blister, as can any friction on the skin if continued long enough. This kind of blister is most common after walking long distances or by wearing old or poorly fitting shoes. Blisters are most common on the hands and feet, as these extremities are susceptible while walking, running, or performing repetitive motions, such as joystick manipulation whilst playing certain video games, certain sports (e.g., baseball pitching), digging with a shovel, playing guitar or bass, etc. Blisters form more easily on damp skin than on dry or soaked skin, and are more common in warm conditions. Less-aggressive rubbing over long periods of time may cause calluses to form rather than a blister. Both blisters and calluses can lead to more serious complications, such as foot ulceration and infection, particularly when sensation or circulation is impaired, as in the case of diabetes, neuropathy or peripheral artery disease (PAD).

===Burning===
This type of blistering is one of the tools used to determine the degree of burns sustained. First and second degree burns may result in blistered skin; however, it is characteristic of second degree burns to blister immediately, whereas first degree burns can have blisters after a couple of days. Sunburn can also result in blisters.

Blisters can also form on the hands and feet as a result of tissue damage incurred by frostbite.

===Chemical exposure===
Sometimes, the skin will blister when it comes into contact with a cosmetic, detergent, solvent, or other chemical such as nickel sulfate, Balsam of Peru, or urushiol (poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac). This is known as contact dermatitis. Blisters can also develop as a result of an allergic reaction to an insect bite or sting. Some chemical warfare agents, known as blister agents or vesicants, cause large, painful blisters wherever they contact skin; an example is mustard gas.

===Blood blister===
A blood blister usually forms when a minute blood vessel close to
the surface of the skin ruptures (breaks), and blood leaks into a tear between the layers of skin. This can happen if the skin is crushed, pinched or aggressively squeezed.

===Medical conditions===
There are also a number of medical conditions that cause blisters. The most common are chickenpox, herpes, impetigo, and a form of eczema called dyshidrosis. Other, much rarer conditions that cause blisters include:
* Bullous pemphigoid: a skin disease that causes large, tightly filled blisters to develop, usually affecting people over the age of 60.
* Pemphigus: a serious skin disease in which blisters develop if pressure is applied to the skin; the blisters burst easily, leaving raw areas that can become infected.
* Dermatitis herpetiformis: a skin disease that causes intensely itchy blisters, usually on the elbows, knees, back and buttocks. The blisters usually develop in patches of the same shape and size on both sides of the body.
* Chronic bullous dermatosis: a disease that causes clusters of blisters on the face, mouth or genitals.
* Cutaneous radiation syndrome
* Epidermolysis bullosa: a genetic disorder that results in a detachment in the skin layers, resulting in easy bruising.

==Pathophysiology==

===Friction blisters===
Friction blisters are caused by excess shear stress between the bottom and surface of the skin and the body. The strata of skin around the stratum spinosum are most susceptible to shear. As the stratum spinosum tears away from the connecting tissues below, plasma from the cells diffuses out. This plasma solution helps new cells divide and grow into new connective tissues and epidermal layers.

The clear fluid will be reabsorbed as new cells develop and the swollen appearance will subside. Painful blisters located on hands (palmar surface) and feet (plantar surface) are due to tissue shearing deeper in the epidermis, near nerve endings. Lower tissues are more susceptible to infection.

==Prevention==

===Friction blisters===
Friction blisters, caused by rubbing against the skin, can be prevented by reducing the friction to a level where blisters will not form. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways.

Blisters on the feet can be prevented by wearing comfortable, well-fitting shoes and clean socks. Inherently ill-fitting or stiffer shoes, such as high heels and dress shoes, present a larger risk of blistering. Blisters are more likely to develop on skin that is moist, so socks that manage moisture or frequent sock changes will aid those with particularly sweaty feet. While exercising or playing sports, special sports socks can help keep feet drier and reduce the chance of blisters. Before going for a long walk, it is also important to ensure that shoes or hiking boots have been properly broken in.

Even before a &quot;hot&quot; or irritated area on the foot is felt, taping a protective layer of padding or a friction-reducing interface between the affected area and the footwear can prevent the formation of a blister. Bandages, moleskin and tapes generally must be applied to the foot daily, and most have a very high coefficient of friction (COF), but a friction-management patch applied to the shoe will remain in place much longer, throughout many changes of socks and insoles. This type of intervention may be used with footwear that is worn daily, with specialty shoes and boots like hockey skates, ice skates, inline skates, ski boots and cleats, or even with orthotic braces and splints. For periods of sustained use such as hiking and trail running, especially where water ingress or moisture build up in the shoe or boot can occur, moisture wicking liner socks can provide the required friction protection.

To avoid friction blisters on the hands, gloves should be worn when using tools such as a shovel or pickaxe, doing manual work such as gardening, or using sports equipment like golf clubs or baseball bats. Oars used for competitive rowing are known for causing frequent blisters on the hands of oarsmen. Weightlifters are also prone to blisters as are gymnasts from the friction developed by the rubbing against the bars. To further reduce the occurrence one can tape the hands, and there are also a number of products on the market that claim to reduce the occurrence of blisters. These are all intended to be worn as a liner underneath a glove. The majority of these offerings simply add padding, and create a layer that reduces the coefficient of friction between the skin and the glove.

A lubricant, typically talcum powder, can be used to reduce friction between skin and apparel in the short term. People put talcum powder inside gloves or shoes for this purpose, although this type of lubricant can actually increase the friction in the long term as it absorbs moisture. Increased friction makes blisters more likely.

===Other===
Sunscreen and protective clothing should also be used during the hottest part of the day to avoid blisters from sunburn. Avoiding sunlight during midday is the best way to avoid blisters from sunburn. Protective gloves should be worn when handling detergents, cleaning products, solvents and other chemicals.

<text>Andrew Pickens (September 13, 1739August 11, 1817) was a militia leader in the American Revolution. A planter and slaveowner, he developed his Hopewell plantation on the east side of the Keowee River across from the Cherokee town of &quot;Isunigu&quot; (Seneca) in western South Carolina. He was elected as a member of the United States House of Representatives from western South Carolina. Several treaties with the Cherokee were negotiated and signed at his plantation of Hopewell.

==Early life==
Pickens was born in 1739 in Bucks County in the Province of Pennsylvania. He was the son of Scots-Irish immigrants, Presbyterians of primarily Scottish ancestry from Carrickfergus in County Antrim, Ireland (in what is today Northern Ireland.) His parents were Andrew Pickens Sr. and Anne (&quot;née&quot; Davis). But his paternal great-grandparents were ethnic French Huguenots: Robert Andrew Pickens (Robert André Picon) had migrated to England and Northern Ireland; his wife Esther-Jeanne, widow Bonneau, was from La Rochelle, France and had settled in South Carolina along with other Huguenot refugees fleeing religious persecution as Protestants.

His family traveled the Great Wagon Road in the Shenandoah Valley in hopes of finding a new home. Records show they first settled in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. In 1752, his family moved to the Waxhaws on the South Carolina frontier.

==Move to frontier South Carolina==
Pickens sold his farm there in 1764 and bought land in Abbeville County, South Carolina, near the Georgia border. He married Rebecca Calhoun there and they started a family. In addition to meeting other ethnic Scots-Irish and new immigrants to the area, he became acquainted with his Cherokee neighbors. He built a blockhouse as a base for training.

He established the Hopewell Plantation on the east side of the Keowee River. Several treaty negotiating sessions were held here with the Cherokee. Each resulted in a &quot;Treaty of Hopewell&quot;. Just across the river was the Cherokee town of &quot;Isunigu&quot;, also known as &quot;Seneca&quot;.

A religious man, Pickens was known as the &quot;Fighting Elder&quot; because of his strong Presbyterian faith.
==Military career==
Pickens served in the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1760–1761. When the Revolutionary War started, he sided with the rebel militia and was made a captain. He rose to the rank of brigadier general in the South Carolina militia during the war.

He emerged as a military leader in Long Cane, fighting against the Cherokee who had allied with the Loyalists. In the year 1779 Henry Clinton deployed British soldiers to both South Carolina and North Carolina to encourage Loyalist support. On February 14, 1779, Colonel Pickens and his 300-man militia overtook the larger British force of 700–800 men under Colonel Boyd at the Battle of Kettle Creek in Wilkes County, Georgia, just south of the Long Canes. His victory at Kettle Creek slowed the recruitment of the Loyalists. However, when the British defeated the Southern Continental Army in 1780 in the Siege of Charleston, Pickens surrendered a fort in the Ninety-Six District. He, along with his 300 militia men, on parole oath, agreed to sit out the war.
Pickens&#x27;s parole did not last, however. After Tory raiders destroyed most of his property and frightened his family, he informed the British that they had violated the terms of parole. He rejoined the war. During this period, Pickens joined Francis Marion (known as the Swamp Fox) and Thomas Sumter as the most well-known partisan leaders in the Carolinas. Sumter also resumed fighting under similar circumstances. He saw action at the Battle of Cowpens, Siege of Augusta, Siege of Ninety-Six, and the Battle of Eutaw Springs.Pickens also led a campaign in north Georgia against the Cherokee late in the war; they had allied with the British in an effort to expel European Americans from their territory. His victorious campaign resulted in the Cherokee ceding significant portions of land between the Savannah and Chattahoochee rivers in the Long Swamp Treaty, signed in what is currently Pickens County, Georgia. Pickens led a detached militia of 25 men to battle against a Cherokee force of an estimated 150 men in what came to be called the &quot;Ring Fight.&quot; Pickens gained the respect of these Natives. After the war, he was well-regarded by Native Americans that he dealt with; he was given the name &quot;Skyagunsta&quot;, &quot;The Wizard Owl,&quot; which is reportedly a name based on a well-regarded previous chief of the Cherokee.

*Cowpens, South Carolina: January 17, 1781:
:At the Battle of Cowpens, Brig. General Daniel Morgan gave Pickens command of the militia, which played a pivotal role in the battle. On the evening of January 16, Morgan personally instructed the militia to hold its ground and then retreat. On the morning of January 17, Pickens and the militia carried out the plan perfectly. The militia fired two rounds before retreating, something not done in previous battles and untypical of a militia. After the second round, they led Lt. Colonel Banastre Tarleton and the British to blindly charge, drawing them into a double envelopment where they were soundly defeated. This battle proved to be a turning point in the war in the South, and following Cowpens, South Carolina Governor John Rutledge promoted Pickens to brigadier general. He was also awarded a sword by Congress.

*February to March 1781:
:After the death of Brig. Gen. (Pro Tempore) William Lee Davidson on February 1, 1781, the colonels of the Salisbury District Brigade of North Carolina &quot;elected&quot; Pickens to lead them since he was a recently appointed brigadier general in South Carolina with no men to lead. He was active in February and very early March only.

*Augusta, Georgia: May 22 – June 5, 1781:
:Pickens&#x27;s militia was soon recalled to defend their own homes, and so he missed the Battle of Guilford Courthouse on March 15, 1781. In April, he raised a regiment of state regulars. In May 1781, Maj. General Nathanael Greene sent Pickens and Lt. Colonel Henry Lee to support Elijah Clarke in operations against Augusta, Georgia. The siege began on May 22 and, after maneuvering, securing outposts and the cutting off of reinforcements by the Patriots, Colonel Thomas Brown surrendered Augusta on June 5, 1781.

*Ninety Six, South Carolina: May 22 – June 19, 1781:
:Following the surrender of Augusta, Pickens and Lt. Colonel Lee joined General Greene in his siege at Ninety Six, South Carolina. Greene had begun his siege on May 22, 1781, the same day that Augusta had been besieged. On June 11, Greene ordered Pickens and Lt. Colonel William Washington to aid Thomas Sumter in blocking a relief column led by Lord Rawdon. However, Sumter instead moved to Fort Granby, South Carolina, allowing Rawdon to make his way to Ninety Six. On June 19, Greene had to give up the siege and retreat after a failed assault.

*Eutaw Springs, Charleston, South Carolina: September 8, 1781:
: Under the command of General Nathanael Greene, Pickens led his militia in one of the final major battles in the South. With the aid of Henry Lee and Francis Marion, the Patriots fought the British at the Battle of Eutaw Springs. Although more Patriots died than Loyalists and British, the efforts made by the Patriots forced the British to lose control of the South for the rest of the war.
==Political career==
At the end of the war, Pickens was elected to public office in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1781 to 1794. He was a South Carolina delegate to the Constitutional Convention. Pickens was later elected to the Third Congress, served from 1793 to 1795 as an Anti-Administration member, opposing the policies of US Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. He was one of nine representatives, and the only representative of the Anti-Administration party, to vote against the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.

==Family==
Pickens married Rebecca Floride Calhoun in 1765. They had 12 children: Mary Pickens (1766–1836); Ezekiel Pickens (1768–1813), Ann Pickens (1770–1846), son (1772), Jane Pickens (1773–1816); Margaret Pickens (1777–1830); Andrew Pickens, Jr. (1779–1838), son (1782); Rebecca Pickens (1784–1831); Catherine Pickens (1786–1871) and Joseph Pickens (1791–1853). Ezekiel Pickens was elected as lieutenant governor of South Carolina, serving from 1802 to 1804. His younger brother Andrew Pickens, Jr. also went into politics; he was elected as governor of South Carolina, serving 1817–1819. A grandson was Francis Wilkinson Pickens, who was also elected as governor of South Carolina, serving from 1860 to 1862. 
Pickens died near Tamassee, South Carolina, in Oconee County, on August 11, 1817. He is buried at Old Stone Church Cemetery in Clemson, South Carolina.

Pickens was an uncle (through his marriage to Rebecca Florida Calhoun) to John C. Calhoun (1782–1850), who was a leading American politician and political theorist from South Carolina during the first half of the 19th century. Calhoun&#x27;s home, Fort Hill, is now located on the campus of Clemson University in Pickens County, South Carolina. It is a noted historic landmark in the state of South Carolina.

==Legacy and memorials==
Fort Pickens in Florida is named in his honor. Also named after him are Pickens County in Alabama; Georgia; and South Carolina. There is also a city of Pickens, South Carolina. He is the namesake of Pickens High School.
His Hopewell plantation is now owned and maintained by Clemson University.

Pickens was a 7th great-grandfather of former US senator and 2004 presidential candidate John Edwards.

Pickens and his actions served as one of the models for the fictional character of Benjamin Martin in &quot;The Patriot&quot;, a motion picture released in 2000. In a scene prior to the Battle of Cowpens, Benjamin Martin (character) asks the militia for two rounds before they retreat, reminiscent of Daniel Morgan in the Battle of Cowpens.

<doc id="241607" wikidata="Q15098051" url="?curid=241607" title="Bandicoot">
<text>Bandicoots are a group of more than 20 species of small to medium sized, terrestrial, largely nocturnal marsupial omnivores in the order Peramelemorphia. They are endemic to the Australia–New Guinea region, including the Bismarck Archipelago to the east and Seram and Halmahera to the west.

== Etymology ==
The bandicoot is a member of the order Peramelemorphia, and the word &quot;bandicoot&quot; is often used informally to refer to any peramelemorph, such as the bilby. The term originally referred to the unrelated Indian bandicoot rat from the Telugu word &quot;pandikokku&quot; (పందికొక్కు) wherein &quot;pandi&quot; means pig and &quot;kokku&quot; means rat. 

== Characteristics ==
Bandicoots have V-shaped faces, ending with their prominent noses similar to proboscis. These noses make them, along with bilbies, similar in appearance to elephant shrews and extinct leptictids, and they are distantly related to both mammal groups. With their well-attuned snouts and sharp claws, bandicoot are fossorial diggers. They have small but fine teeth that allow them to easily chew their food.

Like most marsupials, male bandicoots have bifurcated penises.

The embryos of bandicoots have a chorioallantoic placenta that connects them to the uterine wall, in addition to the choriovitelline placenta that is common to all marsupials. However, the chorioallantoic placenta is small compared to those of the Placentalia, and lacks chorionic villi.

Bandicoots can reach in length, and in weight. A bandicoot has a long, pointed snout, large ears, a short body, and a long tail. Its body is covered with fur that can be brown, black, golden, white, or grey in colour. Bandicoots have strong hind legs well adapted for jumping.

Bandicoots also have low body temperatures and low basal metabolic rates which aides their survival in hot and dry climates. They also have low total water evaporative rate and effective panting mechanisms which further aid their survival in hotter temperatures. 
== Classification ==
Classification within the Peramelemorphia was previously thought to be straightforward, with two families in the order—the short-legged and mostly herbivorous bandicoots, and the longer-legged, nearly carnivorous bilbies. In recent years, however, the situation clearly has become more complex. First, the bandicoots of the New Guinean and far-northern Australian rainforests were deemed distinct from all other bandicoots and were grouped together in the separate family Peroryctidae. More recently, the bandicoot families were reunited in the Peramelidae, with the New Guinean species split into four genera in two subfamilies, Peroryctinae and Echymiperinae, while the &quot;true bandicoots&quot; occupy the subfamily Peramelinae. The only exception is the now-extinct pig-footed bandicoot, which has been given its own family, Chaeropodidae.

==Vernacular names==
The name bandicoot is an Anglicised version of a word from the Telugu language of South India which translates as &#x27;pig-rat&#x27;. What are now called bandicoots are not found in India and bandicoot was originally applied to completely unrelated mammals—several species of large rats (rodents). Today, these species, belonging to the genera &quot;Bandicota&quot; and &quot;Nesokia&quot;, are referred to as bandicoot rats. 

Robert Blust reconstructs the form *mansar or *mansər &#x27;bandicoot&#x27; for Proto-Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian (i.e., the reconstructed most recent common ancestor of the Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages) from related words like Oceanic Motu and Fijian , but the validity of this reconstruction is doubted by Schapper (2011). It is known as aine in the Abinomn language of Papua, Indonesia.

Bandicoots have different names by the indigenous peoples of the Australia-New Guinea region. For example, the Kaurna people refer to the southern brown bandicoot as the &quot;bung&quot; or the &quot;marti&quot;.

<doc id="241610" wikidata="Q156622" url="?curid=241610" title="Giorgio de Chirico">
<text>Giuseppe Maria Alberto Giorgio de Chirico ( ; ; 10 July 1888 – 20 November 1978) was an Italian artist and writer born in Greece. In the years before World War I, he founded the art movement, which profoundly influenced the surrealists. His best-known works often feature Roman arcades, long shadows, mannequins, trains, and illogical perspective. His imagery reflects his affinity for the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer and of Friedrich Nietzsche, and for the mythology of his birthplace.

After 1919, he became a critic of modern art, studied traditional painting techniques, and later worked in a neoclassical or neo-Baroque style, while frequently revisiting the metaphysical themes of his earlier work. In 2018 it was suggested that de Chirico may have suffered from Alice in Wonderland syndrome.

==Life and works==
Giuseppe Maria Alberto Giorgio de Chirico was born in Volos, Greece, as the eldest son of Gemma Cervetto and Evaristo de Chirico. His mother was a Genoese baroness of Greek origins from Smyrna, and his father a Sicilian &quot;barone&quot; of Greek ancestry (the Kyriko or Chirico family was of Greek origin, having moved from Rhodes to Palermo in 1523 together with 4,000 other Greek Catholic families). De Chirico&#x27;s family was in Greece at the time of his birth because his father, an engineer, was in charge of the construction of a railroad. His younger brother, Andrea Francesco Alberto, became a famous writer, painter and composer under the pseudonym Alberto Savinio. 

Beginning in 1900, de Chirico studied drawing and painting at Athens Polytechnic — mainly under the guidance of the Greek painters Georgios Roilos and Georgios Jakobides. After Evaristo de Chirico&#x27;s death in 1905, the family relocated in 1906 to Germany, after first visiting Florence. De Chirico entered the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, where he studied under Gabriel von Hackl and Carl von Marr and read the writings of the philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Schopenhauer and Otto Weininger. There, he also studied the works of Arnold Böcklin and Max Klinger. The style of his earliest paintings, such as &quot;The Dying Centaur&quot; (1909), shows the influence of Böcklin.

===Metaphysical art===

De Chirico returned to Italy in the summer of 1909 and spent six months in Milan. By 1910, he was beginning to paint in a simpler style with flat, anonymous surfaces. At the beginning of 1910, he moved to Florence where he painted the first of his &#x27;Metaphysical Town Square&#x27; series, &quot;The Enigma of an Autumn Afternoon&quot;, after the revelation he felt in Piazza Santa Croce. He also painted &quot;The Enigma of the Oracle&quot; while in Florence. In July 1911 he spent a few days in Turin on his way to Paris. De Chirico was profoundly moved by what he called the &#x27;metaphysical aspect&#x27; of Turin, especially the architecture of its archways and piazzas.

The paintings de Chirico produced between 1909 and 1919, his metaphysical period, are characterized by haunted, brooding moods evoked by their images. At the start of this period, his subjects were motionless cityscapes inspired by the bright daylight of Mediterranean cities, but gradually he turned his attention to studies of cluttered storerooms, sometimes inhabited by mannequin-like hybrid figures.

De Chirico&#x27;s conception of Metaphysical art was strongly influenced by his reading of Nietzsche, whose style of writing fascinated de Chirico with its suggestions of unseen auguries beneath the appearance of things. De Chirico found inspiration in the unexpected sensations that familiar places or things sometimes produced in him: In a manuscript of 1909 he wrote of the &quot;host of strange, unknown and solitary things that can be translated into painting ... What is required above all is a pronounced sensitivity.&quot; Metaphysical art combined everyday reality with mythology, and evoked inexplicable moods of nostalgia, tense expectation, and estrangement. The picture space often featured illogical, contradictory, and drastically receding perspectives. Among de Chirico&#x27;s most frequent motifs were arcades, of which he wrote: &quot;The Roman arcade is fate ... its voice speaks in riddles which are filled with a peculiarly Roman poetry&quot;.

De Chirico moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea. Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade, a member of the jury at the Salon d&#x27;Automne, where he exhibited three of his works: &quot;Enigma of the Oracle&quot;, &quot;Enigma of an Afternoon&quot; and &quot;Self-Portrait&quot;. During 1913 he exhibited paintings at the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d&#x27;Automne; his work was noticed by Pablo Picasso and Guillaume Apollinaire, and he sold his first painting, &quot;The Red Tower&quot;. His time in Paris also resulted in the production of de Chirico&#x27;s &quot;Ariadne&quot;. In 1914, through Apollinaire, he met the art dealer Paul Guillaume, with whom he signed a contract for his artistic output.

At the outbreak of World War I, he returned to Italy. Upon his arrival in May 1915, he enlisted in the army, but he was considered unfit for work and assigned to the hospital at Ferrara. The shop windows of that town inspired a series of paintings that feature biscuits, maps, and geometric constructions in indoor settings. In Ferrara he met with Carlo Carrà and together they founded the pittura metafisica movement. He continued to paint, and in 1918, he transferred to Rome. Starting from 1918, his work was exhibited extensively in Europe.

===Return to order===
In November 1919, de Chirico published an article in &quot;Valori plastici&quot; entitled &quot;The Return of Craftsmanship&quot;, in which he advocated a return to traditional methods and iconography. This article heralded an abrupt change in his artistic orientation, as he adopted a classicizing manner inspired by such old masters as Raphael and Signorelli, and became part of the post-war return to order in the arts. He became an outspoken opponent of modern art.

In the early 1920s, the Surrealist writer André Breton discovered one of de Chirico&#x27;s metaphysical paintings on display in Guillaume&#x27;s Paris gallery, and was enthralled. Numerous young artists who were similarly affected by de Chirico&#x27;s imagery became the core of the Paris Surrealist group centered around Breton. In 1924 de Chirico visited Paris and was accepted into the group, although the surrealists were severely critical of his post-metaphysical work.

De Chirico met and married his first wife, the Russian ballerina Raissa Gurievich (1894-1979) in 1925, and together they moved to Paris. His relationship with the Surrealists grew increasingly contentious, as they publicly disparaged his new work; by 1926 he had come to regard them as &quot;cretinous and hostile&quot;. They soon parted ways in acrimony. In 1928 he held his first exhibition in New York City and shortly afterwards, London. He wrote essays on art and other subjects, and in 1929 published a novel entitled &quot;Hebdomeros, the Metaphysician&quot;. Also in 1929, he made stage designs for Sergei Diaghilev.
===Later work===
In 1930, de Chirico met his second wife, Isabella Pakszwer Far (1909–1990), a Russian, with whom he would remain for the rest of his life. Together they moved to Italy in 1932 and to the US in 1936, finally settling in Rome in 1944. In 1948 he bought a house near the Spanish Steps; now the Giorgio de Chirico House Museum, a museum dedicated to his work.

In 1939, he adopted a neo-Baroque style influenced by Rubens.
This artistic phase, which lasted until the late 60s, is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;Baroque season&#x27;. During this time, de Chirico draws inspiration from artists such as Tintoretto, Dürer, Raphael, Delacroix and Renoir. The artist, far from willing to achieve realism in his paintings, strives to create images charged with myths and visions, for an art that is still literally &quot;metaphysical&quot;, beyond reality. During these years, De Chirico also studied and rediscovered the painting techniques adopted by old masters, such as Titian: &quot;So I started doing copies of the old masters. In Rome... in Florence... and then I also got interested in their techniques, I consulted numerous treatises on painting, both ancient and modern.&quot;

De Chirico&#x27;s later paintings never received the same critical praise as did those from his metaphysical period. He resented this, as he thought his later work was better and more mature. He nevertheless produced backdated &quot;self-forgeries&quot; both to profit from his earlier success, and as an act of revenge—retribution for the critical preference for his early work. He also denounced many paintings attributed to him in public and private collections as forgeries. In 1945, he published his memoirs.

He remained extremely prolific even as he approached his 90th year. During the 1960s, Massimiliano Fuksas worked in his atelier. In 1974 de Chirico was elected to the French Académie des Beaux-Arts. He died in Rome on 20 November 1978. In 1992 his remains were moved to the Roman church of San Francesco a Ripa.

==Style==
De Chirico&#x27;s best-known works are the paintings of his metaphysical period. In them he developed a repertoire of motifs—empty arcades, towers, elongated shadows, mannequins, and trains among others—that he arranged to create &quot;images of forlornness and emptiness&quot; that paradoxically also convey a feeling of &quot;power and freedom&quot;. According to Sanford Schwartz, de Chirico—whose father was a railroad engineer—painted images that suggest &quot;the way you take in buildings and vistas from the perspective of a train window. His towers, walls, and plazas seem to flash by, and you are made to feel the power that comes from seeing things that way: you feel you know them more intimately than the people do who live with them day by day.&quot;

In 1982, Robert Hughes wrote that de Chirico
In this, he resembles his more representational American contemporary, Edward Hopper: their pictures&#x27; low sunlight, their deep and often irrational shadows, their empty walkways and portentous silences creating an enigmatic visual poetry.

==Legacy==

De Chirico won praise for his work almost immediately from the writer Guillaume Apollinaire, who helped to introduce his work to the later Surrealists. De Chirico strongly influenced the Surrealist movement: Yves Tanguy wrote how one day in 1922 he saw one of de Chirico&#x27;s paintings in an art dealer&#x27;s window, and was so impressed by it he resolved on the spot to become an artist—although he had never even held a brush. Other Surrealists who acknowledged de Chirico&#x27;s influence include Max Ernst, Salvador Dalí, and René Magritte, who described his first sighting of de Chirico&#x27;s &quot;The Song of Love&quot; as &quot;one of the most moving moments of my life: my eyes &quot;saw&quot; thought for the first time.&quot; Other artists as diverse as Giorgio Morandi, Carlo Carrà, Paul Delvaux, Carel Willink, Harue Koga, Philip Guston, Andy Warhol and Mark Kostabi were influenced by de Chirico.

De Chirico&#x27;s style has influenced several filmmakers, particularly in the 1950s through 1970s. The visual style of the French animated film &quot;Le Roi et l&#x27;oiseau&quot;, by Paul Grimault and Jacques Prévert, was influenced by de Chirico&#x27;s work, primarily via Tanguy, a friend of Prévert. The visual style of Valerio Zurlini&#x27;s film &quot;The Desert of the Tartars&quot; (1976) was influenced by de Chirico&#x27;s work. Michelangelo Antonioni, the Italian film director, also said he was influenced by de Chirico. Some comparison can be made to the long takes in Antonioni&#x27;s films from the 1960s, in which the camera continues to linger on desolate cityscapes populated by a few distant figures, or none at all, in the absence of the film&#x27;s protagonists.

In 1958, Riverside Records used a reproduction of de Chirico&#x27;s 1915 painting &quot;The Seer&quot; (originally painted as a tribute to French poet Arthur Rimbaud) as the cover art for pianist Thelonious Monk&#x27;s live album &quot;Misterioso&quot;. The choice was made to capitalize on Monk&#x27;s popularity with intellectual and bohemian fans from venues such as the Five Spot Café, where the album had been recorded, but Monk biographer Robin Kelley later observed deeper connections between the painting and the pianist&#x27;s music; Rimbaud had &quot;called on the artist to be a seer in order to plumb the depths of the unconscious in the quest for clairvoyance ... The one-eyed figure represented the visionary. The architectural forms and the placement of the chalkboard evoked the unity of art and science—a perfect symbol for an artist whose music has been called &#x27;mathematical.&#x27;&quot;

Writers who have appreciated de Chirico include John Ashbery, who has called &quot;Hebdomeros&quot; &quot;probably ... the finest [major work of Surrealist fiction].&quot; Several of Sylvia Plath&#x27;s poems are influenced by de Chirico. In his book &quot;Blizzard of One&quot; Mark Strand included a poetic diptych called &quot;Two de Chiricos&quot;: &quot;The Philosopher&#x27;s Conquest&quot; and &quot;The Disquieting Muses&quot;.

Gabriele Tinti composed three poems inspired by de Chirico&#x27;s paintings: &quot;The Nostalgia of the Poet&quot; (1914), &quot;The Uncertainty of the Poet&quot; (1913), and &quot;Ariadne&quot; (1913), works in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, the Tate, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, respectively. The poems were read by actor Burt Young at the Met in 2016.

The box art for Fumito Ueda&#x27;s PlayStation 2 game &quot;Ico&quot; sold in Japan and Europe was strongly influenced by de Chirico.

The cover art of New Order&#x27;s single &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; is based on de Chirico&#x27;s painting &quot;The Evil Genius of a King&quot;.

The music video for the David Bowie song &quot;Loving the Alien&quot; was partly influenced by de Chirico. Bowie was an admirer of his genderless tailors&#x27; dummies.

A 2018 study by researchers from the Magna Græcia University, published in &quot;Frontiers in Neurology&quot;, suggested that de Chirico suffered from Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS), a neurological disorder affecting a person&#x27;s perception, leading the individual to perceive the sizes of some parts of their body and other objects, in an unreal way, like Alice in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s novel.

<text>The blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops persicus) is a near passerine bird in the bee-eater family, Meropidae. The genus name &quot;Merops&quot; is Ancient Greek for &quot;bee-eater&quot;, and &quot;persicus&quot; is Latin for &quot;Persian&quot;.

It breeds in Northern Africa, and the Middle East from eastern Turkey to Kazakhstan and India. It is generally strongly migratory, wintering in tropical Africa, although some populations breed and live year-round in the Sahel. This species occurs as a rare vagrant north of its breeding range, with most vagrants occurring in Italy and Greece. Recently (2024) also recorded in Sri Lanka for the first time.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Two subspecies are recognized:

*&quot;Merops persicus persicus&quot; - Breeds in Asia, winters in East and Southern Africa.
*&quot;Merops persicus chrysocercus&quot; - Breeds in North Africa, winters in West Africa.

This species is closely related to blue-tailed bee-eater, &quot;M. philippinus&quot; of East Asia, and the olive bee-eater of Africa, and has been treated as being the same species (conspecific).

==Description==
This species, like other bee-eaters, is a richly coloured, slender bird. It is predominantly green; its face has blue sides with a black eye stripe, and a yellow and brown throat; the beak is black. It can reach a length of , with the two elongated central tail feathers adding another . Sexes are mostly alike but the tail-streamers of the female are shorter.

This is a bird which breeds in sub-tropical semi-desert with a few trees, such as acacia. It winters in open woodland or grassland. As the name suggests, bee-eaters predominantly eat insects, especially bees, wasps and hornets, which are caught in the air by sorties from an open perch. However, this species probably takes more dragonflies than any other food item. Its preferred hunting perch is telephone wires if available.

Blue-cheeked bee-eaters may nest solitarily or in loose colonies of up to ten birds. They may also nest in colonies with European bee-eaters. The nests are located in sandy banks, embankments, low cliffs or on the shore of the Caspian Sea. They make a relatively long tunnel of in length in which the four to eight (usually six or seven), spherical white eggs are laid. Both the male and the female take care of the eggs, although the female alone incubates them at night. Incubation takes 23–26 days.

The call sounds &#x27;flatter&#x27; and less &#x27;fluty&#x27; than the European bee-eater.

<text>Black magic or dark magic traditionally refers to the use of magic or supernatural powers for evil and selfish purposes. 

The links and interaction between black magic and religion are many and varied. Beyond black magic&#x27;s historical persecution by Christianity and its inquisitions, there are links between religious and black magic rituals. For example, 17th-century priest Étienne Guibourg is said to have performed a series of Black Mass rituals with alleged witch Catherine Monvoisin for Madame de Montespan. During his period of scholarship, A. E. Waite provided a comprehensive account of black magic practices, rituals and traditions in &quot;The Book of Ceremonial Magic&quot; (1911).

The influence of popular culture has allowed other practices to be drawn in under the broad banner of black magic, including the concept of Satanism. While the invocation of demons or spirits is an accepted part of black magic, this practice is distinct from the worship or deification of such spiritual beings. The two are usually combined in medieval beliefs about witchcraft.

== Etymology ==
The first known appearance of &quot;black magic&quot; in English is Edmund Spenser&#x27;s epic poem &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, where he anglicizes the contemporary term &quot;nigromancy&quot;, derived from Latin &quot;nigromantia,&quot; a medieval variant of &quot;necromantia&quot; &quot;necromancy&quot; influenced by Latin &quot;niger&quot; &quot;black&quot;.

== History ==

Robert M. Place&#x27;s 2009 book, &quot;Magic and Alchemy&quot; describes the origins of black magic as being like its counterpart white magic: traced to the primitive, ritualistic worship of spirits. Unlike white magic, in which Place sees parallels with primitive shamanistic efforts to achieve closeness with spiritual beings, the rituals that developed into modern black magic were designed to evoke those same spirits to produce beneficial outcomes for the practitioner. Place also provides a broad modern definition of both black and white magic, preferring instead to refer to them as &quot;high magic&quot; (white) and &quot;low magic&quot; (black) based primarily on intentions of the practitioner employing them. He acknowledges, though, that this broader definition (of &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot;) suffers from prejudices because good-intentioned folk magic may be considered &quot;low&quot; while ceremonial magic involving expensive or exclusive components may be considered by some as &quot;high magic&quot;, regardless of intent.

During the Renaissance, many magical practices and rituals were considered evil or irreligious and by extension, black magic in the broad sense. Witchcraft and non-mainstream esoteric study were prohibited and targeted by the Inquisition. As a result, natural magic developed as a way for thinkers and intellectuals, like Marsilio Ficino, abbot Johannes Trithemius and Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, to advance esoteric and ritualistic study (though still often in secret) without significant persecution.

While &quot;natural magic&quot; became popular among the educated and upper classes of the 16th and 17th century, ritualistic magic and folk magic remained subject to persecution. Twentieth-century writer Montague Summers generally rejects the definitions of &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; magic as &quot;contradictory&quot;, though he highlights the extent to which magic in general, regardless of intent, was considered &quot;black&quot; and cites William Perkins posthumous 1608 instructions in that regard:

In particular, though, the term was most commonly reserved for those accused of invoking demons and other evil spirits, those hexing or cursing their neighbours, those using magic to destroy crops, and those capable of leaving their earthly bodies and travelling great distances in spirit (to which the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; &quot;devotes one long and important chapter&quot;), usually to engage in devil-worship. Summers also highlights the etymological development of the term &quot;nigromancer&quot;, in common use from 1200 to approximately 1500, (, black; , divination), broadly &quot;one skilled in the black arts&quot;.

In a modern context, the line between white magic and black magic is somewhat clearer and most modern definitions focus on intent rather than practice. There is also an extent to which many modern Wicca and witchcraft practitioners have sought to distance themselves from those intent on practising black magic. Those who seek to do harm or evil are less likely to be accepted into mainstream Wiccan circles or covens in an era where benevolent magic is increasingly associated with new-age beliefs and practices, and self-help spiritualism.

==&quot;Artes prohibitae&quot; and &quot;artes magicae&quot;==

Seven &quot;artes prohibitae&quot; or &quot;artes magicae&quot; were arts prohibited by canon law as expounded by Johannes Hartlieb in 1456. Their sevenfold partition reflecting that of the artes liberales and artes mechanicae. While the term nigromancy broadly construed includes the six associated divinatory practices, it more specifically refers to the demonic magic of the Late Middle Ages. Demonic magic was performed in groups surrounding a leader in possession of a grimoire. Practitioners were typically members of the educated elite, as most grimoires were written in Latin. One such case in 1444, Inquisitor Gaspare Sighicelli took action against a group active in Bologna. Marco Mattei of Gesso and friar Jacopo of Viterbo confessed to taking part in magical practices. Nigromancy may include, but is not a synonym for, necromancy (&quot;death magic&quot;).

==Voodoo==

Voodoo has been associated with modern black magic; drawn together in popular culture and fiction. However, while hexing or cursing may be accepted black magic practices, Voodoo has its own distinct history and traditions.

Voodoo tradition makes its own distinction between black and white magic, with sorcerers like the Bokor known for using magic and rituals of both. But practitioners&#x27; penchant for magic associated with curses, poisons and zombies means they, and Voodoo in general, are regularly associated with black magic.

== Modern accusations ==

In the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian state media accused Ukraine of using black magic to fend off the Russian military, specifically accusing Oleksiy Arestovych of enlisting sorcerers and witches as Ukrainian soldiers who were consecrating &quot;weapons with blood magick&quot;.

<doc id="241627" wikidata="Q31884" url="?curid=241627" title="Blue-tailed bee-eater">
<text>The blue-tailed bee-eater (Merops philippinus) is a near passerine bird in the bee-eater family Meropidae. It is widely distributed across South and Southeast Asia where many populations are strongly migratory, and seen seasonally in many parts but breeding colonially in small areas across their range, mostly in river valleys, where they nest by tunneling into loamy sand banks. They are seen mostly in open habitats close to water.

== Description ==
This species, like other bee-eaters, is a richly coloured, slender bird. It is predominantly green; its face has a narrow blue patch with a black eye stripe, and a yellow and brown throat; the tail is blue and the beak is black. The three outer toes are united around their bases. It can reach a length of 23–26 cm, including the two elongated central tail feathers which can be just two inches more than the remaining ten feathers. Sexes are alike. This species is usually found near water and like other bee-eaters it predominantly eats flying insects, especially bees (as large as the &quot;Xylocopa&quot; sp.), wasps and hornets, which are caught in the air by sorties from an open perch. They may also forage in flight over estuaries, backwaters and even over the sea but not far from the coast. This species probably takes bees and dragonflies in roughly equal numbers. The insects that are caught are beaten on the perch to kill them and break the exoskeleton. This habit is seen in many other members of the order Coraciiformes. They call mainly in flight with a rolling chirping whistling &quot;&quot;.

The only confusable species within its range is the blue-cheeked bee-eater which however tends to be found in drier areas. The blue-tailed differs in having the rump and tail blue rather than green and black. The undertail feathers are bluish rather than green in the blue-cheeked. The blue cheek patch is much smaller while the chestnut on the throat and breast darker and covering a larger area.

They breed in April to May in India nesting colonially with closely placed nest holes in a vertical mudbank or even burrowing into gently sloping land. They tend to choose sandy and sandy clay loams but avoid heavier clay loams. They also prefer clear mud banks without any vegetation cover. In Sri Lanka, they have been noted to breed in artificial sand dunes created by dredging of sea sand. The nest tunnel can run nearly 2 metres deep. About 5 to 7 near spherical eggs are laid. Both the male and the female take care of the eggs. The parents guard the nest to prevent intraspecific brood parasitism and extra pair copulation. These birds also feed and roost communally. One or two helpers may join the breeding pair after incubation begins. Although males and females appear similar to the human eye, males tend to have longer central tail feather extensions and UV reflectance studies demonstrate that healthy males had darker chestnut throats and brighter green body plumage while females showed brighter blue rumps and yellow chins.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
This species has sometimes been considered to be conspecific with the blue-cheeked bee-eater which is a close sister taxon, the two forming a clade with the Madagascan olive bee-eater. In the past the species has been treated variously as &quot;M. persicus javanicus&quot;, &quot;M. superciliosus javanicus&quot;, and &quot;M. superciliosus philippinus&quot;.

== Ecological interactions ==
Based on the presence of spores of &quot;Nosema ceranae&quot; in the droppings of blue-tailed bee-eaters, it has been suggested that they may be capable of distributing the parasite to bees across a wide geographic range. A species of feather louse, &quot;Brueelia superciliosa&quot; has been described from hosts of this species in Thailand.

== Distribution and movements ==
The species has a patchy breeding distribution across India, Myanmar, and parts of Southeast Asia. In India they are known to breed in several of the river valleys including those of the Godavari, Kaveri, Tunga Badra and Krishna rivers. They also nest in the eastern parts of Sri Lanka.

Blue-tailed bee-eaters are seasonal in many parts of their range and are known to migrate diurnally &quot;en masse&quot; at some places like Tanjung Tuan (W. Malaysia) and Promsri Hill (southern Thailand). They are winter visitors in parts of Malaysia and peninsular India. The non-breeding ranges of the blue-cheeked bee-eater and blue-tailed overlap in some parts of Gujarat and western peninsular India.

== Status ==
The Blue-tailed bee-eater is listed as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

<text>The marketing mix is the set of controllable elements or variables that a company uses to influence and meet the needs of its target customers in the most effective and efficient way possible. These variables are often grouped into four key components, often referred to as the &quot;Four Ps of Marketing.&quot;

These four P&#x27;s are:

* Product: This represents the physical or intangible offering that a company provides to its customers. It includes the design, features, quality, packaging, branding, and any additional services or warranties associated with the product.
* Price: Price refers to the amount of money customers are willing to pay for the product or service. Setting the right price is crucial, as it not only affects the company&#x27;s profitability but also influences consumer perception and purchasing decisions.
* Place (Distribution): Place involves the strategies and channels used to make the product or service accessible to the target market. It encompasses decisions related to distribution channels, retail locations, online platforms, and logistics.
* Promotion: Promotion encompasses all the activities a company undertakes to communicate the value of its product or service to the target audience. This includes advertising, sales promotions, public relations, social media marketing, and any other methods used to create awareness and generate interest in the offering. The marketing mix has been defined as the &quot;set of marketing tools that the firm uses to pursue its marketing objectives in the target market&quot;.

Marketing theory emerged in the early twenty-first century. The contemporary marketing mix which has become the dominant framework for marketing management decisions was first published in 1984. In services marketing, an extended marketing mix is used, typically comprising the 7 Ps (product, price, promotion, place, people, process, physical evidence), made up of the original 4 Ps extended by process, people and physical evidence. Occasionally service marketers will refer to 8 Ps (product, price, place, promotion, people, positioning, packaging, and performance), comprising these 7 Ps plus performance.

In the 1990s, the model of &quot;4 Cs&quot; was introduced as a more customer-driven replacement of the 4 Ps.
There are two theories based on 4 Cs: Lauterborn&#x27;s 4 Cs (&quot;consumer&quot;, &quot;cost&quot;, &quot;convenience&quot;, and &quot;communication&quot;), and Shimizu&#x27;s 4 Cs (&quot;commodity&quot;, &quot;cost&quot;, &quot;channel&quot;, and &quot;communication&quot;).

The correct arrangement of marketing mix by enterprise marketing managers plays an important role in the success of a company&#x27;s marketing:
# Develop strengths and avoid weaknesses
# Strengthen the competitiveness and adaptability of enterprises
# Ensure the internal departments of the enterprise work closely together

== Emergence and growth ==
The origins of the 4 Ps can be traced to the late 1940s. The first known mention of a mix has been attributed to a Professor of Marketing at Harvard University, James Culliton. In 1948, Culliton published an article entitled, &quot;The Management of Marketing Costs&quot; in which Culliton describes marketers as &quot;mixers of ingredients&quot;. Years later, Culliton&#x27;s colleague, Professor Neil Borden, published a retrospective article detailing the early history of the marketing mix in which he claims that he was inspired by Culliton&#x27;s idea of &quot;mixers&quot;, and credits himself with popularising the concept of the &quot;marketing mix&quot;. According to Borden&#x27;s account, he used the term, &quot;marketing mix&quot; consistently from the late 1940s. For instance, he is known to have used the term &quot;marketing mix&quot; in his presidential address given to the American Marketing Association (AMA) in 1953.

Although the idea of marketers as &quot;mixers of ingredients&quot; caught on, marketers could not reach any real consensus about what elements should be included in the mix until the 1960s. Early schemas to define mix include:

* 1961 Albert Frey defined two groups of the offering (product, brand, and price) and the method (advertising, sales promotion, personal selling, publicity, distribution channels, marketing research, strategy)
* 1962 Lazer and Kelley defined three groups of the goods mix (product, brand, and price), the distribution mix (channels and physical distribution), and the communication mix (advertising and sales).
* 1957 John Howard defined four groups of product, price, channel, and promotion

The 4 Ps, in its modern form, was first proposed in 1960 by E. Jerome McCarthy, who presented them within a managerial approach that covered analysis, consumer behavior, market research, market segmentation, and planning. Phillip Kotler popularised this approach and helped spread the 4 Ps model. McCarthy&#x27;s 4 Ps have been widely adopted by both marketing academics and practitioners.

The prospect of extending the marketing mix first took hold at the inaugural AMA conference dedicated to Services Marketing in the early 1980s, and built on earlier theoretical works pointing to many important limitations of the 4 Ps model. Taken collectively, the papers presented at that conference indicate that service marketers were thinking about a revision to the general marketing mix based on an understanding that services were fundamentally different from products, and therefore required different tools and strategies. In 1981, Booms and Bitner proposed a model of 7 Ps, comprising the original 4 Ps extended by process, people and physical evidence, as being more applicable for services marketing.

Since then, there have been a number of different proposals for a service marketing mix (with various numbers of Ps); most notably the 8 Ps, comprising the 7 Ps above, extended by &#x27;performance&#x27;.

== McCarthy&#x27;s 4 Ps ==
The original marketing mix, or 4 Ps, as originally proposed by marketers and academic Philip Kotler and E. Jerome McCarthy, provides a framework for marketing decision-making. McCarthy&#x27;s marketing mix has since become one of the most enduring and widely accepted frameworks in marketing. McCarthy&#x27;s 4 Ps has remained influential in marketing theory and practice, serving as a cornerstone for analyzing and optimizing marketing strategies in various industries.

Product refers to what the business offers for sale and may include products or services. Product decisions include the &quot;quality, features, benefits, style, design, branding, packaging, services, warranties, guarantees, life cycles, investments and returns&quot;.

Price refers to decisions surrounding &quot;list pricing, discount pricing, special offer pricing, credit payment or credit terms&quot;. Price refers to the total cost to a customer to acquire the product, and may involve both monetary and psychological costs such as the time and effort spent in acquisition. Distribution channels taken into consideration including retailer, wholesaler, Business to Business or Business to Customer .

Place is defined as the &quot;direct or indirect channels to market, geographical distribution, territorial coverage, retail outlet, market location, catalogues, inventory, logistics, and order fulfillment&quot;. Place refers either to the physical location where a business carries out business or the distribution channels used to reach markets. Place may refer to a retail outlet, but increasingly refers to virtual stores such as &quot;a mail order catalogue, a telephone call centre or a website. Example, firms that produce luxury goods like Louis Vuitton employ an intensive placement strategy by making their products available at only a few exclusive retailers. In contrast, lower priced consumer goods like toothpaste and shampoo, typically employ an extensive placement strategy by making their products available to as many different retailers as possible.&quot;

Promotion refers to &quot;the marketing communication used to make the offer known to potential customers and persuade them to investigate it further&quot;. Promotion elements include &quot;advertising, public relations, direct selling and sales promotions.&quot;

== Modified and expanded marketing mix: &quot;Seven P&#x27;s&quot; ==

By the 1980s, a number of theorists were calling for an expanded and modified framework that would be more useful to service marketers. The prospect of expanding or modifying the marketing mix for services was a core discussion topic at the inaugural AMA Conference dedicated to Services Marketing in the early 1980s, and built on earlier theoretical works pointing to many important problems and limitations of the 4 Ps model. Taken collectively, the papers presented at that conference indicate that service marketers were thinking about a revision to the general marketing mix based on an understanding that services were fundamentally different from products, and therefore required different tools and strategies. In 1981, Booms and Bitner proposed a model of 7 Ps, comprising the original 4 Ps plus &quot;people, process,&quot; and &quot;physical evidence&quot;, as being more applicable for services marketing.

People are essential in the marketing of any product or service. Personnel stand for the service. In the professional, financial, or hospitality service industry, people are not producers, but rather the products themselves. When people are the product, they impact public perception of an organization as much as any tangible consumer goods. From a marketing management perspective, it is important to ensure that employees represent the company in alignment with broader messaging strategies. This is easier to ensure when people feel as though they have been treated fairly and earn wages sufficient to support their daily lives.

Process refers to a &quot;set of activities that results in delivery of the product benefits&quot;. A process could be a sequential order of tasks that an employee undertakes as a part of their job. It can represent sequential steps taken by a number of various employees while attempting to complete a task. Some people are responsible for managing multiple processes at once. For example, a restaurant manager should monitor the performance of employees, ensuring that processes are followed. They are also expected to supervise while customers are promptly greeted, seated, fed, and led out so that the next customer can begin this process.

Physical evidence refers to the non-human elements of the service encounter, including equipment, furniture and facilities. It may also refer to the more abstract components of the environment in which the service encounter occurs including interior design, colour schemes and layout. Some aspects of physical evidence provide lasting proof that the service has occurred, such as souvenirs, mementos, invoices and other livery of artifacts. According to Booms and Bitner&#x27;s framework, the physical evidence is &quot;the service delivered and any tangible goods that facilitate the performance and communication of the service&quot;. Physical evidence is important to customers because the tangible goods are evidence that the seller has (or has not) provided what the customer was expecting.

==Lauterborn&#x27;s 4 Cs (1990)==

Robert F. Lauterborn proposed a 4 Cs classification in 1990. His classification is a more consumer-orientated version of the 4 Ps that attempts to better fit the movement from mass marketing to niche marketing:

==Shimizu&#x27;s 4 Cs: in the 7Cs Compass Model==
Koichi Shimizu, a professor at Josai University proposed a 4 Cs classification of marketing mix in 1973. Then in 1979, it was expanded to the 7Cs Compass Model. The 7Cs Compass Model is a framework of co-marketing, which is a marketing strategy where business entities collaborate closely in their marketing efforts. Also the co-creation marketing of a company and consumers are contained in the co-marketing. Co-marketing (or collaborative marketing) is a marketing practice where two companies cooperate with separate distribution channels, sometimes including profit sharing. It is frequently confused with co-promotion. Also commensal (symbiotic) marketing is a marketing on which both corporation and a corporation, a corporation and a consumer, country and a country, human and nature coexist.

The core of &quot;4Cs&quot; is the corporation itself (company and non profit organization) Other elements include competitors, organizations, and stakeholders within the corporation. The company has to think of compliance and accountability as important. The competition in the areas in which the company competes with other firms in its industry.

The &quot;7Cs Compass Model&quot; extends the &quot;4Cs&quot; classification (commodity, cost, communication, channel) with three additional classifications. The &quot;4Cs&quot; model provides a demand/customer co-creation alternative to the well-known &quot;4Ps&quot; supply side model (product, price, promotion, place) of marketing management.
*Product → Commodity
*Price → Cost
*Promotion → Communication
*Place → Channel

The compass of consumers and circumstances (environment) are:
*(C6) Consumer – (Needle of compass to consumer)
:The factors related to consumers can be explained by the first character of four directions marked on the compass model. These can be remembered by the cardinal directions, hence the name &quot;compass model&quot;:
:*N = Needs
:*S = Security: The keywords not found in other models.
:*E = Education: (consumer education)
:*W = Wants

*(C7) Circumstances – (Needle of compass to circumstances )
:In addition to the consumer, there are various uncontrollable external environmental factors encircling the companies. Here it can also be explained by the first character of the four directions marked on the compass model:
:*N = National and International (Political, legal and ethical) environment
:*S = Social and cultural
:*E = Economic
:*W = Weather: The keywords not found in other models. Consideration of extreme weather, climate change and natural disasters is necessary to make the earth sustainable.

These can also be remembered by the cardinal directions marked on a compass. The &quot;7 Cs Compass Model&quot; is a framework in co-marketing (symbiotic marketing).
It has been criticized for being little more than the &quot;4 Ps&quot; with different points of emphasis. In particular, the &quot;7 Cs&quot; inclusion of consumers in the marketing mix is criticized, since they are a &quot;target&quot; of marketing, while the other elements of the marketing mix are &quot;tactics&quot;. The 7 Cs also include numerous strategies for product development, distribution, and pricing, while assuming that consumers want two-way communications with companies.

==Digital Marketing Mix==
Digital marketing mix is fundamentally the same as Marketing Mix, which is an adaptation of Product, Price, Place and Promotion into digital marketing aspect. Digital marketing can be commonly explained as &#x27;Achieving marketing objectives through applying digital technologies&#x27;.

=== Product ===
Thanks to the interaction and connection of the Internet, product has been redefined as &quot;virtual product&quot; in the digital marketing aspect, which is regarded as the combination of tangibility and intangibility. Through the form of digital, a product can be directly sent from manufacturers to customers. For example, customers could buy music in the form of an MP3 rather than buy it in the form of a physical CD. As a result, when a company is making strategy for Internet marketing, it is necessary to understand how to vary their products in the online environment. Here are some indications of adapt the product element on the Internet.

* Modifying the core product: In this case, it particularly refers to the products that can be remodeled into digital forms including movies, music, books and other publishing etc. Take Netflix as an example. The wide use of Internet has changed its form of products from selling and renting DVDs through retail stores into selling and renting video online.
* Providing digital products: In order to gain market shares in the Internet, companies need to widen its product range. For example, a psychological counseling could offer online consultation via video calls. 
* Building the whole product: Apart from selling products online, Amazon.com also provides a paid subscription service called Amazon Prime, with which customers could enjoy free delivery and videos on Amazon.
* Conducting online research: The Internet offers a low-cost and convenient way of making marketing researches, which is helpful for companies to find out what products or services do customers prefer.

=== Price ===

Price concerns about the pricing policies or pricing models from a company. Due to the wide use of the Internet, many applications could be found in both consumer&#x27;s and producer&#x27;s perspective. From consumers&#x27; side, the Internet enables people to make a comparison to real-time prices before they make a consumption decision, which is time-saving and effort-saving for the consumers. As for the suppliers, they can adjust prices in the real-time and provide higher degree of price transparency with customers. Besides, the Internet is more likely to ease the pressure on price because online-producers do not have to put budget on renting a physical store. Hence, making new or adjusting pricing strategies is essential for the company that wants to enter the Internet market.

=== Place ===
With the application of the Internet, place is playing an increasingly important role in promoting consumption since the Internet and the physical channels become virtual. The major contribution from the Internet to the business is not only making it possible to selling products online, but also enabling companies to build relationships with customers. Furthermore, since the convenience of navigating from one site to another, place from the digital marketing perspective is always linked with promotion, which means retailers often use third-party websites such as Google search engine to guide customers to visit their websites.

=== Promotion ===
Promotion refers to selecting the target markets, locating and integrating various communication tools in the marketing mix. Unlike the traditional marketing communication tools, tools in digital marketing aim at engaging audiences by putting advertisements and content on the social media, including display ads, pay-per-click (PPC), search engine optimisation (SEO), influencers etc. When creating online marketing campaigns, Chaffey and Smith suggested that they can be separated into six groups:

* Search marketing, including search engine optimisation(SEO), pay-per-click(PPC).
* Online PR, encouraging positive comments about one&#x27;s products or services while reducing negative comments.
* Online partnerships, building relationships between third-party webs to promote products or services.
* Interactive advertising 
* Opt-in e-mail advertising
* Social media marketing, starting and participating in customer to customer, customer to company interaction through social media.

== The Internet Mix ==
The Internet Mix, was first proposed by Sidney (Sid) Peimer in a 2004 article in Bizcommunity, where he identified the Internet Mix as consisting of three elements:

* Sell (trade)
* Tell (inform)
* Dwell (entertain)

<text>Cao Cao (; ; ; 15 March 220), courtesy name Mengde, was a Chinese statesman, warlord, and poet who rose to power during the end of the Han dynasty (), ultimately taking effective control of the Han central government. He laid the foundation for the state of Cao Wei (220–265), established by his son and successor Cao Pi, who ended the Eastern Han dynasty and inaugurated the Three Kingdoms period (220–280). Beginning in his own lifetime, a corpus of legends developed around Cao Cao which built upon his talent, his cruelty, and his perceived eccentricities.

Cao Cao began his career as an official under the Han government and held various appointments including that of a district security chief in the capital and the chancellor of a principality. He rose to prominence in the 190s during which he recruited his own followers, formed his own army, and set up a base in Yan Province (covering parts of present-day Henan and Shandong). In 196, he received Emperor Xian, the figurehead Han sovereign who was previously held hostage by other warlords such as Dong Zhuo, Li Jue, and Guo Si. After he established the new imperial capital in Xuchang, Emperor Xian and the central government came under his direct control, but he still paid nominal allegiance to the emperor. Throughout the 190s, Cao Cao actively waged wars in central China against rival warlords such as Lü Bu, Yuan Shu, and Zhang Xiu, eliminating all of them. Following his triumph over the warlord Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu in 200, Cao Cao launched a series of campaigns against Yuan Shao&#x27;s sons and allies over the following seven years, defeated them, and unified much of northern China under his control. In 208, shortly after Emperor Xian appointed him as Imperial Chancellor, he embarked on an expedition to gain a foothold in southern China, but was defeated by the allied forces of the warlords Sun Quan, Liu Bei, and Liu Qi at the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs.

His subsequent attempts over the following years to annex the lands south of the Yangtze River never proved successful. In 211, he defeated a coalition of northwestern warlords led by Ma Chao and Han Sui at the Battle of Tong Pass. Five years later, he seized Hanzhong from the warlord Zhang Lu, but lost it to Liu Bei by 219. In the meantime, he also received many honours from Emperor Xian. In 213, he was created Duke of Wei and granted a fief covering parts of present-day Hebei and Henan. In 216, he was elevated to the status of a vassal king under the title &quot;King of Wei&quot; and awarded numerous ceremonial privileges, of which some used to be reserved exclusively for emperors. Cao Cao died in Luoyang in March 220 and was succeeded by his son Cao Pi who accepted the abdication of Emperor Xian in November 220 and established the state of Cao Wei to replace the Eastern Han dynasty— an event commonly seen as a usurpation. This marked the transition from the Eastern Han dynasty to the Six Dynasties period. After taking the throne, Cao Pi granted his father the posthumous title &quot;Emperor Wu&quot; (&quot;Martial Emperor&quot;) and the temple name &quot;Taizu&quot; (&quot;Grand Ancestor&quot;).

Apart from being lauded as a brilliant political and military leader, Cao Cao is celebrated for his poems which were characteristic of the Jian&#x27;an style of Chinese poetry. Opinions of him have remained divided from as early as the Jin dynasty (266–420) that came immediately after the Three Kingdoms period. There were some who praised him for his achieve­ments in poetry and his career, but there were also others who condemned him for his cruelty, cunning, and allegedly traitorous ways. In traditional Chinese culture, Cao Cao is stereotypically portrayed as a sly, power-hungry, and treacherous tyrant who serves as a nemesis to Liu Bei, often depicted in contraposition as a hero trying to revive the declining Han dynasty. During the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), Luo Guanzhong wrote the epic novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, dramatising historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. He not only cast Cao Cao as a primary antagonist in the story, but also introduced, fictionalised, and exaggerated certain events to enhance Cao Cao&#x27;s &quot;villainous&quot; image.

==Historical sources==
The authoritative historical source on Cao Cao&#x27;s life is his official biography in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; written by Chen Shou in the third century. His sources for his work on the Wei portion of his book (; &quot;Wei Zhi&quot;) included the &quot;Dongguan Ji&quot; (; now lost), the &quot;Book of Wei&quot;, and possibly other records. Chen Shou worked in the history bureau and had access to a variety of sources, but followed the traditional method of incorporating information into a single synthesis without citing his sources, so it is not clear how broad a pool of documentation he drew upon.

In the fifth century, Pei Songzhi annotated the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; by incorporating information from other sources to Chen Shou&#x27;s original work and adding his personal commentary, as well as commentary from other historians.

One of the major sources for information on Cao Cao&#x27;s life employed by Pei Songzhi was the official history of the Wei dynasty, the &quot;Book of Wei&quot;, largely composed during the Wei dynasty itself by Wang Chen, Xun Yi, and Ruan Ji. It was completed by Wang Chen and presented to the court during the opening years of the succeeding Western Jin dynasty. This work is understandably typically very favourable to Cao Cao as the founding figure of the dynasty under which the initial compilation was performed.

As a counterpoint, another significant source for Cao Cao&#x27;s life as cited by Pei Songzhi was the &quot;Cao Man zhuan&quot; (), an anonymous collection of anecdotes said to have been compiled by a person from Eastern Wu, a rival kingdom to Cao Cao&#x27;s own. This work is overall very hostile to Cao Cao, depicting him as cruel and untrustworthy, although not every anecdote is negative. &quot;Cao Man zhuan&quot; has been characterised as &quot;hostile propaganda&quot;, and certain contents as &quot;slanderous&quot;. Such a work cannot be considered a reliable source, but informs an exaggerated perspective contraposed to the glowing portrait painted by his own dynasty&#x27;s official history.

For much of his career, Cao Cao hosted and controlled the final Han emperor, whose doings and correspondence it was standard to record. Especially useful for noting things like official appointments, three titles of this type were used by Pei Songzhi to add detail to Chen Shou&#x27;s account: &quot;Xiandi Ji&quot; (; &quot;Records of Emperor Xian&quot;) compiled by Liu Ai (), &quot;Xiandi Qiju zhu&quot; (; &quot;Notes on Emperor Xian&#x27;s Daily Life&quot;), and &quot;Shanyang Gong zaiji&quot; (; &quot;Records of the Duke of Shanyang&quot; [Emperor Xian&#x27;s post-usurpation title]) by Yue Zi 

Other early sources for Pei Songzhi included Yu Huan&#x27;s privately composed histories &quot;Dianlüe&quot; (; &quot;Authoritative Account&quot;) and &quot;Weilüe&quot;, written prior to Chen Shou&#x27;s own work; and Sima Biao&#x27;s &quot;Annals of the Nine Provinces&quot; (), also from the 3rd century.

Later sources included works by the moralistic historian Sun Sheng, most saliently his &quot;Chronicles of the Clans of Wei&quot; (), but also his more critical &quot;Yitong Ping&quot; (; &quot;Commentary on Similarities and Differences&quot;) and &quot;Yitong Zayu&quot; (; &quot;Miscellaneous Words on Similarities and Differences&quot;), which may have been parts of the same work. Although Pei Songzhi sometimes pointed out flaws in Sun Sheng&#x27;s methods, he often cites him as an authority. Other Jin dynasty historians he gave less credence to, while still including parallel passages from their work, such as &quot;Jiangbiao zhuan&quot; (江表傳), by and &quot;Wei Jin Shiyu&quot; (; &quot;Tales of the Worlds of Wei and Jin&quot;) by a work which Pei Songzhi denigrated in very strident terms.

The official standard history of the Eastern Han dynasty, the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; by Fan Ye, was not available to Pei Songzhi. He and Fan Ye were contemporaries, but Fan Ye did not begin work on his history until a few years after Pei Songzhi completed his. The &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; does not contain a full biography of Cao Cao, but records of him and his actions can be found scattered in disparate locations in the book.

Some of Cao Cao&#x27;s own writing – both literary and in the form of government edicts – has been preserved in later collectanea. His commentary on &quot;The Art of War&quot; is extant, but offers little insight into his life.

==Background and early life (155–184)==
Cao Cao&#x27;s ancestral home was in Qiao County (), Pei State, which is present-day Bozhou, Anhui. He was purportedly a descendant of Cao Shen, a statesman of the early Western Han dynasty (206 BCE9 CE). His father, Cao Song, served as the Grand Commandant during the reign of Emperor Ling (), buying his way into high government office for an exorbitant sum, and serving less than half a year. Cao Song was a foster son of Cao Teng, a eunuch who served as a Central Regular Attendant and the Empress&#x27;s Chamberlain under Emperor Huan (), and held the peerage of Marquis of Fei Village ().

In his youth, Cao Cao was known to be perceptive and manipulative. He liked to hunt, idle, roam about freely, and play vigilante so he was not as highly regarded as his more studious peers. From the time Cao Cao was fifteen until he turned thirty, widespread epidemic diseases ravaged China on average one out of every three years.

Despite Cao Cao&#x27;s loafing ways and unimpressive behaviour, there were two persons – Qiao Xuan and He Yong – who recognised his potential and extraordinary talents. Upon visiting the famous commentator and character evaluator Xu Shao, Cao Cao was assessed as being &quot;a treacherous villain in times of peace, and a hero in times of chaos&quot;. Another source recorded that Xu Shao told Cao Cao, &quot;You will be a capable minister in times of peace, and a &quot;jianxiong&quot; in times of chaos.&quot;

==Early career (184–189)==
===As the Commandant of the North District in Luoyang===

Cao Cao started his career as a civil service cadet after he was nominated as a &quot;xiaolian&quot; around the age of 19. He was later appointed as the Commandant of the North District () of the imperial capital Luoyang and put in charge of maintaining security in that area. Later that year, he was transferred to the position of Prefect of Dunqiu County (; near present-day Qingfeng County, Henan). This represented a horizontal career move to a position of greater authority in a smaller jurisdiction with less political importance.

===As a Consultant===
Cao Cao&#x27;s cousin married Song Qi (宋奇), a relative of Empress Song. In 178, when Emperor Ling deposed Empress Song in the aftermath of a political scandal, the empress&#x27;s family and relatives got into trouble as well. Because of his relationship with Song Qi, Cao Cao was implicated in the scandal and dismissed from office. However, he was pardoned later and recalled to Luoyang to serve as a Consultant () under the Minister of the Household because of his expertise in history. The general Dou Wu and senior minister Chen Fan plotted to get rid of the Ten Attendants, a eunuch faction— their plan failed and they lost their lives. Cao Cao wrote a memorial to Emperor Ling to defend Dou Wu and Chen Fan, and point out that the imperial court was full of corrupt officials and that advice from loyal officials had been ignored. Emperor Ling did not listen to him.

Emperor Ling later issued a decree, ordering the Three Ducal Ministers to report and dismiss commandery and county officials who performed badly in office. However, the Ministers protected the under-performing officials and accepted bribes, resulting in a situation where evildoers were not punished while the poor and weak were oppressed. Cao Cao felt frustrated when he saw this. When natural disasters occurred, Cao Cao was summoned to the imperial court to discuss the problems in the administration. During this time, he wrote another memorial to Emperor Ling, accusing the Three Ducal Ministers of siding with the nobles and elites, and helping them to cover up their misdeeds. Emperor Ling was stunned after reading the memorial. He admonished the Ministers for their conduct, reinstated the officials who had been wrongly dismissed, and appointed them as Consultants. However, corruption worsened over time and became rampant throughout all levels of the government. Cao Cao stopped speaking up when he realised that his efforts to restore order were futile.

===As Chancellor of Jinan===
In 184, when the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out, the Han central government commissioned Cao Cao as a Cavalry Commandant () and ordered him to lead imperial forces to attack the rebels in Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡; around present-day Xuchang, Henan). He was later appointed as the Chancellor of (濟南郡; around present-day Jinan, Shandong), a principality in Qing Province which had over 10 counties under its jurisdiction. Many senior officials in Jinan State had connections with the nobles and engaged in corrupt practices, so Cao Cao proposed to the imperial court to dismiss about 80 percent of them. As Cao Cao had a reputation for being a strict law enforcer, when news of his arrival reached these corrupt officials, they were so fearful that they fled to nearby commanderies. Cao Cao governed Jinan State well and maintained peace in the area.

In the early days of the Western Han, nearly four hundred years previously, Liu Zhang (劉章), the Prince of Chengyang State (城陽國; around present-day Ju County, Shandong), felt that he had made great contributions to the Han Empire so he built temples in his principality for the people to worship him. Many other commanderies in Qing Province also followed this practice. In Jinan State alone, there were over 600 such temples. Wealthy merchants could even borrow the servants and personal carriages of officials for their own leisure activities. This resulted in greater inequality between the rich and poor. The senior officials did not dare to interfere. When Cao Cao assumed office in Jinan State, he destroyed all the temples and banned such idolatrous practices. He upheld the laws sternly and eliminated unorthodox customs and cult-like activities.

===Brief resignation===
After serving as chancellor for a brief time, Cao Cao was reassigned to be the Administrator of Dong Commandery (東郡; around present-day Puyang County, Henan), but he declined the appointment on the grounds of poor health, and resigned and went home. The &quot;Book of Wei&quot; recorded that around the time, corruption had deteriorated to the point where influential officials dominated the imperial court and blatantly abused their powers. Cao Cao was unable to stop them and feared that he might bring trouble to his family because he had been interfering with their activities, so he requested to serve in the Imperial Guards. His request was rejected and he was appointed as a Consultant () instead. He then claimed that he was ill and resigned and went home. He built a house outside the city and lived there, spending his time reading in spring and summer, and going on hunting excursions in autumn and winter.

Wang Fen (王芬), the Inspector of Ji Province, along with Xu You, Zhou Jing (周旌) and others, plotted to overthrow Emperor Ling and replace him with the Marquis of Hefei (). They contacted Cao Cao and asked him to join them but he refused. Wang Fen&#x27;s plan ultimately failed. 

Cao Cao was appointed as Colonel Who Arranges the Army () and summoned back to Luoyang to serve in the Army of the Western Garden when Bian Zhang, Han Sui and others started a rebellion in Liang Province.

==Campaign against Dong Zhuo (189–191)==
===Background===
Emperor Ling died in 189 and was succeeded by his son, Liu Bian, who is historically known as Emperor Shao. As Emperor Shao was still young, his mother Empress Dowager He and maternal uncle He Jin ruled as regents on his behalf. He Jin plotted with Yuan Shao and others to eliminate the eunuch faction, and shared their plan with his sister. When the empress dowager was reluctant to kill the eunuchs, He Jin thought of summoning generals stationed outside Luoyang to lead their troops into the imperial capital to put pressure on the empress dowager. Cao Cao strongly objected to He Jin&#x27;s idea as he believed that the best way to deal with the eunuchs was to eliminate their leaders. He also argued that summoning external forces into Luoyang would only increase the risk of their plan being leaked out. He Jin – the highest-ranking officer in the government – understandably ignored him.

As Cao Cao predicted, the eunuchs got wind of He Jin&#x27;s plot and assassinated him before the generals and their troops arrived. Yuan Shao and He Jin&#x27;s followers led their forces to storm the imperial palace and slaughter the eunuchs in revenge. Emperor Shao and his younger half-brother, Liu Xie, escaped during the chaos. They were eventually found and brought back to the palace by Dong Zhuo, who took advantage of the power vacuum to seize control of the central government. Later that year, Dong Zhuo deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with Liu Xie, who is historically known as Emperor Xian. The deposed Emperor Shao became the Prince of Hongnong.

Dong Zhuo wanted to appoint Cao Cao as a Colonel of Valiant Cavalry () and recruit him as an adviser. However, Cao Cao adopted a fake identity, escaped from Luoyang, and returned to his home in Chenliu Commandery (陳留郡; near present-day Kaifeng). He had two encounters along the way. The first was with the family of Lü Boshe, an old acquaintance. The second incident occurred when he passed by Zhongmu County, where a village chief suspected that he was a fugitive and arrested him. However, another official recognised Cao Cao and believed he could act as a positive influence, so he released Cao Cao.

===The campaign===

Dong Zhuo murdered the Prince of Hongnong and Empress Dowager He later. When Cao Cao returned to Chenliu Commandery, he spent his family fortune on raising an army to eliminate Dong Zhuo. In the winter of 189, Cao Cao assembled his forces in Jiwu County (; southwest of present-day Ningling County, Henan) and declared war on Dong Zhuo.

In early 190, several regional officials and warlords formed a coalition army numbering some tens of thousands, and launched a punitive campaign against Dong Zhuo. They declared that their mission was to free Emperor Xian and the central government from Dong Zhuo&#x27;s control. Yuan Shao was elected as the coalition chief while Cao Cao served as acting General of Uplifting Martial Might (). The coalition scored some initial victories against Dong Zhuo&#x27;s forces and reached Luoyang within months. Dong Zhuo, alarmed by his losses, ordered his troops to forcefully relocate Luoyang&#x27;s residents to Chang&#x27;an and burn down the imperial capital, leaving behind nothing for the coalition.

While Dong Zhuo was retreating to Chang&#x27;an, Cao Cao led his own army to pursue the enemy, but was defeated by Xu Rong, a general under Dong Zhuo, at the Battle of Xingyang. This was the first military action Cao Cao commanded, and he barely escaped alive, with help from his cousin Cao Hong. He returned to the coalition base in Suanzao County (; southwest of present-day Yanjin County, Henan) and was disgusted to see that the other coalition members were making merry instead of thinking how to make progress. He presented his plan on how to continue the war against Dong Zhuo and chided them for their lacklustre attitudes towards their initial goals. They ignored him.

===Aftermath===
As Cao Cao had few troops left with him after the Battle of Xingyang, he travelled to Yang Province with Xiahou Dun to recruit soldiers. Chen Wen, the Inspector of Yang Province, and Zhou Xin, the Administrator of Danyang Commandery (丹楊郡), gave him over 4,000 troops. On the way back, when they passed by Longkang County (; in present-day Huaiyuan County, Anhui), many soldiers started a mutiny and set fire to Cao Cao&#x27;s tent at night, but he was able to escape. When Cao Cao reached Zhi (; west of present-day Suzhou, Anhui) and Jianping (; southwest of present-day Xiayi County, Henan) counties later, he managed to regroup over 1,000 soldiers and lead them to a garrison in Henei Commandery (河內郡; around present-day Wuzhi County, Henan).

Yuan Shao and Han Fu thought of installing Liu Yu, the Governor of You Province, on the throne to replace Emperor Xian. When they sought Cao Cao&#x27;s opinion, Cao Cao refused to support them and reaffirmed his allegiance to Emperor Xian. Yuan Shao&#x27;s plan turned out to be unsuccessful because Liu Yu himself did not want to be emperor.

Yuan Shao once invited Cao Cao to sit beside him and showed him a jade seal, indicating his imperial ambition, and a tacit request for Cao Cao&#x27;s support. Finding this despicable, Cao Cao laughed at him.

==Military exploits in central China (191–199)==
===Pacifying Yan Province===

Between 191 and 192, Yuan Shao appointed Cao Cao Administrator of Dong Commandery (東郡 in Yan Province; near present-day Puyang, Henan. This position allowed him to exact taxes and conscript soldiers. His first territorial command in that respect marks the beginning of his career as a warlord. During this time, he defeated the Heishan bandits, who were causing trouble in the region, and some Southern Xiongnu forces led by Yufuluo in Neihuang County.

Around the time, remnants from the Yellow Turban Rebellion swarmed into Yan Province from Qing Province. Liu Dai, the Governor of Yan Province, was killed in a battle against the rebels. Bao Xin, Chen Gong and others invited Cao Cao to replace Liu Dai as the Governor of Yan Province. Cao Cao defeated the rebels in battle and received the surrender of over 300,000 rebels and hundreds of thousands of civilians (the rebels&#x27; family members). From among them, he recruited the more battle-hardened ones to form a new military unit known as the Qingzhou Corps ().

===Conflict between Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu===

Yuan Shu had disagreements with Yuan Shao so he contacted Gongsun Zan, Yuan Shao&#x27;s rival in northern China, for help in dealing with Yuan Shao. Gongsun Zan instructed Liu Bei, Shan Jing () and Tao Qian to garrison at Gaotang, Pingyuan and Fagan (; east of present-day Guan County, Shandong) counties respectively to put pressure on Yuan Shao. Yuan Shao allied with Cao Cao and defeated all the opposing forces. In the spring of 193, Cao Cao defeated Yuan Shu at the Battle of Fengqiu and returned to Dingtao County by summer.

===Conflict with Tao Qian===

Between 193 and 194, Cao Cao came into conflict with Tao Qian, the Governor of Xu Province, and attacked Xu Province three times. The first attack took place in the autumn of 193, when Cao Cao attacked Tao Qian after the latter supported Que Xuan (闕宣), who had committed treason by declaring himself emperor. The second and third invasions were triggered by the murder of Cao Cao&#x27;s father, Cao Song, in Xu Province, which occurred when Cao Song was en route to Qiao County (; present-day Bozhou, Anhui) after his retirement. Although Tao Qian&#x27;s culpability in the murder was questionable, Cao Cao nonetheless held him responsible for his father&#x27;s death. During the invasions, Cao Cao conquered several territories in Xu Province and massacred thousands of civilians. Cao Cao&#x27;s assault on Xu Province was so brutal that after one massacre the corpses of his victims stoppered up the nearby Si river (). His army tore down villages in its wake, ensuring refugees could not return, and ate all the chickens and dogs. Cao Cao only turned back when he received news that his base in Yan Province had fallen to Lü Bu.

===War with Lü Bu===
In 194, Cao Cao&#x27;s subordinates Zhang Miao, Chen Gong and others rebelled against him in Yan Province and defected to the rival warlord Lü Bu. Many commanderies and counties in Yan Province responded to Lü Bu&#x27;s call and defected to his side except for a few. Cao Cao aborted his campaign in Xu Province and returned to attack Lü Bu. In one battle at Puyang County, he fell into an ambush and suffered some burns but managed to survive and escape. Cao Cao and Lü Bu were locked in a stalemate at Puyang County for over 100 days until Lü Bu left the county when his supplies ran out due to natural disasters such as locust plagues and droughts. Grain supplies were so limited that Cao Cao strongly considered an offer to serve under Yuan Shao, but was persuaded against it and ceased recruitment instead. He sent his army to collect food, but his numerically inferior forces were able to turn back an attack by Lü Bu that summer using deceptive tactics.

From 194 to late 195, Cao Cao attacked the territories in Yan Province and managed to retake them from Lü Bu. Lü Bu fled east to Xu Province and took refuge under Liu Bei, who had succeeded Tao Qian as the Governor of Xu Province earlier in 194. In the winter of 195, the central government officially designated Cao Cao as the Governor of Yan Province.

In 196, Lü Bu turned against his host and seized control of Xu Province from Liu Bei, but still allowed Liu Bei to remain in Xiaopei (; present-day Pei County, Jiangsu). Although he agreed to an alliance with Yuan Shu earlier, he broke his promise and severed ties with Yuan Shu when the latter declared himself emperor in early 197. Throughout 197, Lü Bu joined Cao Cao and others in a campaign against Yuan Shu, who had become a public enemy because of his treasonous actions. However, in 198, Lü Bu sided with Yuan Shu again and attacked Liu Bei, who lost and fled to join Cao Cao. In the winter of 198, Cao Cao and Liu Bei combined forces to attack Lü Bu and defeated him at the Battle of Xiapi. Lü Bu was captured and executed after his defeat. Cao Cao also pacified the eastern parts of Xu and Qing provinces along the coast.

===Receiving Emperor Xian===
Emperor Xian had been held hostage in Chang&#x27;an by Li Jue, Guo Si and other former followers of Dong Zhuo. Around 195, when internal conflict broke out between Li Jue and Guo Si, Emperor Xian escaped from Chang&#x27;an and after a harrowing journey returned to the ruins of Luoyang, which Dong Zhuo had ordered to be destroyed by fire in 190 when moving the capital to Chang&#x27;an. In Luoyang, Emperor Xian came under the protection of Dong Cheng, former bandit Yang Feng, and other petty strongmen who have been characterised as &quot;ragtag gangsters&quot;. The emperor sought refuge under Yuan Shao, but was rebuffed. In February or March 196, acting on the advice of Xun Yu and Cheng Yu, Cao Cao sent Cao Hong west to fetch Emperor Xian but was blocked by Dong Cheng and Yuan Shu&#x27;s subordinate Chang Nu (). Between March and April 196, Cao Cao defeated Yellow Turban remnants in Runan (汝南) and Yingchuan (潁川) commanderies and was appointed General Who Establishes Virtue (). In July or August 196, Cao Cao was promoted to General Who Garrisons the East () and enfeoffed as the Marquis of Fei Village () – the peerage previously held by his adoptive grandfather Cao Teng.

Sometime between August and September 196, Cao Cao led his forces to the ruins of Luoyang and received Emperor Xian. The emperor granted Cao Cao a ceremonial axe and appointed him Manager of the Affairs of the Imperial Secretariat (錄尚書事) and Colonel-Director of Retainers (司隷校尉). As Luoyang was in bad shape, Dong Zhao and others advised Cao Cao to move the imperial capital to Xu (; present-day Xuchang, Henan). So, in October or early November 196, Cao Cao and his forces escorted Emperor Xian to Xuchang, which became the new imperial capital. Cao Cao had himself appointed General-in-Chief (大將軍) and promoted from a village marquis to a county marquis under the title &quot;Marquis of Wuping&quot; (), later characterised as ten thousand households. Since Dong Zhuo moved the capital from Luoyang to Chang&#x27;an in 190, the imperial court had been in a state of disorder. However, after Cao Cao received Emperor Xian and established the new imperial capital in Xuchang, order was restored, although Cao Cao did have the emperor&#x27;s confidante Zhao Yan (趙彥) killed for secretively keeping the emperor updated on the great affairs of state.

Cao Cao sent an imperial decree to Yuan Shao in Emperor Xian&#x27;s name to appoint him as Grand Commandant (太尉). Yuan Shao was unhappy because Grand Commandant ranked below Cao Cao&#x27;s position, General-in-Chief, so he rejected the appointment. When Cao Cao heard about it, he gave up his position as General-in-Chief and offered it to Yuan Shao. Emperor Xian reappointed Cao Cao as Minister of Works () and acting General of Chariots and Cavalry (車騎將軍). Struck by the difficulties Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu had faced in supplying their armies, as well as his own struggles with food supply in recent years, Cao Cao followed Zao Zhi and Han Hao&#x27;s suggestion to implement the &quot;tuntian&quot; system of agriculture to produce a sustainable supply of grain for his growing army. The &quot;tuntian&quot; agricultural colonies gave Cao Cao an advantage over his adversaries, allowing him to resettle internally displaced refugees, redevelop abandoned arable lands, shorten his supply lines, reduce the amount of defensive assets tasked to defend farms and granaries, and increase the area and productivity of lands held directly by the state.

===Battles with Zhang Xiu===
In early 197, Cao Cao led his forces to Wancheng (; present-day Wancheng District in Nanyang, Henan) to attack a rival warlord, Zhang Xiu. Zhang Xiu initially surrendered without a fight, but due to ill treatment changed his mind and attacked Cao Cao and caught him off guard. Cao Cao lost his eldest son Cao Ang, nephew Cao Anmin (曹安民) and close bodyguard Dian Wei in the battle. He returned to Xuchang after his defeat, but attacked Zhang Xiu again later that year and pacified Huyang (; southwest of present-day Tanghe County, Henan) and Wuyin (; southeast of present-day Sheqi County, Henan) counties. In early 198, he led another campaign against Zhang Xiu and besieged him in Rangcheng (; present-day Dengzhou, Henan) but withdrew his forces about two months later. Before retreating back to Xuchang, he set up an ambush and defeated Zhang Xiu&#x27;s pursuing forces. In late 199, acting on Jia Xu&#x27;s advice, Zhang Xiu voluntarily surrendered to Cao Cao, who accepted his surrender.

===Campaign against Yuan Shu===

In early 197, Yuan Shu declared himself emperor in Shouchun (; present-day Shou County, Anhui) – an act regarded as treason against Emperor Xian. He soon came under attack by Cao Cao and various forces, including his former ally Lü Bu. In the autumn of 197, Cao Cao defeated Yuan Shu in battle, captured several of his officers, and had them executed. By 199, some months after Lü Bu&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Xiapi, Yuan Shu, who was already in dire straits, wanted to abandon his lands in the Huainan region and head north to join Yuan Shao. Cao Cao sent Liu Bei and Zhu Ling to lead forces to intercept and block Yuan Shu in Xu Province. Yuan Shu died of illness while under siege by Liu Bei and Zhu Ling.

==War with Yuan Shao (199–202)==

===Background===
While Cao Cao was waging wars throughout central China in the 190s, Yuan Shao defeated his rival Gongsun Zan at the Battle of Yijing in 199, after which he controlled four provinces in northern China (Ji, Bing, Qing and You) and gained command of thousands of troops. A power struggle between Cao Cao and Yuan Shao became inevitable by early 199. In the autumn of 199, Cao Cao dispatched troops to Liyang County (; present-day Xun County, Henan) and sent Zang Ba and others to capture some territories in Qing Province while leaving Yu Jin to guard the southern bank of the Yellow River. In winter, he mobilised his forces and deployed them at Guandu (; present-day Guandu Town, Zhongmu County, Henan).

====Campaign against Liu Bei in Xu Province====
Around this time, Cheng Yu and Guo Jia had warned Cao Cao against allowing Liu Bei to leave Xuchang but it was too late because Cao Cao had already sent Liu Bei to intercept and block Yuan Shu. Earlier, when he was still in Xuchang, Liu Bei had secretly joined a plot initiated by Dong Cheng and others to get rid of Cao Cao. After leaving Xuchang, Liu Bei headed to Xu Province, killed the provincial inspector Che Zhou (車冑), and seized control of Xu Province. Cao Cao sent Liu Dai () and Wang Zhong to attack Liu Bei but they were defeated.

In February 200, Cao Cao got wind of Dong Cheng&#x27;s plot and had all the conspirators arrested and executed. He then led a campaign to retake Xu Province from Liu Bei, defeated him, and captured his family. Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu, who was guarding Xu Province&#x27;s capital, Xiapi (; present-day Pizhou, Jiangsu), surrendered and temporarily served Cao Cao. Liu Bei fled north to join Yuan Shao after his defeat. Some of Cao Cao&#x27;s subordinates initially expressed worries that Yuan Shao might attack them while Cao Cao was away in Xu Province, but, as Cao Cao accurately predicted, Yuan Shao did not make any advances throughout this period of time, possibly due to Cao Cao&#x27;s general Yu Jin&#x27;s raiding in the south of Yuan Shao&#x27;s territory.

===Early stages===
From early to mid 200, the forces of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed in two separate engagements at Boma (; present-day Hua County, Henan) and Yan Ford (; near present-day Yanjin County, Henan). At Boma, Yuan Shao sent Guo Tu, Chunyu Qiong and Yan Liang to besiege Cao Cao&#x27;s general Liu Yan (), but the siege was lifted after about two months when Cao Cao personally led an army to relief Liu Yan. Guan Yu slew Yan Liang in the midst of battle. While Cao Cao and his troops were evacuating Boma&#x27;s residents, Yuan Shao&#x27;s forces led by Wen Chou and Liu Bei caught up with them at Yan Ford, but were defeated and Wen Chou was killed in battle. Cao Cao returned to his main camp at Guandu while Yuan Shao moved to Yangwu County (; southwest of present-day Yuanyang County, Henan). Around this time, Guan Yu left Cao Cao and returned to Liu Bei.
===Stalemate at Guandu and the raid on Wuchao===
In late 200, Yuan Shao led his forces to attack Cao Cao at Guandu. Both sides were locked in a stalemate for months and Cao Cao&#x27;s supplies were gradually running out and his men were growing weary. During this time, Yuan Shao sent Liu Bei to contact a rebel chief, Liu Pi (劉辟), in Runan Commandery (汝南郡; near present-day Xinyang, Henan) and join Liu Pi in making a sneak attack on Cao Cao&#x27;s base in Xuchang while Cao Cao was away at Guandu. However, Liu Bei and Liu Pi were defeated and driven back by Cao Cao&#x27;s general Cao Ren. During this time, Sun Ce, a warlord based in the Jiangdong region, also contemplated attacking Xuchang and taking Emperor Xian hostage. However, he was assassinated before he could execute his plan.

In the winter of 200, following the advice of Xu You, a defector from Yuan Shao&#x27;s side, Cao Cao left Cao Hong behind to defend his main camp at Guandu while he personally led 5,000 riders to raid Yuan Shao&#x27;s supply depot at Wuchao (; southeast of present-day Yanjin County, Henan), which was guarded by Chunyu Qiong. Cao Cao succeeded in destroying Yuan Shao&#x27;s supplies. When Yuan Shao heard that Wuchao was under attack, he sent Zhang He and Gao Lan to attack Cao Cao&#x27;s main camp in the hope of diverting Cao Cao&#x27;s attention away from Wuchao. However, Zhang He and Gao Lan, already frustrated with Yuan Shao, destroyed their own camps and led their troops to defect to Cao Cao&#x27;s side. The morale of Yuan Shao&#x27;s army fell drastically and they were utterly defeated by Cao Cao&#x27;s forces, after which Yuan Shao hastily crossed the Yellow River and retreated back to northern China. Much of his supplies and many of his soldiers were captured by Cao Cao. Cao Cao also obtained several letters written by spies from his side to Yuan Shao, but he refused to conduct an investigation to find out who the spies were, and instead ordered all the letters to be burnt. Many commanderies in Ji Province surrendered to Cao Cao.

===Aftermath===
In the summer of 201, Cao Cao led his forces across the Yellow River and attacked Yuan Shao again, inflicting another crushing defeat on him at the Battle of Cangting and pacifying the territories in the area. In autumn, Cao Cao returned to Xuchang and sent Cai Yang (蔡揚) to attack Liu Bei, who had left Yuan Shao and allied with another rebel chief, Gong Du (共都), in Runan Commandery. Liu Bei defeated and killed Cai Yang in battle. Cao Cao personally led his forces to attack Liu Bei, who fled south upon learning Cao Cao himself was in command. He took shelter under governor Liu Biao in Jing Province. The following spring, while in his hometown, Cao Cao issued a proclamation characterising his military actions as a righteous uprising.

==Unification of northern China (202–207)==
===Battle of Liyang===

Yuan Shao died of illness in the early summer of 202 and was succeeded by his third son, Yuan Shang. In autumn, Cao Cao attacked Yuan Shang and his eldest brother Yuan Tan and defeated them, forcing them to retreat and hold up inside their fortresses. In the spring of 203, Cao Cao attacked the Yuan brothers again and defeated them. In summer, he advanced towards Ye (present-day Handan, Hebei) and returned to Xuchang later, leaving behind Jia Xin (賈信) to defend Liyang County (; present-day Xun County, Henan). Afterwards, Cao Cao issued an order establishing schools in each of his counties with 500 or more households.

===Defeating Yuan Shao&#x27;s heirs===

Some months after Cao Cao left northern China and returned to the south, internal conflict broke out between Yuan Shang and Yuan Tan as the brothers started fighting over Ji Province. Yuan Tan, who lost to Yuan Shang, surrendered to Cao Cao and sought his help in dealing with his third brother. Cao Cao agreed to assist Yuan Tan, so, in the winter of 203, he returned to northern China. Between spring and autumn in 204, Cao Cao attacked Yuan Shang in his base at Ye and conquered the city. Yuan Shang fled further north to Zhongshan Commandery (中山郡; around present-day Dingzhou, Hebei). After capturing Ye, Cao Cao visited Yuan Shao&#x27;s tomb, weeping for his childhood friend-turned-rival, and spared no effort assuaging Yuan Shao&#x27;s widow. To the delight of the people in Hebei, Cao Cao issued an order exempting them from paying taxes for that year and clamped down on the power of influential landlords in the area. When Emperor Xian offered to appoint Cao Cao as the Governor of Ji Province, Cao Cao declined, preferring to stick to his appointment as the Governor of Yan Province.

While Cao Cao was attacking Yuan Shang in Ye, Yuan Tan, who had previously allied with Cao Cao against his third brother, took over some of Yuan Shang&#x27;s territories and troops for himself. Cao Cao wrote to Yuan Tan to reprimand him for not adhering to their earlier agreement. Yuan Tan became afraid so he retreated to Nanpi County. In the spring of 205, Cao Cao attacked Yuan Tan, defeated him, and executed him along with his family. Ji Province was completely pacified. Around the same time, Yuan Shang had fled to join his second brother Yuan Xi but Yuan Xi was betrayed by his subordinates Jiao Chu (焦觸) and Zhang Nan (張南), who surrendered to Cao Cao. The Yuan brothers had no choice but to head further north to take shelter under the Wuhuan tribes.

In the spring of 206, Cao Cao attacked Yuan Shao&#x27;s maternal nephew Gao Gan, who had surrendered to him initially but rebelled later, and defeated Gao Gan at Hu Pass (; in present-day Huguan County, Shanxi). In autumn, Cao Cao started a campaign against the pirates led by Guan Cheng (). He sent Yue Jin and Li Dian to attack Guan Cheng and pacified the eastern coast.

===Campaign against the Wuhuan===

In the summer of 206, Cao Cao received the surrender of thousands of Heishan bandits led by Zhang Yan. Around the time, Zhao Du () and Huo Nu () killed the Inspector of You Province and the Administrator of Zhuo Commandery (; around present-day Zhuozhou, Hebei), while the Wuhuan tribes from three commanderies attacked Xianyu Fu (鮮于輔) at Guangping County (; west of present-day Miyun District in Beijing). In early autumn, Cao Cao personally led a campaign against them and defeated Zhao Du and Huo Nu, after which his army crossed the Lu River (; in present-day Tongzhou District, Beijing) to help Xianyu Fu by attacking the Wuhuan. They succeeded in driving the Wuhuan away. Cao Cao returned to Ye by winter.

Throughout the period of civil wars during the late Eastern Han dynasty, the Wuhuan tribes in northern China had been taking advantage of the situation to invade You Province, capture and enslave thousands of people living in the area. When Yuan Shao had been in power in northern China, he maintained friendly ties with the Wuhuan, so Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi found refuge under the Wuhuan chieftains. In 207, Cao Cao led a campaign against the Wuhuan and the Yuan brothers and scored a decisive victory over them at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain later that year. The campaign was difficult and dangerous, and Cao Cao rewarded his counselors who had advised him against undertaking it. Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi fled further northeast to Liaodong to take shelter under the warlord Gongsun Kang. When Cao Cao&#x27;s generals were preparing for an invasion of Liaodong, Cao Cao stopped them and predicted that Gongsun Kang would kill the Yuan brothers. Cao Cao was right, as Gongsun Kang arrested and executed the Yuan brothers because he sensed that they posed a threat to him. He then sent their heads to Cao Cao as a gesture of goodwill. Northern China was basically pacified and unified under Cao Cao&#x27;s control by then.

In the spring of 207, Cao Cao announced he would be distributing his wealth amongst those who had aided him, and enfeoffed over twenty of his followers as marquises, with lesser emoluments for the remainder.

==Red Cliffs campaign (207–211)==
===Background===
Cao Cao returned to Ye (present-day Handan, Hebei) in the spring of 208 after pacifying northern China. He ordered the construction of Xuanwu Pool () to train his troops in naval warfare. He also implemented changes to the political system by abolishing the Three Ducal Ministers and replacing them with the offices of the Imperial Chancellor () and Imperial Counsellor (御史大夫). He was officially appointed as Imperial Chancellor in July 208. Around this time he had the famous scholar Kong Rong – later listed by Cao Cao&#x27;s own son Cao Pi as one of the foremost literary talents of the age – put to death for insouciance, along with his family.

In August 208, Cao Cao launched a southern campaign to attack Liu Biao, the governor of Jing Province. Liu Biao died of illness in the following month and was succeeded by his younger son, Liu Cong. Liu Cong was stationed at Xiangyang while Liu Bei moved from Xinye County to Fancheng (; present-day Fancheng District in Xiangyang, Hubei). Liu Cong surrendered in late September or October 208 when Cao Cao and his forces reached Xinye County. Liu Bei and his followers fled towards Xiakou (; in present-day Wuhan) to join Liu Biao&#x27;s elder son, Liu Qi. Cao Cao sent 5,000 riders to pursue Liu Bei and after covering in twenty-four hours they caught up with him and defeated him at the Battle of Changban. Liu Bei managed to escape and retreat safely to Xiakou with a few followers, but lost most of his supplies and equipment to the enemy. Liu Bei later formed an alliance with the warlord Sun Quan, who controlled the territories in the Wuyue region in southern China.

Meanwhile, Cao Cao advanced towards Jiangling County and reformed Jing Province&#x27;s administration. He also rewarded those who helped him gain Jing Province, including those from Liu Cong&#x27;s side who persuaded Liu Cong to surrender to him. Cao Cao appointed Wen Ping, a former general under Liu Biao, as the Administrator of Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡; around present-day Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei) and put him in command of some of his troops. He also recruited members of the scholar-gentry in Jing Province, such as Han Song (韓嵩) and Deng Yi, to serve under him.

===Battle of Red Cliffs===

Liu Zhang, the Governor of Yi Province (present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), had received orders to help Cao Cao recruit soldiers from his province, so he sent the new conscripts to Jiangling County. In late December 208 or January 209, Sun Quan helped Liu Bei by attacking Cao Cao&#x27;s garrison at Hefei. Around the same time, Cao Cao led his forces from Jiangling County to attack Liu Bei. When they reached Baqiu (; present-day Yueyang, Hunan), Cao Cao ordered Zhang Xi () to lead a separate army to reinforce Hefei, and Sun Quan withdrew his forces from Hefei upon receiving news of Zhang Xi&#x27;s arrival. Cao Cao&#x27;s forces advanced to Red Cliffs () and engaged the allied forces of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, but lost the battle. Around that time, an epidemic disease had broken out in Cao Cao&#x27;s army and many had died, so Cao Cao ordered a retreat. Liu Bei then went on to conquer the four commanderies in southern Jing Province.

After his defeat at Red Cliffs, Cao Cao led his remaining forces through Huarong Trail (; near present-day Jianli County, Hubei) as they were retreating. The area was very muddy and inaccessible and there were strong winds. Cao Cao ordered his weaker soldiers to carry straw and hay to lay out the path ahead so that his horsemen could proceed. The weaker soldiers ended up being stuck in the mud and many were trampled to death by the riders. Cao Cao expressed joy after he and his surviving men managed to get out of Huarong Trail safely, albeit suffering much losses. His generals were puzzled so they asked him why. Cao Cao remarked: &quot;Liu Bei, my friend, doesn&#x27;t think fast enough. If he had set fire earlier, we wouldn&#x27;t have been able to get out alive.&quot; Liu Bei did think of setting fire but it was too late as Cao Cao had already escaped.

===After the Red Cliffs campaign===
In the spring of 209, Cao Cao reached Qiao County (; present-day Bozhou, Anhui), where he ordered small boats to be built and staged a naval drill. In autumn, he sailed along the Huai River to the garrison at Hefei, where he issued an order for local officials to provide relief to the families of soldiers who had died in battle. He then established an administration in Yang Province and started a &quot;tuntian&quot; system in Quebei (; south of present-day Shou County, Anhui). He returned to Qiao County in winter.

In the winter of 210, Cao Cao had a Bronze Sparrow Platform (or Bronze Sparrow Terrace) constructed in Ye. In January 211, Cao Cao wrote a long memorial – to the throne as well as to a more general audience including his detractors – declining to accept three counties awarded to him by Emperor Xian to be part of his marquisate, in which he also wrote at length about his life and ambitions.

In the spring of 211, Emperor Xian appointed Cao Cao&#x27;s son, Cao Pi, as General of the Household for All Purposes (). Cao Pi had his own office and served as an assistant to his father, the Imperial Chancellor. At the same time, in accordance with Cao Cao&#x27;s wishes in the essay he wrote earlier, Emperor Xian reduced the number of taxable households in Cao Cao&#x27;s marquisate by 5,000, and granted the three counties to three of Cao Cao&#x27;s sons – Cao Zhi, Cao Ju and Cao Lin – who were enfeoffed as marquises.

Sometime in early 211, Shang Yao () from Taiyuan Commandery started a rebellion in Daling County (; north of present-day Wenshui County, Shanxi). Cao Cao sent Xiahou Yuan and Xu Huang to lead an army to suppress the revolt and they achieved success.

==Battle of Tong Pass (211–213)==

In early 211, Cao Cao ordered Zhong Yao and Xiahou Yuan to lead an army to attack Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. They were due to pass through the Guanzhong region along the way. The warlords in Guanzhong thought that Cao Cao was planning to attack them, so they, under the leadership of Ma Chao and Han Sui, formed a coalition known as the Guanxi Coalition (; &quot;coalition from the west of Tong Pass&quot;) and rebelled against the Han imperial court.

A few months later, Cao Cao personally led a campaign against the rebels and engaged them in battle in the areas around Tong Pass (in present-day Tongguan County, Shaanxi) and the banks of the Wei River. The first engagement took place when Cao Cao&#x27;s forces were crossing the Wei River to the north bank, during which they suddenly came under attack by Ma Chao. Cao Cao and his forces headed back to the south bank later, where they constructed sand walls to keep the enemy at bay.

After some time, the rebels offered to cede territories and send a hostage to Cao Cao&#x27;s side in exchange for peace. Acting on Jia Xu&#x27;s suggestion, Cao Cao pretended to accept the offer to put the enemy at ease and make them lower their guard. Cao Cao later had talks with Han Sui (an old acquaintance of his) on at least two different occasions. The first time was a private conversation between them about old times, while the second time probably took place in the presence of Ma Chao and the other coalition members. Ma Chao and the others started to doubt Han Sui&#x27;s allegiance, especially after Han Sui received a letter from Cao Cao which contained several blotted-out words, making it seem as though the recipient had deliberately edited the letter&#x27;s contents to cover up something. Cao Cao took advantage of the mutual suspicion between the rebels to launch an attack on them and defeated them. Some of the warlords were killed in battle while Han Sui and Ma Chao retreated back to Guanzhong.

===Aftermath===
Cao Cao returned to Ye (present-day Handan, Hebei) in late 211 after receiving the surrender of one of the remaining warlords, Yang Qiu. He left Xiahou Yuan behind to defend Chang&#x27;an, a major city in the Guanzhong region. Ma Chao, who had the support of the Qiang, Di and other tribal peoples in western China, continued to ravage Guanzhong and attack Cao Cao&#x27;s territories. In 213, he killed Wei Kang, the Inspector of Liang Province, seized control of the province, and forced Wei Kang&#x27;s subordinates to submit to him. In late 213, Zhao Qu (), Yin Feng (尹奉) and several other officials in Liang Province rebelled against Ma Chao and drove him out of Guanzhong. With aid from Zhang Lu, Ma Chao returned and struck back at his enemies, but was defeated when Xiahou Yuan led reinforcements from Chang&#x27;an to assist Zhao Qu and his allies. Xiahou Yuan later attacked the remnants of the Guanxi Coalition (including Han Sui) and the various tribes in western China and forced them to surrender. He also eliminated Song Jian (宋建), who had rebelled against the Han government and set up a small kingdom in Fuhan County (; southwest of present-day Linxia County, Gansu).

==Wars with Sun Quan (213–217)==
In early 213, Cao Cao led an army to attack Sun Quan at Ruxu (; north of present-day Wuwei County, Anhui, along the Yangtze River). During the battle, Cao Cao&#x27;s forces destroyed Sun Quan&#x27;s camp on the west bank of the Yangtze and captured Gongsun Yang (), an area commander under Sun Quan. However, overall, both sides did not make any significant gains in the battle.

In mid-214, Cao Cao launched another campaign against Sun Quan against the advice of Fu Gan, one of his advisers. Just like in the previous campaign, he did not make any significant gains so he retreated. In the following year, Sun Quan led his forces to attack Hefei, a heavily fortified city guarded by Cao Cao&#x27;s generals Zhang Liao, Li Dian and Yue Jin, leading to the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford. Zhang Liao and the defenders inflicted a devastating defeat on Sun Quan and his forces.

In the winter of 216, Cao Cao staged a military drill in Ye (present-day Handan, Hebei), during which he personally beat a war drum to direct his troops&#x27; movements and boost their morale. After the drill, he launched another campaign against Sun Quan and arrived in Juchao (; in present-day Chaohu, Anhui) by spring in the following year. In late March or April 217, he ordered his troops to make camp at the Hao Gorge () on the west bank of the Yangtze. Sun Quan had constructed a dock and stationed defences at Ruxu. Both sides clashed at Ruxu and the battle ended with an inconclusive result. Cao Cao withdrew his forces in late April or May 217, leaving behind Xiahou Dun, Cao Ren, Zhang Liao and others to defend Juchao.

==Campaign against Zhang Lu (215)==
In early 215, Cao Cao launched a campaign against Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. He first sent Zhang He, Zhu Ling and others to lead an army to attack the Di tribes blocking the way in Wudu Commandery (武都郡; around present-day Longnan, Gansu). They defeated and massacred the Di population in Hechi County (; northwest of present-day Pingliang, Gansu).

By mid 215, Cao Cao&#x27;s army reached Yangping Pass (; in present-day Ningqiang County, Shaanxi) after making a long and arduous journey across mountainous terrain. When his soldiers started complaining, Cao Cao announced that he would remember them for their contributions to encourage them to move on. Zhang Lu ordered his younger brother Zhang Wei (張衛) and subordinate Yang Ang (楊昂) to lead troops to defend the pass, making use of the mountainous terrain to counter Cao Cao&#x27;s advances. Cao Cao was unable to overcome the enemy after launching assaults so he withdrew to put them off guard. One night, Cao Cao secretly ordered Xie Biao (解忄剽) and Gao Zuo (高祚) to lead a sneak attack on Yangping Pass. Zhang Lu retreated to Bazhong, when he heard that Yangping Pass had been taken. Cao Cao proceeded to occupy Nanzheng County, the capital of Hanzhong Commandery.

After taking control of Hanzhong Commandery, Cao Cao made some administrative changes to the commandery, such as redrawing boundaries and appointing some administrators to govern the newly formed commanderies. In late 215, Zhang Lu led his followers out of Bazhong and voluntarily submitted to Cao Cao, who accepted his surrender and granted him a marquis title. Around the time, Liu Bei had recently seized control of Yi Province (present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from its governor Liu Zhang and occupied Bazhong after Zhang Lu left. Cao Cao ordered Zhang He to lead a force to attack Liu Bei, but Zhang He lost to Liu Bei&#x27;s general Zhang Fei at the Battle of Baxi. About a month after Zhang Lu&#x27;s surrender, Cao Cao left Nanzheng County and headed back to Ye (present-day Handan, Hebei), leaving behind Xiahou Yuan to guard Hanzhong Commandery.

==War with Liu Bei in Hanzhong (217–219)==
In the winter of 217, Liu Bei sent Zhang Fei, Ma Chao, Wu Lan (吳蘭) and others to garrison at Xiabian (; northwest of present-day Cheng County, Gansu). Cao Cao ordered Cao Hong to lead an army to resist the enemy. In the spring of 218, Cao Hong defeated Wu Lan and killed his deputy Ren Kui (任夔). In April or May 218, Zhang Fei and Ma Chao retreated from Hanzhong Commandery while Wu Lan was killed by Qiangduan (強端), a Di chieftain from Yinping Commandery (; around present-day Wen County, Gansu).

In August or early September 218, Cao Cao staged a military drill and launched a campaign against Liu Bei. His army reached Chang&#x27;an in October. In the meantime, Liu Bei&#x27;s forces had already engaged Cao Cao&#x27;s forces, under Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s command, in Hanzhong Commandery. In early 219, Xiahou Yuan was killed in action at the Battle of Mount Dingjun against Liu Bei&#x27;s general Huang Zhong. In April 219, Cao Cao led his forces from Yangping Pass (; in present-day Ningqiang County, Shaanxi) towards Hanzhong via Xie Valley (). Liu Bei made use of the geographical advantage he had – mountainous terrain – to hold off Cao Cao. That July, Cao Cao withdrew his forces back to Chang&#x27;an.

==Battle of Fancheng (219–220)==

In the autumn of 219, Cao Cao ordered Yu Jin to lead seven armies to reinforce Cao Ren, who was under siege by Guan Yu at Fancheng. However, due to heavy rains, the Han River burst its banks and the seven armies were destroyed in the flood. Guan Yu captured Yu Jin, executed his subordinate Pang De, and continued to press on the attack on Cao Ren. Cao Cao ordered Xu Huang to lead another army to help Cao Ren. At the same time, Cao Cao also contemplated relocating the imperial capital from Xuchang further north into Hebei to avoid Guan Yu, but Sima Yi and Jiang Ji told him that Sun Quan would become restless when he heard of Guan Yu&#x27;s victory. They suggested to Cao Cao to ally with Sun Quan and enlist his help in hindering Guan Yu&#x27;s advances. In return, Cao Cao would recognise the legitimacy of Sun Quan&#x27;s claim over the territories in Jiangdong. In this way, the siege on Fancheng would automatically be lifted. Cao Cao heeded their suggestion.

Cao Cao arrived in Luoyang early in the winter of 219 after returning from campaign in Hanzhong. He later led an army from Luoyang to relieve Cao Ren, but turned back before reaching his destination upon receiving news that Xu Huang had defeated Guan Yu and lifted the siege on Fancheng. In the spring of 220, Cao Cao returned to Luoyang and remained there. In the meantime, Sun Quan had sent his general Lü Meng and others to launch a stealth assault on Liu territories in Jing Province while Guan Yu was on the Fancheng campaign, and they succeeded in conquering Guan Yu&#x27;s key bases in Gong&#x27;an County and Jiangling County. Guan Yu, having lost his bases and forced to withdraw from Fancheng, was eventually surrounded by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces and captured in an ambush and executed. Sun Quan sent Guan Yu&#x27;s head to Cao Cao, who arranged a noble&#x27;s funeral for Guan Yu and had his head buried with full honours.

==Titles of nobility (213–220)==
===Duke of Wei===
Cao Cao returned to Ye in the spring of 212 after the Battle of Tong Pass. Emperor Xian granted him special privileges similar to those awarded to Xiao He by Emperor Gao. Cao Cao did not have to have his name announced, did not have to walk in quickly, and had permission to carry a ceremonial sword and wear shoes when he entered the imperial court. Fourteen counties from five different commanderies were segregated from their respective commanderies and placed under the jurisdiction of Wei Commandery (魏郡; around present-day Handan, Hebei).

In 213, after Cao Cao returned from the Battle of Ruxu against Sun Quan, Emperor Xian issued a decree abolishing the fourteen provinces system and replacing it with an older nine provinces system. About a month after Cao Cao returned to Ye, Emperor Xian sent Chi Lü as an emissary to enfeoff Cao Cao as the Duke of Wei (). After Cao Cao refused the customary three times, the emperor sent a thirty-person delegation of officials to make a fourth offer of enfeoffment, which was accepted. In August 213, an ancestral temple and the &quot;sheji&quot; (altars for worshipping the gods of soil and grain) were built in Cao Cao&#x27;s dukedom. Later, Emperor Xian sent a six-person delegation led by high ranking government minister Wang Yi (王邑) to present betrothal gifts of jade, silk, and other precious items to Cao Cao as part of an arrangement for three of Cao Cao&#x27;s daughters to become the emperor&#x27;s concubines: Cao Jie, Cao Hua, and Cao Xian. It is to be understood that these grants of honours, titles, prerogatives, and imperial marriage arrangements were not of the emperor&#x27;s own initiative, but orchestrated by Cao Cao and his staff, who controlled the Imperial Secretariat. As early as the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;, few historians offer Cao Cao the veneer of legitimacy in his appointments and enfeoffments, forgoing mention of the emperor and instead describing the actions as a personal decision.

In October 213, Cao Cao ordered the construction of the Golden Tiger Platform () and a watercourse linking the Zhang River and White Canal (). A month later, he divided Wei Commandery into the east and west divisions, each governed by a Commandant. In December, he established a ducal secretariat in his fief along with the offices of Palace Attendants and the Six Ministers.
In late January or February 214, Cao Cao attended a ceremony, known as &quot;ji li&quot; (), to promote agriculture. In late March or April, Emperor Xian sent Yang Xuan () and Pei Mao (裴茂) as emissaries to present Cao Cao with a golden official seal with a red ribbon and a &quot;yuanyou guan&quot; (), placing Cao (who was still only a duke then) in a position above other nobles.

In December 214 or January 215, Empress Fu Shou wrote a secret letter to her father Fu Wan (伏完) to tell him that Emperor Xian resented Cao Cao for the execution of Dong Cheng. The contents of the letter were hateful. The incident was exposed and Empress Fu was deposed and executed, her family exiled.

In January or February 215, Cao Cao went to Meng Ford (), a historically important spot near the site of the ancient Battle of Muye. Emperor Xian allowed him to make a &quot;maotou&quot; (; a banner decorated with animals&#x27; tails, typically reserved for the emperor) and erect a &quot;zhongju&quot; (; a bell pendant stand) in his ducal palace. Cao Cao later issued two official statements and established a &quot;licaoyuan&quot; (; a justice ministry).

In the spring of 215, Emperor Xian instated Cao Cao&#x27;s daughter, Cao Jie, as the new empress. Cao Cao visited four commanderies and merged them into a new commandery – Xinxing Commandery () – with one of the counties as the commandery capital. In winter, while he was away in Hanzhong Commandery, Cao Cao created the titles of the Five Counsellors and nominal marquis titles for the first time, alongside the original six grades of marquis ranks. These new titles were awarded to Cao Cao&#x27;s men who had made contributions in battle during the campaign against Zhang Lu, as Cao Cao had promised them earlier.

In February or early March 216, Cao Cao returned to Ye (present-day Handan, Hebei) after a successful campaign against Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. Two months later, he attended another &quot;ji li&quot; () ceremony.

===King of Wei===
In June 216, Emperor Xian promoted Cao Cao from a duke to a vassal king under the title &quot;King of Wei&quot; (). Cao Cao summoned Sima Fang, who had recommended him to be the Commandant of the North District in Luoyang early in his career, to meet him in Ye, where they had a chat. Later, the Wuhuan chanyu Pufulu () from Dai Commandery (; northwest of present-day Yu County, Hebei) led his various subjects to Ye to pay tribute to Cao Cao. Around the same time, Emperor Xian instated one of Cao Cao&#x27;s daughters as a princess and granted her a fief with some taxable households. In August 216, the Southern Xiongnu chanyu Huchuquan brought along his subjects to pay tribute to Cao Cao, who treated them like guests. Huchuquan remained in Cao Cao&#x27;s vassal kingdom while the former Southern Xiongnu domain in Bing province was reorganized into the &quot;Five Divisions&quot; (五部) and placed under the supervision of Huchuquan&#x27;s uncle, Qubei. In September, Cao Cao promoted Zhong Yao from the position of Grand Judge () under the Han central government to the Royal Chancellor (相國) of his vassal kingdom. He also established the offices of the Minister of Ancestral Ceremonies (奉常) and Minister of the Royal Clan (宗正) in his vassal kingdom.

In late May or June 217, Emperor Xian allowed Cao Cao to have his personal &quot;jingqi&quot; (; a banner) and have imperial guards clear the path when Cao travelled around. In late June or July, Cao Cao had a &quot;pangong&quot; () constructed. In July or August, Hua Xin was appointed as Imperial Counsellor (御史大夫). Cao Cao also established the office of the Minister of the Guards (衞尉) in his vassal kingdom. In November or December, Emperor Xian granted more ceremonial privileges to Cao Cao: have twelve fringes of pearls on his crown; ride in a golden carriage pulled by six horses; have five other carriages to accompany his main carriage when he travelled around. Cao Cao&#x27;s son, Cao Pi, who was serving as General of the Household for All Purposes () in the Han imperial court, was designated as the Crown Prince () of Cao Cao&#x27;s vassal kingdom.

In February or early March 218, the imperial physician Ji Ben, along with Geng Ji (耿紀), Wei Huang (韋晃) and others, started a rebellion in the imperial capital Xuchang and attacked the camp of Wang Bi (王必), a chief clerk under Cao Cao. Wang Bi suppressed the revolt with the aid of Yan Kuang (嚴匡), an Agriculture General of the Household ().

In late July or August 219, Cao Cao designated his formal spouse, Lady Bian, as his queen consort. Some months later, Sun Quan wrote to Cao Cao, expressing his desire to submit to Cao Cao and urging Cao Cao to take the throne from Emperor Xian. Cao Cao showed Sun Quan&#x27;s letter to his subordinates and remarked: &quot;This kid wants me to put myself on top of a fire!&quot; Chen Qun, Huan Jie and Xiahou Dun also urged Cao Cao to usurp the imperial throne from Emperor Xian, but Cao Cao refused.

==Death (220)==

Cao Cao died on 15 March 220 in Luoyang at the age of 66 (by East Asian age reckoning). He was granted the posthumous title &quot;King Wu&quot; (; &quot;martial king&quot;) by Emperor Xian. His will instructed that he be buried near Ximen Bao&#x27;s tomb in Ye without gold and jade treasures, and that his subjects on duty at the frontier were to stay in their posts and not attend the funeral as, in his own words, &quot;the country is still unstable&quot;. He was buried on 11 April 220 in the Gaoling (; &quot;high mausoleum&quot;). In December 220 or early January 221, after Cao Pi forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne in his favour and established the state of Cao Wei, he granted his father the posthumous title &quot;Emperor Wu&quot; (; &quot;Martial Emperor&quot;) and the temple name &quot;Taizu&quot; (; &quot;Grand Ancestor&quot;).

===Cao Cao Mausoleum===
On 27 December 2009, the Henan Provincial Cultural Heritage Bureau reported the discovery of Cao Cao&#x27;s tomb in Xigaoxue Village, Anyang County, Henan. The tomb, covering an area of 740 square metres, was discovered in December 2008 when workers at a nearby kiln were digging for mud to make bricks. Its discovery was not reported and the local authorities knew of it only when they seized a stone tablet carrying the inscription &#x27;King Wu of Wei&#x27; – Cao Cao&#x27;s posthumous title – from grave robbers who claimed to have stolen it from the tomb. Over the following year, archaeologists recovered more than 250 relics from the tomb. The remains of three persons – a man in his 60s, a woman in her 50s and another woman in her 20s – were also unearthed and are believed to be those of Cao Cao, one of his wives, and a servant.

Since the discovery of the tomb, there have been many sceptics and experts who pointed out problems with it and raised doubts about its authenticity. In January 2010, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage legally endorsed the initial results from research conducted throughout 2009 suggesting that the tomb was Cao Cao&#x27;s. However, in August 2010, 23 experts and scholars presented evidence at a forum held in Suzhou to argue that the findings and the artefacts of the tomb were fake. In 2010, archaeologist Zhang Guo&#x27;an published a book positing that the tomb and the adjacent one actually belonged to Cao Huan (a grandson of Cao Cao) and his father Cao Yu.

In 2010, the tomb became part of the fifth batch of Major Historical and Cultural Sites Protected at the National Level in China. A museum was opened at the site in April 2023.

==Family==
According to historical records, Cao Cao had 15 wives and concubines, 25 sons, six daughters and two adopted sons. His first formal spouse was Lady Ding, who raised his eldest son Cao Ang (born to his concubine Lady Liu). She fell out with him after Cao Ang&#x27;s death and effectively separated from him. After Lady Ding left him, Cao Cao designated Lady Bian, one of his concubines, as his new formal spouse and she remained in this position permanently. Among Cao Cao&#x27;s sons (excluding Cao Ang), the more notable ones are Cao Pi, Cao Zhang, Cao Zhi and Cao Chong, who were, at different points in time, considered as potential candidates to succeed their father. Cao Chong, who was born to Lady Huan, was a child prodigy who devised a method of weighing an elephant by using the principle of buoyancy. Cao Chong died prematurely at the age of 12. Cao Pi, Cao Zhang and Cao Zhi were born to Lady Bian and were known for their individual talents: Cao Pi and Cao Zhi were noted as brilliant writers and poets; Cao Zhang inherited his father&#x27;s military skills. Cao Pi eventually overcame his two younger brothers in a succession struggle and was chosen to be his father&#x27;s heir apparent. Three of Cao Cao&#x27;s daughters – Cao Xian, Cao Jie and Cao Hua – were married to Emperor Xian. Cao Cao&#x27;s two adopted sons, Qin Lang and He Yan, were conceived from his concubines&#x27; previous marriages.

===Research on Cao Cao&#x27;s ancestry===
Cao Cao was a purported descendant of Cao Shen, a statesman of the early Western Han. In the early 2010s, researchers from Fudan University compared the Y chromosomes collected from a tooth from Cao Cao&#x27;s granduncle, Cao Ding (曹鼎), with those of Cao Shen and found them to be significantly different. Therefore, the claim about Cao Cao descending from Cao Shen was not supported by genetic evidence. The researchers also found that the Y chromosomes of Cao Ding match those of self-proclaimed living descendants of Cao Cao who hold lineage records dating back to more than 100 generations ago.

Zhu Ziyan, a history professor from Shanghai University, argued that Cao Ding&#x27;s tooth alone cannot be used as evidence to determine Cao Cao&#x27;s ancestry. He was sceptical about whether those who claim to be Cao Cao&#x27;s descendants are really so because genealogical records dating from the Song dynasty (960–1279) are already so rare in the present day, much less those dating from the Three Kingdoms era (220–280). Besides, according to historical records, Cao Ding was a younger brother of the eunuch Cao Teng, who adopted Cao Cao&#x27;s biological father, Cao Song. Therefore, Cao Cao had no blood relations with Cao Ding; i.e., Cao Ding was not Cao Cao&#x27;s real granduncle. Zhu Ziyan mentioned that Fudan University&#x27;s research only proves that those self-proclaimed descendants of Cao Cao are related to Cao Ding; it does not directly relate them to Cao Cao.

==Personal life==
Cao Cao was known to be frugal and modest in his daily life, showing no particular interest in aesthetic appeal. The clothes and shoes he wore at home were plain and simple. When the folding screens and curtains in his house were damaged, he simply had them mended instead of replaced. He relied on only mattresses and blankets for warmth, and had no decorative ornaments at home. When he met guests, he wore a simple hat and clothes made of raw silk and had a pouch containing a handkerchief and other small items attached to his belt. Outside of his work life, Cao Cao was known to behave in a frivolous and carefree manner. When he chatted with people, he spoke casually, occasionally poked fun at others, and shared everything on his mind. Once, during a meal, he was so amused that he laughed until he knocked his head into the dishes and soiled his face and clothing.

Cao Cao&#x27;s low regard for material wealth influenced not only his personal life, but also his political and military careers and other aspects of his life. In the late Eastern Han dynasty, &quot;fujin&quot;s (; similar to bokgeon), especially those made of silk, became popular among the scholar-gentry and upper class because they felt that wearing a &quot;fujin&quot; made one look cultured and refined. Cao Cao, however, disapproved of wearing expensive headgear as he felt that the country lacked monetary resources due to chaos and famines, hence he advocated replacing silk &quot;fujin&quot;s with the older &quot;bian&quot;s (; a type of cap) made of leather. He also suggested the use of colours (instead of material) to distinguish status in the military. His ideas were implemented. He also invented a type of hat, the &quot;qia&quot; (), for casual wear. He felt that it was a pity to have very extravagant arrangements in weddings, so, when his daughter got married, she was dressed modestly and had no more than 10 ladies-in-waiting to accompany her. After winning battles, he awarded the spoils of war to his men who had made contributions. He heavily rewarded those who deserved to be rewarded; undeserving people who expected to receive something from him had their hopes dashed. When others presented gifts to him, he shared those gifts with his subordinates. He felt that it was of no benefit to own many possessions because such things would eventually wear out. He personally prepared the clothes he would wear at his funeral and the items he would be buried with, which were sufficient to fill up just four trunks.

===Interests and hobbies===
Cao Cao was known to be very skilled in hand-to-hand combat. When he was still a youth, he once broke into the eunuch Zhang Rang&#x27;s personal chambers but was discovered. Armed with only a short &quot;ji&quot; halberd, he brandished the weapon at the guards as he slowly retreated and eventually climbed over the wall and escaped. He also enjoyed hunting and once shot down 63 pheasants in a single day during a hunting expedition in Nanpi County.

Cao Cao was very fond of reading books, especially military classics and treatises. Apart from writing military journals and annotating Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;The Art of War&quot;, he also collected various military books and compiled extracts from them. His works were spread around. He also gave out new reading materials to his officers when they went to battle. He never neglected reading throughout his military career of over 30 years. When Sun Quan encouraged his general Lü Meng to take up scholarly pursuits, he cited Cao Cao as an example: &quot;Mengde agrees that he is already old but he never gives up on learning.&quot;

Some of Cao Cao&#x27;s other interests and hobbies were recorded in Zhang Hua&#x27;s &quot;Bowuzhi&quot;, which mentioned that he enjoyed calligraphy, music and &quot;weiqi&quot;. His proficiency in these arts were comparable to other experts who lived around the same time as him, such as: calligraphers Cui Yuan, Cui Shi (), Zhang Zhi and Zhang Xu (張昶); musicians Huan Tan and Cai Yong; and &quot;weiqi&quot; players Shan Zidao (), Wang Jiuzhen () and Guo Kai (). Cao Cao was also interested in alchemy and the art of longevity. He met and sought help from various &quot;fangshi&quot;s, including Zuo Ci, Hua Tuo, Gan Shi (甘始) and Xi Jian (郄儉). The &quot;Bowuzhi&quot; stated that he attempted tasting wild &quot;kudzu&quot; up to one &quot;chi&quot; in length and sipping wine dipped with zhen&#x27;s feathers.

===Poetry===
Cao Cao was an accomplished poet, as were his sons Cao Pi and Cao Zhi. The &quot;Wei Shu&quot; recorded that whenever he ascended high ground, he would compose odes and poems and turn them into musical pieces with the aid of music accompaniment. He was also a patron of poets such as Xu Gan. Of Cao Cao&#x27;s works, only a remnant remain today. His verses, unpretentious yet profound, helped to reshape the poetic style of his time and beyond, eventually contributing to the poetry styles associated with Tang dynasty poetry. Cao Cao, Cao Pi and Cao Zhi are known collectively as the &quot;Three Caos&quot;. The Three Caos&#x27; poetry, together with additional poets, became known as the Jian&#x27;an style, which contributed to Tang and later poetry. Cao Cao also wrote verse in the older four-character per line style characteristic of the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;. Burton Watson describes Cao Cao as: &quot;the only writer of the period who succeeded in infusing the old four-character metre with any vitality, mainly because he discarded the archaic diction associated with it and employed the ordinary poetic language of his time.&quot; Cao Cao is also known for his early contributions to the Shanshui poetry genre, with his 4-character-per-line, 14-line poem &quot;View of the Blue Sea&quot; (觀滄海).

==Evaluation==
Opinions of Cao Cao have been divided from as early as the Jin dynasty (266–420) – the period immediately after the Three Kingdoms era (220–280) – to modern times. There were some who praised him for his achievements in poetry and his political and military careers, but there were also others who hold unfavourable views of him for his cruelty, cunning and alleged traitorous ways. In traditional Chinese culture and literature, Cao Cao is stereotypically portrayed as a sly, power hungry and treacherous tyrant, serving as a nemesis to Liu Bei.

Chen Shou, who wrote Cao Cao&#x27;s official biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, praised Cao Cao for his exemplary wisdom and sagacity and his promotion of meritocracy in the civil service and the military. Chen Shou&#x27;s concluding remarks on Cao Cao were &quot;an extraordinary man and an outstanding hero of his time.&quot;

During the Tang dynasty (618–907), Emperor Taizong wrote elegiac addresses for Cao Cao, complimenting Cao Cao for his ability to maintain control of the political situation in a turbulent period, and commenting that Cao Cao was &quot;exceptionally brilliant for a military leader but not competent enough to rule as an emperor.&quot; However, Liu Zhiji condemned Cao Cao for his oppressive treatment of Emperor Xian and his role in the murder of Empress Fu Shou and claimed that Cao Cao&#x27;s &quot;crimes&quot; were worse than those of Tian Chengzi and Wang Mang.

In the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127), Sima Guang, who wrote the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, echoed Chen Shou&#x27;s positive views of Cao Cao&#x27;s championing of a meritocratic style of governance and praised Cao Cao&#x27;s acumen for recognising and grooming talents, but also noted that Cao Cao was strict and harsh in upholding laws. During that period, &quot;shuoshu&quot; (traditional Chinese storytelling) was very popular among the masses, so folktales and legends about the Three Kingdoms era were widely circulated and narrated. The poet Su Shi mentioned that &quot;audiences looked distressed when they heard that Liu Bei had lost battles and some even shed tears; they expressed joy and delight when they heard that Cao Cao had been defeated.&quot;

During the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279), Zhu Xi produced the &quot;Tongjian Gangmu&quot; (a condensed version of Sima Guang&#x27;s &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;), in which he regarded Shu Han as the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty and denounced Cao Cao as &quot;cuan ni&quot; ().

In the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), Luo Guanzhong wrote the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. Cao Cao was cast as a primary antagonist in the novel.

The 20th-century writer Lu Xun once said: &quot;Actually, Cao Cao was a very capable person and was at least a hero. I may not agree with Cao Cao, but I am nonetheless always very impressed with him.&quot;

Mao Zedong was known to be a great admirer of Cao Cao and he actively advocated providing historical &quot;redress&quot; for the warlord. His praise on Cao Cao centred on three aspects: Cao Cao&#x27;s literary talents (poetry and writings); Cao Cao&#x27;s contributions to the unification of China (after the Three Kingdoms period); Cao Cao&#x27;s determination in the face of adversity.

Modern historians such as Lü Simian, and Yi Zhongtian have written books to present more balanced views of Cao Cao. Between 2006 and 2007, Yi Zhongtian conducted a series of 52 lectures about the Three Kingdoms, of which nearly a third focused on Cao Cao, on the CCTV programme &quot;Lecture Room&quot;.

==In anecdotes and legends==
===From works preserved in Pei Songzhi&#x27;s annotations===
Cao Cao&#x27;s uncle complained to Cao Song several times about his nephew&#x27;s behaviour, so Cao Cao became more wary of his uncle. One day, Cao Cao encountered his uncle on the street and pretended to twist his mouth and collapse on the ground. When his uncle asked him what happened, he claimed he had been paralysed after suffering from a stroke. Cao Cao&#x27;s uncle went to inform Cao Song, who immediately rushed to the scene, where he saw that his son was well. Cao Song asked his son: &quot;Your uncle says you had a stroke. Is it true?&quot; Cao Cao replied: &quot;I didn&#x27;t have a stroke, but I have lost the love of my uncle, which is probably why he would say something so nasty about me.&quot; Cao Song believed his son and refused to trust his brother again when his brother complained about Cao Cao. Cao Cao was able to do as he wished.

Yuan Zhong (袁忠), the chief administrative officer in Cao Cao&#x27;s hometown, attempted to prosecute Cao Cao when he was still an ill-behaved and idling young rascal. Huan Shao (桓邵), who was also from Cao Cao&#x27;s hometown, treated Cao Cao with contempt when he was still a youth. After Cao Cao became the Inspector of Yan Province in the early 190s, Bian Rang (邊讓), who was from Chenliu Commandery (陳留郡; around present-day Kaifeng), insulted and belittled him. Cao Cao had Bian Rang and his family arrested and executed. Yuan Zhong and Huan Shao fled to Jiao Province to evade Cao Cao, but Cao ordered Jiao Province&#x27;s Administrator, Shi Xie, to track down and kill them along with their families. Huan Shao gave up on escaping, surrendered to Cao Cao and begged for his life. Cao Cao asked him coldly: &quot;You think you can be spared from death just by kneeling in front of me?&quot; He then ordered Huan Shao&#x27;s execution.

After assuming his first appointment as the Commandant of the North District () of the imperial capital Luoyang, he ordered his subordinates to make five-coloured wooden staffs and place them outside the office. He also instructed them to use those staffs to kill any person who violated the night curfew regardless of his/her status. Some months later, an uncle of the influential eunuch Jian Shuo violated the curfew by walking on the streets at night. Cao Cao arrested Jian Shuo&#x27;s uncle and ordered his men to beat him to death. This incident shocked everyone in Luoyang and nobody dared to violate the night curfew after that. The eunuchs resented Cao Cao for his actions but could not do anything to him because he had the law on his side. They then recommended him to serve as the Prefect of Dunqiu County (), sending him out of Luoyang.

During one military expedition, when his army passed through wheat fields, Cao Cao issued an order: &quot;Any person who damages the crops will be executed.&quot; His soldiers immediately dismounted from their horses and trod carefully through the fields. Cao Cao&#x27;s steed rushed into the field and trampled on the wheat. He then summoned his registrar () and asked him what punishment he should receive. The registrar said that according to Confucian philosophy, Cao Cao, a man of exalted status, was exempt from punishment. Cao Cao said: &quot;How can I expect to lead my men if I gave an order and violated it myself? However, I am the commander so I can&#x27;t kill myself. However, I still have to punish myself.&quot; He drew his sword, cut off a lock of his hair and threw it to the ground. In some later traditions, Cao Cao also executes his horse.

Cao Cao was often accompanied by one of his favourite concubines when he slept. Once, before taking a short nap, he instructed her to wake him up a while later. The concubine saw that he was sound asleep so she did not wake him up. When Cao Cao woke up later, he ordered her to be beaten to death.

During another military campaign, when Cao Cao&#x27;s food supplies were running out, he asked his supply officer what they should do. The officer suggested that they reduce the amount of grain rationed out. Cao Cao agreed. Later, when rumours about Cao Cao deceiving his soldiers started spreading around, Cao Cao told the supply officer: &quot;I want to &#x27;borrow&#x27; your life to appease the men, or else the problem can&#x27;t be resolved.&quot; He then executed the officer, put his head on display and announced: &quot;(This man) stole from the granary and reduced the amount of grain rationed out. I had him executed under military law.&quot;

After Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s death in battle, Cao Cao was growing tired of the Hanzhong campaign and wanted to abandon Hanzhong Commandery. He gave an order, &quot;chicken rib&quot; (), which baffled his subordinates, who did not know what he meant. Yang Xiu, a Registrar () under Cao Cao, immediately gave instructions for everyone to pack up and prepare to leave. When they asked Yang Xiu how he knew that Cao Cao wanted to withdraw, Yang Xiu replied: &quot;It&#x27;s a pity to discard a piece of chicken rib, but there&#x27;s nothing from it which can be eaten. The King is comparing Hanzhong to a piece of chicken rib. That&#x27;s how I know he intends to retreat.&quot; Cao Cao withdrew his forces back to Chang&#x27;an afterwards. In Luoyang a few months later, he revisited the office where he first served as a Commandant of the North District () in his early career.

The &quot;Shiyu&quot; and the &quot;Cao Man Zhuan&quot; provided dramatic accounts of the events before Cao Cao&#x27;s death. The &quot;Shiyu&quot; mentioned that after he returned to Luoyang from Hanzhong Commandery, Cao Cao wanted to build a palace hall so he ordered a Zhuolong Shrine () to be demolished to make way, but blood spilled out from a tree. The &quot;Cao Man Zhuan&quot; mentioned that Cao Cao wanted a pear tree to be moved. When the workers uprooted the tree, blood spilled out from its roots, and the workers were all shocked. Cao Cao heard about it and went there to take a closer look. He was disgusted and felt that it was an unlucky omen. He became ill after returning home.

===From the &quot;Shishuo Xinyu&quot;===
Cao Cao and Yuan Shao were close friends and playmates when they were young. Once, they decided to play a prank on a newlywed couple by kidnapping the bride. After breaking into the house, they shouted: &quot;There&#x27;s a thief!&quot; When everyone in the house came out to catch the &quot;thief&quot;, they sneaked into the house and kidnapped the bride. While fleeing from their pursuers, Yuan Shao fell into a hedge covered with thorns and was trapped there. Cao Cao shouted: &quot;The thief is here!&quot; Yuan Shao became panicky so he struggled and managed to free himself and escape. Suggestive parallels have been drawn between this anecdote and the actual political situation of the 190s, when Cao Cao had control over the emperor but was free to chastise Yuan Shao for disloyalty.

When Yuan Shao and Cao Cao were young, Yuan Shao once played a prank on Cao Cao by sending someone to throw a dagger at Cao Cao while he was asleep at night. The dagger landed low and missed Cao Cao. Cao Cao saw that and knew that the thrower would aim higher on the next attempt, so he changed his sleeping posture. He was right because the dagger landed higher on the second throw.

During one military expedition, Cao Cao and his army lost track of their water source and were very thirsty. Cao Cao announced: &quot;There&#x27;s a plum forest filled with juicy plums ahead. We can quench our thirst there.&quot; The soldiers started salivating when they heard that, which temporarily quenched their thirst until they finally found a water source. This story is the origin of the Chinese idiom &quot;thinking of plums to quench one&#x27;s thirst&quot; (), which means to use one&#x27;s imagination to satisfy one&#x27;s craving for something.

Cao Cao often said: &quot;I can sense it when someone is about to harm me.&quot; He once secretly instructed a servant: &quot;Approach me from the side with a concealed dagger and then I will say I can sense it. After you are caught, you mustn&#x27;t say that I told you to do so, and nothing will happen to you. I will reward you handsomely later!&quot; The servant trusted Cao Cao and did as he was told without fear, but Cao still had him executed after he was &quot;captured&quot;. The servant did not realise that he had been fooled, even before he died. Cao Cao&#x27;s enemies, who were plotting to assassinate him, believed that his so-called &#x27;sensing power&#x27; was real and were demoralised by this incident.

Cao Cao often said: &quot;Don&#x27;t approach me when I am asleep. I will subconsciously attack anyone who is near me. Beware, all of you!&quot; Once, while he was taking an afternoon nap, someone covered him with a blanket. He woke up and killed the person. After this incident, when he was asleep, no one dared to approach him.

Once, when Cao Cao was about to meet an emissary from the Xiongnu, he felt that he looked ugly and might not be able to command respect so he ordered Cui Yan to impersonate him while he carried a sword, stood beside Cui Yan, and pretended to be a bodyguard. After the meeting, Cao Cao sent someone to ask the Xiongnu emissary about his impression of the King of Wei. The Xiongnu emissary replied: &quot;The King looks handsome and extraordinary. However, the man who was carrying a sword and standing beside him is a real hero.&quot; Cao Cao had the emissary killed when he heard that.

Cao Cao had a concubine who sang very well but was cruel and malicious. There were many occasions where he wanted to kill her or send her away, but did not do so because he appreciated her singing talent. He then selected another 100 women and ordered his concubine to teach them to sing. After some time, one of the 100 women could sing as well as Cao Cao&#x27;s concubine, so Cao Cao executed his concubine and replaced her with that woman.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==

The 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; by Luo Guanzhong is a romanticisation of the events of the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. While adhering to historical facts most of the time, the novel inevitably reshaped Cao Cao to some extent, portraying him as a cruel and suspicious villain. In some chapters, Luo Guanzhong created or transmitted fictional or semi-fictional events involving Cao Cao. As the novel has been adapted to many modern forms of media, so has Cao Cao&#x27;s image. Given the source material upon which these adaptations are founded, Cao Cao continues to be characterised as a prominent villain.

See the following for some fictitious stories in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; involving Cao Cao:

* Cao Cao presents a precious sword, where Cao Cao attempts to assassinate Dong Zhuo 
* Cao Cao arrested and released by Chen Gong, where Cao Cao&#x27;s actual arrest and release is ahistorically rewritten 
* Lü Boshe, whose entire family is personally murdered by Cao Cao 
* Guan Yu releases Cao Cao at Huarong Trail, which is not where Guan Yu was after the Battle of Red Cliffs
* New Book of Mengde, where Cao Cao plagiarises an ancient military treatise and claims it as original work
* Battle of Tong Pass, where Cao Cao repeatedly alters his appearance to escape Ma Chao 
* Cao Cao&#x27;s death, where Cao Cao imprisons his physician and dies of an untreated head illness

==In popular culture==
Through to modern times, the Chinese equivalent of the English idiom &quot;speak of the devil&quot; is &quot;speak of Cao Cao and Cao Cao arrives&quot; ().

After the Communists won the Chinese Civil War in 1949, there were perceived similarities between Mao Zedong and Cao Cao, so propagandists began a long-term and sustained effort to improve Cao Cao&#x27;s image in popular culture. In 1959, Peng Dehuai wrote a letter to Mao, in which he compared himself to Zhang Fei. Because of Mao&#x27;s popular association with Cao Cao, Peng&#x27;s comparison implied that he had an intuitively confrontational relationship with Mao. Mao had the letter widely circulated in order to make Peng&#x27;s attitude clear to other party members and proceeded to purge Peng and end his career.

===Chinese opera===

Cao Cao is represented as a cunning and deceitful man in Chinese opera, where his character is given a white facial makeup to reflect his treacherous personality. When Luo Guanzhong wrote &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, he took much of his inspiration for Cao Cao from Chinese opera.

===Film and television===
The &quot;Father of Hong Kong cinema&quot;, Lai Man-Wai, portrayed Cao Cao in &quot;The Witty Sorcerer&quot;, a 1931 comedy film based on a story in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; about Zuo Ci playing tricks on Cao Cao. In the Shaw Brothers film &quot;The Weird Man&quot;, Cao Cao appeared in the beginning of the film with Zuo Ci. Zuo Ci was playing tricks on him by giving him a tangerine with no fruit inside. This was later referenced in another film titled &quot;Five Element Ninjas&quot;.

Other notable actors who have portrayed Cao Cao in film and television include:
* Bao Guo&#x27;an in the 1994 Chinese television series &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. Bao won two Best Actor awards at the 1995 Golden Eagle Awards and Flying Apsaras Awards for his performance.
* Damian Lau in the 2008 Hong Kong film &quot;Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon&quot;.
* Zhang Fengyi in the 2008–09 Chinese film &quot;Red Cliff&quot;.
* Chen Jianbin in the 2010 Chinese television series &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; and the 2018 Chinese television series &quot;Cao Cao&quot;.
* Jiang Wen in the 2011 Hong Kong film &quot;The Lost Bladesman&quot;.
* Chow Yun-fat in the 2012 Chinese film &quot;The Assassins&quot;.
* Zhao Lixin in the 2014 Chinese television series &quot;Cao Cao&quot;.
* Yu Hewei in the 2017 Chinese television series &quot;The Advisors Alliance&quot;.
* Tse Kwan-ho in the 2018 Chinese television series &quot;Secret of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.
* Wang Kai in the 2019 Hong Kong film &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot;

===Card games===
In the selection of hero cards in the Chinese card game &quot;San Guo Sha&quot;, there is also a Cao Cao hero that players can select at the beginning of the game.

Cao Cao is also referenced in &quot;&quot;, as the card &quot;Cao Cao, Lord of Wei&quot;. This card is black, the colour representing ruthlessness and ambition, though not necessarily evil. It was first printed in &quot;Portal Three Kingdoms&quot; and again in &quot;From the Vault: Legends&quot;.

===Video games===
Cao Cao appears in all instalments of Koei&#x27;s &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; video game series. He is also featured as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; series. He also features in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Kessen II&quot; as a playable main character.

===Other appearances===
As with most of the other relevant generals of the period, Cao Cao is portrayed as a young female character in the &quot;Koihime Musō&quot; franchise. He is also the central character in the Japanese manga series &quot;Sōten Kōro&quot;. Barry Hughart&#x27;s novel &quot;The Story of the Stone&quot; mentions the &quot;Seven Sacrileges of Tsao Tsao&quot;, most of which involve family.

<text>Marketing management is the strategic organizational discipline that focuses on the practical application of marketing orientation, techniques and methods inside enterprises and organizations and on the management of marketing resources and activities.
Compare marketology,
which Aghazadeh defines in terms of &quot;recognizing, generating and disseminating market insight to ensure better market-related decisions&quot;.

== Structure ==
Marketing management employs tools from economics and competitive strategy to analyze the industry context in which the firm operates. These include Porter&#x27;s five forces, analysis of strategic groups of competitors, value chain analysis and others.

In competitor analysis, marketers build detailed profiles of each competitor in the market, focusing on their relative competitive strengths and weaknesses using SWOT analysis. Marketing managers will examine each competitor&#x27;s cost structure, sources of profits, resources and competencies, competitive positioning and product differentiation, degree of vertical integration, historical responses to industry developments, and other factors.

Marketing management often implies market research and marketing research to perform a primary analysis. For this, a variety of techniques are implemented. Some of the most common ones include:
* Qualitative marketing research, such as focus groups and various types of interviews
* Quantitative marketing research, such as statistical surveys
* Experimental techniques such as test markets
* Observational techniques such as ethnographic (on-site) observation

Marketing managers may also design and oversee various environmental scanning and competitive intelligence processes to identify trends and inform the company&#x27;s marketing analysis.
===Brand audit===
A brand audit is a thorough examination of a brand&#x27;s current position in an industry compared to its competitors and the examination of its effectiveness. When it comes to brand auditing, six questions should be carefully examined and assessed:
#How well the business&#x27;s current brand strategy is working,
#What the company&#x27;s established resource strengths and weaknesses are
#What its external opportunities and threats are
#How competitive the business&#x27;s prices and costs are
#How strong the business&#x27;s competitive position in comparison to its competitors is
#What strategic issues are facing the business

When a business conducts a brand audit, the goal is to uncover the business&#x27;s resource strengths, deficiencies, best market opportunities, outside threats, future profitability, and its competitive standing in comparison to existing competitors. A brand audit establishes the strategic elements needed to improve the brand position and competitive capabilities within the industry. Once a brand is audited, any business that ends up with strong financial performance and market position is more likely than not to have a properly conceived and effectively executed brand strategy.

A brand audit examines whether a business&#x27;s share of the market is increasing, decreasing, or stable. It determines if the company&#x27;s margin of profit is improving, or decreasing, and how much it is in comparison to the profit margin of established competitors. Additionally, a brand audit investigates trends in a business&#x27;s net profits, the return on existing investments, and its established economic value. It determines whether the business&#x27;s financial strength and credit rating are improving or worsening. This kind of audit also assesses a business&#x27;s image and reputation with its customers. Furthermore, a brand audit seeks to determine whether a business is perceived as an industry leader in technology, offering product or service innovations, along with exceptional customer service, among other relevant issues that customers use to decide on a brand of performance.

A brand audit usually focuses on a business&#x27;s strengths and resource capabilities because these are the elements that enhance its competitiveness. A business&#x27;s competitive strengths can exist in several forms. Some of these forms include skilled or pertinent expertise, valuable physical assets, valuable human assets, valuable organizational assets, valuable intangible assets, competitive capabilities, achievements and attributes that position the business into a competitive advantage, and alliances or cooperative ventures.

The basic concept of a brand audit is to determine whether a business&#x27;s resource strengths are competitive assets or competitive liabilities. This type of audit seeks to ensure that a business maintains a distinctive competence that allows it to build and reinforce its competitive advantage. What&#x27;s more, a successful brand audit seeks to establish what a business capitalizes on best, its level of expertise, resource strengths, and strongest competitive capabilities, while aiming to identify a business&#x27;s position and future performance.

=== Marketing strategy ===

Two customer segments are often selected as targets because they score highly on two dimensions:
# The segment is attractive to serve because it is large, growing, makes frequent purchases, is not price sensitive (i.e. is willing to pay high prices), or other factors; and
# The company has the resources and capabilities to compete for the segment&#x27;s business, can meet their needs better than the competition, and can do so profitably.
A commonly cited definition of marketing is simply &quot;meeting needs profitably&quot;.

The implication of selecting target segments is that the business will subsequently allocate more resources to acquire and retain customers in the target segments than it will for other, non-targeted customers. In some cases, the firm may go so far as to turn away customers who are not in its target segment. The doorman at a swanky nightclub, for example, may deny entry to unfashionably dressed individuals because the business has made a strategic decision to target the &quot;high fashion&quot; segment of nightclub patrons.

In conjunction with targeting decisions, marketing managers will identify the desired positioning they want the company, product, or brand to occupy in the target customer&#x27;s mind. This positioning is often an encapsulation of a key benefit the company&#x27;s product or service offers that is differentiated and superior to the benefits offered by competitive products. For example, Volvo has traditionally positioned its products in the automobile market in North America in order to be perceived as the leader in &quot;safety&quot;, whereas BMW has traditionally positioned its brand to be perceived as the leader in &quot;performance&quot;.

Ideally, a firm&#x27;s positioning can be maintained over a long period of time because the company possesses or can develop, some form of sustainable competitive advantage. The positioning should also be sufficiently relevant to the target segment such that it will drive the purchasing behavior of target customers.
To sum up, the marketing branch of a company is to deal with the selling and popularity of its products among people and its customers, as the central and eventual goal of a company is customer satisfaction and the return of revenue.

=== Implementation planning ===
If the company has obtained an adequate understanding of the customer base and its own competitive position in the industry, marketing managers are able to make their own key strategic decisions and develop a marketing strategy designed to maximize the revenues and profits of the firm. The selected strategy may aim for any of a variety of specific objectives, including optimizing short-term unit margins, revenue growth, market share, long-term profitability, or other goals.

After the firm&#x27;s strategic objectives have been identified, the target market selected, and the desired positioning for the company, product, or brand has been determined, marketing managers focus on how to best implement the chosen strategy. Traditionally, this has involved implementation planning across the &quot;4 Ps&quot;: product management, pricing (at what price slot does a producer position a product, e.g. low, medium, or high price), place (the place or area where the products are going to be sold, which could be local, regional, countrywide or international) (i.e. sales and distribution channels), and promotion.

Taken together, the company&#x27;s implementation choices across the 4 P&#x27;s are often described as the marketing mix, meaning the mix of elements the business will employ to &quot;go to market&quot; and execute the marketing strategy. The overall goal for the marketing mix is to consistently deliver a compelling value proposition that reinforces the firm&#x27;s chosen positioning, builds customer loyalty and brand equity among target customers, and achieves the firm&#x27;s marketing and financial objectives.

In many cases, marketing management will develop a marketing plan to specify how the company will execute the chosen strategy and achieve the business&#x27;s objectives. The content of marketing plans varies for each firm, but commonly includes:
* An executive summary
* Situation analysis to summarize facts and insights gained from market research and marketing analysis
* The company&#x27;s mission statement or long-term strategic vision
* A statement of the company&#x27;s key objectives often subdivided into marketing objectives and financial objectives
* The marketing strategy the business has chosen, specifying the target segments to be pursued and the competitive positioning to be achieved
* Implementation choices for each element of the marketing mix (the 4 Ps)

=== Project, process, and vendor management ===
More broadly, marketing managers work to design and improve the effectiveness of core marketing processes, such as new product development, brand management, marketing communications, and pricing. Marketers may employ the tools of business process re-engineering to ensure these processes are properly designed, and use a variety of process management techniques to keep them operating smoothly.

Effective execution may require management of both internal resources and a variety of external vendors and service providers, such as the firm&#x27;s advertising agency. Marketers may therefore coordinate with the company&#x27;s Purchasing department on the procurement of these services. Under the area of marketing agency management (i.e. working with external marketing agencies and suppliers) are techniques such as agency performance evaluation, scope of work, incentive compensation, ERFx&#x27;s and storage of agency information in a supplier database.

=== Reporting, measurement, feedback and control systems ===
Marketing management employs a variety of metrics to measure progress against objectives. It is the responsibility of marketing managers to ensure that the execution of marketing programs achieves the desired objectives and does so in a cost-efficient manner.

Marketing management therefore often makes use of various organizational control systems, such as sales forecasts, and sales force and reseller incentive programs, sales force management systems, and customer relationship management tools (CRM). Some software vendors have begun using the term &quot;customer data platform&quot; or &quot;marketing resource management&quot; to describe systems that facilitate an integrated approach for controlling marketing resources. In some cases, these efforts may be linked to various supply chain management systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), material requirements planning (MRP), efficient consumer response (ECR), and inventory management systems.

=== International marketing management ===
Globalization has led some firms to market beyond the borders of their home countries, making international marketing a part of those firms&#x27; marketing strategy. Marketing managers are often responsible for influencing the level, timing, and composition of customer demand. In part, this is because the role of a marketing manager (or sometimes called managing marketer in small- and medium-sized enterprises) can vary significantly based on a business&#x27;s size, corporate culture, and industry context. 
For example, in a small- and medium-sized enterprises, the managing marketer may contribute to both managerial and marketing operations roles for the company brands. In a large consumer products company, the marketing manager may act as the overall general manager of his or her assigned product.
To create an effective, cost-efficient marketing management strategy, firms must possess a detailed, objective understanding of their own business and the market in which they operate. In analyzing these issues, the discipline of marketing management often overlaps with the related discipline of strategic planning.

<text>William Washington (February 28, 1752 – March 6, 1810) was a cavalry officer of the Virginia militia and Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, who also served on General George Washington&#x27;s staff during the naval war with France in 1798 and held a final rank of brigadier general. Primarily known as a commander of light dragoons, he led mounted troops in a number of notable battles in the Carolinas during the campaigns of 1780 and 1781. Following the conflict, this William Washington moved to South Carolina, where he married and served in the state legislature as well as led the Seventh Brigade of the South Carolina militia. Cavalry Commander William Washington of Stafford County and South Carolina has often been confused with his distant cousin William Augustine Washington, also a Revolutionary War patriot and planter, who served as a delegate representing Westmoreland County, Virginia.

== Before the war ==
Born in Stafford County, Virginia, William was the second son of Bailey Washington and Catherine (née Storke) Washington. Correspondence between William and George Washington, first President of the United States, indicates William and George were second cousins once removed. William received an education appropriate to his Southern slaveowning planter class, including tutoring from Reverend Dr. William Stuart, a Virginia clergyman. William learned the Greek language and may have studied theology for a potential career in the church.

However, in 1775, he established a local Stafford County militia company and soon abandoned his studies and took up arms against the British government during the Revolutionary War. William and his elder brother, Henry, reputedly drew straws to see who would get to join the Continental Army and who would stay home and manage the family plantations. William won.

==Revolutionary War==
Washington was elected a captain of Stafford County Minutemen on September 12, 1775; his militia company was soon assigned to Hugh Mercer&#x27;s newly formed militia regiment, which became part of the 3rd Virginia Regiment, Continental Line on February 25, 1776, with Washington commanding its 7th Company. His lieutenant and second-in-command was fellow Virginian James Monroe, future fifth US. President. Their first combat was the Battle of Harlem Heights in New York on September 16, 1776, during which he may have been wounded by enemy musket fire. At the Battle of Trenton, under command of Nathanael Greene and after a night of scouting the countryside with Monroe to prevent detection, Washington led a successful assault into the town. His company drove in Hessian pickets, and seized two cannon on King Street, capturing their crews. Washington received wounds to both hands during the action, along with Lt. Monroe who was severely wounded in the shoulder. Both received thanks from Continental Army commander-in-chief George Washington.

On January 27, 1777, William was promoted to the rank of major and assigned to the newly created 4th Continental Light Dragoons. In the fall of 1778, he was assigned to the 3rd Continental Light Dragoons, which was severely mauled in a surprise attack on the night of September 27 at Old Tappan, New Jersey, by a force of British light infantry. Only 55 of the lightly armed dragoons escaped the attack and their commander, Lt. Col. George Baylor, was wounded and captured. Washington was promoted to lieutenant colonel and placed in command of the 3rd Light Dragoons on November 20, 1778. Washington&#x27;s unit spent the summer of 1779 recruiting and remounting. On November 19, 1779, his unit was transferred to the war&#x27;s Southern theater, and marched to join the army of Major General Benjamin Lincoln in Charleston, South Carolina.

On March 10, 1780, Washington&#x27;s regiment joined forces with the remnants of the 1st Continental Light Dragoons at Bacon&#x27;s Bridge, South Carolina, to reconnoiter and screen against the advancing British. On March 26, his first encounter with the British Legion, under command of Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton, resulted in a minor victory near Rantowle&#x27;s Bridge on the Stono River in South Carolina. Afterward, on the Ashley River during the fight at Rutledge&#x27;s Plantation on March 26, 1780, Lt. Col. Washington again bested a detachment of Tarleton&#x27;s dragoons and infantry. Tarleton, however, attacked the encampment of General Isaac Huger at Monck&#x27;s Corner on the night of April 14, 1780, and routed the Continentals, including the 3rd Light Dragoons, which lost 15 dead, 17 wounded, and 100 dragoons captured, along with 83 horses.

Washington and his remaining troops fled across the Santee River to escape capture. The severe attrition of Washington&#x27;s command forced its amalgamation with the 1st Continental Light Dragoons under Lt. Col. Anthony Walton White. This force was defeated at Lenud&#x27;s Ferry, waiting to cross the flooded Santee, on May 6, 1780. White was captured and Washington assumed command of the 1st-and-3rd Dragoons. The force withdrew to North Carolina when Lincoln surrendered the southern army and Charleston on May 12.

The reconstituted Southern army, now under General Horatio Gates, was defeated at the Battle of Camden, South Carolina, on August 16, 1780, which opened up the South to British control. Gates was replaced by General Nathanael Greene, who divided his army into two groups, one of which was led by General Daniel Morgan and the other by himself. Washington was placed under the command of General Morgan, for whom he participated in a series of raids in the western part of South Carolina. Two notable successes were the capture of Rugeley&#x27;s Mill near Camden on December 4, 1780; Washington with 60 troops bluffed 112 Loyalists into surrendering a strongly fortified homestead without firing a shot by use of a &quot;Quaker Gun&quot;, mounting a felled tree trunk on wagon axles to resemble a cannon; and the defeat of a Tory partisan unit at Hammond&#x27;s Old Store in the Little River District on December 27, 1780; Washington routed 250 Georgia Loyalists, killing or wounding 150 and capturing the rest.


These successes led to Tarleton being ordered by Lord Cornwallis to chase down Morgan&#x27;s &quot;flying corps&quot;, leading to the Battle of Cowpens on January 17, 1781. Morgan&#x27;s battle plans called for Washington&#x27;s group, 80 Continental dragoons and 45 mounted Georgia infantry, to serve as a defensive and offensive unit as the situation required. Washington&#x27;s first encounter with the enemy involved the rescue of a South Carolina militia unit as it was reloading behind the front lines of Morgan&#x27;s left flank and under attack by a unit of Tarleton&#x27;s dragoons. Crushing the attackers, Washington regrouped and followed with an attack on Tarleton&#x27;s left flank infantry. After repeated assaults by Washington, they moved through the infantry and attacked a small artillery position behind Tarleton&#x27;s front lines.

With the main British infantry surrender and during Tarleton&#x27;s retreat, Washington was in close pursuit and found himself somewhat isolated. He was attacked by the British commander and two of his men. Tarleton was stopped by Washington himself, who attacked him with his sword, calling out, &quot;Where is now the boasting Tarleton?&quot; A cornet of the 17th, Thomas Patterson, rode up to strike Washington but was shot by Washington&#x27;s enslaved orderly trumpeter. Washington survived this assault and in the process wounded Tarleton&#x27;s right hand with a sabre blow, while Tarleton creased Washington&#x27;s knee with a pistol shot that also wounded his horse. Washington pursued Tarleton for sixteen miles, but gave up the chase when he came to the plantation of Adam Goudylock near Thicketty Creek. To escape capture by Washington, Tarleton had forced Goudylock to serve as an escape guide. For his valor at Cowpens, Washington received a silver medal awarded by the Continental Congress executed under the direction of Thomas Jefferson. The unique silver medal was designed by French artists Du Pre and De Vivier. (A British version of this duel can be found under Chapter 33 Year 1781.)

After the Battle of Cowpens, Washington&#x27;s dragoons assisted the retreat of General Nathanael Greene to Dan River in Virginia by rearguard actions against forces commanded by Lord Cornwallis. Afterward, Washington returned to North Carolina to act as vanguard for Greene&#x27;s army.

On March 15, 1781, Greene and Washington fought against Cornwallis and Tarleton at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. The Americans were driven from the field, but about one quarter of Cornwallis&#x27; men were killed or wounded, an unsustainable loss. This forced Cornwallis to move his main army to the coast to regroup.

On April 25, 1781, at the Battle of Hobkirk&#x27;s Hill, Greene was attacked by British colonel Lord Rawdon. Ordered to attack Rawdon&#x27;s flank, Washington was unable to complete the maneuver while policing prisoners, forcing Greene to retreat.

On September 8, 1781, the Battle of Eutaw Springs, the last major battle in the Carolinas, was Washington&#x27;s final action. Midway through the battle, Greene ordered Washington to charge a portion of the British line positioned in a blackjack thicket along Eutaw Creek. The thicket proved impenetrable and British fire repulsed the mounted charges. During the last charge, Washington&#x27;s mount was shot out from under him, and he was pinned beneath his horse. He was bayoneted and taken prisoner, and held under house arrest in the Charleston area for the remainder of the war.

The British commander in the South, Lord Cornwallis, would later comment that &quot;there could be no more formidable antagonist in a charge, at the head of his cavalry, than Colonel William Washington.&quot;

== South Carolina planter and legislator ==
On April 21, 1782, Washington married Jane Riley Elliott of Sandy Hill plantation in Charleston County, South Carolina. They first met when she made his regiment a battle flag that was carried into combat from Cowpens to Eutaw Springs. After the war, the married couple settled on Sandy Hill plantation, which was 28 miles upriver from the port at Charleston, South Carolina and which Jane Elliott owned before their marriage. On 27 December 1785, the new couple purchased a townhouse at 8 South Battery in Charleston. Washington also ownered other properties in Charleston County&#x27;s St. Paul Parish.

Washington farmed as a low-country planter using enslaved labor, as well as raised thoroughbred horses. In the 1800 federal census, Washington owned eighteen enslaved people in Charleston, and possibly was the nonresident planter of the same name who owned five slaves in the state&#x27;s western region being settled by revolutionary veterans using land grants issued for their service.
Washington won election to the State legislature from 1787 to 1804 but refused to run for State Governor because he, in his words, &quot;was not born a Carolinian.&quot; Washington also accepted a post of brigadier general commanding the Seventh Brigade of the South Carolina State Militia in 1794.

During the naval war with France in 1798 former president George Washington was appointed by President Adams&#x27; Administration as commander of the American Army. George Washington offered a general&#x27;s commission and staff position to William Washington, and he accepted the rank of brigadier general and served on George Washington&#x27;s staff. He served the United States Army from 1798 to 1800, and concerned himself with the defenses of South Carolina and Georgia.

==Death and legacy==
After a lingering illness, William Washington died on March 6, 1810, at the age of 58. He was buried at Live Oak, a plantation near Sandy Hill. He was survived by his wife, a son, and a daughter. His daughter was married to General Alexander Spotswood, a grandson of Virginia Governor Alexander Spotswood.

In retrospect, William Washington is viewed as a fine officer and premier cavalry commander. He showed skill, bravery, and daring on the battlefield, inspiring victory and confidence in the war of American Independence from the British Crown.

<doc id="241646" wikidata="Q1779831" url="?curid=241646" title="Cross-platform interchange">
<text>A cross-platform interchange is a type of interchange between different lines at a metro (or other railway) station. The term originates with the London Underground; such layouts exist in other networks but are not commonly so named. In the United States and Canada, it is often referred to as a cross-platform transfer.

This configuration occurs at a station with island platforms, with a single platform in between the tracks allocated to two directions of travel, or two side platforms between the tracks, connected by level corridors. The benefit of this design is that passengers do not need to use stairs to another platform level for transfer. A cross-platform interchange arrangement may be costly to build due to the complexity of rail alignment, especially if the railway designers also arrange the track with flyovers (which is typically done to increase efficiency).

A typical bidirectional cross-platform interchange configuration consists of two outbound directions of two different lines sharing an island platform, and the respective return directions of both lines sharing a different island platform in the same station complex. Less common is a cross-platform interchange to transfer onto a continuation of same single line served by that station, for example in Kirkby, Ormskirk, and Pittsburg/Bay Point.

==Types==
===Between different lines===
Common cross-platform interchanges allow passengers to change trains without changing to another platform. This applies at places where trains of different directions meet in minor and major hubs, but this arrangement is only found at some interchange stations in metro and other rail networks worldwide.

===Between different train categories===
Some railway lines, usually in more congested areas, also offer cross-platform interchanges between different categories of trains, for example between express and stopping (&quot;local&quot;) trains. For instance, this kind of interchange is used at many European railway minor hubs to connect fast trains to local feeder services, as well as surface sections of suburban lines like the RER E in Paris or the Metro North Hudson Line in New York State. However, local–express interchanges are found in only a few metro networks, such as Chicago, Chengdu, London (as in the case of Stratford discussed below), New York City, and Philadelphia. The New York City Subway system has numerous stations facilitating cross-platform transfers between local and express trains, typically using pairs of island platforms, each serving express trains on one side, and local trains on the other side, with both alternatives headed in the same direction.

As express and stopping trains usually head for different directions, cross-platform interchange between different train categories (e.g. interchanges between metros and railways) is commonly combined with cross-platform interchanges between different lines.

Some stations offer cross-platform transfers between different modes, such as tram and bus, such as at Madeleine station in Charleroi, where two island platforms sit between a central bus lane and tram line on the outside. Similarly, light rail–bus connections can be found at Juniors Kingsford and Haymarket light rail stations in Sydney.

===Continuation of travel in different trains===

Ormskirk railway station in Lancashire, United Kingdom, was a double-track railway until 1970, when it was converted into single-track railway with the track split in the centre by buffer stops placed back-to-back. The two ends of the single platform terminate different routes, and interchange for through service is by walking along the platform.

Another peculiar configuration exists at Pittsburg/Bay Point station on the BART system in the San Francisco Bay area, California, United States. Mainline BART trains terminate at that station, but onward service is available via an eBART diesel multiple unit (DMU) train. At this station, eBART trains are only accessible through a cross-platform transfer at a dedicated platform east of the main station platform. Despite this transfer, the Yellow Line is mapped and signed as one continuous route.
Konggangxinchengjiangning station of Nanjing Metro, China is also a cross-platform terminal station for both Line S1 and S7, with a single island platform and crossovers set at both ends of station, letting trains of both lines to switch back.

Zhongli railway station in Taoyuan, Taiwan has a proposed cross-platform terminal plan for both Taoyuan Airport MRT and Green line of Taoyuan Metro. The station layout will be composed of two island platform, between which a connecting zone set to integrated the two into a single &quot;large platform&quot;. Buffer stops will also be placed back-to back between Airport-bound trains and Green Line trains. The scheme is scheduled to complete in 2031.

==Service levels of connections==

In some, but not all, cases, the trains are coordinated in the timetable.

===Noncoordinated===
In this case, the cross-platform infrastructure offers the possibility of easily changing trains, independently from the waiting time for the second train. In metro systems with short headways, typical waiting time is small, but such a noncoordinated approach could reduce the advantages of stairless cross-platform interchange in railway networks with sparser train traffic.

===Coordinated===
A more-advanced approach involves the coordination of the lines&#x27; timetables to reduce the scheduled changing time, either from one line to the other, or ideally bidirectionally, between both trains simultaneously. Coordinated interchange is widely used in Dutch, German, and Swiss railway networks, where trains of different lines meet at the same platforms in numerous hubs all over the country.

===Optimised, with connection guarantee===
Most advanced are coordinated cross-platform interchanges wherein interconnected trains also wait for each other, to &quot;guarantee&quot; scheduled interchanges even in the event of modest delays. To limit schedule disruption propagation throughout the entire network, additional waiting time for trains is usually limited to a certain period of time, depending on general network performance, further connections to be guaranteed, train category, train line, and a balanced consideration of other factors.

In practice, most railways coordinating cross-platform interchanges define a certain waiting time window for each guaranteed interchange. Some railway operators will briefly delay train departure signals to allow imminently arriving passengers time to interchange. For example, the Vienna U-Bahn metro signals train drivers to wait briefly, by operating a special white light signal triggered by the approach of an interchange train on another track.

==Example interchanges==
In most cases, only cross-platform interchanges used for both directions of travel are listed, with some exceptions.

===Asia===

==== Bangkok ====

Siam Station allows for a cross-platform transfer between the Sukhumvit line and the Silom line, both operated by the BTS, for trains heading in the same direction. Eastbound trains use the lower-level island platform, while the westbound trains depart from the upper-level platforms.

====Beijing====
Guogongzhuang station offers cross-platform interchange between Line 9 and Fangshan Line. National Library station offers cross-platform interchange between Lines 4 and 9. In addition Nanluoguxiang station (Lines 6 and 8), Zhuxinzhuang station (Changping Line and Line 8), Beijing West railway station (Lines 7 and 9), Yancun East station (Fangshan Line and Yanfang Line) offer cross-platform interchange.

====Chengdu====
Xipu Station in Chengdu provides cross-platform interchange between Line 2 of Chengdu Metro and Chengdu–Dujiangyan Intercity Railway of the national rail transport system. It is the first implementation of cross-platform interchanges between different train categories in China. Metro-only cross-platform interchanges exist between Lines 2 and 4 at Chengdu University of TCM &amp; Sichuan Provincial People&#x27;s Hospital station, between Lines 5 and 6 at Xibeiqiao station and outbound direction interchanges between Lines 3 and 10 at Taipingyuan station.

====Chongqing====
Line 5 and Line 6 of the Chongqing Rail Transit offer a paired cross-platform interchange for passengers transferring among four directions between the two lines at Ranjiaba and Dalongshan stations. Same-direction cross-platform interchanges are also provided at Chongqing West Station between Line 5 and Loop line, Baoshuigang between Line 4 and Line 9, Shangwanlu between Line 10 and Line 9 and Wangjiazhuang between Line 6 (International Expo Branch) and Line 10. Meanwhile, an opposite-direction cross-platform interchange is provided at Jiangbeicheng between Line 6 and Line 9.

Aside from these, Min&#x27;an Ave. between Loop line and Line 4 is an exception. Due to the fact that Line 4 only uses one side of the platforms at this station, there formed a half cross-platform interchange.

====Dalian====
The Dalian Metro has a cross platform interchange between Line 1 and Line 12 at Hekou Station.

====Delhi====
The Delhi Metro has 4 cross-platform interchanges in total. These are located at the following stations:- 
*Central Secretariat: Underground interchange between the Yellow Line and Violet Line
*Yamuna Bank: At-grade interchange between Line 3 (Main line) and Line 4 (Branch line) of the Blue Line
*Anand Vihar: Elevated interchange between Line 4 (Branch line) of the Blue Line and Pink Line 
*Botanical Garden: Elevated interchange between Line 3 (Main line) of the Blue Line and Magenta Line

==== Fuzhou ====
Fuzhou Metro&#x27;s Difengjiang station offers a cross-platform transfer between Line 4 and Line 5 and Liangcuo station between Line 1 and Line 6.

====Guangzhou====
Guangzhou Metro offers three two way cross-platform interchanges by 2016, between Line 2 and Line 3 at Jiahewanggang station, between Line 8 and the Guangfo Line at Shayuan station, Between Line 22 and 18 at Panyu Square station and one between both branches of Line 3 at Tiyu Xilu station. At Tiyu Xilu Station the northern section of Line 3 terminates at the center track serving both island platforms connecting to the southern section of Line 3 stopping at the outer tracks. In 2016, a same-direction cross platform interchange started operating between the westbound Line 7 and northbound Line 2 trains at Guangzhou South Railway Station. Several cross platform interchanges are under construction across the network including Chishajiao Station (Line 11 and 12), Tangxi Station (Line 12 and 28), Caihongqiao station (Line 13 and 11), Tianhe Park station (Line 11 and 21).

====Hangzhou====
Hangzhou Metro&#x27;s East Railway Station and Pengbu station offer paired cross-platform interchange between Line 1 and Line 4 and another paired cross-platform interchange at West Lake Cultural Square and Wulin Square stations between Line 1 and Line 3. Same-direction cross-platform interchange is offered between Line 2 and Line 4 at Qianjiang Road station, Coach Center between Line 1 and Line 9, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University station between Lines 4 and Line 6, Xintiandi Street station between Line 3 and Line 4.

====Hong Kong====


In the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system, cross-platform interchange stations first appeared at Mong Kok and Prince Edward stations in Kowloon when Tsuen Wan line was opened and took over the southern half of the Modified Initial System. The interchange is two platforms in sequence, with an opposite-direction cross-platform interchange assigned to Prince Edward and a same-direction interchange to Mong Kok, as large volumes of traffic had been anticipated in both modes.

Popular with passengers, this design was repeated on Admiralty station when the Island line in Victoria was opened to deal with anticipated heavy opposite-direction interchange ridership. Years later, another interchange spanning Tiu Keng Leng station (same direction) in the New Territories and Yau Tong station (opposite direction) in New Kowloon was built to the same configuration as the earlier Mong Kok and Prince Edward interchanges.

The Ma On Shan line is specifically designed to follow right-hand traffic rules (unlike other railway lines in Hong Kong), to enable a same-direction cross-platform interchange at Tai Wai station to the East Rail line while keeping the two southbound platforms connected via ramps.

Another configuration found in Lai King station makes commuting in both directions more convenient by aligning both tracks leading towards the city next to each other on one level, and both tracks leading away from city next to each other on another level. The configuration for North Point station is similar, to provide convenience for passengers traveling inbound, although the distance between the two platforms is longer compared to other stations.

Before the MTR–KCR merger in 2007, Nam Cheong station was served by MTR&#x27;s Tung Chung line and KCR&#x27;s West Rail line. Due to the different fare systems, platforms of southbound Tung Chung Line and northbound West Rail were separated by barriers despite being at the same elevation, and interconnecting passageways were regulated with one instead of two sets of ticketing barriers. After the merger, some sections of the barrier were demolished in order to provide free cross-platform interchange between southbound Tung Chung Line and northbound West Rail line trains. However, this arrangement does not serve the dominant rush hour passenger flows, which are between New Territories and Hong Kong Island, as well as between Lantau Island and Tsim Sha Tsui.

To connect East Rail and West Rail lines at Hung Hom without through-running, both lines were in the past terminated in the south there, alternating on both East/West Rail platforms to offer cross-platform interchanges.

At Sunny Bay, passengers on the Tung Chung line from the city can make a cross-platform interchange to a train. However, the inverse is not the case, so passengers returning to the city from Hong Kong Disneyland need to use an overpass to catch a Hong Kong-bound train.

====Kuala Lumpur====

 offers cross-platform interchange between Sri Petaling Line (Line 4) and Kelana Jaya Line (Line 5) while offers cross-platform interchange between Ampang Line (Line 3) and Sri Petaling Line (Line 4). Tun Razak Exchange and Kwasa Damansara also offers cross-platform interchange between MRT Kajang Line and the MRT Putrajaya Line.

====Kyoto====
There is a cross-platform interchange between the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line and the Keihan Keishin Line at .

====Nanjing====
Nanjing Metro&#x27;s Nanjing South Railway Station offers cross-platform interchange between Lines 1 and 3 and same-direction cross-platform interchange between Line S1 and Line S3. In addition, a cross platform interchange is available at Xiangyulunan Station between Line S1 and Line S9, and Konggangxinchengjiangning Station between Line S1 and Line S7.

====Nanning====
A paired cross platform interchange is available between Line 1 and Line 2 at Nanning railway station and Chaoyang Square station.

====Osaka====
The Osaka Metro has a cross-platform interchange between the Midosuji Line and the Yotsubashi Line at Daikokuchō, where the platforms are at the same level.

Kintetsu Railway also has a cross-platform interchange between the Nara Line and the Osaka Line at Tsuruhashi, where the platforms are at the same level.

Hanshin Railway has a same direction cross-platform interchange between the Namba Line and Hanshin Main Line at Amagasaki.

====Qingdao====
Cross-platform interchange is available between Line 2 and Line 3 at . Provisions for cross-platform interchange between Line 3 and Line 8 were made at Qingdao North Railway Station.

====Seoul====
Seoul Subway Geumjeong Station offers cross-platform transfer between Line 1 local services and all 4 services. Gimpo Airport Station also offers cross-platform transfer between all Line 9 services and AREX local service. Also several Line 1 stations offer cross-platform transfer between trains heading to Incheon or Cheonan/Sinchang.

====Shanghai====
Oriental Sports Center Station offers cross-platform interchange between Lines 6 and 11. In addition, Hongqiao Railway Station provides cross platform interchange between Lines 2 and 17. While Hongqiao Airport Terminal 2 Station provides a same-direction cross-platform interchange between the Line 2 Pudong International Airport bound trains and Line 10 Xinjiangwancheng bound trains. Shanghai Railway Station and Zhongshan Park also offer cross-platform interchanges between Outer Loop Line 4 trains and Shanghai South Railway Station bound Line 3 trains and Inner Loop Line 4 trains and North Jiangyang Road bound Line 3 trains, as the two lines share a portion of the same track.

====Shenzhen====
Shenzhen metro network includes cross-platform interchanges at Laojie (Lines 1 and 3), Huangbeiling (Lines 2 and 5), Chegongmiao (Lines 7 and 9), Hongshuwan South (Lines 9 and 11), Nanyou (Lines 9 and 12), Huangmugang (Lines 7 and 14), Gangxia North (Lines 11 and 14), and Universiade (Lines 14 and 16) stations. Reservations have been made for future cross platform interchanges at (Lines 14 and 17), Xiangmihu West (Lines 14 and 20), Xinsheng (Lines 3 and 21), and Aobei (Lines 14 and 21) stations.

====Singapore====

The Mass Rapid Transit system in Singapore has a similar two-station transfer arrangement to allow quick transfers between North–South and East–West lines. Both City Hall MRT station and Raffles Place MRT station have double underground island platforms stacked on top the other, allowing commuters to switch trains to a different line by walking across the same platform at the appropriate station.

Jurong East MRT station has a less complicated arrangement, with the terminating rail for the North–South Line aligned between that of the East–West Line, allowing commuters to alight and board simultaneously on either side, with an additional rail for the North–South Line used during peak hours. Tanah Merah MRT station also has a similar arrangement, with the terminating rail for the East West line Changi Airport Extension aligned between the two the East West line platforms, allowing commuters to alight and board simultaneously on either side too.

The Bayfront MRT station is also a cross-platform interchange with double underground island platforms between the Marina Bay branch of the Circle Line and Downtown Line. The original plans for Promenade MRT station contained a similar arrangement but the existing Circle Line tracks to and from Dhoby Ghaut need to be crossed at the same levels by Downtown Line trains. Thus, Bayfront MRT station is the only station on the MRT system which offers cross-platform interchange between two different operators&#x27; MRT lines (SBS Transit operates the Downtown Line whilst SMRT operates the Circle Line).

====Tehran====
Sadeghieh metro station of Tehran metro offers cross-platform interchanges between both terminating metro lines 2 and 5; while suburban line 5 uses the outer tail tracks of each platform, metro line 2 uses one platform for alighting and the other for boarding. Line 2 uses platforms 2 and 3, and Line 5 uses platforms 1 and 4. Eram-e Sabz metro station also has a cross-platform interchange. It has a cross platform interchange between Lines 4 and 5. Line 4 uses platforms 1 and 4, and Line 5 uses platforms 2 and 3.

====Taipei====
The Taipei Metro has four stations for cross-platform interchanges: (between the Songshan–Xindian line and Tamsui–Xinyi line), (between the Songshan–Xindian line and Bannan line), (between the Songshan–Xindian line and the Zhonghe–Xinlu line) and (between Zhonghe–Xinlu line and the Tamsui–Xinyi line). All these stations have two island platforms on different floors, most of them are same-direction cross-platform configuration except Dongmen Station which has an inverse cross-platform.

Beitou Station allows for cross-platform transfers for southbound trains only due to differing operating routes.

====Tokyo====

In the Tokyo Metro, Akasaka-mitsuke Station provides cross-platform transfer between Ginza Line and Marunouchi Line.

At Omotesandō Station, transfer between Ginza Line and Hanzōmon Line can be done on its two island platforms at the same level. Shirokane-takanawa Station uses the same way to offer cross-platform interchange between Namboku Line and Mita Line.

At Kudanshita Station, cross-platform interchange is possible between a Shinjuku bound Shinjuku Line train and an Oshiage bound Hanzōmon Line train.

In Shinjuku Station, transfers between JR East&#x27;s Yamanote Line and Chūō–Sōbu Line use directional cross-platform interchange on two parallel island platforms. Between and , there are cross-platform interchanges between the Yamanote Line and the Keihin-Tohoku Line. At Ochanomizu Station, there is a cross-platform interchange between the Chūō–Sōbu Line and the Chūō Rapid Line.

In the Tokyu Railway network at Ōokayama Station, cross platform interchange is provided between the Meguro Line and the Ōimachi Line. In addition Naka-Meguro Station provides cross platform interchange is available between the Tōkyū Tōyoko Line and Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line, and Futako-Tamagawa Station provides a cross platform interchange between the Tōkyū Den-en-toshi Line and Tōkyū Ōimachi Line.

====Wuhan====

Line 2 and Line 4 of Wuhan Metro&#x27;s Hongshan Square station and Zhongnan Road station offer paired cross-platform interchange for passengers transferring among four directions of the two lines. Two more cross platform interchanges opened in Wuhan at Zhongjiacun station between Line 4 and Line 6, and Hongtu Boulevard station between Line 2 and Line 3.

====Zhengzhou====
A number of cross platform interchanges are reserved across the system with Shibalihe station reserving same direction cross-platform interchange between Line 2 and Line 9 (Chengjiao line), Zhengzhou East Railway Station reserves same direction cross-platform interchange between Line 5 and Line 8, Zhangjiacun station reserves same direction cross-platform interchange between Line 4 and Line 7 and Yaozhuang station reserves same direction cross-platform interchange between Line 4 and Line 16.

===Europe===
====Amsterdam====
Amsterdam metro network includes cross-platform interchanges at Van der Madeweg station between metro lines 50 and 53 and at Amsterdam South station between metro lines 50 and 52. Further, cross-platform connections are offered at Amstel station between metro lines 51, 53, 54 and suburban and intercity services of Netherlands Railways.

====Barcelona====

The Barcelona Metro has a cross-platform transfer between L2 and L3 at Paral·lel station.

====Berlin====
The Berlin suburban rail network includes cross-platform transfers at Berlin East and at Baumschulenweg / Schöneweide, Bornholmer Straße, Gesundbrunnen, Treptower Park and Wannsee suburban railway stations.

Berlin metro services offer cross-platform connections at Mehringdamm (metro lines U6/U7), Nollendorfplatz (metro line U4 with outbound lines U1/U3) and Wittenbergplatz (metro lines U2/U3, outbound also U1) metro stations.

Additionally, Wuhletal station offers cross-platform interchanges between lines S5 of Berlin suburban rail and U5 of Berlin metro.

Jungfernheide metro station was built for cross-platform interchanges between line U7 and an extended line U5 towards Tegel Airport; the extension plan was abandoned following the decision to replace Tegel Airport with Berlin Brandenburg Airport. A part of one of the U5 tunnels is used by Berlin firefighters for fire and rescue training in a metro tunnel with an original train taken out-of-service. Similar provisions were also made at Schloßstraße metro station for cross-platform interchanges between line U9 and a never realised line U10.

====Bochum====
In Bochum&#x27;s light rail and tram network (operated by Bogestra), a cross-platform interchange is offered at Bochum Hauptbahnhof (Bochum Main Railway Station) between light rail line U35 and sub-surface tram lines 302 and 310 on the lower level of the underground light rail station complex. U35 and 302/310 services to the south and southeast, and to the north and north-east stop at the same platforms.

====Brussels====
Brussels South railway station offers an interesting example of double-level cross-platform interchange, where the goal is to make it easier for passengers to &quot;double back&quot;. The metro and premetro lines interweave so that, for example, one can arrive on the metro 2 or 6 from the north-east, walk across the island platform, and catch a tram 3 or 4 going south-east. Passengers making this journey in the opposite direction use the level below. Similar cross-platform interchanges offers Beekkant station between metro lines 1/5 and 2/6; in this area, lines 1/5 run on the right while lines 2/6 run on the left due to historical layout when formerly line 1B between Herrmann Debroux and Roi Baudoin stations branched off line 1B (running between Stockel and Erasme stations) and line 1A needed to change driving direction at Beekkant station. At Brussels North premetro station cross platform interchange is offered between tram lines 25 and 55 coming from Schaerbeek to the premetro lines 3 and 4 towards the city center.

==== Bucharest ====
Basarab station of metro lines M1 and M4 is the only cross-platform interchange in the Bucharest metro network where lines cross each other.

==== Charleroi ====
The Charleroi light rail system includes two stations, Beaux-Arts and Waterloo, with possible cross-platform interchanges.

==== Cologne ====
The only cross-platform interchange of the Cologne premetro network is Ebertplatz station, where passengers can change easily between high and low floor lines sharing an island platform for each direction.

==== Copenhagen ====
The Copenhagen suburban network contains cross-platform interchanges between circle line F and lines B, C, E at Hellerup station.

==== Duisburg ====
Duisburg premetro network includes two cross-platform interchange stations, Duisburg Hauptbahnhof (Duisburg Main Railway Station) for same-direction interchange and König-Heinrich-Platz station for opposite-direction interchange.

==== Düsseldorf ====
Düsseldorf premetro network contains a four-track route between Düsseldorf Hauptbahnhof (Düsseldorf Main Railway Station) and Heinrich-Heine-Allee station comprising two island platforms for same-direction cross-platform interchange at each station; while at both mentioned stations, the two platforms are located parallel, they are built one above the other at both intermediate stations.

==== Essen ====
Essen premetro network includes two stations with cross-platform interchange on two parallel island platforms at Essen Hauptbahnhof (Essen Main Railway Station) and Essen Rathaus station; cross-platform connections at Essen Hauptbahnhof are between standard-gauge premetro lines and metre-gauge sub-surface tram lines.

==== Frankfurt (Main) ====
At Konstablerwache station, Frankfurt&#x27;s suburban train lines S1 to S6, S8 and S9 and Frankfurt premetro lines U6 and U7 share one island platform for each direction, with the suburban railway (inner) side of the platforms being much longer than for the premetro. Also, the premetro station located at Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof (Frankfurt Main Railway Station) was once designed for cross-platform transfers between different Frankfurt premetro lines but is now only used by premetro lines U4/U5 running along the same corridor.

==== Hamburg ====
Hamburg metro offers cross-platform interchanges at Barmbek (between circle and branch of metro line U3), Berliner Tor (between metro lines U2/U4 and U3), Kellinghusenstraße (between metro lines U1 and U3) and Wandsbek-Gartenstadt (between metro lines U1 and U3) metro stations; all cross-platform interchanges are also timetable coordinated to make it as easy and convenient for the passengers as possible.

Another cross-platform interchange is used at the northwestern terminus of metro line U1 at Norderstedt Mitte station where metros use the outer tracks and interconnect with the non-electrified suburban line A2 of AKN private railway company terminating on the center track in between the two island platforms.

Hamburg suburban railway offers cross-platform interchanges at Altona station and Hamburg Hauptbahnhof (Hamburg Main Railway Station) ensuring short connections for four of five branches to both inner city routes.

==== Hanover ====
Hanover premetro offers two cross-platform interchanges, one at Hannover Hauptbahnhof (Hanover Main Railway Station) and one at Aegidientorplatz station.

==== London ====

In London&#x27;s deep-level tube network, these usually occur in pairs for both directions of two lines. This allows for extremely quick and convenient interchange. The effect is that the two lines, despite having completely separate operation, can be treated by passengers as branches of a single network.

Examples include:
* Several slow and fast services have multiple cross-platform interchanges. Finchley Road offers cross platform transfers between the fast Metropolitan line and slow Jubilee line at surface level before diverging from Wembley Park. Acton Town, Barons Court, Turnham Green and Hammersmith all have cross platform transfers between the fast Piccadilly line and the slow District line.
* Mile End has cross platform transfers between the District/Hammersmith &amp; City and Central lines at sub-surface level.
* Barking has cross platform transfers between District/Hammersmith &amp; City lines and c2c services from platform 3, 4, 5 and 6.
* Stratford has cross platform between the Central line and Elizabeth line services.
* For the deep-level interchanges the term &quot;same level interchange&quot; is sometimes preferred as there is invariably an intermediate circulating area between the platforms. Convenient same level interchanges feature at various Victoria line stations, including Stockwell with the Northern line and Euston with the Bank branch of the Northern line; Oxford Circus with the Bakerloo line; Finsbury Park with the Piccadilly line; and Highbury and Islington with the Northern City Line. There is also a cross platform interchange at Baker Street between the Bakerloo and Jubilee lines, and a cross platform interchange at Kennington between the Charing Cross and Bank branches of the Northern line, which during normal service times operates as two separate branches south of Camden Town.

==== Lisbon ====
The Lisbon Metro has two stations with an island platform and two side platforms (with the island platform being used for same-direction cross-platform interchanges between lines entering downtown Lisbon): Baixa-Chiado (Lisbon Metro) (which has an inbound cross-platform transfer between the Green Line and the Blue Line) and Campo Grande (which has an inbound cross-platform transfer between the Green Line and the Yellow Line). Transfers between trains leaving downtown Lisbon require passengers to change platforms.

Lisbon regional rail has cross-platform interchanges on the belt line within Lisbon as well as on the Sintra line, where Sintra line trains connect with Azambuja line trains.

==== Liverpool ====
Kirkby railway station (until 1977) and Ormskirk railway station (until 1970) were double-track railway, when they were converted into single-track railway with cross-platform interchange.
==== Madrid ====
Madrid Metro uses cross-platform interchanges mainly for easy transfer between urban and suburban sections operated separately on metro lines 7 (Estadio Olimpico), 9 (Puerta de Arganda) and 10 (Tres Olivos). At Casa de Campo station, metro lines 5 and 10 are interconnected cross-platform with line 5 terminating on center track in between the island platforms shared with line 10. At Principe Pio station, metro lines 6 and 10 share an island platform for each direction. Further applications of cross-platform interchanges connect only one direction of each line, for example at Pinar de Chamartín station between metro lines 1 and 4.

==== Milan ====
Cadorna FN station on Milan Metro serves as interchange between M1 and M2 lines (the other one is Loreto). Each line is served by a couple of side platforms located on the same level. This provides a direct link between M1 northbound platform (towards Sesto 1° Maggio) and M2 southbound platform (towards Abbiategrasso or Assago Milanofiori Forum). All the other connections have to be done through the upper level mezzanine.

==== Moscow ====
Some stations in the Moscow Metro utilize cross-platform interchanges. They include Kitay-gorod, Tretyakovskaya and Kashirskaya.

==== Mülheim (Ruhr) ====
Mülheim located roughly in the centre of the Rhein-Ruhr premetro network offers selected cross-platform interchanges at Mülheim (Ruhr) Hauptbahnhof (Mülheim Main Railway Station).

==== Munich ====
Munich metro offers coordinated cross-platform connections at both &quot;Scheidplatz&quot; (metro lines U2/U3) and &quot;Innsbrucker Ring&quot; (metro lines U2/U5) metro stations; all same-direction connections are optimised, so that usually U2 and U3 respectively U5 trains of the same direction arrive, stop and depart at the same time.

&quot;Neuperlach Süd&quot; is a combined station for Munich metro and Munich suburban rail. Original plans intended cross-platform interchanges in both directions at parallel island platforms. However, Munich suburban rail is still single-track there, and offers therefore only cross-platform interchange in the outbound direction and from outbound (terminating) Munich metro U5 services to inbound Munich suburban rail S7 services. Although possible, the arrival and departure times of both lines are not matched together.

Within the Munich S-Bahn (suburban rail) network, &quot;Westkreuz&quot;, &quot;Giesing&quot;, &quot;Berg am Laim&quot; and &quot;Besucherpark&quot; junction stations offer cross-platform interchanges for transfers between both branches. Under discussion are cross-platform interchanges in the same running direction for connecting the central bypass to the existing trunk route at least at &quot;Laim&quot; and &quot;Leuchtenbergring&quot; stations.

At &quot;Donnersbergerbrücke&quot; suburban station, cross-platform interchanges can be made in the same running direction between the S-Bahn lines along the trunk route and lines S7, S27, BOB; although not interconnected by timetables. However, the S-Bahn lines along the trunk route run frequently during most of the day: every 2 to 6 minutes on lines except S7, and every 2 to 4 minutes including the S7.

At &quot;Ostbahnhof&quot;, cross-platform interchanges have been possible since 2004 between regional trains from Rosenheim and Mühldorf to S-Bahn lines towards Ebersberg, Erding and Munich Airport (only in these directions).

Further cross-platform interchanges between Munich S-Bahn and regional trains can be made at &quot;Freising&quot;, &quot;Petershausen&quot;, &quot;Geltendorf&quot;, &quot;Grafing Bahnhof&quot; and &quot;Markt Schwaben&quot; stations, as Munich S-Bahn partly runs on mainline tracks anyway.

==== Nuremberg ====
Nuremberg metro includes one cross-platform interchange between metro lines U1/U11 and U2/U21/U3 at underground Plärrer metro station where the outbound metro platform is located above the inbound.

==== Nizhny Novgorod ====
Nizhny Novgorod metro&#x27;s Moskovskaya station is prepared to offer cross-platform interchanges at a later point of time between both metro lines; before 2012, both lines terminate there and are connected to through running operation eliminating any needs to change trains. After an extension was completed for Line 1 beyond Moskovskaya station, cross-platform interchange was put in use to transfer between both lines.

==== Paris ====
Paris Métro has cross-platform interchange at La Motte-Picquet – Grenelle stations between Paris Métro line 8 and line 10, as well as Louis Blanc (Paris Metro) between Paris Metro Line 7 and Paris Metro Line 7bis.

Paris RER suburban network includes cross-platform interchanges between trains of different lines at several major hubs:
* Châtelet - Les Halles between lines RER A and RER B
* Paris North station between lines RER B and RER D
It also includes cross-platform interchanges between express and local trains at several stations of the RER suburban network:
* RER B at Massy - Palaiseau
* RER E at Val de Fontenay. Its final station Chelles - Gournay also offers cross-platform interchange between local RER E trains and express Transilien P trains.

==== Rhine-Ruhr area ====
The suburban services in the German Rhine-Ruhr area include cross-platform interchanges at Dortmund-Dorstfeld station between lines S2 and S4 (including coordinated timetables), at Düsseldorf Hauptbahnhof and at Essen Hauptbahnhof.

For information about the Rhine-Ruhr Stadtbahn (premetro) network, see among the related cities (Bochum, Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Essen, Mülheim).

==== St. Petersburg ====
Tekhnologichesky Institut offers cross-platform interchange between lines 1 and 2.

Sportivnaya will have a cross-platform interchange between lines 5 and 8, but line 8 is not built yet.

==== Stockholm ====
Stockholm Metro includes cross-platform interchanges at T-Centralen (Main Railway Station), Gamla stan and Slussen metro stations between red and green metro lines, where T-Centralen (Main Railway Station) offers opposite-direction connections while the latter two make cross-platform connections possible in the same direction. Additionally, passengers between Nockebybanan and green metro lines can change cross-platform at Alvik station. Södertälje Hamn railway station on the Stockholm commuter rail network provides optimised transfer between the J40, J41 and J48 lines.

==== Vienna ====
Vienna metro optimised cross-platform connections at Längenfeldgasse station between lines U4 and U6 by demanding trains to wait as soon as the connecting train is approaching in case of delays or during different train intervals operated; this additional functionality is carried out by a special white light signal demanding the driver to wait. Before line U2 was extended from Schottenring further east, U2 trains terminated at (upper) U4 platform level on a center track sharing platforms with U4 trains on both sides; originally, this station level had been used for merging U2 and U4 lines and consisted of 4 tracks with 2 island platforms, but both platforms were merged to a single island platform after U2 extension opened.

==== Weesp ====
The Weesp railway station railway lines towards Amsterdam Centraal station and Schiphol railway station to the west and Hilversum and Flevoland to the east come together, and offer a cross-platform transfer in the same cardinal directions, with train arrival times coördinated. Because local trains are overtaken by intercity trains (who do not stop here), local trains stand at the station a long time (sometimes 11 minutes scheduled, on trains with a 15mn headway).

===North America===

==== Boston ====
An inbound-only cross-platform transfer is provided between the MBTA Orange Line and Green Line at North Station. Outbound transfers must be done by changing levels. There is another cross-platform interchange at Kenmore so riders can transfer among the different Green Line branches.

==== Chicago ====
In the Chicago &quot;L&quot; metro network, Howard, Wilson, Belmont, and Fullerton stations offer cross-platform interchange in the same direction between different services on the North Side Main Line. All stations are served by the Red Line at all times and by the Purple Line at peak times; the Brown Line and Yellow Line also serve some of these stations.

==== Jersey City and Newark ====

The PATH system, serving the New York metropolitan area, contains cross-platform interchanges in Jersey City and Newark, New Jersey. At Journal Square Transportation Center in Jersey City, there is a cross-platform transfer between terminating Journal Square–33rd Street and Journal Square–33rd Street (via Hoboken) trains, connecting to through Newark–World Trade Center trains. At Pennsylvania Station in Newark, there is a cross-platform interchange between Newark–World Trade Center and NJ Transit trains bound for New York City. Newark Penn Station also contains a cross-platform interchange for NJ Transit trains coming from New York City.

A paid cross-platform connection exists between the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) rapid transit system and Amtrak and NJT trains at Newark Penn Station, allowing passengers to switch to trains to the World Trade Center.

==== Montreal ====

Two transfer stations in Montreal feature cross-platform interchange. At the Lionel-Groulx station, the upper platforms serve Henri-Bourassa or Montmorency (Orange Line 2) and Honoré-Beaugrand (Green Line 1) trains, &quot;entering&quot; downtown; the lower platforms serve Côte-Vertu (Orange Line 2) and Angrignon (Green Line 1) trains, &quot;leaving&quot; downtown. Since most transferring passengers are either entering or leaving downtown, most transfers at this station are cross-platform.

At the Snowdon station, however, the outbound Orange Line platforms are at the same level as the Blue Line terminal platform, with the inbound Orange Line platforms linked to the Blue Line departure platform, reducing efficiency. This is explained because the Blue Line was originally planned to be continued west of the station, in which case this arrangement would have provided the same benefit as the arrangement at Lionel-Groulx.

==== New York City ====

The New York City Subway has many three- or four-track lines with local and express service. Cross-platform interchanges are located in numerous locations throughout the system to allow for convenient transfers between express and local trains. In general, express trains run on the inner pair of tracks and bypass local-only stations, while local trains run on the outer pair of tracks and stop at every station. Express stations typically have island platforms between the express and local tracks, allowing passengers to quickly switch between trains heading in the same direction simply by crossing a platform.

In addition to the very common express-local interchanges, the New York City Subway also has several cross-platform interchanges between lines that do not share a three- or four-track right-of-way:
* The Queensboro Plaza station contains a same-directional cross-platform transfer between the IRT Flushing Line () and BMT Astoria Line ().
* The Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets and Jay Street–MetroTech stations in Brooklyn allow cross-platform interchanges between the of the IND Crosstown Line with the of the IND Fulton Street Line, the of the IND Culver Line, respectively.
* At the Seventh Avenue–53rd Street station, there is a feature unique to the system, as anti-directional cross-platform interchanges can be made here (albeit between trains heading in the same general cardinal direction, due to the track layout near the station).
* The DeKalb Avenue and Prospect Park stations on the BMT Brighton Line () in Brooklyn feature cross-platform interchanges to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line () and the BMT Franklin Avenue Line (), respectively.
* The Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station in Manhattan has a cross-platform interchange between the two 63rd Street Lines ().

The Jamaica hub station of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) features cross-platform interchanges among the many services that stop there. 

The LIRR&#x27;s electrified Ronkonkoma Branch extends over non-electrified tracks to Greenport station with diesel trains, requiring a transfer. At Ronkonkoma, the two tracks are served by side platforms for passengers wanting to get off at this station, and an island platform for passengers transferring between trains. Trains use the spanish solution, opening doors on both sides.

==== Philadelphia ====
SEPTA&#x27;s Broad Street Line has cross-platform interchanges between local and express trains at Olney Transportation Center, Erie, Girard, Spring Garden, Race-Vine, City Hall, and Walnut–Locust station.

==== San Francisco Bay Area ====
Three adjacent Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) stations – , , and – have cross-platform transfers between northbound and trains, with 19th Street Oakland as the designated timed transfer point. MacArthur additionally has a southbound timed transfer for the same lines.

A cross-platform transfer also exists at between the northbound Caltrain platform and one of the BART platforms. East of , there is a dedicated transfer platform between the main BART system and eBART, for continuation of travel inbound or outbound.

==== Vancouver ====
In December 2016, Lougheed Town Centre station on the Vancouver SkyTrain was expanded to a 3-track, 2-platform station in preparation for the beginning of service on the Evergreen Extension. For the first 18 months of service on the Evergreen Extension, the third platform served eastbound trains while the southern half of the island platform served westbound trains (with Millennium Line trains running left-handed through the station); this measure allowed a same-direction cross-platform transfer between Millennium Line trains headed to VCC–Clark and Expo Line trains headed to Waterfront (via Columbia). On 25 June 2018, normal right-hand running of Millennium Line trains through the station resumed, making it possible to do an anti-directional cross-platform transfer between Expo Line trains headed for Production Way–University and Millennium Line trains headed to Lafarge Lake–Douglas.

===Oceania===

==== Auckland ====
At Newmarket Station, there are three lines serving two island platforms. Western Line services use the centre line (which can serve both platforms) allowing cross-platform interchange with Southern Line services which use the outer lines.

==== Adelaide ====
Adelaide Metro offers cross-platform interchanges between the Outer Harbor line and Grange line at Woodville for outbound services only.

==== Brisbane ====
Cross-platform interchanges are offered between Ipswich and Rosewood services at Ipswich, and between outbound express Gold Coast line and stopping Beenleigh line services at Altandi station.

==== Melbourne ====
Melbourne&#x27;s suburban railway offers cross-platform interchanges along the City Loop according to the operation concept, and depending on time and day. All three underground stations consist of four tracks and two island platforms one above each other.

Burnley Group passengers can change between Flinders Street direct and City Loop services at Richmond station on weekday mornings, and between stopping and limited express services at Burnley station.

Camberwell station operates as a partial cross-platform interchange off-peak, when Alamein services operate as shuttles from Camberwell. During the day, terminating trains from Alamein drop passengers off (before proceeding to a reversing track west of the station) on platform 2, which connects to a city-bound Belgrave/Lilydale line train on platform 1. At night, trains from Alamein terminate and reverse on platform 1, allowing cross-platform transfers for passengers from the city arriving on platform 2 on a Belgrave/Lilydale service.

==== Perth ====

The Transperth Trains network offers cross-platform interchanges between
the Midland line and
the Armadale/Thornlie lines at both
McIver and
Claisebrook stations,
but only when transferring from the Midland line to the Armadale/Thornlie lines.
There is no cross-platform interchange in the opposite direction.

==== Sydney ====
The Sydney Trains suburban railway system offers cross-platform interchange at Central between express and local trains to/from Strathfield as well as on the four-track section from Westmead to St Marys along the Western Line, each in the same direction. Selected cross-platform interchanges can also be made at Campbelltown, Central, Glenfield, Granville, Hornsby, Lidcombe, Redfern, Regents Park, Revesby, Sydenham and Town Hall.

Cross-platform interchange is also available between Sydney Metro and Sydney Trains services at Chatswood.

===South America===

==== Buenos Aires ====
Plaza Miserere provided cross transfer interchange between subway line A and suburban railroad line Sarmiento. There is a never used cross-platform interchange between lines A and D at Plaza de Mayo station and three abandoned cross-platform interchanges: at Primera Junta station between line A and the former tram service towards Lacarra avenue and at San José station on line E between the branch going to Bolívar station and the closed branch to Constitución station where another cross-platform interchange was provided between lines C and E.
Suburban lines Sarmiento, San Martín and Roca offers many cross-platform interchanges between express and local services on their 4 track stretches.

==== Santiago de Chile ====
Vicuña Mackenna metro station is the only in the metro network of Santiago de Chile offering cross-platform transfer; the through-running line 4 and its shuttle line 4A are interconnected cross-platform here. Line 4A uses the center track between both island platforms, with line 4 stopping on the outer tracks.

==== São Paulo ====
Four stations of São Paulo metro and train network offer cross-platform interchange: Paraíso, between lines 1 (towards Jabaquara) and 2 (towards Vila Madalena), Brás, between lines 10 (towards Rio Grande da Serra) and 11 (towards Luz), Osasco, where line 9 terminates at a center track between two islands platforms serving line 8, and Presidente Altino, also between lines 8 and 9 where the latter uses the inner tracks, the northernmost island platform serves westbound trains (to Itapevi and Osasco), and the southernmost island platform serves eastbound trains (to Júlio Prestes and Grajaú).

At Luz, when &quot;Service 710&quot; is running (through service between lines 7 and 10), cross-platform interchange is also available between alighting-only line 11&#x27;s trains (which terminates here before relaying) and southbound trains to Rio Grande da Serra. When &quot;Service 710&quot; is not running, cross-platform interchange is done with line 7 southbound trains to Brás, which is also served by line 11 eastbound trains to Estudantes.

<text>A cochlear implant (CI) is a surgically implanted neuroprosthesis that provides a person who has moderate-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss with sound perception. With the help of therapy, cochlear implants may allow for improved speech understanding in both quiet and noisy environments. A CI bypasses acoustic hearing by direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. Through everyday listening and auditory training, cochlear implants allow both children and adults to learn to interpret those signals as speech and sound.

The implant has two main components. The outside component is generally worn behind the ear, but could also be attached to clothing, for example, in young children. This component, the sound processor, contains microphones, electronics that include digital signal processor (DSP) chips, battery, and a coil that transmits a signal to the implant across the skin. The inside component, the actual implant, has a coil to receive signals, electronics, and an array of electrodes which is placed into the cochlea, which stimulate the cochlear nerve.

The surgical procedure is performed under general anesthesia. Surgical risks are minimal and most individuals will undergo outpatient surgery and go home the same day. However, some individuals will experience dizziness, and on rare occasions, tinnitus or facial nerve bruising.

From the early days of implants in the 1970s and the 1980s, speech perception via an implant has steadily increased. More than 200,000 people in the United States had received a CI through 2019. Many users of modern implants gain reasonable to good hearing and speech perception skills post-implantation, especially when combined with lipreading. One of the challenges that remain with these implants is that hearing and speech understanding skills after implantation show a wide range of variation across individual implant users. Factors such as age of implantation, parental involvement and education level, duration and cause of hearing loss, how the implant is situated in the cochlea, the overall health of the cochlear nerve, and individual capabilities of re-learning are considered to contribute to this variation.

==History==

André Djourno and Charles Eyriès invented the original cochlear implant in 1957. Their design distributed stimulation using a single channel.

William House also invented a cochlear implant in 1961. In 1964, Blair Simmons and Robert L. White implanted a single-channel electrode in a patient&#x27;s cochlea at Stanford University. However, research indicated that these single-channel cochlear implants were of limited usefulness because they cannot stimulate different areas of the cochlea at different times to allow differentiation between low and mid to high frequencies as required for detecting speech.

The next step in the development of the CI was its clinical trial on a cohort of patients. In the late 1960&#x27;s Robin Michelson and colleague Melvin Bartz construct a cochlear device with biocompatible materials that can be implanted in human patients. This system is implanted in 4 patients, and the report of the hearing results represent a watershed for clinically applicable cochlear implants. Robin Michelson, Robert Schindler, and Michael Merzenich at the University of California, San Francisco, conducted these experiments in 1970 and 1971. Michelson, a clinical pioneer, and Merzenich, a talented basic scientist with a solid foundation in neurophysiology, was an integral element in the development of the UCSF cochlear implant team. Michelson was recognized for implanting a single-channel device into a congenitally deaf woman. She demonstrated auditory sensations from stimulation, as well as pitch perception for stimulus frequencies less that 600 Hz. Unfortunately, This patient had no word recognition. His pioneering work was presented, but not well-received at the 1971 annual meeting of the American Otological Society (Michelson, 1971 and Merzenich et al., 1973). In 1973, the first international conference on the &quot;electrical stimulation of the acoustic nerve as a treatment for profound sensorineural deafness in man&quot; was organized in San Francisco. 

NASA engineer Adam Kissiah started working in the mid-1970s on what would become the modern cochlear implant. Kissiah used his knowledge learned while working as an electronics instrumentation engineer for NASA. This work took place over three years, when Kissiah would spend his lunch breaks and evenings in Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s technical library, studying the impact of engineering principles on the inner ear. In 1977, NASA helped Kissiah obtain a patent for the cochlear implant; Kissiah later sold the patent rights.

The modern multi-channel cochlear implant was independently developed and commercialized by two separate teams—one led by Graeme Clark in Australia and another by Ingeborg Hochmair and her future husband, Erwin Hochmair in Austria, with the Hochmairs&#x27; device first implanted in a person in December 1977 and Clark&#x27;s in August 1978.

==Parts==
Cochlear implants bypass most of the peripheral auditory system which receives sound and converts that sound into movements of hair cells in the cochlea; the deflection of stereocilia causes an influx of potassium ions into the hair cells, and the depolarisation in turn stimulates calcium influx, which increases release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Excitation of the cochlear nerve by the neurotransmitter sends signals to the brain, which creates the experience of sound. With an implant, instead, the devices pick up sound and digitize it, convert that digitized sound into electrical signals, and transmit those signals to electrodes embedded in the cochlea. The electrodes electrically stimulate the cochlear nerve, causing it to send signals to the brain.

There are several systems available, but generally they have the following components:

External:

* one or more microphones that pick up sound from the environment
* a speech processor which selectively filters sound to prioritize audible speech
* a transmitter that sends power and the processed sound signals across the skin to the internal device by radio frequency transmission

Internal:

* a receiver/stimulator, which receives signals from the speech processor and converts them into electric impulses
* an electrode array embedded in the cochlea
A totally implantable cochlear implant (TICI) is currently in development. This new type of cochlear implant incorporates all the current external components of an audio processor into the internal implant. The lack of external components makes the implant invisible from the outside and also means it is less likely to be damaged or broken.
=== Assistive listening devices ===
Most modern cochlear implants can be used with a range of assistive listening devices (ALDs), which help people to hear better in challenging listening situations. These situations could include talking on the phone, watching TV or listening to a speaker or teacher. With an ALD, the sound from devices including mobile phones or from an external microphone is sent to the audio processor directly, rather than being picked up by the audio processor&#x27;s microphone. This direct transmission improves the sound quality for the user, making it easier to talk on the phone or stream music.

ALDs come in many forms, such as , pens, and specialist battery pack covers. Modern ALDs are usually able to receive sound from any Bluetooth device, including phones and computers, before transmitting it wirelessly to the audio processor. Most cochlear implants are also compatible with older ALD technology, such as a telecoil.

==Surgical procedure==

=== Surgical techniques ===
Implantation of children and adults can be done safely with few surgical complications and most individuals will undergo outpatient surgery and go home the same day.

Occasionally, the very young, the very old, or patients with a significant number of medical diseases at once may remain for overnight observation in the hospital. The procedure can be performed in an ambulatory surgery center in healthy individuals.

The surgical procedure most often used to implant the device is called mastoidectomy with facial recess approach (MFRA).

The procedure is usually done under general anesthesia. Complications of the procedure are rare, but include mastoiditis, otitis media (acute or with effusion), shifting of the implanted device requiring a second procedure, damage to the facial nerve, damage to the chorda tympani, and wound infections.

Cochlear implantation surgery is considered a clean procedure with an infection rate of less than 3%. Guidelines suggest that routine prophylactic antibiotics are not required. However, the potential cost of a postoperative infection is high (including the possibility of implant loss); therefore, a single preoperative intravenous injection of antibiotics is recommended.

The rate of complications is about 12% for minor complications and 3% for major complications; major complications include infections, facial paralysis, and device failure.

Although up to 20 new cases of post-CI bacterial meningitis occur annually worldwide, data demonstrates a reducing incidence. To avoid the risk of bacterial meningitis, the CDC recommends that adults and children undergoing CI receive age-appropriate vaccines that generate antibodies to Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The rate of transient facial nerve palsy is estimated to be approximately 1%. Device failure requiring reimplantation is estimated to occur 2.5–6% of the time. Up to one-third of people experience disequilibrium, vertigo, or vestibular weakness lasting more than one week after the procedure; in people under 70 these symptoms generally resolve over weeks to months, but in people over 70 the problems tend to persist.

In the past, cochlear implants were only approved for people who were deaf in both ears; a cochlear implant had been used experimentally in some people who had acquired deafness in one ear after they had learned how to speak, and none who were deaf in one ear from birth; clinical studies had been too small to draw generalizations.

=== Alternative surgical technique ===
Other approaches, such as going through the suprameatal triangle, are used. A systematic literature review published in 2016 found that studies comparing the two approaches were generally small, not randomized, and retrospective so were not useful for making generalizations; it is not known which approach is safer or more effective.

=== Endoscopic cochlear implantation ===
With the increased utilization of endoscopic ear surgery as popularized by professor Tarabichi, there have been multiple published reports on the use of endoscopic technique in cochlear implant surgery. However, this has been motivated by marketing and there is clear indication of increased morbidity associated with this technique as reported by the pioneer of endoscopic ear surgery.

=== Complications of cochlear implant surgery ===
As cochlear implant surgical techniques have advanced over the last four decades, the global complication rate for CI surgery in both children and adults has decreased from more than 35% in 1991 to less than 10% at present. The risk of postoperative facial nerve injury has also decreased over the last several decades to less than 1%, most of which demonstrated complete return of function within six months. The rate of permanent paralysis is approximately 1 per 1,000 surgeries and likely less than that in experienced CI centers.

The majority of complications following CI surgery are minor requiring only conservative medical management or prolongation of hospital stay. Less than 5% of all complications are major resulting in surgical intervention or readmission to the hospital. Reported rates of revision cochlear implant surgery vary in adults and children from 3.8% to 8% with the most common indications being device failure, infection, and migration of the implant or electrode. Disequilibrium and vertigo after CI surgery can occur but the symptoms tend to be mild and short-lived. CI rarely results in significant or persistent adverse effects on the vestibular system when hearing conservation surgical techniques are practiced. Moreover, gait and postural stability may actually improve post-implantation.

== Outcomes ==
Cochlear implant outcomes can be measured using speech recognition ability and functional improvements measured using patient reported outcome measures. While the degree of improvement after cochlear implantation may vary, the majority of patients who receive cochlear implants demonstrate a significant improvement in speech recognition ability compared to their preoperative condition.

Multiple meta-analyses of the literature from 2018 showed that CI users have large improvements in quality of life after cochlear implantation. This improvement occurs in many different facets of life that extends beyond communication including improved ability to engage in social activities; decreased mental effort from listening; and improved environmental sound awareness. Deaf adolescents with cochlear implants attending mainstream educational settings report high levels of scholastic self-esteem, friendship self-esteem, and global self-esteem. They also tend to hold mostly positive attitudes towards their cochlear implants, and as a part of their identity, a majority either do &quot;not really think about&quot; their hearing loss, or are &quot;proud of it.&quot; Though advancements in cochlear implant technology have helped patients in their understanding of language, users are still unable to understand suprasegmental portions of language, which includes pitch.

A study by Johns Hopkins University determined that for a three-year-old child who receives them, cochlear implants can save $30,000 to $50,000 in special-education costs for elementary and secondary schools as the child is more likely to be mainstreamed in school and thus use fewer support services than similarly deaf children.

==Efficacy==
A 2019 study found that bilateral cochlear implantation was widely regarded as the most beneficial hearing intervention for acceptable candidates, although it is more likely to be performed and reimbursed in children than adults. The study also found that the efficacy of bilateral implantation could be improved by enhancing communication between the two implants and by developing sound coding strategies specifically for bilateral users.

Early research reviews found that the ability to communicate in spoken language was better the earlier the implantation was performed. The reviews also found that, overall, while cochlear implants provide open-set speech understanding for the majority of implanted profoundly hearing-impaired children, it was not possible to accurately predict the specific outcome of the given implanted child. Research since then has reported long-term socio-economic benefits for children as well as audiological outcomes including improved sound localization and speech perception. A consensus statement from the European Bilateral Pediatric Cochlear Implant Forum also confirmed the importance of bilateral cochlear implantation in children. In adults, new research shows that bilateral implantation can improve quality of life and speech intelligibility in quiet and noise.

A 2015 review examined whether CI implantation to treat people with bilateral hearing loss had any effect on tinnitus. This review found the quality of evidence to be poor and the results variable: overall total tinnitus suppression rates for patients who had tinnitus prior to surgery varied from 8% to 45% of people who received CI; decrease of tinnitus was seen in 25% to 72%, of people; for 0% to 36% of the people there was no change; increase of tinnitus occurred in between 0% to 25% of patients; and, in between 0 and 10% of cases, people who did not have tinnitus before the procedure, got it. Further research found that the electrical stimulation of the CI is at least partly responsible for the general reduction in symptoms. A 2019 study found that although tinnitus suppression in patients with CIs is multifactorial, simply having the CI switched on without any audiological input (while standing alone in a soundproof booth) reduced the symptoms of tinnitus. This would suggest that it is the electrical stimulation that explains the decrease in tinnitus symptoms for many patients, and not only the increased access to sound.

A 2015 literature review on the use of CI for people with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder found that, as of that date, description and diagnosis of the condition was too heterogeneous to make clear claims about whether CI is a safe and effective way to manage it.

The data for cochlear implant outcomes in older adults differs. A 2016 research study found that age at implantation was highly correlated with post-operative speech understanding performance for various test measures. In this study, people who were implanted at age 65 or older performed significantly worse on speech perception testing in quiet and in noisy conditions compared to younger CI users. Other studies have shown different outcomes, with some reporting that adults implanted at the age of 65 and older showed audiological and speech discrimination outcomes similar to younger adults. While cochlear implants demonstrate substantial benefit across all age groups, results will depend on cognitive factors that are ultimately highly age dependent. However, studies have documented the benefit of cochlear implants in octogenarians.

The effects of aging on central auditory processing abilities are thought to play an important role in impacting an individual&#x27;s speech perception with a cochlear implant. The Lancet reported that untreated hearing loss in adults is the number one modifiable risk factor for dementia. In 2017, a study also reported that adults using a cochlear implant had significantly improved cognitive outcomes including working memory, reaction time, and cognitive flexibility compared to people who were waiting to receive a cochlear implant.

Prolonged duration of deafness is another factor that is thought to have a negative impact on overall speech understanding outcomes for CI users. However, a study found no statistical difference in the speech understanding abilities of CI patients over 65 who had been hearing impaired for 30 years or more prior to implantation. In general, outcomes for CI patients are dependent upon the individual&#x27;s level of motivation, expectations, exposure to speech stimuli and consistent participation in aural rehabilitation programs.

A 2016 systematic review of CI for people with unilateral hearing loss (UHL) found that of the studies conducted and published, none were randomized, only one evaluated a control group, and no study was blinded. After eliminating multiple uses of the same subjects, the authors found that 137 people with UHL had received a CI. While acknowledging the weakness of the data, the authors found that CI in people with UHL improves sound localization compared with other treatments in people who lost hearing after they learned to speak; in the one study that examined this, CI did improve sound localization in people with UHL who lost hearing before learning to speak. It appeared to improve speech perception and to reduce tinnitus.

In terms of quality of life, several studies have shown that cochlear implants are beneficial in many aspects of quality of life, including communication improvements and positive effects on social, emotional, psychological and physical well-being. A 2017 narrative review also concluded that the quality of life scores of children using cochlear implants were comparable to those of children without hearing loss. Studies involving adults of all ages reported significant improvement in QoL after implantation when compared to adults with hearing aids. This was often independent of audiological performance.

==Society and culture==

===Usage===
 approximately 188,000 individuals had been fitted with cochlear implants. the same publication cited approximately 324,000 cochlear implant devices having been surgically implanted. In the U.S., roughly 58,000 devices were implanted in adults and 38,000 in children. the Ear Foundation in the United Kingdom, estimates the number of cochlear implant recipients in the world to be about 600,000. The American Cochlear Implant Alliance estimates that 217,000 people received CIs in the United States through the end of 2019.

===Cost and insurance===
Cochlear implantation includes the medical device as well as related services and procedures including pre-operative testing, the surgery, and aftercare that includes audiology and speech language pathology services. These are provided over time by a team of clinicians with specialized training. All of these services, as well as the cochlear implant device and related peripherals, are part of the medical intervention and are typically covered by health insurance in the United States and many areas of the world. These medical services and procedures include candidacy evaluation, hospital services inclusive of supplies and medications used during surgery, surgeon and other physicians such as anesthesiologists, the cochlear implant device and system kit, and programming and (re)habilitation following the surgery. In many countries around the world, the cost of cochlear implantation and aftercare is covered by health insurance. However, financial factors impact the evaluation selection process. Children with public health insurance or no health insurance are less likely to receive the implant before 2 years old.

In the US, as cochlear implants have become more commonplace and accepted as a valuable and cost effective health intervention, insurance coverage has expanded to include private insurance, Medicare, Tricare, the VA System, other federal health plans, and Medicaid. In September 2022 the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services expanded coverage of cochlear implants for appropriate candidates under Medicare. Candidates must demonstrate limited benefit with appropriately fit hearing aids but with criteria now defined by test scores of less than or equal to 60% correct in the best-aided listening condition on recorded tests of open-set sentence recognition. Just as there is with any medical procedure, there are typically co-pays which vary depending upon the insurance plan.

In the United Kingdom, the NHS covers cochlear implants in full, as does Medicare in Australia, and the Department of Health in Ireland, Seguridad Social in Spain, Sistema Sanitario Nazionale in Italy, Sécurité Sociale in France and Israel, and the Ministry of Health or ACC (depending on the cause of deafness) in New Zealand. In Germany and Austria, the cost is covered by most health insurance organizations.

=== Public health ===
6.1% of the world population live with hearing loss, and it is predicted that by 2050, more than 900 million people around the globe will have a disabling hearing loss. According to a WHO report, unaddressed hearing loss costs the world 980 billion dollars annually. Particularly hard hit are the healthcare and educational sectors, as well as societal costs. 53% of these costs are attributable to low- and middle-income countries.

The WHO reports that cochlear implants have been shown to be a cost-effective way to mitigate the challenges of hearing loss. In a low-to-middle-income setting, every dollar invested in unilateral cochlear implants has a return on investment of 1.46 dollars. This rises to a return on investment of 4.09 dollars in an upper-middle-income setting. A study in Colombia assessed the lifetime investments made in 68 children who received cochlear implants at an early age. Taking into account the cost of the device and any other medical costs, follow-up, speech therapy, batteries and travel, each child required an average investment of US$99 000 over the course of their life (assuming a life span of 78 years for women and 72 years for men). The study concluded that for every dollar invested in rehabilitation of a child with a cochlear implant, there was a return on investment of US$2.07.

===Manufacturers===
As of 2021, four cochlear implant devices approved for use in the United States are manufactured by Cochlear Limited, the Advanced Bionics division of Sonova, MED-EL, and Oticon Medical.

In Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, and Canada, an additional device manufactured by Neurelec (later acquired by Oticon Medical) was available. A device made by Nurotron (China) was also available in some parts of the world. Each manufacturer has adapted some of the successful innovations of the other companies to its own devices. There is no consensus that any one of these implants is superior to the others. Users of all devices report a wide range of performance after implantation.

===Criticism and controversy===
Much of the strongest objection to cochlear implants has come from within the deaf community, some of whom are pre-lingually deaf people whose first language is a sign language. Some in the deaf community call cochlear implants audist and an affront to their culture, which, as they view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority. This is an old problem for the deaf community, going back as far as the 18th century with the argument of manualism vs. oralism. This is consistent with medicalisation and the standardisation of the &quot;normal&quot; body in the 19th century when differences between normal and abnormal began to be debated. It is important to consider the sociocultural context, particularly in regards to the deaf community, which has its own unique language and culture. This accounts for the cochlear implant being seen as an affront to their culture, as many do not believe that deafness is something that needs to be cured. However, it has also been argued that this does not necessarily have to be the case: the cochlear implant can act as a tool deaf people can use to access the &quot;hearing world&quot; without losing their deaf identity.

Cochlear implants for congenitally deaf children are most effective when implanted at a young age. Children who have had confirmed severe hearing loss can receive the implant as young as 9 months old. Evidence shows that deaf children of deaf parents (or with fluent signers as daily caregivers) learn signed language as effectively as hearing peers. Some deaf-community advocates recommend that all deaf children should learn sign language from birth, but more than 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents. Since it takes years to become fluent in sign language, deaf children who grow up without amplification such as hearing aids or cochlear implants will not have daily access to fluent language models in households without fluent signers.

Critics of cochlear implants from deaf cultures also assert that the cochlear implant and the subsequent therapy often become the focus of the child&#x27;s identity at the expense of language acquisition and ease of communication in sign language and deaf identity. They believe that measuring a child&#x27;s success only by their mastery of speech will lead to a poor self-image as &quot;disabled&quot; (because the implants do not produce normal hearing) rather than having the healthy self-concept of a proudly deaf person. However, these assertions are not supported by research. The first children to receive cochlear implants as infants are only in their 20s (as of 2020), and anecdotal evidence points to a high level of satisfaction in this cohort, most of whom don&#x27;t consider their deafness their primary identity.

Children with cochlear implants are most likely to be educated with listening and spoken language, without sign language and are often not educated with other deaf children who use sign language. Cochlear implants have been one of the technological and social factors implicated in the decline of sign languages in the developed world. Some Deaf activists have labeled the widespread implantation of children as a cultural genocide.

As the trend for cochlear implants in children grows, deaf-community advocates have tried to counter the &quot;either or&quot; formulation of oralism vs. manualism with a &quot;both and&quot; or &quot;bilingual-bicultural&quot; approach; some schools are now successfully integrating cochlear implants with sign language in their educational programs. However, there is disagreement among researchers about the effectiveness of methods using both sign and speech as compared to sign or speech alone.

Another point of controversy made by advocates are that there are racial disparities in the cochlear implantation evaluation process. Data taken from 2010-2020 at one academic tertiary care institution showed that 68.5% of patients referred for evaluation were White, 18.5% were Black, and 12.3% were Asian, however the institution&#x27;s main service area was 46.9% White, 42.3% Black, and 7.7% Asian. It was also shown that the Black patients who were referred for evaluation to receive the implants had greater hearing loss compared to White patients who were also referred. Based on this study, it is shown that Black patients receive cochlear implants at a disproportionately lower rate than White patients.

<text>Yamhad (Yamḫad) was an ancient Semitic-speaking kingdom centered on Ḥalab (Aleppo) in Syria. The kingdom emerged at the end of the 19th century BC and was ruled by the Yamhad dynasty, who counted on both military and diplomacy to expand their realm. From the beginning of its establishment, the kingdom withstood the aggressions of its neighbors Mari, Qatna and the Old Assyrian Empire, and was turned into the most powerful Syrian kingdom of its era through the actions of its king Yarim-Lim I. By the middle of the 18th century BC, most of Syria minus the south came under the authority of Yamhad, either as a direct possession or through vassalage, and for nearly a century and a half, Yamhad dominated northern, northwestern and eastern Syria, and had influence over small kingdoms in Mesopotamia at the borders of Elam. The kingdom was eventually destroyed by the Hittites, then annexed by Mitanni in the 16th century BC.
Yamhad&#x27;s population was predominately Amorite, and had a typical Bronze Age Syrian culture. Yamhad was also inhabited by a substantial Hurrian population that settled in the kingdom, adding the influence of their culture. Yamhad controlled a wide trading network, being a gateway between the eastern Iranian plateau and the Aegean region in the west. Yamhad worshiped the traditional Northwest Semitic deities, and the capital Halab was considered a holy city among the other Syrian cities as a center of worship for Hadad, who was regarded as the main deity of northern Syria.

==History==
Little of Halab has been excavated by archaeologists, as Halab was never abandoned during its long history and the modern city is situated above the ancient site. Therefore, most of the knowledge about Yamhad comes from tablets discovered at Alalakh and Mari.

===Establishment===
The name Yamhad was likely an Amorite tribal name and is used synonymously with Halab when referring to the kingdom. The city of Halab was a religious center in northern Syria, and was mentioned by the name Ha-lam, as a vassal of the Eblaite empire, which controlled most of Syria in the middle of the third millennium BC. Halab&#x27;s fame as a Holy City contributed to its later prominence; the main temple of the north Syrian storm god Hadad was located in the city, which was known as the &quot;City of Hadad&quot;.

The name Halab as well as that of Yamhad appeared for the first time during the Old Babylonian period, when Sumu-Epuh, the first Yamhadite king, was attested in a seal from Mari as the ruler of the land of Yamhad, which included, in addition to Halab, the cities of Alalakh and Tuba. Sumu-Epuh consolidated the kingdom and faced Yahdun-Lim of Mari who had a dynastic alliance with Yamhad to oppose Assyria, but eventually campaigned in the north threatening the kingdom. The Yamhadite king supported the Yaminite tribes and formed an alliance with other Syrian states including Urshu, Hassum and Carchemish, against the Mariote king who defeated his enemies, who was eventually killed by his own son Sumu-Yamam.

===Rivalry with Assyria and expansion===

The rise of Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria proved more dangerous to Yamhad than Mari. The Amorite king of Assyria was an ambitious conqueror with the aim to rule Mesopotamia and the Levant, and styled himself as &quot;king of the world&quot;. Shamshi-Adad surrounded Yamhad by way of alliances with Charchemish, Hassum and Urshu to the north and by conquering Mari to the east, forcing Zimri-Lim the heir of Mari to flee. Sumu-Epuh welcomed Zimri-Lim and aimed to use him against Assyria since he was the legitimate heir of Mari.

Shamshi-Adad&#x27;s most dangerous alliance was with Qatna, whose king Ishi-Addu became Assyria&#x27;s agent at Yamhad&#x27;s borders and married his daughter to Yasmah-Adad, the son of the Assyrian king who was installed by his father as king of Mari. Sumu-Epuh was apparently killed during his fight with Shamshi-Adad and was succeeded by his son Yarim-Lim I, who consolidated his father&#x27;s kingdom and turned it into the most powerful kingdom in Syria and northern Mesopotamia. Yarim-Lim surrounded Shamshi-Adad by alliances with Hammurabi of Babylon and Ibal-pi-el II of Eshnunna, then in 1777 BC he advanced to the east conquering Tuttul and installing Zimri-Lim as governor of the city. The death of the Assyrian king came a year later. Yarim-Lim then sent his army with Zimri-Lim, to restore his ancestor&#x27;s throne as an ally-vassal to Yamhad, cementing the relationship through a dynastic marriage between the new Mariote king and Shibtu, the daughter of Yarim-Lim.

Yarim-Lim spent the next years of his reign expanding the kingdom, which reached Mamma in the north. The Syrian city-states were subdued through alliances or force; Mamma, Ebla and Ugarit became vassals of Yamhad, while Qatna remained independent but came to peace with Yamhad following the death of its ally, the late Shamshi-Adad I. A sample of Yarim-Lim policy of diplomacy and war can be read in a tablet discovered at Mari, that was sent to the king of Dēr in southern Mesopotamia, which included a declaration of war against Der and its neighbor Diniktum, the tablet mentions the stationing of 500 Yamhadite warships for twelve years in Diniktum, and the Yamhadite military support of Der for 15 years. Yarim-Lim&#x27;s accomplishments elevated Yamhad into the status of a Great Kingdom and the Yamhadite king title became the Great King.

Yarim-Lim I was succeeded by his son Hammurabi I who had a peaceful reign. He was able to force Charchemish into submission, and sent troops to aid Hammurabi of Babylon against Larsa and Elam. The alliance ended after the Babylonian king sacked Mari and destroyed it. Babylon did not attack Yamhad, however, and the relations between the two kingdoms remained peaceful in later years; the power vacuum caused by Mari&#x27;s fall opened the way for Hammurabi to extend Yamhad&#x27;s hegemony over the upper Khabur valley in the east, where the ruler of Shubat Enlil became his vassal. Hammurabi I was succeeded by his son Abba-El I, whose reign witnessed the rebellion of the city Irridu, which was under the authority of prince Yarim-Lim, Abba-El&#x27;s brother. The king responded to the rebellion by destroying Irridu, and compensating his brother by giving him the throne of Alalakh, thus creating a cadet branch of the dynasty.

===Decline and end===

The era of Abba-El I&#x27;s successors is poorly documented, and by the time of Yarim-Lim III in the mid-17th century BC, the power of Yamhad declined due to internal dissent. Yarim-Lim III ruled a weakened kingdom, and although he imposed Yamhadite hegemony over Qatna, the weakening was obvious as Alalakh had become all but independent under the self-declared king Ammitakum. In spite of this regression, the king of Yamhad remained the strongest king of the Syrian states, as he was referred to as a Great King by the Hittites, the diplomatic equal of the Hittite king.

The rise of the Hittite kingdom in the north posed the biggest threat to Yamhad, although Yarim-Lim III and his successor Hammurabi III were able to withstand the aggressions of the Hittite king Hattusili I through alliances with the Hurrian principalities. Hattusili chose not to attack Halab directly and began with conquering Yamhad&#x27;s vassals and allies, starting with Alalakh in the second year of his Syrian campaigns c. 1650 BC (Middle chronology) or slightly later. Hattusili then turned to attack the Hurrians in Urshu northeast of Halab, and won in spite of military support from Halab and Carchemish for the Hurrians. The Hittite king then defeated Yamhad in the battle of Mount Atalur, and sacked Hassum along with several other Hurrian cities in the sixth year of his Syrian wars. After many campaigns, Hattusili I finally attacked Halab during the reign of Hammurabi III. The attack ended in a defeat, the wounding of the Hittite king and his later death c. 1620 BC. Hattusili&#x27;s campaigns considerably weakened Yamhad, causing it to decline in status: the monarch ceased to be styled a Great King.

Hattusili was succeeded by his grandson Mursili I, who conquered Halab c. 1600 BC and destroyed Yamhad as a major power in the Levant. Mursili then left for Babylon and sacked it, but was assassinated upon his return to his capital Hattusa, and his empire disintegrated. Halab was rebuilt and the kingdom expanded to include Alalakh again. The reestablished kingdom was ruled by kings of whom nothing but their names is known; the first is Sarra-El, who might have been the son of Yarim-Lim III. The last king of the dynasty to rule as king of Halab was Ilim-Ilimma I, whose reign ended c. 1524 when he was killed during a rebellion orchestrated by king Parshatatar of Mitanni who annexed Halab. Ilim-Ilimma&#x27;s son, Idrimi, fled to Emar then conquered Alalakh c. 1517 BC. Seven years following his conquest of Alalakh, Idrimi made peace with Mitanni and was acknowledged as a vassal, and allowed to control Halab, though he had to relocate the dynasty&#x27;s residence to Alalakh and relinquish the title of &quot;King of Halab&quot;; the use of the name Yamhad also ended.

===Kings of Yamhad===
Dates are estimated and given by the Middle chronology.


==People and culture==

The people of Yamhad were Amorites and spoke the Amorite language, and apart from a few Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Aegean influences, Yamhad belonged mainly to middle Bronze Age Syrian culture. This culture influenced the architecture and the functions of the temples, which were mainly cultic, while political authority was invested in the royal palace, in contrast to the important political role of the temples in Mesopotamia.

Since the capital Halab has not been excavated, the architecture of the kingdom is archaeologically best represented by the city of Alalakh, which was subordinate to Halab and ruled by a king belonging to the Yamhadite royal house. The Amorites in general built large palaces that bear architectural similarities to old Babylonian-era palaces. They were adorned with grand central courtyards, throne rooms, tiled floors, drainage systems and plastered walls, which suggest the employment of specialized labor. Evidence exists for the presence of Minoan Aegean fresco artists who painted elaborate scenes on the walls of the palaces in Alalakh.

Yamhad had a distinctive Syrian iconography, which is clear in the seals of the kings that gave prominence to the Syrian gods. Egyptian influence was minimal and limited to the ankh, which cannot be interpreted as an emulation of Egyptian rituals but rather as merely a substitute for the cup held by the deity elsewhere. Yamhad had a special pattern of trim called the Yamhad style, which was favored in Mari during the reign of king Zimri-Lim, whose queen Shibtu was the daughter of Yarim-Lim I.

After the fall of the Akkadian Empire, Hurrians began to settle in the city and its surroundings, and by c. 1725 BC they constituted a sizable portion of the population. The presence of a large Hurrian population brought Hurrian culture and religion to Halab, as evidenced by the existence of certain religious festivals that bear Hurrian names.

==Economy==
Halab&#x27;s location has always been a factor in its prominence as an economic center. Yamhad&#x27;s economy was based on trade with the Iranian Plateau, Mesopotamia, Cyprus and Anatolia, with the city of Emar as its port on the Euphrates, and Alalakh with its proximity to the sea as its port on the Mediterranean.

The actions of Yarim-Lim I and his alliance with Babylon proved vital for the kingdom&#x27;s economy, for they secured the trade between Mesopotamia and northern Syria, with the king of Mari protecting the caravans crossing from the Persian Gulf to Anatolia. Emar attracted many Babylonian merchants, who lived in the city and had a lasting impact on the local scribal conventions. As late as the 14th century BC, texts of the so-called Syrian type from Emar preserve distinct Babylonian traits.

The markets of Yamhad became a source of copper, which was imported from the mountains (probably Anatolian) and Cyprus. However, the Babylonian invasion of Mari had a negative impact on the trade between the two kingdoms, as the road became dangerous because of the loss of Mari&#x27;s protection to the caravans. This led the Babylonian king Samsu-iluna to build many strongholds up the river valley, and to establish colonies of mercenaries known as the &quot;Kassite Houses&quot; to protect the middle Euphrates area. Those colonies later evolved into semi-independent polities that waged a war against the Babylonian king Ammi-Saduqa and caused the trade temporarily to stop.

==Religion==

The people of Yamhad practiced the Amorite religion, and mainly worshiped the Northwest Semitic deities. The most important of these were Dagon, who was considered the father of the gods, and Hadad, who was the most important deity and the head of the pantheon. The kingdom was known as the &quot;land of Hadad&quot;, who was famous as the Storm-God of Halab beginning in the middle of the 3rd millennium BC. His main temple was located on the citadel hill in the center of the city and remained in use from the 24th century BC, until at least the 9th century BC.

The title &quot;Beloved of Hadad&quot; was one of the king&#x27;s titles. Hadad was the kingdom&#x27;s patron god, and all treaties were concluded in his name, which was also used to threaten other kingdoms, and to declare wars. As the Hurrian presence grew, so did Hurrian religious influences and some of the Hurrian deities found a place in the Yamhadite pantheon. King Abba-El I mentioned receiving the support of the Hurrian goddess Hebat in one of the Alalakh tablets (Hebat was the spouse of the Hurrian main deity Teshub, but in Abba-El I&#x27;s tablet, she is associated with Hadad). Later, the Hurrians started to identify Teshub with Hadad, who became Teshub the Storm-God of Halab.

Beside the general gods, the kings had a &quot;head god&quot;, that is, a deity who had an intimate connection for the worshiper. King Yarim-Lim I described Hadad as the god of the state, but the Mesopotamian deity Sin as the god of his head. His son Hammurabi I did likewise.

<text>Curtis Montague Schilling (born November 14, 1966) is an American former Major League Baseball right handed pitcher and commentator for media outlet BlazeTV. He helped lead the Philadelphia Phillies to a World Series appearance in 1993, and won championships in 2001 with the Arizona Diamondbacks and in 2004 and 2007 with the Boston Red Sox, being named a co-winner of the World Series MVP in 2001. Schilling retired with a career postseason record of 11–2, and his .846 postseason winning percentage is a major-league record among pitchers with at least ten decisions. He is a member of the 3,000 strikeout club and has the highest strikeout-to-walk ratio of any of its inactive members. He is tied at third place for the most 300-strikeout seasons.

After retiring, he founded Green Monster Games, which was renamed 38 Studios. The company released &quot;Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning&quot; in February 2012. Three months later, they laid off their entire staff amid severe financial troubles. As a radio personality, Schilling was signed by the Howie Carr radio network to do a Saturday morning politics and sports show. As a conservative, Schilling joined Breitbart in 2016.

==Early life==
Schilling was born in Alaska. He went to high school in Phoenix, Arizona, attending Shadow Mountain High School.

==Playing career==
===Amateur baseball===
Schilling played for Shadow Mountain High School in Phoenix, Arizona, before attending Yavapai College in Prescott, Arizona, in 1985.

===Orioles and Astros (1988–1992)===
Schilling began his professional career in the Boston Red Sox farm system as a second-round pick in what would be MLB&#x27;s final January draft. He began his professional career with the Elmira Pioneers, then a Red Sox minor-league affiliate.

After beginning 1988 with an 8–4 record and a 2.97 earned run average in 21 games with the New Britain Red Sox, he was traded along with Brady Anderson to the Baltimore Orioles for Mike Boddicker on July 29, two days prior to the trade deadline. Schilling allowed three runs in seven innings as the starter in a 4–3 win over the Red Sox in his MLB debut at Memorial Stadium on September 7, 1988. Orioles manager Frank Robinson said of Schilling&#x27;s performance, &quot;He showed he doesn&#x27;t get rattled out there.&quot; He was the losing pitcher in each of his remaining three starts of 1988, including a season-ending 9–3 defeat to the Toronto Blue Jays at Exhibition Stadium on October 2.

Schilling earned both his first save and win in 1990. The save was the result of not allowing a run in the last innings of a 6–2 victory over the Minnesota Twins at the Metrodome which was his first Orioles appearance of the year on June 29. The win came two weeks later when he pitched two shutout innings in relief in a 7–5 home triumph over the Kansas City Royals on July 11. Working exclusively out of the bullpen, he finished the season with a 1–2 record and a 2.54 ERA.

In a transaction considered by Orioles fans as the worst in team history according to Thom Loverro, Schilling was dealt along with Steve Finley and Pete Harnisch to the Houston Astros for Glenn Davis on January 10, 1991. He joined an Astros organization that was for sale and lightening its payroll by going with younger, inexpensive players.

Schilling was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for pitcher Jason Grimsley on April 2, 1992.

===Philadelphia Phillies (1992–2000)===
After having struggled with the Orioles and Astros, Schilling was given the chance to pitch and start with the Philadelphia Phillies on a regular basis and flourished as the ace of the Phillies staff, leading the team in wins (14), ERA (2.35), strikeouts (147) and shutouts (4) in his first season with them in 1992. During the Phillies&#x27; pennant run in 1993, Schilling went 16–7 with a 4.02 ERA and 186 strikeouts. Schilling led the Phillies to an upset against the two-time defending National League champion Atlanta Braves in the National League Championship Series. Although he received no decisions during his two appearances in the six-game series, Schilling&#x27;s 1.69 ERA and 19 strikeouts (including the first 5 Braves hitters of Game 1, an NLCS record) were enough to earn him the 1993 NLCS Most Valuable Player Award. The Phillies went on to face the defending world champion Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series. After losing Game 1, he pitched brilliantly in his next start. With the Phillies facing elimination the day after losing a bizarre 15–14 contest at home in Veterans Stadium, Schilling pitched a five-hit shutout that the Phillies won, 2–0.

Schilling was named to the NL All-Star team in 1997, 1998, and 1999 and started the 1999 game. In 1997, he finished 14th in NL MVP voting and fourth in NL Cy Young voting. During this season he set the Phillies single-season strikeout record with 319, surpassing the previous record of 310 strikeouts set by Steve Carlton who had held the record since 1972. Schilling either led or tied for the Phillies leader in wins, complete games, shutouts, and ERA among starters each season from 1997 to 1999, averaging 16 wins per season over those three years despite the team never finishing the season with a winning record. Unhappy with the team&#x27;s performance, he requested a trade to a more competitive team in 2000 and was subsequently dealt to the Arizona Diamondbacks. His 101 career victories ranks sixth all-time for Phillies pitchers, 20th in ERA (3.35), 23rd in games appeared in (242), sixth in games started (226), 34th in complete games (61), 13th in shutouts (14), fourth in strikeouts (1554), and eighth in innings pitched (). Schilling spent eight and a half years with Philadelphia, his longest tenure with any team.

===Arizona Diamondbacks (2000–2003)===
Schilling was traded to the Diamondbacks on July 26, 2000, for first baseman Travis Lee and pitchers Vicente Padilla, Omar Daal, and Nelson Figueroa. With Arizona, he went 22–6 with a 2.98 ERA in 2001, leading the majors in wins and innings pitched. He also went 4–0 with a 1.12 ERA in the playoffs. In the 2001 World Series, the Diamondbacks beat the New York Yankees in seven games. Schilling was 1–0 in that World Series with a 1.69 ERA and 26 strikeouts in 21 innings, though he also allowed a go-ahead home run in the 8th inning of Game Seven. He shared the 2001 World Series MVP Award with teammate Randy Johnson (who relieved Schilling in Game Seven and got the win after the Diamondbacks&#x27; dramatic ninth-inning comeback). Schilling and Johnson also shared &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2001 &quot;Sportsmen of the Year&quot; award. During the World Series Schilling received two other honors, as he was presented that year&#x27;s Roberto Clemente and Branch Rickey Awards, the first Arizona Diamondback so honored for either award.

In 2002, he went 23–7 with a 3.23 ERA. He struck out 316 batters while walking 33 in innings. On April 7, 2002, Schilling threw a one-hit shutout striking out 17 against the Milwaukee Brewers. Both years he finished second in the Cy Young Award voting to Johnson. Schilling finished the 2003 season with an 8–9 record and a 2.95 ERA in 168 innings while striking out 194 batters. In November 2003, the Diamondbacks traded Schilling to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Jorge de la Rosa, Casey Fossum, Mike Goss, and Brandon Lyon.

===Boston Red Sox (2004–2007)===

The trade to Boston reunited Schilling with Terry Francona, his manager during his final four years with the Philadelphia Phillies. On September 16, 2004, Schilling won his 20th game of 2004 for the Red Sox, becoming the fifth Boston pitcher to win 20 or more games in his first season with the team, and the first since Hall of Famer Dennis Eckersley in 1978. Schilling ended his regular season with a 21–6 record.

On October 19, 2004, Schilling won Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees. Notably, he won this game playing on an injured ankle—the same injuries that contributed to his disastrous outing in Game 1 of the ALCS. These injuries were so acute that by the end of his Game 6 performance, blood visibly soaked part of his white sock, which is now referred to as &quot;the bloody sock&quot;. The victory forced a Game 7, which the Red Sox would go on to win to capture the pennant and make their first World Series appearance since 1986. Schilling pitched (and won) Game 2 of the 2004 World Series for the Red Sox against the St. Louis Cardinals. In both series, he had to have the tendon in his right ankle stabilized repeatedly, in what has become known as the Schilling tendon procedure, after the tendon sheath was torn during his Game 1 ALDS appearance against the Anaheim Angels. As in Game 6 of the ALCS, Schilling&#x27;s sock was soaked with blood from the sutures used in this medical procedure, but he still managed to pitch seven strong innings, giving up one run on four hits and striking out four. This second bloody sock was placed in the Baseball Hall of Fame after Boston&#x27;s victory over St. Louis in the World Series. A four-game sweep of the World Series erased the Curse of the Bambino. On February 23, 2013, the first bloody sock was sold at a live auction at the Fletcher-Sinclair Mansion for $92,613 to an anonymous bidder.

Schilling was once again runner-up in Cy Young voting in 2004, this time to Minnesota Twins hurler Johan Santana, who was a unanimous selection, receiving all 28 first-place votes. Schilling received 27 of the 28 second-place votes. Later, the entire Red Sox team was named &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; 2004 Sportsmen of the Year, making Schilling only the second person to have won or shared that award twice.

Schilling began 2005 on the disabled list due to recurrent ankle injuries. He returned on April 13 and made three starts before landing on the DL again. He returned in July as Boston&#x27;s closer. He eventually returned to the starting rotation and continued to struggle. The Red Sox made it to the playoffs, but were swept by the Chicago White Sox in three games.

For the 2006 season, Schilling was said to be healthy. He began the season 4–0 with a 1.61 ERA. He finished the year with a 15–7 record and 198 strikeouts, with a respectable 3.97 ERA. On May 27, he earned his 200th career win, the 104th major league pitcher to accomplish the feat. On August 30, Schilling collected his 3,000th strikeout. Schilling has the highest ratio of strikeouts to walks of any pitcher with at least 3,000 strikeouts, and is one of four pitchers to reach the 3,000-K milestone before reaching 1,000 career walks. The other three who accomplished this feat are Fergie Jenkins, Greg Maddux, and former Boston Red Sox ace and teammate Pedro Martínez.

In January 2007, Schilling announced on the Dennis and Callahan show that after talking with his family he had changed his mind, and did not want to retire at the conclusion of the 2007 season. He sought to negotiate an extension to his current contract, but Red Sox executives announced that they would not negotiate with him until after the season, citing Schilling&#x27;s age and physical condition as factors in their decision. Schilling went on to say he would become a free agent at the end of the season, for the first time in his career, and would not negotiate with the Red Sox during the 15 days after the end of the World Series when the team has exclusive negotiating rights with potential free agents. On a June appearance on the Dennis and Callahan Show, Schilling stated he would accept a one-year extension to his contract at his current salary if the Red Sox offered it to him. Questioned on his statement, Schilling said, &quot;I said I wouldn&#x27;t negotiate a deal during the season, and I&#x27;m saying that now. But I would accept that offer.&quot;

On June 7, 2007, Schilling came within one out of his first career no-hitter. Schilling gave up a two-out single to Oakland&#x27;s Shannon Stewart, who lined a 95-mph fastball to right field for the A&#x27;s only hit. Schilling followed up his one-hitter with two poor starts and was sent back to Boston on June 20 for an MRI on his shoulder and was placed on the disabled list. He returned from the disabled list on August 6, pitching at least six innings in each of his nine starts following the All-Star break.

Schilling continued his career postseason success in 2007, throwing seven shutout innings in a 9–1 victory over the Angels in the ALDS, wrapping up a three-game sweep for Boston. However, he did not fare as well pitching in Game 2 of the ALCS against Cleveland, surrendering nine hits—two of them home runs—and five earned runs in just innings. He did start again in the sixth game of the series, pitching seven complete innings during which he recorded five strikeouts, surrendering no walks with only two earned runs to gain the victory and force a Game 7. He earned his third win of the 2007 playoffs in Game 2 of the 2007 World Series leaving after innings, striking out four while allowing only four hits. With this win, he became only the second pitcher over the age of 40 to start and win a World Series game (Kenny Rogers became the first just one year prior). As Schilling departed in the 6th inning, fans at Fenway Park gave Schilling a standing ovation.

Schilling filed for free agency on October 30, 2007. He said he would seek a one-year deal, and according to ESPN First Take and his own blog page 38 Pitches. Schilling later signed a one-year deal with the Boston Red Sox for the 2008 season. Schilling missed all of the 2008 season because of a shoulder injury. The injury was first revealed in February 2008 and the treatment options became a point of contention between Schilling and the Red Sox management. On March 13, 2008, the Red Sox placed Schilling on the 60-day disabled list as he continued to rehabilitate his right shoulder. On June 18, 2008, Curt Schilling left the team to be reevaluated after suffering pain when throwing off the mound. On June 20, 2008, Schilling stated on WEEI&#x27;s Dennis and Callahan show that he would undergo season-ending surgery and that he had possibly thrown the last pitch of his career. On June 23, 2008, Schilling underwent biceps surgery, during which a small undersurface tear on the rotator cuff was discovered and stitched, and a separation of the labrum was repaired. According to his surgeon, he could begin throwing in four months.

===Retirement and honors===
On March 23, 2009, Schilling officially announced his retirement from professional baseball after 20 seasons. Schilling ended his career with a 216–146 record, 3.46 ERA and 3116 strikeouts, 15th-most in MLB history. He was selected to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2012. On August 2, 2013, Schilling was inducted into the Philadelphia Phillies Wall of Fame.

====National Baseball Hall of Fame consideration====
Having last pitched in 2007, Schilling became eligible for election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame with the 2013 ballot, when he received 38.8% of the vote, well short of the 75% required for induction, but well above the 5% required to remain on the ballot. His support ramped in subsequent elections; in 2020 balloting he appeared on 278 of the 397 ballots cast (70.0%), just 20 votes short. In 2021 balloting, announced on January 26, 2021, Schilling appeared on 71.1% of the ballots cast, again falling short of the 75% election threshold. The degree to which Schilling&#x27;s &quot;propensity for divisive statements&quot; may have influenced voters has been discussed by media. Following the announcement of 2021 balloting results, Schilling announced on Facebook that he would be asking the Hall of Fame to remove his name from the 2022 ballot and that he would defer to the Veterans Committee to judge his career. The BBWAA enjoined the Hall of Fame to ignore his request and leave him on the ballot for 2022. He was not selected on the 2022 ballot, receiving 58.6% of the vote in his 10th and final year on the BBWAA ballot. He was eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame through the Contemporary Baseball Era Players Committee in December 2022 but did not receive enough votes for induction.

== Pitching style ==
During the prime of his career, Schilling was capable of reaching and sustaining speeds of 94–98 mph on his four-seam fastball. Throughout his career, he was characterized by a determination to go deep into games, routinely pitching past the sixth and seventh innings. He combined his endurance with pinpoint control, especially on his fastball. Schilling&#x27;s &quot;out&quot; pitch was a split-finger fastball, which he generally located beneath the strike zone (resulting in many swinging strikeouts). He also possessed an above-average changeup, an effective slider, and mixed in an occasional curveball, though he mainly alternated between his fastball and splitter. Though his velocity decreased in later years (to the 89–93 range on his fastball), his control remained excellent, and he is currently fifth in career strikeout to walk ratio.

==Post-baseball career==
===Broadcast analyst===
Schilling debuted on ESPN as a baseball color analyst on April 4, 2010, on the pre-game show for the 2010 season opener between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. He has written for WEEI.com, 38pitches.com, and WordPress.com. In 2014, he was named as an analyst for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot;, although his subsequent cancer diagnosis prevented him from working the telecasts for most of the season. On September 14, 2014, Schilling returned to the &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; booth as the Yankees played the Baltimore Orioles.

On August 25, 2015, ESPN.com suspended Schilling&#x27;s coverage of the ongoing Little League World Series and &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; after he posted a Twitter meme that compared Muslim Jihadism and German Nazis, &quot;the math is staggering when you get to the true [number]s&quot;. Schilling deleted and apologized for the controversial tweet the same day. Schilling was also suspended from the next Sunday night game. On September 3, 2015, ESPN announced his suspension would cover all remaining 2015 &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; games as well as its 2015 MLB playoff coverage.

On April 20, 2016, ESPN announced that they had fired Schilling after he shared an &quot;anti-transgender&quot; Facebook post, saying, &quot;ESPN is an inclusive company. Curt Schilling has been advised that his conduct was unacceptable and his employment with ESPN has been terminated.&quot; Schilling&#x27;s social media post came shortly after passage of the North Carolina transgender restroom law. In September 2017, Schilling accused ESPN of a double standard when reporter Jemele Hill was not fired or suspended following a controversial social media post about Donald Trump. In an on-air phone interview with CNN, Schilling defended Hill&#x27;s right to speak her mind, then stated, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t fired for speaking my mind; I was fired for being a conservative.&quot;

===Political involvement===
Schilling campaigned for President George W. Bush in 2004, while several members of the ownership of the Red Sox campaigned for the Democratic challenger, Senator John Kerry. Schilling said he was encouraged to run for Kerry&#x27;s seat in the U.S. Senate in 2008 as a Republican. Schilling was quoted in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; as saying that he intended to pitch in 2008, which would preclude a Senate run.

He was called to Capitol Hill to testify about anabolic steroid use in March 2005, not as a suspected user but rather as a vocal opponent. He has said that Jose Canseco&#x27;s statistics should be thrown out due to his admitted use of steroids, and has also said that unless he can refute allegations that he used performance-enhancing drugs, Roger Clemens should be stripped of the four Cy Young Awards he has won since 1997.

On January 29, 2007, Schilling announced in an interview that he would support Senator John McCain, who became the Republican nominee in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. In the same interview, he criticized then-presidential Democratic candidate and Senator Hillary Clinton for comments criticizing the war in Iraq. Schilling also turned up on the campaign trail several times stumping for McCain.

Schilling was mentioned as a possible candidate for U.S. Senate in the special election in Massachusetts for the seat left vacant by the death of Senator Ted Kennedy. He ruled out a run during his September 24, 2009, appearance on sports radio talk show &quot;Dennis and Callahan&quot;. In 2009, Schilling endorsed Scott Brown for the seat. During the campaign, Martha Coakley, the Democratic candidate, called Schilling a Yankee fan. Coakley was ridiculed for the comment; critics said it showed she was out of touch with the Boston community. Schilling joked about the incident: &quot;I&#x27;ve been called a lot of things... But never, and I mean never, could anyone ever make the mistake of calling me a Yankee fan. Well, check that, if you didn&#x27;t know what the hell is going on in your own state, maybe you could.&quot;

In October 2016, Schilling joined Breitbart News, a far-right opinion and news organization. Schilling announced that he would challenge Senator Elizabeth Warren in the 2018 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, but ended up dropping out and supported politician and conspiracy theorist Shiva Ayyadurai in the race. Schilling expressed interest in running for president in 2024 had Donald Trump been re-elected in 2020.

In November 2014, Schilling got into a day-long Twitter argument with baseball writer Keith Law over the creation–evolution controversy, where he argued for creationism against Law&#x27;s defense of evolution, after which ESPN decided to suspend Law&#x27;s Twitter account. ESPN commented that &quot;Keith&#x27;s Twitter suspension had absolutely nothing to do with his opinions on the subject&quot;, but it remains unclear what other motivation is behind the act, since the conversation between Schilling and Law reportedly &quot;never really turned hostile&quot;, with many reading the details feeling that his suspension was &quot;ridiculous&quot;. Schilling&#x27;s account was not suspended, and he continued to tweet. Returning to Twitter after the ban expired, Law&#x27;s first tweet &quot;Eppur si muove&quot; (&quot;And yet it moves&quot;) made clear that Schilling&#x27;s complaints about his posts contradicting his argument were in fact the reason for the suspension.

Schilling attracted further media scrutiny about tweets in which he showed support for lynching journalists and the January 6 U.S. Capitol attack.

On September 25, 2023, Schilling attracted controversy when he reposted an anti-Semitic tweet that made references to on &quot;Jews in leading roles&quot; in government and society, the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;, and Jews &quot;dominating important sectors of a nation… when they didn&#x27;t even found said nation.&quot;

===38 Studios===
In 2006, Schilling created Green Monster Games, which Schilling stated was &quot;not&quot; named after the Fenway left field wall. In early 2007, the company&#x27;s name changed to 38 Studios.

In January 2008, Schilling announced that he would be focusing on an MMORPG project after his retirement. Comic book creator Todd McFarlane and fantasy author R.A. Salvatore were working with Schilling on the project. The new game was developed under the code-name Copernicus. A single-player RPG set in the same setting, titled &quot;Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning&quot;, was released by 38 Studios in February 2012. Executives from 38 Studios introduced the game at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con.

In July 2010, the Rhode Island Board of Economic Development approved a $75 million guaranteed loan to 38 Studios. 38 Studios promised to bring 450 jobs to the state by the end of 2012. In May 2012, 38 Studios defaulted on its loan from the state of Rhode Island and failed to meet payroll obligations to its employees. 38 Studios and its subsidiary, Big Huge Games, then laid off their staffs with a mass email. Some of the laid-off employees may have had second mortgages, because the company had not actually sold homes for them as part of a relocation package. Some have accused Schilling of hypocrisy based on the conflict between his professed views on &quot;big government&quot; and the studio&#x27;s relationship with &quot;big government&quot;. On November 1, 2012, Schilling was sued by the state in connection with the loan. Governor Lincoln Chafee said: &quot;My message to Rhode Islanders is this: I know that you work hard for your paychecks, and for your tax dollars to be squandered is unacceptable. The Board&#x27;s legal action was taken to rectify a grave injustice put upon the people of Rhode Island.&quot;

In a July 2012 interview, Schilling discussed the downfall of 38 Studios, citing the Rhode Island governor and his own optimism as the primary reasons for the demise of the company. Ultimately, the company filed for bankruptcy; Schilling, other 38 Studios executives, and other parties associated with the company agreed in a court settlement to repay the state of Rhode Island $61 million.

==Personal life==

He considers his family&#x27;s native Pittsburgh metro area to be home and is a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Until 2013, Schilling lived in Medfield, Massachusetts, in Drew Bledsoe&#x27;s former home. In late 2013, Schilling&#x27;s house in Massachusetts was listed for sale at $3 million. Various personal belongings, including a golf cart, were also listed.

He is married to Shonda Schilling. They have four children, born 1995, 1997, 1999 and 2002.

Schilling has been a long time supporter and advocate for ALS-related charities. In Philadelphia, Arizona, and Boston, Schilling’s charity “Curt’s Pitch for ALS” raised money and awareness for ALS within those respective communities. Schilling and wife Shonda raised over five million dollars for ALS treatment and research. During the 2004 ALCS game 6 “bloody sock game”, knowing the cameras would be focused on his injured ankle, Schilling wrote “K ALS” on his cleat directly below the injury.

Schilling is a born-again Christian. He became an evangelical in 1997. Schilling opposes same-sex marriage and believes that each state should decide its laws on the topic rather than the federal government.

He has an extensive collection of World War II memorabilia, including &quot;numerous Nazi uniforms with swastikas&quot; and &quot;uniforms worn by various SS divisions, including Hitler&#x27;s personal bodyguards&quot;; Schilling has specified that it is &quot;not a Nazi collection. It&#x27;s a collection of World War II stuff,&quot; further stating that he doesn&#x27;t &quot;have a racist bone in (his) body&quot;.

Before the 2007 season, Schilling started a blog called 38pitches.com in which he answered fan questions, documented his starts, and rebutted press coverage about him or the team that he believed to be inaccurate. After retiring, he moved his blog to the WEEI sports radio website. After a disagreement with the station, Schilling removed it from that site. Schilling periodically contributes on the ESPN Boston website answering fan questions about the Red Sox or baseball in general.

===Cancer===
In 2014, Schilling was treated for throat cancer, specifically squamous-cell carcinoma; he announced that his cancer was in remission later that year. Schilling attributed his cancer to his use of smokeless tobacco for 30 years, and warned other MLB users of the risks.

===Conflicts with players and management===
The outspoken Schilling has engaged in several conflicts with fellow players. Schilling was publicly criticized by Phillies teammates Mitch Williams, Larry Andersen, and Danny Jackson for his conduct during the 1993 World Series. Whenever Williams, a hard-throwing closer with a penchant for unpredictability and erratic control, was on the mound, CBS television cameras caught Schilling in the dugout hiding his face with a towel. Although Schilling said he was nervous in the heat of the World Series, his teammates criticized him for being disrespectful.

Schilling has directed comments toward New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez, calling a Rodríguez tag in Game 6 of the ALCS a &quot;bush-league play&quot; on &quot;The Jim Rome Show&quot;.

During a radio show appearance on May 8, 2007, Schilling criticized Barry Bonds, stating: &quot;He admitted to cheating on his wife, cheating on his taxes and cheating on the game.&quot; Soon after, Schilling issued an apology on his blog, stating &quot;it was absolutely irresponsible and wrong to say what I did&quot;.

After the 2008 season, Schilling released a blog post blasting former teammate Manny Ramirez&#x27;s conduct before Ramirez left the Red Sox.

While with the Phillies, Schilling was a vocal critic of team management.

During a game as a Diamondback in 2003, he damaged a QuesTec camera with a bat. According to Schilling, the umpire behind the plate had said &quot;I can&#x27;t call that pitch a strike, the machine won&#x27;t let me.&quot; This led to a fine and a public exchange of insults with Major League Baseball executive Sandy Alderson, who accused Schilling of whining and wanting balls to be called strikes. In response Schilling said Alderson was &quot;ignorant to the facts and ignorant about what I said.&quot;

===Conflicts with media===
Schilling had a longstanding feud with ESPN and former &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; reporter Pedro Gomez, initially over a Gomez article that criticized then-Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter. Gomez then published a column critical of Schilling, the same day Schilling was pitching in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series. In his column, Gomez stated, &quot;During the past few days, the country...has discovered Schilling&#x27;s little secret, the one baseball insiders have known for years but has rarely surfaced into the mainstream. Schilling is something of a con man, someone more intent on polishing his personal image through whatever means possible.&quot; A year later, Gomez further angered Schilling by calling the friendship between Schilling and teammate Randy Johnson &quot;cosmetic&quot;.

In interviews in October 2004 and February 2006, Schilling, while criticizing &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; sports columnist Laura Vecsey, compared her to Gomez and sportswriter Jon Heyman:

There are a lot of her in that industry, Pedro Gomez, Joel Heyman, to name a few. People with so little skill in their profession that they need to speculate, make up, fabricate, to write something interesting enough to be printed. What makes them bad people? I am sure I cannot nail the exact reason, but I know some. Jealousy, bitterness, the need to be &#x27;different.&#x27;

In 2007, Schilling spoke out against &quot;Boston Globe&quot; sports columnist Dan Shaughnessy, who had been criticizing Schilling for the condition he showed up in for spring training, referred to him as &quot;the Big Blowhard&quot; and mocked Schilling&#x27;s blog and radio appearances. Schilling responded on a local baseball web forum and his own blog to claim to have found errors in Shaughnessy&#x27;s columns.

On April 27, 2007, broadcaster Gary Thorne said that he overheard Red Sox catcher Doug Mirabelli say that the blood on the sock used by Schilling in Game 6 of the 2004 ALCS was actually paint. Mirabelli accused Thorne of lying and a day later, after talking to Mirabelli, Thorne backed off his statement saying he misinterpreted what was intended as a joke, &quot;Having talked with him today, there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that&#x27;s not what he said, that&#x27;s not what he meant. He explained that it was in the context of the sarcasm and the jabbing that goes on in the clubhouse.&quot;

Schilling responded in his blog by saying the following:

So Gary Thorne says that Doug told him the blood was fake. Which even when he&#x27;s called out he can&#x27;t admit he lied. Doug never told Gary Thorne anything. Gary Thorne overheard something and then misreported what he overheard. Not only did he misreport it, he misinterpreted what he misreported.
===Gaming hobby===
Schilling plays the board wargame &quot;Advanced Squad Leader&quot;.

ASL has become his constant companion on road trips, and every National League city is now his playground for baseball at night and ASL in the day. (All of which has become a bonanza for ASL players of his acquaintance, who are sometimes Curt&#x27;s guests at stadiums around the country.)

Schilling&#x27;s disappointment at not being able to attend the game&#x27;s annual convention led him, along with ASL great Gary Fortenberry, to create his own, &quot;The ASL Open&quot;, which debuted the weekend of January 15, 1993, in Dallas. Schilling started a gaming publication, &quot;Fire for Effect&quot;, a bi-monthly magazine featuring &quot;some of the ASL hobby&#x27;s best writers&quot;.

When his favorite game was sold along with Avalon Hill to Hasbro, Schilling joined the small gaming company Multi-Man Publishing which maintained ASL and other Avalon Hill titles. MMP also started a new, professional publication entitled &quot;ASL Journal&quot; and contributed articles, editorials, and game scenarios.
Schilling has played &quot;EverQuest&quot; and &quot;EverQuest II&quot; and has reviewed two of the game&#x27;s many expansion packs for &quot;PC Gamer&quot; magazine. He has a custom avatar in &quot;EverQuest II&quot;, as the creators of the game have made Schilling a special online character. From June 5 to June 7, 2006, fans were able to battle a virtual Curt Schilling in the game. Every time the virtual Schilling was defeated, Sony Online Entertainment donated $5 towards ALS research. Schilling has played &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; and became a regular guest on the &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; podcast &quot;The Instance&quot;.

===Tim Wakefield illness===
On September 26, 2023, Schilling broke the news that former Boston Red Sox pitcher Tim Wakefield and his wife, Stacy, were battling cancer. Schilling had not received the family&#x27;s permission, and immediately drew backlash online and a prompt statement from the Boston Red Sox organization. Wakefield died five days later, on October 1.

===Other===
In 2015, at least two Twitter users were punished over vulgar tweets about Schilling&#x27;s then-17-year-old daughter: one lost his part-time job as a ticket seller for the Yankees, and another was suspended from Brookdale Community College. Schilling claimed at least seven others were also penalized by their jobs or athletic teams.

Schilling was selected as the commencement speaker for Worcester Polytechnic Institute&#x27;s 2010 commencement and awarded a Doctorate of Science, &quot;honoris causa&quot;.

<doc id="241657" wikidata="Q1050635" url="?curid=241657" title="LaTeX Project Public License">
<text>The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is a software license originally written for the LaTeX system. Software distributed under the terms of the LPPL can be regarded as free software; however, it is not copylefted.

Besides the LaTeX base system, the LPPL is also used for most third-party LaTeX packages. Software projects other than LaTeX rarely use it.

==Unique features of the license==
The LPPL grew from Donald Knuth&#x27;s original license for TeX, which states that the source code for TeX may be used for any purpose but a system built with it can only be called &#x27;TeX&#x27; if it strictly conforms to his canonical program. The incentive for this provision was to ensure that documents written for TeX will be readable for the foreseeable future and TeX and its extensions will still compile documents written from the early 1980s to produce output exactly as intended. Quoting Frank Mittelbach, the main author of the license: &quot;LPPL attempts to preserve the fact that something like LaTeX is a language which is used for communication, that is if you write a LaTeX document you expect to be able to send it to me and to work at my end like it does at yours&quot;.

The most unusual part of the LPPL and equally the most controversial used to be the &#x27;filename clause&#x27;: &quot;You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file.&quot; This feature made some people deny that the LPPL is a free software license. In particular the Debian community considered in 2003 excluding LaTeX from its core distribution because of this.

However, version 1.3 of the LPPL has weakened this restriction. Now it is only necessary that modified components identify themselves &quot;clearly and unambiguously&quot; as modified versions, both in the source and also when called in some sort of interactive mode. A name change of the work is still recommended, however.

In order to provide project continuity in the case that the copyright holder no longer wishes to maintain the work, maintenance can be passed on to another (or from maintainer to maintainer). This can either be declared by the copyright holder or, in the event that the copyright holder is no longer able to be contacted, by the individual taking over maintenance, with a three-month gap after their public intention to take over the maintenance. The modifying clause discussed above does not hold for the current maintainer of the work.

==Copyright holders==
The LaTeX project holds the copyright for the text of the LPPL, but it does not necessarily hold the copyright for a work released under the LPPL. The author of the work holds copyright for the work, and is responsible for enforcing any violations of the license (or not).

Unlike the works released under the LPPL, the LPPL itself is not freely modifiable. While copying and distribution is allowed, changing the text of the LPPL is not. However, it may be used as a model for other licenses provided they do not reference the LPPL.
