<text>The music of Finland can be roughly divided into folk music, classical and contemporary art music, and contemporary popular music.

The folk music of Finland belongs to a broader musical tradition, common amongst Balto-Finnic people, sung in the so-called &quot;Kalevala&quot; metre. Though folk songs of the old variety became progressively rarer in western Finland, they remained common in far eastern parts of the country, mainly Savonia and Karelia. After the publication of &quot;Kalevala&quot;, this music gained popularity again. In the west, mainstream Nordic folk music traditions prevail. The Sami people of northern Finland have their own musical traditions, known as Sami music. Finnish folk music has undergone a roots revival, and has become a part of popular music.

In the field of classical and contemporary art music, Finland has produced exceptional numbers of musicians and composers.

Contemporary popular music includes a heavy metal scene like other Nordic countries, as well as prominent rock and pop bands, jazz musicians, hip hop performers and makers of dance music. A Schlager scene with bandstand dancing shows that the local variety of tango is popular.

==Folk music==
The two major traditions of folk music in Finland are &quot;Kalevala&quot; and Nordic folk music or &quot;pelimanni&quot; (North Germanic &quot;spelman&quot;, &quot;player of music&quot;).

=== &quot;Kalevala&quot; ===
Kalevala is older. Its most important form is runonlaulanta (&quot;poem singing&quot;, or chanting), traditionally performed in a trochaic tetrametre using only the first five notes on a scale. Via alliteration, this type of singing tells stories about heroes such as Väinämöinen, Lemminkäinen, and Kullervo. The songs were memorised, not written down, and performed by a soloist, or by a soloist and a chorus in antiphony. The Vantaa Chamber Choir is an example of a choir that sings such poems in modern arrangements.
Traditional Finnish instruments include the &quot;kantele&quot;, which is a chordophone, and was used in the &#x27;Kalevala&#x27; by the hero Väinämöinen. More primitive instruments like the &quot;jouhikko&quot; (a bowed lyre) and the &quot;säkkipilli&quot; (Finnish bagpipe) had fallen into disuse, but are now finding new popularity in a folk revival.

Värttinä is a modern group more focused on &quot;Kalevala&quot; singing traditions and the &quot;kantele&quot;. 
=== Pelimanni ===

Pelimanni music is the Finnish version of Nordic folk dance music, and it is tonal. It came to Finland from Central Europe via Scandinavia in the 17th century, and in the 19th century, it replaced the &quot;Kalevala&quot;ic tradition. &quot;Pelimanni&quot; was generally played on the fiddle and clarinet. Later, the harmonium and accordions were added. Common dances in the &quot;Pelimanni&quot; traditions include: polka, mazurka, schottische, quadrille, waltz, and minuet.

A form of rhyming sleighride singing called &quot;rekilaulu&quot; also became popular in the 17th century. Despite opposition from most of the churches in Finland, rekilaulu remained popular and is today a common element in pop songs. Since the 1920s, several popular Finnish performers have used rekilaulu as an integral part of their repertoire. Early pioneers in this field of pop rekilaulu included Arthur Kylander, while Erkki Rankaviita, Kuunkuiskaajat, and Pinnin Pojat sustained the tradition.

Early in the 20th century, the region of Kaustinen became a center of innovation for &quot;Pelimanni&quot; music. Friiti Ojala and Antti Järvelä were fiddlers of the period. Konsta Jylhä and the other members of Purpuripelimannit (formed in 1946) became perhaps the most influential group of this period. Well-known Finnish folk music groups of today in the Kaustinen tradition include JPP, Frigg (although part Norwegian), and Troka. Another important folk musician of today is the accordionist Maria Kalaniemi.

Common instruments today include trumpets, horns, and whistle. Important virtuosos include Leena Joutsenlahti, Teppo Repo and Virpi Forsberg. 

In the 20th century, influences from modern music and dances such as jazz and foxtrot led to distinctively Finnish forms of dance music, such as &quot;humppa&quot; and &quot;jenkka&quot;.

=== Sami music ===
The Sami of northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway are known for highly spiritual songs called &quot;joik&quot;, reminiscent of a few types of Native American singing. The same word sometimes refers to &quot;lavlu&quot; or &quot;vuelie&quot; songs, though this is technically incorrect. Hip hop artist Amoc is noted for rapping in Inari Sami, a Sami language from the area of Inari.

== Classical and art music ==

=== Classical music ===

In the 18th century, public concerts were established in Turku and Erik Tulindberg wrote six famous string quartets. After Russia&#x27;s 1809 annexation of Finland, the cities of Viipuri and Helsinki became cultural centers and opera became popular. The first Finnish opera was written by the German composer Fredrik Pacius in 1852. Pacius also wrote &quot;Maamme/Vårt land&quot; (Our Land), Finland&#x27;s national anthem and founded Akademiska Sångföreningen in year 1838, the oldest still active choir in Finland.

In 1874, the Society for Culture and Education &quot;(Kansanvalistusseura)&quot; was founded to provide opportunities for artistic expression, beginning with the Jyväskylä festival in 1881. The festival, organized on Estonian roots, continues today. In 1883, the Helsinki University Chorus &quot;(Ylioppilaskunnan Laulajat)&quot; was founded as a Finnish-language choir amidst the mostly Swedish-speaking scene. The same year conductor Robert Kajanus founded the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra and Martin Wegelius founded what became the Sibelius Academy.
In the 1890s, Finnish nationalism based on the &quot;Kalevala&quot; spread, and Jean Sibelius became famous for his vocal symphony &quot;Kullervo&quot;. He received a grant to study poetry singers in Karelia and continued his rise as the first internationally prominent Finnish musician. In 1899 he composed &quot;Finlandia&quot;, which played an important role in Finnish independence. He remains one of Finland&#x27;s most popular national figures and national symbol.

Alongside Sibelius, national romanticism sprouted other composers who contributed in the formation of a distinct Finnish style of music. Heino Kaski was a composer of small chamber music pieces; Erkki Melartin&#x27;s output includes six symphonies; Yrjö Kilpinen composed solo songs, as well as Leevi Madetoja, and Toivo Kuula. In the 1930s composers including Uuno Klami and Yrjö Kilpinen rose to popularity. Kilpinen&#x27;s approach was somewhat nationalistic, whereas Klami had Karelian influences, leaning towards French models.

Finland had a lively classical music scene. Composers were supported by conductors such as Mikko Franck, Esa-Pekka Salonen (also a notable composer), Jukka-Pekka Saraste, Osmo Vänskä, Susanna Mälkki, Leif Segerstam and Sakari Oramo. Many Finnish singers and instrumentalists achieved international success. Among them are opera singers Martti Talvela, Karita Mattila, Matti Salminen, Soile Isokoski and Topi Lehtipuu, pianists Ralf Gothoni, Olli Mustonen, Risto Lauriala, Janne Mertanen and Paavali Jumppanen, as well as clarinettist Kari Kriikku and violinist Pekka Kuusisto. Practically all prominent Finnish musicians perform both classical and contemporary art music.

The opening of the new Finnish National Opera in 1993 and the new Helsingin Musiikkitalo in 2011 strengthened the position of classical and art music. The orchestra network in Finland might be proportionally the densest in the world, including 30 member orchestras of the Association of Finnish Symphony Orchestras.

=== Opera ===

Aino Ackté and other opera singers founded the Finnish Opera in 1911. Ackté began a festival in Savonlinna the following year; this was the precursor of the Savonlinna Opera Festival, which launched in the 1960s, shortly before the new Finnish opera became famous in the 1970s. Leevi Madetoja&#x27;s 1924 &quot;Pohjalaisia&quot;, an operatic allegory about Russian oppression during previous decades, became popular during the 1920s. At roughly the same time, Aarre Merikanto composed the opera &quot;Juha&quot; to the libretto by Aino Ackté, who rejected it and asked Leevi Madetoja to compose another version instead; Merikanto&#x27;s Juha was first performed after the composer&#x27;s death in 1958, and became regarded as an underrated masterwork.

Aulis Sallinen started a new wave of Finnish opera in the 1970s with &quot;The Horseman&quot; and &quot;The Red Line&quot;. &quot;The Red Line&quot; earned productions in Moscow, London, and New York City. Along with Sallinen&#x27;s stage works, Joonas Kokkonen&#x27;s opera &quot;The Last Temptations&quot; contributed to that era&#x27;s rise of Finnish opera music. More recent major operas by Finnish composers include among others Kaija Saariaho&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Amour de loin&quot; and &quot;Adriana mater&quot; as well as Olli Kortekangas&#x27;s &quot;Isän tyttö&quot; (&quot;Daddy&#x27;s Girl&quot;).

Since the 1960s, the Lahti Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s reputation as one of the most important Scandinavian orchestras was cemented by conductor Osmo Vänskä; this helped to cause a boom in opera&#x27;s popularity during the 1980s, rescuing a form increasingly seen as archaic elsewhere. The Savonlinna Opera Festival reopened in 1967.

Martti Talvela, Karita Mattila and Jorma Hynninen became international opera stars, while composers like Kalevi Aho, Olli Kortekangas, Paavo Heininen, Aulis Sallinen, Einojuhani Rautavaara, Atso Almila and Ilkka Kuusisto composed successful operas.

===Contemporary art music===
The first wave of post-classical music in Finland came about in the 1920s with modernists Aarre Merikanto, Väinö Raitio and Sulho Ranta. However, this movement was tamed by the growing nationalistic tendency in the arts before the Second World War. In the 1940s, Erik Bergman and Joonas Kokkonen gained popularity and added technical innovations to Finnish music. A generation of Finnish composers turned to modernism, such as Einojuhani Rautavaara and Usko Meriläinen, while the neoclassical style found voice in the music of Einar Englund. The 1950s saw an increase in international attention on Finnish music and helped modernize Finnish composing.

The forming of the &quot;Ears Open!&quot; society in 1977 turned out to be the major change in Finnish art music. From its circles emerged composers and musicians who achieved worldwide success, notably conductor-composer Esa-Pekka Salonen, and composers Eero Hämeenniemi, Kaija Saariaho, Magnus Lindberg and Jouni Kaipainen. The early &quot;Ears Open!&quot; society followed Central European modernism along the lines of Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen, but also showed interest in post-war Polish School composers such as Witold Lutoslawski. &quot;Ears Open!&quot; was followed by the forming of Avanti! Chamber Orchestra in 1983, which offered a platform for composers and instrumentalists to introduce new works and stylistic flows in Finland.

In the 21st century, the modernist movement waned, but is still represented by composers such as Veli-Matti Puumala and Lotta Wennäkoski. Juhani Nuorvala is a rare minimalist, while Osmo Tapio Räihälä and Sebastian Fagerlund lean more towards post-modernism.

Performance of contemporary art music blossomed in Finland, with specialized groups including Uusinta Chamber Ensemble and Zagros. The most important stages for contemporary art music are the established festivals Time of Music in Viitasaari, Musica nova Helsinki and Tampere Biennale, as well as the Klang Concert Series in Helsinki.

===Experimental===
Classical elements and mysterious soundscapes characterize the compositions of Finnish film score composer Diana Ringo. Popular singer Anna Eriksson creates experimental music and film scores.

==Popular music==
=== Iskelmä ===

Iskelmä (coined directly from the German word &quot;Schlager&quot;, meaning &quot;hit&quot;) is a traditional Finnish word for a light popular song. Georg Malmstén started his career in the 1930s. Others, such as Dallapé, incorporated then-novel jazz elements. After World War II but before rock and roll, names such as Olavi Virta or Tapio Rautavaara were popular singers, and Toivo Kärki and Reino Helismaa were popular songwriters. Foreign musical genres such as tango found domestic audiences. Some of the most acclaimed Finnish chanteuses of this time period were Laila Kinnunen, Carola, Annikki Tähti, Brita Koivunen and Vieno Kekkonen.

From the late 1960s, Irwin Goodman ( Antti Hammarberg) combined &quot;iskelmä&quot; and protest songs, gaining popularity with humorous tunes penned by Vexi Salmi, who also wrote for other Finnish artists. Juha &quot;Watt&quot; Vainio was another popular songwriter, known for Finnish renditions of many international hits, but for his own songs and performing in his own right. In the 1970s, &quot;Finnhits&quot; compilation records of various artists continued in the &quot;iskelmä&quot; tradition. Rural-flavoured &quot;humppa&quot; became a successful variation of &quot;iskelmä&quot;, later parodied by Eläkeläiset. Other popular Finnish &quot;iskelmä&quot; singers are Katri Helena, Danny (a.k.a. Ilkka Lipsanen), Fredi, Eino Grön, Erkki Junkkarinen, Frederik (a.k.a. Ilkka Sysimetsä), Marion Rung, Tapani Kansa, Kirka (a.k.a. Kirill Babitzin), Matti ja Teppo, Jari Sillanpää, and Kikka Sirén.

The annual Eurovision Song Contest is avidly followed in Finland and in 2006 Finland won with the melodic heavy rock band Lordi.

Like Finnish music in general, &quot;iskelmä&quot; is written mostly in minor keys. The melodies have a distinguishable Finnish &quot;flavour&quot; that is somewhat related to Russian and Italian melodies and harmonies although Scandinavian and Anglo-American influence can also be heard.

&quot;Iskelmä&quot; music is essentially dance music, and it is mostly performed on dancing stages and halls around the country. The best known and perhaps most loved and respected dance is the tango, which originated in Argentina. Notably, the annual Finnish contest for &quot;iskelmä&quot; artists is &quot;Tangomarkkinat&quot;, meaning &quot;The Tango Marketplace&quot;; many of the stars of contemporary &quot;iskelmä&quot; have won this competition and it is a major spectacle in Finland, comparable with the Sanremo Music Festival in Italy.

Iskelmä is typically non-urban music and its greatest popularity is situated to the countryside and smaller cities.

Traditionally accordion has been the major instrument in iskelmä music and it is still played, but has in most cases been replaced by guitar, electric piano and synthesizer. These, with drums, electric bass and occasional use of saxophone form the basic instrumentation of &quot;iskelmä&quot;.

=== Rock music ===
Rock arrived in Finland in the 1950s. Founded in the 1960s, Love Records was one of the first domestic record labels dedicated to Finnish rock music, even though the label&#x27;s roster also included jazz and political songs. During the late 1960s, Blues Section, a group inspired by Jimi Hendrix and The Who gained a reputation as &quot;the first Finnish band of international quality&quot;. Another band that gained some reputation was Apollo that later featured jazz-drummer Edward Vesala. The early work had little typical Finnish &quot;flavour&quot; and most bands covered music by international bands. Blues Section later developed into internationally acknowledged &quot;superband&quot; Wigwam, featuring English singer Jim Pembroke, who wrote many of their songs. Originally they also played songs with Finnish lyrics written by Jukka Gustafsson such as the classical &quot;Luulosairas&quot;.
During the 1970s, progressive rock groups Wigwam and Tasavallan Presidentti received critical acclaim in the United Kingdom, but fame evaded them. Pekka Streng was one of the pioneers of Finnish rock music via his progressive spiritual folkrock and Finnish lyrics. The 2000s experienced a Streng-renaissance and one of his songs became an international club hit. Hard-rock group Hurriganes was popular in Sweden as well as in Finland. Hector, Juice Leskinen, Dave Lindholm and many other successful artists of the 1970s sang in Finnish, which continued in later years. During the 1970s these artists birthed &quot;suomirock&quot;.

Suomirock literally means Finnish rock music. However, its meaning is more specific, covering rock/pop music with Finnish lyrics. As a genre it started in the 1980s following the punk rock movement. It is a form of rock music that is recognizably Finnish with Finnish lyrics. A more general and recent term is &quot;suomipop&quot;. The boundaries between what is considered &quot;rock&quot; and &quot;pop&quot; blurred and depend upon personal preference. Traditionally in &quot;iskelmä&quot; the performers did not write their songs, while in the rock scene the singer-songwriter ruled. In the 2000s new performers such as &quot;Idols&quot; songcontest winner Ari Koivunen performed even heavy rock in the &quot;iskelmä&quot; manner, which used to be typical only in &quot;iskelmä&quot;-scene.

The punk movement arrived in Finland in 1977 and influenced Finnish youth culture. Pelle Miljoona was the most famous Finnish punk singer. Terveet Kädet started the hardcore punk-wave. Eppu Normaali also started during this period, (later to change its style from punk to rock/pop). At the same time, Finland had a massive movement of Elvis and rockabilly fans, later parodied by Finnish lo-fi punk band Liimanarina.

In the 1980s, most favoured artists were punkish Dingo and heavy-hearted Yö (), both singing their lyrics in Finnish and being from Pori. In the underground, Ismo Alanko, considered by many as the foremost Finnish rock lyricist, gained a legendary status with his punkish groups Hassisen Kone and Sielun Veljet. Kauko Röyhkä was another literate underground icon, leaning musically towards Velvet Underground. The 1980s showed short international fame for punk style glam rock band Hanoi Rocks. Hanoi Rocks and Smack have been cited as an influence by major American bands such as Guns N&#x27; Roses and Foo Fighters.

Heavy metal was popular in Finland during the 1980s, producing groups like Stone, the latter being a fondly remembered speed metal act. Hardcore punk is also popular in Finland, including bands such as Endstand, Abduktio, I Walk the Line, and Lighthouse Project.
In the early 1990s Finnish rock parody group the Leningrad Cowboys flourished. It was an international rock comedy band that grew out of the Finnish comedy band Sleepy Sleepers. Its members appeared in Aki Kaurismäki&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Leningrad Cowboys Go America. They&quot; performed live at the MTV Music Awards in New York City in 1994, together with the full Red Army Choir, performing &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;. This was the biggest TV audience for any Finnish music artist ever. Leningrad Cowboys were famous for outrageous outfits including ridiculous rock-a-billy hairdos and ultra-pointed shoes. The band remained popular in parts of Europe.

Finnish bands tend to write lyrics in English to broaden their audience. However, 1990s bands such as Apulanta, Miljoonasade, Ultra Bra and the shamanic art-punk group CMX found success with Finnish lyrics. The hard-to-define electronic country garage rock group 22 Pistepirkko got excellent reviews in the Finnish rock press and reached cult status in Central Europe. Other notable Finnish cult rock groups of this era include the psychedelic band Hendrixian Kingston Wall that was influenced by shamanism and genres of electronic dance music, and equally psychedelic but gothic, gloomy, and heavy, Mana Mana.

A band that enjoyed critical and commercial success in the 2000s is The Rasmus. After eleven years and several domestic releases, the band gained attention in Europe. Their &quot;Dead Letters&quot; (2003) album sold 1.5 million units worldwide and garnered eight gold and five platinum album designations. The single &quot;In the Shadows&quot; placed on Top 10 charts in eleven countries and was the most played video on MTV Europe for 2005. The Helsinki natives released their follow-up album, &quot;Hide From The Sun&quot;, domestically in 2005, r eaching the U.S. in 2006. To promote the U.S. release, the band toured with the Welsh band Lostprophets. The album &quot;Black Roses&quot; was released worldwide on 29 September 2008. It was produced by Desmond Child and the first single was called &quot;Livin&#x27; in a World Without You&quot;. The band continued in the 2020s and competed in Eurovision Song Contest 2022.

===Heavy metal===

Finland is known for heavy metal acts, including from the death metal, black metal, doom metal, folk metal, power metal, and symphonic metal subgenres.

Finland hosts a strong underground doom metal scene more focused on the depressive mood of the genre, evoking intense grief. The bands play with slow tempos and melodic tones, creating an atmosphere of darkness and melancholia. This scene was kick-started by Rigor Mortis (which, due to an older US band with the same name, changed their name to Spiritus Mortis), which originated in 1987. Notable bands include Reverend Bizarre, Minotauri, Dolorian, Shape of Despair, Swallow the Sun, Thergothon, Skepticism and Unholy.

In the later 1990s the symphonic metal group Apocalyptica played Metallica cover songs as cello quartets and sold half a million records worldwide. The recently retired Timo Rautiainen &amp; Trio Niskalaukaus were one of Finland&#x27;s most popular metal acts in the early 2000s, after leaving late 1980s – early 1990s cult band Lyijykomppania. Children&#x27;s power metal band Hevisaurus became popular in Finland.

Finnish metal bands attained worldwide success within the underground metal scene. Examples of such bands include Stratovarius and Sonata Arctica, and Children of Bodom.
Nightwish is considered a pioneer of symphonic metal that mixes in power metal and gothic metal and had Tarja Turunen, a classical soprano, as its vocalist until 2005. The band received platinum and gold certifications for its albums sales in many countries and became the third best selling Finnish artist. The band was nominated for awards and took home 11 Emma-gala awards, the Echo award, the Mtv Europe music award, the World music award and the Metal Storm award. In 2000 the band participated in the Finnish qualification for the Eurovision Song Contest, reaching second place.

Kotiteollisuus was one of Finland&#x27;s most popular bands, producing one platinum and several gold albums and winning Emma-awards in 2003 and 2005 for best metal record (&quot;Helvetistä itään&quot;) and best DVD (&quot;Kotiteollisuus&quot;), respectively.

Finnish hard rock band Lordi won the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest with a record 292 points, Finland&#x27;s first-ever victory. They submitted &quot;Hard Rock Hallelujah&quot;, and they celebrated their win with a free concert in Market Square in Helsinki, on 26 May 2006. They broke the world record for karaoke singing with about 80,000 voices singing &quot;Hard Rock Hallelujah&quot;. Lordi was one of the most watched competitors of the Eurovision Song Contest internationally, because the band aroused positive media interest, while some foreigners accused Lordi of satanism.
From the beginning of 2000, HIM reached greater sales and more international success than any other band to come from Finland. Going gold with their first official American release &quot;Dark Light&quot;, of which two singles, &quot;Wings of a Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Killing Loneliness&quot;, reached number one and two, respectively, on the Finnish Singles Chart. The former cracked the top ten in the UK. Several Finnish bands have followed the lead of that band; Entwine, Lullacry, and Poisonblack are such bands.

Heavy metal group Blind Channel finished sixth in Eurovision Song Contest 2021 with their song &quot;Dark Side&quot;.

Other well-known metal bands are Amorphis, Beherit, Impaled Nazarene, Throne of Chaos, Turisas and Ensiferum.

=== Hip-hop ===

Finland hip-hop bands emerged during the late 1990s to early 2000s. One of the first Finnish Hip Hop records with lyrics in English was recorded at Vernissa (C) Manus / (P) Johanna Kustannus 1991 by Damn The Band. Later Finland offered Nuera with MC&#x27;s Skem (Henry Kaprali) and Dream (Petri Laurila) from Tampere region. Nuera&#x27;s first release was in 1992. Same guys, together with DJ K2 were also behind a hip-hop based radio show on YleX. The first popular hip-hop band to break the taboo of making rap lyrics in Finnish (rapping in Finnish was not regarded as serious business because the first artists to do this in the early 1990s such as Raptori, Nikke T and Pääkköset were humorous project and were popular mostly among children) was Fintelligens arguably one of the most successful hip hop bands in Finland. Let&#x27;s not forget about Ceebrolistics, their first cassette single &quot;Sping&quot; was released in 1995 their lyrics has been both in Finnish and English. Few other important popular but underground acts were MC Taakibörsta, Notkea Rotta and Paleface just to mention a few from the same era.
Today rap music is one of the major genres of Finnish pop-music and there are many artists, who have reached wide popularity. Still it can be said, that rap-scene is primarily an underground-movement. But even independent artists such as ASA with often political and critical lyrics are quite popular. ASA&#x27;s &quot;leijonaa mä metsästän&quot;-album was the third on Finnish albumchart in 2005. Finnish rap-artists, such as Paleface with English lyrics have not attained international success. An exception to this is /breakbeat-/electro-/ hiphop-band Bomfunk MC&#x27;s, who with their MC Raymond Ebanks became popular in Central Europe, as they had the most sold European hit single of 2000, &quot;Freestyler&quot; along with trance music act Darude&#x27;s international hit &quot;Sandstorm&quot;.

In 2023 hip-hop artist Käärijä represented Finland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 and placed first in the televote but second in overall.

=== Pop music ===

In the 1990s, a popular new trend was so-called Eurodance music and this style also had Finnish followers, many of which however are today quite forgotten. A couple of bands also wrote their lyrics in English, but didn&#x27;t make it on the international music market. To mention few artists, there were Hausmylly, Aikakone and Movetron.

Some contemporary Pop/Rock singers who emerged in the 2000s, such as Maija Vilkkumaa, Sanni Kurkisuo, Jenni Vartiainen, Anssi Kela, Irina, Chisu, Anna Puu, Anna Eriksson, Hanna Pakarinen and Antti Tuisku, and pop rock groups such as Scandinavian Music Group, and PMMP, are popular in Finland. They all primarily sing in Finnish, which may contribute to their relatively low international profile. Antti Tuisku has become the most popular and best-selling artist to emerge from &quot;Idols&quot;, the Finnish version of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. Erika Vikman is another popular electropop singer who achieved wide recognition in Finland with her 2020 hit &quot;Syntisten pöytä&quot; (The Sinner&#x27;s Table). Poets of the Fall is an example of a Finnish pop/rock band that sings in English.

Since the late 1990s and early 2000s, female artists have become more visible as performers and songwriters. Singer-songwriter Chisu is a good example of this phenomenon penning songs that can be considered classics, along with Eppu Normaali, Tuomari Nurmio.

A number of &quot;iskelmä&quot;, rock- and pop-songs attained classic status, outlasting &quot;hits of today&quot;. Although the differences between pop, rock and &quot;iskelmä&quot; are notable in social signification – stereotypically &quot;iskelmä is&quot; music for older and rural people, while rock and pop are for youth and urbanites–the boundaries between these genres are not always clear. This seems to be true especially in popular songs that are endlessly performed in original form, or rearranged into new musical idioms and dialects.

=== Contemporary folk music ===
The Finnish roots revival began in the 1960s. The Ilmajoki Music Festival and Kaustinen Folk Music Festival became musical centers for the country and helped revitalize traditional Finnish folk music. &quot;Runosong&quot; was revitalized by a new generation of performers, including Reijo Kela, Kimmo Pohjonen and Heikki Laitinen, who created a &quot;kalevala&quot; performance art piece.

The International Folk Music Festival, established in 1968 in Kaustinen. It became a major event in the popularization of Finnish folk. The 1970s saw further revival of Finnish folk music, including artists like Konsta Jylhä, JPP and Värttinä. Jylhä and his Purppuripelimannit band did the most to popular the scene.

Some non-Sami artists, including Enigma and Jan Garbarek, used &quot;joik&quot; and other &quot;Sami&quot; styles in their music, while Marie Boine of Norway is probably the most internationally famous &quot;Sami&quot; star. 1996&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Suden Aika&quot; by Tellu Turkka saw a further return of &quot;runosong&quot;.

The Finnish bagpipe, the säkkipilli, though previously extinct, was revived by folk musicians such as Petri Prauda.

In the 2000s, an underground-movement of new folk music came out. Notables include artists such as Joose Keskitalo, Kuusumun Profeetta, and Paavoharju. Despite their Finnish lyrics bands have claimed international recognition. Well-known artists J. Karjalainen and Pauli Hanhiniemi have turned to folk music.

Another new phenomenon of the 2000s is suomireggae. With Finnish lyrics and moral and spiritual content artists such as Soul-Captain Band, Kapteeni Ä-ni, Jukka Poika and Raappana have attained wider popularity.

Underground scenes of various genres are lively, while many bands and artists defy genre boundaries. A good example is underground rap artist ASA (formerly known as MC Avain), who has used folk artists as the accompanying band.

=== Electronic music ===

In electronic music, Jori Hulkkonen, Jimi Tenor, and Pan Sonic have had underground success worldwide. Finland has given birth to international trance DJs such as DJ Orkidea, Alex Kunnari, DJ Proteus, JS16, Super8 &amp; Tab, Yotto, and Paavo Siljamäki. Other notable Finnish artists are Mesak, Imatran Voima, Mr Velcro Fastener, EODEM, Luomo a.k.a. Vladislav Delay, Brothomstates, Lackluster, Pan Sonic, and Ovuca. Electronic music labels include Sähkö Recordings, Kahvi Records, Dum Records (run by Kimmo Rapatti a.k.a. Mono Junk) and Jyväskylä&#x27;s Rikos Records.

The pioneer of Finnish electronic music is Erkki Kurenniemi who built DIMI synthesizers in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Finnish underground psy trance culture is mostly active in the Helsinki metro area. The Finnish style (suomisaundi) of psy trance music is known worldwide and has notable international audiences, for example in Japan and Russia. Main characters in Finnish psy trance are Mullet Mohawk, Texas Faggott and Squaremeat. The most popular Finnish electronica artist is Darude (Ville Virtanen), who gained international success with his chart-topping &quot;Sandstorm&quot;, and the following hit album &quot;Before the Storm&quot;. His music is a combination of hard house and progressive trance. The Finnish Hard Dance scene gained some following, primarily due to Helsinki-based DJ Proteus winning the title of Best DJ at The Hard Dance Awards in 2004 and 2005. Finland has a popular and internationally recognised Freeform hardcore scene, with the FINRG label enjoying success in the UK, Australia, and more recently Canada and the United States.

In experimental electronica, noise and ambient electronic music, Finland is represented by Petri Kuljuntausta, Pink Twins, Ihokas, Rihmasto, Nemesis, Niko Skorpio, Dystopia, Ozone Player, Winterplanet, Corporate 09, Moya81, and Outer Space Alliance.

=== Jazz ===

Jazz came to Finland along with American immigrants in 1926. One of the first Finnish jazz bands was Dallapé which is still active Klaus Salmi, Eugen Malmstén, Erik Lindström, Toivo Kärki, Ossi Aalto and Kauko Viitamäki were some of the first professional Finnish jazz musicians. Jazz bands started doing dance gigs. Initially the popular genres were accordion jazz, ragtime, swing, jazz schlager and waltz.

Finnish jazz imitated foreign models until the 1960s when a new generation started to combine American tradition and Finnish folk influences. Artists included Esa Pethman, Heikki Sarmanto, Eero Koivistoinen and Henrik Otto Donner. Edward Vesala&#x27;s and Paroni Paakkunainen&#x27;s Soulset band managed to succeed in international contests and festivals. The first Finnish jazz festival, Pori Jazz, launched in 1966.

In the 1970s, musicians began to mix jazz, funk and progressive rock. Pekka Pöyry, Sakari Kukko, Pekka Pohjola, Jukka Tolonen and Olli Ahvenlahti were some of the best-known Finnish jazz musicians. Sakari Kukko&#x27;s Piirpauke played jazz that was influenced by Finnish folk music and progressive rock. The music of Wigwam and Tasavallan Presidentti is usually regarded as progressive rock, but included elements of jazz fusion. Live concerts often included long solos. The UMO Jazz Orchestra was founded in 1975 and gave opportunity to many Finnish jazz musicians to earn a living.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Finnish jazz became more internationally recognized. Jukka Linkola, Jukka Perko and Tapani Rinne with his Rinneradio combined various musical styles. Iiro Rantala, Raalmi Eskelinen and Eerik Siikasaari founded Trio Töykeät in 1988 and the band attained worldwide interest. Other important jazz musicians from this era are Severi Pyysalo, Lenni-Kalle Taipale, Verneri Pohjola, Markus Ketola and Anna-Mari Kähärä. Martti &quot;Mape&quot; Lappalainen founded Espoo Big Band and April Jazz festival in the 1980s.

After the 1990s, Finnish jazz evolved in different directions.Samplers were used to create more unique sounds. The Five Corners Quintet, U-Street All Stars and Quintessence played nu-jazz with electronic and pop influences. Oddarrang, Dalindéo, Mopo, Teemu Viinikainen, Timo Lassy, Jukka Eskola, Manuel Dunkel and Mikko Innanen represent the future of Finnish jazz.

Walston was born on November 2, 1914, in Laurel, Mississippi, the second son and youngest of three children born to lumberjack Harry Rex Walston and Camilla &quot;Mittie&quot; (née Kimbrell) Walston. 

He started acting at an early age, beginning his tenure as a spear carrier rounding out productions at many New Orleans theaters. He mostly played small roles with stock companies, where he not only starred in traveling shows, but also worked at a movie theater, selling tickets and cleaning the stage floors. His family moved to Dallas, Texas, where he joined a repertory theater company under Margo Jones in 1938. He stayed at the Houston Civic Theater six years, &quot;averaging 12 roles a year.&quot;

==Career==
===1945–1957===
Walston was popular with Margo Jones&#x27; team of actors before he traveled to Cleveland, Ohio, where he spent three years with the Cleveland Play House. He then traveled to New York City, where he made his Broadway debut in a 1945 production of Maurice Evans&#x27;s &quot;The G.I. Hamlet&quot;. Three years later, Walston became one of the first members admitted to the newly formed Actors Studio.

In 1949, he appeared in the short-lived play &quot;Mrs. Gibbons&#x27; Boys&quot;, directed by George Abbott, who later cast him as Satan (who bore the name &quot;Mr. Applegate&quot;) in the 1955 musical &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; opposite Gwen Verdon as his sexy aide Lola. The chemistry between the two was such that they both garnered critical success and won awards for their roles. After a decade in New York theater, he won a Tony Award. 

He starred as Luther Billis in the 1951 London production of &quot;South Pacific&quot;. He reprised that role in the 1958 film adaptation. He and Juanita Hall (as Bloody Mary) were the only cast members to appear in both the stage and movie versions. Additional Broadway credits included &quot;The Front Page&quot;, &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot;, &quot;Richard III&quot;, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, and &quot;House of Flowers&quot;. In 1957, actress and producer Katharine Cornell placed him in a role on Broadway in Robert E. Sherwood&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize winning play about the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, &quot;There Shall Be No Night&quot;. The play was adapted for television for a &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; production. He had a prominent role in the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein musical &quot;Me and Juliet&quot;, portraying the stage manager of the musical-within-the-musical, but his character did not participate in any of the musical numbers.

===1958–1979===
Walston reprised his role in the 1958 film version of &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;. His other films included &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot;; &quot;South Pacific&quot;; &quot;Say One for Me&quot;; &quot;Tall Story&quot;; &quot;Portrait in Black&quot;; &quot;The Apartment&quot;; &quot;Convicts 4&quot;; &quot;Wives and Lovers&quot;; &quot;Who&#x27;s Minding the Store?&quot;; &quot;Kiss Me, Stupid&quot;; &quot;Caprice&quot;; &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;; &quot;The Sting&quot;; &quot;Silver Streak&quot;; and &quot;Get a Clue&quot;. 

He narrated many United States Department of Defense and Atomic Energy Commission (now United States Department of Energy) films about nuclear experiments, including the Operation Hardtack I nuclear test film series of 1958. He guest starred on numerous television programs, including &quot;The Shirley Temple Show&quot;, &quot;The Americans&quot;, and a television version of &quot;Going My Way&quot;.

Walston achieved his greatest success as the title character (Uncle Martin) on &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; from 1963 to 1966, alongside co-star Bill Bixby. The two immediately became close friends. The show was a top ten hit in its first season,still in the top 30 in its second, dropping to 45th in its third and final season. The success of &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; typecast Walston and he had difficulty finding serious roles after the show&#x27;s cancellation. He returned to character actor status in the 1970s and 1980s, and guest starred in such series as &quot;Custer&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, &quot;The Rookies&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Ellery Queen&quot;, &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, and &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, again with Bixby, in which Walston played Jasper the Magician in an episode called &quot;My Favorite Magician&quot;.

=== 1980–1992 ===
From 1980 to 1992, Walston starred in 14 films, including &quot;Galaxy of Terror&quot; and &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (as well as the 1986 television adaptation) as Mr. Hand. In a 1999 interview, Walston said that he was happy and relieved that when he walked down the street, young fans shouted at him &quot;Mr. Hand&quot; because he had finally torn away from his &quot;Martian&quot; role. In 1984, Walston played a judge on an episode of &quot;Night Court&quot;. Six years later, he made a guest appearance on an episode of &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. He later was hired for the role of Judge Henry Bone on &quot;Picket Fences&quot;; the character was originally a recurring role, but Walston proved to be so popular the character was later upgraded to a starring role. In the first season episode, &quot;Remembering Rosemary&quot;, Judge Bone wears a Martian costume with antennae to a Halloween party as a nod to Walston&#x27;s infamous role as Uncle Martin.

In 1985, Walston made a brief appearance in the opening credits of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s series &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, as a caveman acting out a story for his tribe. He appeared in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; as Boothby, head groundskeeper at Starfleet Academy in San Francisco, and reprised the role twice on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. In 1988, he guest starred in an episode of the popular horror-fantasy show &quot;Friday the 13th: The Series&quot;, as a bitter, elderly comic-book artist who uses a demonically cursed comic book to transform himself into a killer robot and murder his erstwhile enemies. In 1992, Walston played the role of Candy in the big-screen remake of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; with Gary Sinise and John Malkovich. He also made a cameo appearance as a barman in Madonna&#x27;s Deeper and Deeper video.

=== 1993–2000 ===
Walston reunited with Sinise in the miniseries adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Stand&quot;.
He appeared in an AT&amp;T long distance TV commercial in 1995, in which his dialogue implied he was Uncle Martin from Mars, looking for good rates to talk to fellow Martians living in the United States.

Walston received three Emmy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his work on &quot;Picket Fences&quot;, winning twice, in 1995 and 1996. CBS cancelled the show after four seasons in 1996. Walston made a guest appearance in an episode of &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot; entitled &quot;Remember Me&quot;, in which he portrayed the father of Jake Slicker, who was stricken with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Walston played Grandfather Walter Addams in &quot;Addams Family Reunion&quot; (1998). The next year, he appeared in the film remake of his hit series, &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; (1999) in the role of Armitan. He appeared in the &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; episode, &quot;The Face on the Barroom Floor&quot;, which aired on October 15, 2000.

Walston made a cameo in the &quot;7th Heaven&quot; episode, &quot;One Hundred&quot;, which aired on January 29, 2001, four weeks after his death. His final film role was in the independent film &quot;Early Bird Special&quot;, which was released later that year.

==Personal life and death==
Walston married Ruth Calvert on November 3, 1943. The couple had one daughter, Katharine Ann.

In 1994, Walston was diagnosed with lupus, and as a result, worked less frequently in his final years. On January 1, 2001, Walston died at his home at Beverly Hills, California, at the age of 86.

<text>Geranium&quot; × &quot;magnificum, the purple cranesbill, is a species of hardy flowering herbaceous perennial plant in the genus &quot;Geranium&quot;, family Geraniaceae. The multiplication symbol × indicates that it is the result of hybridisation, in this case between &quot;Geranium platypetalum&quot; and &quot;Geranium ibericum&quot;. Growing into a clump high and broad, it has the decorative, deeply-lobed leaves typical of the genus &quot;Geranium&quot;. Violet-blue flowers with darker veins are borne relatively briefly in early summer. Extremely hardy, to below , it is suitable for cultivation throughout all temperate regions. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<doc id="242844" wikidata="Q3367122" url="?curid=242844" title="Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose">
<text>The sentence &quot;Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose&quot; was written by Gertrude Stein as part of the 1913 poem &quot;Sacred Emily&quot;, which appeared in the 1922 book &quot;Geography and Plays&quot;. In that poem, the first &quot;Rose&quot; is the name of a person. Stein later used variations on the sentence in other writings, and the shortened form &quot;A rose is a rose is a rose&quot; is among her most famous quotations, often interpreted as meaning &quot;things are what they are&quot;, a statement of the law of identity, &quot;A is A.&quot; 

In Stein&#x27;s view, the sentence expresses the fact that simply using the name of a thing already invokes the imagery and emotions associated with it, an idea also intensively discussed in the problem of universals debate where Peter Abelard and others used the &quot;rose&quot; as an example concept. As the quotation diffused through her own writing, and the culture at large. In &quot;Four in America&quot;, Stein wrote, &quot;Now listen! I&#x27;m no fool. I know that in daily life we don&#x27;t go around saying &#x27;is a ... is a ... is a ...&#x27; Yes, I&#x27;m no fool; but I think that in that line the rose is red for the first time in English poetry for a hundred years.&quot;

She said to an audience at Oxford University that the statement referred to the fact that when the Romantics used the word &quot;rose&quot;, it had a direct relationship to an actual rose. For later periods in literature this would no longer be true. The eras following Romanticism, notably the modern era, use the word rose to refer to the actual rose, yet they also imply, through the use of the word, the archetypical elements of the romantic era.

==Mentions of &quot;rose&quot; in &quot;Sacred Emily&quot;==
The following lines appear at widely separated places in &quot;Sacred Emily&quot;:
* &quot;It is rose in hen.&quot;
* &quot;Jack Rose Jack Rose.&quot;
* &quot;Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.&quot;

== Versions by others ==

*&quot;Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.&quot; (&quot;Sacred Emily&quot;, &quot;Geography and Plays&quot;)
*&quot;Do we suppose that all she knows is that a rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.&quot; (&quot;Operas and Plays&quot;)
*&quot;... she would carve on the tree Rose is a Rose is a Rose is a Rose is a Rose until it went all the way around.&quot; (&quot;The World is Round&quot;)
*&quot;A rose tree may be a rose tree may be a rosy rose tree if watered.&quot; (&quot;Alphabets and Birthdays&quot;)
*&quot;Indeed a rose is a rose makes a pretty plate...&quot; (&quot;Stanzas in Meditation&quot;)
*&quot;When I said.
:A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.
:And then later made that into a ring I made poetry and what did I do I caressed completely caressed and addressed a noun.&quot; (&quot;Lectures in America&quot;)
*&quot;Civilization begins with a rose. A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose. It continues with blooming and it fastens clearly upon excellent examples.&quot; (&quot;As Fine as Melanctha&quot;)
*&quot;Lifting belly can please me because it is an occupation I enjoy.
:Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.
:In print on top.&quot; (&quot;Bee Time Vine&quot;)

== Variations by others ==

* &quot;A rose is a rose is a rose&quot; and its variants have been contrasted with Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.&quot;
* The sentence was heavily promoted by Stein&#x27;s life partner Alice B. Toklas; for example, she sold plates with the sentence going all the way around.
* It is told that Picasso answered to somebody asking the meaning of his paintings: &quot;Go in the garden and ask the rose its meaning.&quot;
* Robert Frost alludes to Stein&#x27;s sentence in his poem &quot;The Rose Family&quot;, from the 1929 collection &quot;West-Running Brook&quot;.
* &quot;Evidente y secreto, como el diamante, como el agua, como el desnudo, como la rosa&quot; (Juan Ramón Jiménez, Madrid: Sánchez Cuesta, 1929)
* The sentence was parodied by Ernest Hemingway after a brief time in Paris seeking editorial suggestions for his writing: &quot;a stone is a stein is a rock is a boulder is a pebble.&quot; This also appears in his 1940 novel &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, in which there is yet another parody: &quot;a rose is a rose is an onion.&quot; After a (perhaps bitter) falling out, the sentence becomes, &quot;a bitch is a bitch is a bitch is a bitch.&quot;
* The sentence appears in the 1952 musical film &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, in the musical number &quot;Moses Supposes&quot;. While parodying a dialogue coach, the characters of Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown sing: &quot;...A Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose is / A rose is what Moses supposes his toes is / Couldn&#x27;t be a lily or a taffy daphi dilli / It&#x27;s gotta be a rose cuz it rhymes with mose!&quot;
* The sentence appears in the 1952 Charlie Chaplin film &quot;Limelight&quot;. Chaplin&#x27;s character expresses it as &quot;The meaning of anything is merely other words for the same thing. After all, a rose is a rose is a rose. That&#x27;s not bad. It should be quoted.&quot;
* Aldous Huxley paraphrases the quotation in his 1954 book &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;, writing &quot;A rose is a rose is a rose. But these chair legs were chair legs were St. Michael and all angels.&quot; In his 1958 book, &quot;Brave New World Revisited&quot;, Huxley also referenced the quotation, writing, &quot;An apple is an apple is an apple, whereas the moon is the moon is the moon.&quot;
* William Carlos Williams in a poem &quot;The Pink Locust&quot;, appearing in his 1955 collection &quot;Journey to Love&quot;, quotes &quot;a rose is a rose/ is a rose&quot; as emblematic of the poet&#x27;s self-deprecation in relation to life. Williams regards the phrase as a slogan of poetic tautology, denying the value of the creative act: the poet feels impotent and recognizes in her art merely a banal repetition of the words we use every day to represent the unrepresentable richness of the natural world. But the following lines of the poem offer an alternative view, one which Williams re-affirmed throughout his career: &quot;A rose &quot;is&quot; a rose/ and the poem equals it/ if it be well made.&quot;

<text>Joseph Featherston or Featherstone (July 22, 1843 – July 17, 1913) was a Canadian Liberal Party politician, livestock advocate and farmer.

His career consisted of being a farmer and thoroughbred dealer in Toronto Township. He was president of the Dominion Live Stock Association in 1887 and 1st vice president of the Dominion Live Stock Insurance Company from 1887 – 1888. He also served as president of the Canadian Swine Breeders Association from 1890 – 1891. He served as a councillor, deputy reeve and reeve before entering federal politics.

He was chosen as a Liberal candidate in Peel County to contest the general election for the House of Commons in 1891 against the sitting Conservative member William Armstrong McCulla. Featherston won that election with a 54 majority, in what has been described as a &quot;keen and exciting contest.&quot; That election was declared void; a by-election which was held on February 11, 1892, gave Featherston a majority of 133.

The next election Featherston participated in was against A. F. Campbell, publisher of the &quot;Brampton Conservator&quot;. Featherston triumphed by a majority of 466, or 1891 to 1425. This marked the first time any Peel candidate won by a margin of over 100. Featherston&#x27;s streak ended in 1900, to Richard Blain.

<text>Lampang (, ; Northern Thai: ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;), situated in upper northern Thailand. The old name of Lampang was &quot;Khelang Nakhon&quot;.

==Geography==
Lampang is in the broad river valley of the Wang River, surrounded by mountains. In Mae Mo district lignite is found and mined in open pits. To the north of the province is the high Doi Luang.

Within the province are Chae Son and Doi Khun Tan National Parks in the Khun Tan Range, as well as Tham Pha Thai, Doi Luang National Park, and the Huai Tak Teak Biosphere Reserve in the Phi Pan Nam Range. The total forest area is or 70 percent of provincial area.

===National parks===
There are a total of eight national parks, six of which are in region 13 (Lampang branch), Doi Luang in region 15 (Chiang Mai), and Wiang Kosai in region 13 (Phrae) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Tham Pha Tai National Park, 
* Doi Luang National Park, 
* Mae Wa National Park, 
* Wiang Kosai national Park, 
* Doi Chong National Park,

* Doi Pha Muang Wildlife Sanctuary, 
* Tham Chao Ram Wildlife Sanctuary, 

==History==
Starting in the 7th century Lampang was part of the Dvaravati period Hariphunchai Kingdom of the Mon. But it was King Mengrai of Lanna who incorporated the complete Haripunchai Kingdom into his kingdom in 1292. Lampang or Nakhon Lampang or Lakhon, was under Burmese rule after the fall of Lanna Kingdom from the 16th century to 18th century. During the uprising against Burmese rule by Siam&#x27;s new kings in the late-18th century, a local Lampang leader became Siam&#x27;s ally. After the victory, the leader, Kawila, was named the ruler of Chiang Mai, the former center of Lanna, while his relative ruled Lampang. The city continues to be one of the important economic and political centers in the north. Lampang became a province of Thailand in 1892.

==Transport==
The city is an important highway hub, with a four lane highway link to Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai, as well as a major highway to Phrae and the eastern Lanna provinces. Lampang is roughly a 1.5 hour bus ride to Chiang Mai. Lampang is a stop for the Chiang Mai-bound train, approximately 10 hours from Bangkok.

Lampang Airport is served by Bangkok Airways (three flights daily to Suvarnabhumi Airport) and Nok air (four flights daily to Don Mueang) (Oct 2015).

== Health ==
The main hospital of Lampang is Lampang Hospital, operated by the Ministry of Public Health.

==Tourism==
Lampang province is not visited by many tourists, only about 900,000 per year, most of them passing through. In early 2019, the provincial governor rolled out a program called &quot;Lampang: Dream Destination&quot; to raise the number of visitors to two million within two years.

==Economy==

Lampang is known for the production of ceramic goods and its mining operations. A great deal of ball clay, china stone, and lignite are extracted from the surrounding mountains.
There are more than 200 ceramic factories in and around Mueang Lampang District. Most are small- to medium-sized operations producing novelties (plant pots, dolls), tableware, and building materials (tiles, railings).
The largest coal fired power plant in Southeast Asia is in Mae Mo District near the lignite mining area. The plant uses lignite as fuel. The largest concrete plant is also north of Mueang Lampang. This is also powered by lignite. Limestone is another abundant rock mined in Lampang. 
Agriculturally, the province produces rice and pineapples.

== Symbols ==
The provincial seal shows a white rooster inside the entrance to the Phra That Lampang Luang Temple. According to local legend, Buddha visited the province. The god Indra worried that the people would not wake up by themselves to show respect to Buddha, and therefore woke them by transforming himself into a white rooster.

The provincial flower is the Heliconia (&quot;Heliconia sp.&quot;), and the provincial tree is the Indian Elm (&quot;Holoptelea integrifolia&quot;). According to the legend, this tree was planted in the temple during Buddha&#x27;s visit. The provincial aquatic life is the horseface locah (&quot;Acantopsis dialuzona&quot;).

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into 13 districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). These are further divided into 100 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 855 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Lampang Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 42 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Lampang has city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) status. Khelang Nakhon, Lom Raet and Phichai have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 38 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 60 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).
==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<text>John Coyne (July 21, 1836 – November 16, 1873) was a Canadian barrister, and Peel County&#x27;s first representative in the Ontario Legislature.

A native of Toronto Township, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Coyne, he received his education in Brampton at Brampton Public School. He was educated as a lawyer, and called to the Bar of Upper Canada in 1864. Coyne also served as reeve of Brampton.

Entering provincial politics in 1867, as a Conservative, he beat out Liberal candidate Robert Smith by just 46 votes (1118 to 1072). The number 1118 had a strange, but merely coincidental, attraction to him, as proved by the next election in 1871. Posed against Chinguacousy&#x27;s T. O. Bowles, he won again with 1118 votes, against 1059 Liberal nods.

Coyne married Mary Catherine Scott, the youngest daughter of Brampton resident John Scott, in October 1867.

He died due to a short illness in 1873, after serving only two years of his second term.

<doc id="242849" wikidata="Q1509327" url="?curid=242849" title="Georgian Poetry">
<text>Georgian Poetry is a series of anthologies showcasing the work of a school of English poetry that established itself during the early years of the reign of King George V of the United Kingdom. 

The Georgian poets were, by the strictest definition, those whose works appeared in a series of five anthologies named &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot;, published by Harold Monro&#x27;s Poetry Bookshop in London and edited by Edward Marsh, the first volume of which contained poems written in 1911 and 1912. The group included Edmund Blunden, Rupert Brooke, Robert Graves, D. H. Lawrence, Walter de la Mare, Siegfried Sassoon, Ralph Hodgson, and John Drinkwater. Until the final two volumes, the decision had not been taken to include female poets.

==History==
The period of publication was sandwiched between the Victorian era, with its strict classicism, and Modernism, with its strident rejection of pure aestheticism. The common features of the poems in these publications were romanticism, sentimentality, and hedonism. Later critics have attempted to revise the definition of the term as a description of poetic style, thereby including some new names or excluding some old ones. W. H. Davies, a contemporary, is sometimes included within the grouping, although his &quot;innocent style&quot; differs markedly from that of the others.

In the 1930s, Henry Newbolt &quot;estimated there were still at least 1000 active poets&quot; in England, and that &quot;the vast majority would be recognisably &#x27;Georgian&#x27;&quot;.

Edward Marsh was the general editor of the series and the centre of the circle of Georgian poets, which included Rupert Brooke. It has been suggested that Brooke himself took a hand in some of the editorial choices.

The idea for an anthology began as a joke, when Marsh, Duncan Grant, and George Mallory decided, one evening in 1912, to publish a parody of the many small poetry books that were appearing at the time. After some discussion, they decided to pursue the idea in all seriousness. Marsh and Brooke approached poet and bookseller Harold Monro, who had recently opened The Poetry Bookshop at 35 Devonshire Street, in Bloomsbury, London. He agreed to publish the book in return for a half share of the profits.

After the third volume, Marsh decided that it was time to include a female poet. His choice was Fredegond Shove, although other associates suggested Edith Sitwell, Charlotte Mew, and Rose Macaulay. He included four poems from Shove&#x27;s recent first collection, &quot;Dreams and Journeys&quot; (1918), including among them &quot;The New Soul&quot;, a quasi-mystical approach to a religious subject that went on to attract the notice of critics. The final volume contained seven poems from the fifth collection of Vita Sackville-West, &quot;Orchard and Vineyard&quot; (1921).

Subsequent to the final anthology of five, further collections appeared, edited by J. C. Squire, which were probably intended to take on the mantle. The subsequent fate of the Georgian poets (inevitably known as the &quot;Squirearchy&quot;) then became an aspect of the critical debate surrounding modernist poetry, as marked by the publication of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; at just that time. The Georgian poets became something of a by-word for conservatism, but at the time of the early anthologies they saw themselves as modern (if not modernist) and progressive. The most important figures, in literary terms, would now be considered D. H. Lawrence and Robert Graves, neither of them &#x27;typical&#x27;.

<text>In finance, a futures contract (sometimes called futures) is a standardized legal contract to buy or sell something at a predetermined price for delivery at a specified time in the future, between parties not yet known to each other. The item transacted is usually a commodity or financial instrument. The predetermined price of the contract is known as the &quot;forward price&quot; or &quot;delivery price&quot;. The specified time in the future when delivery and payment occur is known as the &quot;delivery date&quot;. Because it derives its value from the value of the underlying asset, a futures contract is a derivative.

Contracts are traded at futures exchanges, which act as a marketplace between buyers and sellers. The buyer of a contract is said to be the long position holder and the selling party is said to be the short position holder. As both parties risk their counter-party reneging if the price goes against them, the contract may involve both parties lodging as security a margin of the value of the contract with a mutually trusted third party. For example, in gold futures trading, the margin varies between 2% and 20% depending on the volatility of the spot market.

A [[Stock market index future|stock future]] is a cash-settled futures contract on the value of a particular stock market index. Stock futures are one of the high risk trading instruments in the market. Stock market index futures are also used as indicators to determine market sentiment.

The first futures contracts were negotiated for agricultural commodities, and later futures contracts were negotiated for natural resources such as oil. Financial futures were introduced in 1972, and in recent decades, currency futures, interest rate futures, stock market index futures, and cryptocurrency inverse futures and perpetual futures have played an increasingly large role in the overall futures markets. Even organ futures have been proposed to increase the supply of transplant organs.

The original use of futures contracts mitigates the risk of price or exchange rate movements by allowing parties to fix prices or rates in advance for future transactions. This could be advantageous when (for example) a party expects to receive payment in foreign currency in the future and wishes to guard against an unfavorable movement of the currency in the interval before payment is received.

However, futures contracts also offer opportunities for speculation in that a trader who predicts that the price of an asset will move in a particular direction can contract to buy or sell it in the future at a price which (if the prediction is correct) will yield a profit. In particular, if the speculator is able to profit, then the underlying commodity that the speculator traded would have been saved during a time of surplus and sold during a time of need, offering the consumers of the commodity a more favorable distribution of commodity over time.

==Origin==
The Dōjima Rice Exchange, first established in 1697 in Osaka, is considered by some to be the first futures exchange market, to meet the needs of samurai who—being paid in rice—needed a stable conversion to coin after a series of bad harvests.

The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) listed the first-ever standardized &#x27;exchange traded&#x27; forward contracts in 1864, which were called futures contracts. This contract was based on grain trading, and started a trend that saw contracts created on a number of different standardized futures contracts based on commodities, as well as a number of futures exchanges set up in countries around the world. By 1875 cotton futures were being traded in Bombay in India and within a few years this had expanded to futures on edible oilseeds complex, raw jute and jute goods and bullion. In the 1930s two thirds of all futures was in wheat.

The 1972 creation of the International Monetary Market (IMM) by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was the world&#x27;s first financial futures exchange, and launched currency futures. In 1976, the IMM added interest rate futures on US treasury bills, and in 1982 they added stock market index futures.

==Risk mitigation==
Although futures contracts are oriented towards a future time point, their main purpose is to mitigate the risk of default by either party in the intervening period. In this vein, the futures exchange requires both parties to put up initial cash, or a performance bond, known as the margin. Margins, sometimes set as a percentage of the value of the futures contract, must be maintained throughout the life of the contract to guarantee the agreement, as over this time the price of the contract can vary as a function of supply and demand, causing one side of the exchange to lose money at the expense of the other.

To mitigate the risk of default, the product is marked to market on a daily basis where the difference between the initial agreed-upon price and the actual daily futures price is re-evaluated daily. This is sometimes known as the variation margin, where the futures exchange will draw money out of the losing party&#x27;s margin account and put it into that of the other party, ensuring the correct loss or profit is reflected daily. If the margin account goes below a certain value set by the exchange, then a margin call is made and the account owner must replenish the margin account.

On the delivery date, the amount exchanged is not the specified price on the contract but the spot value, since any gain or loss has already been previously settled by marking to market.

==Margin==


To minimize counterparty risk to traders, trades executed on regulated futures exchanges are guaranteed by a clearing house. The clearing house becomes the buyer to each seller, and the seller to each buyer, so that in the event of a counterparty default the clearer assumes the risk of loss. This enables traders to transact without performing due diligence on their counterparty.

Margin requirements are waived or reduced in some cases for hedgers who have physical ownership of the covered commodity or spread traders who have offsetting contracts balancing the position.

Clearing margin are financial safeguards to ensure that companies or corporations perform on their customers&#x27; open futures and options contracts. Clearing margins are distinct from customer margins that individual buyers and sellers of futures and options contracts are required to deposit with brokers.

Customer margin Within the futures industry, financial guarantees required of both buyers and sellers of futures contracts and sellers of options contracts to ensure fulfillment of contract obligations. Futures Commission Merchants are responsible for overseeing customer margin accounts. Margins are determined on the basis of market risk and contract value. Also referred to as performance bond margin.

Initial margin is the equity required to initiate a futures position. This is a type of performance bond. The maximum exposure is not limited to the amount of the initial margin, however, the initial margin requirement is calculated based on the maximum estimated change in contract value within a trading day. The initial margin is set by the exchange.

If a position involves an exchange-traded product, the amount or percentage of the initial margin is set by the exchange concerned.

In case of loss or if the value of the initial margin is being eroded, the broker will make a margin call in order to restore the amount of initial margin available. Often referred to as &quot;variation margin&quot;, margin called, for this reason, is usually done on a daily basis, however, in times of high volatility, a broker can make a margin call intra-day.

Margin calls are usually expected to be paid and received on the same day. If not, the broker has the right to close sufficient positions to meet the amount called by way of margin. After the position is closed out the client is liable for any resulting deficit in the client&#x27;s account.

Some U.S. exchanges also use the term &quot;maintenance margin&quot;, which in effect defines how much the value of the initial margin can reduce before a margin call is made. However, most non-US brokers only use the term &quot;initial margin&quot; and &quot;variation margin&quot;.

The Initial Margin requirement is established by the Futures exchange, in contrast to other securities&#x27; Initial Margin (which is set by the Federal Reserve in the U.S. Markets).

A futures account is marked to market daily. If the margin drops below the margin maintenance requirement established by the exchange listing the futures, a margin call will be issued to bring the account back up to the required level.

Maintenance margin A set minimum margin per outstanding futures contract that a customer must maintain in their margin account.

Margin-equity ratio is a term used by speculators, representing the amount of their trading capital that is being held as margin at any particular time. The low margin requirements of futures results in substantial leverage of the investment. However, the exchanges require a minimum amount that varies depending on the contract and the trader. The broker may set the requirement higher, but may not set it lower. A trader, of course, can set it above that, if he does not want to be subject to margin calls.

Performance bond margin The amount of money deposited by both a buyer and seller of a futures contract or an options seller to ensure the performance of the term of the contract. Margin in commodities is not a payment of equity or down payment on the commodity itself, but rather it is a security deposit.

Return on margin (ROM) is often used to judge performance because it represents the gain or loss compared to the exchange&#x27;s perceived risk as reflected in the required margin. ROM may be calculated (realized return) / (initial margin). The Annualized ROM is equal to (ROM+1)(year/trade_duration)-1. For example, if a trader earns 10% on margin in two months, that would be about 77% annualized.

==Settlement − physical versus cash-settled futures==
Settlement is the act of the contract, and can be done in one of two ways, as specified per type of futures contract:
* Physical delivery − the amount specified of the underlying asset of the contract is delivered by the seller of the contract to the exchange, and by the exchange to the buyers of the contract. Physical delivery is common with commodities and bonds. In practice, it occurs only on a minority of contracts. Most are canceled out by purchasing a covering position—that is, buying a contract to cancel out an earlier sale (covering a short), or selling a contract to liquidate an earlier purchase (covering a long). The majority of energy contracts on the NYMEX use this method of settlement upon expiration. The vast majority of contracts do not end up settling for physical delivery; holders will either close out the position by reversing their exposure, or, for some physical traders, settle via an EFP (Exchange For Physical) arrangement with a counterparty holding the opposite position. Some Treasuries contracts on the CBOT also settle via physical delivery. 
* Cash settlement − a cash payment is made based on the underlying reference rate, such as a short-term interest rate index such as 90 Day T-Bills, or the closing value of a stock market index. The parties settle by paying/receiving the loss/gain related to the contract in cash when the contract expires. Cash settled futures are those that, as a practical matter, could not be settled by delivery of the referenced item—for example, it would be impossible to deliver an index. A futures contract might also opt to settle against an index based on trade in a related spot market. ICE Brent futures use this method of settlement.
Expiry (or Expiration in the U.S.) is the time and the day that a particular delivery month of a futures contract stops trading, as well as the final settlement price for that contract. For many equity index futures and interest rate futures as well as for most equity (index) options, this happens on the third Friday of certain trading months. On this day the &quot;back month&quot; futures contract becomes the &quot;front-month&quot; futures contract. For example, for most CME and CBOT contracts, at the expiration of the December contract, the March futures become the nearest contract. During a short period (perhaps 30 minutes) the underlying cash price and the futures prices sometimes struggle to converge. At this moment the futures and the underlying assets are extremely liquid and any disparity between an index and an underlying asset is quickly traded by arbitrageurs. At this moment also, the increase in volume is caused by traders rolling over positions to the next contract or, in the case of equity index futures, purchasing underlying components of those indexes to hedge against current index positions. On the expiry date, a European equity arbitrage trading desk in London or Frankfurt will see positions expire in as many as eight major markets almost every half an hour. Exchanges implement strict limits on how much exposure an entity may have closer to expiration as an effort to avoid any volatility around final settlement.

==Pricing==
When the deliverable asset exists in plentiful supply or may be freely created, then the price of a futures contract is determined via arbitrage arguments. This is typical for stock index futures, treasury bond futures, and futures on physical commodities when they are in supply (e.g. agricultural crops after the harvest). However, when the deliverable commodity is not in plentiful supply or when it does not yet exist—for example on crops before the harvest or on Eurodollar Futures or Federal funds rate futures (in which the supposed underlying instrument is to be created upon the delivery date)—the futures price cannot be fixed by arbitrage. In this scenario, there is only one force setting the price, which is simple supply and demand for the asset in the future, as expressed by supply and demand for the futures contract.

===Arbitrage arguments===
Arbitrage arguments (&quot;rational pricing&quot;) apply when the deliverable asset exists in plentiful supply or may be freely created. Here, the forward price represents the expected future value of the underlying discounted at the risk-free rate—as any deviation from the theoretical price will afford investors a riskless profit opportunity and should be arbitraged away. We define the forward price to be the strike K such that the contract has 0 value at the present time. Assuming interest rates are constant the forward price of the futures is equal to the forward price of the forward contract with the same strike and maturity. It is also the same if the underlying asset is uncorrelated with interest rates. Otherwise, the difference between the forward price on the futures (futures price) and the forward price on the asset, is proportional to the covariance between the underlying asset price and interest rates. For example, a futures contract on a zero-coupon bond will have a futures price lower than the forward price. This is called the futures &quot;convexity correction&quot;.

Thus, assuming constant rates, for a simple, non-dividend paying asset, the value of the futures/forward price, &quot;F(t,T)&quot;, will be found by compounding the present value &quot;S(t)&quot; at time &quot;t&quot; to maturity &quot;T&quot; by the rate of risk-free return &quot;r&quot;.

:formula_1

or, with &quot;continuous compounding&quot;

:formula_2

This relationship may be modified for storage costs &quot;u&quot;, dividend or income yields &quot;q&quot;, and convenience yields &quot;y&quot;. Storage costs are costs involved in storing a commodity to sell at the futures price. Investors selling the asset at the spot price to arbitrage a futures price earns the storage costs they would have paid to store the asset to sell at the futures price. Convenience yields are benefits of holding an asset for sale at the futures price beyond the cash received from the sale. Such benefits could include the ability to meet unexpected demand, or the ability to use the asset as an input in production. Investors pay or give up the convenience yield when selling at the spot price because they give up these benefits. Such a relationship can be summarized as:

:formula_3

The convenience yield is not easily observable or measured, so &quot;y&quot; is often calculated, when &quot;r&quot; and &quot;u&quot; are known, as the extraneous yield paid by investors selling at spot to arbitrage the futures price. Dividend or income yields &quot;q&quot; are more easily observed or estimated, and can be incorporated in the same way:

:formula_4

In a perfect market, the relationship between futures and spot prices depends only on the above variables; in practice, there are various market imperfections (transaction costs, differential borrowing, and lending rates, restrictions on short selling) that prevent complete arbitrage. Thus, the futures price in fact varies within arbitrage boundaries around the theoretical price.

===Pricing via expectation===
When the deliverable commodity is not in plentiful supply (or when it does not yet exist) rational pricing cannot be applied, as the arbitrage mechanism is not applicable. Here the price of the futures is determined by today&#x27;s supply and demand for the underlying asset in the future.

In an efficient market, supply and demand would be expected to balance out at a futures price that represents the present value of an unbiased expectation of the price of the asset at the delivery date. This relationship can be represented as::

:formula_5

By contrast, in a shallow and illiquid market, or in a market in which large quantities of the deliverable asset have been deliberately withheld from market participants (an illegal action known as cornering the market), the market clearing price for the futures may still represent the balance between supply and demand but the relationship between this price and the expected future price of the asset can break down.

===Relationship between arbitrage arguments and expectation===
The expectation-based relationship will also hold in a no-arbitrage setting when we take expectations with respect to the risk-neutral probability. In other words: a futures price is a martingale with respect to the risk-neutral probability. With this pricing rule, a speculator is expected to break even when the futures market fairly prices the deliverable commodity.

===Contango, backwardation, normal and inverted markets===
The situation where the price of a commodity for future delivery is higher than the expected spot price is known as contango. Markets are said to be normal when futures prices are above the current spot price and far-dated futures are priced above near-dated futures. The reverse, where the price of a commodity for future delivery is lower than the expected spot price is known as backwardation. Similarly, markets are said to be inverted when futures prices are below the current spot price and far-dated futures are priced below near-dated futures.

==Futures contracts and exchanges==

===Contract===

There are many different kinds of futures contracts, reflecting the many different kinds of &quot;tradable&quot; assets about which the contract may be based such as commodities, securities (such as single-stock futures), currencies or intangibles such as interest rates and indexes. For information on futures markets in specific underlying commodity markets, follow the links. For a list of tradable commodities futures contracts, see List of traded commodities.

Trading on commodities began in Japan in the 18th century with the trading of rice and silk, and similarly in Holland with tulip bulbs. Trading in the US began in the mid 19th century when central grain markets were established and a marketplace was created for farmers to bring their commodities and sell them either for immediate delivery (also called spot or cash market) or for forward delivery. These forward contracts were private contracts between buyers and sellers and became the forerunner to today&#x27;s exchange-traded futures contracts. Although contract trading began with traditional commodities such as grains, meat, and livestock, exchange trading has expanded to include metals, energy, currency and currency indexes, equities and equity indexes, government interest rates, and private interest rates.

===Exchanges===

Contracts on financial instruments were introduced in the 1970s by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and these instruments became hugely successful and quickly overtook commodities futures in terms of trading volume and global accessibility to the markets. This innovation led to the introduction of many new futures exchanges worldwide, such as the London International Financial Futures Exchange in 1982 (now Euronext. liffe), Deutsche Terminbörse (now Eurex) and the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM). Today, there are more than 90 futures and futures options exchanges worldwide trading to include:
* CME Group (CBOT and CME) – Currencies, Various Interest Rate derivatives (including US Bonds); Agriculture (Corn, Soybeans, Soy Products, Wheat, Pork, Cattle, Butter, Milk); Indices (Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ Composite, S&amp;P 500, etc.); Metals (Gold, Silver). NYMEX (CME Group) – energy and metals: crude oil, gasoline, heating oil, natural gas, coal, propane, gold, silver, platinum, copper, aluminum and palladium.
* Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME) – most notably Oman Crude, Dubai Platts, and Singapore Fuel Oil.
* Intercontinental Exchange (ICE Futures Europe) – formerly the International Petroleum Exchange trades energy including crude oil, heating oil, gas oil (diesel), refined petroleum products, electric power, coal, natural gas, and emissions
* NYSE Euronext – which absorbed Euronext into which London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange or LIFFE (pronounced &#x27;LIFE&#x27;) was merged.

===Codes===
Most futures contract codes are five characters. The first two characters identify the contract type, the third character identifies the month and the last two characters identify the year.

On CME Group markets, third (month) futures contract codes are: Contracts expire after the listing month. Therefore traders must roll over their positions into the next month code.
* January = F
* February = G
* March = H
* April = J
* May = K
* June = M
* July = N
* August = Q
* September = U
* October = V
* November = X
* December = Z
Example: CLX14 is a Crude Oil (CL), November (X) 2014 (14) contract.

==Futures contracts users==
Futures traders are traditionally placed in one of two groups: hedgers and speculators. Hedgers have an interest in the underlying asset (which could include an intangible such as an index or interest rate) and are seeking to &quot;hedge out&quot; the risk of price changes. Speculators, by contrast, seek to make a profit by predicting market moves and opening a derivative contract related to the asset &quot;on paper&quot;, while they have no practical use for or intent to actually take or make delivery of the underlying asset. In other words, speculators are seeking exposure to the asset in long futures contracts or the opposite effect via short futures contracts.

===Hedgers===
Hedgers typically include producers and consumers of a commodity or the owner of an asset or assets subject to certain influences such as an interest rate.

For example, in traditional commodity markets, farmers often sell futures contracts for the crops and livestock they produce to guarantee a certain price, making it easier for them to plan. Similarly, livestock producers often purchase futures to cover their feed costs, so that they can plan on a fixed cost for feed. In modern (financial) markets, &quot;producers&quot; of interest rate swaps or equity derivative products will use financial futures or equity index futures to reduce or remove the risk on the swap.

Those that buy or sell commodity futures need to be careful. If a company buys contracts hedging against price increases, but in fact, the market price of the commodity is substantially lower at the time of delivery, they could find themselves disastrously non-competitive (for example see: VeraSun Energy).

Investment fund managers at the portfolio and the fund sponsor level can use financial asset futures to manage portfolio interest rate risk, or duration, without making cash purchases or sales using bond futures. Invest firms that receive capital calls or capital inflows in a different currency than their base currency could use currency futures to hedge the currency risk of that inflow in the future.

===Speculators===
Speculators typically fall into three categories: position traders, day traders, and swing traders (swing trading), though many hybrid types and unique styles exist. With many investors pouring into the futures markets in recent years controversy has risen about whether speculators are responsible for increased volatility in commodities like oil, and experts are divided on the matter.

An example that has both hedge and speculative notions involves a mutual fund or separately managed account whose investment objective is to track the performance of a stock index such as the S&amp;P 500 stock index. The portfolio manager often &quot;equitizes&quot; unintended cash holdings or cash inflows in an easy and cost-effective manner by investing in (opening long) S&amp;P 500 stock index futures. This gains the portfolio exposure to the index which is consistent with the fund or account investment objective without having to buy an appropriate proportion of each of the individual 500 stocks just yet. This also preserves balanced diversification, maintains a higher degree of the percent of assets invested in the market and helps reduce tracking error in the performance of the fund/account. When it is economically feasible (an efficient amount of shares of every individual position within the fund or account can be purchased), the portfolio manager can close the contract and make purchases of each individual stock.

The social utility of futures markets is considered to be mainly in the transfer of risk, and increased liquidity between traders with different risk and time preferences, from a hedger to a speculator, for example.

==Options on futures==

In many cases, &quot;options&quot; are traded on futures, sometimes called simply &quot;futures options&quot;. A put is the option to sell a futures contract, and a call is the option to buy a futures contract. For both, the option strike price is the specified futures price at which the futures is traded if the option is exercised. Futures are often used since they are delta one instruments. Calls and options on futures may be priced similarly to those on traded assets by using an extension of the Black-Scholes formula, namely the Black model. For options on futures, where the premium is not due until unwound, the positions are commonly referred to as a fution, as they act like options, however, they settle like futures.

Investors can either take on the role of option seller (or &quot;writer&quot;) or the option buyer. Option sellers are generally seen as taking on more risk because they are contractually obligated to take the opposite futures position if the buyer of the option exercises their right to the futures position specified in the option. The price of an option is determined by supply and demand principles and consists of the option premium, or the price paid to the option seller for offering the option and taking on risk.

Where as futures often matures on a quarterly or monthly basis, their options expires more frequent (i.e. daily). Examples are options on futures with the underlying in gold (XAU), index (Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500) or commodities (oil, VIX). The stock exchanges and their clearing houses provide overviews of these products (CME, COMEX, NYMEX).

==Futures contract regulations==
All futures transactions in the United States are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), an independent agency of the United States government. The commission has the right to impose fines and other punishments on individuals or companies that break rules. Although by law the commission regulates all transactions, each exchange can have its own rule, and under contract can fine companies for different things or extend the fine that the CFTC hands out.

The CFTC publishes weekly reports containing details of the open interest of market participants for each market segment that has more than 20 participants. These reports are released every Friday (including data from the previous Tuesday) and contain data on open interest split by reportable and non-reportable open interest as well as commercial and non-commercial open interest. This type of report is referred to as the &#x27;Commitments of Traders Report&#x27;, COT-Report, or simply COTR.

==Definition of a futures contract==
The following definition from Björk describes a futures contract with delivery of item J at time T:
* There exists in the market a quoted price &quot;F(t,T)&quot;, which is known as the futures price at time t for delivery of J at time T.
* The price of entering a futures contract is equal to zero.
* During any time interval formula_6, the holder receives the amount formula_7. (this reflects instantaneous marking to market)
* At time &quot;T&quot;, the holder pays &quot;F(T,T)&quot; and is entitled to receive J. Note that &quot;F(T,T)&quot; should be the spot price of J at time T.

==Futures versus forwards==
A closely related contract is a forward contract. A forward is like a futures in that it specifies the exchange of goods for a specified price at a specified future date. However, a forward is not traded on an exchange and thus does not have the interim partial payments due to marking to market.

While futures and forward contracts are both contracts to deliver an asset on a future date at a prearranged price, they are different in two main respects:
* Futures are exchange-traded, while forwards are traded over-the-counter.
*: Thus futures are standardized and face an exchange, while forwards are customized and face a non-exchange counterparty.
* Futures are margined, while forwards are not.
*: Thus futures have significantly less credit risk, and have different funding.
Forwards have credit risk, but futures do not because a clearing house guarantees against default risk by taking both sides of the trade and marking to market their positions every night.
Forwards are basically unregulated, while futures contracts are regulated at the central government level.

The Futures Industry Association (FIA) estimates that 6.97 billion futures contracts were traded in 2007, an increase of nearly 32% over the 2006 figure.

===Exchange versus OTC===
Futures are always traded on an exchange, whereas forwards always trade over-the-counter, or can simply be a signed contract between two parties. Therefore:
* Futures are highly standardized, being exchange-traded, whereas forwards can be unique, being over-the-counter.
* In the case of physical delivery, the forward contract specifies to whom to make the delivery. The counterparty for delivery on a futures contract is chosen by the clearing house.

===Exchange for Related Position===
A variety of trades have developed that involve an exchange of a futures contract for either a over-the-counter, physical commodity, or cash asset position that meets certain criteria such as scale and correspondence to the underlying commodity risk.

===Margining===
Futures are margined daily to the daily spot price of a forward with the same agreed-upon delivery price and the underlying asset (based on &quot;mark to market&quot;).

Forwards do not have a standard. More typical would be for the parties to agree to true up, for example, every quarter. The fact that forwards are not margined daily means that, due to movements in the price of the underlying asset, a large differential can build up between the forward&#x27;s delivery price and the settlement price, and in any event, an unrealized gain (loss) can build up.

Again, this differs from futures which get &#x27;trued-up&#x27; typically daily by a comparison of the market value of the futures to the collateral securing the contract to keep it in line with the brokerage margin requirements. This true-ing up occurs by the &quot;loss&quot; party providing additional collateral; so if the buyer of the contract incurs a drop in value, the shortfall or variation margin would typically be shored up by the investor wiring or depositing additional cash in the brokerage account.

In a forward though, the spread in exchange rates is not trued up regularly but, rather, it builds up as unrealized gain (loss) depending on which side of the trade being discussed. This means that entire unrealized gain (loss) becomes realized at the time of delivery (or as what typically occurs, the time the contract is closed prior to expiration)—assuming the parties must transact at the underlying currency&#x27;s spot price to facilitate receipt/delivery.

The result is that forwards have higher credit risk than futures, and that funding is charged differently.

The situation for forwards, however, where no daily true-up takes place, in turn, creates credit risk for forwards, but not so much for futures. Simply put, the risk of a forward contract is that the supplier will be unable to deliver the referenced asset, or that the buyer will be unable to pay for it on the delivery date or the date at which the opening party closes the contract.

The margining of futures eliminates much of this credit risk by forcing the holders to update daily to the price of an equivalent forward purchased that day. This means that there will usually be very little additional money due on the final day to settle the futures contract: only the final day&#x27;s gain or loss, not the gain or loss over the life of the contract.

In addition, the daily futures-settlement failure risk is borne by an exchange, rather than an individual party, further limiting credit risk in futures.

Example:
Consider a futures contract with a $100 price: Let&#x27;s say that on day 50, a futures contract with a $100 delivery price (on the same underlying asset as the future) costs $88. On day 51, that futures contract costs $90. This means that the &quot;mark-to-market&quot; calculation would require the holder of one side of the futures to pay $2 on day 51 to track the changes of the forward price (&quot;post $2 of margin&quot;). This money goes, via margin accounts, to the holder of the other side of the future. That is the loss party wires cash to the other party.

A forward-holder, however, may pay nothing until settlement on the final day, potentially building up a large balance; this may be reflected in the mark by an allowance for credit risk. So, except for tiny effects of convexity bias (due to earning or paying interest on margin), futures and forwards with equal delivery prices result in the same total loss or gain, but holders of futures experience that loss/gain in daily increments which track the forward&#x27;s daily price changes, while the forward&#x27;s spot price converges to the settlement price. Thus, while under mark to market accounting, for both assets the gain or loss accrues over the holding period; for a futures this gain or loss is realized daily, while for a forward contract the gain or loss remains unrealized until expiry.

With an exchange-traded future, the clearing-house interposes itself on every trade. Thus there is no risk of counterparty default. The only risk is that the clearing house defaults (e.g. become bankrupt), which is considered very unlikely.

<text>Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi, also known as Jean Charles Leonard Simonde de Sismondi (; 9 May 1773 – 25 June 1842), whose real surname was Simonde, was a Swiss historian and political economist, who is best known for his works on French and Italian history, and his economic ideas. His &quot;Nouveaux principes d&#x27;économie politique, ou de la richesse dans ses rapports avec la population&quot; (1819) represents the first liberal critique of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics. He was one of the pioneering advocates of unemployment insurance, sickness benefits, a progressive tax, regulation of working hours, and a pension scheme. He was also the first to coin the term &quot;proletariat&quot; to refer to the working class created under capitalism, and his discussion of &quot;mieux value&quot; anticipates the concept of surplus value. According to Gareth Stedman Jones, &quot;much of what Sismondi wrote became part of the standard repertoire of socialist criticism of modern industry,&quot; earning him critical commentary in the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot;.

==Early life==
His paternal family seem to have borne the name Simonde, at least from the time when they migrated from Dauphiné to Geneva at the revocation of the edict of Nantes. It was not till after Sismondi had become an author that, observing the identity of his family arms with those of the once flourishing Pisan house of the Sismondi and finding that some members of that house had migrated to France, he assumed the connection without further proof and called himself Sismondi.

The Simondes, however, were themselves citizens of Geneva of the upper class, and possessed both rank and property, though the father was also a village pastor. His uncle by marriage was the prominent pastor Jacob Vernes, a friend of Voltaire and Rousseau.

The future historian was well educated, but his family wished him to devote himself to commerce rather than literature, and he became a banker&#x27;s clerk in Lyon. Then the Revolution broke out, and as it affected Geneva, the Simonde family took refuge in England where they stayed for eighteen months (1793–1794). Disliking—it is said—the climate, they returned to Geneva, but found the state of affairs still unfavourable; there is even a legend that the head of the family was reduced to selling milk himself in the town. The greater part of the family property was sold, and with the proceeds they emigrated to Italy, bought a small farm in Pescia near Lucca and Pistoia, and set to work to cultivate it themselves.

Sismondi worked hard there, with both his hands and mind, and his experiences gave him the material of his first book, &quot;Tableau de l&#x27;agriculture toscane&quot;, which, after returning to Geneva, he published there in 1801. At a young age, Sismondi had read &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; and became strongly attached to Smith&#x27;s theories. He apparently published his first work on the subject of political economy, &quot;De la richesse commerciale ou principes de l&#x27;economie politique appliqué à la legislation du commerce&quot; (1803) to explain and popularize Smith&#x27;s doctrine, but following this Sismondi spent a considerable amount of time dedicated to historical research. He again turned his attention to political economy around 1818 when he was commissioned to write an entry on &quot;Political Economy&quot; for the &quot;Edinburgh Encyclopædia&quot;. This was just following a serious economic downturn after the outbreak of the first major crisis in 1815.

==Criticism of economic orthodoxy==
As an economist, Sismondi represented a humanitarian protest against the dominant orthodoxy of his time. In his 1803 book, he followed Adam Smith; but in his principal subsequent economic work, &quot;Nouveaux principes d&#x27;économie politique&quot; (1819), he insisted on the fact that economic science studied the means of increasing wealth too much, and the use of wealth for producing happiness, too little. For the science of economics, his most important contribution was probably his discovery of economic cycles. In contrast to other thinkers at the time (notably J. B. Say and David Ricardo), Sismondi challenged the idea that economic equilibrium leading to full employment would be spontaneously achieved. He wrote, &quot;Let us beware of this dangerous theory of equilibrium which is supposed to be automatically established. A certain kind of equilibrium, it is true, is reestablished in the long run, but it is after a frightful amount of suffering.&quot; Sismondi also argued that classical economics failed to consider the negative social and environmental impacts of economic growth, and that it failed to address issues of income inequality and social justice. Although his thinking is characterized as &quot;petty-bourgeois Socialism&quot; in the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot;, Sismondi was not a socialist. Nonetheless, in protesting against laissez faire and invoking the state &quot;to regulate the progress of wealth,&quot; he was an interesting precursor of the German Historical school of economics.

Focuses of his work are central to the idea of taking particular economic situations and analyzing them in the situational setting of history from which one is drawing data or insight.

Sismondi is known for the study of economic crises rooting from “the social ramifications of the economic system rather than on its structure.” His interpretations put him before Marx, in semi-defining the bourgeoisie and proletariat division in society. Key to his philosophy, Sismondi saw these class divisions to coincide with crises in the economy and didn&#x27;t see extreme social reform as the answer, but rather moderate versions that allowed for technological advances to be slowed for the economy to catch up, via limiting production and the limitation of what he referred to as “the prevailing glorification of free competition”, all while, most importantly, allowing individuals to retain private property and any revenues generated from it.

His theory may more precisely be classed as one of periodic &quot;crises,&quot; rather than &quot;cycles&quot; per se. and as such is the earliest theorist of systemic crisis theory. His theory was adapted by Charles Dunoyer, who introduces the notion of cycling between two phases, thus giving a modern form of economic cycle.

As important was his role as an economist; Sismondi was renowned as a historian. He commonly applied economic thought and historical settings to explain the irrationality of past economic events.

Sismondi also contributed a great deal to economics with his thoughts on aggregate demand. Observing the capitalist industrial system in England, Sismondi saw that unchecked competition both resulted in producers all increasing individual production (because of lack of knowledge of other producers&#x27; production) this was then seen as forcing employers to cut prices, which they did by sacrificing workers&#x27; wages. This yielded overproduction &quot;and&quot; underconsumption; with most of England&#x27;s workforce suffering from depressed wages, workers were then unable to afford the goods they had produced, and underconsumption of goods then followed. Sismondi believed that by increasing the wages of laborers they would have more buying power, be able to buy the national output and thus increase demand.

In his book &quot;On Classical Economics&quot;, Thomas Sowell devotes a chapter to Sismondi, arguing that he was a neglected pioneer.

==Italian history==
Meanwhile, he began to compile his great &quot;Histoire des républiques italiennes du Moyen Âge&quot;, and was introduced to Madame de Staël. He became part of her Coppet group, he was invited or commanded—for Madame de Stael was of chief political importance—to form one of the suite with which the future Corinne made the journey to Italy, which contributed to &quot;Corinne&quot; itself during the years 1804–1805. Sismondi was not altogether at ease here, and he particularly disliked Schlegel who was also a participant. But during this journey he met the Countess of Albany, widow of Charles Edward, who all her life was gifted with a singular ability to attract the affection of men of letters. Sismondi&#x27;s platonic relationship with her was close and lasted long, and they produced much valuable and interesting correspondence.

In 1807 appeared the first volumes of the above-mentioned book about the Italian republics, which, though his essay in political economy had brought him some reputation and the offer of a Russian professorship, first made Sismondi a prominent man among European men of letters. The completion of this book, which extended to sixteen volumes, occupied him, though by no means entirely, for the next eleven years. He lived at first in Geneva where he delivered some interesting lectures about the literature of southern Europe, which were continued from time to time and finally published. He held an official position: secretary of the chamber of commerce for the then-department of Léman.

==French history==
Sismondi lived in Paris from 1813 until the Restoration, supporting Napoleon Bonaparte and meeting him once. Upon completing his book on Italian history, in 1818 he began his &quot;Histoire des Français&quot;, published in 29 volumes over 23 years. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, &quot;His untiring industry enabled him to compile many other books, but it is on these two that his fame mainly rests. The former displays his qualities in the most favourable light, and has been least injuriously affected by subsequent writings and investigations. But the latter, as a careful and accurate sketch on a grand scale, has now been superseded. Sainte-Beuve has, with benevolent sarcasm, surnamed the author &quot;the Rollin of French History,&quot; and the praise and the blame implied in the comparison are both perfectly well deserved&quot;.

== Later life ==

In April 1819 Sismondi married a Welshwoman, Jessie Allen (1777–1853), whose sister, Catherine Allen, was the wife of Sir James Mackintosh and another sister, Elizabeth Allen, was the wife of Josiah Wedgwood II and mother of Emma Wedgwood. This marriage appears to have been a very happy one.

In 1826 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

After spending the last years of his life in Geneva preparing new editions of his writings, finishing his study of the French, and serving as a member of the Geneva Assembly, speaking for freedom with order, he died in 1842 of stomach cancer.

==Other works==

Besides the works mentioned above Sismondi produced many others, never working less than eight hours a day for many years. The most important ones are: &quot;Littérature du midi de l&#x27;Europe&quot; [Literature of Southern Europe] (1813), a historical novel entitled &quot;Julia Severa ou l&#x27;an 492&quot; (1822), &quot;Histoire de la renaissance de la liberté en Italie&quot; (1832), &quot;Histoire de la chute de l&#x27;Empire romain&quot; (1835), &quot;Précis de l&#x27;histoire des Français&quot;, an abridgment of his own book (1839), and several others, mainly political pamphlets.

Sismondi&#x27;s journals and his correspondence with Channing, with the countess of Albany and with others have been published mainly by Mlle Mongolfier (Paris, 1843) and M. de Saint-René Taillandier (Paris, 1863). The latter work serves as the main text of two admirable &quot;Lundis&quot; of Sainte-Beuve (September 1863), republished in the &quot;Nouveaux Lundis&quot;, vol. VI.

==Historiographical position and political stance==
He was a historian whose economic ideas passed through different phases. The acceptance of free trade principles in &quot;De la richesse commerciale&quot; was abandoned in favour of a critical posture towards free trade and industrialisation. &quot;Nouveaux principes d&#x27;économie politique&quot; attacked wealth accumulation both as an end in itself, and for its detrimental effect on the poor. He indicated contradictions of capitalism. He criticized the harsh conditions endured by the workers from the standpoint of a liberal republican. He was also a passionate opponent of slavery. Adolphe Blanqui said of him: &quot;No writer has shown a sympathy more notable and more touching for the working classes.&quot; Jean-Baptiste Say referred to Sismondi as &quot;that enlightened author, ingenious, eloquent and selfless.&quot;

His critique was noticed by Malthus, David Ricardo and J. S. Mill, who called his writing &quot;sprightly, and frequently eloquent.&quot; While a young man at Edinburgh, Thomas Carlyle translated Sismondi&#x27;s article on &quot;Political Economy&quot; for David Brewster&#x27;s &quot;Edinburgh Encyclopædia&quot;. Sismondi subsequently influenced Carlyle&#x27;s conception of the Dismal Science. Sismondi&#x27;s Italian histories were read and esteemed by Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Stendhal.

Sismondi influenced many major socialist thinkers including Karl Marx, Rosa Luxemburg, and Robert Owen. Marx thought Sismondi embodied the critique of the &quot;bourgeois science of economics.&quot; In his notes, Marx excerpted various aspects of his analysis. Marx was particularly fond of Sismondi&#x27;s statement that &quot;The Roman proletariat lived almost exclusively at the expense of society. One could almost say that modern society lives at the expense of the proletariat, from the share which it deducts from the reward of his labor.&quot; Henryk Grossman argued that Sismondi was a significant methodological and theoretical predecessor of Marx, particularly by identifying the contradiction between use-value and exchange-value as fundamental to capitalism. In 1897, Vladimir Lenin wrote an article refuting Sismondi&#x27;s work. Lenin said,

The contributor to Russkoye Bogatstvo states at the very outset that no writer has been &quot;so wrongly appraised&quot; as Sismondi, who, he alleges, has been &quot;unjustly&quot; represented, now as a reactionary, then as a utopian. The very opposite is true. Precisely this appraisal of Sismondi is quite correct.

In 1913, Rosa Luxemburg wrote a critique of Sismondi in &quot;The Accumulation of Capital&quot;.

The historian Jerzy Jedlicki writes:

All sorts of labels were pinned on this humanist from Geneva who lived in the period of the beginnings of industrial capitalism: he was regarded as a reactionary and a radical, a petty-bourgeois socialist and a romanticist. But when we read his work a hundred and fifty years later, we discover in him a precursor of the democratized, corrective liberalism of the twentieth century and also, in spite of all the defects of his economic theory, a precursor of concepts for the development of overpopulated countries with a low national income. Sismondi’s thought, unfettered by doctrine, has stood the test of time, something which cannot be said of many of his contemporaries.

<text>Kai Chresten Winding ( ; May 18, 1922 – May 6, 1983) was a Danish-born American trombonist and jazz composer. He is known for his collaborations with fellow trombonist J. J. Johnson. His version of &quot;More&quot;, the theme from the movie &quot;Mondo Cane&quot;, reached in 1963 number 8 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and remained his only entry here.

==Biography==
Winding was born in Aarhus, Denmark. His father, Ove Winding was a naturalized U.S. citizen, thus Kai, his mother and sisters, though born abroad were already U.S. citizens. In September 1934, his mother, Jenny Winding, moved Kai and his two sisters, Ann and Alice. Kai graduated in 1940 from Stuyvesant High School in New York City and that same year began his career as a professional trombonist with Shorty Allen&#x27;s band. Subsequently, he played with Sonny Dunham and Alvino Rey, until he entered the United States Coast Guard during World War II.

After the war, Winding was a member of Benny Goodman&#x27;s orchestra, then Stan Kenton&#x27;s. He participated in &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; sessions in 1949, appearing on four of the twelve tracks, while J. J. Johnson appeared on the other eight, having participated on the other two sessions. 
In 1954, at the urging of producer Ozzie Cadena, Winding began a long association with Johnson, recording trombone duets for Savoy Records, then Columbia. He experimented with instruments in brass ensembles. The album &quot;Jay &amp; Kai + 6&quot; (1956) featured a trombone octet and the trombonium. He composed and arranged many of the works he and Johnson recorded.

During the 1960s, Winding began an association with Verve Records and producer Creed Taylor. He released the first version of &quot;Time Is On My Side&quot; in 1963 before it was recorded by Irma Thomas and The Rolling Stones. His best selling recording from this period is &quot;More,&quot; the theme from the movie &quot;Mondo Cane&quot;, which reached number 8 in the Billboard Hot 100 and remained his only entry here. Arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman, &quot;More&quot; featured what is probably the first appearance of the French electronic music instrument the ondioline on an American recording. Although Winding was credited with playing the ondioline, guitarist Vinnie Bell, who worked on the session, claimed that it was played by Jean-Jacques Perrey, a pioneer of electronic music. Winding experimented with ensembles again, recorded solo albums, and one album of country music with the Anita Kerr Singers. He followed Creed Taylor to A&amp;M/CTI and made more albums with J. J. Johnson. He was a member of the all-star jazz group Giants of Jazz in 1971.

His son, Jai Winding, is a keyboardist who has worked as a session musician, writer and producer in Los Angeles.

Kai Winding was taken to a hospital because of a reoccurring brain disease that he found out about while in Yonkers, New York, and later died from complications there sometime in 1983.

<text>HMCS &quot;Victoria&quot; is a long-range hunter-killer (SSK) submarine of the Royal Canadian Navy, the lead ship of her class. She is named after the city of Victoria, British Columbia. She was purchased from the Royal Navy, and is the former HMS &quot;Unseen&quot; (S41). The class was also renamed from the &quot;Upholder&quot; class.

==Design==

As built the &quot;Upholder&quot;/&quot;Victoria&quot; class was designed as a replacement for the for use as hunter-killer and training subs. The submarines, which have a single-skinned, teardrop-shaped hull, displace surfaced and submerged. They are long overall with a beam of and a draught of .

The submarines are powered by a one shaft diesel-electric system. They are equipped with two Paxman Valenta 1600 RPS SZ diesel engines each driving a GEC electric alternator with two 120-cell chloride batteries. The batteries have a 90-hour endurance at . The ship is propelled by a GEC dual armature electric motor turning a seven-blade fixed pitch propeller. They have a diesel capacity. This gives the subs a maximum speed of on the surface and submerged. They have a range of at and at snorting depth. The class has a reported dive depth of over .

The &quot;Upholder&quot;/&quot;Victoria&quot; class are armed with six torpedo tubes. In British service, the submarines were equipped with 14 Tigerfish Mk 24 Mod 2 torpedoes and four UGM-84 Sub-Harpoon missiles. They could also be adapted for use as a minelayer. The submarines have Type 1007 radar and Type 2040, Type 2019, Type 2007 and Type 2046 sonar installed. The hull is fitted with elastomeric acoustic tiles to reduce acoustic signature. In British service the vessels had a complement of seven officers and 40 ratings.

===Refits and Canadian alterations===
During the refit for Canadian service, the Sub-Harpoon and mine capabilities were removed and the submarines were equipped with the Lockheed Martin Librascope Submarine fire-control system (SFCS) to meet the operational requirements of the Canadian Navy. Components from the fire control system of the &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines were installed. This gave the submarines the ability to fire the Gould Mk 48 Mod 4 torpedo. In 2014, the Government of Canada purchased 12 upgrade kits that will allow the submarines to fire the Mk 48 Mod 7AT torpedoes.

These radar and sonar systems were later upgraded with the installation of the BAE Type 2007 array and the Type 2046 towed array. The Canadian Towed Array Sonar (CANTASS) has been integrated into the towed sonar suite. The &quot;Upholder&quot;-class submarines were equipped with the CK035 electro-optical search periscope and the CH085 optronic attack periscope, originally supplied by Pilkington Optronics. After the Canadian refit, the submarines were equipped with Canadian communication equipment and electronic support measures (ESM). This included two SSE decoy launchers and the AR 900 ESM.

==Construction and career==
The submarine&#x27;s keel was laid down as HMS &quot;Unseen&quot; at Cammell Laird&#x27;s Birkenhead yard on 12 August 1987. The submarine was launched on 14 November 1989 and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 20 July 1991. &quot;Unseen&quot; was decommissioned on 6 April 1994, and placed in reserve in June.

===Transfer and Canadian service===
Looking to discontinue the operation of diesel-electric boats, the British government offered to sell &quot;Unseen&quot; and her sister submarines to Canada in 1993. The offer was accepted in 1998. The four boats were leased to the Canada for US$427 million, plus US$98 million for upgrades and alteration to Canadian standards.

&quot;Unseen&quot; was the first to be reactivated, and was due to enter service in May 2000. However, problems were discovered with the piping welds on all four submarines, which delayed the reactivation. &quot;Unseen&quot; was handed over to the Canadian Navy on 6 October 2000 and departed for Canada on 9 October. For the majority of the transit across the Atlantic, the submarine travelled submerged, arriving on 23 October. The submarine was commissioned into Maritime Command as &quot;Victoria&quot; at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 2 December 2000.

===Damage===
On arrival in Halifax, &quot;Victoria&quot; was placed into dockyard hands for a refit. This was originally scheduled to take six months, but was not completed until 2003. In April 2002, while in drydock, a dent was discovered in the hull below the waterline. This contributed to the delayed refit. &quot;Victoria&quot; was then transferred to Esquimalt, British Columbia, becoming the first Canadian submarine stationed in the Pacific since the 1974 decommissioning of . The submarine was in and out of dock during 2004 and 2005, culminating in a planned two-year repair program in late 2005.

Quoting a &quot;CBC News&quot; report from May 2006:

:Navy technicians caused &quot;catastrophic damage&quot; to one of Canada&#x27;s trouble-plagued submarines two years ago, says a Halifax newspaper report that cited military documents.
:The technicians blew out the electrical system when they hooked up HMCS &quot;Victoria&quot; to a modern electrical generator, the Halifax Chronicle-Herald reported Saturday.
:&quot;Attempts to use a DC [direct current] feed … caused catastrophic damage to certain onboard filters and power supply units,&quot; the Chronicle-Herald reported, quoting recently released military documents about the incident, which occurred in British Columbia.
:The navy is now spending about $200,000 to buy old electrical equipment that mirrors the original equipment found on the submarine.

===2000 to present===
Between 2000 and 2010, &quot;Victoria&quot; had only been at sea for 115 days; and was expected to re-enter service in mid-2011, after six years in drydock.

As of March 2011, repairs were still ongoing. As of 23 April 2011, the submarine was reported to be out of drydock and going through trials. On 5 December 2011, &quot;Victoria&quot; departed Esquimalt Harbour to conduct sea trials and crew training. &quot;Victoria&quot; arrived at Bangor Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor for deperming (degaussing or the erasure of magnetism) on 13 December 2011, returning to Esquimalt on 16 December.

On 16 March 2012, &quot;Victoria&quot; fired her first exercise torpedo since beginning her refit. While participating in RIMPAC 2012 exercises, &quot;Victoria&quot; successfully fired a Mark 48 torpedo on 17 July 2012 striking and sinking the discarded USNS &quot;Concord&quot;. &quot;Victoria&quot; was declared fully operational in 2012.

&quot;Victoria&quot; participated in Operation Caribbe in 2013. In July 2014, &quot;Victoria&quot; sailed to Hawaii to participate in RIMPAC exercises.

In late 2016, it was announced that all four submarines would reach the end of their service life before 2025 without a large-scale upgrade and refit program. The SELEX (Submarine Life Extension) program was introduced as a result. SELEX will upgrade the outer and inner hulls of the submarines, extending their service life into the early 2030s. SELEX will also upgrade and/or replace the submarines&#x27; engines, power systems, propulsion systems, sonar system, countermeasures, communications systems and warfare suite. The program is expected to cost anywhere from CAD$1.5 billion to CAD$3 billion, the latter of which is only slightly less than the estimated cost of replacing the fleet with new submarines.

To deal with the ongoing battery issues aboard sister boat &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; that began in May 2017, the main battery was transferred from &quot;Victoria&quot; to &quot;Chicoutimi&quot;.

<text>William Sacheverell (1638 – 9 October 1691) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons in two periods between 1670 and 1691.

==Life==
Sacheverell was the son of Henry Sacheverell, a country gentleman, by his wife Joyce Mansfield. His family had been prominent in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire since the 12th century; William inherited large estates from his father. He was admitted to Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1667, and in 1670 he was elected Member of Parliament for Derbyshire. He immediately gained a prominent position in the party hostile to the Court, and before he had been in the House of Commons for six months, he proposed a resolution that all &quot;popish recusants&quot; should be removed from military commands; the motion, enlarged so as to include civil employment, was carried without a division on 28 February 1672–1673. This resolution was the forerunner of the Test Act, in the preparation of which Sacheverell took an active part, and which caused the breakup of the cabal.

Sacheverell took part in nearly every debate in the House of Commons, and was recognized as one of the most able leaders of the opposition or &quot;Country Party&quot;. He strongly opposed the king&#x27;s alliance with France, advocating a league with the Dutch and the refusal of supplies until the demands of the Commons should be complied with. Sacheverell took a special interest in the navy and spoke in many debates on this question. In 1677 he carried an address to the king calling upon him to conclude an alliance with the United Provinces against Louis XIV of France, and when the Speaker adjourned the House by Charles&#x27;s order Sacheverell made an eloquent protest, asserting the right of the House itself to decide the question of its adjournment. When parliament met early in 1678 assurances were received from Charles that he had arranged the treaties demanded by the Commons; but Sacheverell boldly questioned the king&#x27;s good faith, and warned the Commons that they were being deceived. When the secret treaty with France became known, confirming Sacheverell&#x27;s insight, he called for the disbandment of the forces and advocated the refusal of further supplies for military purposes; and in June 1678 he resolutely opposed Lord Danby&#x27;s proposal to grant £300,000 per annum to Charles II for life. Jean Barillon mentions Sacheverell among the Whig leaders who accepted bribes from Louis XIV, but the evidence against him is not conclusive.

When Titus Oates began his &quot;revelations&quot; in 1678, Sacheverell was among those who most firmly believed in the existence of a Popish Plot. He was one of the most active investigators of the affair, and one of the managers in the impeachment of the five Catholic peers. He also acted for a time as chairman of the secret committee of the Commons, and drew up the report on the examination of the Jesuit Coleman, secretary to Mary of Modena, the Duchess of York. He was a member of the committee that drafted the articles of impeachment against Danby in 1678, and was appointed one of the managers of the Commons; and in 1679, when the impeachment, interrupted by the dissolution of parliament, was resumed in the new parliament, he spoke strongly against the validity of Danby&#x27;s plea of pardon by the king.

The allegations in Sacheverell&#x27;s report on the examination of Coleman prompted the country party to demand the exclusion of James, Duke of York, from the succession to the throne, the first suggestion of the famous Exclusion Bill being made by Sacheverell on 4 November 1678 in a debate--&quot;the greatest that ever was in Parliament,&quot; as it was pronounced by contemporaries—raised by Lord Russell with the object of removing the duke from the King&#x27;s Council. He vigorously promoted the bill in the House of Commons and opposed granting supplies until it should pass. When Charles offered an alternative scheme (1679) for limiting the powers of a Catholic sovereign, Sacheverell made a great speech in which he pointed out the insufficiency of the king&#x27;s terms for securing the object desired by the Whigs. In the conflict between the Petitioners and the Abhorrers he supported the former, and on 27 October 1680 brought forward a motion asserting the right of petitioning the king to summon parliament, and proposed the impeachment of Chief Justice North as the author of the proclamation against tumultuous petitioning. Sacheverell was one of the managers on behalf of the Commons at the trial of Lord Stafford in Westminster Hall; but took no further part in public affairs till after the elections of March 1681, when he was returned unopposed for Derbyshire. He was prosecuted for riot in connection with the surrender of the charter of Nottingham in 1682, and tried before George Jeffreys, who fined him 500 marks.

At the general election following the death of Charles II in 1685 Sacheverell lost his seat, and for the next four years he lived in retirement on his estates. In the Convention Parliament summoned by William III in 1689, he sat for Heytesbury. He spoke in favour of a radical resettlement of the constitution, and served on a committee, of which Somers was chairman, for drawing up a new constitution in the form of the Declaration of Right; he was one of the representatives of the Commons in their conference with the peers on the question of declaring the throne vacant. William III appointed Sacheverell a lord of the admiralty, but he resigned the office after a few months. He procured the omission of Lord Jeffreys&#x27;s name from the Act of Indemnity.

In 1690 Sacheverell moved a famous amendment to the Corporation Bill, proposing the addition of a clause for disqualifying for office for seven years municipal functionaries who had surrendered their charters to the Crown. A celebrated debate on this question took place in the House of Commons in January 1690; but the evident intention of the Whigs to perpetuate their own ascendancy by tampering with the franchise contributed largely to the Tory reaction which resulted in the defeat of the Whigs in the elections of that year. Sacheverell was elected member for Nottinghamshire; but be died before taking his seat.

In the judgment of Speaker Onslow, Sacheverell was the &quot;ablest parliament man&quot; of the reign of Charles II. He was one of the earliest English parliamentary orators; his speeches greatly impressed his contemporaries, and in a later generation, as Thomas Macaulay observes, they were &quot;a favourite theme of old men who lived to see the conflicts of Robert Walpole and William Pulteney. Though his fame has become dimmed in comparison with that of Shaftesbury, Russell and Sidney, he was equally conspicuous in the parliamentary proceedings of Charles II&#x27;s reign, and left a more permanent mark than any of them on the constitutional changes of the period.&quot;

==Family==
Sacheverell was twice married. His first wife was Mary, daughter of William Staunton of Staunton; and his second was Jane, daughter of Sir John Newton. His eldest son, Robert, represented the borough of Nottingham in six parliaments. The family became extinct in the male line in 1724.

<text>Angelo Anthony Buono Jr. (October 5, 1934 – September 21, 2002) was an American serial killer, kidnapper and rapist who, together with his adopted cousin Kenneth Bianchi, were known as the Hillside Stranglers. Buono and Bianchi were convicted of killing ten young women in Los Angeles, California, between October 1977 and February 1978.

==Early life==
Angelo Buono was born on October 5, 1934, in Rochester, New York, to first-generation Italian emigrants from San Buono. Buono had developed an extensive criminal history, ranging from failure to pay child support, grand theft auto, assault and rape. In 1975, when Buono was 41 years old, he came into contact with his adopted cousin, Kenneth Bianchi. A self-described &quot;ladies man&quot;, Buono persuaded Bianchi to join him in pimping out two women he had been holding as virtual prisoners.

==Murders==
In October 1977, Buono and Bianchi began killing women. Cruising around Los Angeles, California, in Buono&#x27;s car and using fake badges, the two men persuaded their victims that they were undercover police officers. They would then order the victims into Bianchi&#x27;s Cadillac, which they claimed was an unmarked police car, and drive to Buono&#x27;s home to torture and murder them. The women and girls ranged in age from 12 to 28. The confirmed victims were:

* Yolanda Washington, age 19 – October 17, 1977
* Judith Lynn Miller, age 15 – October 31, 1977
* Lissa Kastin, age 21 – November 5, 1977
* Jane King, age 28 – November 9, 1977
* Dolores Cepeda, age 12 – November 13, 1977
* Sonja Johnson, age 14 – November 13, 1977
* Kristina Weckler, age 20 – November 20, 1977
* Lauren Wagner, age 18 – November 28, 1977
* Kimberly Martin, age 17 – December 13, 1977
* Cindy Lee Hudspeth, age 20 – February 16, 1978

Both Buono and Bianchi would sexually abuse their victims before strangling them. They experimented with other methods of killing, such as lethal injection, electric shock, and carbon monoxide poisoning. Even while committing the murders, Bianchi applied for a job with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and had even been taken for several rides with police officers while they were searching for the Hillside Strangler.

==Trial==
The legal case against Buono was based largely upon Bianchi&#x27;s testimony. Deciding that Bianchi was an unreliable and uncooperative witness, the case&#x27;s original prosecutors from District Attorney John Van de Kamp&#x27;s office moved to dismiss all charges against Buono and set him free. The presiding judge, Ronald M. George, refused to release Buono and reassigned the case to California Attorney General George Deukmejian&#x27;s office. 

Buono&#x27;s trial would become the longest in American legal history, lasting from November 1981 until November 1983. During the trial, Bianchi, in exchange for a lighter sentence, testified against Buono. The jury convicted Buono on nine counts of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment, with Judge George commenting that he felt a death sentence would have been the appropriate punishment.

Bianchi was ultimately sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole.

==Detention, death and aftermath==
In 1986, Buono married Christine Kizuka, a mother of three and a supervisor at the California State Employment Development Department. He died of a heart attack in September 2002 while incarcerated at Calipatria State Prison. His body was cremated.

In 2007, Buono&#x27;s grandson, Christopher Buono, committed suicide shortly after shooting his grandmother, Mary Castillo, in the head. Castillo was at one time married to Buono, and had five children with him, including Chris&#x27; father. Chris Buono was unaware of his grandfather&#x27;s true identity until 2005.

==Media==
In the 1989 film &quot;The Case of the Hillside Stranglers&quot;, Buono was portrayed by actor Dennis Farina. In the 2004 film &quot;The Hillside Strangler&quot;, Buono was portrayed by actor Nicholas Turturro and in &quot;&quot; (2006), he was played by Tomas Arana.

<doc id="242867" wikidata="Q183221" url="?curid=242867" title="Antoine Watteau">
<text>Jean-Antoine Watteau (, , ; baptised 10 October 1684died 18 July 1721) was a French painter and draughtsman whose brief career spurred the revival of interest in colour and movement, as seen in the tradition of Correggio and Rubens. He revitalized the waning Baroque style, shifting it to the less severe, more naturalistic, less formally classical, Rococo. Watteau is credited with inventing the genre of &quot;fêtes galantes&quot;, scenes of bucolic and idyllic charm, suffused with a theatrical air. Some of his best known subjects were drawn from the world of Italian comedy and ballet.

==Early life and training==
Jean-Antoine Watteau was born in October 1684 in Valenciennes, once an important town in the County of Hainaut which became sequently part of the Burgundian and Habsburg Netherlands until its secession to France following the Franco-Dutch War. He was the second of four sons born to Jean-Philippe Watteau (1660–1720) and Michelle Lardenois (1653–1727), and was presumed to be of Walloon descent. The Watteaus were a quite well-to-do family, although Jean-Philippe, a roofer in second generation, was said to be given to brawling. Showing an early interest in painting, Jean-Antoine may have been apprenticed to Jacques-Albert Gérin, a local painter, and his first artistic subjects were charlatans selling quack remedies on the streets of Valenciennes. Watteau left for Paris in 1702. After a period spent as a scene-painter, and in poor health, he found employment in a workshop at Pont Notre-Dame, making copies of popular genre paintings in the Flemish and Dutch tradition; it was in that period that he developed his characteristic sketchlike technique.

His drawings attracted the attention of the painter Claude Gillot, and by 1705 he was employed as an assistant to Gillot, whose work, influenced by those of Francesco Primaticcio and the school of Fontainebleau, represented a reaction against the turgid official art of Louis XIV&#x27;s reign. In Gillot&#x27;s studio, Watteau became acquainted with the characters of the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; (which moved onto the &quot;théâtre de la foire&quot; following the Comédie-Italienne&#x27;s departure in 1697), a favorite subject of Gillot&#x27;s that would become one of Watteau&#x27;s lifelong passions.

After a quarrel with Gillot, Watteau moved to the workshop of Claude Audran III, an interior decorator, under whose influence he began to make drawings admired for their consummate elegance. Audran was the curator of the Palais du Luxembourg, and from him Watteau acquired his knowledge of decorative art and ornamental design. At the palace, Watteau was able to see the magnificent series of canvases painted by Peter Paul Rubens for Queen Marie de Medici. The Flemish painter would become one of his major influences, together with the Venetian masters that he would later study in the collection of his patron and friend, the banker Pierre Crozat.

During this period Watteau painted &quot;The Departing Regiment&quot;, the first picture in his second and more personal manner, showing influence of Rubens, and the first of a long series of camp pictures. He showed the painting to Audran, who made light of it, and advised him not to waste his time and gifts on such subjects. Watteau determined to leave him, advancing as excuse his desire to return to Valenciennes. He found a purchaser, at the modest price of 60 livres, in a man called Sirois, the father-in-law of his later friend and patron Edme-François Gersaint, and was thus enabled to return to the home of his childhood. In Valenciennes he painted a number of the small camp-pieces, notably the &quot;Camp-Fire&quot;, which was again bought by Sirois, the price this time being raised to 200 livres.

==Later career==


In 1709, Watteau tried to obtain a one-year stay in Rome by winning the Prix de Rome from the Academy, but managed only to get awarded with the second prize. In 1712 he tried again and was persuaded by Charles de La Fosse that he had nothing to learn from going to Rome; thanks to Fosse he was accepted as an associate member of the Academy in 1712 and a full member in 1717. He took those five years to deliver the required &quot;reception piece&quot;, one of his masterpieces: the &quot;Pilgrimage to Cythera&quot;, also called the &quot;Embarkation for Cythera&quot;.

Watteau then went to live with the collector Pierre Crozat, who eventually on his death in 1740 left around 400 paintings and 19,000 drawings by the masters. Thus Watteau was able to spend even more time becoming familiar with the works of Rubens and the Venetian masters.
He lacked aristocratic patrons; his buyers were bourgeois such as bankers and dealers. Among his most famous paintings, beside the two versions of the &quot;Pilgrimage to Cythera&quot;, one in the Louvre, the other in the Schloss Charlottenburg, Berlin, are &quot;Pierrot&quot; (long identified as &quot;Gilles&quot;), &quot;Fêtes venitiennes&quot;, &quot;Love in the Italian Theater&quot;, &quot;Love in the French Theater&quot;, &quot;Voulez-vous triompher des belles?&quot; and &quot;Mezzetin&quot;. The subject of his hallmark painting, &quot;Pierrot&quot; (&quot;Gilles&quot;), is an actor in a white satin costume who stands isolated from his four companions, staring ahead with an enigmatic expression on his face.

Watteau&#x27;s final masterpiece, the &quot;Shop-sign of Gersaint&quot;, exits the pastoral forest locale for a mundane urban set of encounters. Painted at Watteau&#x27;s own insistence, &quot;in eight days, working only in the mornings ... in order to warm up his fingers&quot;, this sign for the shop in Paris of the paintings dealer Edme François Gersaint is effectively the final curtain of Watteau&#x27;s theatre. It has been compared with &quot;Las Meninas&quot; as a meditation on art and illusion. The scene is an art gallery where the façade has magically vanished, and the gallery and street in the canvas are fused into one contiguous drama.

Watteau alarmed his friends by a carelessness about his future and financial security, as if foreseeing he would not live for long. In fact he had been sickly and physically fragile since childhood. In 1720, he travelled to London, England, to consult Dr. Richard Mead, one of the most fashionable physicians of his time and an admirer of Watteau&#x27;s work. However, London&#x27;s damp and smoky air offset any benefits of Dr. Mead&#x27;s wholesome food and medicines. Watteau returned to France, spending six months with Gersaint, and then spent his last few months on the estate of his patron, Abbé Haranger, where he died in 1721, perhaps from tuberculous laryngitis, at the age of 36. The Abbé said Watteau was semi-conscious and mute during his final days, clutching a paint brush and painting imaginary paintings in the air.

His nephew, Louis Joseph Watteau, son of Antoine&#x27;s brother Noël Joseph Watteau (1689–1756), and grand nephew, François-Louis-Joseph Watteau, son of Louis, followed Antoine into painting.
==Critical assessment and legacy==
Little known during his lifetime beyond a small circle of his devotees, Watteau &quot;was mentioned but seldom in contemporary art criticism and then usually reprovingly&quot;. Sir Michael Levey once noted that Watteau &quot;created, unwittingly, the concept of the individualistic artist loyal to himself, and himself alone&quot;. If his immediate followers, Lancret and Pater, would depict the unabashed frillery of aristocratic romantic pursuits, Watteau in a few masterpieces anticipates an art &quot;about&quot; art, the world of art as seen through the eyes of an artist. In contrast to the Rococo whimsicality and licentiousness cultivated by Boucher and Fragonard in the later part of Louis XV&#x27;s reign, Watteau&#x27;s theatrical panache is usually tinged with a note of sympathy, wistfulness, and sadness at the transience of love and other earthly delights. Famously, the Victorian essayist Walter Pater wrote of Watteau: &quot;He was always a seeker after something in the world, that is there in no satisfying measure, or not at all.&quot;

Watteau was a prolific draftsman. His drawings, typically executed in &quot;trois crayons&quot; technique, were collected and admired even by those, such as count de Caylus or Gersaint, who found fault with his paintings. In 1726 and 1728, Jean de Jullienne published suites of etchings after Watteau&#x27;s drawings, and in 1735 he published a series of engravings after his paintings, &quot;The Recueil Jullienne&quot;. The quality of the reproductions, using a mixture of engraving and etching following the practice of the Rubens engravers, varied according to the skill of the people employed by Jullienne, but was often very high. Such a comprehensive record was hitherto unparalleled. This helped disseminate his influence round Europe and into the decorative arts.

Watteau&#x27;s influence on the arts (not only painting, but the decorative arts, costume, film, poetry, music) was more extensive than that of almost any other 18th-century artist. The &quot;Watteau dress&quot;, a long, sacklike dress with loose pleats hanging from the shoulder at the back, similar to those worn by many of the women in his paintings, is named after him. According to Konody&#x27;s critical assessment in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, in part, &quot;in his treatment of the landscape background and of the atmospheric surroundings of the figures can be found the germs of Impressionism&quot;. His influence on later generations of painters may have been less apparent in France than in England, where J. M. W. Turner was among his admirers. A revived vogue for Watteau began in England during the British Regency, and was later encapsulated by the Goncourt brothers in France (Edmond de Goncourt having published a in 1875) and the &quot;World of Art&quot; union in Russia.

In 1984 Watteau societies were created in Paris, by Jean Ferré, and London, by Dr. Selby Whittingham. A major exhibition in Paris, Washington and Berlin commemorated the 1984 tercentenary of his birth. Since 2000 a Watteau centre has been established at Valenciennes by Professor Chris Rauseo. A catalogue raisonné of Watteau&#x27;s drawings has been compiled by Pierre Rosenberg and Louis-Antoine Prat, replacing the one by Sir Karl Parker and Jacques Mathey; similar projects on his paintings are undertaken by Alan Wintermute and Martin Eidelberg, respectively.

<text>Kenneth Alessio Bianchi (born May 22, 1951) is an American serial killer, kidnapper, and rapist. He is known for the Hillside Strangler murders committed with his cousin Angelo Buono Jr. in Los Angeles, California, as well as for murdering two more women in Washington by himself. Bianchi is currently serving a sentence of life imprisonment in Washington State Penitentiary for these crimes. Bianchi was also at one time a suspect in the Alphabet murders, three unsolved murders in his home city of Rochester, New York, from 1971 to 1973. He is up for parole in 2025.

== Early life ==
Kenneth Bianchi was born on May 22, 1951, in Rochester, New York, to a 17-year-old alcoholic sex worker who gave him up for adoption two weeks after he was born. He was adopted in August 1951 by Nicholas Bianchi and his wife Frances Scioliono-Bianchi, and was their only child. Bianchi was deeply troubled from a young age, with his adoptive mother describing him as &quot;a compulsive liar&quot; from the time he could talk. He would often fall into inattentive, trance-like daydreams where his eyes would roll back into his head. From these symptoms, a physician diagnosed the 5-year-old Bianchi with petit mal seizures. He was also frequently given physical examinations by doctors because of an involuntary urination problem, causing him a great deal of humiliation. 

Bianchi had many behavioural problems and was prone to fits of anger as well as bouts of insomnia and habitually urinating in his own bed constantly when he was young. On January 2, 1957, Bianchi accidentally fell off of a jungle gym and landed on his face. His mother, in an attempt to change his ways, sent him to a private Catholic elementary school and also responded by taking him to a psychiatrist multiple times, with Bianchi being diagnosed with a passive-aggressive personality disorder at the age of ten. Bianchi&#x27;s intelligence quotient was measured at 116 at the age of eleven, but, despite having above-average intelligence, he was an underachiever and was removed twice from schools because he failed to get along with teachers. Frances described him as &quot;lazy&quot; and his teachers claimed that he was working below his potential.

He pulled down a 6-year-old girl&#x27;s underwear sometime in July 1963 after deciding that he liked doing it. After his adoptive father died suddenly from pneumonia in 1964, the teenaged Bianchi refused to cry or show any other signs of grief. After her husband&#x27;s death, Frances had to work while her son attended a public high school and was known for keeping him home from school for long periods of time. Nonetheless, Bianchi dated frequently and even joined a motorcycle club. Shortly after he graduated from Gates-Chili High School in 1970, Bianchi married his high school sweetheart, Brenda Beck. The union ended after eight months. Supposedly, she left him without an explanation. 

As an adult, Bianchi decided that he wanted to become a police officer, and he enrolled at Monroe Community College to study police science and psychology. He dropped out of college after just one semester, however, and drifted through a series of menial jobs, finally ending up as a security guard at a jewelery store. This gave him the opportunity to steal valuables, which he often gave to girlfriends or prostitutes to buy their loyalty. He applied for a position at the sheriff&#x27;s department but was rejected. 

Because of his many petty thefts, Bianchi was constantly on the move. Bianchi moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1976 and started spending time with his older cousin and Frances&#x27; nephew, Angelo Buono, who impressed Bianchi with his fancy clothes, jewelry, and talent for getting any woman he wanted and &quot;putting them in their place&quot;. Before long, they worked together as pimps and, by late-1977, had escalated to committing what would become known as the &quot;Hillside Strangler&quot; murders. Bianchi and Buono had raped and murdered 10 young women and girls by the time they were arrested in early 1979.

==Murders==
Bianchi and Buono would sexually abuse their victims before strangling them. They experimented with other methods of killing, such as lethal injection, electric shock, and carbon monoxide poisoning. Even while committing the murders, Bianchi applied for a job with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and had even been taken for several rides with police officers while they were searching for the Hillside Strangler. Shortly after Bianchi committed the eleventh and twelfth murders, he revealed to Buono that he had gone on LAPD police ride-alongs and that he was currently being questioned about the Strangler case. Buono flew into a rage and threatened to kill Bianchi if he did not move to Bellingham, Washington, which he did in May 1978, thereby ending their criminal partnership. The crimes and murders that the duo committed are as follows:
*Following his arrest, Bianchi admitted that in 1977 he and Buono, while posing as police officers, stopped a young woman called Catharine Lorre with the intention of abducting and killing her, but released her after learning she was the daughter of actor Peter Lorre. Only after the men were arrested did Catharine learn of their identities.

*The Alphabet murders occurred in and around Rochester from 1971 to 1973. Three young girls were kidnapped, sexually assaulted and murdered. Bianchi was never formally charged in these crimes, but he was a suspect because he worked as an ice cream vendor near two of the murder scenes and drove a car similar to a suspicious vehicle spotted near one of the abduction sites. Bianchi has denied any responsibility for these murders.
*On September 4, 1977, the body of Laura Collins, age 26, was discovered in Griffith Park strangled to death. Collins was initially included by the Los Angeles media as a potential victim of the Hillside Strangler, but a 1979 complaint against Buono and Bianchi did not ultimately list Collins as one of their victims. Buono and Bianchi were never found guilty of her murder or confessed to it. Collins&#x27; death is still unsolved.
* Jill Terry Barcomb, 18, was a woman from Oneida, New York, who was killed in Southern California on November 10, 1977. She was molested, beaten, and strangled and was found rolled up like a ball in a ravine off Mulholland Highway and originally was thought to have been a victim of the Hillside Strangler. However, her case was ultimately decided by authorities to have been unrelated after the arrests of Bianchi and Buono. Neither men confessed or were ever convicted of the murder. In March 2010, serial killer Rodney Alcala was convicted of her murder as well as with four others.
*On November 16, 1977, Kathleen Kimberly Robinson, a 17-year-old high school student and a frequent hitchhiker living in Hollywood was last seen alive near the beach in Santa Monica. The next day, she was discovered dead in a parkway in the Wilshire district of Los Angeles. She was initially believed to be a victim of the Hillside Strangler, but as soon as it was discovered that the circumstances of her case was different from the others, a connection was quickly ruled out. Kathleen&#x27;s murder is still unsolved.

== Trial ==
At his trial, Bianchi pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming that another personality, one &quot;Steve Walker&quot;, had committed the crimes. It was believed he had recently seen the film &quot;Sybil&quot;, about a woman suffering from multiple personalities triggered by childhood abuse. He convinced a few expert psychiatrists that he indeed suffered from multiple personality disorder, but investigators brought in their own psychiatrists, mainly Martin Orne. When Orne mentioned to Bianchi that in genuine cases of the disorder, there tend to be three or more personalities, Bianchi promptly created another alias, &quot;Billy&quot;. 

To prove that Bianchi had lied about having multiple personalities to avoid being prosecuted, Orne tested him by introducing him to his lawyer, who was not present. Bianchi interacted with the imaginary lawyer. Orne then brought in his real lawyer, flustering Bianchi, who claimed that the imaginary lawyer had vanished. Prior to his actual lawyer&#x27;s appearance, Bianchi even leaned over to shake the hand of the imaginary one; an action which is referred to as &quot;tactile hallucinations&quot; that experts explained is an event that rarely, if ever, happens during hypnosis nor other types of neurological-event triggered hallucination. Orne had never seen a true &quot;tactile hallucination&quot; in his career, suggesting that this was a complete fabrication. Bianchi eventually pleaded guilty in order to avoid the death penalty in Washington State.

Eventually, investigators discovered that the name &quot;Steven Walker&quot; came from a student whose identity Bianchi had previously attempted to steal for the purpose of fraudulently practicing psychology. Police also found a small library of books in Bianchi&#x27;s home on topics of modern psychology, further suggestion of his ability to fake the disorder. Once his claims were subjected to scrutiny, Bianchi eventually admitted that he had been faking the disorder. He was eventually diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder with sexual sadism disorder.

In an attempt to obtain a reduced sentence, Bianchi agreed to testify against Buono. However, in giving his testimony, he made every effort to be as uncooperative and self-contradictory as possible, apparently hoping to avert Buono&#x27;s conviction. In the end, Bianchi&#x27;s efforts were unsuccessful, as Buono was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Bianchi himself was also ultimately sentenced to six terms of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole.

In 1980, Bianchi began a relationship with Veronica Compton, a woman he had met while in prison. During his trial, she testified for the defense, telling the jury a false, vague tale about the crimes in an attempt to exculpate Bianchi. She also admitted to wanting to buy a mortuary with another convicted murderer for the purpose of necrophilia. She was later convicted and imprisoned for attempting to strangle a woman she had lured to a motel in an attempt to convince authorities that the Hillside Strangler was still on the loose. Bianchi had allegedly given her some semen during a prison visit to plant on the planned victim to make it look like a rape/murder committed by the Strangler.

In 1992, Bianchi sued Catherine Yronwode for $8.5 million for having an image of his face depicted on a trading card; he claimed his face was trademarked. The judge dismissed the case after ruling that, if Bianchi had been using his face as a trademark when he was killing women, he would not have tried to hide it from the police.

== Detention ==
Bianchi is serving his sentence at Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla, Washington. He was denied parole on August 18, 2010, by a state board in Sacramento. He will be eligible to apply for parole again in 2025.

==Media==
In the 1989 film &quot;The Case of the Hillside Stranglers&quot;, Bianchi was portrayed by actor Billy Zane. In the 2004 film &quot;The Hillside Strangler&quot;, Bianchi was portrayed by actor C. Thomas Howell and in &quot;&quot; (2006), he was played by Clifton Collins Jr..

<text>William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath, (22 March 16847 July 1764) was an English Whig politician and peer who sat in the British House of Commons from 1707 to 1742 when he was raised to the peerage as the Earl of Bath by George II of Great Britain. He is sometimes represented as having served as First Lord of the Treasury and Prime Minister of Great Britain as part of the short-lived ministry in 1746, although most modern sources do not consider him to have held the office.

==Background and early career==
The son of William Pulteney by his first wife, Mary Floyd, he was born in March 1684 into an old Leicestershire family. He was educated at Westminster School and at Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating on 31 October 1700. He acquired extensive classical knowledge, and on leaving Oxford made the usual tour on the continent. In 1705, he was brought into parliament by Henry Guy (former secretary of the Treasury) for the Yorkshire borough of Hedon. This seat was held by him without a break until 1734.

Throughout the reign of Queen Anne William Pulteney played a prominent part in the struggles of the Whigs, and was involved in the prosecution of Henry Sacheverell. When the victorious Tories sent his friend Robert Walpole to the Tower of London in 1712, Pulteney championed his cause in the House of Commons and with the leading Whigs visited him in prison.

==Ministerial offices==

Pulteney was secretary of war from 1714 to 1717 in the first ministry of George I, and was on the committee of secrecy on the Treaty of Utrecht, formed in April 1715. Two years later, on 6 July 1716, he became one of the privy council. When Townshend was dismissed, in April 1717, from his post of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and Walpole resigned, they were followed in their retirement by Pulteney. 

The crash of the South Sea Company restored Walpole to the highest position, but all he offered to Pulteney was a peerage. Pulteney rejected the offer, but in May 1723 Pulteney agreed to accept the lucrative but insignificant post of Cofferer of the Household. However, when he found himself neglected, he opposed the proposition of Walpole to discharge the debts of the civil list, and in April 1725 was dismissed from his sinecure.

He was one of the original backers of the Royal Academy of Music, establishing a London opera company which commissioned numerous works from Handel, Bononcini and others.

==Patriot Whigs==
From the day of his dismissal to that of his ultimate triumph, Pulteney remained in opposition, forming the Patriot Whigs, a group of fellow Whigs who felt that Walpole was corrupt and tyrannical. Walpole&#x27;s attempt&#x27;s 1730 at conciliation with the offer of Townshend&#x27;s place and of a peerage was spurned. Pulteney&#x27;s resentment was not confined to his speeches in parliament. 

With Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke he started, in December 1726, a periodical called &quot;The Craftsman&quot;, and in its pages the minister was incessantly denounced for many years. Lord Hervey published an attack on the &quot;Craftsman&quot;, and Pulteney, either openly or behind the person of Amhurst, its editor, replied to the attack. Whether the question at issue was the civil list, the excise, the income of the Prince of Wales, or the state of domestic affairs, Pulteney was ready with a pamphlet, and the minister or one of his friends came out with a reply. 

For his &quot;Proper reply to a late scurrilous libel&quot; (&quot;Craftsman&quot;, 1731), an answer to &quot;Sedition and defamation displayed,&quot; he was challenged to a duel by Lord Hervey; for another, &quot;An answer to one part of an infamous libel entitled remarks on the Craftsman&#x27;s indication of his two honourable patrons,&quot; he was in July 1731 struck off the roll of privy councillors and dismissed from the commission of the peace in several counties. 

In print, Pulteney was inferior to Bolingbroke alone among the antagonists of Walpole, but in parliament, from which Bolingbroke was excluded, he excelled. When the sinking fund was appropriated in 1733 he led the denunciation; when the excise scheme in the same year was stirring popular feeling to its lowest depths the passion of the multitude broke out in his oratory. Walpole managed to avoid the fall of his ministry. Bolingbroke withdrew to France on the suggestion, it is said, of Pulteney, and the opposition was weakened by the dissensions of the leaders.

From the general election of 1734 until his elevation to the peerage, Pulteney sat for Middlesex. For some years after this election the minister&#x27;s assailants made little progress in their attack, but in 1738 the troubles with Spain supplied them with the opportunity which they desired. Walpole long argued for peace, but he was feebly supported by his own cabinet, and the frenzy of the people for war knew no bounds. In an evil moment for his own reputation he consented to remain in office and to gratify popular passion with a war against Spain. His downfall was not long deferred. War was declared in 1739, a new parliament was summoned in the summer of 1741, and over the divisions on the election petitions the ministry of Walpole collapsed.

The task of forming the new administration was after some delay entrusted to Pulteney, who offered the post of First Lord of the Treasury (Prime Minister) to the Earl of Wilmington, and contented himself with a seat in the cabinet and a peerage, still hoping to retain his supremacy in the ministry. This made him unpopular, and his influence dwindled to nothing.

Horace Walpole asserts that when Pulteney wished to withdraw from the peerage it was forced upon him by the king, and another chronicler of the times records that when Walpole and Pulteney met in the House of Lords, the one as Earl of Orford, the other as Earl of Bath, the remark was made by Orford: &quot;Here we are, my lord, the two most insignificant fellows in England.&quot; On 14 July 1742 Pulteney was created Baron Pulteney of Heydon, Viscount Pulteney of Wrington, Somerset, and Earl of Bath. On 20 February he had been restored to his rank in the privy council. At Wilmington&#x27;s death in 1743 he made application to the king for the post of First Lord of the Treasury, only to find that it had been conferred on Henry Pelham.

==Prime minister==

On 10 February 1746, Pelham&#x27;s administration resigned &quot;en masse&quot;, and the king turned to Bath to form an alternative ministry. He accepted the seals of office and made nominations to the most senior posts, but it quickly became clear that he did not have enough support to form a viable government, and after &quot;48 hours, three quarters, seven minutes, and eleven seconds&quot; he abandoned the attempt, forcing the king to accept Pelham&#x27;s terms for resuming office. As the office of Prime Minister did not then officially exist, it is a matter of controversy whether Bath should be considered to have been Prime Minister by virtue of his two-day ministry.

Bath&#x27;s failed attempt to form a government brought him much ridicule. Horace Walpole recorded the joke that &quot;Granville and Bath were met going about the streets, calling &#x27;Odd Man&#x27;, as the hackney chairmen do when they want a partner&quot;, and a contemporary pamphlet satirically praised him for &quot;the most wise and honest of all administrations, the minister having ... never transacted one rash thing; and, what is more marvellous, left as much money in the T[reasur]y as he found in it.&quot;

==Death and legacy==

An occasional pamphlet and an infrequent speech were afterwards the sole fruits of Bath&#x27;s talents. His praises whilst in retirement have been sung by two bishops, Zachary Pearce and Thomas Newton. In 1762, two years before his death, he served as treasurer of the Salop Infirmary in Shrewsbury. He was buried on 17 July 1764, in his own vault in Islip chapel, Westminster Abbey. The monument is by the sculptor Joseph Wilton.

He married on 27 December 1714 Anna Maria, daughter and co-heiress of John Gumley of Isleworth, commissary general to the army who was often satirized by the wits of the day (&quot;Notes and Queries&quot;, 3rd S. iI. 40 2-403, ~ 490). Anna Maria was the aunt of Rev. Dr. John Lockman, Canon of Windsor. She died on 14 September 1758, and their only son William Pulteney died unmarried at Madrid on 12 February 1763. Pulteney&#x27;s vast fortune passed in 1767 to Frances, wife of William Johnstone and daughter and co-heiress of his cousin, Daniel Pulteney, a bitter antagonist of Walpole in parliament, and had taken the name of Pulteney.

Of business he was never fond, and the loss in 1734 of his trusted friend John Merrill, who had supplied the qualities which he lacked, was lamented by him in a letter to Jonathan Swift.

The town of Poultney, Vermont and the Poultney River were named for him.

<text>Hana Mandlíková (born 19 February 1962) is a Czech–Australian former professional tennis player. She was ranked world No. 3 in women&#x27;s singles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) in the mid-1980s. Mandíková won 27 WTA Tour-level singles titles, including four majors: the 1980 Australian Open, 1981 French Open, 1985 US Open and 1987 US Open. She was the runner-up at a further four singles majors – twice at Wimbledon and twice at the US Open. She also won 19 career doubles titles, including a major in women&#x27;s doubles at the 1989 US Open partnering Martina Navratilova. Competing for Czechoslovakia and later Australia, Mandlíková was one of the brightest stars of her generation and is considered one of the greatest female players of the Open Era. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1994.

Mandlíková was ranked in the top 50 for twelve consecutive seasons (1978–89), including seven seasons ranked in the top 10. She led Czechoslovakia to three consecutive Federation Cup victories from 1983 to 1985, and was only the third woman to win Grand Slam titles on grass (the Australian Open was a grass-court tournament until 1988), clay and hardcourts, joining Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova. She retired in 1990, and went on to coach Jana Novotná to the Wimbledon singles title and a career-high ranking of world No. 2. Mandlíková also served as the Czech Republic&#x27;s Olympic and Fed Cup coach.

==Early life==
Born in Prague, Mandlíková is the daughter of Vilém Mandlík, who was an Olympic 200-metre semi-finalist for Czechoslovakia at the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne. He also competed in the 1960 Rome Olympics.

==Career==
===Junior===
Mandlíková first came to the tennis world&#x27;s attention as a junior. In 1978, the International Tennis Federation launched world junior rankings, and Mandlíková became the first female world No. 1 junior.

===Professional===
Mandlíková captured her first Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open in 1980, aged 18, defeating Australian Wendy Turnbull in straight sets in the final. Her second came the following year at the French Open with straight-sets wins over Chris Evert in the semifinals and West German Sylvia Hanika in the final. Mandlíková was also runner-up at the US Open in 1980 and 1982 and at Wimbledon in 1981, losing in all three finals to Evert. From the 1980 US Open through to Wimbledon 1981, she made four consecutive Grand Slam singles final appearances. Mandlíková ended Chris Evert&#x27;s 72-match winning streak on clay at the 1981 French Open.

In 1983, Mandlíková led Czechoslovakia to the first of three consecutive Federation Cup titles. The following year, she defeated Martina Navratilova in three sets in the final at Oakland, California, ending Navratilova&#x27;s 54-match winning streak, two short of tying the record held by Evert at the time. Navratilova then embarked on a 74-match winning streak, a record that still stands. It was in April 1984 that Mandlíková first achieved her career-high world No. 3 ranking.

At the 1985 US Open, Mandlíková became the first woman since Tracy Austin to defeat both Evert and Navratilova in the same tournament when she stopped top-seeded Evert in the semifinals and then second-seeded Navratilova in the three-set final. This victory in the final made her only the third woman, after Evert and Navratilova, to win Grand Slam titles on grass, clay and hard court.

The following year, Mandlíková teamed with Turnbull to win the women&#x27;s doubles title at the WTA Tour Championships. In doing so, they defeated the top two teams at the time - Navratilova and Pam Shriver in the semifinals and Claudia Kohde-Kilsch and Helena Suková in the final. Mandlíková and Turnbull were also runners-up to Navratilova and Shriver at Wimbledon and the US Open in 1986. Mandlíková also lost in the Wimbledon singles final that year to Navratilova.

A high point of Mandlíková&#x27;s European summer in 1986 was a win over Steffi Graf in the quarterfinals of the French Open. Graf had won four titles that season on clay with victories over Mandlíková, Evert, Navratilova, Kohde Kilsch, and Gabriela Sabatini, and held a match point in the second set of their quarterfinal before Mandlíková broke another winning streak. Graf had won her previous 23 matches.

In 1987, Mandlíková won her fourth and final Grand Slam singles title when she conquered Navratilova in straight sets in the final of the Australian Open. With this victory, she once again ended a Navratilova winning run, this time after 56 matches. This was the last Australian Open played on grass.

Mandlíková attained Australian citizenship in 1988, and her last consistent performance in a Grand Slam event was at the 1988 Australian Open, where, as the defending champion at the new hard court venue, she reached the quarterfinals before losing to eventual champion Graf. Injury problems Mandlíková had been experiencing for several years saw her year-end ranking for 1988 drop to 29, her lowest since 1978.

She teamed with Pat Cash to represent Australia in the first edition of the Hopman Cup, reaching the final played on New Year&#x27;s Day 1989, but losing to Czechoslovakia. In September she teamed with Navratilova to win the US Open women&#x27;s doubles title, defeating Shriver and Mary Joe Fernández in the final. Mandlíková ended the 1989 season ranked 14 in the world.

Ten years after her first Grand Slam victory, Mandlíková retired from the professional tennis tour in 1990 at age 28, having won 27 singles and 19 doubles titles. Her Federation Cup win-loss singles record is 34–6. Mandlíková is one of only 13 women during the Open Era to have reached the singles finals of all four Grand Slam tournaments.

During her professional career, Mandlíková was coached by former player Betty Stöve.

Mandlíková was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1994 and received the Hall of Fame ring in 2017.

== Personal life ==
Mandlíková married Czech-born Australian restaurateur Jan Sedlak at the Old Town Hall in Prague during 1986 Federation Cup. The couple divorced two years later, shortly after Mandlíková obtained Australian citizenship.

In May 2001, she gave birth to twins Mark Vilém and Elizabeth Hana. Their father was a friend who was to have no role in their upbringing.

<text>William Coxe (8 June 1828) was an English historian and priest who served as a travelling companion and tutor to nobility from 1771 to 1786. He wrote numerous historical works and travel chronicles. Ordained a deacon in 1771, he served as a rector and then archdeacon of Bemerton near Salisbury from 1786 until his death.

==Biography==
William Coxe was born on in Dover Street, Piccadilly, London, the eldest son of William Coxe (c. 17101760), a physician to the king&#x27;s household, and his wife, Martha, daughter of Paul D&#x27;Aranda. He was the older brother of the writer and poet Peter Coxe (c. 1753–1844), who wrote the poem &quot;Social Day&quot;. Following his father&#x27;s death in 1760, his mother married John Christopher Smith, who was Handel&#x27;s amanuensis.

Educated at Marylebone Grammar School (1753–54) and then at Eton College (1754–64), Coxe matriculated to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge at Easter 1765. He received his BA in 1769, and his MA in 1772. From 1768 to 1771, he was a fellow of King&#x27;s College. Coxe was ordained a deacon in London on 21 December 1771 and a priest on 15 March 1772.

Coxe travelled throughout Europe as a tutor and travelling companion to various noblemen and gentlemen, including Lord Herbert, son of the Earl of Pembroke; and Samuel Whitbread of the brewing family. He wrote prodigious and detailed accounts of his travels with Lord Herbert around the Swiss and French Alps, which were subsequently published.

In 1786 he was appointed vicar of Kingston upon Thames, and in 1788 rector of Fugglestone St Peter-with-Bemerton, Wiltshire. He also held the rectory of Stourton, Wiltshire from 1801 to 1811 and that of Fovant from 1811 until his death. In 1791 he was made prebendary of Salisbury, and in 1804 Archdeacon of Wilts until his death twenty-four years later at age 80. He died on 8 June 1828 in Bemerton, and was buried in the chancel of St Peter&#x27;s Church at Fugglestone St Peter. His library was sold from the rectory at Bemerton by London bookseller R. H. Evans, on 11 August 1828 (and four following days). A priced copy of the catalogue, containing many of Coxe&#x27;s works, is at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.132(13)).

In 1803, Coxe married Eleanora, daughter of William Shairp, consul-general for Russia, and widow of Thomas Yeldham of St Petersburg.

Coxe&#x27;s literary style featured a detached, unemotional, objective voice that, though typical of the historiography of his day, came to be seen as arch and quaint by later generations.

==Works==
In addition to his travel writing, during his long residence at Bemerton Coxe was mainly occupied in literary work. His publications included:

<text>Building on major scientific breakthroughs made during the 1930s, the United Kingdom began the world&#x27;s first nuclear weapons research project, codenamed Tube Alloys, in 1941, during World War II. The United States, in collaboration with the United Kingdom, initiated the Manhattan Project the following year to build a weapon using nuclear fission. The project also involved Canada. In August 1945, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were conducted by the United States, with British consent, against Japan at the close of that war, standing to date as the only use of nuclear weapons in hostilities.

The Soviet Union started development shortly after with their own atomic bomb project, and not long after, both countries were developing even more powerful fusion weapons known as hydrogen bombs. Britain and France built their own systems in the 1950s, and the number of states with nuclear capabilities has gradually grown larger in the decades since.

A nuclear weapon, also known as an atomic bomb, possesses enormous destructive power from nuclear fission, or a combination of fission and fusion reactions.

==Background==

In the first decades of the 20th century, physics was revolutionized with developments in the understanding of the nature of atoms including the discoveries in atomic theory by John Dalton. Around the turn of the 20th century, it was discovered by Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden and then Ernest Rutherford, that atoms had a highly dense, very small, charged central core called an atomic nucleus. In 1898, Pierre and Marie Curie discovered that pitchblende, an ore of uranium, contained a substance—which they named radium—that emitted large amounts of radiation. Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy identified that atoms were breaking down and turning into different elements. Hopes were raised among scientists and laymen that the elements around us could contain tremendous amounts of unseen energy, waiting to be harnessed.

H. G. Wells was inspired by the work of Rutherford to write about an &quot;atom bomb&quot; in a 1914 novel, &quot;The World Set Free&quot;, which appeared shortly before the First World War. In a 1924 article, Winston Churchill speculated about the possible military implications: &quot;Might not a bomb no bigger than an orange be found to possess a secret power to destroy a whole block of buildings—nay to concentrate the force of a thousand tons of cordite and blast a township at a stroke?&quot;

In January 1933, the Nazis came to power in Germany and suppressed Jewish scientists. Physicist Leo Szilard fled to London where, in 1934, he patented the idea of a nuclear chain reaction via neutrons. The patent also introduced the term &quot;critical mass&quot; to describe the minimum amount of material required to sustain the chain reaction and its potential to cause an explosion (British patent 630,726). The patent was not about an atomic bomb &quot;per se&quot;, as the possibility of chain reaction was still very speculative. Szilard subsequently assigned the patent to the British Admiralty so that it could be covered by the Official Secrets Act. This work of Szilard&#x27;s was ahead of the time, five years before the public discovery of nuclear fission and eight years before a working nuclear reactor. When he coined the term &quot;neutron inducted chain reaction&quot;, he was not sure about the use of isotopes or standard forms of elements. Despite this uncertainty, he correctly theorized uranium and thorium as primary candidates for such a reaction, along with beryllium which was later determined to be unnecessary in practice. Szilard joined Enrico Fermi in developing the first uranium-fuelled nuclear reactor, Chicago Pile-1, which was activated at the University of Chicago in 1942.

In Paris in 1934, Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie discovered that artificial radioactivity could be induced in stable elements by bombarding them with alpha particles; in Italy Enrico Fermi reported similar results when bombarding uranium with neutrons.

In December 1938, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann reported that they had detected the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons. Lise Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch correctly interpreted these results as being due to the splitting of the uranium atom. Frisch confirmed this experimentally on January 13, 1939. They gave the process the name &quot;fission&quot; because of its similarity to the splitting of a cell into two new cells. Even before it was published, news of Meitner&#x27;s and Frisch&#x27;s interpretation crossed the Atlantic. In their second publication on nuclear fission in February 1939, Hahn and Strassmann predicted the existence and liberation of additional neutrons during the fission process, opening up the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction.
After learning about the German fission in 1939, Leo Szilard concluded that uranium would be the element which can realize his 1933 idea about nuclear chain reaction.

In the United States, scientists at Columbia University in New York City decided to replicate the experiment and on January 25, 1939, conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States in the basement of Pupin Hall. The following year, they identified the active component of uranium as being the rare isotope uranium-235.

Between 1939 and 1940, Joliot-Curie&#x27;s team applied for a patent family covering different use cases of atomic energy, one (case III, in patent FR 971,324 - &quot;Perfectionnements aux charges explosives&quot;, meaning &quot;Improvements in Explosive Charges&quot;) being the first official document explicitly mentioning a nuclear explosion as a purpose, including for war. This patent was applied for on May 4, 1939, but only granted in 1950, being withheld by French authorities in the meantime.

Uranium appears in nature primarily in two isotopes: uranium-238 and uranium-235. When the nucleus of uranium-235 absorbs a neutron, it undergoes nuclear fission, releasing energy and, on average, 2.5 neutrons. Because uranium-235 releases more neutrons than it absorbs, it can support a chain reaction and so is described as fissile. Uranium-238, on the other hand, is not fissile as it does not normally undergo fission when it absorbs a neutron.

By the start of the war in September 1939, many scientists likely to be persecuted by the Nazis had already escaped. Physicists on both sides were well aware of the possibility of utilizing nuclear fission as a weapon, but no one was quite sure how it could be engineered. In August 1939, concerned that Germany might have its own project to develop fission-based weapons, Albert Einstein signed a letter to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt warning him of the threat.

Roosevelt responded by setting up the Uranium Committee under Lyman James Briggs but, with little initial funding ($6,000), progress was slow. It was not until the U.S. entered the war in December 1941 that Washington decided to commit the necessary resources to a top-secret high priority bomb project.

Organized research first began in Britain and Canada as part of the Tube Alloys project: the world&#x27;s first nuclear weapons project. The Maud Committee was set up following the work of Frisch and Rudolf Peierls who calculated uranium-235&#x27;s critical mass and found it to be much smaller than previously thought which meant that a deliverable bomb should be possible. In the February 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum they stated that: &quot;The energy liberated in the explosion of such a super-bomb...will, for an instant, produce a temperature comparable to that of the interior of the sun. The blast from such an explosion would destroy life in a wide area. The size of this area is difficult to estimate, but it will probably cover the centre of a big city.&quot;

Edgar Sengier, a director of Shinkolobwe Mine in the Congo which produced by far the highest quality uranium ore in the world, had become aware of uranium&#x27;s possible use in a bomb. In late 1940, fearing that it might be seized by the Germans, he shipped the mine&#x27;s entire stockpile of ore to a warehouse in New York.

For 18 months British research outpaced the American but by mid-1942, it became apparent that the industrial effort required was beyond Britain&#x27;s already stretched wartime economy.

In September 1942, General Leslie Groves was appointed to lead the U.S. project which became known as the Manhattan Project. Two of his first acts were to obtain authorization to assign the highest priority AAA rating on necessary procurements, and to order the purchase of all 1,250 tons of the Shinkolobwe ore. The Tube Alloys project was quickly overtaken by the U.S. effort and after Roosevelt and Churchill signed the Quebec Agreement in 1943, it was relocated and amalgamated into the Manhattan Project. Canada provided uranium and plutonium for the project.

Szilard started to acquire high-quality graphite and uranium, which were the necessary materials for building a large-scale chain reaction experiment. This experiment was successfully demonstrated on December 2, 1942, at the University of Chicago. The success of this demonstration and technological breakthrough were partially due to Szilard&#x27;s new atomic theories, his uranium lattice design, and the identification and mitigation of a key graphite impurity (boron) through a joint collaboration with graphite suppliers.

==From Los Alamos to Hiroshima==

The beginning of the American research about nuclear weapons (The Manhattan Project) started with the Einstein–Szilárd letter.

With a scientific team led by J. Robert Oppenheimer, the Manhattan project brought together some of the top scientific minds of the day, including exiles from Europe, with the production power of American industry for the goal of producing fission-based explosive devices before Germany. Britain and the U.S. agreed to pool their resources and information, but the main other Allied power, the Soviet Union (USSR), was not informed. The U.S. made a tremendous investment in the project, then the second largest industrial enterprise ever seen, spread across more than 30 sites in the U.S. and Canada. Scientific development was centralized in a secret laboratory at Los Alamos.

For a fission weapon to operate, there must be sufficient fissile material to support a chain reaction, a critical mass. To separate the fissile uranium-235 isotope from the non-fissile uranium-238, two methods were developed which took advantage of the fact that uranium-238 has a slightly greater atomic mass: electromagnetic separation and gaseous diffusion. Another secret site was erected at rural Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for the large-scale production and purification of the rare isotope, which required considerable investment. At the time, K-25, one of the Oak Ridge facilities, was the world&#x27;s largest factory under one roof. The Oak Ridge site employed tens of thousands of people at its peak, most of whom had no idea what they were working on.

Although uranium-238 cannot be used for the initial stage of an atomic bomb, when it absorbs a neutron, it becomes uranium-239 which decays into neptunium-239, and finally the relatively stable plutonium-239, which is fissile like uranium-235. After Fermi achieved the world&#x27;s first sustained and controlled nuclear chain reaction with the creation of the first atomic pile, massive reactors were secretly constructed at what is now known as the Hanford Site to transform uranium-238 into plutonium for a bomb.

The simplest form of nuclear weapon is a gun-type fission weapon, where a sub-critical mass would be shot at another sub-critical mass. The result would be a super-critical mass and an uncontrolled chain reaction that would create the desired explosion. The weapons envisaged in 1942 were the two gun-type weapons, Little Boy (uranium) and Thin Man (plutonium), and the Fat Man plutonium implosion bomb.

In early 1943 Oppenheimer determined that two projects should proceed forwards: the Thin Man project (plutonium gun) and the Fat Man project (plutonium implosion). The plutonium gun was to receive the bulk of the research effort, as it was the project with the most uncertainty involved. It was assumed that the uranium gun-type bomb could then be adapted from it.

In December 1943 the British mission of 19 scientists arrived in Los Alamos. Hans Bethe became head of the Theoretical Division.

In April 1944 it was found by Emilio Segrè that the plutonium-239 produced by the Hanford reactors had too high a level of background neutron radiation, and underwent spontaneous fission to a very small extent, due to the unexpected presence of plutonium-240 impurities. If such plutonium were used in a gun-type design, the chain reaction would start in the split second before the critical mass was fully assembled, blowing the weapon apart with a much lower yield than expected, in what is known as a fizzle.

As a result, development of Fat Man was given high priority. Chemical explosives were used to implode a sub-critical sphere of plutonium, thus increasing its density and making it into a critical mass. The difficulties with implosion centered on the problem of making the chemical explosives deliver a perfectly uniform shock wave upon the plutonium sphere— if it were even slightly asymmetric, the weapon would fizzle. This problem was solved by the use of explosive lenses which would focus the blast waves inside the imploding sphere, akin to the way in which an optical lens focuses light rays.
After D-Day, General Groves ordered a team of scientists to follow eastward-moving victorious Allied troops into Europe to assess the status of the German nuclear program (and to prevent the westward-moving Soviets from gaining any materials or scientific manpower). They concluded that, while Germany had a modest nuclear research program headed by Werner Heisenberg, the government had not made a significant investment in the project, and it had been nowhere near success. Similarly, Japan&#x27;s efforts at developing a nuclear weapon were starved of resources. The Japanese navy lost interest when a committee led by Yoshio Nishina concluded in 1943 that &quot;it would probably be difficult even for the United States to realize the application of atomic power during the war&quot;.

Historians claim to have found a rough schematic showing a Nazi nuclear bomb. In March 1945, a German scientific team was directed by the physicist Kurt Diebner to develop a primitive nuclear device in Ohrdruf, Thuringia. Last ditch research was conducted in an experimental nuclear reactor at Haigerloch.

===Decision to drop the bomb===

On April 12, after Roosevelt&#x27;s death, Vice President Harry S. Truman assumed the presidency. At the time of the unconditional surrender of Germany on May 8, 1945, the Manhattan Project was still months away from producing a working weapon.

Because of the difficulties in making a working plutonium bomb, it was decided that there should be a test of the weapon. On July 16, 1945, in the desert north of Alamogordo, New Mexico, the first nuclear test took place, code-named &quot;Trinity&quot;, using a device nicknamed &quot;the gadget.&quot; The test, a plutonium implosion-type device, released energy equivalent to 22 kilotons of TNT, far more powerful than any weapon ever used before. The news of the test&#x27;s success was rushed to Truman at the Potsdam Conference, where Churchill was briefed and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin was informed of the new weapon. On July 26, the Potsdam Declaration was issued containing an ultimatum for Japan: either surrender or suffer &quot;complete and utter destruction&quot;, although nuclear weapons were not mentioned.
After hearing arguments from scientists and military officers over the possible use of nuclear weapons against Japan (though some recommended using them as demonstrations in unpopulated areas, most recommended using them against built up targets, a euphemistic term for populated cities), Truman ordered the use of the weapons on Japanese cities. Under the clause of the 1943 Quebec Agreement that specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent, the atomic bombing of Japan was recorded as a decision of the Anglo-American Combined Policy Committee.

Truman hoped it would send a strong message that would end in the capitulation of the Japanese leadership and avoid a lengthy invasion of the islands. Truman and his Secretary of State James F. Byrnes were also intent on ending the Pacific war before the Soviets could enter it, given that Roosevelt had promised Stalin control of Manchuria if he joined the invasion. On May 10–11, 1945, the Target Committee at Los Alamos, led by Oppenheimer, recommended Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, and Kokura as possible targets. Concerns about Kyoto&#x27;s cultural heritage led to it being replaced by Nagasaki. In late July and early August 1945, a series of leaflets were dropped over several Japanese cities warning them of an imminent destructive attack (though not mentioning nuclear bombs). Evidence suggests that these leaflets were never dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or were dropped too late, although a testimony does contradict this.
On August 6, 1945, a uranium-based weapon, Little Boy, was detonated above the Japanese city of Hiroshima, and three days later, a plutonium-based weapon, Fat Man, was detonated above the Japanese city of Nagasaki. To date, Hiroshima and Nagasaki remain the only two instances of nuclear weapons being used in combat. The atomic raids killed at least one hundred thousand Japanese civilians and military personnel outright, with the heat, radiation, and blast effects. Many tens of thousands would later die of radiation sickness and related cancers. Truman promised a &quot;rain of ruin&quot; if Japan did not surrender immediately, threatening to systematically eliminate their ability to wage war. On August 15, Emperor Hirohito announced Japan&#x27;s surrender.

==Soviet atomic bomb project==
The Soviet Union was not invited to share in the new weapons developed by the United States and the other Allies. During the war, information had been pouring in from a number of volunteer spies involved with the Manhattan Project (known in Soviet cables under the code-name of &quot;Enormoz&quot;), and the Soviet nuclear physicist Igor Kurchatov was carefully watching the Allied weapons development. It came as no surprise to Stalin when Truman had informed him at the Potsdam conference that he had a &quot;powerful new weapon.&quot; Truman was shocked at Stalin&#x27;s lack of interest. Stalin was nonetheless outraged by the situation, more by the Americans&#x27; guarded monopoly of the bomb than the weapon itself. Some historians share the assessment that Truman immediately authorized nuclear weapons as a &quot;negotiating tool&quot; in the early Cold War. In alarm at this monopoly, the Soviets urgently undertook their own atomic program.

The Soviet spies in the U.S. project were all volunteers and none were Soviet citizens. One of the most valuable, Klaus Fuchs, was a German émigré theoretical physicist who had been part of the early British nuclear efforts and the UK mission to Los Alamos. Fuchs had been intimately involved in the development of the implosion weapon and passed on detailed cross-sections of the Trinity device to his Soviet contacts. Other Los Alamos spies—none of whom knew each other—included Theodore Hall and David Greenglass. The information was kept but not acted upon, as the Soviet Union was still too busy fighting the war in Europe to devote resources to this new project.

In the years immediately after World War II, the issue of who should control atomic weapons became a major international point of contention. Many of the Los Alamos scientists who had built the bomb began to call for &quot;international control of atomic energy,&quot; often calling for either control by transnational organizations or the purposeful distribution of weapons information to all superpowers, but due to a deep distrust of the intentions of the Soviet Union, both in postwar Europe and in general, the policymakers of the United States worked to maintain the American nuclear monopoly.

A half-hearted plan for international control was proposed at the newly formed United Nations by Bernard Baruch (The Baruch Plan), but it was clear both to American commentators—and to the Soviets—that it was an attempt primarily to stymie Soviet nuclear efforts. The Soviets vetoed the plan, effectively ending any immediate postwar negotiations on atomic energy, and made overtures towards banning the use of atomic weapons in general.

The Soviets had put their full industrial might and manpower into the development of their own atomic weapons. The initial problem for the Soviets was primarily one of resources—they had not scouted out uranium resources in the Soviet Union and the U.S. had made deals to monopolise the largest known (and high purity) reserves in the Belgian Congo. The USSR used penal labour to mine the old deposits in Czechoslovakia—now an area under their control—and searched for other domestic deposits (which were eventually found).

Two days after the bombing of Nagasaki, the U.S. government released an official technical history of the Manhattan Project, authored by Princeton physicist Henry DeWolf Smyth, known colloquially as the Smyth Report. The sanitized summary of the wartime effort focused primarily on the production facilities and scale of investment, written in part to justify the wartime expenditure to the American public.

The Soviet program, under the suspicious watch of former NKVD chief Lavrenty Beria (a participant and victor in Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge of the 1930s), would use the Report as a blueprint, seeking to duplicate as much as possible the American effort. The &quot;secret cities&quot; used for the Soviet equivalents of Hanford and Oak Ridge literally vanished from the maps for decades to come.

At the Soviet equivalent of Los Alamos, Arzamas-16, physicist Yuli Khariton led the scientific effort to develop the weapon. Beria distrusted his scientists, however, and he distrusted the carefully collected espionage information. As such, Beria assigned multiple teams of scientists to the same task without informing each team of the other&#x27;s existence. If they arrived at different conclusions, Beria would bring them together for the first time and have them debate with their newfound counterparts. Beria used the espionage information as a way to double-check the progress of his scientists, and in his effort for duplication of the American project even rejected more efficient bomb designs in favor of ones that more closely mimicked the tried-and-true Fat Man bomb used by the U.S. against Nagasaki.

On August 29, 1949, the effort brought its results, when the USSR successfully tested its first fission bomb, dubbed &quot;Joe-1&quot; by the U.S. The news of the first Soviet bomb was announced to the world first by the United States, which had detected atmospheric radioactive traces generated from its test site in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic.

The loss of the American monopoly on nuclear weapons marked the first tit-for-tat of the nuclear arms race.

==American developments after World War II==
With the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the U.S. Congress established the civilian Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to take over the development of nuclear weapons from the military, and to develop nuclear power. The AEC made use of many private companies in processing uranium and thorium and in other urgent tasks related to the development of bombs. Many of these companies had very lax safety measures and employees were sometimes exposed to radiation levels far above what was allowed then or now. (In 1974, the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) of the Army Corps of Engineers was set up to deal with contaminated sites left over from these operations.)

The Atomic Energy Act also established the United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, which had broad legislative and executive oversight jurisdiction over nuclear matters and became one of the powerful congressional committees in U.S. history. Its two early chairmen, Senator Brien McMahon and Senator Bourke Hickenlooper, both pushed for increased production of nuclear materials and a resultant increase in the American atomic stockpile. The size of that stockpile, which had been low in the immediate postwar years, was a closely guarded secret. Indeed, within the U.S. government, including the Departments of State and Defense, there was considerable confusion over who actually knew the size of the stockpile, and some people chose not to know for fear they might disclose the number accidentally.

==The first thermonuclear weapons==


The notion of using a fission weapon to ignite a process of nuclear fusion can be dated back to September 1941, when it was first proposed by Enrico Fermi to his colleague Edward Teller during a discussion at Columbia University. At the first major theoretical conference on the development of an atomic bomb hosted by J. Robert Oppenheimer at the University of California, Berkeley in the summer of 1942, Teller directed the majority of the discussion towards this idea of a &quot;Super&quot; bomb.

It was thought at the time that a fission weapon would be quite simple to develop and that perhaps work on a hydrogen bomb (thermonuclear weapon) would be possible to complete before the end of the Second World War. However, in reality the problem of a regular atomic bomb was large enough to preoccupy the scientists for the next few years, much less the more speculative &quot;Super&quot; bomb. Only Teller continued working on the project—against the will of project leaders Oppenheimer and Hans Bethe.

The Joe-1 atomic bomb test by the Soviet Union that took place in August 1949 came earlier than expected by Americans, and over the next several months there was an intense debate within the U.S. government, military, and scientific communities regarding whether to proceed with development of the far more powerful Super.

After the atomic bombings of Japan, many scientists at Los Alamos rebelled against the notion of creating a weapon thousands of times more powerful than the first atomic bombs. For the scientists the question was in part technical—the weapon design was still quite uncertain and unworkable—and in part moral: such a weapon, they argued, could only be used against large civilian populations, and could thus only be used as a weapon of genocide.

Many scientists, such as Bethe, urged that the United States should not develop such weapons and set an example towards the Soviet Union. Promoters of the weapon, including Teller, Ernest Lawrence, and Luis Alvarez, argued that such a development was inevitable, and to deny such protection to the people of the United States—especially when the Soviet Union was likely to create such a weapon themselves—was itself an immoral and unwise act.

Oppenheimer, who was now head of the General Advisory Committee of the successor to the Manhattan Project, the Atomic Energy Commission, presided over a recommendation against the development of the weapon. The reasons were in part because the success of the technology seemed limited at the time (and not worth the investment of resources to confirm whether this was so), and because Oppenheimer believed that the atomic forces of the United States would be more effective if they consisted of many large fission weapons (of which multiple bombs could be dropped on the same targets) rather than the large and unwieldy super bombs, for which there was a relatively limited number of targets of sufficient size to warrant such a development.

What is more, if such weapons were developed by both superpowers, they would be more effective against the U.S. than against the USSR, as the U.S. had far more regions of dense industrial and civilian activity as targets for large weapons than the Soviet Union.

In the end, President Truman made the final decision, looking for a proper response to the first Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949. On January 31, 1950, Truman announced a crash program to develop the hydrogen (fusion) bomb. The exact mechanism was still not known: the classical hydrogen bomb, whereby the &quot;heat&quot; of the fission bomb would be used to ignite the fusion material, seemed highly unworkable. An insight by Los Alamos mathematician Stanislaw Ulam showed that the fission bomb and the fusion fuel could be in separate parts of the bomb, and that radiation of the fission could compress the fusion material before igniting it.

Teller pushed the notion further and used the results of the boosted-fission &quot;George&quot; test (a boosted-fission device using a small amount of fusion fuel to boost the yield of a fission bomb) to confirm the fusion of heavy hydrogen elements before preparing for their first true multi-stage, Teller-Ulam hydrogen bomb test. Many scientists, initially against the weapon, such as Oppenheimer and Bethe, changed their previous opinions, seeing the development as being unstoppable.

The first fusion bomb was tested by the United States in &quot;Operation Ivy&quot; on November 1, 1952, on Elugelab Island in the Enewetak (or Eniwetok) Atoll of the Marshall Islands, code-named &quot;Mike.&quot; Mike used liquid deuterium as its fusion fuel and a large fission weapon as its trigger. The device was a prototype design and not a deliverable weapon: standing over 20 ft (6 m) high and weighing at least 140,000 lb (64 t) (its refrigeration equipment added an additional as well), it could not have been dropped from even the largest planes.

Its explosion yielded energy equivalent to 10.4 megatons of TNT—over 450 times the power of the bomb dropped onto Nagasaki— and obliterated Elugelab, leaving an underwater crater 6240 ft (1.9 km) wide and 164 ft (50 m) deep where the island had once been. Truman had initially tried to create a media blackout about the test—hoping it would not become an issue in the upcoming presidential election—but on January 7, 1953, Truman announced the development of the hydrogen bomb to the world as hints and speculations of it were already beginning to emerge in the press.

Not to be outdone, the Soviet Union exploded its first thermonuclear device, designed by the physicist Andrei Sakharov, on August 12, 1953, labeled &quot;Joe-4&quot; by the West. This created concern within the U.S. government and military, because, unlike Mike, the Soviet device was a deliverable weapon, which the U.S. did not yet have. This first device though was arguably not a true hydrogen bomb and could only reach explosive yields in the hundreds of kilotons (never reaching the megaton range of a staged weapon). Still, it was a powerful propaganda tool for the Soviet Union, and the technical differences were fairly oblique to the American public and politicians.

Following the Mike blast by less than a year, Joe-4 seemed to validate claims that the bombs were inevitable and vindicate those who had supported the development of the fusion program. Coming during the height of McCarthyism, the effect was pronounced on the security hearings in early 1954, which revoked former Los Alamos director Robert Oppenheimer&#x27;s security clearance on the grounds that he was unreliable, had not supported the American hydrogen bomb program, and had made long-standing left-wing ties in the 1930s. Edward Teller participated in the hearing as the only major scientist to testify against Oppenheimer, resulting in his virtual expulsion from the physics community.

On March 1, 1954, the U.S. detonated its first practical thermonuclear weapon (which used isotopes of lithium as its fusion fuel), known as the &quot;Shrimp&quot; device of the Castle Bravo test, at Bikini Atoll, Marshall Islands. The device yielded 15 megatons, more than twice its expected yield, and became the worst radiological disaster in U.S. history. The combination of the unexpectedly large blast and poor weather conditions caused a cloud of radioactive nuclear fallout to contaminate over . 239 Marshall Island natives and 28 Americans were exposed to significant amounts of radiation, resulting in elevated levels of cancer and birth defects in the years to come.

The crew of the Japanese tuna-fishing boat &quot;Lucky Dragon 5&quot;, who had been fishing just outside the exclusion zone, returned to port suffering from radiation sickness and skin burns; one crew member was terminally ill. Efforts were made to recover the cargo of contaminated fish but at least two large tuna were probably sold and eaten. A further 75 tons of tuna caught between March and December were found to be unfit for human consumption. When the crew member died and the full results of the contamination were made public by the U.S., Japanese concerns were reignited about the hazards of radiation.

The hydrogen bomb age had a profound effect on the thoughts of nuclear war in the popular and military mind. With only fission bombs, nuclear war was something that possibly could be limited. Dropped by planes and only able to destroy the most built up areas of major cities, it was possible for many to look at fission bombs as a technological extension of large-scale conventional bombing—such as the extensive firebombing of German and Japanese cities during World War II. Proponents brushed aside as grave exaggeration claims that such weapons could lead to worldwide death or harm.

Even in the decades before fission weapons, there had been speculation about the possibility for human beings to end all life on the planet, either by accident or purposeful maliciousness—but technology had not provided the capacity for such action. The great power of hydrogen bombs made worldwide annihilation possible.

The Castle Bravo incident itself raised a number of questions about the survivability of a nuclear war. Government scientists in both the U.S. and the USSR had insisted that fusion weapons, unlike fission weapons, were cleaner, as fusion reactions did not produce the dangerously radioactive by-products of fission reactions. While technically true, this hid a more gruesome point: the last stage of a multi-staged hydrogen bomb often used the neutrons produced by the fusion reactions to induce fissioning in a jacket of natural uranium and provided around half of the yield of the device itself.

This fission stage made fusion weapons considerably dirtier than they were made out to be. This was evident in the towering cloud of deadly fallout that followed the &quot;Bravo&quot; test. When the Soviet Union tested its first megaton device in 1955, the possibility of a &quot;limited&quot; nuclear war seemed even more remote in the public and political mind. Even cities and countries that were not direct targets would suffer fallout contamination. Extremely harmful fission products would disperse via normal weather patterns and embed in soil and water around the planet.

Speculation began to run towards what fallout and dust from a full-scale nuclear exchange would do to the world as a whole, rather than just cities and countries directly involved. In this way, the fate of the world was now tied to the fate of the bomb-wielding superpowers.

==Deterrence and brinkmanship==

Throughout the 1950s and the early 1960s the U.S. and the USSR both endeavored, in a tit-for-tat approach, to prevent the other power from acquiring nuclear supremacy. This had massive political and cultural effects during the Cold War.
As one instance of this mindset, in the early 1950s it was proposed to drop a nuclear bomb on the Moon as a globally visible demonstration of American weaponry.

The first atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, were large, custom-made devices, requiring highly trained personnel for their arming and deployment. They could be dropped only from the largest bomber planes—at the time the B-29 Superfortress—and each plane could only carry a single bomb in its hold. The first hydrogen bombs were similarly massive and complicated. This ratio of one plane to one bomb was still fairly impressive in comparison with conventional, non-nuclear weapons, but against other nuclear-armed countries it was considered a grave danger.

In the immediate postwar years, the U.S. expended much effort on making the bombs &quot;G.I.-proof&quot;—capable of being used and deployed by members of the U.S. Army, rather than Nobel Prize–winning scientists. In the 1950s, the U.S. undertook a nuclear testing program to improve the nuclear arsenal.

Starting in 1951, the Nevada Test Site (in the Nevada desert) became the primary location for all U.S. nuclear testing (in the USSR, Semipalatinsk Test Site in Kazakhstan served a similar role). Tests were divided into two primary categories: &quot;weapons related&quot; (verifying that a new weapon worked or looking at exactly how it worked) and &quot;weapons effects.&quot; A detailed study about the effects of nuclear weapons can be read from S. Glasstone and P.J. Dolan. 

In the beginning, almost all nuclear tests were either atmospheric (conducted above ground, in the atmosphere) or underwater (such as some of the tests done in the Marshall Islands). Testing was used as a sign of both national and technological strength, but also raised questions about the safety of the tests, which released nuclear fallout into the atmosphere (most dramatically with the Castle Bravo test in 1954, but in more limited amounts with almost all atmospheric nuclear testing).

Because testing was seen as a sign of technological development (the ability to design usable weapons without some form of testing was considered dubious), halts on testing were often called for as stand-ins for halts in the nuclear arms race itself, and many prominent scientists and statesmen lobbied for a ban on nuclear testing. In 1958, the U.S., USSR, and the United Kingdom (a new nuclear power) declared a temporary testing moratorium for both political and health reasons, but by 1961 the Soviet Union had broken the moratorium and both the USSR, and the U.S. began testing with great frequency.

As a show of political strength, the Soviet Union tested the largest-ever nuclear weapon in October 1961, the massive Tsar Bomba, which was tested in a reduced state with a yield of around 50 megatons—in its full state it was estimated to have been around 100 Mt. The weapon was largely impractical for actual military use but was hot enough to induce third-degree burns at a distance of 62 mi (100 km) away. In its full, dirty, design it would have increased the amount of worldwide fallout since 1945 by 25%.

In 1963, all nuclear and many non-nuclear states signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, pledging to refrain from testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space. The treaty permitted underground tests.

Most tests were considerably more modest and worked for direct technical purposes as well as their potential political overtones. Weapons improvements took on two primary forms. One was an increase in efficiency and power, and within only a few years fission bombs were developed that were many times more powerful than the ones created during World War II. The other was a program of miniaturization, reducing the size of the nuclear weapons.

Smaller bombs meant that bombers could carry more of them, and also that they could be carried on the new generation of rockets in development in the 1950s and 1960s. U.S. rocket science received a large boost in the postwar years, largely with the help of engineers acquired from the Nazi rocketry program. These included scientists such as Wernher von Braun, who had helped design the V-2 rockets the Nazis launched across the English Channel. An American program, Project Paperclip, had endeavored to move German scientists into American hands (and away from Soviet hands) and put them to work for the U.S.

==Weapons improvement==
Early nuclear armed rockets—such as the MGR-1 Honest John, first deployed by the U.S. in 1953—were surface-to-surface missiles with relatively short ranges (around 15 mi/25 km maximum) and yields around twice the size of the first fission weapons. The limited range meant they could only be used in certain types of military situations. U.S. rockets could not, for example, threaten Moscow with an immediate strike, and could only be used as tactical weapons (that is, for small-scale military situations).

Strategic weapons—weapons that could threaten an entire country—relied, for the time being, on long-range bombers that could penetrate deep into enemy territory. In the U.S., this requirement led, in 1946, to creation of the Strategic Air Command—a system of bombers headed by General Curtis LeMay (who previously presided over the firebombing of Japan during WWII). In operations like Chrome Dome, SAC kept nuclear-armed planes in the air 24 hours a day, ready for an order to attack Moscow.

These technological possibilities enabled nuclear strategy to develop a logic considerably different from previous military thinking. Because the threat of nuclear warfare was so awful, it was first thought that it might make any war of the future impossible. President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;massive retaliation&quot; in the early years of the Cold War was a message to the USSR, saying that if the Red Army attempted to invade the parts of Europe not given to the Eastern bloc during the Potsdam Conference (such as West Germany), nuclear weapons would be used against the Soviet troops and potentially the Soviet leaders.
With the development of more rapid-response technologies (such as rockets and long-range bombers), this policy began to shift. If the Soviet Union also had nuclear weapons and a policy of &quot;massive retaliation&quot; was carried out, it was reasoned, then any Soviet forces not killed in the initial attack, or launched while the attack was ongoing, would be able to serve their own form of nuclear retaliation against the U.S. Recognizing that this was an undesirable outcome, military officers and game theorists at the RAND think tank developed a nuclear warfare strategy that was eventually called Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD).

MAD divided potential nuclear war into two stages: &quot;first strike&quot; and &quot;second strike&quot;. First strike meant the first use of nuclear weapons by one nuclear-equipped nation against another nuclear-equipped nation. If the attacking nation did not prevent the attacked nation from a nuclear response, the attacked nation would respond with a second strike against the attacking nation. In this situation, whether the U.S. first attacked the USSR, or the USSR first attacked the U.S., the result would be that both nations would be damaged to the point of utter social collapse.

According to game theory, because starting a nuclear war was suicidal, no logical country would shoot first. However, if a country could launch a first strike that utterly destroyed the target country&#x27;s ability to respond, that might give that country the confidence to initiate a nuclear war. The object of a country operating by the MAD doctrine is to deny the opposing country this first strike capability.

MAD played on two seemingly opposed modes of thought: cold logic and emotional fear. The English phrase MAD was often known by, &quot;nuclear deterrence,&quot; was translated by the French as &quot;dissuasion,&quot; and &quot;terrorization&quot; by the Soviets. This apparent paradox of nuclear war was summed up by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill as &quot;the worse things get, the better they are&quot;—the greater the threat of mutual destruction, the safer the world would be.
This philosophy made a number of technological and political demands on participating nations. For one thing, it said that it should always be assumed that an enemy nation may be trying to acquire first strike capability, which must always be avoided. In American politics this translated into demands to avoid &quot;bomber gaps&quot; and &quot;missile gaps&quot; where the Soviet Union could potentially outshoot the Americans. It also encouraged the production of thousands of nuclear weapons by both the U.S. and the USSR, far more than needed to simply destroy the major civilian and military infrastructures of the opposing country. These policies and strategies were satirized in the 1964 Stanley Kubrick film Dr. Strangelove, in which the Soviets, unable to keep up with the US&#x27;s first strike capability, instead plan for MAD by building a Doomsday Machine, and thus, after a (literally) mad US General orders a nuclear attack on the USSR, the end of the world is brought about.

The policy also encouraged the development of the first early warning systems. Conventional war, even at its fastest, was fought over days and weeks. With long-range bombers, from the start of a nuclear attack to its conclusion was mere hours. Rockets could reduce a conflict to minutes. Planners reasoned that conventional command and control systems could not adequately react to a nuclear attack, so great lengths were taken to develop computer systems that could look for enemy attacks and direct rapid responses.

The U.S. poured massive funding into development of SAGE, a system that could track and intercept enemy bomber aircraft using information from remote radar stations. It was the first computer system to feature real-time processing, multiplexing, and display devices. It was the first general computing machine, and a direct predecessor of modern computers.

==Emergence of the anti-nuclear movement==

The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the end of World War II quickly followed the 1945 Trinity nuclear test, and the Little Boy device was detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945. Exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500 tonnes of TNT, the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings and killed approximately 75,000 people. Subsequently, the world&#x27;s nuclear weapons stockpiles grew.

Operation Crossroads was a series of nuclear weapon tests conducted by the United States at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean in the summer of 1946. Its purpose was to test the effect of nuclear weapons on naval ships. To prepare the Bikini atoll for the nuclear tests, Bikini&#x27;s native residents were evicted from their homes and resettled on smaller, uninhabited islands where they were unable to sustain themselves.

National leaders debated the impact of nuclear weapons on domestic and foreign policy. Also involved in the debate about nuclear weapons policy was the scientific community, through professional associations such as the Federation of Atomic Scientists and the Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs. Radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing was first drawn to public attention in 1954 when a Hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific contaminated the crew of the Japanese fishing boat &quot;Lucky Dragon&quot;. One of the fishermen died in Japan seven months later. The incident caused widespread concern around the world and &quot;provided a decisive impetus for the emergence of the anti-nuclear weapons movement in many countries&quot;. The anti-nuclear weapons movement grew rapidly because for many people the atomic bomb &quot;encapsulated the very worst direction in which society was moving&quot;.

Peace movements emerged in Japan and in 1954 they converged to form a unified &quot;Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs&quot;. Japanese opposition to the Pacific nuclear weapons tests was widespread, and &quot;an estimated 35 million signatures were collected on petitions calling for bans on nuclear weapons&quot;. The Russell–Einstein Manifesto was issued in London on July 9, 1955, by Bertrand Russell in the midst of the Cold War. It highlighted the dangers posed by nuclear weapons and called for world leaders to seek peaceful resolutions to international conflict. The signatories included eleven pre-eminent intellectuals and scientists, including Albert Einstein, who signed it just days before his death on April 18, 1955. A few days after the release, philanthropist Cyrus S. Eaton offered to sponsor a conference—called for in the manifesto—in Pugwash, Nova Scotia, Eaton&#x27;s birthplace. This conference was to be the first of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, held in July 1957.

In the United Kingdom, the first Aldermaston March organised by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament took place at Easter 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from Trafalgar Square, London, to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment close to Aldermaston in Berkshire, England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons. The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches.

In 1959, a letter in the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; was the start of a successful campaign to stop the Atomic Energy Commission dumping radioactive waste in the sea 19 kilometres from Boston. On November 1, 1961, at the height of the Cold War, about 50,000 women brought together by Women Strike for Peace marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against nuclear weapons. It was the largest national women&#x27;s peace protest of the 20th century.

In 1958, Linus Pauling and his wife presented the United Nations with the petition signed by more than 11,000 scientists calling for an end to nuclear-weapon testing. The &quot;Baby Tooth Survey,&quot; headed by Dr Louise Reiss, demonstrated conclusively in 1961 that above-ground nuclear testing posed significant public health risks in the form of radioactive fallout spread primarily via milk from cows that had ingested contaminated grass. Public pressure and the research results subsequently led to a moratorium on above-ground nuclear weapons testing, followed by the Partial Test Ban Treaty, signed in 1963 by John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev.

==Cuban Missile Crisis==


Bombers and short-range rockets were not reliable: planes could be shot down, and earlier nuclear missiles could cover only a limited range— for example, the first Soviet rockets&#x27; range limited them to targets in Europe. However, by the 1960s, both the United States and the Soviet Union had developed intercontinental ballistic missiles, which could be launched from extremely remote areas far away from their target. They had also developed submarine-launched ballistic missiles, which had less range but could be launched from submarines very close to the target without any radar warning. This made any national protection from nuclear missiles increasingly impractical.

The military realities made for a precarious diplomatic situation. The international politics of brinkmanship led leaders to exclaim their willingness to participate in a nuclear war rather than concede any advantage to their opponents, feeding public fears that their generation may be the last. Civil defense programs undertaken by both superpowers, exemplified by the construction of fallout shelters and urging civilians about the survivability of nuclear war, did little to ease public concerns.

The climax of brinksmanship came in early 1962, when an American U-2 spy plane photographed a series of launch sites for medium-range ballistic missiles being constructed on the island of Cuba, just off the coast of the southern United States, beginning what became known as the Cuban Missile Crisis. The U.S. administration of John F. Kennedy concluded that the Soviet Union, then led by Nikita Khrushchev, was planning to station Soviet nuclear missiles on the island (as a response to placing US Jupiter MRBMs in Italy and Turkey), which was under the control of communist Fidel Castro. On October 22, Kennedy announced the discoveries in a televised address. He announced a naval blockade around Cuba that would turn back Soviet nuclear shipments and warned that the military was prepared &quot;for any eventualities.&quot; The missiles had 2,400 mile (4,000 km) range and would allow the Soviet Union to quickly destroy many major American cities on the Eastern Seaboard if a nuclear war began.

The leaders of the two superpowers stood nose to nose, seemingly poised over the beginnings of a third world war. Khrushchev&#x27;s ambitions for putting the weapons on the island were motivated in part by the fact that the U.S. had stationed similar weapons in Britain, Italy, and nearby Turkey, and had previously attempted to sponsor an invasion of Cuba the year before in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. On October 26, Khrushchev sent a message to Kennedy offering to withdraw all missiles if Kennedy committed to a policy of no future invasions of Cuba. Khrushchev worded the threat of assured destruction eloquently:
You and I should not now pull on the ends of the rope in which you have tied a knot of war, because the harder you and I pull, the tighter the knot will become. And a time may come when this knot is tied so tight that the person who tied it is no longer capable of untying it, and then the knot will have to be cut. What that would mean I need not explain to you, because you yourself understand perfectly what dreaded forces our two countries possess.

A day later, however, the Soviets sent another message, this time demanding that the U.S. remove its missiles from Turkey before any missiles were withdrawn from Cuba. On the same day, a U-2 plane was shot down over Cuba and another almost intercepted over the Soviet Union, as Soviet merchant ships neared the quarantine zone. Kennedy responded by accepting the first deal publicly and sending his brother Robert to the Soviet embassy to accept the second deal privately. On October 28, the Soviet ships stopped at the quarantine line and, after some hesitation, turned back towards the Soviet Union. Khrushchev announced that he had ordered the removal of all missiles in Cuba, and U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk was moved to comment, &quot;We went eyeball to eyeball, and the other fellow just blinked.&quot;

The Crisis was later seen as the closest the U.S. and the USSR ever came to nuclear war and had been narrowly averted by last-minute compromise by both superpowers. Fears of communication difficulties led to the installment of the first hotline, a direct link between the superpowers that allowed them to more easily discuss future military activities and political maneuverings. It had been made clear that missiles, bombers, submarines, and computerized firing systems made escalating any situation to Armageddon far easier than anybody desired.

After stepping so close to the brink, both the U.S. and the USSR worked to reduce their nuclear tensions in the years immediately following. The most immediate culmination of this work was the signing of the Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963, in which the U.S. and USSR agreed to no longer test nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space. Testing underground continued, allowing for further weapons development, but the worldwide fallout risks were purposefully reduced, and the era of using massive nuclear tests as a form of saber rattling ended.

In December 1979, NATO decided to deploy cruise and Pershing II missiles in Western Europe in response to Soviet deployment of intermediate range mobile missiles, and in the early 1980s, a &quot;dangerous Soviet-US nuclear confrontation&quot; arose. In New York on June 12, 1982, one million people gathered to protest about nuclear weapons, and to support the second UN Special Session on Disarmament. As the nuclear abolitionist movement grew, there were many protests at the Nevada Test Site. For example, on February 6, 1987, nearly 2,000 demonstrators, including six members of Congress, protested against nuclear weapons testing and more than 400 people were arrested. Four of the significant groups organizing this renewal of anti-nuclear activism were Greenpeace, The American Peace Test, The Western Shoshone, and Nevada Desert Experience.

There have been at least four major false alarms, the most recent in 1995, that resulted in the activation of nuclear attack early warning protocols. They include the accidental loading of a training tape into the American early-warning computers; a computer chip failure that appeared to show a random number of attacking missiles; a rare alignment of the Sun, the U.S. missile fields and a Soviet early warning satellite that caused it to confuse high-altitude clouds with missile launches; the launch of a Norwegian research rocket resulted in President Yeltsin activating his nuclear briefcase for the first time.

==Initial proliferation==

In the fifties and sixties, three more countries joined the &quot;nuclear club.&quot; The United Kingdom had been an integral part of the Manhattan Project following the Quebec Agreement in 1943. The passing of the McMahon Act by the United States in 1946 unilaterally broke this partnership and prevented the passage of any further information to the United Kingdom. The British Government, under Clement Attlee, determined that a British Bomb was essential. Because of British involvement in the Manhattan Project, Britain had extensive knowledge in some areas, but not in others.

An improved version of &#x27;Fat Man&#x27; was developed, and on 26 February 1952, Prime Minister Winston Churchill announced that the United Kingdom had an atomic bomb and a successful test took place on 3 October 1952. At first these were free-fall bombs, intended for use by the V Force of jet bombers. A Vickers Valiant dropped the first UK nuclear weapon on 11 October 1956 at Maralinga, South Australia. Later came a missile, Blue Steel, intended for carriage by the V Force bombers, and then the Blue Streak medium-range ballistic missile (later canceled). Anglo-American cooperation on nuclear weapons was restored by the 1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement. As a result of this and the Polaris Sales Agreement, the United Kingdom has bought United States designs for submarine missiles and fitted its own warheads. It retains full independent control over the use of the missiles. It no longer possesses any free-fall bombs.

France had been heavily involved in nuclear research before World War II through the work of the Joliot-Curies. This was discontinued after the war because of the instability of the Fourth Republic and lack of finances. However, in the 1950s, France launched a civil nuclear research program, which produced plutonium as a byproduct.

In 1956, France formed a secret Committee for the Military Applications of Atomic Energy and a development program for delivery vehicles. With the return of Charles de Gaulle to the French presidency in 1958, final decisions to build a bomb were made, which led to a successful test in 1960. Since then, France has developed and maintained its own nuclear deterrent independent of NATO.

In 1951, China and the Soviet Union signed an agreement whereby China supplied uranium ore in exchange for technical assistance in producing nuclear weapons. In 1953, China established a research program under the guise of civilian nuclear energy. Throughout the 1950s the Soviet Union provided large amounts of equipment. But as the relations between the two countries worsened the Soviets reduced the amount of assistance and, in 1959, refused to donate a bomb for copying purposes. Despite this, the Chinese made rapid progress. Chinese first gained possession of nuclear weapons in 1964, making it the fifth country to have them. It tested its first atomic bomb at Lop Nur on October 16, 1964 (Project 596); and tested a nuclear missile on October 25, 1966; and tested a thermonuclear (hydrogen) bomb (Test No. 6) on June 14, 1967. China ultimately conducted a total of 45 nuclear tests; although the country has never become a signatory to the Limited Test Ban Treaty, it conducted its last nuclear test in 1996. In the 1980s, China&#x27;s nuclear weapons program was a source of nuclear proliferation, as China transferred its CHIC-4 technology to Pakistan. China became a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as a nuclear weapon state in 1992, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) in 2004. As of 2017, the number of Chinese warheads is thought to be in the low hundreds, The Atomic Heritage Foundation notes a 2018 estimate of approximately 260 nuclear warheads, including between 50 and 60 ICBMs and four nuclear submarines. China declared a policy of &quot;no first use&quot; in 1964, the only nuclear weapons state to announce such a policy; this declaration has no effect on its capabilities and there are no diplomatic means of verifying or enforcing this declaration.

==Cold War==

After World War II, the balance of power between the Eastern and Western blocs and the fear of global destruction prevented the further military use of atomic bombs. This fear was even a central part of Cold War strategy, referred to as the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction. So important was this balance to international political stability that a treaty, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (or ABM treaty), was signed by the U.S. and the USSR in 1972 to curtail the development of defenses against nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles that carry them. This doctrine resulted in a large increase in the number of nuclear weapons, as each side sought to ensure it possessed the firepower to destroy the opposition in all possible scenarios.

Early delivery systems for nuclear devices were primarily bombers like the United States B-29 Superfortress and Convair B-36, and later the B-52 Stratofortress. Ballistic missile systems, based on Wernher von Braun&#x27;s World War II designs (specifically the V-2 rocket), were developed by both United States and Soviet Union teams (in the case of the U.S., effort was directed by the German scientists and engineers although the Soviet Union also made extensive use of captured German scientists, engineers, and technical data).

These systems were used to launch satellites, such as Sputnik, and to propel the Space Race, but they were primarily developed to create Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) that could deliver nuclear weapons anywhere on the globe. Development of these systems continued throughout the Cold War—though plans and treaties, beginning with the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT I), restricted deployment of these systems until, after the fall of the Soviet Union, system development essentially halted, and many weapons were disabled and destroyed. On January 27, 1967, more than 60 nations signed the Outer Space Treaty, banning nuclear weapons in space.

There have been a number of potential nuclear disasters. Following air accidents U.S. nuclear weapons have been lost near Atlantic City, New Jersey (1957); Savannah, Georgia (1958) (see Tybee Bomb); Goldsboro, North Carolina (1961); off the coast of Okinawa (1965); in the sea near Palomares, Spain (1966) (see 1966 Palomares B-52 crash); and near Thule, Greenland (1968) (see 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash). Most of the lost weapons were recovered, the Spanish device after three months&#x27; effort by the DSV Alvin and DSV Aluminaut. Investigative journalist Eric Schlosser discovered that at least 700 &quot;significant&quot; accidents and incidents involving 1,250 nuclear weapons were recorded in the United States between 1950 and 1968.

The Soviet Union was less forthcoming about such incidents, but the environmental group Greenpeace believes that there are around forty non-U.S. nuclear devices that have been lost and not recovered, compared to eleven lost by America, mostly in submarine disasters. The U.S. has tried to recover Soviet devices, notably in the 1974 Project Azorian using the specialist salvage vessel &quot;Hughes Glomar Explorer&quot; to raise a Soviet submarine. After news leaked out about this boondoggle, the CIA would coin a favorite phrase for refusing to disclose sensitive information, called glomarization: &quot;We can neither confirm nor deny the existence of the information requested but, hypothetically, if such data were to exist, the subject matter would be classified, and could not be disclosed.&quot;

The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 essentially ended the Cold War. However, the end of the Cold War failed to end the threat of nuclear weapon use, although global fears of nuclear war reduced substantially. In a major move of symbolic de-escalation, Boris Yeltsin, on January 26, 1992, announced that Russia planned to stop targeting United States cities with nuclear weapons.

==Cost==
The designing, testing, producing, deploying, and defending against nuclear weapons is one of the largest expenditures for the nations which possess nuclear weapons. In the United States during the Cold War years, between &quot;one quarter to one third of all military spending since World War II [was] devoted to nuclear weapons and their infrastructure.&quot;
According to a retrospective Brookings Institution study published in 1998 by the Nuclear Weapons Cost Study Committee (formed in 1993 by the W. Alton Jones Foundation), the total expenditures for U.S. nuclear weapons from 1940 to 1998 was $5.5 trillion in 1996 dollars.

For comparison, the total public debt at the end of fiscal year 1998 was $5,478,189,000,000 in 1998 dollars or $5.3 trillion. The &quot;entire public debt&quot; in 1998 was therefore equal to the cost of research, development, and deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons-related programs during the Cold War.

==Second nuclear age==

The &quot;second nuclear age&quot; can be regarded as proliferation of nuclear weapons among lesser powers and for reasons other than the American-Soviet-Chinese rivalry.

India embarked relatively early on a program aimed at nuclear weapons capability, but apparently accelerated this after the 1962 Sino-Indian War. India&#x27;s first atomic-test explosion was in 1974 with &quot;Smiling Buddha&quot;, which it described as a &quot;peaceful nuclear explosion.&quot;

After the collapse of Eastern Military High Command and the disintegration of Pakistan as a result of the 1971 Winter war, Pakistan&#x27;s Bhutto launched scientific research on nuclear weapons. The Indian test caused Pakistan to spur its programme, and the ISI conducted successful espionage operations in the Netherlands, while also developing the programme indigenously. India tested fission, and perhaps, fusion devices in 1998, and Pakistan successfully tested fission devices that same year, raising concerns they would use nuclear weapons on each other.

All the non-Russian former Soviet bloc countries with nuclear weapons - Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan - transferred their warheads to Russia by 1996.

South Africa had an active program to develop uranium-based nuclear weapons but dismantled its nuclear weapon program in the 1990s. Experts do not believe it actually tested such a weapon, though it later claimed it constructed crude devices that it eventually dismantled. In the late 1970s American spy satellites detected a &quot;brief, intense, double flash of light near the southern tip of Africa.&quot; Known as the Vela incident, it was speculated to have been a South African or possibly Israeli nuclear weapons test, though some feel that it may have been caused by natural events or a detector malfunction.

Israel is widely believed to possess an arsenal of up to several hundred nuclear warheads, but this has never been officially confirmed or denied (though the existence of their Dimona nuclear facility was confirmed by Mordechai Vanunu in 1986). Key US scientists involved in the American bomb program, clandestinely helped the Israelis and thus played an important role in nuclear proliferation, one was Edward Teller.

In January 2004, Dr A. Q. Khan of Pakistan&#x27;s programme confessed to having been a key mover in &quot;proliferation activities&quot;, seen as part of an international proliferation network of materials, knowledge, and machines from Pakistan to Libya, Iran, and North Korea.

North Korea announced in 2003 that it had several nuclear explosives. The first claimed detonation was the 2006 North Korean nuclear test, conducted on October 9, 2006. On May 25, 2009, North Korea continued nuclear testing, violating United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718. A third test was conducted on 13 February 2013, two tests were conducted in 2016 in January and September, followed by test a year later in September 2017.

As part of the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances in 1994, the country of Ukraine surrendered its nuclear arsenal, left over from the USSR, in part on the promise that its borders would remain respected if it did so. In 2022 during the prelude to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin, as he had lightly done in the past, alleged that Ukraine was on the path to receiving nuclear weapons. According to Putin, there was a &quot;real danger&quot; that Western allies could help supply Ukraine, which appeared to be on the path to joining NATO, with nuclear arms. Critics labelled Putin&#x27;s claims as &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; designed to build a case for an invasion of Ukraine.

<text>Treffle Berthlaume (June 13, 1803 – October 22, 1884) was a sculptor. He was born in Havre-St. Pierre, Quebec, Canada, to father Jean-Paul, a carpenter of modest means, and mother Brigitte (&quot;née&quot; de Panne). The youngest of six, and the only boy, Treffle was the only Berthlaume child to receive a formal education at Baie-Comeau High School until the age of 15, whereupon he began training in his father&#x27;s craft.

Perhaps best remembered for his contribution towards church carvings, Berthlaume and acquaintance François Baillairgé (1759–1852) produced the Barbeau Cross, now displayed at the Church of Saint Jean on the Island of Orleans in Quebec. For this, and other achievements, Treffle Berthlaume was commemorated on the Canadian 32-cent stamp in 1984, after his death one hundred years earlier.

<text>The music of the Dominican Republic is primarily influenced by Western European music, with Sub-Saharan African and native Taino influences. The Dominican Republic is mainly known for its merengue and bachata music, both of which are the most famous styles of music in the Dominican Republic, and have been exported and popularized around the world.

==Dominican music==

===Merengue===
Merengue is a musical genre native to the Dominican Republic. It has a moderate to a very fast 2/4 rhythm played on güira (metal scraper) and the double-headed tambora. The accordion is also common. Traditional, accordion-based merengue is usually termed merengue típico and is still played by living accordionists like Francisco Ulloa, Fefita la Grande, El Ciego de Nagua, and Rafaelito Román. More modern merengues incorporate electric instruments and influences from salsa, and rock and roll. Choruses are often sung in a call and response form by two or three back-up singers, or more traditionally, by the musicians playing tambora or güira. Beginning in the 1960s, dancing became a part of the singers&#x27; work with Johnny Ventura&#x27;s Combo Show format, and is now a staple of many of the genre&#x27;s biggest stars. Lyrically, irony and double entendres are common.

Merengue continued to be limited in popularity to the lower classes, especially in the Cibao area, in the early 20th century. Artists like Juan F. García, Juan Espínola and Julio Alberto Hernández tried to move merengue into the mainstream, but failed, largely due to social prejudices. Some success occurred after nationalistic feelings arose among the Cibao elite who resented the U.S. occupation of the country from 1916 to 1924. Legend has it that at this time the faster () was slowed down to accommodate American soldiers who could not dance the difficult steps of the merengue; this mid-tempo version was called pambiche. Major mainstream acceptance started with Rafael Trujillo&#x27;s rise to power in the early 1930s.
Dictator Rafael Trujillo, who seized the presidency of the Dominican Republic in 1930, helped merengue to become a national symbol of the island up until his assassination in 1961. Being that he was of humble origins, he had been barred from elite social clubs. He was therefore resentful of these elite sophisticates and began promoting the Cibao-style merengue, forcing all social classes to participate in the low-class dance. At Trujillo&#x27;s command, virtually all musical groups had to compose merengues praising Trujillo&#x27;s dictatorship, its guidelines and actions of his party. Trujillo even made it mandatory for urban dance bands to include merengue in their repertoire. Piano and brass instruments were also added in merengue-oriented big bands, a trend towards upward mobility popularizing by Luis Alberti&#x27;s group in Santiago de los Caballeros. On the other hand, merengue that continued to use an accordion became known (rather disrespectfully) as (&#x27;ripped parrot&#x27;). It was because of all this that merengue became and still is the Dominican Republic&#x27;s national music and dance.

In the 1960s, a new group of artists (most famously Johnny Ventura) incorporated American R&amp;B and rock and roll influences, along with Cuban salsa music. The instrumentation changed, with accordion replaced with electric guitars or synthesizers, or occasionally sampled, and the saxophone&#x27;s role totally redefined. In spite of the changes, merengue remained the most popular form of music in the Dominican Republic. Ventura, for example, was so adulated that he became a massively popular and influential politician on his return from a time in the United States, and was seen as a national symbol.
The 1980s saw increasing Dominican emigration to Europe and the United States, especially to New York City and Miami. Merengue came with them, bringing images of glitzy pop singers and idols. At the same time, Juan Luis Guerra slowed down the merengue rhythm, and added more lyrical depth and entrenched social commentary. He also incorporated bachata and Western musical influences with albums like 1990&#x27;s critically acclaimed .

===Salves===
Salve is a call-and-response type of singing that uses güira, panderos, palos (see next section) and other African instruments. Salves are highly ceremonial and are used in pilgrimages and at parties dedicated to voodoo saints. Salve is a ritual inspired by religion and music with roots in both African and Hispanic cultures. Salve is related to palo that is played in a lot of the same contexts and rhythm. The name comes from the Salve Regina, a Catholic hymn, and many still sing a sacred, a cappella salve that preserves the medieval modes of old Spanish hymns. The ecstatic salve played at religious parties, however, is all about percussion – featuring large numbers of tambourines playing interlocking rhythms and a melodic drum called the balsie, whose player alters the pitch by applying pressure with his foot. Salve may be played in fewer parts of the country but it is one of the best-known sounds, largely because it is the sound of choice in Villa Mella, a poor suburb of the capital often thought of as the epicenter of Afro-Dominican traditions. The salve group of Enerolisa Nuñez, from Villa Mella, is one of the most widely listened to - thanks to her inclusion in merengue-star Kinito Méndez&#x27;s salve-merengue fusion album A Palo Limpio as well as an excellent recording of her group by the Bayahonda Cultural Foundation.

===Palo===
Palo, also known as &quot;atabales&quot; and &quot;salves&quot;, is a Dominican sacred music that can be found throughout the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies – usually coinciding with saint&#x27;s days – as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the Congo region, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies. Palos are related to Dominican folk Catholicism, which includes a pantheon of deities/saints (here termed &quot;misterios&quot;) much like those found in the Afro-American syncretic religious traditions of Cuba, Brazil, Haiti, Puerto Rico and elsewhere. Palos are usually associated with the lower class, Black and mixed populations. They can be seen in different regions of the island, but with variations.

Palo music is played on long drums called . The word means tree, and therefore all Dominican palo drums are instruments made from hollowed out logs. The head of the drum is made of cowhide and it is attached to the log portion with hoops and pegs in the Eastern region, or with nails in the Southwest. There is a master drum () which is a large, wide drum played with slimmer drums () alongside: two in the East or three elsewhere. Palos are usually played with güiras, which are metal scrapers. They may also be played with maracas, or a little stick used to hit the master drum, called the . The Dominican region in which the palos are played determines the form, the number of the instruments, and how they are played.

Palos are associated with the Dominican brotherhoods called . Originally, the brotherhoods were composed solely of men. As time progressed, women and other family members maintained the brotherhoods and their heritage. Each brotherhood is devoted to a particular saint. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the brotherhood to honor the saint with a festival. Historically, were established on principles similar to those of the Mediterranean guild-based societies and those founded by Africans that inhabited southern Spain. Through colonization and the slave trade, these traditions were brought to the Dominican Republic. However, the are not limited to the Dominican Republic. They are found in other parts of the Americas as well, where they may be adapted to Native-American folk Catholicism, particularly in Mexico and Central America.

Palo music is generally played at festivals honoring saints () or during other religious events, such as funerals. The configuration of instruments present depends on the region in which these events take place. Palo drums are played with the hands, held between the legs, and tied to the &#x27;s waist by a rope. The three paleros each play a distinct beat on their palos, which ultimately blend together. These rhythms vary depending on the region as well. For example, in the East, the rhythm is popular, while in San Cristóbal, one may be more likely to find the rhythm. While they play their drums, one of the paleros simultaneously sings verses of a song. The surrounding audience often invokes spirits of ancestors or saints, and it is not unusual to encounter participants becoming possessed at these events.

===Bachata===

Bachata is a guitar-based genre that originated in the Dominican countryside and developed into a music style in urban Santo Domingo&#x27;s shantytowns in the 1960s. The term originally referred to informal gatherings in backyards. Early bachata drew influence from a wide range of Latin American genres, including Cuban bolero and son, Puerto Rican music, Mexican and , Colombian and , and Dominican merengue. A typical bachata group features five instruments: the requinto (lead guitar), segunda (rhythm guitar), bass, bongos, and güira. Over time, the instrumentation has evolved, reflecting musicians&#x27; personal styles and the genre&#x27;s development. Some have incorporated electric guitars, piano, saxophones, and additional percussion instruments like timbales.

In the 1970s and 1980s, bachata was dismissed by the Dominican elites due to its association with rural, working-class communities, its use of sexual innuendo, and the informal musical training of many performers. However, the release of Juan Luis Guerra&#x27;s album in the early 1990s propelled bachata into the mainstream, eventually surpassing merengue in both popularity and album sales. Despite this, bachata flourished and has now gained worldwide acceptance. One of the most popular bands making bachata music was Aventura.

===Dominican Rock===

Dominican rock is also popular among younger and older crowds of the Dominican Republic. Dominican rock is influenced by British and American rock, but also has its own sense of unique style. The rock scene in the Dominican Republic has been very vibrant in recent years, spanning many genres of rock such as pop rock, reggae/rock, punk, metal. Dominican rock had started its scene in the early 1980s, when Luis Días &amp; Transporte Urbano, (who is considered to be the father of Dominican rock), came onto the scene and created this genre. Since then, there have been hundreds of Dominican rock bands, with the most successful being Toque Profundo, Cahobazul, Guaitiao, Tabu Tek, Al-Jadaqui Tribu del Sol, Joe Blandino, Edwin Amorfy, Vicente Garcia, Álex Ferreira, Top 40, TKR, Poket, La Siembra, La Reforma and others. Rita Indiana y los Misterios are a musical group known for their blend of traditional merengue music with rock. Bocatabu, Dronk, Futuros Divorciados and 42-01 are new Dominican rock groups who are also on the rise.

There are also several underground Metal concerts occurring occasionally mainly in the cities of Santo Domingo and Santiago, where teenagers and young adults usually not satisfied with the other genres express themselves.

===Hip hop===
Hip hop is a cultural movement developed in New York City in the 1970s primarily by African Americans and Afro-Latinos. Since first emerging in The Bronx and Harlem, the lifestyle of hip hop culture has today spread around the world. One of the places hip hop spread to was the Dominican Republic. The four historic elements of hip hop are: MCing (rapping), DJing, urban inspired art/tagging (graffiti), and b-boying (or breakdancing). The most known extended elements are beatboxing, hip hop fashion, and hip hop slang. All these elements have been carried on into the Dominican Republic since the mid 80s by young immigrants who returned to their mother land, usually from Puerto Rico, New York, Boston and Florida. Dominican hip hop started to gain national popularity in the years 2006 and 2007.

=== Dembow and Reggaeton Dominicano ===
Even though reggaeton originated with reggae en español in Panama and gradually evolved to reggaeton in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic was the third country in Latin America to which reggaeton was introduced. It has had a long history of reggaeton music, more closely associated with Puerto Rican music. 

Dominican dembow is formed by making the dembow rhythm faster, louder, simplified and more repetitive. Dominican recording artists include Black Point, Messiah El Artista, Monkey Black, Mozart La Para, Makleen, Juancho and Reychesta of Tres Coronas, Sensato del Patio, Rochy RD, El Alfa, Chimbala and Don Miguelo. 

Some artists in reggaeton include Luny Tunes, who are one of the biggest and most popular producers in the genre, and have produced big hit reggaeton songs such as Daddy Yankee&#x27;s smash hit &quot;Gasolina&quot;, among other chart toppers. Some reggaeton artists are of Dominican descent, or by association like Ozuna (Half Dominican Half Puerto Rican), Arcángel &amp; De La Ghetto (Both Half Dominican), Nicky Jam (Half Dominican). 

==Art music==

===Jazz===
The most renowned exponent is Michel Camilo.

===Classical music===
Conservatorio Nacional de Música is the academy of music of the Dominican Republic. It was founded by José de Jesús Ravelo (Don Chuchú), one of the main Dominican composers.

<text>Schizoaffective disorder is a mental disorder characterized by symptoms of both schizophrenia (psychosis) and a mood disorder, either bipolar disorder or depression. The main diagnostic criterion is the presence of psychotic symptoms for at least two weeks without prominent mood symptoms. Common symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech and thinking, as well as mood episodes. Schizoaffective disorder can often be misdiagnosed when the correct diagnosis may be psychotic depression, bipolar I disorder, schizophreniform disorder, or schizophrenia. This is a problem as treatment and prognosis differ greatly for most of these diagnoses. Many people with schizoaffective disorder have other mental disorders including anxiety disorders.

There are three forms of schizoaffective disorder: bipolar (or manic) type (marked by symptoms of schizophrenia and mania), depressive type (marked by symptoms of schizophrenia and depression), and mixed type (marked by symptoms of schizophrenia, depression, and mania). Auditory hallucinations, or &quot;hearing voices&quot;, are most common. The onset of symptoms usually begins in adolescence or young adulthood. On a ranking scale of symptom progression relating to the schizophrenic spectrum, schizoaffective disorder falls between mood disorders and schizophrenia in regards to severity.

Genetics (researched in the field of genomics); problems with neural circuits; chronic early, and chronic or short-term current environmental stress appear to be important causal factors. No single isolated organic cause has been found, but extensive evidence exists for abnormalities in the metabolism of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), dopamine, and glutamic acid in people with schizophrenia, psychotic mood disorders, and schizoaffective disorder.

While a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is rare, 0.3% in the general population, it is considered a common diagnosis among psychiatric disorders. Diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is based on DSM-5 criteria, which consist principally of the presence of symptoms of schizophrenia, mania, and depression, and the temporal relationships between them.

The main current treatment is antipsychotic medication combined with either or both of mood stabilizers and antidepressants. There is growing concern by some researchers that antidepressants may increase psychosis, mania, and long-term mood episode cycling in the disorder. When there is risk to self or others, usually early in treatment, hospitalization may be necessary. Psychiatric rehabilitation, psychotherapy, and vocational rehabilitation are very important for recovery of higher psychosocial function. As a group, people diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder using DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria (which have since been updated) have a better outcome, but have variable individual psychosocial functional outcomes compared to people with mood disorders, from worse to the same. Outcomes for people with DSM-5 diagnosed schizoaffective disorder depend on data from prospective cohort studies, which have not been completed yet. The DSM-5 diagnosis was updated because DSM-IV criteria resulted in overuse of the diagnosis; that is, DSM-IV criteria led to many patients being misdiagnosed with the disorder. DSM-IV prevalence estimates were less than one percent of the population, in the range of 0.5–0.8 percent; newer DSM-5 prevalence estimates are not yet available.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Schizoaffective disorder is defined by &quot;mood disorder-free psychosis&quot; in the context of a long-term psychotic and mood disorder. Psychosis must meet criterion A for schizophrenia which may include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior and negative symptoms. Both delusions and hallucinations are classic symptoms of psychosis. Delusions are false beliefs which are strongly held despite evidence to the contrary. Beliefs should not be considered delusional if they are in keeping with cultural beliefs. Delusional beliefs may or may not reflect mood symptoms (for example, someone experiencing depression may or may not experience delusions of guilt). Hallucinations are disturbances in perception involving any of the five senses, although auditory hallucinations (or &quot;hearing voices&quot;) are the most common. Negative symptoms include alogia (lack of speech), blunted affect (reduced intensity of outward emotional expression), avolition (lack of motivation), and anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure). Negative symptoms can be more lasting and more debilitating than positive symptoms of psychosis.

Mood symptoms are of mania, hypomania, mixed episode, or depression, and tend to be episodic rather than continuous. A mixed episode represents a combination of symptoms of mania and depression at the same time. Symptoms of mania include elevated or irritable mood, grandiosity (inflated self-esteem), agitation, risk-taking behavior, decreased need for sleep, poor concentration, rapid speech, and racing thoughts. Symptoms of depression include low mood, apathy, changes in appetite or weight, disturbances in sleep, changes in motor activity, fatigue, guilt or feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal thinking.

DSM-5 states that if a patient only experiences psychotic symptoms during a mood episode, their diagnosis is mood disorder with psychotic features and not schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. If the patient experiences psychotic symptoms without mood symptoms for longer than a two-week period, their diagnosis is either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. If mood disorder episodes are present for the majority and residual course of the illness and up until the diagnosis, the patient can be diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.

== Causes ==
A combination of genetic and environmental factors are believed to play a role in the development of schizoaffective disorder.

Viewed broadly then, biological and environmental factors interact with a person&#x27;s genes in ways which may increase or decrease the risk for developing schizoaffective disorder; exactly how this happens (the biological mechanism) is not yet known. Schizophrenia spectrum disorders, of which schizoaffective disorder is a part, have been increasingly linked to advanced paternal age at the time of conception, a known cause of genetic mutations. The physiology of people diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder appears to be similar, but not identical, to that of those diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; however, human neurophysiological function in normal brain and mental disorder syndromes is not fully understood.

While there are various medications and treatment options for those with schizoaffective disorder, this disorder can affect a person for their entire lifespan. In some cases, this disorder can affect a person&#x27;s ability to have a fulfilling social life and they may also have trouble forming bonds or relationships with others. Schizoaffective disorder is also more likely to occur in women and begins at a young age.

=== Substance use disorder ===
A clear causal connection between substance use and psychotic spectrum disorders, including schizoaffective disorder, has been difficult to prove. In the specific case of cannabis (marijuana), however, evidence supports a link between earlier onset of psychotic illness and cannabis use. The more often cannabis is used, particularly in early adolescence, the more likely a person is to develop a psychotic illness, with frequent use being correlated with double the risk of psychosis and schizoaffective disorder. A 2009 Yale review stated that in individuals with an established psychotic disorder, cannabinoids can exacerbate symptoms, trigger relapse, and have negative consequences on the course of the illness. While cannabis use is accepted as a contributory cause of schizoaffective disorder by many, it remains controversial, since not all young people who use cannabis later develop psychosis, but those who do use cannabis have an increased odds ratio of about 3. Certain drugs can imitate symptoms of schizophrenia (which is known to have similar symptoms to schizoaffective disorder). This is important to note when including that substance-induced psychosis should be ruled out when diagnosing patients so that patients are not misdiagnosed.

== Mechanisms ==
Though the pathophysiology of schizoaffective disorder remains unclear, studies suggest that dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin may be factors in the development of the disorder. White matter and grey matter reductions in the right lentiform nucleus, left superior temporal gyrus, and right precuneus, and other areas in the brain are also characteristic of schizoaffective disorder. Deformities in white matter have also been found to worsen with time in individuals with schizoaffective disorder. Due to its role in emotional regulation, researchers believe that the hippocampus is also involved in the progression of schizoaffective disorder. Specifically, psychotic disorders (such as schizoaffective disorder) have been associated with lower hippocampal volumes. Moreover, deformities in the medial and thalamic regions of the brain have been implicated as contributing factors to the disorder as well.

== Diagnosis ==
Psychosis as a symptom of a psychiatric disorder is first and foremost a diagnosis of exclusion. So a new-onset episode of psychosis &quot;cannot&quot; be considered to be a symptom of a psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known medical causes of psychosis are excluded, or ruled out. Many clinicians improperly perform, or entirely miss this step, introducing avoidable diagnostic error and misdiagnosis.

An initial assessment includes a comprehensive history and physical examination. Although no biological laboratory tests exist which confirm schizoaffective disorder, biological tests should be performed to exclude psychosis associated with or caused by substance use, medications, toxins or poisons, surgical complications, or other medical illnesses. Since non-medical mental health practitioners are not trained to exclude medical causes of psychosis, people experiencing psychosis should be referred to an emergency department or hospital.

Delirium should be ruled out, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, indicating other underlying factors which includes medical illnesses. Excluding medical illnesses associated with psychosis is performed by using blood tests to measure:

* Thyroid-stimulating hormone to exclude hypo- or hyperthyroidism,
* Basic electrolytes and serum calcium to rule out a metabolic disturbance,
* Full blood count including ESR to rule out a systemic infection or chronic disease, and
* Serology to exclude syphilis or HIV infection.

Other investigations which may be performed include:
* EEG to exclude epilepsy, and an
* MRI or CT scan of the head to exclude brain lesions.

Blood tests are not usually repeated for relapse in people with an established diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, unless there is a specific &quot;medical&quot; indication. These may include serum BSL if olanzapine has previously been prescribed, thyroid function if lithium has previously been taken to rule out hypothyroidism, liver function tests if chlorpromazine has been prescribed, CPK levels to exclude neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and a urinalysis and serum toxicology screening if substance use is suspected. Assessment and treatment may be done on an outpatient basis; admission to an inpatient facility is considered if there is a risk to self or others.

Because psychosis may be precipitated or exacerbated by common classes of psychiatric medications, such as antidepressants, ADHD stimulant medications, and sleep medications, prescribed medication-induced psychosis should be ruled out, particularly for first-episode psychosis. This is an essential step to reduce diagnostic error and to evaluate potential medication sources of further patient harm. Regarding prescribed medication sources of patient harm, Yale School of Medicine Professor of Psychiatry Malcolm B. Bowers Jr, MD wrote:
Illicit drugs aren&#x27;t the only ones that precipitate psychosis or mania—prescribed drugs can too, and in particular, some psychiatric drugs. We investigated this and found that about 1 in 12 psychotic or manic patients in an inpatient psychiatric facility are there due to antidepressant-induced psychosis or mania. That&#x27;s unfortunate for the field [of psychiatry] and disastrous for some of our patients.
Substance-induced psychosis should also be ruled out. Both substance- and medication-induced psychosis can be excluded to a high level of certainty while the person is psychotic, typically in an emergency department, using both a:
* Broad spectrum urine toxicology screening, and a
* Full serum toxicology screening (of the blood).

Some dietary supplements may also induce psychosis or mania, but cannot be ruled out with laboratory tests. So a psychotic person&#x27;s family, partner, or friends should be asked whether he or she is currently taking any dietary supplements.

Common mistakes made when diagnosing psychotic patients include:
* Not properly excluding delirium,
* Missing a toxic psychosis by not screening for substances &quot;and&quot; medications,
* Not appreciating medical abnormalities (e.g., vital signs),
* Not obtaining a medical history and family history,
* Indiscriminate screening without an organizing framework,
* Not asking family or others about dietary supplements,
* Premature diagnostic closure, and
* Not revisiting or questioning the initial diagnostic impression of primary psychiatric disorder.
Schizoaffective disorder can only be diagnosed among those who have undergone a clinical evaluation with a psychiatrist. The criterion includes mental and physical symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions, and depressive episodes. There are also links to bad hygiene and a troubled social life for those with schizoaffective disorder. Research has failed to conclusively demonstrate a positive relationship between schizoaffective disorder and substance abuse. There are several theorized causations for the onset of Schizoaffective disorder, including, genetics, general brain function, like chemistry, and structure, and stress.

Only after these relevant and known causes of psychosis have been ruled out can a psychiatric differential diagnosis be made. A mental health clinician will incorporate family history, observation of a psychotic person&#x27;s behavior while the person is experiencing active symptoms, to begin a psychiatric differential diagnosis. Diagnosis also includes self-reported experiences, as well as behavioral abnormalities reported by family members, friends, or significant others. Mistakes in this stage include:
* Not screening for dissociative disorders. Dissociative identity disorder and psychotic symptoms in schizoaffective disorder have considerable overlap, yet a different overall treatment approach.

=== DSM-5 criteria ===
The most widely used criteria for diagnosing schizoaffective disorder are from the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5&quot;.

The DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder definition was plagued by problems of being inconsistently (or unreliably) used on patients; when the diagnosis is made, it does not stay with most patients over time, and it has questionable diagnostic validity (that is, it does not describe a distinct disorder, nor predict any particular outcome). These problems have been slightly reduced (or &quot;modestly improved&quot;) in the DSM-5 according to Carpenter.

When psychotic symptoms are confined to an episode of mania or depression (with or without mixed features), the diagnosis is that of a &quot;psychotic&quot; mood disorder, namely either psychotic bipolar disorder or psychotic major depression. Only when psychotic states persist in a sustained fashion for two weeks or longer without concurrent affective symptoms is the diagnosis schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder or schizophrenia.

The second cardinal guideline in the DSM-5 diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is one of timeframe.
::DSM-5 requires two episodes of psychosis (whereas DSM-IV needed only one) to qualify for the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis. As such, it is no longer an &quot;episode diagnosis.&quot; The new schizoaffective framework looks at the time from &quot;the [first episode of] psychosis up to the current episode [of psychosis], rather than only defining a single episode with [co-occurring] psychotic and mood syndromes.&quot; Specifically, one of the episodes of psychosis must last a minimum of two weeks without mood disorder symptoms, but the person may be mildly to moderately depressed while psychotic. The other period of psychosis &quot;requires the overlap of mood [disorder] symptoms with psychotic symptoms to be conspicuous&quot; and last for a greater portion of the disorder.

These two changes are intended by the DSM-5 workgroup to accomplish two goals:

* Increase the diagnosis&#x27; consistency (or reliability) when it is used;
* Significantly decrease the overall use of the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis.

If the schizoaffective diagnosis is used less often, other diagnoses (like psychotic mood disorders and schizophrenia) are likely to be used more often; but this is hypothetical until real-world data arrive. Validity problems with the diagnosis remain and await further work in the fields of psychiatric genetics, neuroimaging, and cognitive science that includes the overlapping fields of cognitive, affective, and social neuroscience, which may change the way schizoaffective disorder is conceptualized and defined in future versions of the DSM and ICD.

==== Comorbidities ====
Schizoaffective disorder shares a high level of comorbidity with anxiety disorders, depression, and bipolar disorder. Individuals with schizoaffective disorder are also often diagnosed with substance abuse disorder, usually relating to tobacco, marijuana, or alcohol. Health care providers indicate the importance of assessing for co-occurring substance use disorders, as multiple diagnoses not only potentially increase negative symptomology, but may also adversely affect the treatment of schizoaffective disorder.

==== Types ====
One of three types of schizoaffective disorder may be noted in a diagnosis based on the mood component of the disorder:

* Bipolar type, when the disturbance includes manic episodes, hypomania, or mixed episodes—major depressive episodes also typically occur;
* Depressive type, when the disturbance includes major depressive episodes exclusively—that is, without manic, hypomanic, or mixed episodes.
* Mixed type, when the disturbance includes both manic and depressive symptoms, but psychotic symptoms exist separately from bipolar disorder.

==== Problems with DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder ====
The American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder persisted for 19 years (1994–2013). Clinicians adequately trained in diagnosis used the schizoaffective diagnosis too often, largely because the criteria were poorly defined, ambiguous, and hard to use (or poorly operationalized). Poorly trained clinicians used the diagnosis without making necessary exclusions of common causes of psychosis, including some prescribed psychiatric medications. Specialty books written by experts on schizoaffective disorder have existed for over eight years before DSM-5 describing the overuse of the diagnosis.

Carpenter and the DSM-5 schizoaffective disorders workgroup analyzed data made available to them in 2009, and reported in May 2013 that:
a recent review of psychotic disorders from large private insurance and Medicare databases in the U.S. found that the diagnosis of DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder was used for about a third of cases with non-affective psychotic disorders. Hence, this unreliable and poorly defined diagnosis is clearly overused.

As stated above, the DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder diagnosis is very inconsistently used or unreliable. A diagnosis is unreliable when several different mental health professionals observing the same individual make different diagnoses excessively. Even when a structured DSM-IV diagnostic interview and best estimate procedures were made by experts in the field that included information from family informants and prior clinical records, reliability was still poor for the DSM-IV schizoaffective diagnosis.

The DSM-IV schizoaffective diagnosis is not stable over time either. An initial diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder during time spent at a psychiatric inpatient facility was stable at 6-month and 24-month follow ups for only 36% of patients. By comparison, diagnostic stability was 92% for schizophrenia, 83% for bipolar disorder and 74% for major depression. Most patients diagnosed with DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder are later diagnosed with a different disorder, and that disorder is more stable over time than the DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder diagnosis.

In April 2009, Carpenter and the DSM-5 schizoaffective disorder workgroup reported that they were &quot;developing new criteria for schizoaffective disorder to improve reliability and face validity,&quot; and were &quot;determining whether the dimensional assessment of mood [would] justify a recommendation to drop schizoaffective disorder as a diagnostic category.&quot; Speaking to an audience at the May 2009 annual conference of the American Psychiatric Association, Carpenter said:
We had hoped to get rid of schizoaffective [disorder] as a diagnostic category [in the DSM-5] because we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s [a] valid [scientific entity] and we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reliable. On the other hand, we think it&#x27;s absolutely indispensable to clinical practice.

A major reason why DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder was indispensable to clinical practice is because it offered clinicians a diagnosis for patients with psychosis in the context of mood disorder whose clinical picture, at the time diagnosed, appeared different from DSM-IV &quot;schizophrenia&quot; or &quot;mood disorder with psychotic features&quot;.

But DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder carries an unnecessarily worse prognosis than a &quot;mood disorder with psychotic features&quot; diagnosis, because long-term data revealed that a significant proportion of DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder patients had 15-year outcomes indistinguishable from patients with mood disorders with or without psychotic features, even though the clinical picture at the time of first diagnosis looked different from both schizophrenia and mood disorders.

These problems with the DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder definition result in most people the diagnosis is used on being misdiagnosed; furthermore, outcome studies done 10 years after the diagnosis was released showed that the group of patients defined by the DSM-IV and ICD-10 schizoaffective diagnosis had significantly better outcomes than predicted, so the diagnosis carries a misleading and unnecessarily poor prognosis. The DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder will continue to be used on U.S. board examinations in psychiatry through the end of 2014; established practitioners may continue to use the problematic DSM-IV definition much further into the future also.

==== DSM-5 research directions ====
The new schizoaffective disorder criteria continue to have questionable diagnostic validity. Questionable diagnostic validity does not doubt that people with symptoms of psychosis and mood disorder need treatment—psychosis and mood disorder must be treated. Instead, questionable diagnostic validity means there are unresolved problems with the way the DSM-5 categorizes and defines schizoaffective disorder.

A core concept in modern psychiatry since DSM-III was released in 1980, is the categorical separation of mood disorders from schizophrenia, known as the Kraepelinian dichotomy. Emil Kraepelin introduced the idea that schizophrenia was separate from mood disorders after observing patients with symptoms of psychosis and mood disorder, over a century ago, in 1898. This was a time before genetics were known and before any treatments existed for mental illness. The Kraepelinian dichotomy was not used for DSM-I and DSM-II because both manuals were influenced by the dominant psychodynamic psychiatry of the time, but the designers of DSM-III wanted to use more scientific and biological definitions. Consequently, they looked to psychiatry&#x27;s history and decided to use the Kraepelinian dichotomy as a foundation for the classification system.

The Kraepelinian dichotomy continues to be used in DSM-5 despite having been challenged by data from modern psychiatric genetics for over eight years, and there is now evidence of a significant overlap in the genetics of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. According to this genetic evidence, the Kraepelinian categorical separation of mood disorders from schizophrenia at the foundation of the current classification and diagnostic system is a mistaken false dichotomy.

The dichotomy at the foundation of the current system forms the basis for a convoluted schizoaffective disorder definition in DSM-IV that resulted in excessive misdiagnosis. Real life schizoaffective disorder patients have significant and enduring symptoms that bridge what are incorrectly assumed to be categorically separate disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. People with psychotic depression, bipolar disorder with a history of psychosis, and schizophrenia with mood symptoms also have symptoms that bridge psychosis and mood disorders. The categorical diagnostic manuals do not reflect reality in their separation of psychosis (via the schizophrenia diagnosis) from mood disorder, nor do they currently emphasize the actual overlap found in real-life patients. Thus, they are likely to continue to introduce either-or conceptual and diagnostic error, by way of confirmation bias into clinicians&#x27; mindsets, hindering accurate assessment and treatment.

The new definition continues the lack of parsimony of the old definition. Simpler, clearer, and more usable definitions of the diagnosis were supported by certain members of the DSM-5 workgroup; these were debated but deemed premature, because more &quot;research [is] needed to establish a new classification system of equal or greater validity&quot; to the existing system. Because of DSM-5&#x27;s continuing problematic categorical foundation, schizoaffective disorder&#x27;s conceptual and diagnostic validity remains doubtful. After enough research is completed and data exists, future diagnostic advances will need to either eliminate and replace, or soften and bridge, the hard categorical separation of mood disorders from schizophrenia; most likely using a spectrum or dimensional approach to diagnosis.

More parsimonious definitions than the current one were considered by Carpenter and the DSM-5 workgroup:
One option for the DSM-5 would have been to remove the schizoaffective disorder category and to add affective [or mood] symptoms [that is, mania, hypomania, mixed episode, or depression] as a dimension to schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder &quot;or&quot; to define a single category for the co-occurrence of psychosis and mood symptoms. This option was extensively debated but ultimately deemed to be premature in the absence of sufficient clinical and theoretical validating data justifying such a … reconceptualization. Additionally, there appeared to be no practical way to introduce affect [or mood] dimensions covering the entire course of illness, that would capture the current concept of periods of psychosis related and unrelated to mood episodes.

The field of psychiatry has begun to question its assumptions and analyze its data in order to merge closer with evidence-based medicine. The removal of the &quot;episode diagnosis&quot;, and the addition of two episodes of psychosis, as qualifications for the DSM-5 schizoaffective diagnosis, may improve the diagnosis&#x27; consistency over DSM-IV for research purposes, where diagnostic criteria are by necessity followed &quot;exactingly&quot;. But the new definition remains long, unwieldy, and perhaps still not very useful for community clinicians—with two psychoses, one for two weeks minimum and without mood disorder (but the person can be mildly or moderately depressed) and the other with significant mood disorder and psychosis lasting for most of the time, and with lasting mood symptoms for most of the residual portion of the illness. Community clinicians used the previous definition &quot;for about a third of cases with non-affective psychotic disorders.&quot; Non-affective psychotic disorders are, by definition, not schizoaffective disorder. For clinicians to make such sizeable errors of misdiagnosis may imply systemic problems with the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis itself. Already, at least one expert believes the new schizoaffective definition has not gone far enough to solve the previous definition&#x27;s problems.

From a scientific standpoint, modern clinical psychiatry is still a very young, underdeveloped medical specialty because its target organ, the human brain, is not yet well understood. The human brain&#x27;s neural circuits, for example, are just beginning to be mapped by modern neuroscience in the Human Connectome Project and CLARITY. Clinical psychiatry, furthermore, has begun to understand and acknowledge its current limitations—but further steps by the field are required to significantly reduce misdiagnosis and patient harm; this is crucial both for responsible patient care and to retain public trust. Looking forward, a paradigm shift is needed in psychiatric research to address unanswered questions about schizoaffective disorder. The dimensional Research Domain Criteria project currently being developed by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health, may be the specific problem solving framework psychiatry needs to develop a more scientifically mature understanding of schizoaffective disorder as well as all other mental disorders.

== Treatment ==
The primary treatment of schizoaffective disorder is medication, with improved outcomes using combined long-term psychological and social supports. Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization started in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment and support groups are common. Evidence indicates that regular exercise has a positive effect on the physical and mental health of those with schizoaffective disorder.

Because of the heterogeneous symptomology associated with schizoaffective disorder, it is common for patients to be misdiagnosed. Many people are either diagnosed with depression, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder instead of schizoaffective disorder. Because of the broad range of symptoms of Schizoaffective disorder, patients are often misdiagnosed in a clinical setting. In fact, almost 39% of people are misdiagnosed when it comes to psychiatric disorders.

While various medications and treatment options &quot;exist&quot; for those diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, symptoms may continue to impact a person for their entire lifespan.&quot;Schizoaffective&quot; disorder can affect a person&#x27;s ability to experience a fulfilling social life and they may also exhibit difficulty forming bonds or relationships with others. Schizoaffective disorder is more likely to occur in women and symptoms begin manifesting at a young age.

=== Therapy ===
Psychosocial treatments have been found to improve outcomes related to schizoaffective disorder. Supportive psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy are both helpful. Intensive case management (ICM) has been shown to reduce hospitalizations, improve adherence to treatment, and improve social functioning. With ICM, clients are assigned a case manager responsible for coordination of care and assisting clients to access supports to address needs in multiple areas related to well-being, including housing.

Psychiatric/psychosocial rehabilitation is often a component of schizoaffective disorder treatment. This rehabilitation method focuses on solving community integration problems such as obtaining and keeping housing and increasing involvement in positive social groups. It also focuses on improving and increasing activities of daily living; increasing daily healthy habits and decreasing unhealthy behaviors, thereby significantly improving quality of life. Psychiatric rehabilitation may also focus on vocational rehabilitation. Evidence suggests that cognition-based approaches may be able to improve work and social functioning.

Psychiatric rehabilitation consists of eight main areas:

* Psychiatric (symptom reduction and management)
* Health and Medical (maintaining consistency of care)
* Housing (safe environments)
* Basic living skills (hygiene, meals [including increasing healthy food intake and reducing processed food intake], safety, planning and chores)
* Social (relationships, family boundaries, communication and integration of client into the community)
* Education and vocation (coping skills, motivation and suitable goals chosen by client)
* Finance (personal budget)
* Community and legal (resources)

=== Medication ===
Antipsychotic medication is usually required both for acute treatment and the prevention of relapse. There is no single antipsychotic of choice in treating schizoaffective disorder, but atypical antipsychotics may be considered due to their mood-stabilizing abilities. To date, paliperidone (Invega) is the only antipsychotic with FDA approval for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder. Other antipsychotics may be prescribed to further alleviate psychotic symptoms.

Though not approved for treatment use by the FDA, research suggests that Clozapine may also be effective in treating schizoaffective disorder, particularly in those resistant to initial medication. Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is recognized as being particularly effective when other antipsychotic agents have failed. When combined with cognitive therapy, Clozapine has been found to decrease positive and negative symptoms of psychosis at a higher rate in schizoaffective individuals. Clozapine has also been associated with a decreased risk of suicide in patients with schizoaffective disorder and a history of suicidality. Despite this, clozapine treatment may be ineffective for some patients, particularly in those that are already drug-resistant.

The management of the bipolar type of schizoaffective disorder is similar to the treatment of bipolar disorder, with the goal of preventing mood episodes and cycling. Lithium or anticonvulsant mood stabilizers such as valproic acid, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine are prescribed in combination with an antipsychotic.

Antidepressants have also been used to treat schizoaffective disorder. Though they may be useful in treating the depressive subtype of the disorder, research suggests that antidepressants are far less effective in treatment than antipsychotics and mood stabilizers.

Some research has supported the efficacy of anxiolytics in treating schizoaffective disorder, though general findings on their effectiveness in treating schizoaffective disorder remain inconclusive. Due to the severe negative outcomes associated with many anti-anxiety drugs, many researchers have cautioned against their long term use in treatment.

=== Electroconvulsive therapy ===
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for patients with schizoaffective disorder experiencing severe depression or severe psychotic symptoms that have not responded to treatment with antipsychotics.

== Epidemiology ==
Compared to depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder is less commonly diagnosed. Schizoaffective disorder is estimated to occur in 0.3 to 0.8 percent of people at some point in their life. 30% of cases occur between the ages of 25 and 35. It is more common in women than men; however, this is because of the high concentration of women in the depressive subcategory, whereas the bipolar subtype has a roughly even gender distribution. Children are less likely to be diagnosed with this disorder, as the onset presents itself in adolescence or young adulthood.

== History ==
The term &quot;schizoaffective psychosis&quot; was introduced by the American psychiatrist Jacob Kasanin in 1933 to describe an episodic psychotic illness with predominant affective symptoms, that was thought at the time to be a good-prognosis schizophrenia. Kasanin&#x27;s concept of the illness was influenced by the psychoanalytic teachings of Adolf Meyer and Kasanin postulated that &quot;schizoaffective psychosis&quot; was caused by &quot;emotional conflicts&quot; of a &quot;mainly sexual nature&quot; and that psychoanalysis &quot;would help prevent the recurrence of such attacks.&quot; He based his description on a case study of nine individuals.

Other psychiatrists, before and after Kasanin, have made scientific observations of schizoaffective disorder based on assumptions of a biological and genetic cause of the illness. In 1863, German psychiatrist Karl Kahlbaum (18281899) described schizoaffective disorders as a separate group in his &quot;vesania typica circularis&quot;. Kahlbaum distinguished between cross-sectional and longitudinal observations. In 1920, psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (18561926) observed a &quot;great number&quot; of cases that had characteristics of both groups of psychoses that he originally posited were two distinct and separate illnesses, &quot;dementia praecox&quot; (now called schizophrenia) and &quot;manic depressive insanity&quot; (now called bipolar disorders and recurrent depression).

Kraepelin acknowledged that &quot;there are many overlaps in this area,&quot; that is, the area between schizophrenia and mood disorders. In 1959, psychiatrist Kurt Schneider (18871967) began to further refine conceptualizations of the different forms that schizoaffective disorders can take since he observed &quot;concurrent and sequential types&quot;. (The &quot;concurrent type&quot; of illness he referred to is a longitudinal course of illness with episodes of mood disorder and psychosis occurring predominantly at the same time [now called psychotic mood disorders or affective psychosis]; while his &quot;sequential type&quot; refers to a longitudinal course predominantly marked by alternating mood and psychotic episodes.) Schneider described schizoaffective disorders as &quot;cases in-between&quot; the traditional Kraepelinian dichotomy of schizophrenia and mood disorders.

The historical clinical observation that schizoaffective disorder is an overlap of schizophrenia and mood disorders is explained by genes for both illnesses being present in individuals with schizoaffective disorder; specifically, recent research shows that schizophrenia and mood disorders share common genes &quot;and&quot; polygenic variations.
Schizoaffective disorder was included as a subtype of schizophrenia in DSM-I and DSM-II, though research showed a schizophrenic cluster of symptoms in individuals with a family history of mood disorders whose illness course, other symptoms and treatment outcome were otherwise more akin to bipolar disorder than to schizophrenia. DSM-III placed schizoaffective disorder in &quot;Psychotic Disorders Not Otherwise Specified&quot; before being formally recognized in DSM-III-R. DSM-III-R included its own diagnostic criteria as well as the subtypes, bipolar and depressive. In DSM-IV, published in 1994, schizoaffective disorders belonged to the category &quot;Other Psychotic Disorders&quot; and included almost the same criteria and the same subtypes of illness as DSM-III-R, with the addition of mixed bipolar symptomatology.

DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR (published in 2000) criteria for schizoaffective disorder were poorly defined and poorly operationalized. These ambiguous and unreliable criteria lasted 19 years and led clinicians to significantly overuse the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis. Patients commonly diagnosed with DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder showed a clinical picture at time of diagnosis that appeared different from schizophrenia or psychotic mood disorders using DSM-IV criteria, but who as a group, were longitudinally determined to have outcomes indistinguishable from those with mood disorders with or without psychotic features. A poor prognosis was assumed to apply to these patients by most clinicians, and this poor prognosis was harmful to many patients. The poor prognosis for DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder was not based on patient outcomes research, but was caused by poorly defined criteria interacting with clinical tradition and belief; clinician enculturation with unscientific assumptions from the diagnosis&#x27; history (discussed above), including the invalid Kraepelinian dichotomy; and by clinicians being unfamiliar with the scientific limitations of the diagnostic and classification system.

The DSM-5 schizoaffective disorder workgroup analyzed all of the available research evidence on schizoaffective disorder, and concluded that &quot;presenting symptoms of psychosis have little validity in determining diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment response.&quot; Given our understanding of overlapping genetics in bipolar disorders, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia, as well as the overlap in treatments for these disorders; but given the lack of specificity of presenting symptoms for determining diagnosis, prognosis or treatment response in these psychotic illness syndromes, the limits of our knowledge are clearer: &quot;Presenting symptoms of psychosis describe only presenting symptoms to be treated, and not much more&quot;. Schizoaffective disorder was changed to a longitudinal or life course diagnosis in DSM-5 for this reason.

Stigma of schizoaffective disorder include moralist arguments, religious causes, and others during history.

== Research ==
Little is known of the causes and mechanisms that lead to the development of schizoaffective disorder. Whether schizoaffective disorder is a variant of schizophrenia (as in DSM-5 and ICD-10 classification systems), a variant of bipolar disorder, or part of a dimensional continuum between psychotic depression, bipolar disorders and schizophrenia is currently being investigated.

More recently, some research suggests the need for a more specialized classification for schizoaffective disorder. In a 2017 examining diagnostic heterogeneity study, researchers found that when compared to a schizophrenia sample, individuals with schizoaffective disorder rate higher in suicidality and anxiety disorder comorbidity.

<text>The Khmer Republic (, ; ) was a Cambodian state under the United States-backed military dictatorship of Marshal Lon Nol from 1970 to 1975. Its establishment was formally declared on 9 October 1970, following the 18 March 1970 coup d&#x27;état which saw the overthrow of Norodom Sihanouk&#x27;s government and the abolition of the Cambodian monarchy.

The main cause of the coup was Norodom Sihanouk&#x27;s tolerance of North Vietnamese military activity within Cambodia&#x27;s borders; Vietnamese communist forces had gained &quot;de facto&quot; control over vast areas of eastern Cambodia as a result. Another important factor was the dire state of the Cambodian economy, an indirect result of Sihanouk&#x27;s policies of pursuing neutrality.

With the removal of Sihanouk, the existing Kingdom of Cambodia became a republic, officially removing Sisowath Kossamak. The character of the new regime was far-right and militaristic; most significantly, it ended Sihanouk&#x27;s period of covert co-operation with the North Vietnamese regime and the Viet Cong, and aligned Cambodia with South Vietnam in the ongoing Second Indochina War. The Khmer Republic was opposed within the Cambodian borders by the National United Front of Kampuchea (&quot;Front uni national de Kampuchéa&quot;, FUNK), a relatively broad alliance between Sihanouk, his supporters, and the Communist Party of Kampuchea.

The insurgency itself was conducted by the CPNLAF, the Cambodian People&#x27;s National Liberation Armed Forces: they were backed by both the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the National Liberation Front (NLF, better known as the Viet Cong), who occupied parts of Cambodia as part of their ongoing war with the South Vietnamese government.

Despite the large quantities of military and financial aid from the United States, the Khmer National Armed Forces (&quot;Forces armées nationales khmères&quot;, or FANK) were poorly trained and unable to defeat either the CPNLAF or the Vietnamese forces of the PAVN and NLF. The Republic eventually fell on 17 April 1975, when the Khmer Rouge took Phnom Penh and briefly restored the Kingdom of Cambodia before renaming itself Democratic Kampuchea on 5 January 1976.

== Political history ==
=== Coup ===
Sihanouk himself claimed that the coup was the result of an alliance between his longstanding enemies, the exiled right-wing nationalist Son Ngoc Thanh, the politician Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak (depicted by Sihanouk as a disgruntled rival claimant to the Cambodian throne) and the CIA, who wished to install a more US-friendly regime. There is in fact little if any evidence of CIA involvement in the coup, although it seems that sections of the US military establishment – notably the Army Special Forces – may have had some involvement in terms of offering support and training to the plotters after being approached by Lon Nol.

While Sihanouk was out of the country on a trip to France, anti-Vietnamese rioting took place in Phnom Penh, during which the North Vietnamese and NLF embassies were sacked. It seems likely that this rioting was at least tolerated, and possibly actively organised, by Lon Nol, the Prime Minister, and his deputy Prince Sirik Matak. On 12 March, the prime minister closed the port of Sihanoukville – through which weapons were being smuggled to the NLF – to the North Vietnamese and issued an impossible ultimatum to them. All PAVN/NLF forces were to withdraw from Cambodian soil within 72 hours (on 15 March) or face military action.

Despite these actions, which directly contradicted Sihanouk&#x27;s policy of partial tolerance of North Vietnamese activity, it appears that Lon Nol himself had great personal reluctance to depose the Head of State: he initially may merely have wanted Sihanouk to apply more pressure to the North Vietnamese. He initially refused to commit to the plan; to convince him, Sirik Matak – who appears to have had a coup in mind from the start – played him a tape-recorded press conference from Paris, in which Sihanouk threatened to execute them both on his return to Phnom Penh. However, the Prime Minister remained uncertain, with the result that Sirik Matak, accompanied by three army officers, compelled a weeping Lon Nol to sign the necessary documents at gunpoint.

A vote was taken in the National Assembly on 18 March under the direction of In Tam, in which Sihanouk was stripped of his power: Lon Nol assumed the powers of the Head of State on an emergency basis. On 28 and 29 March there were large-scale popular demonstrations in favour of Sihanouk in several provincial cities, but Lon Nol&#x27;s forces suppressed them with great brutality, causing several hundred deaths. Lon Nol&#x27;s brother Lon Nil was among a number of government officials who were murdered by demonstrators.

Foreign regimes were initially uncertain as to the level of support to give to the new government. The North Vietnamese continued to hold talks with Lon Nol regarding the reinstatement of the cancelled trade agreement, though subsequent events meant that these were soon to come to an end.

=== Declaration of the Khmer Republic and the formation of the FANK ===
The most significant immediate effect of the coup was the Cambodian campaign of April–July 1970, in which the South Vietnamese Army (ARVN), backed by US troops, entered eastern Cambodia to attack North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces operating there. Despite this assault, many of the communist forces escaped westward, deeper into Cambodia, or to the rural areas of the north-east, where they would provide support for the insurgency against Lon Nol.

Lon Nol&#x27;s immediate reaction was to condemn the action as a violation of Cambodian territory. He later informed Alexander Haig that his country had been placed in serious danger as a result. When Haig told him that American ground forces would not be used to assist the Cambodian army, and that (in accordance with the Nixon Doctrine) a programme of aid would be given instead, Lon Nol openly wept.

On 9 October Sihanouk was condemned to death &quot;in absentia&quot; by a military court; his mother, Queen Kossamak – the symbolic representative of the monarchy under Sihanouk&#x27;s regime – was placed under house arrest, and his wife Monique was sentenced to life imprisonment. The new regime simultaneously declared the Khmer Republic, and a new constitution was eventually to be adopted in 1972. Sihanouk, in the meantime, had formed GRUNK, a Beijing-based government-in-exile incorporating the communists and dedicated to the Republic&#x27;s overthrow; he declared Lon Nol to be a &quot;complete idiot&quot; and characterised Sirik Matak as &quot;nasty, perfidious, a lousy bastard&quot;.

The relatively small Royal Khmer Armed Forces (FARK), which at the time of the coup had around 35,000 troops (in accordance with Sihanouk&#x27;s stated policy of neutrality), was greatly expanded. Reorganising as the Khmer National Armed Forces (FANK), the republican military had grown to around 150,000 men as early as the end of 1970, mainly through voluntary enlistment as Lon Nol sought to capitalise on a wave of anti-Vietnamese sentiment. The US also implemented its programme of structured military aid and assistance in training, and flew in several thousand Khmer Serei and Khmer Kampuchea Krom militia, trained in South Vietnamese bases. The Joint Chiefs insisted on massive expansion of the FANK to over 200,000 men, despite concerns at the severe negative effect this would have on Cambodia&#x27;s economy, while the Military Equipment Delivery Team, led by General Theodore C. Mataxis, demanded the &#x27;Americanisation&#x27; of the army&#x27;s French-influenced internal structures, in spite of the chaos this caused in the supply chain.

Despite the US aid, the FANK (commanded by General Sosthène Fernandez) was seriously handicapped by corruption, particularly by officers claiming salaries for non-existent troops, and military incompetence. Although one of the FANK commanders – the former rebel Prince Norodom Chantaraingsey, who was coaxed out of military retirement by Lon Nol to raise the FANK&#x27;s 13th Brigade – was to have considerable success in &#x27;pacifying&#x27; the area around the strategic Highway 4 and the Kirirom Plateau, the majority of its generals had little military experience or ability. The large-scale FANK offensives against the Vietnamese, Operations Chenla I and II, ended in heavy defeat despite the conspicuous bravery of the individual Cambodian infantrymen.

As well as fighting the Cambodian Civil War against the pro-Sihanouk and communist insurgents and the North Vietnamese, the Khmer Republic faced considerable internal problems. Sihanouk&#x27;s domination of political life during the 1950s and 60s meant that there were few confident or experienced Cambodian politicians. Almost from the start, the Republic was plagued by many of the same political divisions and infighting that had marked Sihanouk&#x27;s regime; primary among these was a damaging power struggle between Lon Nol and Sirik Matak. Sirik Matak had been acting Prime Minister during the Republic&#x27;s first year, when Lon Nol&#x27;s health had been extremely poor, but had engendered considerable resentment due to his administrative style and royal connections; there was also growing frustration amongst young, urban Cambodians at the continued corruption and inefficiency of the regime.

On Lon Nol&#x27;s return from hospital in Hawaii in April 1971, he instigated a cabinet crisis by resigning, providing a means to dissolve the government, with the probable encouragement of his brother Lon Non (a figure of considerable influence, especially with the military). After much political squabbling, a new cabinet was formed, though Sirik Matak continued as acting premier with the title of &quot;Prime Minister-Delegate&quot;. On 16 October 1971, Lon Nol took action to strip the National Assembly of legislative power, and ordered it to write a new constitution, claiming that these actions were necessary to prevent anarchy; this provoked a protest by In Tam and 400 Buddhist monks.

===1972: Removal of Sirik Matak===
By 18 March 1972, Lon Nol and his brother had managed to drive Sirik Matak from power. After Sirik Matak had sacked Keo An, a dissident academic, Lon Non organised a series of vocal student demonstrations against him calling for his removal. Sirik Matak resigned, and (ostensibly for his &#x27;protection&#x27;) was placed under effective house arrest. Lon Nol used the crisis to oust the Head of State, Cheng Heng, and took over the role himself, appointing the veteran anti-Sihanouk nationalist Son Ngoc Thanh as Prime Minister. Thanh, leader of the Khmer Serei, had recruited FANK reinforcements amongst the Khmer Krom of southern Vietnam, and the loyalty he commanded amongst these comparatively elite, US-trained troops meant that his support for the Republic&#x27;s fragile government remained essential.

Later that year, Lon Nol announced he would hold presidential elections, and was surprised when In Tam and Keo An – the latter a reputed Sihanoukist – not only announced that they would run, but then refused to withdraw. The elections, despite an inevitable victory for Lon Nol, revealed considerable dissatisfaction with the government even though they had been rigged in Lon Nol&#x27;s favour: had they been fair, it is likely that In Tam would have won. The affair prompted In Tam to suggest that the Americans could now &quot;stew in Lon Nol&#x27;s juice&quot;.

The political situation continued to unravel throughout 1972: both opposition parties (In Tam&#x27;s Democratic Party and Sirik Matak&#x27;s Republican Party) refused to contest the elections to the National Assembly held in September, leading to a sweeping victory for Lon Non&#x27;s Socio-Republican Party (&quot;Sangkum Sathéaranak Râth&quot;). There were a growing number of terrorist attacks in the capital, one of which was directed at Son Ngoc Thanh. Thanh – whose last political act was to ban Sirik Matak&#x27;s newspaper – was then forced to resign, going back into South Vietnamese exile, and was replaced by the moderate leftist Hang Thun Hak.

While the Khmer Republic&#x27;s government was being weakened by infighting, North Vietnamese forces – who had previously carried out much of the fighting against the FANK, as in Operation Chenla I and II – gradually and deliberately scaled back their presence within Cambodian borders, leaving mainly logistical and support staff. Their place was taken by native Cambodian communist forces of the CPNLAF, which had been greatly increased when Sihanouk gave his support to the insurgency, rural Cambodians remaining overwhelmingly pro-Sihanouk.

===1973: Ceasefire and the suspension of the National Assembly===

The Paris Peace Accords of January 1973 seemed to offer a temporary respite from the civil war; Lon Nol declared a unilateral ceasefire, despite the FANK&#x27;s very weak position on the ground. There were in fact a few contacts between some of the more moderate elements of the Khmer Rouge communists – notably Hou Yuon – and the Republic. The North Vietnamese pressured the Cambodian communists to accept the terms of the peace accords; their interests lay more in keeping the war active at a low level (tying down South Vietnamese troops in the process) than in an outright victory for the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge leadership, however, remained intransigent.

The fighting resumed on the night of 7 February 1973, when communist forces attacked the FANK perimeter around the besieged city of Kampong Thom. By April, the Republic regime was in general disarray, with FANK troops refusing to fight and looting their own capital, and the CPNLAF advancing in many areas of the country. In response, the US finally threatened to cut off all aid unless Lon Nol acted to broaden the power base and support of the government – specifically, to reinstate the US ally Sirik Matak – and reduce the influence of his brother Lon Non.

Accordingly, on 24 April, Lon Nol announced that the National Assembly would be suspended, and that a Political Council formed of himself, Sirik Matak, Cheng Heng, and In Tam, would effectively rule by decree. The CPNLAF advance on Phnom Penh was eventually halted by American bombing, which caused horrific casualty levels amongst the communist troops. Some commentators state that the experience is likely to have contributed to the brutality shown by the Khmer Rouge cadres in later events.

===1974: Fall of Oudong===
By early 1974, the Political Council had been sidelined, and Lon Nol was once again ruling alone. The military situation, in the meantime, was deteriorating further. Communist forces came within shelling distance of Phnom Penh, and captured the former royal capital of Oudong in March: they &#x27;evacuated&#x27; its population – shooting government officials and teachers – and destroyed or burnt much of the town. There was a brief improvement as the year progressed, however, as the FANK retook Oudong, and was able to secure supply routes through Lake Tonlé Sap.

===End of the regime===
Despite this, the Khmer Republic did not survive the 1975 dry season offensive. The Khmer Rouge had by this point surrounded the capital, whose population had been vastly increased by refugees from the fighting; Lon Nol, who was extremely superstitious, ordered that consecrated sand be spread around the city from helicopters to protect it. Though the FANK was by this time fighting with extreme tenacity, and the Khmer Rouge soldiers were suffering from poor morale, malaria, and even higher rates of casualties than the FANK, fresh supplies of arms and ammunition from China gave them the impetus to overrun the Republic&#x27;s remaining outposts.

Proposed peace negotiations repeatedly stalled as Sihanouk refused to deal with Lon Nol directly, requesting his removal as a precondition. A plan proposed by Étienne Manac&#x27;h, the French Ambassador to China, in which Sihanouk would return to Cambodia as the head of a national unity government (leading to the likely immediate defection of a large proportion of the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s peasant soldiers), failed to materialise.

On 1 April 1975, Lon Nol resigned and fled the country into exile: the FANK almost immediately disintegrated. While Sirik Matak, Long Boret, Lon Non and several other politicians remained in the capital in an attempt to negotiate a ceasefire, Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge on 17 April. Within a few days they had executed many representatives of the old regime, and the Khmer Republic had effectively come to an end. During its brief existence it had received almost exactly one million dollars of US military and economic aid a day.

The final area held by the Republic in any form was the Preah Vihear Temple in the Dângrêk Mountains, which FANK forces still occupied in late April 1975. It was finally taken by the Khmer Rouge on 22 May that year.

<doc id="242906" wikidata="Q142599" url="?curid=242906" title="East India Company College">
<text>The East India Company College, or East India College, was an educational establishment situated at Hailey, Hertfordshire, nineteen miles north of London, founded in 1806 to train &quot;writers&quot; (administrators) for the East India Company. It provided general and vocational education for young gentlemen of sixteen to eighteen years old, who were nominated by the Company&#x27;s directors to writerships in its overseas civil service. The college&#x27;s counterpart for the training of officers for the company&#x27;s Presidency armies was Addiscombe Military Seminary, Surrey.

The East India Company was nationalised and the college closed in 1858, becoming a public school with continuing ties to the former college. The college buildings survive and are now occupied by the public school&#x27;s successor, Haileybury and Imperial Service College, a private school.

==History==
Charles Grant, Chairman of the British East India Company and a Member of Parliament (MP), was closely involved in the foundation of the college. It was first located in Hertford Castle but it was evident that a purpose-built seat of learning would be more suitable and in October 1805 the company purchased an estate just outside Hertford Heath for the sum of £5,930 () for this objective. The foundation stone of the new buildings were laid on 12 May 1806. The buildings cost the East India Company £92,000 (equivalent to £ in ) at the time of their erection to the designs of the architect William Wilkins (who later designed the National Gallery in London). The grounds were landscaped by Humphry Repton, his most notable work here being the terraced area to the front of Wilkins&#x27; main range and ponds to the west of this. Repton submitted his final account for work undertaken here just eight days before a carriage accident which left him crippled. The new buildings were occupied by students in 1809.

The East India Company had been incorporated in 1600 as a commercial entity. For two hundred years its administrators had been recruited, largely by patronage, to oversee commercial transactions in Asia. By 1800 they had become the &quot;de facto&quot; government for millions of people in those areas, but without much training for the role. The college was intended to address these shortcomings. In fifty years it trained over two thousand so-called &quot;writers&quot; to administer the Indian subcontinent.

The curriculum was wide, detailed, and targeted to the career responsibilities. It included political economy, history, mathematics, natural philosophy, classics, law and humanity and philology. Languages included Arabic, Urdu (Hindustani), Bengali, Marathi, Sanskrit, Telugu and Persian. Among the tutors were some of the finest minds of the day, many from Oxford and Cambridge, with lavish annual salaries as much as £500.

The college was customarily referred to as &quot;Haileybury&quot; in contemporary accounts, debates in the House of Lords and the House of Commons and by the administrators of the East India Company and the Colonial Civil Service. From 1839 the college had a journal known as the &quot;Haileybury Observer&quot;.

The East India Company itself was seen as too powerful. There was pressure for meritocracy to replace recruitment by patronage. Figures such as Benjamin Jowett of Balliol College pressed government ministers to break Haileybury&#x27;s monopoly on Indian Civil Service training and to privilege graduates of the universities instead. In 1855, Parliament passed an act &quot;to relieve the East India Company from the obligation to maintain the College at Haileybury&quot;. King&#x27;s College, London, hosted the first open competitive examinations for appointment to the Indian Civil Service.

==Closure and later use of buildings==
In the aftermath of the Indian Mutiny of 1857, and in anticipation of the winding-up of the affairs of the East India Company itself, the college was closed in January 1858. This left the puzzle of what to do with the imposing buildings. For a brief period, they became a military depot for troops destined for India, and during this interregnum the college&#x27;s Master, Henry Melvill, and Registrar, the Reverend James William Lucas Heaviside, continued to live in their residences on the site and oversaw the maintenance of the buildings. In 1861, the estate was sold at public auction, when it was bought by the British Land Company for £15,000 (equivalent to £ in ).

A Hertford publisher, Stephen Austin, who had been the official printer to the East India Company’s College and had thus become one of the leading printers of books in various Oriental languages, led a campaign to ensure the buildings were returned to some sort of academic purpose, and in 1862 the site reopened as the public school Haileybury College. This was formally constituted by a royal charter dated 30 August 1864. During the Victorian era, the difference between the two periods of education on the site was referred to as &quot;Old Haileybury&quot; and &quot;New Haileybury&quot;.

In its early years, the new Haileybury College retained close links to those involved in colonial administration, and in 1942 it merged with the struggling Imperial Service College to become Haileybury and Imperial Service College.

<text>Jack William Nicklaus (; born January 21, 1940), nicknamed &quot;the Golden Bear&quot;, is an American retired professional golfer and golf course designer. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest golfers of all time. He won 117 professional tournaments in his career. Over a quarter-century, he won a record 18 major championships, three more than second-placed Tiger Woods. Nicklaus focused on the major championships—the Masters Tournament, U.S. Open, Open Championship and PGA Championship—and played a selective schedule of regular PGA Tour events. He competed in 164 major tournaments, more than any other player, and finished with 73 PGA Tour victories, third behind Sam Snead (82) and Woods (82).

Nicklaus won the U.S. Amateur in 1959 and 1961 and finished second in the 1960 U.S. Open, two shots behind Arnold Palmer. Nicklaus turned professional at age 21 in 1961. He earned his first professional victory at the 1962 U.S. Open, defeating Palmer by three shots in a next-day 18-hole playoff and launching a rivalry between the golf superstars. In 1966, Nicklaus became the first player to win the Masters Tournament two years running; he also won The Open Championship, becoming at age 26 the youngest player to win all four golf majors. He won another Open Championship in 1970.

Between 1971 and 1980, Nicklaus won nine more major championships, overtook Bobby Jones’ record of 13 majors, and became the first player to complete double and triple career grand slams. He won the 1986 Masters, his 18th and final major championship at age 46, the tournament&#x27;s oldest winner. Nicklaus joined the Senior PGA Tour (now known as the PGA Tour Champions) when he became eligible in January 1990, and by April 1996 had won 10 tournaments, including eight major championships despite playing a very limited schedule. He continued to play at least some of the four regular Tour majors until 2005 when he made his final appearances at the Masters Tournament and The Open Championship.

Today, Nicklaus heads Nicklaus Design, one of the world&#x27;s largest golf course design and construction companies. Nicklaus runs an event on the PGA Tour, the Memorial Tournament, named after the annual honoring it bestows to individuals associated with the game of golf. Nicklaus&#x27;s books vary from instructional to autobiographical, with his &quot;Golf My Way&quot; considered one of the best instructional golf books of all time; the video of the same name is the best-selling golf instructional to date.

==Early life and amateur golf pursuits==
Nicklaus was born on January 21, 1940, in Columbus, Ohio and grew up in the suburb of Upper Arlington. He is of German descent, the son of Helen (Schoener) and Charlie Nicklaus, a pharmacist who ran several businesses named Nicklaus Drug Store. Charlie was a skilled all-round athlete who had played football for the Ohio State Buckeyes and had gone on to play semi-professional football under an assumed name for the Portsmouth Spartans (who later became the NFL&#x27;s Detroit Lions). Charlie had also been a scratch golfer and local tennis champion in his youth. In February 1970, Charlie Nicklaus died of pancreatic cancer at age fifty-six.

Nicklaus attended Upper Arlington High School, whose nickname and mascot are coincidentally the Golden Bears. In Nicklaus&#x27;s senior year, he was an honorable mention All-Ohio selection in basketball as a shooting guard, and he received some recruiting interest from college basketball programs, including Ohio State. During his youth, he also competed successfully in football, baseball, tennis, and track and field.

Nicklaus took up golf at the age of 10, scoring a 51 at Scioto Country Club for his first nine holes ever played. Charlie Nicklaus had joined Scioto that same year, returning to golf to help heal a volleyball injury. He was coached at Scioto by club pro Jack Grout, a Texas-developed contemporary of golf greats Byron Nelson and Ben Hogan; Grout had played quite successfully on the PGA Tour and would become Nicklaus&#x27;s lifelong golf instructor. Nicklaus overcame a mild case of polio as a 13-year-old.

Nicklaus won the first of five straight Ohio State Junior titles at the age of 12. At 13, he broke 70 at Scioto Country Club for the first time, and became that year&#x27;s youngest qualifier into the U.S. Junior Amateur, where he survived three match-play rounds. He had earned a handicap of +3 at age 13, the lowest in the Columbus area. Nicklaus won the Tri-State High School Championship (Ohio/Kentucky/Indiana) at the age of 14 with a round of 68, and also recorded his first hole-in-one in tournament play the same year. At 15, Nicklaus shot a 66 at Scioto Country Club, which was the amateur course record, and qualified for his first U.S. Amateur. He won the Ohio Open in 1956 at age 16, highlighted by a phenomenal third round of 64, competing against professionals. In all, Nicklaus won 27 events in the Ohio area from age 10 to age 17.

In 1957, Nicklaus won the International Jaycee Junior Golf Tournament, having lost the previous year in a playoff. Nicklaus also competed in his first of 44 consecutive U.S. Opens that year, but missed the cut. In 1958 at age 18, he competed in his first PGA Tour event, the Rubber City Open, at Akron, Ohio, tying for 12th place after being just one out of the lead at the 36-hole mark, and made the cut in the U.S. Open, tying for 41st place. Nicklaus also won two Trans-Mississippi Amateurs – in 1958 at Prairie Dunes Country Club and 1959 at Woodhill Country Club, with final match victories of 9 &amp; 8 and 3 &amp; 2, respectively. Also in 1959, Nicklaus won the North and South Amateur at Pinehurst, North Carolina and competed in three additional PGA Tour events, with his best finish being another 12th place showing at the Buick Open.

While attending Ohio State, he won the U.S. Amateur twice (1959, 1961), and an NCAA Championship (1961). In the 1959 U.S. Amateur, Nicklaus defeated two-time winner and defending champion Charles Coe 1-up in the final 36-hole match when he birdied the 18th hole. This was significant not only because of Coe&#x27;s proven ability as a player, but also because Nicklaus became the then-youngest champion in the modern era, second only to Robert A. Gardner, who won in 1909. In 1961, Nicklaus became the first player to win the individual title at the NCAA Championship and the U.S. Amateur in the same year. He was followed by Phil Mickelson (1990), Tiger Woods (1996), Ryan Moore (2004), and Bryson DeChambeau (2015). Nicklaus also won the NCAA Big Ten Conference Championship that year with a 72-hole aggregate of 283, while earlier claiming the Western Amateur in New Orleans. In his second and last U.S. Amateur win in 1961, Nicklaus convincingly defeated Dudley Wysong 8 &amp; 6 at Pebble Beach in the 36-hole championship match. For the week, Nicklaus was 20 strokes under par, including 34 birdies and two eagles.

At the 1960 U.S. Open, twenty-year-old Nicklaus shot a two-under-par 282, finishing in second place two strokes behind winner Arnold Palmer. This score remained the lowest ever by an amateur in the U.S. Open, until Viktor Hovland beat the record in 2019. Nicklaus played the final 36 holes with Ben Hogan, who later remarked that he had just played 36 holes with a kid who should have won by 10 shots. During the final 36 holes, Nicklaus was two-under-par; he had shot every round of the tournament at or below par and was the only entrant to do so. Nicklaus had led by two shots with six holes to play. In 1960, Nicklaus also tied for 13th in the Masters Tournament. He tied for fourth in the 1961 U.S. Open, three shots behind champion Gene Littler, having played the final 54 holes one under par. Each of these three major championship finishes designated Nicklaus as low amateur. However, Nicklaus&#x27;s one-under-par 287 tied for seventh in the 1961 Masters Tournament, and was second that year only to Charles Coe&#x27;s low amateur placing, when he tied for second with Arnold Palmer at seven-under-par 281, one shot behind champion Gary Player.

Nicklaus represented the United States against Great Britain and Ireland on winning Walker Cup teams in both 1959 and 1961, decisively winning both of his matches in each contest. On the 1959 trip to Britain, he also made his only attempt at the British Amateur, the world&#x27;s oldest international amateur event, at Royal St George&#x27;s Golf Club, losing 4 &amp; 3 in the quarterfinal round to fellow-American, Bill Hyndman. He was also a member of the victorious 1960 U.S. Eisenhower Trophy team, winning the unofficial individual title by 13 shots over teammate Deane Beman with a four-round score of 269 at Merion Golf Club, a record which still stands; this score was 18 shots lower than Ben Hogan&#x27;s earlier U.S. Open aggregate of 287 at the same site (which had, however, been scored under much tougher conditions). For three straight years (1959–1961), Nicklaus was named the world&#x27;s top amateur golfer by &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine.

===College studies and marriage===
Nicklaus attended Ohio State University from 1957 to 1961. He majored in pre-pharmacy and had good grades in his first three years; he intended to follow his father into pharmacy after graduation. As his amateur golf achievements mounted, Nicklaus changed his mind on his career path; he switched programs to study insurance. At that stage, he planned to remain an amateur golfer and earn his living by selling insurance. For a time, he worked in the insurance field while he also attended college. He married Barbara Bash (b. 1940), who was a nursing student at Ohio State, in July 1960, and their first of five children, Jack Jr., was born in September 1961. The following month, Nicklaus was intent on becoming the first amateur to win the Masters. In early November, he changed his mind and announced that he was turning professional in order to support his family. He wound up a few course hours short of graduating from college. In a goodwill gesture, Ohio State granted him an honorary doctorate in 1972.

==PGA Tour career==

===Professional breakthrough: 1962–1963===
Nicklaus officially turned professional in late 1961 and began his career on the PGA Tour the following year. He had previously debated the idea of remaining an amateur in order to further emulate his idol, Bobby Jones. However, Nicklaus realized that in order to be regarded as the best, he would have to compete in greater frequency against the best. Shortly after turning professional, Nicklaus&#x27;s future agent, Mark McCormack, was interviewed by &quot;Melbourne Age&quot; writer Don Lawrence, who inquired about the American golf scene. When McCormack described Nicklaus, Lawrence referred to the &quot;large, strong, and blond&quot; player as &quot;the Golden Bear&quot;, a nickname that would become synonymous with Nicklaus throughout his professional life. However, another possible origination of the name derives from the high school that Nicklaus attended in Upper Arlington, Ohio, which uses the mascot the Golden Bears for its sports teams. As mentioned above, Nicklaus played on several Golden Bears athletic teams, including captaining its 1956 state-champion golf squad, suggesting that McCormack may have adopted the name through Nicklaus&#x27;s high school affiliation. Regardless, by 1963, the nickname had stuck.

Nicklaus won his first PGA tournament in his 17th start. He and Arnold Palmer were tied for the lead at 1962 U.S. Open at Oakmont after Rounds 3 and 4 were played on Saturday. Nicklaus won the Sunday 18-hole playoff and earned $17,500 ($15,000 plus the $2,500 playoff bonus)—far behind Gary Woodland&#x27;s $2,250,000 check for the 2019 U.S. Open—for his efforts. The galleries were more vocal in their support for Palmer—who had grown up in nearby Latrobe—but Nicklaus won the playoff by three shots (71 to 74). In 90 holes, Nicklaus had only one three-putt green. The U.S. Open victory made Nicklaus the reigning U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur champion. This major championship win was also his first PGA Tour win. In addition, Nicklaus (22) was the youngest U.S. Open champion since Bobby Jones won at age 21 in 1923, and remained the youngest winner until Jordan Spieth won the 2015 U.S. Open at age 21. (John McDermott is still the youngest winner of the U.S. Open at age 19 in 1911). The U.S. Open win thrust Nicklaus into the national spotlight, and he was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. This was also the beginning of the Nicklaus-Palmer rivalry, which attracted viewers to golf on television.

By the end of 1962, Nicklaus had won two more tournaments, which were back-to-back in the Seattle Open and Portland Open. In addition, he tied for third in his first appearance in the PGA Championship. Nicklaus completed the year with over $60,000 () in prize money, made 26 of 26 cuts with 16 top-10 finishes, placed third on the PGA Tour money list, and was named Rookie of the Year. He also won the inaugural staging of the World Series of Golf, a select-field event for the year&#x27;s major champions, and collected another $50,000 () in unofficial money for that win.

In 1963, Nicklaus won two of the four majors—the Masters and the PGA Championship. These victories made him the then-youngest winner of the Masters and third-youngest winner of the PGA Championship, and each win came in just his second year as a professional. Along with three other wins including the Tournament of Champions, he placed second to Arnold Palmer on the PGA Tour money list with just over $100,000 (). He also teamed with Palmer to win the Canada Cup (now the World Cup of Golf) in France, representing the United States (this event was shortened to 63 holes due to heavy fog). Nicklaus also finished as low individual scorer for that event.

====Business success====
Nicklaus&#x27;s meteoric rise to fame immediately after turning professional enabled opportunities for him to earn significant endorsement income. These business opportunities were facilitated by Mark McCormack, who also managed Palmer and Gary Player. Golf was growing rapidly in popularity and media coverage during the early 1960s, led by the performances of these three star players. This association was the start of the agency that became known as International Management Group, and IMG, after building a base in golf management, eventually expanded into other sports. The Palmer-Nicklaus-Player rivalry developed into the so-called &quot;Big Three&quot; of Golf. In the early 1960s, McCormack set up a series of televised golf matches around the world among the three stars, known as Big Three Golf. In the early 1970s, Nicklaus left IMG to set up his own management agency, Golden Bear Inc. Nicklaus also signed a contract with Eastern Airlines. He could be seen on TV saying, &quot;If you play golf, Eastern is your airline.&quot;

===Continued excellence: 1964–1967===
Despite winning no majors in 1964 (he had three runner-up finishes), Nicklaus led the PGA Tour money list for the first time in his career by a slim margin of $81.13 over Palmer. At The Open Championship at St Andrews, Nicklaus set a new record for the lowest score in the final 36 holes with 66–68 in high winds (the first time in the championship&#x27;s history that 70 had been broken in each of the last two rounds). This was not enough, however, to win the event; Nicklaus placed second to Tony Lema. Nicklaus also set a record for the lowest final-round score in the PGA Championship with a 64 (since broken by Brad Faxon in 1995 with a 63), but fell three shots short of champion Bobby Nichols and his record-setting score of 271. In 31 official worldwide events in 1964, Nicklaus achieved six victories, seven runners-up, placed in the top five 21 times, the top-10 21 times, and had only one missed cut. Nicklaus and Palmer also defended their team title at the World Cup in Hawaii, with Nicklaus again finishing as low individual scorer.

When Nicklaus won the Masters Tournament in 1965 and 1966, he became the tournament&#x27;s first back-to-back winner and the youngest two-time and three-time winner. He broke Ben Hogan&#x27;s 72-hole scoring record of 274 in 1953 when he compiled a new aggregate of 271 in the 1965 Masters. This record was tied by Raymond Floyd in 1976 and lasted until Tiger Woods shot 270 in 1997, which was a 72-hole record that was subsequently tied by Jordan Spieth in 2015. When Woods and Spieth shot 270, the scores were achieved with significantly improved golf equipment on essentially the same-length golf course over which Nicklaus and Floyd shot 271. During the 1965 tournament, Nicklaus hit 62 of 72 greens in regulation and had 123 putts, inclusive of just one three-putt green. This was good enough to win by nine shots over Arnold Palmer and Gary Player; this margin of victory was a tournament record that would last for 32 years until Woods won by 12 shots in 1997. The week&#x27;s performance was highlighted by a third-round 64 that consisted of eight birdies and no bogeys. It was of this round that Nicklaus said, &quot;I had never before and have never since played quite as fine a complete round of golf in a major championship as I did in the third round of the 1965 Masters.&quot; This round tied Lloyd Mangrum&#x27;s record set at Augusta National in 1940 and remained in place until Nick Price shot 63 during the third round in 1986. It was at this time that Bobby Jones stated Nicklaus played a game with which he was unfamiliar; Jones called Nicklaus&#x27;s result &quot;the greatest performance in all of golfing history&quot;.

After Nicklaus&#x27;s record performance at Augusta National in 1965, the course underwent some minor changes to make it tougher. These modifications and the difficult weather in the 1966 tournament did not deter Nicklaus. He successfully defended his title with an even-par aggregate of 288, 17 shots higher. He won in an 18-hole playoff over Gay Brewer (Brewer had three-putted the 18th green to force the playoff but he redeemed himself the following year by winning the tournament) and Tommy Jacobs by shooting a two-under-par 70. Nicklaus led the PGA Tour money list again in 1965 by a healthy margin over Tony Lema. Nicklaus and Lema formed the U.S. team for the World Cup, held in Madrid, Spain, but could not defend the title, as South Africa won. In all, Nicklaus competed in 28 official worldwide events in 1965, accumulating five victories, seven runners-up, 19 top-5 finishes, 23 top-10 finishes, and zero missed cuts.

In 1966, Nicklaus also won The Open Championship at Muirfield in Scotland under difficult weather conditions; he used his driver just 17 times because of very heavy rough. This was the only major he had failed to win up to that point. This win made him the youngest player, age 26 (his fifth year on Tour), and the only one after Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, and Gary Player (until Tiger Woods at age 24 in 2000, also during his fifth year on Tour) to win all four major championships, now known as the Career Grand Slam. Nicklaus eventually accomplished the double career grand slam in 1971 and the triple career grand slam in 1978, winning all four majors two and three times, respectively. Nicklaus was part of another title for the U.S. in the World Cup in Japan. Nicklaus concluded 1966 playing 22 official worldwide events, with four victories, four runners-up, 14 top-5 finishes, 16 top-10 finishes, and zero missed cuts.

In 1967, Nicklaus won the U.S. Open for a second time. The tournament was held at Baltusrol, and he broke Hogan&#x27;s 72-hole record by one shot with a 275 when he birdied the par 5 18th hole. During the four rounds, Nicklaus hit 61 of 72 greens in regulation. Nicklaus finished this record win with a dramatic 238-yard 1-iron shot, uphill into a breeze and light rain, to the 72nd green (an approximate 260-yard equivalent) and holing out a birdie putt to close out a final nine of 30 and final round of 65 to shoot 275, four shots better than runner-up Arnold Palmer. Nicklaus and Palmer were the only two players to break par for the week. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ran a cover photo of Nicklaus throwing his leg high in the air with the headline, &quot;Nicklaus Breaks the Open Record&quot;. He also finished runner up in The Open Championship and third in the PGA Championship, one shot out of a playoff between Don January and Don Massengale. In 1967, Nicklaus led the PGA Tour money list for the third time. Later that year, Nicklaus and Palmer teamed up for a 13-shot wire-to-wire World Cup victory in Mexico City. Nicklaus competed in 24 official worldwide events in 1967, with five victories, four runners-up, 14 top-5 finishes, 16 top-10 finishes, and one missed cut. For most of his professional career, Nicklaus employed Angelo Argea as his caddie.

===Career downturn (1968–1970)===
After Nicklaus won the 1967 U.S. Open in record-breaking fashion, he did not win another major championship until the 1970 Open Championship at the Old Course at St Andrews. Moreover, his highest finish on the Tour money list for the years 1968–70 was second; his lowest was fourth, his worst ranking on the list since turning professional. However, his fourth-place ranking in 1970 would have been elevated to second if The Open Championship winnings were included during that period in the official PGA Tour money list, as they are today. Nicklaus finished runner-up in both the 1968 U.S. Open (to new rival Lee Trevino) and the 1968 Open Championship (to old rival Gary Player).

Nicklaus made his inaugural appearance in the 1969 Ryder Cup at age 29; eligibility rules at the time required a minimum five-year PGA Tour membership before points could be counted for team qualification; rules have been relaxed significantly since. In the 1969 Ryder Cup, the entire competition came down to the anchor singles match between Nicklaus and Tony Jacklin. At the par-5 17th hole with Nicklaus leading by the score of 1 up, Jacklin made a eagle putt to square the match. With the entire competition outcome riding on this match, Nicklaus made a five-foot par putt on the last hole before controversially conceding Jacklin&#x27;s par putt, ensuring that this game, and the overall match, ended in a tie. Afterwards United States team Captain Sam Snead said &quot;This is the greatest golf match you have ever seen in England.&quot;

During this period, Nicklaus&#x27;s physical condition declined somewhat; he put on some excess weight, which affected his stamina. Following the Ryder Cup, he significantly improved his condition in the fall of 1969 by losing in one month, and his game started to return to top form. In February 1970, Nicklaus&#x27;s father, Charlie Nicklaus, died of pancreatic cancer at age 56. Five months after this, Nicklaus won the 1970 Open Championship under difficult scoring conditions in Scotland where the wind howled up to , defeating fellow American Doug Sanders in an 18-hole playoff round in emotional fashion. On the 18th hole of the playoff, Nicklaus drove about 380 yards, through the par-4 green with a three-wood, and was forced to pitch back to the hole. His eagle pitch finished approximately eight feet short of the hole. Nicklaus threw his putter into the air after sinking the winning putt, as he was thrilled to have won the Open at the home of golf, St Andrews. He describes this period in his life:
I was playing good golf, but it really wasn&#x27;t that big a deal to me one way or the other. And then my father died and I sort of realized that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn&#x27;t probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got myself back to work. So &#x27;70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint. ... It was a big boost.
Nicklaus also went on to capture the Piccadilly World Match Play Championship in 1970 with a 2 &amp; 1 win over Lee Trevino in the championship match. In all for the year, Nicklaus competed in 23 official worldwide events, won four, placed in the top-5 10 times, and the top-10 in 14.

Although Nicklaus&#x27;s performance had declined somewhat during this period, he was still ranked as the No. 1 player in the world, for 10 straight years, beginning in 1968, on the McCormack&#x27;s World Golf Rankings, which were introduced that year by sports agent Mark McCormack. These rankings, the first attempt to take into account results from professional tours around the world, were not official during that era, but they eventually evolved into the current Official World Golf Ranking, starting in 1986.

===Resurgence (1971–1977)===
With his victory in the 1971 PGA Championship, Nicklaus became the first golfer to win all four majors twice. In this championship, Nicklaus was the only player to break 70 consecutively in the first two rounds under windy conditions; he finished at seven-under-par 281. Nicklaus finished second twice and fifth in the remaining three major championships for the year. While he finished tied for second in the Masters with Johnny Miller, Nicklaus made a big enough impression on a young Nick Faldo (watching on TV in England) in order for Faldo to take up the game seriously.

By the end of 1971, Nicklaus had won four additional PGA tournaments including the Tournament of Champions by eight shots and the National Team Championship with Arnold Palmer by six shots. With $244,490 in official PGA Tour earnings, Nicklaus established a new single-season money record during the year. Nicklaus also claimed his third World Cup individual title in 1971, with help from a 63 in the third round. He also won the team competition with partner Lee Trevino by 12 shots. The year 1971 brought Nicklaus a victory in the Australian Dunlop International as well, punctuated by a course record 62 (his career-low score in competition; one of three) in the second round. For the record, Nicklaus played in 23 official worldwide events in 1971, won eight, had 17 top-5 finishes, 20 top-10 finishes, and compiled a 5–1–0 record in that year&#x27;s Ryder Cup competition.

Nicklaus won the first two major championships of 1972 by three shots each in wire-to-wire fashion. He won the Masters and the U.S. Open, creating talk of a calendar-year Grand Slam. Nicklaus opened with a four-under-par 68 at Augusta National and never looked back. He was the only player under par for the week as he and the field battled difficult scoring conditions. In the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach again under severe scoring conditions, Nicklaus struck a one-iron on the 218-yard par-three 17th hole during the final round into a stiff, gusty ocean breeze that hit the flagstick and ended up three inches from the cup. The U.S. Open was Nicklaus&#x27;s 13th career major and tied him with Bobby Jones for career majors (although a different group of tournaments had been considered majors in Jones&#x27;s time). This victory was also Nicklaus&#x27;s 11th professional major, tying him with Walter Hagen, and made him the first player to win the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Open championships on the same golf course.

During the 1972 PGA Tour season, Nicklaus won seven tournaments and was runner-up in three events. However, Nicklaus did not win the Grand Slam that year, as Lee Trevino repeated as the Open Championship winner (Nicklaus finished second, one shot behind), and Gary Player prevailed in the PGA Championship. Nicklaus closed out this remarkable year with a second of three consecutive Walt Disney World Golf Classic victories by shooting a 21-under-par 267 to win by nine shots. He concluded 1972 by competing in 20 official worldwide events winning seven, placing second in four, and compiling 15 top-10 finishes.

Bobby Jones&#x27;s record of majors was soon broken when Nicklaus won the PGA Championship in August 1973 by four shots over Bruce Crampton for his 12th professional major (surpassing Hagen&#x27;s mark of 11) and 14th overall when using the old-style configuration of Jones&#x27;s day. In that year he won another six tournaments. When he won the 1973 Ohio Kings Island Open, he became the first PGA Tour player to win a Tour event on a course that he designed himself. The PGA Player of the Year was awarded to Nicklaus for the third time, and the second year in a row. Nicklaus was also the first player to win over $300,000.00 in official money for a single season in 1972 at $320,542; he eclipsed that threshold again the following year with $308,362. The former total was $106,137 more than runner-up Lee Trevino. The latter total for the year 1973 catapulted Nicklaus over the $2 million career PGA Tour earnings mark, making him the first player to reach that milestone. Nicklaus teamed with Johnny Miller for another team title in the World Cup of Golf, held in Spain. For the year, Nicklaus competed in 20 official worldwide events and claimed seven victories, 14 top-five finishes, 17 top-10s, and compiled a 4–1–1 record in that year&#x27;s Ryder Cup competition.

Nicklaus&#x27;s failure to win a major in 1974 was somewhat offset when he won the inaugural Tournament Players Championship and was named one of the 13 original inductees into the World Golf Hall of Fame. Nicklaus said this honor was a &quot;nice memento&quot; after a &quot;disappointing season&quot;. Although he had no major championship victories in 1974, Nicklaus still achieved four top-10 finishes in the four events, three of which were in the top four, and placed second on the official money list behind Johnny Miller. While less than a stellar year, Nicklaus was able to claim two victories and 13 top-10 finishes in 20 official worldwide events.

Nicklaus started off well in 1975: he won the Doral-Eastern Open, the Sea Pines Heritage Classic, and the Masters in consecutive starts. His Masters win was his fifth, a record he was to break eleven years later. In this tournament, Nicklaus&#x27;s birdie putt on the 16th hole of the final round was a key in his victory over Tom Weiskopf and Johnny Miller in a riveting final-round battle. He also won the PGA Championship in August at Firestone Country Club by two shots over Bruce Crampton for his fourth win. Having won the Masters and PGA Championship, Nicklaus missed a playoff for the U.S. Open by two shots and a playoff for Open Championship by one shot. His performance in 1975 resulted in his being named PGA Player of the Year for the fourth time, tying Ben Hogan, and he was also named ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year. Nicklaus also captured his fourth Australian Open during the year. The year 1975 yielded Nicklaus six wins, 12 top-5 finishes, and 16 top-10 finishes in 18 official worldwide events.

Nicklaus placed first on the PGA Tour money list again in 1976, despite competing in only 16 events, winning just two (Tournament Players Championship and World Series of Golf) – neither of them majors – and playing what he called &quot;hang-back-and-hope golf&quot;. The 1976 Tournament Players Championship saw Nicklaus set a championship record of 19-under-par 269 for his second win in this event which remained in place until Greg Norman&#x27;s 24-under-par 264 assault in 1994. He also won the PGA Player of the Year award for a record fifth time. Between 1972 and 1976 the only time he failed to win this award was 1974. The year 1976 also concluded an official streak of 105 consecutive cuts made on the PGA Tour (ending at the World Open), which began for Nicklaus in 1970. At the time this streak was second only to Byron Nelson&#x27;s record of 113.
The following year, 1977, was also majorless for Nicklaus, but he did achieve four top-10 finishes in the four events inclusive of two second and one third-place finish – this being one shot out of the PGA Championship playoff between Lanny Wadkins and Gene Littler. Despite a brilliant final round 66 at the Masters, he finished second by two shots to Tom Watson. But his subsequent second-place finish behind Watson at the Open Championship at Turnberry created headlines around the world. In a one-on-one battle dubbed the &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot;, Nicklaus shot 65–66 in the final two rounds, only to be beaten by Watson, who scored 65-65. This event marked the first time 270 was broken in a major championship, and the third-place finisher Hubert Green scored 279. Nicklaus would later say:
There are those in golf who would argue into next month that the final two rounds of the 1977 British Open were the greatest head-to-head golf match ever played. Not having been around for the first five hundred or so years of the game, I&#x27;m not qualified to speak on such matters. What&#x27;s for sure, however, is that it was the most thrilling one-on-one battle of my career.

In 1977, Nicklaus won his 63rd tour event, passing Ben Hogan to take second place on the career wins list, behind only Sam Snead (subsequently Hogan&#x27;s official career PGA Tour victory total was put at 64, including his 1953 Open Championship which was retroactively deemed an official PGA Tour event). He also became the first player to amass over $3 million in official PGA Tour earnings. The year also saw Nicklaus win for the first time his own Memorial Tournament, where he described the victory as the most emotional moment of his entire career, and nearly decided to retire from competitive golf.

====Proposes Ryder Cup modifications====
During the 1977 Ryder Cup at Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes, Nicklaus approached the PGA of Great Britain about the urgency to improve the competitive level of the contest. The issue had been discussed earlier the same day by both past PGA of America President Henry Poe and British PGA President Lord Derby. Nicklaus pitched his ideas, adding: &quot;It is vital to widen the selection procedures if the Ryder Cup is to continue to enjoy its past prestige.&quot; The changes in team selection procedure were approved by descendants of the Samuel Ryder family, along with The PGA of America. The major change was expanding selection procedures to include players from the European Tournament Players&#x27; Division, and &quot;that European Members be entitled to play on the team&quot;. This meant that professional players on the European Tournament Players&#x27; Division, the forerunner to the European Tour we have today, from continental Europe would be eligible to play in the Ryder Cup.

====Achieves triple career grand slam (1978)====
When Nicklaus won the 1978 Open Championship at St. Andrews, he became the only player to win each major championship three times. This record was tied by Tiger Woods when he won the 2008 U.S. Open. Nicklaus and Woods are the only two players to win three &quot;Career Grand Slams&quot;. Nicklaus considered his performance in the 1978 Open as the finest four days of tee-to-green golf he had ever produced, and was most proud that the win came at St. Andrews, his favorite place to play golf. The victory was also his most emotional to date.

Nicklaus won three other tournaments on the PGA Tour in 1978. One of those wins came in the Jackie Gleason-Inverrary Classic, where he played the final 36 holes 13 under par and scored five consecutive birdies over the closing holes in the final round. He also won his third Tournament Players Championship in difficult weather conditions; he had won three of the first five stagings of that tournament, and he remains the championship&#x27;s only three-time winner. He was named Sportsman of the Year by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. The year 1978 also marked Nicklaus&#x27;s sixth and final Australian Open victory.

===Short slump and revamping===
In 1979, Nicklaus suffered a lapse of form and did not win a tournament. This was the first year in his professional career in which he failed to win a PGA Tour event. He did, however, come close. Playing well ahead of the last group on a windy day in the final round of the 1979 Masters he was 8-under through 16 holes but bogeyed 17 and parred 18 to finish 7-under. The ensuing 3-man playoff between Ed Sneed, Tom Watson and Fuzzy Zoeller (who won the playoff) took place at 8-under after Sneed bogeyed the last three. Jack also finished in a tie for second with Ben Crenshaw behind 22-year-old Seve Ballesteros at The Open Championship. He would not win another tournament until June 1980. Previously, Nicklaus won at least one PGA Tour tournament per year (a record he shares with Arnold Palmer), and a minimum of two tournaments per year for 17 consecutive years, and this is another PGA Tour record.

During the offseason, Nicklaus addressed two problems that had hurt his performance. His lifelong teacher Jack Grout noticed that he had become much too upright with his full swing, which caused a steep, oblique approach into the ball, compared with a more direct hit; this was corrected by slightly flattening his backswing. Then Nicklaus&#x27;s short game, never a career strength, was further developed with the help of Phil Rodgers, a friend for more than 20 years, and earlier PGA Tour rival, who had become a fine coach. Rodgers lived for a time at the Nicklaus home while this work was going on.

===Wins fourth U.S. Open, fifth PGA Championship (1980)===
In 1980, Nicklaus recorded only four top-10 finishes in 14 events, but two of these were record-setting victories in majors (the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship); the other two were a tie for fourth in The Open Championship and a runner-up finish in the Doral-Eastern Open to Raymond Floyd via his chip-in birdie on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff.

Nicklaus set a new scoring record for the 1980 U.S. Open with an aggregate of 272, eclipsing his earlier record of 275 from 1967 over the same golf course. That record, while since having been tied by three other players, stood until Rory McIlroy&#x27;s 268 in winning the 2011 U.S. Open. This was Nicklaus&#x27;s second major win at Baltusrol Golf Club. Nicklaus opened with a record-tying 63 in round one and fought off his playing partner of all four rounds, 1978 Colgate World Match Play Championship winner, Isao Aoki. Entering the final round, Aoki had caught Nicklaus after three consecutive rounds of 68, but over the course of the last day, Nicklaus pulled away by two shots. Each player birdied the final two holes for a dramatic finish. Aoki&#x27;s aggregate of 274 was the lowest score for a U.S. Open runner-up. Nicklaus&#x27;s win was his fourth and final victory in the championship, tying him with Willie Anderson, Bobby Jones, and Ben Hogan. Nicklaus referred to this win as &quot;by far the most emotional and warmest reaction to any of my wins in my own country&quot;.

In the 1980 PGA Championship, Nicklaus set another record when he won the tournament by seven shots over Andy Bean at the Oak Hill Country Club; the win was largely due to exceptional putting. Nicklaus shot an even-par 70 in the first round. This was followed by three successive rounds in the 60s over the difficult course, and he was the only player to break par for 72 holes. For the week, the field averaged 74.60 strokes while Nicklaus averaged 68.50. This was Nicklaus&#x27;s fifth and final victory in the PGA Championship, which elevated him to record-holder for the most wins in the stroke-play era, and which tied him with Walter Hagen for the most wins overall, since Hagen&#x27;s victories were all during the match-play era. Nicklaus&#x27;s seven-shot winning margin remained the largest for the stroke-play version of the championship until Rory McIlroy&#x27;s 2012 victory. This victory also made Nicklaus the only player since Gene Sarazen in 1922 and Ben Hogan in 1948 to win the U.S. Open and PGA Championship the same year (subsequently equaled by Tiger Woods in 2000 and Brooks Koepka in 2018).

===1981–1985===
Between 1981 and 1985, Nicklaus accumulated seven more top-10 placements in major championships, including three runner-up performances. He won only twice on the PGA Tour during this period, the Colonial National Invitation in 1982 and his own Memorial Tournament in 1984 for the second time, defeating Andy Bean in a sudden-death playoff to become the tournament&#x27;s first two-time champion.

In 1983, Nicklaus closed out the PGA Championship and World Series of Golf with brilliant final rounds in the mid-60s, and passed many players to move into contention, but finished runner-up in each to Player of the Year Hal Sutton and Nick Price, respectively, who dominated the tournaments from start to finish. Despite not winning a PGA Tour event in 1983, Nicklaus finished 10th on the PGA Tour money list, and passed a significant milestone by becoming the first player to eclipse the $4 million level in career earnings.

In 1985, Nicklaus finished second to Curtis Strange in the Canadian Open, which marked his seventh and final second-place finish in that tournament; this is a record for that event. These seven runner-up finishes came over the course of 21 events—or one second-place finish for every three tournaments played—and does not include a third-place finish in 1983, one shot out of the playoff between John Cook and Johnny Miller.

During the five-year period between 1981 and 1985, the Ryder Cup matches provided Nicklaus with two bright spots. He completed his competition as a player in style by contributing a perfect 4–0–0 record (inclusive of a 5 &amp; 3 anchor singles match win over Eamonn Darcy) in 1981, and captained the United States team in 1983 to a one-point win over Europe.

===Wins sixth Masters at age 46 (1986)===
In 1986, Nicklaus capped his victories in major championships by winning his sixth Masters title under challenging circumstances; he posted a six-under-par 30 on the back nine for a final round of seven-under-par 65. At the 17th hole, Nicklaus hit his second shot to within and rolled it in for birdie; he raised his putter in celebration and completed an eagle-birdie-birdie run. Nicklaus made a solid par-4 at the 72nd hole, and waited for the succeeding players, several of whom (Tom Kite, Greg Norman) were still in contention, to fall short. Nicklaus played the final ten holes seven under par, with six birdies and an eagle. At age 46, Nicklaus became the oldest Masters winner in history, a record that still stands. On the feat, sports columnist Thomas Boswell remarked,
Some things cannot possibly happen, because they are both too improbable and too perfect. The U.S. hockey team cannot beat the Russians in the 1980 Olympics. Jack Nicklaus cannot shoot 65 to win The Masters at age 46. Nothing else comes immediately to mind.
This victory was his 18th and final major title.

This victory was to be his last in his long career on the PGA Tour, and was described at the time by noted golf historian and writer Herbert Warren Wind as &quot;nothing less than the most important accomplishment in golf since Bobby Jones&#x27;s Grand Slam in 1930&quot;.

Author Ken Bowden wrote after the win:
There have been prettier swingers of the club than Jack Nicklaus. There may have been better ball-strikers than Jack Nicklaus. There have definitely been better short-game exponents than Jack Nicklaus. Other golfers have putted as well as Jack Nicklaus. There may have been golfers as dedicated and fiercely competitive as Jack Nicklaus. But no individual has been able to develop, combine and sustain all of the complex physical skills and the immense mental and emotional resources the game demands at its highest level as well as Jack Nicklaus has for as long as he has.
At the 1998 Masters, Nicklaus was 58 when he tied for sixth place despite being hampered by an ever-increasing painful left hip. Nicklaus&#x27;s five-under-par 283 was the lowest 72-hole score in the Masters by a player older than fifty, until Phil Mickelson finished eight-under-par 280 in 2023 at age 52.

During the course of a 25-year span (1962–1986), Nicklaus won 18 major championships and finished second 18 times (excluding the second-place finish at the 1960 U.S. Open as an amateur). He also placed third nine times and fourth seven times in this span and was one stroke out of a playoff on five of those occasions (1963 Open Championship, 1967 PGA Championship, 1975 Open Championship, 1977 PGA Championship, and 1979 Masters Tournament). His total span of 73 top-10 finishes over 39 years (1960–1998) is a record in total number as well as longevity among the four major championships and encompassed his tenure from an amateur through the majority of his Champions Tour career.

==Senior golf career==
Nicklaus became eligible to join the Senior PGA Tour, now known as PGA Tour Champions, when he turned 50 in January 1990, at which point he declared, &quot;I&#x27;m never satisfied. Trouble is, I want to play like me—and I can&#x27;t play like me anymore.&quot; He then quickly won in his first start on the Tour, The Tradition, also a Senior Tour major championship. Nicklaus would go on to win another three Traditions—the final two in succession—while the most anyone else has won is two.

Later in the year, Nicklaus won the Senior Players Championship by six shots over Lee Trevino for his second win of the year, and also his second major of the year by shooting a record 27-under-par 261. The next year, in 1991, Nicklaus won three of the five events he started in, those being the U.S. Senior Open at Oakland Hills by firing a 65 in a playoff against Chi-Chi Rodríguez and his final round of 69, the PGA Seniors Championship and The Tradition for the second year straight. These, again, were all majors on the senior circuit.

Nicklaus has won all the senior majors with the exception of the Senior Open Championship. However, he never played in that event until after he turned 60, and it was only elevated to a major in 2003. After a winless year in 1992, Nicklaus came back to win the U.S. Senior Open for the second time in 1993 by one shot over Tom Weiskopf. Also in that year he teamed up with Chi-Chi Rodríguez and Raymond Floyd to win the Wendy&#x27;s 3-Tour Challenge for the Senior PGA Tour team.

In 1994, Nicklaus won the Senior PGA Tour&#x27;s version of the Mercedes Championship for his only win of the year. The Tradition was his again in 1995, in a year where he made the top 10 in all of the seven tournaments he entered in. His 100th career win came the next year, when he won the Tradition for the fourth time, and second time in succession. He made a double eagle in the final round. Nicklaus closed the final 36 holes with back-to-back seven-under-par rounds of 65 to shoot a 16-under-par 272 and win by three shots over Hale Irwin. This was to be his last win on the Senior PGA Tour, and the last official win of his career.

==Close of playing career==
In 2000, Nicklaus played in his 44th and final U.S. Open. He shot 73-82 and missed the cut at Pebble Beach Golf Links. This was the same tournament where Tiger Woods won his first Open when he outclassed the nearest competitors by a 15-shot margin. During the tournament, after defending champion Payne Stewart had died in an airplane crash the previous October, Nicklaus was given Stewart&#x27;s place in the traditional opening pairings alongside the Open Championship winner (Paul Lawrie) and the U.S. Amateur winner (David Gossett), and Nicklaus asked for a moment of silence in Stewart&#x27;s honor before his opening tee shot.

Later in the year, he was paired with Woods and Vijay Singh in his final PGA Championship, where he missed the cut by one shot only a few days after the death of his 91-year-old mother. In both tournaments, Nicklaus provided last-minute heroics by reaching the par-5 18th in two shots in the U.S. Open and nearly holing his wedge shot for eagle at the par-5 18th in the PGA Championship.

Nicklaus played without much preparation in the 2005 Masters, which was a month after the drowning death of his 17-month-old grandson Jake (child of his son Steve) on March 1, 2005. In a written statement, Nicklaus said that it was impossible to put into words the devastation of his family. Nicklaus later spoke emotionally about the tragedy. He said: &quot;It&#x27;s been an overwhelmingly difficult and trying time for my entire family. The loss of our precious 17-month-old grandson Jake was devastating.&quot; Nicklaus and his son Steve played golf as therapy for their grief following Jake&#x27;s death. After days of playing, Steve suggested his father return to The Masters. He made that his last appearance in the tournament.

Later in 2005, Nicklaus finished his professional career at The Open Championship played at St Andrews on July 15. On St Andrews, Nicklaus stated:
I&#x27;m very sentimental and the place gets to me every time I go there. In May I walked around and welled up with hardly anyone watching me. St Andrews was always where I wanted to finish my major career.
Nicklaus turned 65 in January that year, which was the last year he could enter The Open Championship as an exempt player. He played with Luke Donald and Tom Watson in his final round. After hitting his tee shot off the 18th tee in the second round, Nicklaus received a ten-minute standing ovation from the crowd. On the eighteenth fairway, he gave his final farewell to professional golf while standing on the iconic Swilcan Bridge. Soon afterwards, Nicklaus ended his career with a birdie, holing a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th green. Nicklaus missed the 36-hole cut with a score of +3 (147).

The last competitive tournament in which Nicklaus played in the United States was the Champions Tour&#x27;s Bayer Advantage Classic in Overland Park, Kansas, on June 13, 2005.

One of the most memorable moments in Nicklaus&#x27; career occurred well after his formal retirement from the sport. At the grand opening of a course Nicklaus designed, The Golf Club at Harbor Shores in Benton Harbor, Michigan, in July 2010, Nicklaus played alongside Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, and Johnny Miller in the Harbor Shores Champions for Change Golf Challenge. Miller questioned how anybody could handle a particular severely uphill and sloping putt spanning the entire green. Nicklaus walked over from across the green, asking &quot;Want me to show you how to putt it?&quot; Miller replied, &quot;Show me how to do it&quot; as Nicklaus dropped a ball next to Miller&#x27;s and casually hit the 102-foot putt, which curved uphill and across the green before dropping perfectly into the hole, eliciting cheers.

On April 8, 2015, Nicklaus hit his first-ever hole-in-one at the Augusta National Golf Club at the age of 75 when participating in the Masters&#x27; Par 3 Contest, albeit on the Par 3 Course, while playing with Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw. He hit 20 holes-in-one in professional tournament play at other venues over his career.

==Off-the-course activities==

===Golf course design===
Nicklaus devotes much of his time to golf course design and operates one of the largest golf design practices in the world. In the mid-1960s, Pete Dye initially requested Nicklaus&#x27;s opinion in the architecture process of The Golf Club in suburban Columbus, Ohio, and the input increased from that point forward. Nicklaus considered golf course design another facet of the game that kept him involved and offered a challenge. His first design, Harbour Town Golf Links, co-credited with Dye, was opened for play in 1969. The nine-hole, par-3 golf course of Cheeca Resort &amp; Spa was also designed by Nicklaus in the 1960s. A subsequent early, yet more prominent design was Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, OH which opened in 1974 and has hosted the Memorial Tournament since its inception in 1976. This course has also hosted the 1987 Ryder Cup, the 1998 Solheim Cup matches and the 2013 President&#x27;s Cup. For the first few years, all of his projects were co-designs with either Pete Dye or Desmond Muirhead, who were two of the leading golf course architects of that era.

His first solo design, Glen Abbey Golf Course in Oakville, Ontario, opened for play in 1976. This course served as the host site for the Canadian Open for many years, the first being in 1977. The oldest golf club in the U.S., Saint Andrew&#x27;s Golf Club in New York, was redesigned by Nicklaus in 1983. In 2000, the King &amp; Bear opened in St. Augustine, Florida, as a joint collaboration between Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. In 2006, the Concession Golf Club opened in Sarasota, Florida, as a joint collaboration between him and Tony Jacklin, to commemorate their historic Ryder Cup singles match in 1969.

Nicklaus is in partnership with his four sons and his son-in-law through their company, Nicklaus Design. The company had 299 courses open for play at the end of 2005, which was nearly 1% of all the courses in the world (in 2005, &quot;Golf Digest&quot; calculated that there were nearly 32,000 golf courses in the world, approximately half of them in the United States). While the majority of Nicklaus-designed courses are located in the United States, the company has designed golf courses in Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Europe, and Mexico. For 2009, Nicklaus Design had 12 courses in &quot;Golf Digest&quot;&#x27;s &quot;75 Best Golf Resorts in North America&quot;.

===Writings and media===
Nicklaus has written several golf instructional books, an autobiography (&quot;My Story&quot;), a book on his golf course design methods and philosophy, and has produced several golf videos. The writer Ken Bowden often assisted him with this work. His book &quot;Golf My Way&quot; is one of the all-time classics of golf instruction, and has been reissued several times since the initial printing in 1974. Nicklaus has also written golf instructional columns for &quot;Golf Magazine&quot; and for &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine, with which he is currently associated. He also appeared as a television analyst and commentator with ABC Sports on golf broadcasts. Several of the books have been reissued, sometimes under different titles, and &quot;My Story&quot; as a special high-quality limited edition for the 2000 Memorial Tournament.

===Golf computer games===

Between 1988 and 1998, Nicklaus also gave his name to promote the successful &quot;Jack Nicklaus&quot; computer game series published by Accolade. Several of the golf courses he designed were incorporated into the series&#x27; various incarnations. In addition, &quot;Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge&quot; by Activision was published in 1999.

===Other interests===
Nicklaus continues to manage the Memorial Tournament, which he founded in his home state of Ohio. The event is played at Muirfield Village, a course that he co-designed with Desmond Muirhead and opened in 1974. The course was officially dedicated on Memorial Day, May 27, 1974, with an exhibition match between Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf. Nicklaus scored a six-under-par 66, which stood as the course record until 1979. The forerunner to this tournament, the Columbus Pro-Am was held on the course where he first learned to play the game of golf, Scioto Country Club, from 1966 through 1975, then the inaugural Memorial Tournament was held at Muirfield Village in 1976. The tournament has become one of the more prestigious events on the PGA Tour.

Each year, the tournament selects one or more individuals as honorees who have made a significant impact on the game. The inaugural tournament in 1976 paid tribute to the late Bobby Jones, while the 25th edition in 2000 honored Nicklaus. The honoree is selected by the Captain&#x27;s Club, a group that acts independently of the tournament organization but also advises on player invitations and the general conduct of the event. Members of the Captain&#x27;s Club have included Peter Alliss, Peggy Kirk Bell, Sean Connery, Arnold Palmer, and Gary Player among others.

The Memorial Tournament continues the PGA Tour&#x27;s philanthropic focus through its relationships with Central Ohio charities. The most significant of which is its relationship with Nationwide Children&#x27;s Hospital since 1976. The Memorial Tournament has raised more than $5.7 million to support the programs and services at Nationwide Children&#x27;s Hospital in those 30-plus years. In 2005 the Memorial made a pledge that will elevate its level of giving to more than $11 million in the coming years.

Nicklaus and his wife Barbara serve as honorary chairman and active chairwoman of the Nicklaus Children&#x27;s Health Care Foundation in North Palm Beach, Florida. The foundation provides valuable programs and services free of charge to more than 4,000 hospitalized children and their families through Child Life programs, the Pediatric Oncology Support Team, and the Safe Kids program. The Nicklauses established &quot;The Jake&quot;, a pro-am golf tournament played annually at The Bear&#x27;s Club in Jupiter, Florida in honor of their 17-month-old grandson who drowned in a hot tub in 2005. It has become the foundation&#x27;s chief fundraiser. Players such as Robert Allenby, Raymond Floyd, Tom Watson, Ian Baker-Finch, Ernie Els, Jay Haas, Johnny Miller and Gary Player have participated.

Nicklaus and retired General John Shalikashvili, who served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1993 to 1997, are serving as honorary chairs for the American Lake Veterans Golf Course capital campaign in Tacoma, Washington. The $4.5 million campaign in 2009 was established to complete the nation&#x27;s only golf course designed for the rehabilitation of wounded and disabled veterans. The existing nine-hole course is operated, maintained, and managed by 160 volunteers. Funds are needed to add nine new holes and other improvements. A two-day event was held at Bighorn Golf Club at Palm Desert, California featuring Nicklaus, who is donating his design services for the &quot;Nicklaus Nine&quot;. In announcing his donation of services, Nicklaus said, &quot;I was moved to see the amazing efforts at American Lake Veterans Golf Course where our wounded warriors learn to play golf with the help of an incredible army of volunteers.&quot; Monies raised during the campaign will be used to construct the new holes, complete the construction of the Rehabilitation and Learning Center, make improvements to the original holes to enhance accessibility, upgrade the maintenance facilities and restrooms, and help underwrite operational costs.

Nicklaus owns Nicklaus Golf Equipment, which he founded in 1992. Nicklaus Golf Equipment manufactures equipment in three brands: Golden Bear, Jack Nicklaus Signature, and Nicklaus Premium. These brands are designed to target golfers at different stages of golfing ability.

He is known for giving advice to younger golfers. One notable example came in 1984, when a teenage Canadian golfer who had previously met Nicklaus at an exhibition wrote him for career advice. The young golfer was right-handed but played left-handed; although he was showing considerable promise as a left-hander, he had been told that he might be an even better player if he switched to right-handed play. He wrote to Nicklaus asking for advice; Nicklaus replied advising him not to change if he was comfortable playing left-handed. The young Canadian, Mike Weir, decided to stay with left-handed play, and eventually became a Masters champion. He still keeps Nicklaus&#x27;s letter framed in his home.

Nicklaus lends his name and likeness to a line of flavored lemonades from Arizona Beverage Company, the same company that sells the Arnold Palmer line of lemonade/iced tea blends.

In 2010, Nicklaus partnered with Terlato Wines to produce a collection of three Napa Valley wines: Jack Nicklaus Private Reserve (a red blend), Cabernet Sauvignon and Private Reserve White (a white blend). In 2012, Golden Bear Reserve, a Bordeaux-style red blend, was released to mark the 50th anniversary of Jack Nicklaus&#x27;s first major championship victory, the 1962 U.S. Open.

==Playing style==
During his prime, Nicklaus was consistently among the longest and straightest hitters on the PGA Tour. In 1963, he won the long-drive contest at the PGA Championship with a belt of 341 yards, 17 inches (312 meters), a record that lasted more than 20 years. He preferred the fade (left-to-right shape) for his ball flight, since this allowed the ball to stop quickly on hard and fast greens. His fades could reach long par fours and par fives in two shots. Nicklaus considers his longest drive in competition to be during the final round of the 1964 Masters on the 15th hole, where he had less than 160 yards left to the 500-yard par five. He hit an eight-iron slightly over the green for his second shot.

Nicklaus debuted as a young pro who hit the ball very high. Later, he could also hit lower-trajectory shots as needed. He also developed a right-to-left controlled draw.

In 1968, IBM kept PGA Tour statistics. Nicklaus led two categories for the season: he had an average driving distance of 275 yards, and hit 75 percent of greens in regulation; both marks were significantly ahead of his rivals.

Even though official PGA Tour statistics were not kept until 1980, Nicklaus was consistently the leader in greens hit in regulation through that year, displaying great command of the long and middle irons. Indeed, Nicklaus remained in the top six of this category through 1985 – far past his best playing years. Nicklaus also finished 10th in driving distance and 13th in driving accuracy in 1980 at age 40, which equated to a &quot;Total Driving&quot; composite of 23 – a statistical level not attained since, by a comfortable margin. Nicklaus led this category through 1982. One key to Nicklaus&#x27;s ball-striking ability and overall power was his exceptional swing tempo. Of this Tom Watson referred to it as Nicklaus&#x27;s greatest strength in its ability to remain smooth. This proved an asset, especially under pressure, which allowed him to obtain great distance control with his irons.

Nicklaus was also known for his course management skills. He would plan to hit each full shot to the optimal position, to best set up his next shot, usually aiming for level lies and clear approach lines, while favoring his preferred shot shapes. He would often hold back on power to achieve this, but had a power advantage over most rivals through the set, so that he could hit a 3-wood or 1-iron from the tee with increased accuracy to avoid trouble, with sufficient length to keep up with the drivers hit by most rivals. An exceptional example of this came in the final round of the 1966 Open Championship at Muirfield, on the 17th hole, a 530-yard par 5 hole. Nicklaus needed a birdie, but the hole was framed by tall fescue rough, and was playing downwind with very firm turf conditions. He used a 3-iron from the tee and hit the shot 290 yards, then hit a 5-iron 240 yards onto the green, two-putted for birdie, and parred the final hole to win the title.

Nicklaus was the first player to chart and document yardages on the course on a consistent, planned basis. For most of his career, he was not known for his skill on touch shots with the wedges, so he would often play to avoid wedge shots that needed less-than-full swings. Gary Player stated that Nicklaus had &quot;the greatest mind the game has ever known&quot;.

Nicklaus was not known for being an outstanding putter, but he was often able to make the important putts when they were needed. Nicklaus&#x27;s putting was highly regarded by his rivals. He was also known as a conservative player at times; he went for broke only when it was necessary. This was especially apparent on the greens, where he would often choose to be less aggressive and make sure of an easy two-putt. Nicklaus spoke about this in his autobiography. &quot;I was a fine two-putter, but sometimes too defensive—too concerned about three-putting—to go for putts that I probably should have gone for.&quot;

==Awards and recognition==

After Nicklaus&#x27;s first year on the PGA Tour in 1962, he received the PGA Tour Rookie of the Year award. As well as receiving the PGA Tour Player of the Year five times and topping the PGA Tour money list eight times, he has also attained the Bob Jones Award and the Payne Stewart Award, among others.

Nicklaus was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 1974 and the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame in 1995. His likeness was featured on a special commemorative issue five-pound note issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland, making him the first living person outside the Royal Family to appear on a British banknote. In 1999 he was on the six man short list for the BBC&#x27;s Sports Personality of the Century.

In 2001, Nicklaus was honored with the &quot;Lombardi Award of Excellence&quot; from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor Coach Lombardi&#x27;s legacy, and is awarded annually to an individual who exemplifies the spirit of the Coach.

There is a Jack Nicklaus Museum on the campus of The Ohio State University in his home town of Columbus. The museum was opened in 2002 and is a state-of-the-art, facility offering a comprehensive view of Nicklaus&#x27;s life and career in and out of golf as well as exhibits celebrating the history and legends of the game.

Nicklaus had the rare privilege of &quot;dotting the &#x27;i&#x27;&quot; of &quot;Script Ohio&quot;, the signature formation of the Ohio State University Marching Band, at the Ohio State homecoming game on October 28, 2006, when the Buckeyes played Minnesota; this is considered the greatest honor that can be bestowed on a non-band member. Nicklaus was the fifth non-band member to receive this award. Other recipients include Bob Hope and Woody Hayes. While at Ohio State University, Nicklaus became a member of the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta.

Along with Annika Sörenstam, Nicklaus was named a Global Ambassador for the International Golf Federation in 2008 and was instrumental in bringing golf to the Olympics for the 2016 and 2020 Games. Golf was last an Olympic sport at the 1904 Games in St. Louis, Missouri when the United States and Canada were the only two competing countries. The International Olympic Committee approved the inclusion by a vote of 63–27, with two abstentions.

Nicklaus joined Arnold Palmer as an honorary starter for the 2010 Masters. Nicklaus became the eighth honorary starter since the tradition began in 1963 when Nicklaus won his first green jacket. The Big Three were once again reunited in Augusta for the 2012 Masters Tournament as Gary Player joined Palmer and Nicklaus to kick off the 76th renewal of the major tournament.

Nicklaus, through his global reach in design and development, as well as the worldwide marketing and licensing of his golf and lifestyle brand, is atop &quot;Golf Inc.&quot; magazine&#x27;s coveted list of the &quot;Most Powerful People in Golf&quot; for a record-extending sixth consecutive year. He is the only golf industry figure who has ever been named to the No. 1 spot for more than three years. Nicklaus topped the 2009 worldwide list of 35 individuals who were selected by a panel of editors for their ability to influence and impact the business of golf, be it the development of courses and communities, the operation of courses, the equipment used by golfers, or the rules and regulations of the game. &quot;Golf Inc.&quot; wrote that while the Golden Bear&#x27;s reign at No. 1 is unprecedented, &quot;the fact is that he keeps adding to his legend, at the design table and in the business world. Despite a worldwide course development slowdown, Nicklaus&#x27;s design firm has over 40 courses in development around the globe ... And he remains perhaps golf&#x27;s most respected spokesperson on a wide range of issues.&quot;

On May 19, 2014, the United States House of Representatives voted to pass , a bill that would award Nicklaus the Congressional Gold Medal &quot;in recognition of his service to the nation in promoting excellence and good sportsmanship&quot;. The bill says that Nicklaus&#x27;s &quot;magnetic personality and unfailing sense of kindness and thoughtfulness have endeared him to millions throughout the world&quot;. Congressman Thomas Massie objected to a voice vote, and demanded a roll call vote. He then tried to rally opposition to the measure, but the vote passed easily over Massie&#x27;s objection: 371–10.

He was awarded the Freedom of the Royal Burgh of St Andrews on 11 July 2022.

==Career achievements==

Nicklaus holds the record for PGA major championships with a total 18; Tiger Woods is in second place with 15. Nicklaus has the third most PGA Tour victories with 73, behind Sam Snead (82) and Woods (82). Nicklaus also holds the record for the most wins at the Masters with six, and The Players Championship with three. He played on six Ryder Cup teams, captained the team twice and the Presidents Cup team four times, and topped the PGA Tour money list and scoring average eight times each. For 24 straight seasons, from 1960 to 1983 inclusive, he made at least one top ten finish in a major championship, and this is a record.

<doc id="242912" wikidata="Q1065129" url="?curid=242912" title="Swedish nobility">
<text>The Swedish nobility (, or , ) has historically been a legally or socially privileged class in Sweden, and part of the so-called &quot;frälse&quot; (a derivation from Old Swedish meaning &quot;free neck&quot;). The archaic term for nobility, &quot;frälse&quot;, also included the clergy, a classification defined by tax exemptions and representation in the diet (the Riksdag). Today the nobility does not maintain its former legal privileges although family names, titles and coats of arms are still protected. The Swedish nobility consists of both &quot;introduced&quot; and &quot;unintroduced&quot; nobility, where the latter has not been formally &quot;introduced&quot; at the House of Nobility (&quot;Riddarhuset&quot;). The House of Nobility still maintains a fee for male members over the age of 18 for upkeep on pertinent buildings in Stockholm.

Belonging to the nobility in present-day Sweden may still carry some informal social privileges, and be of certain social and historical significance particularly among some groups. Sweden has, however, long been a modern democratic society and meritocratic practices are supposed to govern all appointments to state offices by law. No special privileges, in taxation or otherwise, are therefore given to any Swedish citizen based on family origins, the exceptions being the monarch and other members of the royal family.

In 1902, Sven Hedin became the last person, other than members of the royal family, to be ennobled in Sweden. Since 1974, the monarch is only permitted to confer titles of nobility on members of the royal family. As of 2004 there were about 619 existing noble families in Sweden, with about 28,000 members. They are classified as counts (46 families), barons (124 families) and untitled nobility (449 families).

Until 2003 the nobility was regulated by a government statute, but in that year the statute was lifted so that governmental sanction and legal regulation of the nobility was discontinued. The House of Nobility is now a private institution, run as any private corporation under civil commercial law, and is owned by its members. Today, the only privilege of the nobility is the right to use a helm with an open visor in their coats of arms, this according to a 1762 royal act; commoners using open visors or &quot;noblemen&#x27;s shield&quot; (Adelig Sköld) are subjected to a fine. When an association called &quot;Ofrälse och löske mäns samfund för bruk af öppne hjälmar&quot; (Commoners&#x27; and vagabonds&#x27; society for the use of open visors) petitioned the Swedish government for amnesty (Swedish: abolition) in regards to violations of the 1762 act, the petition was not tried nor granted. The Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden ruled, in 2013, that, since no one has the right to amnesty, the government&#x27;s decision did not concern anyone&#x27;s civil rights according to the European Convention on Human Rights, and could thus not be examined by the court.

==Organization==
Swedish nobility is organized into three classes according to a scheme introduced in &quot;riddarhusordningen&quot; (Standing orders of the House of Knights) 1626
* the &quot;Class of Lords&quot; (), comprising counts (&quot;greve&quot;) and barons (&quot;friherre&quot;, &quot;baron&quot;), two titles introduced in 1561 by Erik XIV;
* the &quot;Class of Knights&quot; (), untitled descendants of Swedish Privy Councillors and since 1778 the 300 oldest families in the Class of Esquire as well as the &quot;commander families&quot;, who are of the descendants of commanders of Swedish royal orders;
* the &quot;Class of Esquires&quot; (), other untitled nobles.
The two last classes contains the so-called &quot;untitled nobility&quot; (). The division into classes has roots in the Middle Ages when the nobility &quot;frälse&quot; was divided into lords in the Privy Council, knights and esquires.
Until 1719 the three classes voted separately, but in the Age of Liberty all classes were voting together with one vote for each family head (). This made the vast majority of the untitled nobility in power, for example officers and civil servants were represented.

In 1778 Gustav III restored the classes and class voting and at the same time he reformed the Class of Knights. Originally this class only contained family descendants of Privy Councillors and was the smallest class of the three classes. But Gustav III also introduced in this class the 300 oldest families in the Class of Esquire and also the &quot;commander families&quot;, who are of the descendants of commanders of the Order of the North Star and the Order of the Sword. No more commander families were introduced in the House of Knights after 1809, and thereafter also the class voting was abolished and the nobility was then voting as during the Age of Liberty.

A Swedish duke &quot;(hertig)&quot; has almost always been of royal status and counted as such. The exception in medieval times was Bengt Algotsson. Two men were also created princes (furstar) in the 18th century: Fredrik Vilhelm von Hessenstein and Wilhelm Malte zu Putbus but neither were introduced.

Following the elevation of a commoner into nobility by the Swedish monarch, the new nobleman had to seek &quot;introduction&quot; in order to be a fully recognised member of the House of Nobility &quot;(Riddarhuset),&quot; a term that also refers to its function as a chamber in the Riksdag of the Estates, the Swedish Parliament. In 1866 the Nobility was formally separated from government and incorporated as a separate institution, governed by statutes handed down by the monarch (from 1975: the government). This last link to the government and state was abolished in 2003. The Palace of the Nobility served as official representation for the nobility and was regulated by the Swedish government, but this regulation ceased completely in 2003, as have the privileges. The membership roster is published every three years.

== Medieval nobility: Frälse ==

The institution of Swedish (and Finnish) nobility dates back to 1280, when it was stated by King Magnus III in the Decree of Alsnö that magnates who could afford to contribute a mounted soldier to the cavalry were to be exempted from tax - at least from ordinary taxes - just as the clergy already had been. The archaic Swedish term for nobility, &quot;frälse,&quot; also included the clergy with respect to their exemption from tax. Generally, the nobility grew from wealthier or more powerful members of the peasantry, those who were capable of assigning work or wealth to provide the requisite cavalrymen. These became knights, councilors and castle commanders.

The background for this was that the old system of a &quot;leiðangr&quot; fleet and a king constantly on travel through the realm (between the estates of Uppsala öd) had by this time become outmoded. The crown&#x27;s court and castles were now to be financed through taxes on land.

Soon it was agreed that the king should govern the realm in cooperation with a Privy Council (or Royal Council), in which the bishops and the most distinguished magnates (i.e. the most prominent contributors to the army) participated. When critical decisions were necessary, the whole &quot;frälse&quot; was summoned to the diets.

Swedish nobility had no hereditary fiefs. In the case where a noble was granted a castle belonging to the crown, his heirs couldn&#x27;t later claim their ancestors&#x27; civil or military rights. The lands of the magnates who constituted the medieval nobility were their own and not &quot;on lease&quot; from a feudal king. If they by their own means or exploitation of peasants built a castle and financed troops, then the castle was theirs, but the troops were expected to serve as a part of the army of the realm. In Sweden, there never existed serfdom. Hence, nobility was basically a class of well-off citizens, not owners of other human beings. In the Middle Ages and much of the modern age, nobles and other wealthy men were landowners, as well as lords of peasants and servants. Members of the nobility utilized their economic power and sometimes also other powers to have small-farm owners sell their lands to manor lords, so landowning centralized gradually more in the hands of the noble class.

For extended periods, the commander of Viborg at the Novgorod/Russian front did, in practice, function as a margrave, keeping all the crown&#x27;s income from the fief to use for the defense of the realm&#x27;s eastern border. But despite heavy German influence during the medieval period, the elaborate German system with titles such as Lantgraf, Reichsgraf, Burggraf and Pfalzgraf was never applied in Sweden.

== Ancient nobility ==
Swedish ancient nobility () is the term used for families whose &quot;de facto&quot; status as nobility was formalised by the Ordinance of Alsnö in 1280.

These noble families have no original patents of nobility, the first known being from 1360. The somewhat loose cut-off date or rather rule of thumb for what constitutes &quot;ancient&quot; Swedish nobility is therefore set to during mid 14th century but no later than 1400.

Some Swedish ancient families are still extant at the Swedish House of Nobility or the Finnish House of Nobility; some have been further elevated from Class of Esquires to Class of Knights or to titled nobility (count or baron). In 1778 all ancient noble families in the Class of Esquires were elevated to the Class of Knights.

Some ancient noble families:

* Aspenäs
* Banér
* Bese
*Bielke (extant, Sweden&#x27;s second oldest noble family)
*Björn

== Nobility after 1561 ==
At the coronation of Eric XIV in 1561, Swedish nobility became formally hereditary for the first time upon the creation of the higher titles of Count &quot;(greve)&quot; and Baron &quot;(friherre)&quot;. The House of Knights was organized in 1626. The grounds for introduction into this chamber became either birth into an &quot;ancient&quot; noble family or ennoblement by the sovereign. Consequently, genealogy flourished.

The Lord High Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, was the architect of the Instrument of Government of 1634, which laid the foundation of modern Sweden. It guaranteed that all government appointments were to be filled by candidates from the nobility, a move which helped mobilize support for, rather than opposition to, a centralized national government.

Due to the many wars fought by Sweden, the crown needed some means of rewarding its officers, and since the royal coffers were not without end, ennoblement and grants of land were useful substitutes for cash payments. During the 17th century, the number of noble families grew by a factor of five. In less than a century, the nobility&#x27;s share of Swedish land ownership rose from 16% to over 60%, which led to considerably lower tax revenue for the crown. The &quot;Reduction&quot; of 1655 and 1680, however, brought land back into the crown&#x27;s possession.

Historically all members of a noble family were generally titled. If the family was of the rank of a Count or a Baron, all members received that title as well. However, following the new Instrument of Government from 1809, a change was made more in line with the British system so that, for later nobility, only the head of the family would hold the title (if there is one). There are a few families where these systems overlap such that the vast majority are nobles pre-1809 without title, while the heads of the families have been elevated to count or baron after 1809. The vast majority of noble families are still of the old kind where all members are regarded as nobles.

No hereditary title of nobility has been granted since 1902, when explorer Sven Hedin was ennobled by the King (that honor was hereditary, but he left no heirs). Since 1975 the Swedish monarch and government no longer have the right to ennoble or to confer knighthoods and orders on Swedes. Titles are still given to members of the Swedish royal house where princes and princesses are made non-hereditary dukes or duchesses of selected provinces, but these are honorary titles within that house, not titles of nobility.

==Unintroduced nobility==

Unintroduced families could use their titles, if they had any, and noble elements and styles in their coats of arms. There has never been legislation in Sweden preventing anyone from purporting to belong to nobility. The recognition of such noble status in society was of a social, not a legal, nature, as has all Swedish nobility become since it was separated from the government more recently.

Sweden has had a significant number of unintroduced noble families (as of 2010 comprising 99 living families and around 450 individuals), several of which have been historically prominent. The families fall into four groups:
#Foreign nobility, being families of foreign origin (most commonly Baltic German) which had noble status in a different country than Sweden, and which partially or wholly live in Sweden. This group is the largest.
#Families of Swedish origin which were granted noble status and/or titles by a foreign country (for example, members of the royal House of Bernadotte have been granted Belgian and Luxembourgish princely and comital titles).
#Families which have been ennobled by the Swedish monarch, but which have not been introduced at the House of Nobility. This group is small.
#Armigerous families of foreign origin which have traditionally been included in the various directories of unintroduced nobility, but whose original noble status has not been proven. They are included in Swedish unintroduced nobility for traditional reasons, such as having been considered noble in Sweden for an extended period of time. This group is also small.

Three successive almanach series of unintroduced nobility have been published; the first in 1886, the second in 1912, and the third in 1935; it came out most recently in 2010. An association of unintroduced nobility, Sveriges Ointroducerade Adels Förening, private club with no official standing, was founded in 1911. Several branches of the House of Bernadotte have chosen to become members of this association, as a result of members of the royal family being denied the use of Swedish titles upon marrying non-royals, but being granted foreign (Luxembourgish or Belgian) titles. Carl Johan Bernadotte was chairman of the association for many years.

==Surnames==
Surnames in Sweden can be traced to the 15th century, when they were first used by the Gentry (&quot;Frälse&quot;), i.e., priests and nobles. The names of these were usually in Swedish, Latin, German or Greek. The adoption of Latin names was first used by the Catholic clergy in the 15th century. The given name was preceded by &quot;Herr&quot; (Sir), followed by a Latinized form of patronymic names.

Starting from the time of the Reformation, a common naming practice among the clergy was to use the Latinized form of their birthplace (e.g. Laurentius Petri Gothus, from Östergötland). Later merchants and other social groups discarded the formerly used family names (such as patronymic surnames). Instead they adopted high-sounding Latin surnames. Another subsequent practice was the use of the Greek language, with the ending of -&quot;ander&quot; (the Greek word for &quot;man&quot;). The use of surnames was still quite uncommon in the 17th century among the nobility and the educated class. Furthermore, the concept of hereditary surnames was also limited to a few families.

When a family was ennobled, it was usually given a name—just as with lordships of England and other Western European countries. This was a period which produced a myriad of two-word Swedish-language family names for the nobility (very favored prefixes were &quot;Adler&quot;-, &quot;eagle&quot;; &quot;Ehren&quot;-, &quot;honor&quot;; &quot;Silfver&quot;-, &quot;silver&quot;; and &quot;Gyllen&quot;-, &quot;golden&quot;). The regular difference with Britain was that it became the new surname of the whole house, and the old surname was dropped altogether.

== Privileges ==
The noble estates are not abolished in Sweden, but their privileged position has been weakened step by step since 1680. The nobility&#x27;s political privileges were practically abolished by the reformation of the Riksdag of the Estates in 1866, and the last rights of precedence to certain governmental offices were removed in the 1920s. By then the last tax exemption privileges had also been abolished. However, some minor privileges remained until 2003, including the right to be beheaded by sword, when the law granting these noble privileges was completely abolished and the government no longer has the right to call the heads of families to be assembled in session.

The prerogatives of nobility today are limited to protection of noble titles and certain elements and styles used in their coats of arms (this according to a 1762 act): a helm with an open visor, a coronet showing rank, a medallion and the use of supporters. Modern Swedish law makes no distinctions on the basis of nobility.

=== Crowns and coronets of rank ===
==Exceptional cases==
Outside Sweden, Saint Bridget (1303–1373) became known as the &quot;Princess of Nericia&quot;, which appears to have been a noble, rather than a royal title, since she was not the daughter of a king.

<text>Alinghi, or Alinghi Red Bull Racing because of the sports marketing branding by Red Bull, is the syndicate set up by Ernesto Bertarelli, racing under the colors of the Société Nautique de Genève, to challenge for the America&#x27;s Cup, as well as other competitions. Bertarelli had raced several smaller yachts named &quot;Alinghi&quot; previously, but 2003 was his first attempt at the America&#x27;s Cup. Alinghi challenged for and won the 2003 America&#x27;s Cup in Auckland New Zealand and successfully defended it at the 2007 America&#x27;s Cup in Valencia, Spain. Alinghi lost the America&#x27;s Cup to the Golden Gate Yacht Club and their team BMW Oracle Racing in a Deed of Gift match in Valencia, Spain in February 2010.

For the 2003 event, Team New Zealand as the holder of the America&#x27;s Cup, in consultation with Prada, the Challenger of Record, removed the nationality rule that stipulated that all of the crew members must be nationals of the challenging syndicate.

Alinghi took full advantage of this rule change and hired many of the world&#x27;s top America&#x27;s Cup sailors particularly from New Zealand. New Zealanders saw the defection of key members of Team New Zealand to Alinghi as an act of disloyalty to their home countryunderstandable against a background of strong nationwide public support for Team New Zealand that they saw as representing their country rather than just representing the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron.

After a series of discussions with Team New Zealand it was announced that they would compete in the Louis Vuitton Pacific Series in 2009.

In July 2010, it appeared that the team was being disbanded and would not compete in future America&#x27;s Cups. On 26 November 2010, Alinghi formally confirmed that it would not participate in the 2013 America&#x27;s Cup.

In December 2021 Ernesto Bertarelli announced the launch of the new Alinghi Red Bull Racing to compete in the 37th America&#x27;s Cup. Arnaud Psarofaghis will serve as Skipper.

==America&#x27;s Cup==

=== 2003 challenge ===
Coinciding with the change in the nationality rules concerning the crew and in order to maximize the chances of success, Alinghi hired Russell Coutts, the successful skipper and helmsman of Team New Zealand. Coutts had already won the America&#x27;s Cup for New Zealand in 1995 and successfully defended for New Zealand in 2000. Along with Coutts came several other important Kiwi sailors, including Team New Zealand tactician Brad Butterworth. Grant Simmer, another America&#x27;s Cup veteran, joined as managing director and head of design. Bertarelli, the syndicate&#x27;s president, served as navigator during the racing.

Apart from New Zealand, the Alinghi team consisted of members from Germany, the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Spain, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Portugal, Turkey, Ireland, the UK (from Scotland and Wales), Belgium, South Africa, Australia, Uruguay, Argentina, Denmark, Ecuador, and Switzerland.

The Alinghi boats for the 2003 challenge, &quot;SUI-64&quot; (the race boat) and the &quot;SUI-75&quot;, were developed specifically for the race by the Alinghi team in close collaboration with the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. Alinghi also had a test yacht from the 2000 America&#x27;s cup, &quot;SUI-59&quot; (formerly called &quot;Fast 2000&quot;).

Alinghi raced to a 5–0 victory against Team New Zealand on 2 March 2003, winning the America&#x27;s Cup.

They guaranteed themselves a further stake in the history books by becoming the first team since the inaugural race in 1851 to return the Auld Mug to Europe and for being the first team to win the Cup on its first attempt.

Alinghi&#x27;s stated vision was &quot;to win the America&#x27;s Cup, while earning respect and recognition as a world class sports team as well as sharing our passion&quot;.

Due to this victory, Team Alinghi received one of the highest honors in sport, the Olympic Cup in 2004. The &quot;Coupe Olympique&quot; is an award given annually by the International Olympic Committee.

===2007 defense===

Team Alinghi fired its skipper Russell Coutts on 27 April 2004. Immediately beforehand, Alinghi (via &quot;America&#x27;s Cup Management&quot;) changed the America&#x27;s Cup Rules to prevent any team members from moving between teams until the completion of the 2007 America&#x27;s Cup. Alinghi, as the then current holders of the America&#x27;s Cup, were fully entitled to change the rule. Nine months later the conflict was ended with a short statement.

The sailing team was extended again and was led for the 2007 campaign by Brad Butterworth, Alinghi&#x27;s tactician and vice-president. Butterworth was highly experienced in America&#x27;s Cup racing having sailed aboard the winning boat in the three previous competitions. Butterworth&#x27;s team had many world-class sailors including Peter Holmberg, Ed Baird, Juan Vila, Jordi Calafat, Warwick Fleury, Simon Daubney, and Murray Jones. Jochen Schümann, winner of four Olympic medals, was the sports director for the sailing team.

Alinghi participated in all Louis Vuitton Acts, along with the 11 challengers from nine nations, before defending the America&#x27;s Cup during the Match Race in June 2007. UBS, and BT Infonet renewed their commitment to the team as Main Partners for the next four years, along with Audemars Piguet, SGS, Nespresso, MSC Cruises, WISeKey and North Sails as co sponsors. Alinghi&#x27;s first America&#x27;s Cup defeat came on 24 June 2007 when they were defeated by Emirates Team New Zealand in the second race of the 2007 America&#x27;s Cup off Valencia.

After a series of close races between the seemingly closely matched competitors, Alinghi won their final race against Emirates Team New Zealand on 3 July 2007, defending the America&#x27;s Cup with five wins to Team New Zealand&#x27;s two.

=== 2010 defense ===

America&#x27;s Cup Management announced on 5 July 2007 that the protocol for the 2010 America&#x27;s Cup had been agreed between the defending yacht club, Société Nautique de Genève of Switzerland, and the Challenger of Record, the Club Náutico Español de Vela of Spain. However this arrangement did not survive a legal challenge from BMW Oracle Racing, who successfully argued that Club Náutico Español de Vela was not a valid Challenger of Record due to non-compliance with the terms of the America&#x27;s Cup Deed of Gift. Swiss based companies WISeKey and Hublot were the two primary sponsors of Alinghi&#x27;s 2010 defense.

After extensive court action, Golden Gate Yacht Club (whose team is BMW Oracle Racing) was declared Challenger of Record and sailed against Alinghi in a Deed of Gift match in February 2010 at Valencia, Spain. The competing boats, &quot;Alinghi 5&quot; and &quot;USA 17&quot;, were both 90-foot multihulls. &quot;USA 17&quot;″s rigid wing sail provided a decisive advantage and Golden Gate Yacht Club won the 2010 America&#x27;s Cup two races to none.

===2023 challenge===
On 14 December 2021 Alinghi announced a joint-venture with Red Bull. Alinghi founder Ernesto Bertarelli and two-time Olympic champion Hans-Peter Steinacher announced the launch of the new Alinghi Red Bull Racing and presented its logo at the Société Nautique de Genève.

Arnaud Psarofaghis will serve as Skipper.

== D35 Trophy, Bol d&#x27;Or, Extreme Sailing Series, GC32 Racing Tour==
===Bol d&#x27;Or===

<text>The George Cross (GC) is the highest award bestowed by the British government for non-operational gallantry or gallantry not in the presence of an enemy. In the British honours system, the George Cross, since its introduction in 1940, has been equal in stature to the Victoria Cross, the highest military award for valour. It is awarded &quot;for acts of the greatest heroism or for most conspicuous courage in circumstance of extreme danger&quot;, not in the presence of the enemy, to members of the British armed forces and to British civilians. Posthumous awards have been allowed since it was instituted. It was previously awarded to residents of Commonwealth countries (and in one case to Malta, a colony that subsequently became a Commonwealth country), most of which have since established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians including police, emergency services and merchant seamen. Many of the awards have been personally presented by the British monarch to recipients or, in the case of posthumous awards, to next of kin. The investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace.

==Creation==
The George Cross was instituted on 24 September 1940 by King George VI. At this time, shortly after the climax of the Battle of Britain and during the third week of the Blitz, there was a strong desire to reward the many acts of civilian courage. The existing awards open to civilians were not judged suitable to meet the new situation, therefore it was decided to institute the George Cross and the George Medal to recognise civilian gallantry in the face of enemy action, and brave deeds more generally.

Announcing the new award, the King said:

The medal was designed by Percy Metcalfe. The Warrant for the GC (along with that of the George Medal), dated 24 September 1940, was published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 31 January 1941.

The King in his speech announcing the new award, stated that it would rank next to the Victoria Cross. This was second on the Order of Wear, much higher than the then existing awards for bravery not in the presence of the enemy, the highest being the two-class Albert Medal (AM); and the lowest being the single class Empire Gallantry Medal (EGM). In a substitution of awards unprecedented in the history of British decorations, holders of the EGM were required to exchange their insignia for the GC, most receiving their replacement GC at a formal investiture. The four honorary EGM awards to foreigners were not exchanged and could therefore continue to be worn. In 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert Medal and the Edward Medal (EM) became George Cross recipients, but unlike the EGM exchange of insignia, they had the option of retaining their original insignia. Of the 69 holders of the Albert Medal and 70 holders of the Edward Medal eligible to exchange, 49 and 59 respectively took up the option.

==Award==
The GC, which may be awarded posthumously, is granted in recognition of:

The award is for civilians but also for military personnel whose actions would not normally be eligible to receive military awards, such as gallantry not in the face of the enemy. The Warrant states:



In June 1941 the specification of the ribbon width was amended to one and a half inches.

Bars can be awarded for further acts of bravery meriting the GC, although none have yet been awarded. In common with the Victoria Cross, in undress uniform or on occasions when the medal ribbon alone is worn, a miniature replica of the cross is affixed to the centre of the ribbon, a distinction peculiar to these two premier awards for bravery. In the event of a second award, a second replica would be worn on the ribbon.

Recipients are entitled to the postnominal letters GC.

All original individual GC awards and the latest collective award to the National Health Service have been published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;.

==George Cross Committee==
The George Cross Committee of the Cabinet Office considers cases of military and civilian gallantry. The committee has no formal terms of reference.

==Recipients==
Since its inception in 1940, the GC has been awarded 416 times: 401 to men, 12 to women, and three times collectively. There have been 165 original awards including the three collective awards, including 106 made before 1947. About 30% of the 162 original awards to individuals have been to civilians. There have been 251 exchange awards, 112 to Empire Gallantry Medal recipients, 69 to Albert Medal recipients and 70 to Edward Medal recipients. Of the 162 individuals who received original awards, 86 have been posthumous. In addition, there were five posthumous recipients of the Empire Gallantry Medal whose awards in four cases were gazetted after the start of the Second World War and whose awards were also exchanged for the GC. All the other exchange recipients were living as of the date of the decisions for the exchanges. Dominic Troulan represented recipients at the 2023 Coronation.

===Collective awards===

The three collective awards have been to the Island of Malta, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the National Health Service of the United Kingdom (NHS).

====Malta====
The GC was awarded to the island of Malta in a letter dated 15 April 1942 from King George VI to the island&#x27;s Governor Lieutenant-General Sir William Dobbie:
The Governor answered:
The cross and the messages are today in the War Museum in Fort Saint Elmo, Valletta. The fortitude of the population under sustained enemy air raids, and a naval blockade which almost saw them starved into submission, won widespread admiration in Britain and other Allied nations. Eric Grove argued on the BBC in 2017 that the George Cross was awarded as a propaganda gesture and consequently &#x27;the island of Malta could not be allowed to fall as Singapore had done. Indeed, the North African campaign was being fought in 1942 as much to sustain Malta as vice versa.&#x27;

The George Cross was incorporated into the Flag of Malta in 1943 and, since independence in 1964, remains on the flag.

====Royal Ulster Constabulary====
The GC was awarded to the RUC in 1999 by Queen Elizabeth II following the advice of the first Blair ministry. The citation published by Buckingham Palace on 23 November 1999 stated:
The Queen presented the George Cross on 12 April 2000 in a ceremony at Hillsborough Castle, County Down, attended by the senior RUC officers; the cross was accepted by Constable Paul Slaine, who had lost both legs in a 1992 IRA attack.

The Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 gave effect to much of the Patten Report, with &quot;the Police Service of Northern Ireland (incorporating the Royal Ulster Constabulary)&quot; established on 4 November 2001. The RUC is often referred to as &quot;RUC GC&quot;; the 2000 act established a registered charity &quot;to be known as &#x27;The Royal Ulster Constabulary GC Foundation&#x27; for the purpose of marking the sacrifices and honouring the achievements of the Royal Ulster Constabulary&quot;; other instances include the names of the RUC GC Widows&#x27; Association, RUC GC Historical Society, and RUCGC–PSNI Benevolent Fund.

====National Health Service====

On 5 July 2021, on the 73rd anniversary of the founding of the NHS of the UK, Queen Elizabeth II announced in a personal handwritten message that the four NHS organisations of the United Kingdom would be awarded the George Cross. It was reported that the award was recommended by the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. The conferral of the award followed an 18-month period in which the health service had been at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus pandemic in the UK.

The message read:

It is with great pleasure, on behalf of a grateful nation, that I award the George Cross to the National Health Services of the United Kingdom. This award recognises all NHS staff, past and present, across all disciplines and all four nations. Over more than seven decades, and especially in recent times, you have supported the people of our country with courage, compassion and dedication, demonstrating the highest standards of public service. You have our enduring thanks and heartfelt appreciation. Elizabeth R.

===Awards to the Commonwealth===
====Canada====
There have been 10 GCs awarded to Canadians including those by substitution for awards superseded by the GC. The recipients comprised nine men and one woman. The GC is no longer awarded to Canadians by the King of Canada, who awards the Canadian Cross of Valour instead.

====Australia====
The George Cross was awarded to 23 Australians, 11 to the Australian forces and 12 to civilians. It is the highest decoration of the Australian honours system after the British Victoria Cross and the Victoria Cross for Australia. Although Australia established the Cross of Valour within the Australian honours system in 1975 &#x27;for acts of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme peril&#x27; it was not until 1992 that Australia officially ceased recommending British honours. During the period 1975 to 1992, the last George Cross to an Australian was awarded in 1978.

Of the 23 awards, 14 were direct awards and nine were Empire Gallantry Medal (two), Albert Medal (six) and Edward Medal (one) exchange awards. Four awards were to officers of the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve who served in the extremely dangerous role of mine disposal during the Second World War. Privates Benjamin Gower Hardy and Ralph Jones were posthumously awarded the George Cross for manning a Vickers machine gun during the Cowra breakout, a mass escape by Japanese prisoners of war in central New South Wales on 5 August 1944. Hardy and Jones disabled the weapon and denied its use to the escaping prisoners before they were overwhelmed and killed by the escapees. Courage of a different sort was displayed by two prisoners of war who endured terrible suffering. Captain Lionel Colin Matthews was eventually executed by his captors for building a resistance network in British North Borneo in the Second World War, while Private Horace William Madden, captured in Korea in 1951, died of privations while assisting fellow prisoners and openly resisting enemy efforts to force him to collaborate. The last Australian to be awarded the GC (in 1978) was Constable Michael Kenneth Pratt of the Victoria Police, Melbourne, for arresting two armed bank robbers in June 1976. For 39 years until the award to Dominic Troulon in 2017, Pratt was the most recent living civilian George Cross recipient. 

A memorial to Australian recipients, George Cross Park, was opened in Canberra, the Australian capital, on 4 April 2001 by the Governor General of Australia, Sir William Deane.

====New Zealand====
In 1999, the New Zealand Cross replaced the role of the George Cross. Up until then, the last George Cross awarded to a New Zealander, was posthumously awarded to Sgt Stewart Guthrie of the New Zealand Police for his actions and bravery during the Aramoana massacre.

==Annuity==
Holders of the Victoria Cross or the George Cross are entitled to an annuity, the amount of which is determined by the awarding government. , the annuity paid by the British government was £10,000. In Canada under the &quot;Gallantry Awards Order&quot;, members of the Canadian Forces, or people who joined the British forces before 31 March 1949 while domiciled in Canada or Newfoundland, receive $3,000 per year. Australia has been responsible for the payment of both the Victoria Cross Allowance and the George Cross annuity since the 1940s. The Victoria Cross Allowance which includes both the Victoria Cross for Australia and the British Victoria Cross is included in s.103 of the &quot;Veterans&#x27; Entitlement Act&quot; and is presently $A4,447 per year. Although there is not a statutory instrument for the payment of the George Cross annuity, both annuities for the Australian Cross of Valour and George Cross match the Victoria Cross Allowance payment.

==Restriction of use==
Since 1943, in accordance with the &quot;George Cross (Restriction of Use) Ordinance&quot;, it is unlawful in Malta to use the George Cross, an imitation of it or the words &quot;George Cross&quot; for the purposes of trade or business without the Prime Minister&#x27;s authorisation.

<doc id="242920" wikidata="Q3710513" url="?curid=242920" title="Music of Haiti">
<text>The music of Haiti combines a wide range of influences drawn from the diverse population that has settled on this Caribbean island. It often has hints of French, African rhythms, Spanish elements and others who have inhabited the island of Hispaniola and minor native Taino influences. Styles of music unique to the nation of Haiti include music derived from rara parading music, twoubadou &quot;ballads&quot;, mini-jazz &quot;rock bands&quot;, rasin movement, hip hop Creòle, the wildly popular compas, and méringue as its basic rhythm. Haitian music is influenced mostly by European colonial ties and African migration (through slavery). In the case of European colonization, musical influence has derived primarily from the French.

One of Haiti&#x27;s musical traditions is known to outsiders simply as compas. But in the former non-standardized Haitian Creole, Haitians identify it variously as &quot;compa, conpa, and konpa-dirék&quot;. Regardless of its various spellings, compas refers to a complex, ever-changing music genre that fuses African rhythms, European ballroom dancing, and Haitian bourgeois aesthetics. The word may have derived from the Spanish compás, which relates to the musical rhythm of the &quot;beat&quot; or &quot;pulse.&quot; One of the most distinctive features of Haitian compas music is its steady, pulsing drumbeat, which makes it easy to dance to.

Haïti Chérie is a traditional patriotic and most recognizable song of Haiti that was written and composed by Dr. Othello Bayard de Cayes and was initially called &quot;Souvenir d&#x27;Haïti&quot;. It represents the pride Haitian people feel for their country and culture. Within the Haitian community, at home and abroad, it is widely considered as a second national anthem to La Dessalinienne and the song has recorded several different versions.

Haiti did not have recorded music until 1937 when Jazz Guignard was recorded non-commercially. One of the most current popular Haitian artists is Wyclef Jean. His music is somewhat hip hop mixed with worldbeat.

==Folk music==

===Kontradans===
===Karabiyen===
Karabiyen or Carabineer is a Haitian traditional dance style that is said to be created by Euphémie Daguilh, one of Dessalines&#x27; friend. The dance is said to be created for the Haitian soldiers during the Haitian Revolution, and meant to be danced with their carabine strap to their back, hence the name. Dessalines himself was an excellent karabiyen dancer according to oral and written tradition.

===Méringue===

Méringue is a guitar-based style historically connected to merengue but without the use of the accordion. The blend of African and European cultures has created popular dance music, music played on simple acoustic instruments. Méringue has lost popularity to kompa.

===Rara===
Rara music is a Lenten processional music with strong ties to the Vodou religious tradition. It has often been confused with Haitian Carnival, since both celebrations involve large groups of dancing revelers in the streets. Rara is performed between Ash Wednesday (the day after Carnival ends) until Easter Sunday (or Easter Monday in some parts of Haiti.) Rara bands roam the streets performing religious ceremonies as part of their ritual obligations to the lwa. Gede, a spirit associated with death and sexuality, is an important spiritual presence in Rara celebrations and often possesses a houngan (male Vodou priest) or mambo (female Vodou priest) before the band begins its procession, blessing the participants and wishing them safe travels for their nightly sojourns.

===Twoubadou===
Twoubadou is a form of music played by peripatetic troubadours playing some combination of acoustic, guitar, beat box and accordion instruments singing ballads of Haitian, French or Caribbean origin. It is in some ways similar to Son Cubano from Cuba as a result of Haitian migrant laborers who went to work on Cuban sugar plantations at the turn of the 20th century. Musicians perform at the Port-au-Prince International Airport and also at bars and restaurants in Pétion-Ville.

==Popular music==

===Compas / &quot;Konpa&quot;===

Compas, short for &quot;compas direct&quot;, is the modern méringue (&quot;mereng&quot; in creole) that was popularized in the mid-1950s by the sax and guitar player Nemours Jean-Baptiste. His méringue soon became popular throughout the Antilles, especially in Martinique and Guadeloupe. Webert Sicot and Nemours Jean-Baptiste became the two leaders in the group. Sicot then left and formed a new group and an intense rivalry developed, though they remained good friends. To differentiate himself from Nemours, Sicot called his modern méringue, cadence rampa.

In Creole, it is spelled as &quot;konpa dirèk&quot; or simply &quot;konpa&quot;. It is commonly spelled as it is pronounced as &quot;kompa&quot;.

===Mini-jazz===
Mini-jazz was formed in the mid-&#x27;60s characterized by the rock bands formula of two guitars, one bass, drum-conga-cowbell, some use an alto sax or a full horn section, others use a keyboard, accordion or lead guitar. However, all these small jazz or bands had their guitars with sophisticated styles. The 1970s were dominated by mini-jazz, which still used a variant of the méringue style. One of the mini-jazz groups, Tabou Combo, became the most popular ensemble of Haiti. From Haiti the mini-jazz formula replicated in the French Antilles in the 1970s.

===Haitian rock (rock kreyòl)===
Haitian rock originated as rock n roll in Haiti in the early 1960s, performed by rock bands called &quot;yeye bands&quot;. These were short-lived when they added compas direct to their repertoire and called the result &quot;mini-jazz&quot;. Today, Haitian rock is an alternative rock music with a blend of Caribbean flavor that was first introduced to Haiti by Yohann Doré. Splash were a popular Haitian rock band of the 1990s.

===Mizik rasin===
Starting in the late 1970s (with discontent surrounding the increasing opulence of the Duvalier dictatorship), youth from Port-au-Prince (and to a lesser extent Cap-Haïtien and other urban areas) began experimenting with new types of life. François Duvalier&#x27;s appropriation of Vodou images as a terror technique, the increase in U.S. assembly and large-scale export agriculture, the popularity of disco, and Jean-Claude Duvalier&#x27;s appreciation of kompa and chanson française disillusioned many youth and love.

To question the dictatorship&#x27;s notion of &quot;the Haitian nation&quot; (and thus the dictatorship itself), several men began trying a new way of living, embodied in the Sanba Movement. They drew inspiration from the global movements such as Black power and Hippies, along with a major influence from reggae superstar Bob Marley and extensively from rural life in Haiti. The Sanba dressed in the traditional blue denim (karoko) of peasants, eschewed the commercialized and processed life offered by global capitalism, and celebrated the values of communal living. Later, they adopted matted hair similar to Jamaican dreadlocks, but identified the style as something that existed in Haiti with the term &quot;cheve simbi&quot;, referring to water spirits.

The most well-known of these artists were Sanba Zao (Louis Leslie Marcellin), Ayizan (Harry Sanon), Azouke (Gregory Sanon), Aboudja (Ronald Derencourt), Kebyesou Danle (Jean Raymond) and Chico (Yves Boyer). They formed a band called Sanba yo and later, Gwoup Sa. Later still, other musicians like Lòlò (Theodore Beaubrun), Papa Bonga, and Eddy François joined the trend. This was the modern precursor to what would become mizik rasin. One of these groups recorded a song in the 1980s for a UNICEF campaign for vaccination, which is included on the LP &quot;Konbit!&quot;.

In the 1990s, commercial success came to the musical genre that came to be known as &quot;mizik rasin&quot;, or &quot;roots music&quot;. Musicians like Boukman Eksperyans, and Boukan Ginen, and to a lesser extent RAM, incorporated reggae, rock and funk rhythms into traditional forms and instrumentation, including &quot;rara&quot;, music from &quot;kanaval&quot;, or traditional spiritual music from the rural hamlets called lakous, like Lakou Souvnans, Lakou Badjo, Lakou Soukri, or Lakou Dereyal. Though initially the people involved followed the ways of the Sanba Movement, eventually this began to fade. Increased political and economic pressures saw many of these people emigrate (to the U.S. and Canada, primarily). Both those who stayed and those who traveled between countries began adding more non-Haitian (strictly speaking) elements and implemented a more commercial sound to earn more money and a wider audience.

RAM recorded a traditional Vodou folk song in Haïti called &quot;Fèy&quot;. In Haitian Creole, &quot;fèy&quot; means &quot;leaf&quot;, and the lyrics of the song describe a leaf falling from a tree.

===Zouk or zouk-love===

The Haitian cadence and its compas has been dominating the Antilles music scene since its introduction in the late 1950s. Compas direct is a modern méringue popularized in 1955 by the Nemours Jean-Baptiste, a Haitian saxophone and guitar player, which was appropriated by the Antilleans who labeled their version &quot;cadence-lypso&quot; and later, &quot;zouk&quot; or &quot;zouk-love&quot;.

The original zouk was zouk béton, a fast tempo jump up carnival style of music originating from the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, was popularized by the French Antilles Kassav&#x27; in the 1980s. However it was too fast, and the style lost ground in the 1980s due to the strong presence of kadans or compas, the main music of the French Antilles. The problem is that musicians from Martinique and Guadeloupe have wrongly labeled compas as &quot;zouk&quot; or &quot;zouk love&quot;, creating a sense of confusion in Africa, Cape Verde, Angola, Brazil, Portugal and other places. Haitian musicians taught Antilleans how to play compas, and it is from them that zouk&#x27;s rhythms derive in origin, which some credit is due in its creation. In all account, Haitian musicians describe zouk musicians as first rate, because they are now part of the forefront of the musical scene.

Today, zouk-love (the current &quot;zouk&quot;) is the French Antilles cadence or compas, characterized by a slow, soft and sexual rhythm.

===Haitian hip hop (rap kreyòl)===
The local homegrown Haitian hip hop movement is rising in popularity in Haiti and other Haitian communities. It is becoming more and more popular with Haitian youth, often communicating social and political topics as well as materialism. Kompa as well as other popular local music beats are used frequently with urban sounds. Recent years have seen a rise in popularity for Haitian Hip-Hop artists such as Barikad Crew, Mach-Hommy and Jimmy O. Other Haitian hip hop artists have yet to evolve.

==Spiritual music==

===Haitian gospel music===
===Haitian Vodou drumming===
==Music education and mentoring==
BLUME Haiti (Building Leaders Using Music Education) is an American NGO that trains teachers of classical music in Haiti and partners with other organizations to provide training in instrument repair. It has reached approximately 5,000 students. It partners with Luthiers Sans Frontieres UK among others.

Carrefour Collaborative, an NGO based in Chicago, promotes and produces Underground music and musicians in Haiti by providing high end audio recording equipment, video production help and mentors. The goal is exposure to American audiences. Gaetville, an MC who also does Hip hop and Dance Hall music, was the first musician they produced.

El Sistemia - a Venezuelan method of teaching classical music, started in Haiti in 2012 with the encouragement of former president of Haiti Michel Martelly - a former singer.

==Music institutions and festivals==
The Haitian Carnival is an important part of the Haitian culture. It is also significant for Haitian musicians as an opportunity to showcase their talents and expand their audience by performing for Carnival crowds.

Ten days after the 2010 earthquake, the &quot;Hope for Haiti Now&quot; telethon event was launched in the United States, effectively taking over the mediasphere and reaching hundreds of millions of households and viewers. It focused on appealing to the viewing public&#x27;s empathy for the survivors of the disaster, allowing ordinary citizens to help in a collective relief effort by contributing money donations to NGOs providing Humanitarian aid to earthquake survivors. The telethon attracted support through a variety of celebrity musical performances and staged calls for empathy, using digital social networks to disseminate its appeal to the moral responsibility of the viewer-consumers. It offered the possibility for viewers to text donations on cell phones, and raised a reported $58 million by the day after its launch. The form of this fundraising effort emphasizes and aligns with the power of music and singing in Haitian society. Quake survivors used the embodied technique of singing to orient themselves in the face of sudden and violent rupture.

<text>The Skywalker family is a fictional legendary human family in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. Within the series&#x27; fictional universe, the Skywalkers are presented as a bloodline with strong inherent capabilities related to the Force and sometimes lightsaber skills. Luke Skywalker, his twin sister Princess Leia Organa, and their father Darth Vader are central characters in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film trilogy. Darth Vader, in his previous identity as Anakin Skywalker, is a lead character in the prequel film trilogy and so is his wife and the twins&#x27; mother Padmé Amidala; while his mother Shmi is a minor character in the first and second films respectively. Leia and Han Solo&#x27;s son, Ben Solo, renamed himself Kylo Ren and is the main antagonist in the sequel film trilogy, while they and Luke serve as supporting characters. Shmi, Padmé, and Han are the only members who are not Force-sensitive. The Skywalker bloodline, alongside the Palpatine bloodline, are the two bloodlines that are the strongest with the Force.

==History==
In terms of the series&#x27; internal chronology, the Skywalkers first appeared in the 1999 film &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. In this film, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn discovers Shmi Skywalker and her son Anakin as slaves on the planet Tatooine. Shmi informs Qui-Gon that Anakin has no father, leading Qui-Gon to suggest that Anakin is a product of midi-chlorians (Force-imparting microorganisms). As the film progresses, Anakin leaves Tatooine to begin his Jedi training.

&quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) reveals that, in Anakin&#x27;s absence, Shmi has married Cliegg Lars, becoming the stepmother of Owen. Shmi later dies after being kidnapped and taken away by Tusken Raiders. Owen tells Anakin they are stepbrothers and later marries Beru Whitesun. Anakin secretly marries Naboo Senator Padmé Amidala at the end of the film.

In &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005), Padme dies giving birth to twins, Luke and Leia. Luke is raised by Beru and Owen Lars on Tatooine. Leia is raised by Senator Bail Organa and Queen Breha Organa on Alderaan. Anakin, who has since become the Sith Lord Darth Vader, is unaware of his children&#x27;s birth. The twins soon became part of the Rebel Alliance following the deaths of their adoptive families at the hands of the Empire. Neither of the twins know of their relation until the events of &quot;Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983). 

The Solo family is part of the Skywalker family. In the 2018 spin-off film &quot;&quot; (set between &quot;Episode III&quot; and 1977&#x27;s &quot;Episode IV – A New Hope&quot;), orphan Han Solo steals to survive on the planet Corellia. The last-name &quot;Solo&quot; is given to him by an Imperial Officer in his application to join the Imperial Flight Academy. Since the last-name of Han&#x27;s father is unknown, Han would be the first Solo. Han would later be involved in the war against the Empire, forming a romantic relationship with Leia. Eventually, Han, Anakin (who has now reformed), Luke, and Leia succeeded in putting an end to the Empire&#x27;s reign of terror, but this came at a cost of Anakin&#x27;s life. In the 2015 film &quot;Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens&quot;, it is revealed that Han had a son named Ben with Leia. The family breaks apart following Ben&#x27;s descent into the dark side as Kylo Ren, with Leia and Han separating. Luke is not revealed to have any children.

By the end of &quot;Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019), the Skywalker bloodline has died out, as Han is killed by Kylo Ren after he tries to convince him to return to the light side, Luke sacrifices himself to save the Resistance from the First Order, Leia dies to bring her son back to the light side, and Ben Solo dies to save Rey. Later, Rey adopts &quot;Skywalker&quot; as her surname to honor the Skywalker family and continue their legacy while cutting ties with her Palpatine lineage, making her the last known person alive to carry this surname. Since then, the Skywalkers have become legendary and famous throughout galactic history and for restoring peace to the galaxy.

==Family tree==
==Members==
===Shmi Skywalker-Lars===
Shmi Skywalker (portrayed by Pernilla August) is the mother of Anakin Skywalker, the mother-in-law of Padmé Amidala, the paternal grandmother of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, the grandmother-in-law of Han Solo, and the maternal great-grandmother of Ben Solo. She appears in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;.

Shmi was captured by pirates as a child alongside her parents, and was sold to the Hutts. In a bet, Gardulla the Hutt lost Shmi to Watto.

In &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, she and her son are introduced as slaves of junk merchant Watto on the desert world Tatooine. Unlike her son, she is not Force-sensitive. She welcomes Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) into their home, and tells him that Anakin (Jake Lloyd) has no father; she simply became pregnant with him. In spite of her poverty, Shmi tries to give Anakin a good home in the slave quarter of Mos Espa. Qui-Gon helps Anakin win his freedom, but cannot get Shmi out of slavery. She allows Anakin to leave with Qui-Gon, assuring her heartbroken son that they will meet again.

In &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, Anakin (Hayden Christensen), now a young adult Jedi apprentice, senses through the Force that she is in pain. He travels to Tatooine to find her, and, upon arriving, learns that she had been freed by and married to moisture farmer Cliegg Lars (Jack Thompson), but had recently been kidnapped by Tusken Raiders. He finds her inside one of their encampments, but he arrives too late—beaten and tortured beyond help, she dies in his arms. Heartbroken and enraged by the loss of his mother, Anakin slaughters every single Tusken in the camp, including the women and children. Shmi&#x27;s death ignites a strong anger in Anakin, and sets him on the path to becoming Darth Vader. Anakin later brings Shmi&#x27;s body back to the Lars&#x27; homestead where she is given a burial.

===Anakin Skywalker===

Anakin Skywalker is the son of Shmi Skywalker, the secret husband of Padmé Amidala, the father of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, the father-in-law of Han Solo, and the maternal grandfather of Ben Solo. Anakin is discovered on Tatooine by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn who is sure that the boy is the &quot;Chosen One&quot; of Jedi Prophecy, who will bring balance to the Force. After the death of Qui-Gon, he becomes the Padawan of Obi-Wan Kenobi. He also forms a close bond with Padmé Amidala, the young senator of Naboo. The newly elected Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, Palpatine, also befriends Anakin, promising to watch the boy&#x27;s progress &quot;with great interest&quot; and advise him. Torn between his loyalty to the Jedi and his drive for power, Anakin succumbs to temptation and becomes Darth Vader. As Vader, Anakin spends the following decades serving under Palpatine&#x27;s Galactic Empire until reuniting with his son, Luke, redeeming himself by defeating his master to protect him (therefore, fulfilling his role as the Chosen One) while sacrificing himself in the process and becoming one with the Force.

Anakin Skywalker is played by Sebastian Shaw in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), and his younger self is played by Jake Lloyd in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999) and Hayden Christensen in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) and &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005).

===Padmé Amidala===

Padmé Amidala (portrayed by Natalie Portman) is married to Anakin Skywalker, the mother of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, the daughter-in-law of Shmi Skywalker, the mother-in-law of Han Solo, and the maternal grandmother of Ben Solo. She served as Queen of Naboo, and later as a Senator for her planet. She does not use the Force like most members of the Skywalker family. Her closest friend in the Senate was Senator Bail Organa. She reconnected and fell in love with Anakin Skywalker after he was assigned to protect her from an assassination attempt, and secretly married him shortly after the Battle of Geonosis. Three years later, she reveals to Anakin that she is pregnant and plans to raise their child on Naboo. She realizes that Anakin has started to have nightmares of her dying in childbirth and assures him that it was just a dream and that it won&#x27;t happen. After Anakin turned to the dark side and massacred the Jedi at the Jedi Temple, she was told by Anakin that the Jedi had taken over the Republic. Obi-Wan arrives and asks Padmé about her husband&#x27;s whereabouts and informs her that he has turned to the dark side. Padmé accuses Obi-Wan of lying and doesn&#x27;t believe that Anakin would kill younglings. Obi-Wan states that Anakin is the father of Padmé&#x27;s child and sets off to find him. Padmé tracks Anakin, now Darth Vader, to Mustafar and tries to persuade him to abandon the dark side, but Anakin refuses, and Force chokes her unconscious when Obi-Wan arrives. Padmé gives birth to her children shortly after the first Empire Day, whom she calls Luke and Leia. Padmé tells Obi-Wan that she believes there is still good left in Anakin, before passing away. She was given a state funeral on her home planet of Naboo. Obi-Wan and Yoda decided to separate the children to keep them hidden from Darth Vader.

===Luke Skywalker===

Luke Skywalker (portrayed by Mark Hamill) is the older twin brother of Leia Organa, the brother-in-law of Han Solo, the uncle of Ben Solo, the son of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala, and the grandson of Shmi Skywalker. He is taken in by his uncle and aunt, Owen and Beru Lars, after the death of Padmé and Anakin&#x27;s fall to the dark side. He is Force-sensitive and skilled with a lightsaber. In &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, a dying Yoda confirms to Luke, that Darth Vader (formerly Anakin Skywalker) is actually his father, despite Luke&#x27;s belief that Vader&#x27;s claim to fatherhood in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was a ruse to pull Luke to the dark side. He also finds out from Obi-Wan&#x27;s Force spirit that Princess Leia Organa is his sister. In &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, as the last known Jedi, Luke is in hiding after failing to prevent his nephew and apprentice Ben Solo (now Kylo Ren) from turning to the dark side to join Supreme Leader Snoke and has cut himself off from the Force. In &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;, a young scavenger named Rey has located Luke and tries to convince him to show her the ways of the Force, but he refuses. After knowing the death of Han Solo, he trains Rey about how to use the Force and to become a Jedi. Luke reveals to Rey that he sensed the dark side in Ben and was scared for him, but Ben retaliated by using the Force to collapse the hut, burying him underneath. When he refuses to help Rey turn Ben back to the light, Luke plans to burn the Jedi Library tree and is greeted by Yoda, who convinces him to help Rey and not to mourn his failure of losing Ben to Snoke. On the planet Crait, Luke appears with his old lightsaber and duels Ben, who tries to attack Luke, but he dodges him. Luke tries to reason with Ben and then disappears, revealing that he was still on the island and that Ben was dueling a Force projection of him. Luke falls to the ground and gets up, and afterwards dies after disappearing, becoming one with the Force.

===Leia Organa===
Leia Organa (portrayed by Carrie Fisher) is married to Han Solo, the mother of Ben Solo, the younger twin sister of Luke Skywalker, the daughter of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala, and the granddaughter of Shmi Skywalker, raised by Bail and Breha Organa of Alderaan. At age 19, she is the Princess of Alderaan, and is captured by Darth Vader while in the Tantive IV blockade runner on a so-called &quot;diplomatic mission&quot;. Leia is shown to be Force-sensitive. In &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Leia professes her love for Han Solo when he is put into carbonite stasis, although it is originally Han and Luke who compete for her affections. In &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, planning to feed Luke, Han, and Chewbacca to the flesh eating Sarlacc, Jabba the Hutt is instead strangled to death by Leia by a chain he has on her. She later becomes involved in the Battle of Endor. In the years that follow, she becomes General Organa, the leader of the Resistance, a military organization unofficially backed by the New Republic to counter the First Order. She married Han Solo and had a son named Ben Solo, later Kylo Ren, whose turning to the dark side separated the couple before the events of &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;. Leia has been on a search to find her missing brother Luke and find a way to save her son from the dark side. She dies spending her energy trying to reach Ben, which helps him come back to the light side. Her body later disappears and she becomes one with the Force.

===Han Solo===

Han Solo (portrayed by Harrison Ford) is married to Leia Organa, the brother-in-law of Luke Skywalker, the father of Ben Solo, the son-in-law of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala, and the grandson-in-law of Shmi Skywalker. Like Shmi and Padmé, he is not Force-sensitive. The anthology film &quot;&quot; reveals that Han Solo&#x27;s father constructed ships on the planet Corellia, where Han was born. The name of Han&#x27;s father is not known. Han&#x27;s surname, Solo, was not his birth name, with Han being given his Solo surname by an Imperial officer right before Han joined the Imperial flight academy, which he would leave three years after. Han Solo&#x27;s first film appearance however was in 1977&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: A New Hope&quot; where he is played by Harrison Ford. He and his Wookiee co-pilot and best friend, Chewbacca, are initially hired to transport Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Han and Chewbacca later become involved in the Rebel Alliance and are committed to its cause. Over the course of the franchise, Han becomes a military leader for the Alliance, falling in love with and marrying Leia Organa, with whom he has a son named Ben. He is killed by Ben, who has become Kylo Ren, after failing to convince his son to turn from the dark side.

===Ben Solo===

Ben Solo (portrayed by Adam Driver) is the son of Leia Organa and Han Solo, the nephew of Luke Skywalker, the grandson of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala, and the great-grandson of Shmi Skywalker. He initially trains to be a Jedi under his uncle, Luke. Soon, Luke suspects Ben has been influenced by Snoke, and ignites his lightsaber because of instinct in an attempt to kill Ben in his sleep to prevent him from causing destruction. But when he thinks about killing Ben, Ben wakes up and this causes Ben to fall to the dark side. Ben becomes Kylo Ren, working for the First Order and working under the influence of Snoke. He also forms an uneasy alliance with General Hux. Ren is obsessed with the legacy of his grandfather, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, and aspires to finish what Vader started: the elimination of the Jedi. He stabs Han Solo, his father, in the heart but spares his mother when ordered to destroy her ship. Ben becoming Kylo Ren also caused Han and Leia to break up, but neither of them stopped loving their son. Luke confronts him and also disappears trying to stop Ben&#x27;s actions. Kylo also meets Rey, a strong Force-sensitive with whom he has a connection called &#x27;dyad in the Force&#x27;, and he develops a romantic relationship with her despite the two being enemies at first. After his mother&#x27;s death, Rey saves his life and admits to him she does want to join him as Ben Solo; he then sees a vision of his father and decides to come back to the light side, becoming Ben Solo again. Later, he sacrifices himself to bring Rey back to life, and shares a kiss with her before vanishing into the Force as the last of the Skywalker bloodline.
===Extended family of the Skywalkers===

==&quot;Legends&quot;==
The following characters are exclusive to what is now retroactively known as the &quot;Legends&quot; brand since April 2014, and non-canonical to any and all &quot;Star Wars&quot; material produced under the ownership of the Walt Disney Company. With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe material produced since the originating 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; was rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.

Following the events of the original film trilogy, Leia and Han marry and have children, and Luke does likewise several years after they do. The Skywalker bloodline branches from Luke and Leia&#x27;s descendants, but only Luke&#x27;s side continues to carry the Skywalker name.

Leia and Han marry in &quot;The Courtship of Princess Leia&quot; (1994) by Dave Wolverton. Leia is pregnant with twins in Timothy Zahn&#x27;s &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; (1991) and they are born in Zahn&#x27;s &quot;The Last Command&quot; (1993). Han and Leia have another child by the time of the &quot;Jedi Academy&quot; trilogy (1994) by Kevin J. Anderson, by which time Leia has become the Chief of State of the New Republic. All three of the Solo children become Jedi Knights under the tutelage of their maternal uncle Luke Skywalker. The Solo children were ranked as the 16th top &quot;Star Wars&quot; heroes, according to IGN in 2008.

Having refounded the Jedi Order and trained several new Jedi including Leia, Luke eventually marries an enemy-turned-ally Mara Jade, and they have a son named Ben, who was voted the 40th top &quot;Star Wars&quot; character by IGN and the 6th top &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe character by UGO Networks.

|style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;|Notes:

===Mara Jade===
Mara Jade was created by Timothy Zahn as an antagonist for &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; (1991), and she and Luke marry several years later in the comic miniseries &quot;Union&quot; (1999-2000). She joins his restored Jedi Order, and they have a son, Ben Skywalker, in the middle of the &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; series (1999-2003).

===Jaina Solo===

Jaina Solo is the eldest child of Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo, created by Timothy Zahn for the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy of &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe novels. Leia is pregnant with twins in &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; (1991) and Jaina and her twin brother Jacen are born in &quot;The Last Command&quot; (1993). She has appeared in various novels and the &quot;Champions of the Force&quot; set for the &quot;Star Wars Miniatures&quot; game.

Jaina, named after Han&#x27;s mother, is born five minutes before her brother Jacen in the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy (1991–93), set about five years after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. The twins, and eventually their younger brother, live at various safe havens for their first few years under the protection of Leia&#x27;s handmaiden Winter. The twins play a small role in Kevin J. Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Jedi Academy&quot; trilogy (1994). In &quot;Champions of the Force&quot; (1994), Jaina helps her brother defend their unconscious uncle from the spirit of Sith Lord Exar Kun. In Vonda McIntyre&#x27;s &quot;The Crystal Star&quot; (1994), Jaina is kidnapped and used in a plot, along with her siblings, to take advantage of their Force powers. In the Corellian trilogy (1994), Jaina is again kidnapped but escapes. Jaina becomes a major character in &quot;Young Jedi Knights&quot; (1995) as Jaina and Jacen begin their Jedi training.

Throughout the &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; series (1999–2003), Jaina pursues a life separate from her twin brother and becomes Mara Jade Skywalker&#x27;s apprentice. Jaina progresses quickly as a Jedi and a pilot, eventually joining Rogue Squadron. She also develops a romantic relationship with Jagged Fel. She briefly becomes the apprentice of fallen Jedi Kyp Durron. Jaina&#x27;s understanding and manipulation of Yuuzhan Vong technology causes them to associate her with their trickster goddess. She is present at the conclusion of the war with the Yuuzhan Vong. Walter Jon Williams, author of &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Way&quot; (2002), noted that the plot concerning Jaina&#x27;s love life caused some frantic rewrites. Elaine Cunningham, author of the &quot;Dark Journey&quot;, commented that the story of the 2002 novel is a personal one focusing on a difficult time in Jaina&#x27;s life.

In &quot;The Joiner King&quot; (2005), Jaina and the Jedi Zekk are joined in the Killik hive. Jacen tricks them into attacking a Chiss base to provoke a war between the Chiss and the Killiks; Jaina, furious, vows that she will never fly with Jacen again. In the &quot;Legacy of the Force&quot; series (2006–08), Jacen throws Jaina out of the Galactic Alliance when she refuses to follow his order to destroy a crippled ship. She senses at this time a growing darkness in her twin. In &quot;Betrayal&quot; (2006), Jacen falls to the dark side of the Force, and Jaina realizes her duty as the &quot;Sword of the Jedi&quot; requires her to stop him. She turns to Boba Fett to train her. In &quot;Invincible&quot; (2008), Jaina duels and kills Jacen.

In the &quot;Fate of the Jedi&quot; series (2009–12), Jaina is promoted to Jedi Master by Luke Skywalker, and marries Jagged Fel. Her and Jagged&#x27;s descendants include Emperor Roan Fel and his daughter Marasiah Fel in the &quot;Legacy&quot; series (2006–14), set nearly 140 years after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

In 2017, Hasbro released a 6&quot; Jaina figure as a part of its Black Series line.

===Jacen Solo===

Jacen Solo is the middle child of Han Solo and Leia Organa, Jacen was born five minutes after his twin sister Jaina, introduced &quot;in utero&quot; in the 1994 &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe novel &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;, and born and named in &quot;The Last Command&quot;. He is a major character in several &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels, particularly as the protagonist of &quot;The New Jedi Order&quot; series and later as the antagonist of the &quot;Legacy of the Force&quot; series, in which he becomes known as Darth Caedus.

IGN listed Jacen as #17 on their list of the top 100 &quot;Star Wars&quot; heroes, saying that he had a more &quot;profound effect&quot; than any other Solo children on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; setting. Jesse Schedeen, writing for IGN, also listed him as #5 in a reader-inspired list of top &quot;Star Wars&quot; villains, and named the character&#x27;s murder of Mara Jade as his &quot;defining moment of villainy&quot;. UGO.com listed Jacen as their top &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe character, calling him &quot;one of the most fearsome—and most tragic—villains in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe&quot;.

===Anakin Solo===
Anakin Solo is the youngest child born to Han Solo and Princess Leia, and the younger brother of Jacen and Jaina Solo. Anakin is named after his maternal grandfather, Anakin Skywalker, and, like his namesake, is a talented pilot who is prodigiously gifted both in the Force and mechanical engineering.

Anakin appears as an infant and toddler in many &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels such as the &quot;Jedi Academy&quot; trilogy (1994). Anakin and his siblings play central roles in other novels such as &quot;The Crystal Star&quot; (1994), the &quot;Corellian&quot; trilogy (1995) and &quot;The New Rebellion&quot; (1996). Anakin&#x27;s birth is featured in Tom Veitch&#x27;s &quot;Dark Empire II&quot; comic book miniseries (May 1995). He is first referred to as Han Solo, Jr. by his father, but Leia corrects him, having named the baby after her biological father, Anakin Skywalker, as a reminder of hope. However, Anakin still fears the name and his grandfather&#x27;s legacy.

On October 1, 1995, Nancy Richardson started the &quot;Junior Jedi Knights&quot; series with &quot;The Golden Globe&quot; starring Anakin and his best friend Tahiri Veila. Anakin is now an eleven-year-old child starting his training at the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4. Richardson continued Anakin&#x27;s adventures in the following two novels, &quot;Lyric&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Promises&quot;, before Rebecca Moesta finished the series with &quot;Anakin&#x27;s Quest&quot;, &quot;Vader&#x27;s Fortress&quot;, and &quot;Kenobi&#x27;s Blade&quot;, starting in 1996. Anakin appears in the &quot;Young Jedi Knights&quot; series by Kevin J. Anderson and Rebecca Moesta, which follows the adventures of Anakin&#x27;s siblings, Jacen and Jaina.

In 1999, the first novel of the &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; series was published, entitled &quot;Vector Prime&quot; by R.A. Salvatore. Anakin is now a teenager, who often spends time alone thinking about the role of the Force, and would get into arguments with his brother Jacen on the ways of a Jedi and the Force. Anakin studies as a Jedi under his uncle, Luke Skywalker, who still sees his nephew as being too young and reckless. In the novel&#x27;s climax, his father&#x27;s copilot and best friend, Chewbacca, dies saving Anakin&#x27;s life.

Anakin plays major roles in &quot;Dark Tide: Onslaught&quot; and &quot;Dark Tide: Ruin&quot; by Michael A. Stackpole published 1 February 2000 and 1 June 2000, respectively, and is the main focus of the books &quot;Edge of Victory: Conquest&quot; and &quot;Edge of Victory: Rebirth&quot; by Greg Keyes published April 1, 2001 and August 1, 2001, respectively.

In the 2001 novel &quot;Star by Star&quot; by Troy Denning, Anakin leads a team of Jedi to take out a dangerous enemy, resulting in his death. Writers of the &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; storyline revealed in a question-and-answer section of the paperback edition of &quot;The Unifying Force&quot; published on August 3, 2004 that Anakin was supposed to be the hero of the story and lead the Jedi Order, but this was changed due to the release of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel films, in which the hero was also named &quot;Anakin&quot;. Instead, he dies in battle at the conclusion of the novel.

Even after his death, Anakin Solo has been mentioned several times in most following novels, including a possible appearance in &quot;Traitor&quot; by Matthew Stover, as a droid in &quot;Betrayal&quot; by Aaron Allston as Anakin Sal-Solo, and in &quot;Backlash&quot;, where he appeared to his maternal uncle Luke Skywalker and to Luke&#x27;s son, Ben Skywalker by Aaron Allston.

Anakin is portrayed in the earlier books as being a genius and a loner, but is haunted by his name. In &quot;Lyric&#x27;s World&quot;, it is revealed that he loves to take computers apart and put them back together and sees it as a puzzle. He would also have dreams of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader trying to persuade him to fall to the dark side of the Force; Anakin overcomes this fear in &quot;Anakin&#x27;s Quest&quot;, in which he confronts himself.

===Ben Skywalker===
Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade Skywalker&#x27;s son. Named after Obi-Wan &quot;Ben&quot; Kenobi, Jedi Knight. Former student of Jacen Solo, his cousin. He inherits his mother&#x27;s red hair and his father&#x27;s blue eyes. He is born during the &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; series (1999–2003). In &quot;Fate of the Jedi: Outcast&quot;, he voluntarily accompanies his father into exile. He proves himself as both a fighter and as an investigator to carry on his father&#x27;s name. His love interest is Vestara Khai, formerly a Sith apprentice, then a Jedi apprentice. The character was voted the 40th top &quot;Star Wars&quot; character by IGN and the 6th top &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe character by UGO Networks.

===Allana Djo Solo===
Allana Djo Solo is the daughter of Jacen Solo and Tenel Ka Djo, Jacen&#x27;s fellow trainee at Luke&#x27;s Jedi Academy. She is born during the &quot;Dark Nest&quot; trilogy of novels. In the &quot;Legacy of the Force&quot; series, Jacen becomes Darth Caedus partly to protect Allana from a dark fate which he foresees. Her death is faked and she is adopted by her grandparents under the false identity of &quot;Amelia&quot;, a supposed war orphan. She lives and travels with them during the following series &quot;Fate of the Jedi&quot;. By the end of that series, her Jedi training is about to begin.

===Roan and Marasiah Fel===
In the &quot;Star Wars: Legacy&quot; comic series, set over 120 years after the original trilogy, some of Leia&#x27;s descendants have since become the ruling dynasty of a reformed, more benevolent Empire. The first volume (2006-2010) recounts their struggles against a new Sith Order. Emperor Roan Fel is Leia&#x27;s great-grandson, Jaina Solo&#x27;s grandson and the head of the Imperial Knights (who split from the Jedi refounded by Luke, but are still opposed to the dark side). Marasiah Fel is his daughter and an imperial Knight herself. They oppose the new Sith Order who have taken over most of the galaxy, and ally with Cade Skywalker and the surviving Jedi and Republic forces in order to fight them.

===Nat Skywalker===
Nat Skywalker is a former Jedi Master in &quot;Star Wars: Legacy&quot;, a grandson of Ben Skywalker, older brother of Kol Skywalker and the uncle of Cade Skywalker. He took the name Bantha Rawk upon leaving the Jedi and works as a mechanic.

===Kol Skywalker===
Kol Skywalker is a character in &quot;Star Wars: Legacy&quot;. A Jedi Master, he is the younger brother of Nat Skywalker and a grandson of Ben Skywalker (they share the same red hair color, and has green eyes like Ben&#x27;s mother Mara Jade), he is the father of Cade Skywalker.

===Ania Solo===
The second volume of &quot;Star Wars: Legacy&quot; (2013-2014) follows Ania Solo, the great-granddaughter of Leia and granddaughter of Jacen Solo. She is a junkyard trader who is embroiled in the continuing conflict between the new Sith and the Republic-Imperial alliance.

===Cade Skywalker===
Cade Skywalker is the descendant of Anakin Skywalker, Luke Skywalker, Mara Jade Skywalker and Ben Skywalker, the son of Kol Skywalker and the nephew of Nat Skywalker. He is a protagonist of the &quot;Star Wars: Legacy&quot; comic book series from Dark Horse, which takes place 125 years after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Cade has completely abandoned the Jedi way after an attack by the New Sith Order on the Jedi Academy on Ossus. Despite this, he still encounters other Jedi, as well as the ghost of his ancestor Luke Skywalker, and ultimately reclaims his heritage to fight the Sith. The character was voted the 84th top &quot;Star Wars&quot; character by IGN.

<text>Richard Watson Dixon (5 May 1833 – 23 January 1900), English poet and divine, son of Dr James Dixon, a Wesleyan minister.

==Biography==
He was the eldest son of Dr. James Dixon, a distinguished Wesleyan preacher, by Mary, only daughter of the Rev. Richard Watson. 
In the biography he wrote of his father, Dixon describes his mother as &#x27;an excellent Latin and Greek scholar, a perfect French and a sufficient Italian linguist, and an exquisite musician;&#x27; and of his grandmother, Mrs. Watson, who made a home with her daughter, he retained an affectionate recollection as of a very good and clever woman. 
Both the Watsons and Dixons belonged to the early school of Methodists, who did not renounce their membership in the church of England, so that there was no feeling that Dixon had been disloyal to their communion when he prepared for orders in the church.
He was born on 5 May 1833 at Islington, and educated, under Dr. Gifford, at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, where he had for school friends Edwin Hatch and Edward Burne-Jones. 
In June 1851, he matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, and when in the Christmas term of the same year Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris came up to Exeter College, they, with William Fulford, Charles Faulkner, Cormell Price, and a few more, formed a close brotherhood. 
An excellent account of these Oxford days was contributed by Dixon to Mr. J. W. Mackail&#x27;s &quot;Life of Morris&quot;. 
He says ‘Jones and Morris were both meant for holy orders, and the same may be said of the rest of us except Faulkner; but the bond of alliance was poetry and indefinite artistic and literary aspirations. 
We all had the notion of doing great things for men according to our own will and bent.’ 
With Morris, Dixon projected &quot;The Oxford and Cambridge Magazine&quot;, and had a hand, under Rossetti&#x27;s direction, in the amateur distempering of the walls of Woodward&#x27;s new debating hall at the Oxford Union with frescoes from the Arthurian Romances, now almost completely obliterated. 
Dixon did not in after life pursue painting as a study—a single canvas, a wedding-scene from Chaucer, is, it is believed, the only picture of his that survives —but he always retained his interest, and a visit to the old masters in the National Gallery was a regular incident of any visit to London. 
At Oxford Dixon read for the ordinary classical schools, and graduated B.A. in 1857. 
The next year he won the Arnold historical prize for an essay on ‘The Close of the Tenth Century of the Christian Era,’ and in 1863 Oxford&#x27;s Sacred Poem Prize, the subject being ‘St. John in Patmos.’ 
The poem is in the heroic couplet, and is a very dignified and impressive piece of writing. His first published volume of poems, called ‘Christ&#x27;s Company,’ had already appeared in 1861, and a second, ‘Historical Odes,’ followed in 1863. 
These early poems of Dixon were distinguished by not a little of the colour and imagination, and also by something of the eccentricity, that marked the early efforts of the Pre-Raphaelite school.
The poems of the first volume, though largely upon religious subjects, are not strictly religious poetry; they are works of picturesque imagination rather than of devotional feeling. The ‘Historical Odes’ show an advance in simplicity, and a power, that Dixon afterwards carried further, of ode construction. The odes upon Wellington and Marlborough contain much good writing, and deserve more attention than they have received.
After leaving Oxford, Dixon lodged for a time with Morris and Burne-Jones in Red Lion Square. In 1858, he was ordained to the curacy of St. Mary-the-Less, Lambeth, Mr. Gregory, the present dean of St. Paul&#x27;s, giving him his title. 
In 1861, he moved to the curacy of St. Mary, Newington Butts, and became an assistant master at Highgate School, where his pupils included Gerard Manley Hopkins. 
From 1863 to 1868 he was second master at Carlisle High School, and from 1868 to 1875 minor canon and honorary librarian of Carlisle Cathedral. 
After that he was for eight years vicar of Hayton, in Cumberland, and was then presented by the bishop of Carlisle to the vicarage of Warkworth in Northumberland, which he held till his death. 
Besides these small livings, Dixon received no preferment in the church, although the best years of his life were devoted to writing a church history, which took rank from the first moment of its appearance as a standard authority. 
His friends would have greatly valued for him the increase of leisure and opportunities for study which a cathedral stall would have afforded; but it was not to be. 
The distinctions which he received after the appearance of the first volume of his history, in 1877, were such as to reduce the already scanty leisure of a hardworked parish clergyman.

In 1874, he had been made honorary canon of Carlisle; in 1879 he became rural dean of Brampton; in 1884 rural dean of Alnwick; and in 1891 examining chaplain to the bishop of Newcastle. 
He was chaplain to the high sheriff of Cumberland in 1883, and from 1890 to 1894 was a proctor in convocation. 
He was always singularly modest as to his claims upon recognition; but it gave him genuine pleasure when in the last year of his life his university conferred upon him an honorary doctor&#x27;s degree in divinity, and his college made him an honorary fellow. 
In 1885, he stood for the professorship of poetry at Oxford, but withdrew his candidature before the election. 
The short preface to &#x27;Eudocia and her Brothers&#x27; upon the use of the heroic couplet shows that he possessed keen critical powers and a faculty of lucid exposition.
Dixon was briefly considered for Poet Laureate when Alfred Tennyson died in 1892.

In December 1891 Dixon had a severe attack of influenza, which for some long time diminished his power of writing, but he ultimately recovered; a second attack in January 1900 carried him off after a few days&#x27; illness.

==Family==
On 9 April 1861, he married the widow of William Thomson of Haddingtonshire (née Maria Sturgeon). 
His first wife having died in 1876, Dixon married in 1882 Matilda, eldest daughter of George Routledge. 
He had no children by either marriage; but he proved an affectionate step-father to the daughters of his first wife.

<text>The Space Needle is an observation tower in Seattle, Washington, United States. Considered to be an icon of the city, it has been designated a Seattle landmark. Located in the Lower Queen Anne neighborhood, it was built in the Seattle Center for the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair, which drew over 2.3 million visitors.

At high, the Space Needle was once the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River in the United States. The tower is wide, weighs , and is built to withstand winds of up to and earthquakes of up to 9.0 magnitude, as strong as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake.

Elevators take visitors to an observation deck above ground in 41 seconds, which offers panoramic views of the downtown Seattle skyline, the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Elliott Bay, and various islands in Puget Sound. On April 19, 1999, the city&#x27;s Landmarks Preservation Board designated the tower a historic landmark.

==Architecture==

The architecture of the Space Needle is the result of a compromise between the designs of two people, Edward E. Carlson and John Graham, Jr. The two leading ideas for the World Fair involved businessman Edward E. Carlson&#x27;s sketch (on a napkin) of a giant balloon tethered to the ground (the gently sloping base) and architect John Graham&#x27;s concept of a flying saucer (that houses the restaurant and observation deck). Victor Steinbrueck introduced the hourglass profile of the tower and its tripod design, which resembles the isthmus that Seattle is situated on. The Space Needle was built to withstand Category 5-plus wind speeds of , double the requirements in the building code of 1962, swaying only per of wind speed.

While the 2001 6.8 Nisqually earthquake jolted the Needle enough for water to slosh out of the toilets in the restrooms, the structure is designed to avoid serious structural damage in earthquakes of magnitudes below 9.1.

For decades, the hovering disk of the Space Needle was home to two restaurants above the ground: the Space Needle Restaurant, which was originally named Eye of the Needle, and Emerald Suite. These were closed in 2000 to make way for SkyCity, a larger restaurant that features Pacific Northwest cuisine, which closed in 2017. In 1993, the elevators were replaced with new computerized versions. The new elevators descend at a rate of .

On December 31, 1999, a powerful beam of light was unveiled for the first time. Known as the Legacy Light or Skybeam, it is powered by lamps that total 85 million candela shining skyward from the top of the Space Needle to honor national holidays and special occasions in Seattle. The concept of this beam was derived from the official 1962 World&#x27;s Fair poster, which depicted such a light source although none was incorporated into the original design. It is somewhat controversial because of the light pollution it creates. Originally planned to be turned on 75 nights per year, it has generally been used fewer than a dozen times per year. It did remain lit for eleven days in a row from September 11, 2001, to September 22, 2001, in response to the September 11, 2001, attacks.

A 1962 Seattle World&#x27;s Fair poster showed a grand spiral entryway leading to the elevator that was ultimately omitted from final building plans. The main stairwell has 848 steps from the basement to the top of the observation deck.
At approximately , the Space Needle was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River at the time it was built by Howard S. Wright Construction Co., but is now dwarfed by other structures along the Seattle skyline alone, among them the Columbia Center, at . Unlike many other similar structures, such as the CN Tower in Toronto, the Space Needle is not used for broadcasting purposes.

==History==
===Construction===
Edward E. Carlson, chairman of the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair in Seattle, had an idea for erecting a tower with a restaurant at the World&#x27;s Fair. The president of Western International Hotels, he had been inspired by a recent visit to the Stuttgart Tower in Germany. Local architect John Graham soon became involved as a result of his success in designing Northgate Mall. Graham&#x27;s first move was to alter the restaurant&#x27;s original design to a revolving restaurant, similar to his previous design of the La Ronde tower restaurant at the Ala Moana Center in Honolulu. Among the names proposed for the structure by Carlson, Graham, and Steinbrueck were the &quot;Space Needle&quot;, &quot;Star Tickler&quot;, &quot;Top Hat&quot;, and &quot;Big Skookum&quot;.

The proposed Space Needle had no pre-selected site. Since it was not financed by the city, land had to be purchased within the fairgrounds. The investors had been unable to find suitable land and the search for a site was nearly dead when, in 1961, they discovered a lot, , containing switching equipment for the fire and police alarm systems. The land, which originally had the neighborhood&#x27;s fire station until 1921, was sold by the city for $75,000. Geotechnical engineers quickly tested and approved the site for construction. At this point, only one year remained before the World&#x27;s Fair would begin. The Needle was privately financed and built by the Pentagram Corporation, consisting of Bagley Wright, contractor Howard S. Wright, architect John Graham, Ned Skinner, and Norton Clapp. In 1977 Bagley, Skinner, and Clapp sold their interest to the Howard Wright Company, which now controls it under the name of Space Needle Corporation.

The concrete base of the Space Needle is deep and across, and took 467 redi-mix trucks one full day to fill. The foundation weighs (including of reinforcing steel), the same as the above-ground structure. The tower is secured to the foundation with 72 long bolts. 

With time an issue, the construction team worked around the clock. The domed top, housing the top five levels (including the restaurants and observation deck), was perfectly balanced so that the restaurant could rotate with the help of one tiny electric motor, originally , later replaced with a motor. Painted in Orbital Olive paint for the body, Astronaut White for the legs, Re-entry Red for the saucer, and Galaxy Gold for the roof, the Space Needle was finished in less than one year. It was completed in April 1962 at a cost of $4.5 million. The last elevator car was installed the day before the Fair opened on April 21. During the course of the Fair, nearly 20,000 people a day rode to the Observation Deck, cumulating to a total of 2.56 million visitors. Upon completion, the Space Needle was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River, replacing the Kansas City Power and Light Building which had held that distinction since 1931. It also replaced the Smith Tower in downtown Seattle as the tallest building on the American west coast, which it had been since 1914.

The revolving restaurant was operated by Carlson&#x27;s Western International Hotels under a 20-year contract from April 1, 1962, to April 1, 1982.

===Carillon===
An imitation carillon (using recordings of bells, rather than live bells) was installed in the Space Needle, and played several times a day during the World&#x27;s Fair. The instrument, built by the Schulmerich Bells Company of Hatfield, Pennsylvania under the name &quot;Carillon Americana&quot;, recreated the sounds of 538 bells and was the largest in the world, until eclipsed by a 732 bell instrument at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The operator&#x27;s console was located in the base of the Space Needle, completely enclosed in glass to allow observation of the musician playing the instrument. It was also capable of being played from a roll, like a player piano. The forty-four stentors (speakers) of the carillon were located underneath the Needle&#x27;s disc at the level and were audible over the entire fairgrounds and up to away. The carillon was disassembled after the fair&#x27;s close.

The Carillon Americana was featured on a 12-track LP record called &quot;Bells On High-Fi&quot; (catalog number AR-8, produced by Americana Records, of Sellersville, Pennsylvania). These studio recordings were performed by noted carillonneur John Klein (1915-1981).

===After the Fair===
A radio broadcast studio was built on the observation level of the Space Needle in 1963. It was used for morning broadcasts by Radio KING and its sister TV station KING-TV from July 1963 to May 1966, and KIRO Radio from 1966 to 1974. Disc jockey Bobby Wooten of country music station KAYO-AM lived in an apartment built adjacent to the Space Needle&#x27;s broadcast studio for six months in 1974, which required a permit variance from the city government.

On March 27, 1964, the restaurant atop the Space Needle stopped rotating as a result of the 9.2 earthquake in Alaska.

In 1974, author Stephen Cosgrove&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Wheedle on the Needle&quot; imagined a furry creature called the Wheedle who lived on top of the Space Needle and caused its light to flash. Its closing quatrain is: &quot;There&#x27;s a Wheedle on the Needle / I know just what you&#x27;re thinking / But if you look up late at night / You&#x27;ll see his red nose blinking.&quot; The Wheedle has since become a fixture of Seattle. It became the mascot of the Seattle SuperSonics National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise, which played in nearby KeyArena (now Climate Pledge Arena). The SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City on July 3, 2008.

In 1982, the SkyLine level was added at the height of . Although it was part of the original plans for the Space Needle, it was not built until that time. Today, the SkyLine Banquet Facility can accommodate groups of 20–360 people.

On April 19, 1999, the Space Needle was designated as a city historic landmark by the Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board 37 years after it opened. It was the youngest historic landmark in the city. Renovations were completed in 2000 at a cost ($21 million) approximately the same in inflated dollars as the original construction price. Renovations between 1999 and 2000 included the SkyCity restaurant, SpaceBase retail store, Skybeam installation, Observation Deck overhaul, lighting additions, and repainting.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve, the Space Needle hosts a fireworks show at midnight; Alberto Navarro, a fireworks artist from Bellevue, is the lead architect of the show, which is viewed by thousands from the Seattle Center grounds, and televised by KING-TV. In 2000, public celebrations were canceled because of perceived terror threats against the structure after investigations into the foiled millennium bombing plots, but the fireworks show was still held. The 2020 fireworks display was canceled and replaced by a light show due to high winds, while the 2021 display was canceled and replaced by a broadcast-only augmented reality show due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The fireworks display returned for 2022, but the Seattle Center grounds were closed to the public due to state proof of vaccination rules, and the television broadcast included augmented reality effects.

In 2002, a real estate consultant in Bellevue proposed the construction of five smaller replicas of the Space Needle around the city to promote tourism, though official plans to build the proposed structures have not yet materialized.

On May 19, 2007, the Space Needle welcomed its 45 millionth visitor, Greg Novoa from California, who received a free trip for two to Paris.

In May 2008, the Space Needle received its first professional deep cleaning since the opening of the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair. The monument was pressure washed by Kärcher with water at a pressure of almost and a temperature of approximately . The cleaning was only done at night so that the Space Needle could stay open to the public. No detergents were used in consideration of the Seattle Center and the nearby Experience Music Project.

===50th anniversary and renovation===
As part of the celebration of its 50th anniversary in April 2012, the roof of the Needle was painted &quot;Galaxy Gold&quot;, which is more of an orangish color in practice. This is the same color used when the needle was originally constructed for the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair. This temporary makeover, intended to last through the summer, is not the Needle&#x27;s first: it had the University of Washington (UW) Huskies football team logo painted after the team won the 1992 Rose Bowl. When the game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; taped episodes in Seattle in 1995, it was painted to resemble the titular wheel as part of an intro sequence with Vanna White, It was painted crimson after Washington State won the Apple Cup, was painted red, white, and blue for Memorial Day in 2003, and has been seen with the Seattle SuperSonics and Seattle Mariners colors and logos. The Galaxy Gold paint scheme returned for the Space Needle&#x27;s 60th anniversary in May 2022 and was replaced a year later at a cost of $60,000 to $70,000.

A renovation of the top of the Space Needle began in the summer of 2017, to add an all-glass floor to the restaurant, replace the observation platform windows with floor-to-ceiling glass panels to more closely match the 1962 original concept sketches, as well as upgrade and update the internal systems. Called the Century Project, the work was scheduled to finish by June 2018, at a cost of $100 million in private funds provided by the Wright family, who own the Space Needle. The designer is Olson Kundig Architects and the general contractor is Hoffman Construction Company. The rotating restaurant&#x27;s motor was replaced, the elevator capacity was increased by adding elevators or double-stacking them, and the energy efficiency of the building was improved with the aim of achieving LEED Gold Certification. The temporary scaffold&#x27;s , platform under the top structure was assembled on the ground and then lifted by cables from the ground to the underside of the structure, controlled by 12 operators standing on the platform as it was raised. The platform was made by Safway Services, a company specializing in unique construction scaffolding. One-sixth of the observation deck was closed at a time so that the Space Needle was never completely shut down to the public.

The space reopened in August 2018 as the Loupe, an indoor observation deck with a revolving glass floor. It takes 45 minutes for the observation deck to do a full rotation. Two sets of stairs called the Oculus Stairs were added to connect the two new levels. They were named after the glass oculus at the base of the stairs where the Space Needle elevators can be seen ascending and descending. A café, wine bar, more restrooms, and an additional accessibility elevator to the top observation deck were also added. The three elevators are scheduled to be replaced with new units from Otis—including two double-deck elevators for passengers—during the offseason between September 2023 and May 2025. For the first several months of construction, a temporary enclosure was added above the roof.

==Jumping incidents==
Six parachutists have leaped from the tower since its opening, in a sport known as BASE jumping. This activity is legal only with prior authorization. Four of them were part of an authorized promotion in 1996, and one of the jumpers broke a bone in her back while attempting the stunt. The other two jumped illegally and were arrested.

Paul D. Baker was the first person to jump from the Space Needle, committing suicide on March 4, 1974. Mary Lucille Wolf also jumped from the tower that year, on May 25. Following the two 1974 suicides, netting beneath and improved fencing around the observation deck were installed. In spite of the barrier additions, however, another suicide by Dixie Reeder occurred on July 5, 1978.

==Appearances in TV and film==

As a symbol of the Pacific Northwest, the Space Needle has made numerous appearances in films, TV shows, and other works of fiction. The Space Needle is often used in establishing shots as an economical means of indicating the setting is Seattle. Examples include the TV shows &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Dark Angel&quot;, &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot;, and films &quot;It Happened at the World&#x27;s Fair&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Parallax View&quot; (1974) where it was used as a filming location, and &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; (1993), &quot;Chronicle&quot; (2012). The 1999 film &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; made an absurdist visual gag conflating another icon of Seattle, Starbucks, with the tower, showing the coffee chain&#x27;s name written across the Space Needle&#x27;s saucer placing the villain Doctor Evil&#x27;s base of operations there after his henchman Number 2 shifted the organization&#x27;s resources toward the coffee company. As a visual symbol of Seattle, the Space Needle has been incorporated into the logos of NBA (Seattle Supersonics logo used from 1995 to 2001) WNBA, MLS, and NHL professional sports teams.

The Space Needle has been involved in practical jokes, especially those on April Fools&#x27; Day. In 1989, KING-TV&#x27;s &quot;Almost Live!&quot; reported that the Space Needle had collapsed, causing panicked people to call emergency services and forcing the station to apologize afterwards; the incident was compared to the 1938 radio broadcast of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, which caused panic among some listeners. On April 1, 2015, public radio station KPLU reported that a hoax sign had been erected by a group calling itself the &quot;Borg Collective&quot;, depicting a fake proposed land use action &quot;to construct a 666 unit cube to assimilate&quot; the landmark.

Other TV appearances include The History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Life After People&quot;, in which the tower collapses after 200 years because of corrosion. The tower was also destroyed in the TV miniseries &quot;10.5&quot; when a 7.9 earthquake hits Seattle. The miniseries mistakenly portrays the Needle as crumbling concrete, though the structure is actually made of steel and designed to withstand up to a 9.0 earthquake. The Space Needle was also the site of the first task for the finale of &quot;The Amazing Race 35&quot;, where contestants had to walk atop its roof.

<text>&#x27; (), also known as My Fatherland&quot;&quot;&#x27;, is a set of six symphonic poems composed between 1874 and 1879 by the Czech composer Bedřich Smetana. The six pieces, conceived as individual works, are often presented and recorded as a single work in six movements. They premiered separately between 1875 and 1880. The complete set premiered on 5 November 1882 in Žofín Palace, Prague, under Adolf Čech.

&quot;Má vlast&quot; combines the symphonic poem form, pioneered by Franz Liszt, with the ideals of nationalistic music of the late nineteenth century. Each poem depicts an aspect of Bohemia&#x27;s countryside, history, or legends.

The works have opened the Prague Spring International Music Festival, on the 12 May anniversary of the death of their composer, since 1952.

== Structure ==
&quot;Má vlast&quot; consists of six pieces:
# Vyšehrad (&quot;The High Castle&quot;)
# Vltava (&quot;The Moldau&quot;)
# Šárka
# Z českých luhů a hájů (&quot;From Bohemia&#x27;s Woods and Fields&quot;)
# Tábor
# Blaník

=== Vyšehrad ===

The first poem, &quot;Vyšehrad&quot; (The High Castle), composed between the end of September and 18 November 1874 and premiered on 14 March 1875 at the [Prague] Philharmonic, describes the Vyšehrad castle in Prague which was the seat of the earliest Czech kings. During the summer of 1874, Smetana began to lose his hearing, and total deafness soon followed; he described the gradual, but rapid loss of his hearing in a letter of resignation to the director of the Royal Provincial Czech Theatre, Antonín Čížek. In July 1874 he began hearing anomalous noise and then a permanent buzzing. Not long after the onset he was unable to distinguish individual sounds. At the beginning of October he lost all hearing in his right ear, and finally on 20 October in his left. His treatment was based on maintaining isolation from all sounds, but was unsuccessful.

The poem begins with the sounds of the harp of the mythical singer Lumír, and then crosses over into the tones of the castle&#x27;s arsenal. This section of the music introduces the main motifs, which are used in other parts of the cycle. A four note motif (B–E–D–B) represents the castle of Vyšehrad; this is heard again at the end of &#x27;Vltava&#x27; and once more, to round the whole cycle off, at the conclusion of &#x27;Blaník&#x27;.

In the score two harps are required to perform the opening arpeggios. After a dominant seventh chord, the winds take up the theme, followed by the strings, before the whole orchestra is employed to reach a climax. In the next part, Smetana recalls the story of the castle, using a faster tempo which becomes a march. A seemingly triumphant climax is cut short by a descending passage depicting the collapse of the castle, and the music falls quiet. Then the opening harp material is heard again and the music reminds again of the beauty of the castle, now in ruins. The music ends quietly, depicting the river Vltava flowing below the castle.

Conceived between 1872 and 1874, it is the only piece in the cycle to be mostly completed before Smetana began to go noticeably deaf in the summer of 1874. Most performances last approximately fifteen minutes in duration.

=== Vltava ===

&quot;Vltava&quot;, also known by its English title , and the German , was composed between 20 November and 8 December 1874 and was premiered on 4 April 1875 under Adolf Čech. It is about 13 minutes long, and is in the key of E minor. It is the most well known of the poems, often performed separately from the full work.

In this piece, Smetana uses tone painting to evoke the sounds of one of Bohemia&#x27;s great rivers. In his own words:

The composition describes the course of the Vltava, starting from the two small springs, the Studená and Teplá Vltava, to the unification of both streams into a single current, the course of the Vltava through woods and meadows, through landscapes where a farmer&#x27;s wedding is celebrated, the round dance of the mermaids in the night&#x27;s moonshine: on the nearby rocks loom proud castles, palaces and ruins aloft. The Vltava swirls into the St John&#x27;s Rapids; then it widens and flows toward Prague, past the Vyšehrad, and then majestically vanishes into the distance, ending at the Elbe.

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \key e \minor \time 6/8 \tempo &quot;Allegro commodo non agitato&quot; \partial 8*1 b8-.\p_&quot;dolce&quot; | e4(\&lt; fis8) g4( a8)\! | b4 b8-. b4.--\&lt; | c4.\sf\! c-&gt;\&gt; | b-&gt;\!\p~ b4 b8\&lt;( | a4.)\!\dim a4 a8 | g4( a8 g4) g8(\&lt; | fis4.)\!\&gt; fis4(\!\&gt; fis8-.)\! | e4\&gt; r8\! } &lt;/score&gt;

Vltava contains Smetana&#x27;s most famous tune. It is an adaptation of the melody &quot;La Mantovana&quot;, attributed to the Italian Renaissance tenor Giuseppe Cenci, which, in a borrowed Romanian form, was also the basis for the Israeli national anthem &quot;Hatikvah&quot;. The tune also appears in an old Czech folk song, &quot;Kočka leze dírou&quot; (&quot;The Cat Crawls Through the Hole&quot;); Hanns Eisler used it for his &quot;&quot;; and Stan Getz performed it as &quot;Dear Old Stockholm&quot; (possibly through another derivative of the original tune, &quot;Ack Värmeland du sköna&quot;). Horst Jankowski played a syncopated version of the tune on his easy listening hit, &quot;A Walk in the Black Forest.&quot;

The piece is featured in Don Hertzfeldt&#x27;s short film &quot;Everything Will Be OK&quot; (2006) and in Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; (2011).

=== Šárka ===
The third poem was finished on 20 February 1875 and is named for the female warrior Šárka, a central figure in the ancient Czech legend of &quot;The Maidens&#x27; War&quot;. Šárka ties herself to a tree as bait and waits to be saved by the princely knight Ctirad, deceiving him into believing that she is an unwilling captive of the rebelling women. Once released by Ctirad, who has quickly fallen in love with her, Šárka serves him and his comrades with drugged mead and once they have fallen asleep she sounds a hunting horn: an agreed signal to the other women. The poem ends with the warrior maidens falling upon and murdering the sleeping men. It was first performed under the baton of Adolf Čech (sources disagree whether this was on 10 December 1876 or 17 March 1877).

=== Z českých luhů a hájů ===
Smetana finished composing this piece, commonly translated as &quot;From Bohemia&#x27;s Woods and Fields&quot; or &quot;From Bohemian Fields and Groves&quot;, on 18 October 1875, and it received its first public performance nearly eight weeks later, on 10 December. A depiction of the beauty of the Czech countryside and its people, the tone poem tells no real story. The first part is dedicated to the grandeur of the forest with a surprising fugue in the strings, interrupted by a soft woodland melody of the horns, which is later taken over by the whole orchestra. In the second part, a village festival is depicted in full swing. This tone poem was originally written to be the finale of &quot;Má vlast&quot;.

=== Tábor ===
This piece, which was finished on 13 December 1878 and premiered on 4 January 1880, is named after the town of Tábor in South Bohemia founded by the Hussites and serving as their centre during the Hussite Wars. The theme for the piece is quoted from the first two lines of the Hussite hymn, &quot;Ktož jsú boží bojovníci&quot; (&quot;Ye Who Are Warriors of God&quot;).
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \time 3/2 \key d \minor d\ff-. d-. d2-&gt; d-&gt; | r r d\ff | e4-.-&gt; c-. c1-&gt; } &lt;/score&gt;

=== Blaník ===

Blaník was finished on 9 March 1879 and premiered on 4 January 1880. It is named for the mountain Blaník inside which a legend says that a huge army of knights led by St. Wenceslaus sleep. The knights will awake and help the country in its gravest hour (sometimes described as four hostile armies attacking from all cardinal directions).

Musically, &quot;Blaník&quot; begins exactly as &quot;Tábor&quot; ends, &quot;hammering&quot; out the motto which was left unresolved, but now continuing on, as if in the aftermath of the battle. Thus these last two tone poems of the cycle form a cohesive pair, as do the first two; the High Castle&#x27;s theme returns as the Vltava&#x27;s river journey triumphantly reaches that same destination, and again returns triumphantly at the end of &quot;Blaník&quot;. Once again, the Hussite hymn used in Tábor is quoted, though this time it is the third line which rings out in the march at the end of the piece. The original lyrics to this line in the hymn are &quot;so that finally with Him you will always be victorious&quot;, a reference to the eventual victorious rise of the Czech state.
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef bass \time 3/2 \key d \major d-&gt;\fff d-&gt; d2-&gt; d-&gt; | e4-&gt; c-&gt; c2-&gt; r | e4-&gt;-. c-&gt;~ c b-&gt;-. b2-&gt; | a1-&gt;\fz r2 | a4-&gt;\sfz c-&gt; c2-&gt; a-&gt; | a4-&gt; f-&gt; f2-&gt; } &lt;/score&gt;

== Instrumentation ==
The work is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four French horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, triangle, cymbals, two harps, and strings.

<doc id="242947" wikidata="Q11058823" url="?curid=242947" title="Music of Martinique">
<text>The music of Martinique has a heritage which is intertwined with that of its sister island, Guadeloupe. Despite their small size, the islands have created a large popular music industry, which gained in international renown after the success of zouk music in the later 20th century. Zouk&#x27;s popularity was particularly intense in France, where the genre became an important symbol of identity for Martinique and Guadeloupe. Zouk&#x27;s origins are in the folk music of Martinique and Guadeloupe, especially Martinican chouval bwa, and Guadeloupan gwo ka. There&#x27;s also notable influence of the pan-Caribbean calypso tradition and Haitian kompa.

==Folk music==

Carnival is a very important festival, known as Vaval on Martinique. Music plays a vital role, with Martinican big bands marching across the island. Vaval declined following World War II, bouncing back with new band formats and new traditions only in the 1980s. Like Guadeloupe, Martinique features participatory, call-and-response style songs during its Vaval celebrations.

In the early 20th century on Martinique, Creole bands travelled on trucks or small carts during Vaval, playing a music known as &quot;biguine vidé&quot; (or just &quot;videé&quot;). After the decline of Vaval in World War II, the tradition began anew in the 1980s, when large marching bands of fifty or more people became common, including a number of horn players, percussionists and dancers. These large bands, known as &quot;groups à pied&quot;, are each identified with a neighborhood.

===Biguine vidé===
Biguine vidé is an up-tempo version of the biguine rhythm, combining other carnival elements. It participatory music, with the bandleader singing a verse and the audience responding. Modern instrumentation includes a variety of improvised drums made from containers of all kinds, plastic plumbing, bells, tanbou débonda, bélé chacha, tibwa and bélé drums. Aside from the biguine vidé bands, Vaval includes song and costume contests, masquerading and zouk parties.

===Bélé===

The bel air (or bélé) is a legacy of the slave music tradition. The &quot;bélé&quot; itself is a huge tambour drum that players ride as though it was a horse. It is characterized, in its rhythm, by the &quot;tibwa&quot; (two wooden sticks) played on a length of bamboo mounted on a stand to the tambour bélé, and is often accompanied by a &quot;chacha&quot; (a maracas). The &quot;tibwa&quot; rhythm plays a basic pattern and the drum comes to mark the highlights and introduce percussion improvisations.
It is organized in a certain way, the first entry of the singer ( lavwa ) and choir ( lavwa Deye or &quot;answer&quot;). Then the &quot;Bwatè&quot; (player ti bwa) sets the pace, followed by bélé drum. Finally, the dancers take the stage. A dialogue is created between the dancers and the &quot;tanbouyè&quot; (drummer). The &quot;answer&quot; play opposite the singer, the audience can also participate. As a family, together singers, dancers, musicians and audiences are lured by its mesmerizing rhythms. The bélé song-dances include, bélé dous, bélé pitjè, biguine bélé, bélé belya, and gran bélé

The bélé is the origin of several important Martiniquan popular styles, including &quot;chouval bwa&quot; and &quot;biguine&quot;, and also exerted an influence on &quot;zouk&quot;.

Edmond Mondesir is a popular bélé musician from Martinique.

===Chouval bwa===

Chouval bwa is a kind of Martinican traditional music, featuring percussion, bamboo flute, accordion, and comb and paper-type kazoo. The music originated among rural Martinicans, as a form of celebratory holiday music played to accompany a dance called the &quot;manege&quot; (which translates as &quot;merry-go-round&quot;; &quot;chouval bwa&quot; is a Creole version of &quot;cheval bois&quot;, which refers to the wooden horses seen on merry-go-rounds). Chouval bwa percussion is played by a drummer on the &quot;tanbour&quot; drum and the &quot;ti bwa&quot;, a percussion instrument made out of a piece of bamboo laid horizontally and beaten with sticks; the most traditional ensembles also use accordions, &quot;chacha&quot; (a rattle) and the &quot;bel-air&quot;, a bass version of the &quot;tanbour&quot;.

===Quadrille===

In French Caribbean culture, especially of the Lesser Antilles, the term kwadril is a Creole term referring to a folk dance derived from the &quot;quadrille&quot;. kwadril dances are in sets consisting of proper quadrilles, plus creolized versions of 19th-century couple dances: biguines, mazouks and valses Créoles.

Instrumentation consists of variable combinations of accordion, guitar, violin, tanbou dibas, chacha (either a single metal cylinder as in Martinique, or calabash without a handle, held in both hands), malakach (maracas), triangle, bwa (tibwa) and syak, a bamboo rasp one metre long, grooved on both top and bottom, held with one end on the belly and the other on a door or wall and scraped with both hands.

==Popular music==
Though Martinique and Guadeloupe are most frequently known only for the internationally renowned zouk style, the islands have also produced popular musicians in various updated styles of traditional biguine, chouval bwa and gwo ka. The world-famous zouk band Kassav&#x27; remains easily the most famous performers from the island. Chouval bwa has been popularized by Claude Germany, Tumpak, Dédé Saint-Prix, and Pakatak.

Martinique is also the birthplace of the Gibson Brothers who achieved significant chart success worldwide, most notably with their single &quot;Cuba&quot;.

===Biguine===

Biguine is a Martinican form of clarinet and trombone music which can be divided into two distinct types:
*&quot;bidgin bélè&quot; or &quot;drum biguine&quot; – originates in slave bèlè dances and characterized by the use of bélè drums and tibwa rhythm sticks, along with call and response, nasal vocals and improvised instrumental solos; has its roots in West African ritual dances, though ceremonial components do not survive in Haitian biguine.
*&quot;orchestrated biguine&quot; – originates in Saint-Pierre in the 18th century, highly influenced by French music though vocals are usually in creole.

Evolving out of string band music, biguine spread to mainland France in the 1920s. Early stars like Alexandre Stellio and Sam Castandet became popular. Its popularity abroad died relatively quickly, but it lasted as a major force in popular music on Martinique until Haitian compas took over in the 1950s and mini-jazz artists like Les Gentlemen and Les Vikings de Guadeloupe became popular in the late 1960s. In the later part of the 20th century, biguine musicians like clarinet virtuoso Michel Godzom helped revolutionize the genre.

===Cadence (Kadans)/Compas===

In the 1970s, a wave of Haitian, mostly musicians, to Dominica and the French Antilles (Guadeloupe and Martinique) brought with them the kadans &quot;(another word named for the genre compas)&quot;, a sophisticated form of music that quickly swept the island and helped unite all the former French colonies of the Caribbean by combining their cultural influences. These Haitians drew upon previous success from mini-jazz artists like Les Gentlemen, Les Leopards, and Les Vikings de Guadeloupe.

Later in the decade and into the 1980s, the French Antilles became home to a style of cadence music called cadence-lypso. Gordon Henderson&#x27;s Exile One innovated this style, as well as turned the mini-jazz combos into guitar-dominated big bands with a full-horn section and the newly arrived synthesizers, paving the way for the success of large groups like Grammacks, Experience 7, among others. Drawing on these influences, the supergroup Kassav&#x27; invented zouk and popularized it with hit songs like &quot;Zouk-La-Se Sel Medikaman Nou Ni&quot;. Kassav&#x27; formed from Paris in 1978.

===Mini-jazz===
Mini-jazz was formed in the mid-60s characterized by the rock bands formula of two guitars, one bass, drum-conga-cowbell, some use an alto sax or a full horn section, others use a keyboard, accordion or lead guitar. However, all these small jazz or bands had their guitars with sophisticated styles. The 1970s were dominated by mini-jazz, which still used a variant of the méringue style. One of the mini-jazz groups, Tabou Combo, became the most popular ensemble of Haiti. From Haiti the mini-jazz formula replicated in the French Antilles in the 1970s.

===Cadence-lypso===

The most influential figure in the promotion of Cadence-lypso was the Dominican group Exile One (based on the island of Guadeloupe) that featured mostly the cadence rampa of Haiti and calypso music from the English speaking caribbean. It was pushed in the 1970s by groups from Dominica, and was the first style of Dominican music to find international acclaim.

Dominica cadence music has evolved under the influence of Dominican and Caribbean/Latin rhythms, as well as rock and roll, soul, and funk music from the United States.
By the end of the 1970s, Gordon Henderson defined Cadence-lypso as &quot;a synthesis of Caribbean and African musical patterns fusing the traditional with the contemporary&quot;.

Aside from Exile One, other bands included the Grammacks, Black Roots, Black Machine, Naked Feet, Belles Combo, Mantra, Black Affairs, Liquid Ice, Wafrikai, Midnighte Groovers and Milestone, while the most famous singers included Bill Thomas, Chubby Marc, Gordon Henderson, Linford John, Janet Azouz, Sinky Rabess, Tony Valmond, Jeff Joseph, Mike Moreau, Anthony Gussie and Ophelia Marie.

===Zouk===

The inspiration for Zouk&#x27;s style of rhythmic music comes from the Haitian compas, as well as music called cadence-lypso - Dominica cadence popularized by Grammacks and Exile One. Elements of gwo ka, tambour, ti bwa and biguine vidé are prominent in zouk. Though there are many diverse styles of zouk, some commonalities exist. The French Creole tongue of Martinique and Guadeloupe is an important element, and are a distinctive part of the music. Generally, zouk is based around star singers, with little attention given to instrumentalists, and is based almost entirely around studio recordings.

Music authors Charles De Ledesma and Gene Scaramuzzo trace zouk&#x27;s development to the Guadeloupean gwo ka and Martinican bèlè (&quot;tambour&quot; and &quot;ti bwa&quot;)
folk traditions. Ethnomusicologist Jocelyn Guilbault, however, describes zouk as a synthesis of Caribbean popular styles, especially Dominica cadence-lypso, Haitian cadence, Guadeloupean &quot;biguine&quot;. Zouk arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s, using elements of previous styles of Antillean music, as well as imported genres.

===Zouk-love===
Zouk Love is the French Antilles cadence or compas, characterized by a slow, soft and sexual rhythm. The lyrics of the songs often speak of love and sentimental problems.

The music cabo-love from Cape Verde are also derivative of this French Antillean compas style, which sounds basically the same, although there are notable differences once you become more familiar with these genre. A main exponent of this subgenre is Ophelia Marie. Other Zouk Love artists come from the French West Indies, the Netherlands, and Africa.
Popular artists include French West Indian artists Edith Lefel and Nichols, or like Netherlands based Suzanna Lubrano and Gil Semedo, the African artist Kaysha.

===Bouyon (Jump up)===

Bouyon (Boo-Yon) is a form of popular music of Dominica. Bouyon was developed in the 1980s by bands like WCK, combining elements of kadans (or cadence-lypso), lapo kabwit drumming, the folk style jing-ping, and a quick-paced electronic drum pattern. More recently, deejays with raggamuffin-style vocals have moved to the fore, updating the sound for the New Generation.

In Guadeloupe and Martinique, &quot;Jump up&quot; refers generally to bouyon music.

===French Antilles hip hop===

The French Antilles hip hop is a style of hip hop music originating from the French departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean. Usually in French and Antillean creole, the French Antilles hip hop is most popular in the French Antilles and France.

==Music festivals==
Two large, international music festivals have further bolstered Martinique&#x27;s music scene. Jazz à la Martinique and Carrefour Mondial de Guitare alternate years. The country&#x27;s best jazz musicians are featured during Jazz à la Martinique, but major worldwide players like Branford Marsalis also perform. Honoring the guitar, Carrefour Mondial de Guitare celebrates a wide range of guitar genres, including flamenco, blues, jazz, rock, and pop. Both festivals last approximately a week, with concerts in various locations throughout Martinique. Recently, Franck Nicolas presented &quot;Bélé-Jazz&quot;, a style of jazz using the bélé rhythms as its basis.
