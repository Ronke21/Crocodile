<doc id="241409" wikidata="Q752177" url="?curid=241409" title="Astroturfing">
<text>Astroturfing is the deceptive practice of hiding the sponsors of an orchestrated message or organization (e.g., political, economic, advertising, religious, or public relations) to make it appear as though it originates from, and is supported by, unsolicited grassroots participants. It is a practice intended to give the statements or organizations credibility by withholding information about the source&#x27;s financial backers. 

The implication behind the use of the term is that instead of a &quot;true&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; grassroots effort behind the activity in question, there is a &quot;fake&quot; or &quot;artificial&quot; appearance of support. It is increasingly recognized as a problem in social media, e-commerce, and politics. Astroturfing can influence public opinion by flooding platforms like political blogs, news sites, and review websites with manipulated content. Some groups accused of astroturfing argue that they are legitimately helping citizen activists to make their voices heard.

Many countries have laws prohibiting some astroturfing practices with various methods of enforcement. In the US, the FTC has set rules against endorsing a product without disclosing that you are paid to do so. In the EU, social networking sites may be governed by the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive which also prohibits undisclosed paid endorsements and connected individuals from misleading readers into thinking they are regular consumers.

Various detection methods have been developed by researchers, including content analysis, linguistic analysis, authorship attribution, and machine learning.

==Definition==

In political science, it is defined as the process of seeking electoral victory or legislative relief for grievances by helping political actors find and mobilize a sympathetic public, and is designed to create the image of public consensus where there is none. Astroturfing is the use of fake grassroots efforts that primarily focus on influencing public opinion and typically are funded by corporations and political entities to form opinions.

On the internet, astroturfers use software to hide their identity. Sometimes one individual operates through many personas to give the impression of widespread support for their client&#x27;s agenda. Some studies suggest astroturfing can alter public viewpoints and create enough doubt to inhibit action. In the first systematic study of astroturfing in the United States, Oxford Professor Philip N. Howard argued that the internet was making it much easier for powerful lobbyists and political movements to activate small groups of aggrieved citizens to have an exaggerated importance in public policy debates. Astroturfed accounts on social media do not always require humans to write their posts; one January 2021 study detailed a &quot;set of human-looking bot accounts&quot; used to post political content, which was able to operate automatically for fourteen days (and make 1,586 posts) before being detected and suspended by Twitter. Twitter trends are often targeted by astroturfing as they are used as a proxy for popularity. A study conducted by researchers at EPFL reported that 20% of the global Twitter trends in 2019 were fake, created automatically using fake and compromised accounts which tweet in a coordinated way to mimic grassroots organizing of regular Twitter users.

==Policies and enforcement==
Many countries have laws that prohibit more overt astroturfing practices. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may send cease-and-desist orders or require a fine of $16,000 per day for those that violate its &quot;Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising&quot;. The FTC&#x27;s guides were updated in 2009 to address social media and word-of-mouth marketing. According to an article in the &quot;Journal of Consumer Policy&quot;, the FTC&#x27;s guides holds advertisers responsible for ensuring bloggers or product endorsers comply with the guides, and any product endorsers with a material connection are required to provide honest reviews.

In the European Union, the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive requires that paid-for editorial content in the media provide a clear disclosure that the content is a sponsored advertisement. Additionally, it prohibits those with a material connection from misleading readers into thinking they are a regular consumer.

The United Kingdom has the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations, which prohibits &quot;Falsely representing oneself as a consumer.&quot; They allow for up to two years in prison and unlimited fines for breaches. Additionally, the advertising industry in the UK has adopted many voluntary policies, such as the Code of Non-Broadcast Advertising, Sale, Promotion and Direct Marketing. A trade association, the Advertising Standards Authority, investigates complaints of breaches. The policy requires that marketing professionals not mislead their audience, including by omitting a disclosure of their material connection.

In Australia, astroturfing is regulated by Section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law, which broadly prohibits &quot;misleading and deceptive conduct&quot;. According to the &quot;Journal of Consumer Policy&quot;, Australia&#x27;s laws, which were introduced in 1975, are more vague. In most cases, they are enforced through lawsuits from competitors, rather than the regulatory body, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission. There is also an International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN).

Legal regulations are primarily targeted towards testimonials, endorsements and statements as to the performance or quality of a product. Employees of an organization may be considered acting as customers if their actions are not guided by authority within the company.

In October 2018, after denying that they had paid for people to show up in support of a controversial power plant development project in New Orleans, Entergy was fined five million dollars for using astroturf firm The Hawthorn Group to provide actors to prevent real community members&#x27; voices from being counted at city council meetings and show false grassroots support.

==Debate==

===Effectiveness===

In the book &quot;Grassroots for Hire: Public Affairs Consultants in American Democracy,&quot; Edward Walker defines &quot;astroturfing&quot; as public participation that is perceived as heavily incented, as fraudulent (claims are attributed to those who did not make such statements), or as an elite campaign masquerading as a mass movement. Although not all campaigns by professional grassroots lobbying consultants meet this definition, the book finds that the elite-sponsored grassroots campaigns often fail when they are not transparent about their sources of sponsorship and/or fail to develop partnerships with constituencies that have an independent interest in the issue. Walker highlights the case of Working Families for Wal-Mart, in which the campaign&#x27;s lack of transparency led to its demise.

A study published in the &quot;Journal of Business Ethics&quot; examined the effects of websites operated by front groups on students. It found that astroturfing was effective at creating uncertainty and lowering trust about claims, thereby changing perceptions that tend to favor the business interests behind the astroturfing effort. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;consumer&quot; reviews are more effective, because &quot;they purport to be testimonials of real people, even though some are bought and sold just like everything else on the commercial Internet.&quot; Some organizations feel that their business is threatened by negative comments, so they may engage in astroturfing to drown them out. Online comments from astroturfing employees can also sway the discussion through the influence of groupthink.

===Justification===
Some astroturfing operatives defend their practice. Regarding &quot;movements that have organized aggressively to exaggerate their sway&quot;, author Ryan Sager said that this &quot;isn&#x27;t cheating. Doing everything in your power to get your people to show up is basic politics.&quot; According to a Porter/Novelli executive, &quot;There will be times when the position you advocate, no matter how well framed and supported, will not be accepted by the public simply because you are who you are.&quot;

Groups like FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity assert that providing organizational structure and support to grassroots movements is essential for effective advocacy. They argue that the concept of grassroots movements being entirely spontaneous is unrealistic and that some level of organization is necessary to amplify voices and mobilize supporters effectively. These groups claim that their activities are legitimate and that they are simply providing the necessary backbone for authentic activism.

===Impact on society===
Data-mining expert Bing Liu (University of Illinois Chicago) estimated that one-third of all consumer reviews on the Internet are fake. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, this has made it hard to tell the difference between &quot;popular sentiment&quot; and &quot;manufactured public opinion&quot;. According to an article in the &quot;Journal of Business Ethics&quot;, astroturfing threatens the legitimacy of genuine grassroots movements. The authors argued that astroturfing that is &quot;purposefully designed to fulfill corporate agendas, manipulate public opinion and harm scientific research represents a serious lapse in ethical conduct.&quot; A 2011 report found that often paid posters from competing companies are attacking each other in forums and overwhelming regular participants in the process. George Monbiot said that persona-management software supporting astroturfing &quot;could destroy the Internet as a forum for constructive debate&quot;. An article in the &quot;Journal of Consumer Policy&quot; said that regulators and policy makers needed to be more aggressive about astroturfing. The author said that it undermines the public&#x27;s ability to inform potential customers of sub-standard products or inappropriate business practices, but also noted that fake reviews were difficult to detect.
==Techniques==
Use of one or more front groups is one astroturfing technique. These groups typically present themselves as serving the public interest, while actually working on behalf of a corporate or political sponsor. Front groups may resist legislation and scientific consensus that is damaging to the sponsor&#x27;s business by emphasizing minority viewpoints, instilling doubt and publishing counterclaims by corporate-sponsored experts. Fake blogs can also be created that appear to be written by consumers, while actually being operated by a commercial or political interest. Some political movements have provided incentives for members of the public to send a letter to the editor at their local paper, often using a copy and paste form letter that is published in dozens of newspapers verbatim. Mass letters may be printed on personalized stationery using different typefaces, colors and words to make them appear personal.

Another technique is the use of sockpuppets, where a single person creates multiple identities online to give the appearance of grassroots support. Sockpuppets may post positive reviews about a product, attack participants that criticize the organization, or post negative reviews and comments about competitors, under fake identities. Astroturfing businesses may pay staff based on the number of posts they make that are not flagged by moderators. Persona management software may be used so that each paid poster can manage five to seventy convincing online personas without getting them confused. Online astroturfing using sockpuppets is a form of Sybil attack against distributed systems.

Pharmaceutical companies may sponsor patient support groups and simultaneously push them to help market their products. Bloggers who receive free products, paid travel or other accommodations may also be considered astroturfing if those gifts are not disclosed to the reader. Analysts could be considered astroturfing, since they often cover their own clients without disclosing their financial connection. To avoid astroturfing, many organizations and press have policies about gifts, accommodations and disclosures.

Persona management software can age accounts and simulate the activity of attending a conference automatically to make it more convincing that they are genuine. At HBGary, employees were given separate thumb drives that contain online accounts for individual identities and visual cues to remind the employee which identity they are using at the time.

===Detection===

According to an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the Federal Trade Commission rarely enforces its astroturfing laws. Operations are frequently detected if their profile images are recognized or if they are identified through the usage patterns of their accounts. Filippo Menczer&#x27;s group at Indiana University developed software in 2010 that detects astroturfing on Twitter by recognizing behavioral patterns. Researchers are exploring other techniques of detecting astroturfing including machine learning, linguistic analysis, and content analysis.

==Business and adoption==
According to an article in the &quot;Journal of Consumer Policy&quot;, academics disagree on how prolific astroturfing is.

According to Nancy Clark from Precision Communications, grass-roots specialists charge $25 to $75 for each constituent they convince to send a letter to a politician. Paid online commentators in China are purportedly paid 50 cents for each online post that is not removed by moderators, leading to the nickname of the &quot;50-cent party&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that a business selling fake online book reviews charged $999 for 50 reviews and made $28,000 a month shortly after opening.

According to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, astroturfing is &quot;commonplace&quot; in American politics, but was &quot;revolutionary&quot; in Europe when it was exposed that the European Privacy Association, an anti-privacy &quot;think-tank&quot;, was actually sponsored by technology companies.

==History of incidents==

===Origins===
Although the term &quot;astroturfing&quot; was not yet developed, an early example of the practice was in Act 1, Scene 2 of Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. In the play, Gaius Cassius Longinus writes fake letters from &quot;the public&quot; to convince Brutus to assassinate Julius Caesar.

The term &quot;astroturfing&quot; was first coined in 1985 by Texas Democratic Party senator Lloyd Bentsen when he said, &quot;a fellow from Texas can tell the difference between grass roots and AstroTurf... this is generated mail.&quot; Bentsen was describing a &quot;mountain of cards and letters&quot; sent to his office to promote insurance industry interests.

===Pharmaceuticals===
Patient advocacy groups funded by biopharmaceutical companies are common. In 1997, Schering Plough paid a P/R firm Schandwick International, to create a national coalition of patient advocacy groups promoting Schering&#x27;s Rebotron, a treatment for Hepatitis C. The groups pushed increased testing as a way to manufacture cases and lobbied state legislatures to cover the $18,000 treatment. The groups also hosted telephone &quot;information lines&quot; with scripts written by the drug company and distributed &quot;patient information&quot; pamphlets promoting drug therapies over other alternatives and overstating the danger of the medical condition. Manufacturers of AIDS drugs commonly fund LGBTQ organizations, which in turn, lobby to advance policies that increase AIDS drug sales. In 2019, the communications director of AIDS United, a Washington DC–based coalition of AIDS service organizations, resigned, stating such funding creates conflicts of interest among gay rights activists.

===Tobacco===
In response to the passage of tobacco control legislation in the US, Philip Morris, Burson-Marsteller and other tobacco interests created the National Smokers Alliance (NSA) in 1993. The NSA and other tobacco interests initiated an aggressive public relations campaign from 1994 to 1999 in an effort to exaggerate the appearance of grassroots support for smoker&#x27;s rights. According to an article in the &quot;Journal of Health Communication&quot;, the NSA had mixed success at defeating bills that were damaging revenues of tobacco interests.

===Internet===
Email, automated phone calls, form letters, and the Internet made astroturfing more economical and prolific in the late 1990s. The internet in particular has made astroturfing cheaper, more widespread, and harder to detect.

In 2001, as Microsoft was defending itself against an antitrust lawsuit, Americans for Technology Leadership (ATL), a group heavily funded by Microsoft, initiated a letter-writing campaign. ATL contacted constituents under the guise of conducting a poll and sent pro-Microsoft consumers form and sample letters to send to involved lawmakers. The effort was designed to make it appear as though there was public support for a sympathetic ruling in the antitrust lawsuit.

In January 2018, YouTube user Isaac Protiva uploaded a video alleging that internet service provider Fidelity Communications was behind an initiative called &quot;Stop City-Funded Internet&quot;, based on how some images on the Stop City-Funded Internet website had &quot;Fidelity&quot; in their file names. The campaign appeared to be in response to the city of West Plains expanding their broadband network, and advocated for the end of municipal broadband on the basis that it was too risky. Days later, Fidelity released a letter admitting to sponsoring the campaign.

===Politics===

In 2009–2010, an Indiana University research study developed a software system to detect astroturfing on Twitter due to the sensitivity of the topic in the run up to the 2010 U.S. midterm elections and account suspensions on the social media platform. The study cited a limited number of examples, all promoting conservative policies and candidates.

In 2003, GOPTeamLeader.com offered the site&#x27;s users &quot;points&quot; that could be redeemed for products if they signed a form letter promoting George Bush and got a local paper to publish it as a letter to the editor. More than 100 newspapers published an identical letter to the editor from the site with different signatures on it. Similar campaigns were used by GeorgeWBush.com, and by MoveOn.org to promote Michael Moore&#x27;s film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget&#x27;s &quot;Fix the Debt&quot; campaign advocated to reduce government debt without disclosing that its members were lobbyists or high-ranking employees at corporations that aim to reduce federal spending. It also sent op-eds to various students that were published as-is.

Some organizations in the Tea Party movement have been accused of being astroturfed.

In October and November 2018, conservative marketing firm Rally Forge created what &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described as &quot;a phony left-wing front group, America Progress Now, which promoted Green Party candidates online in 2018, apparently to hurt Democrats in several races.&quot; Its ads on Facebook used socialist memes and slogans to attack Democrats and urge third-party protest voting in several tight races, including the 2018 Wisconsin gubernatorial election.

In 2018, a website called &quot;Jexodus&quot; claiming to be by &quot;proud Jewish Millennials tired of living in bondage to leftist politics&quot; was set up by Jeff Ballabon, a Republican operative in his mid-50s. The website was denounced as &quot;likely a clumsy astroturf effort rather than an actual grassroots movement&quot;. The website was registered November 5, 2018, before the congressional election, and before those representatives accused of antisemitism had even been voted in. This website was later cited by Donald Trump as though it were an authentic movement.

In January 2021, a team led by Mohsen Mosleh conducted a politically oriented astroturfing campaign on Twitter, using &quot;a set of human-looking bot accounts&quot;; each bot would search for users posting links the researchers considered to be fake news, and &quot;tweet a public reply message to the user&#x27;s tweet that contained the link to the false story&quot;. 1,586 spam replies were made over the course of fourteen days, until Twitter detected and suspended all of the bot accounts.

===Environment===
The Koch brothers started a public advocacy group to prevent the development of wind turbines offshore in Massachusetts. The Kennedy family was also involved.

Corporate efforts to mobilize the public against environmental regulation accelerated in the US following the election of president Barack Obama.

In 2014, the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; conservative media organization has published an article accusing Russia of using astroturf tactics to drum up anti-fracking sentiment across Europe and the West, supposedly in order to maintain dominance in oil exports through Ukraine.

In Canada, a coalition of oil and gas company executives grouped under the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers also initiated a series of Canadian actions to advocate for the oil and gas industry in Canada through mainstream and social media, and using online campaigning to generate public support for fossil fuel energy projects.

===Commercial===
In 2006, two Edelman employees created a blog called &quot;Wal-Marting Across America&quot; about two people traveling to Wal-Marts across the country. The blog gave the appearance of being operated by spontaneous consumers, but was actually operated on behalf of Working Families for Walmart, a group funded by Wal-Mart. In 2007, Ask.com deployed an anti-Google advertising campaign portraying Google as an &quot;information monopoly&quot; that was damaging the Internet. The ad was designed to give the appearance of a popular movement and did not disclose it was funded by a competitor.

In 2010, the Federal Trade Commission settled a complaint with Reverb Communications, who was using interns to post favorable product reviews in Apple&#x27;s iTunes store for clients. In September 2012, one of the first major identified cases of astroturfing in Finland involved criticisms about the cost of a €1.8 billion patient information system, which was defended by fake online identities operated by involved vendors.

In September 2013, New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman announced a settlement with 19 companies to prevent astroturfing. &quot;&#x27;Astroturfing&#x27; is the 21st century&#x27;s version of false advertising, and prosecutors have many tools at their disposal to put an end to it,&quot; said Scheiderman. The companies paid $350,000 to settle the matter, but the settlement opened the way for private suits as well. &quot;Every state has some version of the statutes New York used,&quot; according to lawyer Kelly H. Kolb. &quot;What the New York attorney general has done is, perhaps, to have given private lawyers a road map to file suit.&quot;

===State-sponsored===

An Al Jazeera TV series &quot;The Lobby&quot; documented Israel&#x27;s attempt to promote more friendly, pro-Israel rhetoric to influence the attitudes of British youth, partly through influencing already established political bodies, such as the National Union of Students and the Labour Party, but also by creating new pro-Israel groups whose affiliation with the Israeli administration was kept secret.

In 2008, an expert on Chinese affairs, Rebecca MacKinnon, estimated the Chinese government employed 280,000 people in a government-sponsored astroturfing operation to post pro-government propaganda on social media and drown out voices of dissent.

In June 2010, the United States Air Force solicited for &quot;persona management&quot; software that would &quot;enable an operator to exercise a number of different online persons from the same workstation and without fear of being discovered by sophisticated adversaries. Personas must be able to appear to originate in nearly any part of the world and can interact through conventional online services and social media platforms...&quot; The $2.6 million contract was awarded to Ntrepid for astroturfing software the military would use to spread pro-American propaganda in the Middle East, and disrupt extremist propaganda and recruitment. The contract is thought to have been awarded as part of a program called Operation Earnest Voice, which was first developed as a psychological warfare weapon against the online presence of groups ranged against coalition forces.

In August 2020, the US-based public relations firm, CLS Strategies, was linked to a network of accounts removed by Facebook due to violations of their policies in regards to foreign interference. 55 Facebook accounts, 42 pages, and 36 Instagram accounts were removed. The information Facebook shared with investigators showed that the accounts focused on Venezuela, Bolivia, and Mexico, and included duplicate and fake accounts. Records showed connections with CLS Strategies employees, and that some of the work appeared to be at the behest of the Bolivian Government. Facebook had announced the closure of the accounts, stating that they targeted politics in the region and that $3.6 million was spent on advertising in the three countries on what they determined to be disinformation. CLS Strategies claimed the accusations made by Facebook were inaccurate.

On April 11, 2022, seven weeks into the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, BBC published the results of investigation of a network of Facebook groups with the overall aim to promote the Russian president Vladimir Putin as a hero standing up to the West with overwhelming international support. Members, activities, and interrelations in 10 pro-Putin public groups with more than 650,000 members between them in the time of writing, boasting names such as &quot;Vladimir Putin - Leader of the Free World&quot;, were analyzed. Over a month, researchers counted 16,500 posts, receiving more than 3.6 million interactions. The campaign &quot;creates the appearance of widespread support for Putin and the Kremlin in the shadow of the invasion and relies on... inauthentic accounts to accomplish its goal&quot;, according to a report. Lead researcher Moustafa Ayad described the network and its practice of using tens of duplicate accounts in potential violation of Facebook&#x27;s rules on inauthentic behavior as an example of &quot;astroturfing&quot;.

<text>OmniWeb is a discontinued web browser developed and marketed by The Omni Group exclusively for Apple&#x27;s macOS operating system. Though a stable version is no longer maintained, it is still available as a free download, and unstable versions are still being released.

==History==
OmniWeb was originally developed by Omni Group for the NeXTSTEP platform and was released by Lighthouse Design on March 17, 1995, after only one month&#x27;s development. As NeXTSTEP evolved into OPENSTEP and then Mac OS X, OmniWeb was updated to run on these platforms. These early versions of OmniWeb also run on Microsoft Windows through the Yellow Box or the OpenStep frameworks. After Sun Microsystems bought Lighthouse Design, the Omni Group released the product from version 2.5 onwards. From version 4.0 onwards, OmniWeb was developed solely for the OS X platform.

OmniWeb was developed using the Cocoa API, which allows it to take full advantage of OS X features. It uses Quartz to render images and smooth text. It uses multiple processors, if available, and features an interface that uses Aqua UI features such as drawers, sheets, and customizable toolbars.

The Omni Group originally employed its proprietary HTML layout engine that uses standard API NSText components. However, this engine was very slow, particularly when scrolling, and was not fully compatible with the most recent web standards, such as Cascading Style Sheets. In OmniWeb version 4.5, the Omni Group adopted Apple&#x27;s KHTML-based WebCore rendering engine, which was created by Apple for its Safari browser.

On August 11, 2004, the Omni Group released version 5.0 of OmniWeb, which added several new features. The most notable addition was an unusual implementation of tabbed browsing, in which the tabs are displayed vertically in a drawer on the side of the window (including optional thumbnail pictures of the pages.) Despite controversy over the merits of a tab drawer over a tab toolbar, the feature persists through the final version.

On September 7, 2006, version 5.5 was released. Major new features include the use of a custom version of WebKit instead of WebCore, universal binary support, saving to the web archive, support for user-defined style sheets, a &quot;Select Next Link&quot; feature, FTP folder display, ad-blocking improvements, updated localizations, and many other small changes and bug fixes.

OmniWeb was Omni Group&#x27;s flagship app, but as OS X web browsers improved—Apple eventually bundled Safari into OS X— and Omni successfully introduced other products such as OmniGraffle and OmniOutliner, OmniWeb&#x27;s importance diminished. OmniWeb&#x27;s price was successively lowered, first to $39.95, then on February 24, 2009, Omni Group announced that OmniWeb would be made available for free, a change from its previous price of $14.95. The Omni Group official website now states that the browser is no longer under active development.

==Features==
* Separate window form editing: Click the square in the upper right corner of multi line form fields to open it in a separate window. This helped when adding much text to a small area and wanting to see all of it at once. This feature also allowed you to enter tab characters.
* Workspaces: groups of web browser windows and tabs in them. A user can have multiple workspaces for different web research topics and quickly switch between them with a key shortcut or menu choice
* View Links: By clicking on this button in the toolbar, one can quickly view all the links contained in the page.
* Ad blocking: OmniWeb uses a powerful pattern match ad blocking feature to stop images from loading from servers matching the pattern. It is also possible to block images that didn&#x27;t originate from the current server and to block images that match common advertisement sizes.
* Shortcuts: allows one to type a key word or phrase to open a certain web site or begin a specific web search.
* Site-specific preferences: OmniWeb allows you to specify preferences that apply to specific websites. For example, if you adjust the font size on a given web page, the adjusted font size is used on all other pages of the same site. Preferences are saved automatically and retained between browsing sessions.

== Reception ==
OmniWeb was popular in the early 2000s when OmniGroup&#x27;s experience developing for OpenStep (which became the foundation for Mac OS X) gave them an edge over other developers. Until Apple&#x27;s Safari, the Omni Group had the best support for Mac OS X technologies among its competition (chiefly Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer for Mac). John Siracusa, a technology journalist and critic writing for &quot;Ars Technica&quot;, said, &quot;Finding [this level of functionality] in a proper Mac OS X application from a respected developer with a proven track record is like finding a perfect 1/10,000th scale replica of the Eiffel Tower in a box of crackerjacks. Then the tower transforms into a tiny robot and makes you lunch.&quot;

<doc id="241414" wikidata="Q61497" url="?curid=241414" title="Kurt Tank">
<text>Kurt Waldemar Tank (24 February 1898 – 5 June 1983) was a German aeronautical engineer and test pilot who led the design department at Focke-Wulf from 1931 to 1945. He was responsible for the creation of several important Luftwaffe aircraft of World War II, including the Fw 190 fighter aircraft, the Ta 152 fighter-interceptor and the Fw 200 Condor airliner. After the war, Tank spent two decades designing aircraft abroad, working first in Argentina and then in India, before returning to West Germany in the late 1960s to work as a consultant for Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB).

==Early life==
Tank was born in Bromberg (Bydgoszcz), Province of Posen in present-day Poland. His grandfather was a cavalry sergeant in the Uhlans and his father, Willi Tank, was a grenadier sergeant in the 3rd Division. When World War I broke out Tank wished to join the &quot;Deutsches Heer&quot;&#x27;s then-named &quot;Fliegertruppe&quot; air service, but his father insisted he instead follow the family tradition and enlist in the cavalry or the infantry. He ended the war as a lieutenant, with decorations (Ehrenkreuz I. und II. Klasse von 1914, Ehrenkreuz Schwarzburg-Sondershausen und Ehrenkreuz für Frontkämpfer).

==Career==
After the war, Tank graduated from the Technische Hochschule Berlin (now Technische Universität Berlin) in 1923. A mentor from the university secured him his first job, in the design department of Rohrbach Metallflugzeug GmbH, where he worked on flying boats, and helped design a passenger aircraft, the Ro VIII &quot;Roland&quot;.

Tank moved to the firm Albatros Flugzeugwerke, where he worked as a test pilot. The Albatros company went bankrupt in 1929 and in 1931, under government pressure, was merged with Focke-Wulf.

Tank then started work on the design of the Fw 44 &quot;Stieglitz&quot; (Goldfinch), a two-seat civilian biplane. It was Focke-Wulf&#x27;s first commercially successful design, launched in 1932. In 1934 Tank&#x27;s Fw 56 advanced trainer began production. This led to burgeoning growth for the company as Hitler began to prepare the country for war.

Ludwig Roselius, chairman and 46% majority shareholder of Focke-Wulf via Kaffee HAG, and Barbara Goette - his closest confidante - met with Tank in the Marcus-Allee, Bremen on many occasions. Barbara declared Focke-Wulf to be a &quot;war-determining&quot; enterprise.

In 1936 Tank designed the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 &quot;Condor&quot; to a Deutsche Luft Hansa specification for air transport. The first flight, with Tank as pilot, occurred in July 1937, less than a year after work had begun. The &quot;Condor&quot; made a famous non-stop flight from Berlin to New York City in 1938, proving the concept of transatlantic air travel. The &quot;Condor&quot; would later be used as a maritime patrol bomber aircraft of some repute during the war.

===World War II===

The Fw 190 &quot;Würger&quot; (Shrike), first flying in 1939 and produced from 1941 to 1945, was a mainstay Luftwaffe single-seat fighter during World War II, and Tank&#x27;s most-produced (over 20,000) and famous design. In January 1943, he was named honorary professor with a chair at the Technische Hochschule Braunschweig, in recognition of his work developing aircraft.

In 1944, the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (German Air Ministry) decided that new fighter aircraft designations must include the chief designer&#x27;s name. Kurt Tank&#x27;s new designs were therefore given the prefix Ta. His most notable late-war design was the high-speed/high-altitude Ta 152 single-engine fighter, a continuation of the Fw 190 design.

===Postwar===
After the war, Tank negotiated for an employment position with the United Kingdom, with the Nationalist government of China, and with representatives of the Soviet Union. The British government decided not to offer him a contract on the grounds that they could not see how he could be integrated into a research project or design group.

When those negotiations proved unsuccessful, he accepted an offer from Argentina to work at its aerotechnical institute, the Instituto Aerotécnico in Córdoba under the name of Pedro Matthies. 

Tank moved to Córdoba in central Argentina in late 1946, with many of his Focke-Wulf co-workers. He also reportedly recommended Ronald Richter, who proposed to power airplanes with nuclear energy, to the Argentine officials. Richter would later be involved in the Huemul Project, which was eventually proven to be a fraud.
The Instituto Aerotécnico later became Argentina&#x27;s military aeroplane factory, the Fábrica Militar de Aviones. While there, Tank designed the IAe Pulqui II based on the Focke-Wulf Ta 183 design that had reached mock-up stage by the end of World War II; it was a state-of-the-art design for its day, but the project was cancelled after the fall of Peron in 1955. When President Juan Perón fell from power, the ex-Focke-Wulf team dispersed, with many, including Tank, moving to India. First he worked as Director of the Madras Institute of Technology, where one of his students was future President of India Abdul Kalam, who went on to design the indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV) and lead the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme. Tank later joined Hindustan Aeronautics, where he designed the Hindustan Marut fighter-bomber, the first military aircraft constructed in India. The first prototype flew in 1961, and the Marut was retired from active service in 1985. Tank left Hindustan Aeronautics in 1967 and by the 1970s, he had returned to live in West Berlin, basing himself in Germany for the rest of his life. He worked as a consultant for MBB.

== Death ==
He died in Munich in 1983.

<doc id="241420" wikidata="Q622604" url="?curid=241420" title="Pyromania">
<text>Pyromania is an impulse control disorder in which individuals repeatedly fail to resist impulses to deliberately start fires, to relieve some tension or for instant gratification. The term &quot;pyromania&quot; comes from the Greek word (&quot;pyr&quot;, &#x27;fire&#x27;). Pyromania is distinct from arson, the deliberate setting of fires for personal, monetary or political gain. Pyromaniacs start fires to release anxiety and tension, or for arousal. Other impulse disorders include kleptomania and intermittent explosive disorder.

There are specific symptoms that separate pyromaniacs from those who start fires for criminal purposes or due to emotional motivations not specifically related to fire. Someone with this disorder deliberately and purposely sets fires on more than one occasion, and before the act of lighting the fire the person usually experiences tension and an emotional buildup. When around fires, a person with pyromania gains intense interest or fascination and may also experience pleasure, gratification or relief. Another long term contributor often linked with pyromania is the buildup of stress. When studying the lifestyle of someone with pyromania, a buildup of stress and emotion is often evident and this is seen in teens&#x27; attitudes towards friends and family. At times it is difficult to distinguish the difference between pyromania and experimentation in childhood because both involve pleasure from the fire.

==Classification==
===ICD===
The World Health Organization&#x27;s International Classification of Diseases (11th Revision) ICD-11, regarded as the global standard, was released in June 2018 and came into full effect from January 2022. It states the following about pyromania:

It also notes that pyromania has no relation to intellectual impairment, substance abuse, or other mental and behavioral disorder. ICD-11 was produced by professionals from 55 countries out of the 90 countries involved and is one of the most widely used reference worldwide by clinicians, with the other being the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR from 2022, DSM-5 from 2013, or their predecessors).

===DSM===
The American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, First Edition, released in 1952, categorized pyromania as a subset of Obsessive–compulsive disorder. In the Second Edition, the disorder was dropped. In the Third Edition, it returned under the category of impulse-control disorders.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), released in 2022, states that the essential feature of pyromania is &quot;the presence of multiple episodes of deliberate and purposeful fire setting.&quot; Pyromania moved from the DSM-4 chapter &quot;Impulse-Control Disorders Not Otherwise Specified,&quot; to the chapter &quot;Disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders&quot; in DSM-5.

==Causes==
Most studied cases of pyromania occur in children and teenagers. There is a range of causes, but an understanding of the different motives and actions of fire setters can provide a platform for prevention. Common causes of pyromania can be broken down into two main groups: individual and environmental. This includes the complex understanding of factors such as individual temperament, parental psychopathology, and possible neurochemical predispositions. Many studies have shown that patients with pyromania were in households without a father figure present.

=== Environmental ===
Environmental factors that may lead to pyromania include an event that the patient has experienced in the environment they live in. Environmental factors include neglect from parents and physical or emotional abuse in earlier life. Other causes include early experiences of watching adults or teenagers using fire inappropriately and lighting fires as a stress reliever.

==Treatment and prognosis==
The appropriate treatment for pyromania varies with the age of the patient and the seriousness of the condition. For children and adolescents treatment usually is cognitive behavioral therapy sessions in which the patient&#x27;s situation is diagnosed to find out what may have caused this impulsive behavior. Once the situation is diagnosed, repeated therapy sessions usually help continue to a recovery. Other important steps must be taken as well with the interventions and the cause of the impulse behavior. Some other treatments include parenting training, over-correction/satiation/negative practice with corrective consequences, behavior contracting/token reinforcement, special problem-solving skills training, relaxation training, covert sensitization, fire safety and prevention education, individual and family therapy, and medication. The prognosis for recovery in adolescents and children with pyromania depends on the environmental or individual factors in play, but is generally positive. Pyromania is generally harder to treat in adults, often due to lack of cooperation by the patient. Treatment usually consists of more medication to prevent stress or emotional outbursts, in addition to long-term psychotherapy. In adults, however, the recovery rate is generally poor, and if an adult does recover, it usually takes a longer period of time.

==History==
Pyromania was thought in the 1800s to be a concept involved with moral insanity and moral treatment, but had not been categorized under impulse control disorders. Pyromania is one of the four recognized types of arson alongside burning for profit, to cover up an act of crime, and for revenge. Pyromania is the second most common type of arson. Common synonyms for pyromaniacs in colloquial English include firebug (US) and fire raiser (UK), but these also refer to arsonists. Pyromania is a rare disorder with an incidence of less than one percent in most studies; also, pyromaniacs hold a very small proportion of psychiatric hospital admissions. Pyromania can occur in children as young as age three, though such cases are rare. Only a small percentage of children and teenagers arrested for arson are child pyromaniacs. A preponderance of the individuals are male; one source states that ninety percent of those diagnosed with pyromania are male. Based on a survey of 9,282 Americans using the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;, 4th edition, impulse-control problems such as gambling, pyromania and compulsive shopping collectively affect 9% of the population. A 1979 study by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration found that only 14% of fires were started by pyromaniacs and others with mental illness. A 1951 study by Lewis and Yarnell, one of the largest epidemiological studies conducted, found that 39% of those who had intentionally set fires had been diagnosed with pyromania.

<doc id="241425" wikidata="Q193849" url="?curid=241425" title="Avalokiteśvara">
<text>In Buddhism, Avalokiteśvara (meaning &quot;the lord who looks down&quot;, IPA: ), also known as Lokeśvara (&quot;Lord of the World&quot;) and Chenrezig (in Tibetan), is a tenth-level bodhisattva associated with great compassion (&quot;mahakaruṇā&quot;). He is often associated with Amitabha Buddha. Avalokiteśvara has numerous manifestations and is depicted in various forms and styles. In some texts, he is even considered to be the source of all Hindu deities (such as Vishnu, Shiva, Saraswati, Brahma, etc).

While Avalokiteśvara was depicted as male in India, in East Asian Buddhism, Avalokiteśvara is most often depicted as a female figure known as [[Guanyin]], Kannon, Gwaneum, and Quan Âm in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese, respectively. Guanyin is also an important figure in other East Asian religions, particularly Chinese folk religion and Daoism.

Avalokiteśvara is also known for his popular mantra, , which is the most popular mantra in Tibetan Buddhism.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Avalokiteśvara&quot; combines the verbal prefix &quot;ava&quot; &quot;down&quot;, &quot;lokita&quot;, a past participle of the verb &quot;lok&quot; &quot;to look, notice, behold, observe&quot;, here used in an active sense, and finally &quot;īśvara&quot;, &quot;lord&quot;, &quot;ruler&quot;, &quot;sovereign&quot;, or &quot;master&quot;. In accordance with sandhi (Sanskrit rules of sound combination), &quot;a&quot;+&quot;īśvara&quot; becomes &quot;eśvara&quot;. Combined, the parts mean &quot;lord who gazed down (at the world)&quot;. The word &quot;loka&quot; (&quot;world&quot;) is absent from the name, but the phrase is implied. It does appear in the Cambodian form of the name, &quot;Lokesvarak&quot;.

The earliest translation of the name &quot;Avalokiteśvara&quot; into Chinese by authors such as Xuanzang was as &quot;Guānzìzài&quot; (), not the form used in East Asian Buddhism today, which is Guanyin (). It was initially thought that this was due to a lack of fluency, as &quot;Guanyin&quot; indicates the original Sanskrit form was instead &quot;Avalokitasvara&quot;, &quot;who looked down upon sound&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the cries of sentient beings who need help. It is now understood that &quot;Avalokitasvara&quot; was the original form and is also the origin of &quot;Guanyin&quot; &quot;perceiving sound, cries&quot;. This translation was favored by the tendency of some Chinese translators, notably Kumārajīva, to use the variant &quot;Guānshìyīn&quot; &quot;who perceives the world&#x27;s lamentations&quot;—wherein &quot;lok&quot; was read as simultaneously meaning both &quot;to look&quot; and &quot;world&quot; (Sanskrit &quot;loka&quot;; ). The original form of Guanyin&#x27;s name appears in Sanskrit fragments from the fifth century.
The original meaning of the name fits the Buddhist understanding of the role of a bodhisattva. The reinterpretation presenting him as an &quot;īśvara&quot; shows a strong influence of Hinduism, as the term &quot;īśvara&quot; was usually connected to the Hindu notion of Vishnu (in Vaishnavism) or Shiva (in Shaivism) as the Supreme Lord, Creator, and Ruler of the world. Some attributes of such a god were transmitted to the bodhisattva, but the mainstream of those who venerated Avalokiteśvara upheld the Buddhist rejection of the doctrine of any creator god.

In Sanskrit, Avalokiteśvara is also referred to as &quot;Lokeśvara&quot; (&quot;Lord of the World&quot;). In Tibetan, Avalokiteśvara is &quot;Chenrézig&quot; (). The etymology of the Tibetan name Chenrézik is &quot;spyan&quot; &quot;eye&quot;, &quot;ras&quot; &quot;continuity&quot;, and &quot;gzig&quot; &quot;to look&quot;. This gives the meaning of one who always looks upon all beings (with the eye of compassion).

==Origin==

===Mahayana account===
The name Avalokiteśvara first appeared in the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;, a Mahayana scripture that precedes the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;. On account of its popularity in Japan and as a result of the works of the earliest Western translators of Buddhist Scriptures, the Lotus Sutra, however, has long been accepted as the earliest literature teaching about the doctrines of Avalokiteśvara. These are found in Chapter 25 of the &quot;Lotus Sutra:&quot; The Universal Gate of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara (). This chapter is devoted to Avalokiteśvara, describing him as a compassionate bodhisattva who hears the cries of sentient beings and who works tirelessly to help those who call upon his name. A total of 33 different manifestations of Avalokiteśvara are described, including female manifestations, all to suit the minds of various beings. The chapter consists of both a prose and a verse section. This earliest source often circulates separately as its own sutra, called the &quot;Avalokiteśvara Sūtra&quot; (), and is commonly recited or chanted at Buddhist temples in East Asia.

When the Chinese monk Faxian traveled to Mathura in India around 400 CE, he wrote about monks presenting offerings to Avalokiteśvara. When Xuanzang traveled to India in the 7th century, he provided eyewitness accounts of Avalokiteśvara statues being venerated by devotees from all walks of life, from kings to monks to laypeople.

In Chinese Buddhism and East Asia, Tangmi practices for the 18-armed form of Avalokiteśvara called Cundī are very popular. The popularity of Cundī is attested by the three extant translations of the &quot;Cundī Dhāraṇī Sūtra&quot; from Sanskrit to Chinese, made from the end of the seventh century to the beginning of the eighth century. In late imperial China, these early esoteric traditions still thrived in Buddhist communities. Robert Gimello has also observed that in these communities, the esoteric practices of Cundī were extremely popular among both the populace and the elite.

In the Tiantai school, six forms of Avalokiteśvara are defined. Each of the bodhisattva&#x27;s six qualities is said to break the hindrances in one of the six realms of existence: hell-beings, pretas, animals, humans, asuras, and devas.

According to the prologue of Nīlakaṇṭha Dhāraṇī Sūtra, Gautama Buddha told his disciple Ānanda that Avalokiteśvara had become a Buddha from countless previous incarnations ago, alias Samyaka Dharma-vidya Tathāgata means &quot;Tathāgata who clearly understood the right Dharma&quot;. Because of his great compassion and because he wanted to create proper conditions for all the Bodhisattva ranks and bring happiness and peacefulness to sentient beings, he became a Bodhisattva, taking the name of Avalokiteshvara and often abiding in the Sahā world. At the same time, Avalokiteśvara is also the attendant of Amitabha Buddha, assisting Amitabha Buddha to teach the Dharma in his Pure Land.

===Theravāda account===

Veneration of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva has continued to the present day in Sri Lanka.

In times past, both &quot;Tantrayana&quot; and &quot;Mahayana&quot; have been found in some of the &quot;Theravada&quot; countries, but today the Buddhism of Sri Lanka (formerly, Ceylon), Myanmar (formerly, Burma), Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia is almost exclusively &quot;Theravada&quot;, based on the Pali Canon. The only &quot;Mahayana&quot; deity that has entered the worship of ordinary Buddhists in Theravada Buddhism is &quot;Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara&quot;. In Sri Lanka, he is known as &quot;Natha-deva&quot; and is mistaken by the majority for the Buddha yet to come, &quot;Bodhisattva Maitreya&quot;. The figure of &quot;Avalokitesvara&quot; is usually found in the shrine room near the Buddha image.

In more recent times, some western-educated Theravādins have attempted to identify Nātha with Maitreya Bodhisattva; however, traditions and basic iconography (including an image of Amitābha Buddha on the front of the crown) identify Nātha as Avalokiteśvara. Andrew Skilton writes:

Avalokiteśvara is popularly worshipped in Myanmar, where he is called &quot;Lokanat&quot; or lokabyuharnat, and Thailand, where he is called &quot;Lokesvara&quot;. The bodhisattva goes by many other names. In Indochina and Thailand, he is &quot;Lokesvara&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the World&quot;. In Tibet, he is &quot;Chenrezig&quot;, also spelled Spyan-ras gzigs, &quot;With a Pitying Look&quot;. In China, the bodhisattva takes a female form and is called &quot;Guanyin&quot; (also spelled Kwan Yin, Kuanyin, or Kwun Yum), &quot;Hearing the Sounds of the World&quot;. In Japan, Guanyin is &quot;Kannon&quot; or Kanzeon; in Korea, &quot;Gwaneum&quot;; and in Vietnam, &quot;Quan Am&quot;.

===Modern scholarship===
Avalokiteśvara is worshipped as Nātha in Sri Lanka. The Tamil Buddhist tradition developed in Chola literature, such as Buddamitra&#x27;s &quot;Virasoliyam&quot;, states that the Vedic sage Agastya learned Tamil from Avalokiteśvara. The earlier Chinese traveler Xuanzang recorded a temple dedicated to Avalokitesvara in the south Indian Mount Potalaka, a Sanskritization of Pothigai, where Tamil Hindu tradition places Agastya as having learned the Tamil language from Shiva. Avalokitesvara worship gained popularity with the growth of the Abhayagiri vihāra&#x27;s Tamraparniyan Mahayana sect.

Western scholars have not reached a consensus on the origin of the reverence for Avalokiteśvara. Some have suggested that Avalokiteśvara, along with many other supernatural beings in Buddhism, was a borrowing or absorption by Mahayana Buddhism of one or more deities from Hinduism, in particular Shiva or Vishnu. This seems to be based on the name Avalokiteśvara.

On the basis of the study of Buddhist scriptures and ancient Tamil literary sources as well as a field survey, Japanese scholar Shu Hikosaka proposes the hypothesis that ancient Mount Potalaka, the residence of Avalokiteśvara described in the &quot;Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra&quot; and Xuanzang&#x27;s &quot;Great Tang Records on the Western Regions&quot;, is Mount Potigai in Ambasamudram, Tirunelveli, at the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border. Shu also said that Mount Potalaka has been a sacred place for the people of South India since time immemorial. It is the traditional residence of Siddhar Agastya at Agastya Mala. With the spread of Buddhism in the region beginning at the time of the great king Aśoka in the third century BCE, it became a holy place also for Buddhists, who gradually became dominant as a number of their hermits settled there. The local people, though, mainly remained followers of the Tamil animist religion. The mixed Tamil-Buddhist cult culminated in the formation of the figure of Avalokiteśvara.

The name Lokeśvara should not be confused with that of Lokeśvararāja, the Buddha under whom Dharmakara became a monk and made forty-eight vows before becoming Amitābha.

Avalokiteśvara&#x27;s six armed manifestation as Cintāmaṇicakra is also widely venerated in East Asia. The &quot;Cintāmaṇicakra Dharani&quot; () is another popular dharani associated with the bodhisattva.

==Mantras and Dharanis==

There are various mantras and dharanis associated with Avalokiteśvara.

=== Mani mantra ===
In Tibetan Buddhism, the central mantra is the six-syllable mantra (, also called the Mani mantra. Due to his association with this mantra, one form of Avalokiteśvara is called &quot;Ṣaḍākṣarī&quot; (&quot;Lord of the Six Syllables&quot;) in Sanskrit. The Mani mantra is also popular in East Asian Mahayana. There are also different variations of the mani mantra, the most common which is &quot;oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ hrīḥ.&quot; Hrīḥ is the seed syllable of the Lotus Buddha family and the Buddha Amitabha.

Recitation of this mantra while using prayer beads is the most popular religious practice in Tibetan Buddhism. Another popular religious practice associated with om mani padme hum is the spinning of prayer wheels clockwise, which contains numerous repetitions of this mantra and effectively benefits everyone within the vicinity of the practitioner.

The connection between this famous mantra and Avalokiteśvara is documented for the first time in the &quot;&quot;. This text is dated to around the late 4th century CE to the early 5th century CE. In this sūtra, a bodhisattva is told by the Buddha that recitation of this mantra while focusing on the sound can lead to the attainment of eight hundred samādhis.

=== Ārolik mantra ===

Another mantra for Avalokiteśvara commonly recited in East Asian Buddhism is &quot;three and a half syllables&quot; (ardhacaturthākṣara) heart-mantra: &quot;oṃ ārolik svāha&quot; (or sometimes just &quot;Ārolik&quot; or &quot;oṁ ārolik&quot;), which is found (in many forms and variations like &quot;ārolika&quot;, &quot;arulika&quot;, etc.) in numerous pre-tenth-century Indian texts, including the 7th century Chinese translation of the &quot;Dhāraṇīsaṁgraha&quot;, the &quot;Susiddhikarasūtra,&quot; the &quot;Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa&quot;&quot;,&quot; and the &quot;Guhyasamājatantra.&quot;

This is also the main mantra for the bodhisattva in Shingon Buddhism and is considered to be the main mantra of the Lotus Buddha family.

One text (Taisho Tripitaka no. 1031) describes a visualization practice done after reciting oṁ ārolik svāhā seven times which includes meditating on the meanings of the four letters of ārolik which are:

# a: all dharmas are originally unborn (ādyanutpanna); 
# ra: all dharmas are dissociated from defilement (rajas); 
# la: characteristics (lakṣaṇa) are inapprehensible in all dharmas;
# ka: all dharmas are without action (kārya).

The Ārolik mantra has also been found engraved on a few sculptures found in north India&quot;.&quot; One of these begins with &quot;ārolik oṁ hrīḥ&quot;. Another one of these found in Bihar also included other mantras, including &quot;ye dharma hetu&quot;&quot;,&quot; followed by &quot;&quot;namo ratnatrayāya namo Āryāvalokiteśvarāya bodhisatvāya mahāsatvāya mahākāruṇikāya Ārolok Oṁ hriḥ hriḥ&quot;.&quot;

Another longer mantra appears in a translation by Amoghavajra (T. 1033, 20: 9b1–7): namoratnatrayāya | nama āryāvalokiteśvarāya bodhisattvāya mahāsattvāya mahākāruṇikāya | tadyathā

padmapāṇi sara sara ehy ehi bhagavann āryāvalokiteśvara ārolik | In Chinese, &quot;oṃ ārolik svāha&quot; is pronounced &quot;Ǎn ālǔlēi jì suōpóhē&quot; (唵 阿嚕勒繼 娑婆訶). In Korean, it is pronounced &quot;Om aroreuk Ge Sabaha&quot; (옴 아로늑계 사바하). In Japanese, it is pronounced &quot;On arori kya sowa ka&quot; (おん あろりきゃ そわか).

=== Dharanis ===
The &quot;&quot; also features the first appearance of the dhāraṇī of Cundī, which occurs at the end of the sūtra text. After the bodhisattva finally attains samādhi with the mantra &quot;oṃ maṇipadme hūṃ&quot;, he is able to observe 77 koṭīs of fully enlightened buddhas replying to him in one voice with the Cundī Dhāraṇī: 

The &quot;Nīlakaṇṭha Dhāraṇī&quot; is an 82-syllable dhāraṇī for Avalokiteśvara also known as the Great Compassion Mantra. It is very popular in East Asian Buddhism. Another popular Avalokiteśvara dharani in East Asian Buddhism is &quot;Eleven-Faced Avalokitesvara Heart Dharani.&quot; This dharani is associated with Avalokiteśvara&#x27;s eleven face form, known as Ekādaśamukha, one of the six forms of Guanyin.

=== East Asian chants and phrases ===
In East Asian Buddhism, the most popular form of Avalokiteśvara is the feminine white robed Guanyin. A common phrase which is widely chanted and recited by East Asian Buddhists is:Chinese: 南無觀世音菩薩&quot;,&quot; Pinyin: &quot;Námó Guānshìyīn Púsà&quot; (Japanese: &quot;Namu Kanzeon Bosatsu&quot;)In English: &quot;Homage to Guanyin Bodhisattva.&quot; There are also longer chants, usually termed &quot;White Robed Guanyin&quot; (Baiyin Guanyin) sutras (jing) or mantras (zhou). The most well known is the &quot;Divine White-robed Guanyin Mantra&quot; (c. 11th century). This longer mantra is as follows:南無 大慈 大悲 救苦 救難 廣大 靈感 觀世音 菩薩 (Námó dàcí dàbēi jiùkǔ jiùnàn guǎngdà línggǎn Guānshìyīn púsà)

南無 摩訶 般若波羅蜜 (Námó Móhē Bōrěbōluómi)

In Japanese Buddhism, a popular longer chant to Kannon or Kanzeon (Guanyin) is the &quot;jikku kan&#x27;on gyō&quot; (十句觀音經), the &quot;10 Verse Kannon Sutra&quot;. It is the following:觀世音 (&quot;kan ze on&quot;)

念念不離心 (&quot;nen nen fu ri shin&quot;): thought after thought is not separate from mind.
==Manifestations==


Avalokiteśvara has an extraordinarily large number of forms, emanations or manifestations, including wisdom goddesses (&quot;vidyās&quot;) directly associated with him in images and texts.

Furthermore, at least two separate female Buddhist deities, Cundī and Tara also later came to be associated with Avalokiteśvara (and were even seen as manifestations of him).

Some of the more commonly mentioned forms include:

===Thousand-armed Avalokiteśvara===
One prominent Buddhist story tells of Avalokiteśvara vowing never to rest until he had freed all sentient beings from saṃsāra. Despite strenuous effort, he realizes that many unhappy beings were yet to be saved. After struggling to comprehend the needs of so many, his head splits into eleven pieces. Amitābha, seeing his plight, gives him eleven heads with which to hear the cries of the suffering. Upon hearing these cries and comprehending them, Avalokiteśvara tries to reach out to all those who needed aid, but found that his two arms shattered into pieces. Once more, Amitābha comes to his aid and invests him with a thousand arms with which to aid the suffering multitudes.

=== Avalokiteśvara as a cosmic maheśvara (&quot;great lord&quot;) ===
According to various Mahayana sources, numerous Hindu deities are considered to be emanations of Avalokiteshvara. For example, in the &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra&quot;, Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma and Saraswati are all said to have emerged from Avalokiteshvara. The passage states:

Āditya and Candra came from his eyes, Maheśvara came from his forehead, Brahmā came from his shoulders, Nārāyaṇa came from his heart, Devi Sarasvatī came from his canines, Vāyu came from his mouth, Dharaṇī came from his feet, and Varuṇa came from his stomach.

In a similar manner, Hindu deities like Nīlakaṇṭha and Harihara are cited in the &quot;Nīlakaṇṭha Dhāraṇī&quot;, possibly as forms of Avalokiteshvara or as associated bodhisattvas (the text is not clear, though traditionally these have been interpreted as various names or forms of Avalokiteshvara).

Alexander Studholme writes that these sources are influenced by Puranic Hinduism, and its concepts of an Īśvara (&quot;lord&quot;) and Maheśvara (&quot;great lord&quot;), both of which are terms that refer to a transcendent and all pervasive being. The name Maheśvara is also applied to Avalokiteshvara three times in the Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra, and some passages he is described as a cosmic man, similar to how the Puranas depict Vishnu or Shiva. However, this Buddhist myth only focuses on how Avalokiteshvara gives birth to all the gods (devas), and he is not depicted as a true Creator God (who creates the cosmos, like the Hindu Īśvara), instead he is depicted as a great cosmic being that manifests in myriad ways as a skillful means to guide living beings to Buddhahood.

==Tibetan Buddhist beliefs==
Avalokiteśvara is an important deity in Tibetan Buddhism. He is regarded in the Vajrayana teachings as a Buddha.

In Tibetan Buddhism, Tãrã came into existence from a single tear shed by Avalokiteśvara. When the tear fell to the ground it created a lake, and a lotus opening in the lake revealed Tara. In another version of this story, Tara emerges from the heart of Avalokiteśvara. In either version, it is Avalokiteśvara&#x27;s outpouring of compassion which manifests Tãrã as a being.

Certain living tulku lineages, including the Dalai Lamas and the Karmapas, are considered by many Tibetan Buddhists to also be manifestations of Avalokiteśvara.

<text>The Battle of Monmouth, also known as the Battle of Monmouth Court House, was fought near Monmouth Court House in modern-day Freehold Borough, New Jersey, on June 28, 1778, during the American Revolutionary War. It pitted the Continental Army, commanded by General George Washington, against the British Army in North America, commanded by General Sir Henry Clinton.

It was the last battle of the Philadelphia campaign, begun the previous year, during which the British had inflicted two major defeats on Washington and occupied Philadelphia. Washington had spent the winter at Valley Forge rebuilding his army and defending his position against political enemies who favored his replacement as commander-in-chief. This included Major General Horatio Gates, whose political alliance with the “Conway Cabal” threatened General Washington&#x27;s status as commander-in-chief. In February 1778, the French-American Treaty of Alliance tilted the strategic balance in favor of the Americans, forcing the British to abandon hopes of a military victory and adopt a defensive strategy. Clinton was ordered to evacuate Philadelphia and consolidate his army. The Continental Army shadowed the British as they marched across New Jersey to Sandy Hook, from where the Royal Navy would ferry them to New York. Washington&#x27;s senior officers urged varying degrees of caution, but it was politically important for him not to allow the British to withdraw unscathed. Washington detached around a third of his army and sent it ahead under the command of Major General Charles Lee, hoping to land a heavy blow on the British without becoming embroiled in a major engagement.

The battle began badly for the Americans when Lee botched an attack on the British rearguard at Monmouth Court House. A counter-attack by the main British column forced Lee to retreat until Washington arrived with the main body. Clinton disengaged when he found Washington in an unassailable defensive position and resumed the march to Sandy Hook.

Clinton had divided his army into two divisions for the march from Philadelphia; most of the combat troops were concentrated in the first division, while the second comprised most of the heavy transport of a 1,500-wagon baggage train. The British were harassed by increasingly strong American forces as they traversed New Jersey, and by June 27, 1778, Lee&#x27;s vanguard was within striking distance. When the British left Monmouth Court House the next day, Lee attempted to isolate and defeat their rearguard. The attack was poorly coordinated, and the Americans were quickly outnumbered when the British first division returned. Some of Lee&#x27;s units began to withdraw, leading to a breakdown in command and control and forcing Lee to order a general retreat. A fiercely fought rearguard action by the vanguard gave Washington enough time to deploy the main body in a strong defensive position, against which British efforts to press the vanguard foundered. The infantry battle gave way to a two-hour artillery duel, during which Clinton began to disengage. The duel ended when a Continental brigade established artillery on a hill overlooking the British lines, forcing Clinton to withdraw his guns. Washington launched two small-unit attacks on Clinton&#x27;s infantry as they withdrew, inflicting heavy casualties on the British during the second. An attempt by Washington to probe the British flanks was halted by sunset, and the two armies settled down within of each other. The British slipped away unnoticed during the night to link up with the baggage train. The rest of the march to Sandy Hook was completed without further incident, and Clinton&#x27;s army was ferried to New York in early July.

The battle was tactically inconclusive and strategically irrelevant; neither side landed the blow they hoped to on the other, Washington&#x27;s army remained an effective force in the field, and the British redeployed successfully to New York. Both sides sustained considerable casualties, though the majority were from heat-related illness and exhaustion rather than combat. The Continental Army is estimated to have inflicted more losses than it received, and it was one of the rare occasions on which it retained possession of a battlefield. It had proven itself to be much improved after the training it underwent over the winter, and the professional conduct of the American troops during the battle was widely noted by the British. Washington was able to present the battle as a triumph, and he was voted a formal thanks by Congress to honor &quot;the important victory of Monmouth over the British grand army.&quot; His position as commander-in-chief became unassailable. He was lauded for the first time as the father of his country, and his detractors were silenced. Lee was vilified for his failure to press home the attack on the British rearguard. Because of his tactless efforts to argue his case in the days after the battle, Washington had him arrested and court-martialed on charges of disobeying orders, conducting an &quot;unnecessary, disorderly, and shameful retreat&quot; and disrespect towards the commander-in-chief. Lee made the fatal mistake of turning the proceedings into a contest between himself and Washington. He was found guilty on all counts, although his culpability on the first two charges was debatable.

Today, the site of the battle is a New Jersey State Park that preserves the land for the public, called Monmouth Battlefield State Park.

==Background==

In 1777, some two years into the American Revolutionary War, the British commander-in-chief General Sir William Howe launched the Philadelphia campaign to capture the rebels&#x27; capital and persuade them to sue for peace. In the fall of that year, Howe inflicted two significant defeats on General George Washington and his Continental Army, at Brandywine and Germantown, and occupied Philadelphia, forcing the Second Continental Congress to hurriedly decamp to York, Pennsylvania. Washington avoided battle for the rest of the year, and in December he withdrew to winter quarters at Valley Forge, despite the desire of Congress that he continue campaigning. In comparison, his subordinate General Horatio Gates had won major victories in September and October at the Battles of Saratoga. Washington was criticized in some quarters within the army and Congress for relying on a Fabian strategy to wear the British down in a long war of attrition instead of defeating it decisively in a pitched battle.

In November, Washington was hearing rumors of a &quot;Strong Faction&quot; within Congress that favored replacing him with Gates as commander-in-chief. The congressional appointments of the known critic General Thomas Conway as Inspector General of the Army and of Gates to the Board of War and Ordnance in December convinced Washington there was a conspiracy to take command of the army from him. Over a winter in which supplies were scarce and deaths from disease accounted for 15 per cent of his force, he battled to keep both the army from dissolution and his position as its commander-in-chief. He successfully waged a &quot;clever campaign of political infighting&quot; in which he presented a public image of disinterest, a man without guile or ambition, while working through his allies in Congress and the army to silence his critics. Nevertheless, the doubts about his leadership remained, and he needed success on the battlefield if he was to be sure of his position.

The British, meanwhile, had failed to eliminate the Continental Army and force a decisive end to the American rebellion, despite investing significant resources in North America to the detriment of defenses elsewhere in the empire. In Europe, France was maneuvering to exploit the opportunity to weaken a long-term rival. Following the Franco-American alliance of February 1778, French forces were sent to North America to support the revolutionaries. This led to the Anglo-French War (1778–1783), which Spain joined on the French side in 1779. With the rest of Europe moving towards a hostile neutrality, Great Britain would come under further pressure in 1780 when the Dutch allied with France, leading to the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. Faced with military escalation, increasing diplomatic isolation and limited resources, the British were forced to prioritize the defense of the homeland and more valuable colonial possessions in the Caribbean and India above their North American colonies. They abandoned their efforts to win a decisive military victory, repealed the Intolerable Acts that had precipitated the rebellion and, in April 1778, sent the Carlisle Peace Commission in an attempt to reach a negotiated settlement. In Philadelphia, the newly installed commander-in-chief General Sir Henry Clinton was ordered to redeploy 8,000 troops, a third of his army, to the West Indies and Florida, consolidate the rest of his army in New York and adopt a defensive posture.

===Continental Army===

Washington&#x27;s preference for a professional standing army rather than a militia had been another source of criticism. He had seen his army dissolve in the fall of 1775 as short-term enlistments expired, and blamed his defeat in the Battle of Long Island in August 1776 in part on a poorly performing militia. At his urging, Congress passed legislation between September and December 1776 to create an army in which troops would enlist for the duration. Recruitment failed to raise sufficient numbers, and the harsh discipline implemented by Washington, the long periods away from home and the defeats of 1777 further weakened the army through desertions and frequent officer resignations.

Although the army that went into Valley Forge contained the kernel of regimental organization and a core of experienced officers and men, no-one was under any illusion that it was a match for the tactical skill of the British Army. The situation improved measurably with the arrival in March 1778 of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, to whom Washington gave the responsibility for training the army. With the commander-in-chief&#x27;s enthusiastic support, Steuben implemented a uniform standard of drill where none had previously existed and worked the army hard, transforming it into a more professional force that might compete on equal terms with the British Army.

On May 21, Major General Charles Lee rejoined the Continental Army. Lee was a former British Army officer who had retired to Virginia before the revolution and had been touted as a potential commander of the army alongside Washington when war broke out. He had been captured in December 1776 following Washington&#x27;s defeat at New York, and had been released in April in a prisoner exchange. He had been critical of Washington&#x27;s indecisiveness at New York and insubordinate during the retreat from the city. But Washington had regarded him as his most trusted adviser and the best officer in the Continental Army, and he eagerly welcomed Lee back as his second-in-command.

Sixteen months in captivity had not mellowed Lee. He remained respectful to Washington&#x27;s face but continued to be critical about the commander-in-chief&#x27;s abilities to others, and it is likely that Washington&#x27;s friends reported this back to Washington. Lee was dismissive of the Continental Army, denigrated Steuben&#x27;s efforts to improve it and went over Washington&#x27;s head to submit to Congress a plan to reorganize it on a militia basis, prompting Washington to reprove him. Nevertheless, Lee was respected by many of Washington&#x27;s officers and held in high esteem by Congress, and Washington gave him command of the division that would soon lead the Continental Army out of Valley Forge.

===Prelude===

In April, before news of the French alliance reached him, Washington issued a memorandum to his generals seeking their opinions on three possible alternatives for the upcoming campaign: attack the British in Philadelphia, shift operations to New York or remain on the defensive at Valley Forge and continue to build up the army. Of the twelve responses, all agreed it was vital that, whatever course was chosen, the army had to perform well if public support for the revolution was to be maintained after the disappointments of the previous year. Most generals supported one or other of the offensive options, but Washington sided with the minority, among them Steuben, who argued the Continental Army still needed improvement at Valley Forge before it was ready to take on the British. After news of the Franco-American alliance arrived and as British activity in and around Philadelphia increased, Washington met with ten of his generals on May 8 to further discuss plans. This time they unanimously favored the defensive option and waiting until the British intentions became clearer.

In May, it became evident that the British were preparing to evacuate Philadelphia, but Washington still had no detailed knowledge of Clinton&#x27;s intentions and was concerned that the British would slip away overland through New Jersey. The 2nd New Jersey Regiment, which had been conducting operations against British foragers and sympathizers in New Jersey since March, was a valuable source of intelligence, and by the end of the month a British evacuation by land looked increasingly likely. Washington reinforced the regiment with the rest of the New Jersey Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General William Maxwell, with orders to obstruct and harry British activities. The Continentals were to co-operate with the experienced New Jersey militia, commanded by Major General Philemon Dickinson, one of the most capable militia commanders of the war and Washington&#x27;s single best source of intelligence on British activities. On May 18, Washington sent the inexperienced, 20-year-old Major General Lafayette with 2,200 men to establish an observation post at Barren Hill, from Philadelphia. The Frenchman&#x27;s first significant independent command almost ended in disaster for him two days later in the Battle of Barren Hill, and only the discipline of his men prevented his entrapment by the British.

==March from Philadelphia==

On June 15, the British began to withdraw from Philadelphia, crossing the River Delaware into New Jersey. The last troops crossed three days later, and the army consolidated around Haddonfield. Clinton, who had not yet decided on the exact route to New York approximately away, divided his army into two divisions and set out for Allentown, some to the northeast. He accompanied the first division, which comprised some 10,000 troops under the command of Lieutenant General Charles Lord Cornwallis. The second division, commanded by Lieutenant General Wilhelm von Knyphausen, comprised just over 9,000 personnel, of which over 7,500 were combatants. This division contained the bulk of the slow-moving heavy transport of the 1,500-wagon baggage train.

The march was conducted in short segments during a heat wave in which temperatures frequently exceeded , which further slowed progress and caused casualties from heat exhaustion. The slow progress did not concern Clinton. He was confident his troops were more than a match for Washington&#x27;s forces and felt that a major battle would compensate for the humiliation of having to abandon Philadelphia and might even deal a serious blow to the rebellion. Wherever possible, the two divisions followed parallel routes that allowed them to be mutually supporting. Light troops and pioneers screened the route ahead of the main force and cleared obstacles, combat units were embedded with the baggage train and battalion-sized units provided flank guards. The frequent sniping and skirmishing of Maxwell&#x27;s Continentals and Dickinson&#x27;s militia, and their attempts to obstruct and hinder the British by blocking roads, destroying bridges and spoiling wells, did not materially impede progress.

On June 24, the first division arrived at Allentown while the second reached Imlaystown, to the east. Clinton decided to head for Sandy Hook, from where the Royal Navy could ferry his army to New York. When the march resumed at 04:00 the next day, the road network made it impossible for the two divisions to follow separate routes and still remain within supporting distance of each other. Knyphausen&#x27;s second division led the column on the road towards Monmouth Court House (modern-day Freehold). Cornwallis followed, Guards and Grenadiers at the rear, putting his combat-heavy division between the baggage train and the likely direction of attack. At the end of the day, Knyphausen camped at Freehold Township, some from Monmouth Court House, while Clinton established his headquarters at Robin&#x27;s Rising Sun Tavern, from Knyphausen.

The next day, June 26, the British suffered almost forty casualties in near-constant skirmishing in which one unit came close to being overrun. Knyphausen reached Monmouth Court House early that morning, and by 10:00 the entire column had concentrated there. It was clear to Clinton that Washington&#x27;s forces were gathering in numbers, and the British were exhausted after their march from Philadelphia. Monmouth Court House offered a good defensive position, and it is possible that Clinton saw an opportunity for the battle he desired. He deployed his army to cover all approaches and decided to rest his troops for the next two nights. The bulk of his force, the first division, was deployed on the Allentown road, covering the second division in the village.

The revolution had precipitated a vicious civil war in Monmouth County that did credit to neither side and which would continue after the armies had departed. It was fought between Patriots, who sided with the rebellion, and Loyalists, who remained loyal to Great Britain and even formed units, such as the Queen&#x27;s American Rangers, which fought alongside the British Army. The two sides also fought each other in the civil arena, and it is estimated that fifty per cent of Monmouth County families suffered significant harm to person or property during the war. By spring 1778, the formerly loyalist Monmouth Court House had come under patriot control. When the British arrived, they found themselves in an enemy settlement that had been largely deserted by its inhabitants. Clinton&#x27;s orders against pillaging were ignored by the rank and file and went unenforced by the officers. British and Hessian soldiers acting out of frustration and anger, and Loyalists acting out of rage and vengeance, committed numerous acts of vandalism, looting and arson. By the time Clinton resumed the march on June 28, thirteen of the village&#x27;s near two dozen buildings had been destroyed, all of them Patriot owned.

===Pursuit===
Washington learned the British were evacuating Philadelphia on June 17. He immediately convened a war council, at which all but two of seventeen generals believed the Continental Army still could not win a pitched battle against the British, Lee arguing it would be criminal to attempt one. Unsure of Clinton&#x27;s exact intentions and with his officers urging caution, Washington determined to pursue the British and move to within striking distance. Lee&#x27;s brigades led the Continental Army out of Valley Forge on the afternoon of June 18, and four days later the last troops crossed the Delaware into New Jersey at Coryell&#x27;s Ferry. Washington divided his army into two wings commanded by Lee and Major General Lord Stirling and a reserve commanded by Lafayette. Traveling light, Washington reached Hopewell on June 23, less than north of the British at Allentown. While the army set up camp, Colonel Daniel Morgan was ordered south with 600 light infantry to reinforce Maxwell and Dickinson.

On June 24, at the Joseph Stout House (Hunt House), Dickinson informed Washington that the efforts he and Maxwell were making to slow Clinton were having little impact, and that he believed Clinton was deliberately lingering in New Jersey to provoke a battle. Washington convened another war council in which the twelve officers who attended all recommended varying degrees of caution. Lee argued that a victory would be of little benefit while a defeat would do irrevocable damage to the revolutionary cause. He preferred not to risk the Continental Army against a professional, well-trained enemy until French intervention swayed the odds in the Americans&#x27; favor and proposed that Clinton should be allowed to proceed to New York unmolested. Four other generals agreed. Even the most aggressive of the remainder wanted to avoid a major engagement; Brigadier General Anthony Wayne suggested the dispatch of 2,500–3,000 additional troops to reinforce Maxwell and Dickinson that would enable them, with a third of the army, to make &quot;an Impression in force.&quot; In the end, a compromise was agreed in which 1,500 picked men would reinforce the vanguard to &quot;act as occasion may serve.&quot; To Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Hamilton, who attended as an aide, the council &quot;would have done honor to the most honorab[le] society of midwives, and to them only.&quot; A disappointed Washington sent the token force under the command of Brigadier General Charles Scott.

Soon after the council adjourned, Wayne – who had refused to put his name to the compromise – Lafayette and Major General Nathanael Greene contacted Washington individually with the same plea for a stronger vanguard action supported by the main body, while still avoiding a major battle. Lafayette assured Washington that Steuben and Brigadier General Louis Duportail agreed, and told Washington it &quot;would be disgraceful for the leaders and humiliating for the troops to allow the enemy to cross the Jerseys with impunity.&quot; Greene emphasized the political aspect, advising Washington the public expected him to attack and that even if a limited attack did lead to a major battle, he thought their chances of success were good. It was all Washington, keen to erase the defeats of the previous year and prove his critics wrong, needed to hear. By the early hours of June 25 he had ordered Wayne to follow Scott with another 1,000 picked men. He wanted to do more than simply harass Clinton and, while still avoiding the risk of a major battle, hoped to inflict a heavy blow on the British, one that would surpass his success at the Battle of Trenton in 1776.

===Reining in Lafayette===

Washington offered Lee command of the vanguard, but Lee declined, stating the force was too small for a man of his rank and position. Washington appointed Lafayette instead, with orders to attack &quot;with the whole force of your command&quot; if the opportunity presented itself. Lafayette failed to establish full control of the disparate forces under his command, and in his haste to catch the British, he pushed his troops to breaking point and outran his supplies. Washington grew increasingly concerned, and on the morning of June 26 he warned Lafayette not to &quot;distress your men by an over hasty march.&quot; By that afternoon, Lafayette was at Robin&#x27;s Tavern, where Clinton had stayed the previous night. He was within three miles of the British, too far away from the main army for it to support him, and his men were exhausted and hungry. He remained eager to fight and discussed with his officers a night march with the intention of striking Clinton the next morning.

That evening, Washington ordered Lafayette to leave Morgan and the militia behind as a screen and move to Englishtown, where he would be back in range of both supplies and the main army. By this time Lee, having realized Lafayette&#x27;s force was more significant than he first thought, had changed his mind and requested command of it. Washington ordered Lee to take Scott&#x27;s former brigade and the brigade of Brigadier General James Varnum, link up with Lafayette in Englishtown and take command of all advance forces. Greene took over command of Lee&#x27;s wing of the main body. By June 27, Lafayette was safely back in the fold with what was now Lee&#x27;s vanguard of some 4,500 troops at Englishtown, from the British at Monmouth Court House. Washington was with the main body of just over 7,800 troops and the bulk of the artillery at Manalapan Bridge, behind Lee. Morgan&#x27;s light infantry, now increased to 800 men by the addition of a militia detachment, was at Richmond Mills, a little over to the south of Monmouth Court House. Dickinson&#x27;s 1,200 or more militia were on Clinton&#x27;s flanks, with a significant concentration about west of Monmouth Court House.

==Battle==
On the afternoon of June 27, Washington conferred with the vanguard&#x27;s senior officers at Englishtown but did not offer a battle plan. Lee believed he had full discretion on whether and how to attack and called his own war council after Washington left. He intended to advance as soon as he knew Clinton was on the move, in the hope of catching the British rearguard when it was most vulnerable. In the absence of any intelligence about Clinton&#x27;s intentions or the terrain, Lee believed it would be useless to form a precise plan of his own; he told his commanders only to be ready for action at short notice and follow his orders. In response to a written order received from Washington in the early hours of June 28, Lee ordered Colonel William Grayson to take 700 men forward. They were to watch for any British move and, if one did occur, try to slow them to give the vanguard time to close the distance.

Grayson did not depart Englishtown until 06:00, an hour after news arrived that Clinton was on the move. Both vanguard and main body broke camp immediately, and both were slow to move; the vanguard was delayed when brigades formed up in the wrong march order and the main body was slowed by its artillery train. At 07:00, Lee rode ahead to scout the situation for himself. Following some confusion when a militia rider erroneously reported the British were not withdrawing but preparing to attack, Lee learned that the British had begun moving at 02:00 and only a small party of infantry and cavalry remained in the area.

Clinton&#x27;s first move had been to deploy the Queen&#x27;s Rangers northwest of Monmouth Court House to cover the departure of the second division, scheduled for an hour later but delayed until 04:00. By 05:00, the first division had begun moving, and the last British troops left Monmouth Court House by 09:15, heading northeast on the road to Middletown. Trailing the column was the rearguard, comprising a battalion of light infantry and a regiment of dragoons which, with the Rangers, totaled 1,550–2,000 troops.

===Advance to contact===

The first shots were exchanged around 08:00 in an entirely American skirmish between a small detachment of Rangers and Dickinson&#x27;s militia. Grayson arrived just in time to deploy his troops in support of the militia near a bridge over a ravine and watch the Rangers withdraw. The bridge was on the Englishtown–Monmouth Court House road and spanned the Spotswood Middle Brook, one of three ravines bordered by marshy wetlands or &#x27;morasses&#x27; that cut through what would soon become a battlefield. Other than by bridge, the ravines were negotiable with difficulty by infantry and not at all by artillery; any unit cut off on the wrong side or pinned up against them would find itself in grave danger. When Lee caught up with Grayson shortly after the skirmish, Dickinson, who still believed the British occupied Monmouth Court House in force, strongly urged him not to venture across the brook. With intelligence about British activity still contradictory, Lee lost an hour at the bridge. He did not advance until Lafayette arrived with the rest of the vanguard.

Once the vanguard was concentrated at the bridge, Lee replaced Grayson with Wayne to command the approximately 550-man lead element, which comprised detachments led by Colonel Richard Butler, Colonel Henry Jackson and Grayson (returned to the command of his original composite battalion of Virginians), supported by four artillery. The vanguard advanced along the Englishtown road towards Monmouth Court House until it reached the junction with the road north to Foreman&#x27;s Mill at around 09:30. Lee went forward with Wayne to reconnoiter Monmouth Court House, where they discovered the British rearguard. Estimating the British strength at some 2,000 men, Lee decided on a plan to hook round to their rear. He left Wayne with orders to fix the rearguard in place and returned to the rest of the vanguard to lead it on a left flanking maneuver. Lee&#x27;s confidence crept into reports back to Washington that implied &quot;the certainty of success.&quot;

After Lee departed, Butler&#x27;s detachment exchanged fire with mounted troops screening the rearguard, prompting the British to begin withdrawing to the northeast, towards the main column. In the subsequent pursuit, Wayne repulsed a charge by British dragoons and launched a feint against the British infantry, prompting the rearguard to halt and form up on a hill at the junction of the Middletown and Shrewsbury roads. Meanwhile, because Lee was leading the rest of the vanguard himself, he neglected to provide Scott and Maxwell with a detailed plan. After a march, he emerged from some woods at around 10:30, in time to witness Wayne&#x27;s troops in action to his left.

When it became evident the British were present in considerably larger numbers than he had anticipated, Lee operated with Lafayette to secure what he considered to be a vulnerable right flank. On the left flank, the appearance of another British force 2,000–3,000 strong prompted Jackson to pull his regiment back from its isolated position on the banks of Spotswood North Brook. In the vanguard center, Scott and Maxwell, who was to Scott&#x27;s left, were not in communication with Lee and not privy to his plan. They felt increasingly isolated watching Lee push out the right flank, and with British troops marching towards Monmouth Court House to their south, they became apprehensive about being cut off. They agreed between themselves to adjust their positions; Scott fell back a short distance southwest across the Spotswood Middle Brook to a more defensible position while Maxwell pulled back with the intention of circling round and coming up on Scott&#x27;s right flank.

Lee was dumbfounded when the two staff officers he had sent with orders for Scott returned with the news that he was nowhere to be found and disconcerted by their reports of the British returning in force. When he observed part of Lafayette&#x27;s force retreating after a failed attempt to silence some British artillery, it appeared to Lee that the right flank too was pulling back without orders. It had become clear that he was losing control of the vanguard, and with his immediate command now only 2,500 strong, he realized his plan to envelop the British rearguard was finished. His priority now was the safety of his command in the face of superior numbers.

===Counter-attack and retreat===

As soon as he received news that his rearguard was being probed, Clinton ordered Cornwallis to march the first division back towards Monmouth Court House. He believed Washington&#x27;s main body was not close enough to come up in support and that the terrain would make it difficult for Lee to maneuver. He intended to do more than simply defend his baggage train; he thought the vanguard was vulnerable, and saw an opportunity to turn its right flank, just as Lee had feared, and destroy it. After pausing at Monmouth Court House, Clinton began to push westwards. He formed his best troops into two columns, Guards on the right, Grenadiers on the left and the guns of the Royal Artillery between them, while a regiment of dragoons ranged about them. The infantry of the 3rd and 4th Brigades followed in line, while the 5th Brigade remained in reserve at Monmouth Court House. The Queen&#x27;s Rangers and the infantry of the rearguard operated on the British right flank. To the rear, a brigade of Hessian grenadiers remained in a defensive line to which Clinton could fall back if things went badly. In total, his force comprised some 10,000 troops.

Lee ordered a general retreat to a line about to the west of Monmouth Court House that ran from Craig&#x27;s House, north of Spotswood Middle Brook, to Ker&#x27;s House, south of the brook. He had significant difficulties communicating with his subordinates and exhausted his aides attempting to do so. Although he arrived in the vicinity of Ker&#x27;s house with a sizeable force by noon, he was unable to exercise command and control of it as a unified organization. As disorganized as the retreat was for Lee, at unit level it was generally conducted with a discipline that did credit to Steuben&#x27;s training. The Americans suffered only some one dozen casualties as they fell back, an indication of how little major fighting there was; there were no organized volleys by infantry muskets, and only the artillery engaged in any significant action. Lee believed he had conducted a model &quot;retrograde manoeuver in the face and under fire of an enemy&quot; and claimed his troops moved with &quot;order and precision.&quot; He had remained calm during the retreat but began to unravel at Ker&#x27;s house. When two of Washington&#x27;s aides informed Lee that the main body was still some away and asked him what to report back, Lee replied &quot;that he really did not know what to say.&quot; Crucially, he failed to keep Washington informed of the retreat.

Lee realized that a knoll in front of his lines would give the British, now deployed from column into line formation, command of the ground and render his position untenable. With no knowledge of the main body&#x27;s whereabouts and believing he had little choice, Lee decided to fall back farther, across the Spotswood Middle Brook bridge. He believed he would be able to hold the British there from Perrine&#x27;s Hill until the main body came up in support. With his aides out of action, Lee pressed whomever he could find into service as messengers to organize the withdrawal. It was during this period that he sent the army auditor, Major John Clark, to Washington with news of the retreat. But Washington was by now aware, having learned from Lee&#x27;s troops who had already crossed the ravine.

===Washington&#x27;s arrival===
The main body had reached Englishtown at 10:00, and by noon it was still some from Monmouth Court House. Without any recent news from Lee, Washington had no reason to be concerned. At Tennent&#x27;s Meeting House, some east of Englishtown, he ordered Greene to take Brigadier General William Woodford&#x27;s brigade of some 550 men and 4 artillery pieces south then east to cover the right flank. The rest of the main body continued east along the Englishtown–Monmouth Court House road. In the space of some ten minutes, Washington&#x27;s confidence gave way to alarm as he encountered a straggler bearing the first news of Lee&#x27;s retreat and then whole units in retreat. None of the officers Washington met could tell him where they were supposed to be going or what they were supposed to be doing. As the commander-in-chief rode on ahead, over the bridge and towards the front line, he saw the vanguard in full retreat but no sign of the British. At around 12:45, Washington found Lee marshalling the last of his command across the middle morass, marshy ground southeast of the bridge.

Expecting praise for a retreat he believed had been generally conducted in good order, Lee was uncharacteristically lost for words when Washington asked without pleasantries, &quot;I desire to know, sir, what is the reason – whence arises this disorder and confusion?&quot; When he regained his composure, Lee attempted to explain his actions. He blamed faulty intelligence and his officers, especially Scott, for pulling back without orders, leaving him no choice but to retreat in the face of a superior force, and reminded Washington that he had opposed the attack in the first place. Washington was not convinced; &quot;All this may be very true, sir,&quot; he replied, &quot;but you ought not to have undertaken it unless you intended to go through with it.&quot; Washington made it clear he was disappointed with Lee and rode off to organize the battle he felt his subordinate should have given. Lee followed at a distance, bewildered and believing he had been relieved of command.

With the main body still arriving and the British no more than away, Washington began to rally the vanguard to set up the very defenses Lee had been attempting to organize. The commander-in-chief directed Wayne to take three battalions and form a rearguard in the Point of Woods, south of the Spotswood Middle Brook, that could delay the British. He issued orders for the 2nd New Jersey Regiment and two smaller Pennsylvanian regiments to deploy on the slopes of Perrine&#x27;s Hill, north of the brook overlooking the bridge; they would be the rallying point for the rest of the vanguard and the position on which the main body would form. Washington offered Lee a choice: remain and command the rearguard, or fall back to and organize the main body. Lee opted for the former and, as Washington departed to take care of the latter, promised he would &quot;be the last one to leave the field.&quot;

===American rearguard action===

Lee positioned himself with four guns supported by two infantry battalions on the crest of a hill to the right of Wayne. As the British advanced – Guards on the right, Grenadiers on the left – they passed the Point of Woods, oblivious to the Continentals concealed in them. Wayne&#x27;s troops inflicted up to forty casualties. The Guards reacted as they were trained and with the support of the dragoons and some of the Grenadiers, crashed into the Americans at the charge. Within ten minutes, Wayne&#x27;s three battalions were being chased back to the bridge. The rest of the Grenadiers, meanwhile, continued to advance on Lee&#x27;s position, pushing the Continental artillery back to a hedgerow to which the two infantry battalions had already withdrawn. Another short, sharp fight ensued until Lee, seeing both flanks being turned, ordered his men to follow Wayne back across the bridge.

As Lee and Wayne fought south of the Spotswood Middle Brook, Washington was deploying the main body on Perrine&#x27;s Hill, northwest of the bridge across the brook. Stirling&#x27;s wing had just taken up positions on the American left flank when its artillery started to engage troops of the British 3rd Brigade. Clinton had earlier ordered the brigade to move right, cross the brook and cut the vanguard&#x27;s line of retreat at the bridge. After the infantry of the 42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot crossed the brook, they ran into three battalions of Scott&#x27;s detachment retreating westwards. Under pressure from the Highlanders, the Continentals continued through an orchard to the safety of Stirling&#x27;s line while Stirling&#x27;s artillery forced the Highlanders back to the orchard. A second battalion of Highlanders and the 44th Regiment of Foot that had swung right and crossed the Spotswood North Brook were also persuaded by the artillery to retreat. Even farther to the right, an attempt to outflank Stirling&#x27;s position by the Queen&#x27;s Rangers and the light infantry of the rearguard lacked the strength to carry it through, and they too fell back to join the 3rd Brigade.

At 13:30, Lee was one of the last American officers to withdraw across Spotswood Middle Brook. The rearguard action had lasted no more than thirty minutes, enough time for Washington to complete the deployment of the main body. When a battalion of Grenadiers led by Lieutenant Colonel Henry Monckton chased Lee&#x27;s troops over the bridge, the British found themselves facing Wayne&#x27;s detachment reforming some away. As the Grenadiers advanced to engage Wayne they came under heavy fire from Stirling&#x27;s artillery, another behind Wayne. Monckton became the highest-ranking British casualty of the day, and in the face of an unexpectedly strong enemy, the Grenadiers retreated back across the bridge to the hedgerow from which they had expelled Lee earlier.

Washington had acted decisively to form a strong defensive position anchored on the right above the bridge on the Englishtown road and extending in a gentle curve up the slope of Perrine&#x27;s Hill. When Lee joined it, Washington sent him with two battalions of Maxwell&#x27;s New Jersey Brigade, around half of Scott&#x27;s detachment and some other units of the former vanguard to form a reserve at Englishtown. The rest of the vanguard, which included the other half of Scott&#x27;s detachment and most of Wayne&#x27;s, remained with Washington. The infantry battle gave way to a two-hour artillery duel across the of no-man&#x27;s land on either side of the brook, in which both sides suffered more casualties due to heat exhaustion than they did from enemy cannon.

===British withdrawal===

Clinton had lost the initiative. He saw no prospect of success assaulting a strong enemy position in the brutal heat, and decided to break off the engagement. His first task was to bring in his isolated right flank – the 3rd Brigade, Rangers and light infantry still sheltering in the orchard north of Spotswood Middle Brook. While the Highlanders of the 42nd Regiment remained in place to cover the withdrawal, the remainder fell back across the brook to join the Grenadiers at the hedgerow. Around 15:45, while the withdrawal was in progress, Greene arrived with Woodford&#x27;s brigade at Combs Hill overlooking the British left flank and opened fire with his artillery. Clinton was forced to withdraw his own artillery, bringing the cannonade with Washington&#x27;s guns on Perrine&#x27;s Hill to an end, and move the Grenadiers to sheltered ground at the north end of the hedgerow.

At 16:30, Washington learned of 3rd Brigade&#x27;s withdrawal and launched the first American offensive action in six hours. He ordered two battalions of picked men &quot;to go and see what [you] could do with the enemy&#x27;s right wing.&quot; Only one battalion some 350 strong led by Colonel Joseph Cilley actually made it into action. Cilley made good use of cover along the Spotswood North Brook to close with and engage the 275–325 troops of the 42nd Regiment in the orchard. The Highlanders found themselves in a disadvantageous position and, with the rest of British right flank already departed, they had no reason to stay. They conducted a fighting retreat in good order with minimal casualties. To the British, the rebels were &quot;unsuccessful in endeavouring to annoy.&quot; To the Americans, it was a significant psychological victory over one of the British Army&#x27;s most feared regiments.

As his right flank pulled back, Clinton issued orders for what he intended to be a phased general withdrawal back towards Monmouth Court House. His subordinates misunderstood. Instead of waiting until the 3rd Brigade had rejoined before pulling back, all but the 1st Grenadier Battalion withdrew immediately, leaving it and the 3rd Brigade dangerously exposed. Washington was buoyed by what he saw of Cilley&#x27;s attack, and although he lacked specific intelligence about what the British were doing, the fact that their artillery had gone quiet suggested they might be vulnerable. He ordered Wayne to conduct an opportunistic advance with a detachment of Pennsylvanians.

Wayne&#x27;s request for three brigades, some 1,300 men, was denied, and at 16:45 he crossed the bridge over Spotswood Middle Brook with just 400 troops of the Third Pennsylvania Brigade. The Pennsylvanians caught the 650–700 men of the lone Grenadier battalion in the process of withdrawing, giving the British scant time to form up and receive the attack. The Grenadiers were &quot;losing men very fast&quot;, Clinton wrote later, before the 33rd Regiment of Foot arrived with 300–350 men to support them. The British pushed back, and the Pennsylvanian Brigade began to disintegrate as it retreated to Parsonage farm. The longest infantry battle of the day ended when the Continental artillery on Combs Hill stopped the British counter-attack in its tracks and forced the Grenadiers and infantry to withdraw.

Washington planned to resume the battle the next day, and at 18:00 he ordered four brigades he had previously sent back to the reserve at Englishtown to return. When they arrived, they took over Stirling&#x27;s positions on Perrine&#x27;s Hill, allowing Stirling to advance across the Spotswood Middle Brook and take up new positions near the hedgerow. An hour later, Washington ordered a reinforced brigade commanded by Brigadier General Enoch Poor to probe Clinton&#x27;s right flank while Woodford&#x27;s brigade was to drop down from Combs Hill and probe Clinton&#x27;s left flank. Their cautious advance was halted by sunset before making contact with the British, and the two armies settled down for the night within of each other, the closest British troops at Ker&#x27;s House. After Clinton&#x27;s forces withdrew, American troops began to plunder British corpses in search of valuables, leading to several American soldiers ransacking nearby homes occupied by civilians who had fled there to escape the battle. When news of this reached Washington, he ordered the packs of soldiers suspected of looting to be searched.

While the battle was raging, Knyphausen had led the baggage train to safety. His second division covered by the Hessian Jägers under Lieutenant Colonel Wurmb endured only light harassment from militia along the way, and eventually set up camp some from Middletown. With the baggage train secure, Clinton had no intention of resuming the battle. At 23:00, he began withdrawing his troops. The first division slipped away unnoticed by Washington&#x27;s forward troops and, after an overnight march, linked back up with Knyphausen&#x27;s second division between 08:00 and 09:00 the next morning.

==Aftermath==

On June 29, Washington withdrew his army to Englishtown, where they rested the next day. The British were in a strong position near Middletown, and their route to Sandy Hook was secure. They completed the march largely untroubled by a militia that considered the threat to have passed and had melted away to tend to crops. The last British troops embarked on naval transports on July 6, and the Royal Navy carried Clinton&#x27;s army to New York. The timing was fortuitous for the British; on July 11, a superior French fleet commanded by Vice Admiral Charles Henri Hector d&#x27;Estaing anchored off Sandy Hook.

The battle was tactically inconclusive and strategically irrelevant; neither side dealt a heavy blow to the other, and the Continental Army remained in the field while the British Army redeployed to New York, just as both would have if the battle had never been fought. Clinton reported 358 total casualties after the battle – 65 killed, 59 died of fatigue, 170 wounded and 64 missing.

Note: Although there are no known listed fatalities of Germans during the retreat a third of the German Auxiliaries were overcome by heat and lay by the roadside; 256 deserted. Possibly these 256 deserters were among 440 (German) deserters (among 600 POWS) in Philadelphia on July 6, 1778. Washington counted some 250 British dead, a figure later revised to a little over 300. Using a typical 18th-century wounded-to-killed ratio of no more than four to one and assuming no more than 160 British dead caused by enemy fire, Lender and Stone calculate the number of wounded could have been up to 640. A Monmouth County Historical Association study estimates total British casualties at 1,134 – comprising 304 dead, 770 wounded and 60 prisoners. Washington reported his own casualties to be 370 – comprising 69 dead, 161 wounded and 140 missing. Using the same wounded-to-killed ratio and assuming a proportion of the missing were fatalities, Lender and Stone estimate Washington&#x27;s casualties could have exceeded 500.

===Claims of victory===
Clinton reported the successful redeployment, in the face of a superior force, of his army to Lord George Germain, Secretary of State for the Colonies. He explained the counter-attack as a diversion intended to protect the baggage train. The battle ended on his own terms, he said, though in private correspondence he conceded that he had also hoped to inflict a decisive defeat on Washington. Having marched his army through the heart of enemy territory without the loss of a single wagon, he congratulated his officers on the &quot;long and difficult retreat in the face of a greatly superior army without being tarnished by the smallest affront.&quot; While some of his officers showed a grudging respect for the Continental Army, their doubts were rooted not in the battlefield but in the realisation that the entry of France into the conflict had swung the strategic balance against Great Britain.

For Washington, the battle was fought at a time of serious misgivings about his effectiveness as commander-in-chief, and it was politically important for him to present it as a victory. On July 1, in his first significant communication to Congress from the front since the disappointments of the previous year, he wrote a full report of the battle. The contents were measured but unambiguous in claiming a significant win, a rare occasion on which the British had left the battlefield and their wounded to the Americans. Congress received it enthusiastically and voted a formal thanks to Washington and the army to honor &quot;the important victory of Monmouth over the British grand army.&quot;

In their accounts of the battle, Washington&#x27;s officers invariably wrote of a major victory, and some took the opportunity to finally put an end to criticism of Washington; Hamilton and Lieutenant Colonel John Laurens, another of Washington&#x27;s aides, wrote to influential friends – in the case of Laurens, his father Henry, President of the Continental Congress – praising Washington&#x27;s leadership. The American press portrayed the battle as a triumph with Washington at its center. Governor William Livingston of New Jersey, who never came any nearer to Monmouth Court House during the campaign than Trenton, almost away, published an anonymous &#x27;eyewitness&#x27; account in the &quot;New Jersey Gazette&quot; only days after the battle, in which he credited the victory to Washington. Articles were still being published in a similar vein in August.

Congressional delegates who were not Washington partisans, such as Samuel Adams and James Lovell, were reluctant to credit Washington but obliged to recognize the importance of the battle and keep to themselves any questions they might have had about the British success in reaching New York. The Washington loyalist Elias Boudinot wrote that &quot;none dare to acknowledge themselves his Enemies.&quot; Washington&#x27;s supporters were emboldened in defending his reputation; in July, Major General John Cadwalader challenged Conway, the officer at the center of what Washington had perceived to be a conspiracy to remove him as commander-in-chief, to a duel in Philadelphia in which Conway was wounded in the mouth. Thomas McKean, chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, was perhaps the only congressional delegate to register his disapproval of the affair, but did not think it wise to bring Cadwalader up before the court to answer for it. Faith in Washington had been restored, Congress became almost deferential to him, public criticism of him all but ceased and for the first time he was hailed as the Father of his Country. The epithet became commonplace by the end of the year, by which time the careers of most of his chief critics had been eclipsed or were in ruins.

===Lee&#x27;s court martial===
Even before the day was out, Lee was cast in the role of villain, and his vilification became an integral part of the narrative Washington&#x27;s lieutenants constructed when they wrote in praise of their commander-in-chief. Lee continued in his post as second-in-command immediately after the battle, and it is likely that the issue would have simply subsided if he had let it go. But on June 30, after protesting his innocence to all who would listen, Lee wrote an insolent letter to Washington in which he blamed &quot;dirty earwigs&quot; for turning Washington against him, claimed his decision to retreat had saved the day and pronounced Washington to be &quot;guilty of an act of cruel injustice&quot; towards him. Instead of the apology Lee was tactlessly seeking, Washington replied that the tone of Lee&#x27;s letter was &quot;highly improper&quot; and that he would initiate an official inquiry into Lee&#x27;s conduct. Lee&#x27;s response demanding a court-martial was again insolent; Washington ordered his arrest and set about obliging him.

The court convened on July 4, and three charges were laid before Lee: disobeying orders in not attacking on the morning of the battle, contrary to &quot;repeated instructions&quot;; conducting an &quot;unnecessary, disorderly, and shameful retreat&quot;; and disrespect towards the commander-in-chief. The trial concluded on August 12, but the accusations and counter-accusations continued until the verdict was confirmed by Congress on December 5. Lee&#x27;s defense was articulate but fatally flawed by his efforts to turn it into a personal contest between himself and Washington. He denigrated the commander-in-chief&#x27;s role in the battle, calling Washington&#x27;s official account &quot;from beginning to end a most abominable damn&#x27;d lie&quot;, and disingenuously cast his own decision to retreat as a &quot;masterful manoeuvre&quot; designed to lure the British onto the main body. Washington remained aloof from the controversy, but his allies portrayed Lee as a traitor who had allowed the British to escape and linked him to the previous winter&#x27;s alleged conspiracy against Washington.

Although the first two charges proved to be dubious, Lee was undeniably guilty of disrespect, and Washington was too powerful to cross. As the historian John Shy noted, &quot;Under the circumstances, an acquittal on the first two charges would have been a vote of no-confidence in Washington.&quot; Lee was found guilty on all three counts, though the court deleted &quot;shameful&quot; from the second and noted the retreat was &quot;disorderly&quot; only &quot;in some few instances.&quot; Lee was suspended from the army for a year, a sentence so lenient that some interpreted it as a vindication of all but the charge of disrespect. Lee&#x27;s fall from grace removed Washington&#x27;s last significant critic from the army and the last realistic alternative to Washington as commander-in-chief, and silenced the last voice to speak in favor of a militia army. Washington&#x27;s position as the &quot;indispensable man&quot; was now unassailable.

===Assessing the Continental Army===
Joseph Bilby and Katherine Jenkins consider the battle to have marked the &quot;coming of age&quot; of a Continental Army that had previously achieved success only in small actions at Trenton and Princeton. Their view is reflected by Joseph Ellis, who writes of Washington&#x27;s belief that &quot;the Continental Army was now a match for British professionals and could hold its own in a conventional, open-field engagement.&quot; Mark Lender and Garry Stone point out that while the Continental Army was unquestionably improved under Steuben&#x27;s tutelage, the battle did not test its ability to meet a professional European army in European-style warfare in which brigades and divisions maneuvered against each other. The only army to mount any major offensive operation on the day was British; the Continental Army fought a largely defensive battle from cover, and a significant portion of it remained out of the fray on Perrine&#x27;s Hill. The few American attacks, such as Cilley&#x27;s, were small-unit actions.

Steuben&#x27;s influence was apparent in the way the rank and file conducted themselves. Half of the troops who marched onto the battlefield at Monmouth in June were new to the army, having been recruited only since January. The significant majority of Lee&#x27;s vanguard comprised ad hoc battalions filled with men picked from numerous regiments. Without any inherent unit cohesion, their effectiveness depended on officers and men who had never before served together using and following the drills they had been taught. That they did so competently was demonstrated throughout the battle, in the advance to contact, Wayne&#x27;s repulse of the dragoons, the orderly retreat in the face of a strong counter-attack and Cilley&#x27;s attack on the Highlanders. The army was well served too by the artillery, which earned high praise from Washington. The professional conduct of the American troops gained widespread recognition even among the British; Clinton&#x27;s secretary wrote, &quot;the Rebels stood much better than ever they did&quot;, and Brigadier General Sir William Erskine, who as commander of the light infantry had traded blows with the Continentals, characterized the battle as a &quot;handsome flogging&quot; for the British, adding, &quot;We had not receiv&#x27;d such an one in America.&quot;

==Legacy==

In keeping with a battle that was more politically than militarily significant, the first reenactment in 1828 was staged to support the presidential candidacy of Andrew Jackson. In another attempt to reenact the battle in 1854, the weather added an authentic touch to the proceedings and the reenactment was called off due to the excessive heat. As the battle receded into history so too did its brutality, to be replaced by a sanitized romanticism. The public memory of the fighting was populated with dramatic images of heroism and glory, as epitomized by Emanuel Leutze&#x27;s &quot;Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth&quot;.

The transformation was aided by the inventiveness of 19th-century historians, none more creative than Washington&#x27;s step-grandson, George Washington Parke Custis, whose account of the battle was as artistic as Leutze&#x27;s painting. Custis was inevitably derogatory towards Lee, and Lee&#x27;s calumny achieved an orthodoxy in such works as Washington Irving&#x27;s &quot;Life of George Washington&quot; (1855–1859) and George Bancroft&#x27;s &quot;History of the United States of America, from the Discovery of the American Continent&quot; (1854–1878). The role Lee had unsuccessfully advanced for the militia in the revolution was finally established in the poetic 19th-century popular narrative, in which the Continental Army was excised from the battle and replaced with patriotic citizen-soldiers.

The battlefield remained largely undisturbed until 1853, when the Freehold and Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad opened a line that cut through the Point of Woods, across the Spotswood Middle Brook and through the Perrine estate. The area became popular with tourists, and the Parsonage, the site of Wayne&#x27;s desperate battle with the Grenadiers and the 33rd Regiment, was a favorite attraction until it was demolished in 1860. During the 19th century, forests were cleared and marshes drained, and by the early 20th century traditional agriculture had been replaced by orchards and truck farms. In 1884, the Monmouth Battle Monument was dedicated outside the modern-day county courthouse in Freehold, near where Wayne&#x27;s troops first brushed with the British rearguard. In the mid 20th century, two battlefield farms were sold to builders, but before the land could be developed, lobbying by state officials, Monmouth County citizens, the Monmouth County Historical Association and the Monmouth County Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution succeeded in initiating a program of preservation. In 1963, the first tract of battlefield land came under state ownership with the purchase of a 200-acre farm. The Monmouth Battlefield State Park was dedicated on the bicentennial of the battle in 1978 and a new visitor center was opened in 2013. By 2015, the park encompassed over 1,800 acres, incorporating most of the land on which the afternoon battle was fought. The state park helped restore a more realistic interpretation of the history of the battle to the public memory, and the Continental Army takes its rightful place in the annual reenactments staged every June.

===Legend of Molly Pitcher===

Five days after the battle, a surgeon treating the wounded reported a patient&#x27;s story of a woman who had taken her husband&#x27;s place working a gun after he was incapacitated. Two accounts attributed to veterans of the battle that surfaced decades later also speak of the actions of a woman during the battle; in one she supplied ammunition to the guns, in the other she brought water to the crews. The story gained prominence during the 19th century and became embellished as the legend of Molly Pitcher. The woman behind Molly Pitcher is most often identified as Mary Ludwig Hays, whose husband William served with the Pennsylvania State Artillery, but it is likely that the legend is an amalgam of more than one woman seen on the battlefield that day; it was not unusual for camp followers to assist in 18th-century battles, though more plausibly in carrying ammunition and water than crewing the guns. Late 20th-century research identified a site near Stirling&#x27;s artillery line as the location of a well from which the legendary Molly drew water, and a historic marker was placed there in 1992.

* The Battle of Monmouth is referenced in the A. W. Burns/George W. Hewitt song &quot;America Shall Aye Be Free&quot;.
*The battle is depicted in the 2012 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III&quot;, where it is intentionally sabotaged by Charles Lee in order to ruin George Washington&#x27;s reputation and replace him as commander of the Continental Army. However, Lee&#x27;s efforts are thwarted by the protagonist Connor, who is able to fend off the British forces and then expose his betrayal to Washington, leading to Lee&#x27;s court martial.
* In her 2014 book &quot;Written in my Own Heart&#x27;s Blood&quot; Diana Gabaldon covers the Battle of Monmouth.
* The battle is mentioned in the song &quot;Stay Alive&quot;, in the Broadway show &quot;&quot;, written by Lin-Manuel Miranda. The song portrays Lee as a fool who gives conflicting instructions to his troops, resulting in massive casualties until Lafayette is called in. At the end of the song, John Laurens challenges Lee to a duel.
* The dramatized machinations of Lee and the battle are depicted in the episode &quot;Gunpowder, Treason and Plot&quot; in the AMC series Turn: Washington&#x27;s Spies.
* Describing the Continental Army under Washington at Valley Forge and the British Army in Philadelphia the battle is the culmination of the historical novel &quot;Monmouth&quot; by Charles Bracelen Flood published in 1961.

<doc id="241431" wikidata="Q886077" url="?curid=241431" title="Chirp Z-transform">
<text>The chirp Z-transform (CZT) is a generalization of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). While the DFT samples the Z plane at uniformly-spaced points along the unit circle, the chirp Z-transform samples along spiral arcs in the Z-plane, corresponding to straight lines in the S plane. The DFT, real DFT, and zoom DFT can be calculated as special cases of the CZT.

Specifically, the chirp Z transform calculates the Z transform at a finite number of points zk along a logarithmic spiral contour, defined as:

:formula_1

:formula_2

where &quot;A&quot; is the complex starting point, &quot;W&quot; is the complex ratio between points, and &quot;M&quot; is the number of points to calculate.

Like the DFT, the chirp Z-transform can be computed in O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) operations where formula_3.
An O(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;) algorithm for the inverse chirp Z-transform (ICZT) was described in 2003, and in 2019.

==Bluestein&#x27;s algorithm==

Bluestein&#x27;s algorithm expresses the CZT as a convolution and implements it efficiently using FFT/IFFT.

As the DFT is a special case of the CZT, this allows the efficient calculation of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of arbitrary sizes, including prime sizes. (The other algorithm for FFTs of prime sizes, Rader&#x27;s algorithm, also works by rewriting the DFT as a convolution.) It was conceived in 1968 by Leo Bluestein. Bluestein&#x27;s algorithm can be used to compute more general transforms than the DFT, based on the (unilateral) z-transform (Rabiner &quot;et al.&quot;, 1969).

Recall that the DFT is defined by the formula

:formula_4

If we replace the product &quot;nk&quot; in the exponent by the identity

:formula_5

we thus obtain:

:formula_6

This summation is precisely a convolution of the two sequences &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; and &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; defined by:

:formula_7

:formula_8

with the output of the convolution multiplied by &quot;N&quot; phase factors &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;*. That is:

:formula_9

This convolution, in turn, can be performed with a pair of FFTs (plus the pre-computed FFT of complex chirp &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;) via the convolution theorem. The key point is that these FFTs are not of the same length &quot;N&quot;: such a convolution can be computed exactly from FFTs only by zero-padding it to a length greater than or equal to 2&quot;N&quot;–1. In particular, one can pad to a power of two or some other highly composite size, for which the FFT can be efficiently performed by e.g. the Cooley–Tukey algorithm in O(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;) time. Thus, Bluestein&#x27;s algorithm provides an O(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;) way to compute prime-size DFTs, albeit several times slower than the Cooley–Tukey algorithm for composite sizes.

The use of zero-padding for the convolution in Bluestein&#x27;s algorithm deserves some additional comment. Suppose we zero-pad to a length &quot;M&quot; ≥ 2&quot;N&quot;–1. This means that &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; is extended to an array &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; of length &quot;M&quot;, where &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; for 0 ≤ &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;N&quot; and &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 0 otherwise—the usual meaning of &quot;zero-padding&quot;. However, because of the &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;–&quot;n&quot; term in the convolution, both positive and &quot;negative&quot; values of &quot;n&quot; are required for &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; (noting that &quot;b&quot;–&quot;n&quot; = &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;). The periodic boundaries implied by the DFT of the zero-padded array mean that –&quot;n&quot; is equivalent to &quot;M&quot;–&quot;n&quot;. Thus, &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; is extended to an array &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; of length &quot;M&quot;, where &quot;B&quot;0 = &quot;b&quot;0, &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;B&quot;&quot;M&quot;–&quot;n&quot; = &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; for 0 &lt; &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;N&quot;, and &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 0 otherwise. &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are then FFTed, multiplied pointwise, and inverse FFTed to obtain the convolution of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, according to the usual convolution theorem.

Let us also be more precise about what type of convolution is required in Bluestein&#x27;s algorithm for the DFT. If the sequence &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; were periodic in &quot;n&quot; with period &quot;N&quot;, then it would be a cyclic convolution of length &quot;N&quot;, and the zero-padding would be for computational convenience only. However, this is not generally the case:

:formula_10

Therefore, for &quot;N&quot; even the convolution is cyclic, but in this case &quot;N&quot; is composite and one would normally use a more efficient FFT algorithm such as Cooley–Tukey. For &quot;N&quot; odd, however, then &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; is antiperiodic and we technically have a negacyclic convolution of length &quot;N&quot;. Such distinctions disappear when one zero-pads &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; to a length of at least 2&quot;N&quot;−1 as described above, however. It is perhaps easiest, therefore, to think of it as a subset of the outputs of a simple linear convolution (i.e. no conceptual &quot;extensions&quot; of the data, periodic or otherwise).

== z-transforms ==

Bluestein&#x27;s algorithm can also be used to compute a more general transform based on the (unilateral) z-transform (Rabiner &quot;et al.&quot;, 1969). In particular, it can compute any transform of the form:

:formula_11

for an &quot;arbitrary&quot; complex number &quot;z&quot; and for &quot;differing&quot; numbers &quot;N&quot; and &quot;M&quot; of inputs and outputs. Given Bluestein&#x27;s algorithm, such a transform can be used, for example, to obtain a more finely spaced interpolation of some portion of the spectrum (although the frequency resolution is still limited by the total sampling time, similar to a Zoom FFT), enhance arbitrary poles in transfer-function analyses, etc.

The algorithm was dubbed the &quot;chirp&quot; z-transform algorithm because, for the Fourier-transform case (|&quot;z&quot;| = 1), the sequence &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; from above is a complex sinusoid of linearly increasing frequency, which is called a (linear) chirp in radar systems.

<text>In chemistry, a leaving group is defined by the IUPAC as an atom or group of atoms that detaches from the main or residual part of a substrate during a reaction or elementary step of a reaction. However, in common usage, the term is often limited to a fragment that departs with a pair of electrons in heterolytic bond cleavage. In this usage, a &quot;leaving group&quot; is a less formal but more commonly used synonym of the term &quot;nucleofuge&quot;. In this context, leaving groups are generally anions or neutral species, departing from neutral or cationic substrates, respectively, though in rare cases, cations leaving from a dicationic substrate are also known.

A species&#x27; ability to serve as a leaving group depends on its ability to stabilize the additional electron density that results from bond heterolysis. Common anionic leaving groups are halides such as and , and sulfonate esters such as tosylate (), while water (), alcohols (), and amines () are common neutral leaving groups.

In the broader IUPAC definition, the term also includes groups that depart &quot;without&quot; an electron pair in a heterolytic cleavage (groups specifically known as an &quot;electrofuges&quot;), like or , which commonly depart in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Similarly, species of high thermodynamic stability like nitrogen () or carbon dioxide () commonly act as leaving groups in homolytic bond cleavage reactions of radical species. A relatively uncommon term that serves as the antonym of leaving group is entering group (i.e., a species that reacts with and forms a bond with a substrate or a substrate-derived intermediate).

In this article, the discussions below mainly pertain to leaving groups that act as nucleofuges. 
==Leaving group ability==
The physical manifestation of leaving group ability is the rate at which a reaction takes place. Good leaving groups give fast reactions. By transition state theory, this implies that reactions involving good leaving groups have low activation barriers leading to relatively stable transition states.

It is helpful to consider the concept of leaving group ability in the case of the first step of an SN1/E1 reaction with an anionic leaving group (ionization), while keeping in mind that this concept can be generalized to all reactions that involve leaving groups. Because the leaving group bears a larger negative charge in the transition state (and products) than in the starting material, a good leaving group must be able to stabilize this negative charge, i.e. form stable anions. A good measure of anion stability is the p&quot;K&quot;a of an anion&#x27;s conjugate acid (p&quot;K&quot;aH), and leaving group ability indeed generally follows this trend, with a lower p&quot;K&quot;aH correlating well with better leaving group ability.

The correlation between p&quot;K&quot;aH and leaving group ability, however, is not perfect. Leaving group ability represents the difference in energy between starting materials and a transition state (Δ&quot;G&quot;‡) and differences in leaving group ability are reflected in changes in this quantity (ΔΔ&quot;G&quot;‡). The p&quot;K&quot;aH, however, represents the difference in energy between starting materials and products (Δ&quot;G°&quot;) with differences in acidity reflected in changes in this quantity (ΔΔ&quot;G°&quot;). The ability to correlate these energy differences is justified by the Hammond postulate and the Bell–Evans–Polanyi principle. Also, the starting materials in these cases are different. In the case of the acid dissociation constant, the &quot;leaving group&quot; is bound to a proton in the starting material, while in the case of leaving group ability, the leaving group is bound to (usually) carbon. It is with these important caveats in mind that one must consider p&quot;K&quot;aH to be reflective of leaving group ability. Nevertheless, one can generally examine acid dissociation constants to qualitatively predict or rationalize rate or reactivity trends relating to variation of the leaving group. Consistent with this picture, strong bases such as and tend to make poor leaving groups, due their inability to stabilize a negative charge.

What constitutes a reasonable leaving group is dependent on context. For SN2 reactions, typical synthetically useful leaving groups include , , and . Substrates containing phosphate and carboxylate leaving groups are more likely to react by competitive addition-elimination, while sulfonium and ammonium salts generally form ylides or undergo E2 elimination when possible. With reference to the table above, phenoxides () constitute the lower limit for what is feasible as SN2 leaving groups: very strong nucleophiles like or have been used to demethylate anisole derivatives through SN2 displacement at the methyl group. Hydroxide, alkoxides, amides, hydride, and alkyl anions do not serve as leaving groups in SN2 reactions.

On the other hand, when anionic or dianionic tetrahedral intermediates collapse, the high electron density of the neighboring heteroatom facilitates the expulsion of a leaving group. Thus, in the case of ester and amide hydrolysis under basic conditions, alkoxides and amides are commonly proposed as leaving groups. For the same reason, E1cb reactions involving hydroxide as a leaving group are not uncommon (e.g., in the aldol condensation). It is exceedingly rare for groups such as (hydrides), (alkyl anions, R = alkyl or H), or (aryl anions, Ar = aryl) to depart with a pair of electrons because of the high energy of these species. The Chichibabin reaction provides an example of hydride as a leaving group, while the Wolff-Kishner reaction and Haller-Bauer reaction feature unstabilized carbanion leaving groups.

==Contextual differences in leaving group ability==
It is important to note that the list given above is qualitative and describes &quot;trends&quot;. The ability of a group to leave is contextual. For example, in SNAr reactions, the rate is generally increased when the leaving group is fluoride relative to the other halogens. This effect is due to the fact that the highest energy transition state for this two step addition-elimination process occurs in the first step, where fluoride&#x27;s greater electron withdrawing capability relative to the other halides stabilizes the developing negative charge on the aromatic ring. The departure of the leaving group takes place quickly from this high energy Meisenheimer complex, and since the departure is not involved in the rate limiting step, it does not affect the overall rate of the reaction. This effect is general to conjugate base eliminations.

Even when the departure of the leaving group is involved in the rate limiting step of a reaction there can still exist contextual differences that can change the order of leaving group ability. In Friedel-Crafts alkylations, the normal halogen leaving group order is reversed so that the rate of the reaction follows RF &gt; RCl &gt; RBr &gt; RI. This effect is due to their greater ability to complex the Lewis acid catalyst, and the actual group that leaves is an &quot;ate&quot; complex between the Lewis acid and the departing leaving group. This situation is broadly defined as leaving group activation.

There can still exist contextual differences in leaving group ability in the purest form, that is when the actual group that leaves is not affected by the reaction conditions (by protonation or Lewis acid complexation) &quot;and&quot; the departure of the leaving group occurs in the rate determining step. In the situation where other variables are held constant (nature of the alkyl electrophile, solvent, etc.), a change in nucleophile can lead to a change in the order of reactivity for leaving groups. In the case below, tosylate is the best leaving group when ethoxide is the nucleophile, but iodide and even bromide become better leaving groups in the case of the thiolate nucleophile.

==Activation==
It is common in E1 and SN1 reactions for a poor leaving group to be transformed into a good one by protonation or complexation with a Lewis acid. Thus, it is by protonation before departure that a molecule can formally lose such poor leaving groups as hydroxide.

The same principle is at work in the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Here, a strong Lewis acid is required to generate either a carbocation from an alkyl halide in the Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction or an acylium ion from an acyl halide.

In the vast majority of cases, reactions that involve leaving group activation generate a cation in a separate step, before either nucleophilic attack or elimination. For example, SN1 and E1 reactions may involve an activation step, whereas SN2 and E2 reactions generally do not.

==In conjugate base eliminations==
The requirement for a good leaving group is relaxed in conjugate base elimination reactions. These reactions include loss of a leaving group in the β position of an enolate as well as the regeneration of a carbonyl group from the tetrahedral intermediate in nucleophilic acyl substitution. Under forcing conditions, even amides can be made to undergo basic hydrolysis, a process that involves the expulsion of an extremely poor leaving group, R2N−. Even more dramatic, decarboxylation of benzoate anions can occur by heating with copper or Cu2O, involving the loss of an aryl anion. This reaction is facilitated by the fact that the leaving group is most likely an arylcopper compound rather than the much more basic alkali metal salt.

This dramatic departure from normal leaving group requirements occurs mostly in the realm of C=O double bond formation where formation of the very strong C=O double bond can drive otherwise unfavorable reactions forward. The requirement for a good leaving group is still relaxed in the case of C=C bond formation &quot;via&quot; E1cB mechanisms, but because of the relative weakness of the C=C double bond, the reaction still exhibits some leaving group sensitivity. Notably, changing the leaving group&#x27;s identity (and willingness to leave) can change the nature of the mechanism in elimination reactions. With poor leaving groups, the E1cB mechanism is favored, but as the leaving group&#x27;s ability changes, the reaction shifts from having a rate determining loss of leaving group from carbanionic intermediate B &quot;via&quot; TS BC&quot;‡ through having a rate determining deprotonation step &quot;via&quot; TS AB&quot;‡ (not pictured) to a concerted E2 elimination. In the latter situation, the leaving group X has become good enough that the former transition state connecting intermediates B and C has become lower in energy than B, which is no longer a stationary point on the potential energy surface for the reaction. Because only one transition state connects starting material A and product C, the reaction is now concerted (albeit very asynchronous in the pictured case) due to the increase in leaving group ability of X.

==&quot;Super&quot; and &quot;hyper&quot; leaving groups==
The prototypical super leaving group is triflate, and the term has come to mean any leaving group of comparable ability. Compounds where loss of a super leaving group can generate a stable carbocation are usually highly reactive and unstable. Thus, the most commonly encountered organic triflates are methyl triflate and alkenyl or aryl triflates, all of which cannot form stable carbocations on ionization, rendering them relatively stable. It has been noted that steroidal alkyl nonaflates (another super leaving group) generated from alcohols and perfluorobutanesulfonyl fluoride were not isolable as such but immediately formed the products of either elimination or substitution by fluoride generated by the reagent. Mixed acyl-trifluoromethanesulfonyl anhydrides smoothly undergo Friedel-Crafts acylation without a catalyst, unlike the corresponding acyl halides, which require a strong Lewis acid. Methyl triflate, however, does not participate in Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions with electron-neutral aromatic rings.

Beyond super leaving groups in reactivity lie the &quot;hyper&quot; leaving groups. Prominent among these are λ3-iodanes, which include diaryl iodonium salts, and other halonium ions. In one study, a quantitative comparison of these and other leaving groups was conducted. Relative to chloride (krel = 1), reactivities increased in the order bromide (krel = 14), iodide (krel = 91), tosylate (krel = 3.7), triflate (krel = 1.4), phenyliodonium tetrafluoroborate (, krel = 1.2). Along with the criterion that a hyper leaving group be a stronger leaving group than triflate is the necessity that the leaving group undergo reductive elimination. In the case of halonium ions this involves reduction from a trivalent halonium to a monovalent halide coupled with the release of an anionic fragment. Part of the exceptional reactivity of compounds of hyper leaving groups has been ascribed to the entropic favorability of having one molecule split into three.

Dialkyl halonium ions have also been isolated and characterized for simple alkyl groups. These compounds, despite their extreme reactivity towards nucleophiles, can be obtained pure in the solid state with very weakly nucleophilic counterions such as and . The strongly electrophilic nature of these compounds engendered by their attachment to extremely labile (R = alkyl, X = Cl, Br, I) leaving groups is illustrated by their propensity to alkylate very weak nucleophiles. Heating neat samples of under reduced pressure resulted in methylation of the very poorly nucleophilic carborane anion with concomitant expulsion of the leaving group. Dialkyl halonium hexafluoroantimonate salts alkylate excess alkyl halides to give exchanged products. Their strongly electrophilic nature, along with the instability of primary carbocations generated from ionization of their alkyl groups, points to their possible involvement in Friedel-Crafts alkylation chemistry. The order of increasing lability of these leaving groups is .

<text>Richard M. Jones, born Richard Marigny Jones (sometimes written Richard Mariney Jones), (June 13, 1892 – December 8, 1945) was an American jazz pianist, composer, band leader, and record producer. Numerous songs bear his name as author, including &quot;Trouble in Mind&quot;.

He was born in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, United States. Jones grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana. Jones suffered from a stiff leg and walked with a limp; fellow musicians gave him the nickname &quot;Richard My Knee Jones&quot; as a pun on his middle name. In his youth he played alto horn in brass bands. His main instrument, however, became the piano. By 1908, he was playing in Storyville, the red-light district of New Orleans. A few years later, he often led a small band which sometimes included Joe Oliver. Jones also worked in the bands of John Robichaux, Armand J. Piron, and Papa Celestin.

In 1918, Jones moved to Chicago, Illinois. He worked as Chicago manager for publisher and pianist Clarence Williams. Jones began recording in 1923, making gramophone records as a piano soloist, accompanist to vocalists, and with his bands The Jazz Wizards and The Chicago Cosmopolitans. He recorded for Gennett, OKeh, Victor, and Paramount Records in the 1920s. He also worked for OKeh Records as Chicago supervisor of the company&#x27;s &quot;Race&quot; (African-American) Records for most of the decade. During this period he was the producer of the influential Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings led by cornetist (later trumpeter) Louis Armstrong. In the 1930s, Jones performed a similar management role for Decca.

Richard M. Jones worked for Mercury Records until his death in December 1945 in Chicago, at the age of 53.

<doc id="241458" wikidata="Q49090" url="?curid=241458" title="Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)">
<text>Charles McArthur Ghankay Taylor (born 28 January 1948) is a Liberian former politician and convicted war criminal who served as the 22nd president of Liberia from 2 August 1997 until his resignation on 11 August 2003 as a result of the Second Liberian Civil War and growing international pressure.

Born in Arthington, Montserrado County, Liberia, Taylor earned a degree at Bentley College in the United States before returning to Liberia to work in the government of Samuel Doe. After being removed for embezzlement and imprisoned by President Doe, Taylor escaped prison in 1989. He eventually arrived in Libya, where he was trained as a guerrilla fighter. He returned to Liberia in 1989 as the head of a Libyan-backed rebel group, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, to overthrow the Doe government, initiating the First Liberian Civil War (1989–1996). Following Doe&#x27;s execution, Taylor gained control of a large portion of the country and became one of the most prominent warlords in Africa. His forces, along with those of other rival warlords such as ULIMO were notorious for committing widespread human rights abuses and atrocities during the civil war. Following a peace deal that ended the war, Taylor was elected president in the 1997 general election as a member of the National Patriotic Party (NPP).

During his term of office, Taylor was accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity as a result of his support for the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebel group in the Sierra Leone Civil War (1991–2002). Domestically, Taylor attempted to consolidate power through dictatorial means such as by purging the military and committing violence against his political rivals, including an assassination attempt of former ULIMO commander Roosevelt Johnson, leading to violent clashes in Monrovia in 1996. As a result, opposition to his government grew, culminating in the outbreak of the Second Liberian Civil War in 1999. By 2003, Taylor had lost control of much of the countryside and was formally indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone. That year, he resigned, as a result of growing international pressure; he went into exile in Nigeria. In 2006, the newly elected President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, formally requested his extradition. He was detained by UN authorities in Sierra Leone and then at the Penitentiary Institution Haaglanden in The Hague, awaiting trial by the Special Court. He was found guilty in April 2012 of all eleven charges levied by the Special Court, including terror, murder and rape.

In May 2012, Taylor was sentenced to 50 years in prison. Reading the sentencing statement, Presiding Judge Richard Lussick said: &quot;The accused has been found responsible for aiding and abetting as well as planning some of the most heinous and brutal crimes in recorded human history.&quot;

==Early life==
Taylor was born in Arthington, a town near the capital of Monrovia, Liberia, on 28 January 1948, to Nelson and Yassa Zoe (Louise) Taylor. He attended The Newman School in his early years. He took the name &quot;Ghankay&quot; later on, possibly to please and gain favor with indigenous Liberians. His mother was a member of the Gola ethnic group, part of the 95% of the people who are indigenous to Liberia. According to most reports, his father was an Americo-Liberian who worked as a teacher, sharecropper, lawyer and judge.

In 1977, Taylor earned a degree at Bentley College in Waltham, Massachusetts, United States.

==Government, imprisonment and escape==
Taylor supported the 1980 Liberian coup d&#x27;état led by Samuel Doe, which resulted in the murder of President William Tolbert and seizure of power by Doe, who established the People&#x27;s Redemption Council. Taylor was appointed to the position of Director General of the General Services Agency (GSA), a position that left him in charge of purchasing for the Liberian government. He was fired in May 1983 for embezzling an estimated $1,000,000 (~$ in ) and sending the funds to another bank account.

Taylor fled to the United States but was arrested on 21 May 1984 by two US Deputy Marshals in Somerville, Massachusetts, on a warrant for extradition to face charges of embezzling $1 million (~$ in ) of government funds while he was the GSA boss. Taylor fought extradition with the help of a legal team led by former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark. His lawyers&#x27; primary arguments before US District Magistrate Robert J. DeGiacomo stated that his alleged acts of lawbreaking in Liberia were political rather than criminal in nature and that the extradition treaty between the two republics had lapsed. Assistant United States Attorney Richard G. Stearns argued that Liberia wished to charge Taylor with theft in office, rather than with political crimes. Stearns&#x27; arguments were reinforced by Liberian Justice Minister Jenkins Scott, who flew to the United States to testify at the proceedings. Taylor was detained in the Plymouth County Correctional Facility.

On 15 September 1985, Taylor and four other inmates escaped from the jail. Two days later, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that they sawed through a bar covering a window in a dormitory room, after which they lowered themselves on knotted sheets and escaped into nearby woods by climbing a fence. Shortly thereafter, Taylor and two other escapees were met at nearby Jordan Hospital by Taylor&#x27;s wife, Enid, and Taylor&#x27;s sister-in-law, Lucia Holmes Toweh. They drove a getaway car to Staten Island in New York, where Taylor disappeared. All four of Taylor&#x27;s fellow escapees, as well as Enid and Toweh, were later apprehended.

In July 2009, Taylor claimed at his trial that US CIA agents had helped him escape from the maximum security prison in Boston in 1985. This was during his trial by the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone in The Hague. The US Defense Intelligence Agency confirmed that Taylor first started working with US intelligence in the 1980s but refused to give details of his role or US actions, citing national security.

===Civil war===
Taylor escaped the United States without issue. He then resurfaced in Libya where he took part in militia training under Muammar Gaddafi, becoming Gaddafi&#x27;s protégé. He later left Libya and travelled to the Ivory Coast, where he founded the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL).

In December 1989, Taylor launched a Gaddafi-funded armed uprising from the Ivory Coast into Liberia to overthrow the Doe regime, leading to the First Liberian Civil War. By 1990, his forces controlled most of the country. That same year, Prince Johnson, a senior commander of Taylor&#x27;s NPFL, broke away and formed the Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL).

In September 1990, Johnson captured Monrovia, depriving Taylor of outright victory. Johnson and his forces captured and tortured Doe to death, instigating a violent political fragmentation of the country. The civil war turned into an ethnic conflict, with seven factions among indigenous peoples and the Americo-Liberians fighting for control of Liberia&#x27;s resources (especially iron ore, diamonds, timber, and rubber).

Amos Sawyer alleges that Taylor&#x27;s aims extended beyond Liberia—that he wanted to re-establish the country as a regional power player. Taylor&#x27;s ambitions, which were held from the civil war period into his presidency, not only resulted in the domestic Liberian conflict, they also triggered regional instability which manifested itself in the forms of the Sierra Leone Civil War and unrest in the forest region of Guinea.

==Presidency==

After the official end of the civil war in 1996, Taylor ran for president in the 1997 general election. He campaigned on the notorious slogan &quot;He killed my ma, he killed my pa, but I will vote for him.&quot;

The elections were overseen by the United Nations&#x27; peacekeeping mission, United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia, along with a contingent from the Economic Community of West African States. Taylor won the election in a landslide, garnering 75 percent of the vote. Although the election was generally regarded as free and fair by international observers, Taylor had a significant advantage from the outset. During the civil war, he seized virtually all of the country&#x27;s radio stations and used his control over the Liberian airwaves to spread propaganda and bolster his image. Additionally, there was widespread fear in the country that Taylor would resume the war if he lost.

During his time in office, Taylor cut the size of the Armed Forces of Liberia, dismissing 2,400–2,600 former personnel, many of whom were ethnic Krahn brought in by former President Doe to give advantage to his people. In 1998, Taylor attempted to murder one of his political opponents, the former warlord Roosevelt Johnson, causing clashes in Monrovia, during and after which hundreds of Krahn were massacred and hundreds more fled Liberia. This event was one of the factors that led to the outbreak of the Second Liberian Civil War.

In 2003, members of the Krahn tribe founded a rebel group, the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), opposing Taylor. The group disbanded as part of the peace agreement at the end of the second civil war. In its place, Taylor installed the Anti-Terrorist Unit, the Special Operations Division of the Liberian National Police (LNP), which he used as his private army.

During his presidency, Taylor was alleged to have been involved directly in the Sierra Leone Civil War. He was accused of aiding the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) through weapon sales in exchange for blood diamonds. Due to a UN embargo against arms sales to Liberia at the time, these weapons were largely purchased on the black market through arms smugglers such as Viktor Bout. Taylor was charged with aiding and abetting RUF atrocities against civilians, which left many thousands dead or mutilated, with unknown numbers of people abducted and tortured. He was also accused of assisting the RUF in the recruitment of child soldiers. In addition to aiding the RUF in these acts, Taylor reportedly personally directed RUF operations in Sierra Leone.

Taylor obtained spiritual and other advice from the evangelist Kilari Anand Paul. As president, he was known for his flamboyant style. Upon being charged by the UN of being a gunrunner and diamond smuggler during his presidency, Taylor appeared in all-white robes and begged God for forgiveness, while denying the charges. He was reported to have said that &quot;Jesus Christ was accused of being a murderer in his time.&quot;

During the last four years of Taylor&#x27;s presidency, he is believed to have stolen and diverted nearly $100 million, amounting to roughly half of total government revenue.

===Rebellion and indictment===
In 1999, a rebellion against Taylor began in northern Liberia, led by a group calling itself Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD). This group was frequently accused of atrocities, and is thought to have been backed by the government of neighboring Guinea. This uprising signaled the beginning of the Second Liberian Civil War.

By early 2003, LURD had gained control of northern Liberia. That year, a second Ivorian-backed rebel group, Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), emerged in southern Liberia and achieved rapid success. By the summer, Taylor&#x27;s government controlled only about a third of Liberia: Monrovia and the central part of the country. More than one-third of the total population lived in this area.

On 7 March 2003, the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) issued a sealed indictment for Taylor. Earlier that year, Liberian forces had killed Sam Bockarie, a leading member of the RUF in Sierra Leone, in a shootout under Taylor&#x27;s orders. Some have claimed that Taylor ordered Bockarie killed to prevent the leader from testifying against him at the SCSL.

In June 2003, Alan White, the Prosecutor to the Special Court unsealed the indictment and announced publicly that Taylor was charged with war crimes. The indictment asserted that Taylor created and backed the RUF rebels in Sierra Leone, who were accused of a range of atrocities, including the use of child soldiers. The Prosecutor also said that Taylor&#x27;s administration had harbored members of Al-Qaeda sought in connection with the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

The indictment was unsealed during Taylor&#x27;s official visit to Ghana, where he was participating in peace talks with MODEL and LURD officials. As result, the possibility arose that Taylor might be arrested by Ghanaian authorities; in response, Taylor&#x27;s chief bodyguard and military commander Benjamin Yeaten threatened to execute Ghanaians who lived in Liberia, deterring Ghana&#x27;s government from taking action. With the backing of South African president Thabo Mbeki and against the urging of Sierra Leone president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, Ghana consequently declined to detain Taylor, who returned to Monrovia.

===Resignation===
During Taylor&#x27;s absence for the peace talks in Ghana, the U.S. government was alleged to have urged Vice President Moses Blah to seize power. Upon his return, Taylor briefly dismissed Blah from his post, only to reinstate him a few days later.

In July 2003, LURD initiated a siege of Monrovia, and several bloody battles were fought as Taylor&#x27;s forces halted rebel attempts to capture the city. The pressure on Taylor increased as U.S. President George W. Bush twice that month stated that Taylor &quot;must leave Liberia&quot;. On 9 July, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo offered Taylor exile in his country on the condition that Taylor stay out of Liberian politics.

Taylor insisted that he would resign only if U.S. peacekeeping troops were deployed to Liberia. Bush publicly called upon Taylor to resign and leave the country in order for any American involvement to be considered. Meanwhile, several African states, in particular the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) under the leadership of Nigeria, sent troops under the banner of ECOMIL to Liberia.

Logistical support was provided by a California company called PAE Government Services Inc., which was given a $10 million contract by the U.S. State Department. On 6 August, a 32-member U.S. military assessment team was deployed as a liaison with the ECOWAS troops, landing from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, commanded by Colonel A.P. Frick, from three U.S. Navy amphibious ships waiting off the Liberian coast.

On 10 August, Taylor appeared on national television to announce that he would resign the following day and hand power to Vice President Blah. He harshly criticized the United States in his farewell address, saying that the Bush administration&#x27;s insistence that he leave the country would hurt Liberia. On 11 August, Taylor resigned, with Blah serving as president until a transitional government was established on 14 October. Ghanaian President John Kufuor, South African President Thabo Mbeki, and Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, all representing African regional councils, were present at his announcement. The U.S. brought Joint Task Force Liberia&#x27;s Amphibious Ready Group of three warships with 2,300 Marines into view of the coast. Taylor flew to Nigeria, where the Nigerian government provided houses for him and his entourage in Calabar.

==Exile==
In November 2003, the United States Congress passed a bill that included a reward offer of two million dollars for Taylor&#x27;s capture. While the peace agreement had guaranteed Taylor safe exile in Nigeria, it also required that he refrain from influencing Liberian politics. His critics said he disregarded this prohibition. On 4 December, Interpol issued a red notice regarding Taylor, suggesting that countries had a duty to arrest him. Taylor was placed on Interpol&#x27;s Most Wanted list, declaring him wanted for crimes against humanity and breaches of the 1949 Geneva Convention, and noting that he should be considered dangerous. Nigeria stated it would not submit to Interpol&#x27;s demands, agreeing to deliver Taylor to Liberia only in the event that the President of Liberia requested his return.

On 17 March 2006, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the newly elected President of Liberia, submitted an official request to Nigeria for Taylor&#x27;s extradition. This request was granted on 25 March, whereby Nigeria agreed to release Taylor to stand trial in the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL). Nigeria agreed only to release Taylor and not to extradite him, as no extradition treaty existed between the two countries.

===Disappearance and arrest===
Three days after Nigeria announced its intent to transfer Taylor to Liberia, the leader disappeared from the seaside villa where he had been living in exile. A week before that, Nigerian authorities had taken the unusual step of allowing local press to accompany census takers into Taylor&#x27;s Calabar compound.

Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo was scheduled to meet with President Bush less than 48 hours after Taylor was reported missing. Speculation ensued that Bush would refuse to meet with Obasanjo if Taylor were not apprehended. Less than 12 hours prior to the scheduled meeting between the two heads of state, Taylor was reported apprehended en route to Liberia.

On 29 March, Taylor tried to cross the border into Cameroon through the border town of Gamboru in northeastern Nigeria. His Range Rover with Nigerian diplomatic plates was stopped by border guards, and Taylor&#x27;s identity was eventually established.

Upon his arrival at Roberts International Airport in Harbel, Liberia, Taylor was arrested and handcuffed by LNP officers, who immediately transferred responsibility for the custody of Taylor to the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). Irish UNMIL soldiers escorted Taylor aboard a UN helicopter to Freetown, Sierra Leone, where he was delivered to the SCSL.

==Trial==

The SCSL prosecutor originally indicted Taylor on 3 March 2003 on 17 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the conflict in Sierra Leone. On 16 March 2006, a SCSL judge gave leave to amend the indictment against Taylor. Under the amended indictment, Taylor was charged with 11 counts. At Taylor&#x27;s initial appearance before the court on 3 April 2006, he entered a plea of not guilty.

In early June 2006, the decision on whether to hold Taylor&#x27;s trial in Freetown or in Leidschendam had not yet been made by the new SCSL president, George Gelaga King. King&#x27;s predecessor had pushed for the trial to be held abroad because of fear that a local trial would be politically destabilizing in an area where Taylor still had influence. The Appeals Chamber of the Special Court dismissed a motion by Taylor&#x27;s defence team, who argued that their client could not get a fair trial there and also wanted the Special Court to withdraw the request to move the trial to Leidschendam.

On 15 June 2006, the British government agreed to jail Taylor in the United Kingdom in the event he was convicted by the SCSL. This fulfilled a condition laid down by the Dutch government, which had stated it was willing to host the trial but would not jail him if convicted. British Foreign Minister Margaret Beckett stated that new legislation would be required to accommodate this arrangement. This legislation came in the form of the International Tribunals (Sierra Leone) Act 2007. While awaiting his extradition to the Netherlands, Taylor was held in a UN jail in Freetown.

On 16 June 2006, the United Nations Security Council agreed unanimously to allow Taylor to be sent to Leidschendam for trial; on 20 June 2006, Taylor was extradited and flown to Rotterdam Airport in the Netherlands. He was taken into custody and held in the detention centre of the International Criminal Court, located in the Scheveningen section of The Hague. The Association for the Legal Defence of Charles G. Taylor was established in June 2006 to assist in his legal defence.

When Taylor&#x27;s trial opened on 4 June 2007, Taylor boycotted the proceeding and was not present. Through a letter that was read by his attorney to the court, he justified his absence by alleging that at that moment he was not ensured a fair and impartial trial.

On 20 August 2007, Taylor&#x27;s defence, now led by Courtenay Griffiths, obtained a postponement of the trial until 7 January 2008. During the trial, the chief prosecutor alleged that a key insider witness who testified against Taylor went into hiding after being threatened for giving evidence against Taylor. Furthermore, Joseph &quot;Zigzag&quot; Marzah, a former military commander, testified that Charles Taylor celebrated his new-found status during the civil war by ordering human sacrifice, including the killings of Taylor&#x27;s opponents and allies that were perceived to have betrayed Taylor, and by having a pregnant woman buried alive in sand. Marzah also accused Taylor of forcing cannibalism on his soldiers to terrorize their enemies.

In January 2009, the prosecution finished presenting its evidence against Taylor and closed its case on 27 February 2009. On 4 May 2009, a defence motion for a judgment of acquittal was dismissed, and arguments for Taylor&#x27;s defence began in July 2009. Taylor testified in his own defence from July through November 2009. The defence rested its case on 12 November 2010, with closing arguments set for early February 2011.

On 8 February 2011, the trial court ruled in a 2–1 decision that it would not accept Taylor&#x27;s trial summary, as the summary had not been submitted by the 14 January deadline. In response, Taylor and his counsel boycotted the trial and refused an order by the court to begin closing arguments. This boycott came soon after the 2010 leak of American diplomatic cables, in which the United States discussed the possibility of extraditing Taylor for prosecution in the United States in the event of his acquittal by the SCSL. Taylor&#x27;s counsel cited the leaked cable and the court&#x27;s decision as evidence of an international conspiracy against Taylor.

On 3 March, the appeals court of the SCSL overturned the trial court&#x27;s decision, ruling that as the trial court had not established that Taylor had been counseled by the court and personally indicated his intent to waive his right to a trial summary, Taylor&#x27;s due process rights would be violated by preventing him from submitting a trial summary. The appeals court ordered the trial court to accept the summary and set a date for the beginning of closing arguments. On 11 March, the closing arguments ended, and it was announced that the court would begin the process to reach a verdict.

===Verdict===
The verdict was announced in Leidschendam on 26 April 2012. The SCSL unanimously ruled that he was guilty of all 11 counts of &quot;aiding and abetting&quot; war crimes and crimes against humanity, making him the first (former) head of state to be convicted by an international tribunal since Karl Dönitz at the Nuremberg Trials. Taylor was charged with:
*Explanation of type of crime:
* CAH: Crimes against humanity
* WC: Violation of Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions and of Additional Protocol II (war crimes)
* VIHL: Other serious violation of international humanitarian law

At his trial, Taylor claimed that he was a victim, denied the charges and compared his actions of torture and crimes against humanity to the actions of George W. Bush in the War on Terror. Sentencing hearings commenced on 3 May and were announced on 30 May. Taylor was sentenced to 50 years in prison. He was about 64 years of age at the time of sentencing. 

Sierra Leone&#x27;s government described the sentence as &quot;a step forward as justice has been done, though the magnitude of the sentence is not commensurate with the atrocities committed&quot;.

Taylor appealed against the verdict, but on 26 September 2013, Appeals Chamber of the Special Court confirmed his guilt and the penalty of 50 years in prison.

===Imprisonment===
On 15 October 2013, Taylor was transferred to British custody, and began serving his sentence at HM Prison Frankland in County Durham, England. Taylor&#x27;s attorneys filed a motion to have him transferred to a prison in Rwanda, but in March 2015, the motion was denied and he was ordered to continue serving his sentence in the United Kingdom. In January 2017, it was found that he had been making phone calls from the prison to provide guidance to the National Patriotic Party and threaten some of his enemies.

In October 2021, Taylor filed a complaint against the Liberian government for &quot;non-payment of his retirement&quot;. This complaint was lodged with the Court of Justice of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

==Personal life==
In 1997, Taylor married Jewel Taylor, with whom he has one son. She filed for divorce in 2005, citing her husband&#x27;s exile in Nigeria and the difficulty of visiting him due to a UN travel ban on her. The divorce was granted in 2006. From January, 2018 to January 22, 2024, Jewel Taylor served as Vice President of Liberia with George Manneh Weah.

Phillip Taylor, Taylor&#x27;s son with Jewel, remained in Liberia following his father&#x27;s extradition to the SCSL. He was arrested by Liberian police officials on 5 March 2011 and charged with attempted murder in connection with an assault on the son of an immigration officer who had assisted in Charles Taylor&#x27;s extradition; the mother of the victim claimed that Phillip Taylor had sworn vengeance against the immigration officer. He was arrested at Buchanan in Grand Bassa County, allegedly while attempting to cross the border into the Ivory Coast.

Taylor has three children with his second wife Victoria Addison Taylor; the youngest, Charlize, was born in March 2010. In 2014, Victoria was denied a visa to visit her husband while he serves his sentence in the United Kingdom.

Taylor also has another son, a U.S. citizen named Charles McArther Emmanuel, born to his college girlfriend. Emmanuel was arrested in 2006 after entering the United States and was charged with three counts, including participation in torture while serving in the Anti-Terrorist Unit in Liberia during his father&#x27;s presidency. The law that prosecuted Emmanuel was put in place in 1994, before &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; in an attempt to prevent U.S. citizens from committing acts of torture overseas. To date, this is the only prosecuted case. In October 2008, Emmanuel was convicted on all three counts and sentenced to 97 years in prison.

Charles Taylor is also said to have been the husband or partner to Agnes Reeves Taylor. Agnes and Charles met when Taylor was head of the General Services Agency in the mid-1980s during the regime of former President Samuel Kanyon Doe. According to Trial international, Charles Taylor and Agnes Reeves Taylor married in Ghana in 1986. However, according to allafrica.com, the two were never legally married. She is reported to have left Liberia in 1992 before the end of the civil war and settled in the United Kingdom where she was a lecturer at Coventry University. On 2 June 2017, she was arrested in London by the Metropolitan Police and charged with torture on the grounds of her suspected involvement with the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) rebel group, which was led by her ex-husband, during the First Liberian Civil War, from 1989 to 1996. On 6 December 2019 the Central Criminal Court (The Old Bailey) in London decided to dismiss the charges against Agnes Reeves Taylor. The Court&#x27;s decision came after the UK Supreme Court confirmed, in a historic judgment on 13 November 2019, that members of non-state armed groups may be prosecuted for crimes of torture under section 134(1) of the UK Criminal Justice Act 1988, thus legally paving the way for the case against Agnes Reeves Taylor to proceed to trial. However, after rendering its judgment, the UK Supreme Court sent the case back to the Central Criminal Court to consider further evidence from the prosecution&#x27;s expert and apply the legal standard confirmed by the Supreme Court to the facts of the case. In order for a member of a non-state armed group to be prosecuted for torture, the group must have been exercising &quot;governmental functions&quot;. The Central Criminal Court ruled that the evidence presented by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) failed to prove that the NPFL had the requisite authority over the relevant territory at the time the crimes in question were committed. Therefore, the court dismissed the case.

<text>Pandemonium is a 1982 American parody slasher film. It was directed by Alfred Sole and features an ensemble cast including 
Tom Smothers, Eileen Brennan, Phil Hartman, Tab Hunter, Judge Reinhold, Carol Kane, David Lander, Eve Arden, and Paul Reubens.

The film went into production under the working title of &quot;Thursday the 12th&quot;. The film was the last feature in which Eve Arden appeared and also the last feature film Sole directed in his career.

The film is set in Indiana, focusing on a fictional cheerleading camp. The camp closed in 1963, following the murders of several cheerleaders at an affiliated university. Nearly twenty years later, a veteran cheerleader re-opens the camp and ignores warnings about a supposed curse on the camp. The killings soon start again. The killer turns out to be a local celebrity, who never fulfilled his dreams of becoming a cheerleader.

&quot;Pandemonium&quot; was released in theatres on April 2, 1982.

==Plot==
In the fictional town of It Had To Be, Indiana, fullback Blue Grange scores the winning touchdown for It Had To Be University in the 1963 National Championship game. Afterwards, a shunned cheerleader named Bambi is seen fawning over Grange&#x27;s locker before the on-field celebration pours into the locker room. As a group of cheerleaders are cleaning up the field after the game, all five are skewered with a javelin thrown by an unknown assailant. The bizarre murder makes headlines, as does a subsequent murder involving exploding pompons. As a result, the college&#x27;s summer cheerleading camp is closed down. In 1982, the camp reopens with Bambi as the instructor. After arriving on campus, she meets Pepe the maintenance man and his mother Salt. Both warn her against reopening the camp as they believe it to be cursed with death, but Bambi is undeterred.

At a bus station, a young woman named Candy (labeled Victim #1) prepares to board a bus to the cheerleading camp but her religious fanatic mother tries to dissuade her. As they quarrel, red beams of light streak from Candy&#x27;s eyes and levitate her mother into the air. As she hangs suspended, Candy tells her that she just wants to be normal and marches away to catch the bus. Elsewhere, a male cheerleader named Glenn Dandy (Victim #2) says goodbye to his eccentric family before leaving for camp. Next, Mandy (Victim #3) is introduced by her father in a beauty pageant-style interview, revealing her obsession with dental hygiene. Sandy (Victim #4) asks for directions to the camp at a food truck and decides to hitchhike, but insists on getting references from every driver she passes (eventually accepting a ride with then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan). Andy and Randy (Victims #5 and #6 respectively), two lecherous male cheerleaders, are shown smoking marijuana while driving to the camp. The cheerleaders assemble at the camp and are greeted by Bambi.

Meanwhile, a Canadian Mountie named Sgt. Reginald Cooper makes a phone call to Warden June to express his concerns about the new cheerleading camp. He also learns of an escaped convict named Jarrett who murdered his entire family with a hand drill and turned them into bookshelves. Cooper then leaves the station in the care of his ill-tempered assistant Johnson to visit the Indiana State Asylum, where he inquires about another recent escapee named Fletcher, who is shown hitching a ride to the college with Jarrett.

The cheerleaders begin training, unaware that they are being stalked by a mysterious figure on campus. Cooper arrives to meet the cheerleaders and quickly falls in love with Candy, singing a duet with her. Inspired, Glenn dresses in a tuxedo and attempts to woo Mandy, but fails to catch her during a routine practice drill and she injures her ankle. Bambi calls off practice for the day, but while the others go out to eat, a guilty Glenn stays in the gym to continue practicing and is killed when the mysterious figure rigs the trampoline with dynamite. While recovering in her dorm room, Mandy is brushing her teeth with copious amounts of toothpaste when the mystery man bursts through her medicine cabinet and kills her with a hand drill.

Back at the police station, Cooper receives a call from Warden June who tells him that Jarrett has been spotted at a cemetery and museum called Lover&#x27;s Lane. He and Johnson leave to investigate and find the wrecked car Fletcher was driving, and meet Dr. Fuller from the asylum who is looking for Fletcher. Alerted by a scream inside the museum, Cooper and Johnson interrupt Jarrett before he can murder Fletcher. They are shocked to discover that Jarrett and Dr. Fuller are working together in a scheme to create and sell furniture made from their victims bodies, but both deny harming any cheerleaders. Suddenly, Fletcher rises up and drives a butcher knife into Jarrett&#x27;s mechanical arm, electrocuting both of them and Dr. Fuller.

Nevertheless, the slayings continue on campus. Bambi is enjoying a bath of milk and cookies when the killer reappears and drowns her. After a game of strip poker, Randy, Andy, and Sandy are killed in succession, and a panicked Candy discovers all the bodies before being stalked by the killer herself. She flees into the locker room where the killer reveals himself as Blue Grange, who secretly wanted to be a cheerleader instead of a football star and began murdering cheerleaders out of angst. Candy escapes onto the football field and uses her eye beams to run down Grange with a giant statue of himself, killing him. Cooper arrives to sweep Candy onto his horse named Bob and they happily ride off the field together.

==Production==
Alfred Sole had initially been set to direct a horror film for 20th Century Fox titled &quot;Ghouls&quot;. Its plot revolved around suspended animation. However, following the box office disappointment of &quot;Terror Train&quot; as well as a New York Times article on &quot;The Death of Horror Films,&quot; Fox lost interest in the film and attempts to revive it at other studios were met with disinterest.

After &quot;Ghouls&quot; fell apart, producers Doug Chapin and Barry Krost instead offered Sole &quot;Thursday the 12th&quot; which was an original screenplay written by Jaime Klein and Richard Whitley after the two screened an entry of &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and felt it was ridiculous enough to make for a parody. Over time the slasher parody elements were downplayed as the film instead became more of a broad comedy.

The film had initially been set up at Paramount Pictures, but Paramount refused to allow Chapin and Krost their choice of director and the two instead brought the film to United Artists. The film had initially been set to release around Halloween 1981, but was pushed back to a spring release date the following year. This may have been motivated by the Roger Corman produced &quot;Saturday the 14th&quot; which despite starting production after &quot;Thursday the 12th&quot; wrapped, was able to be released in August 1981 thanks to Corman&#x27;s quick turnaround time in producing and releasing films. &quot;Thursday the 12th&quot; was ultimately given the new name &quot;Pandemonium&quot;.

==Reception==
The film earned mostly negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office.

Stephen Hill at &quot;HorrorNews&quot; wrote: &quot;An hour and seventeen minutes has never felt so long... &quot;Pandemonium&quot; feels as though someone who had their sense of humour surgically removed is attempting to ape a Mel Brooks movie by going through all the motions.&quot;

A 1990&#x27;s description of the film in the Canadian edition of TV Guide referenced Tom Smothers role as a Mountie, adding the commentary, &quot;we should sue.&quot;

<doc id="241471" wikidata="Q329127" url="?curid=241471" title="American Pie 2">
<text>American Pie 2 is a 2001 American sex comedy film directed by James B. Rogers and written by Adam Herz and David H. Steinberg from a story by Herz. A sequel to the 1999 comedy film &quot;American Pie&quot;, it is the second film in the &quot;American Pie&quot; series and stars Jason Biggs, Shannon Elizabeth, Alyson Hannigan, Chris Klein, Natasha Lyonne, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Tara Reid, Seann William Scott, Mena Suvari, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and Eugene Levy. The film follows the sexual exploits of five friends – Jim, Kevin, Stifler, Oz, and Finch – and their attempts to have the greatest summer party ever at a summer beach house.

&quot;American Pie 2&quot; was released in the United States on August 10, 2001, and grossed over $145 million in the US and $142 million overseas on a budget of $30 million, making it the highest-grossing film in the franchise at just under $232 million worldwide. The film was followed by &quot;American Wedding&quot; (2003).

==Plot==
Home for the summer after college, Jim Levenstein, Kevin Myers, Chris &quot;Oz&quot; Ostreicher, and Paul Finch attend Steve Stifler&#x27;s party until the police shut it down. Kevin is inspired by his brother to rent a Lake Michigan beach house and throw a massive party to close out the summer.

The group obtains jobs painting houses in order to afford the rent. Jim receives a call from former love interest Nadia who informs him that she plans to visit him. To gain sexual experience, Jim seeks out his prom date, Michelle, who agrees to help him after he is mistaken for a mentally disabled trombone prodigy and makes a fool of himself in front of a band camp concert audience.

The group hosts a small party where Kevin and his ex-girlfriend Vicky awkwardly lie to one another regarding the number of sexual partners they have had at college. Oz attempts to have phone sex with his girlfriend Heather while she is studying abroad in Spain but they are interrupted by Stifler.

While painting a house, the group observes the two female occupants Stifler assumes are lesbians and he enters their home while they are away in order to find proof. Jim and Finch pursue him inside in an attempt to stop him when the women return home and find the trio inside. They tempt the boys with some quid pro quo sex acts. However, when Stifler exposes his genitals after the women request watching the boys give each other handjobs, Finch and Jim leave in disgust.

Jim visits Michelle again to obtain sexual tips and they are nearly caught by a camp director. Stifler brings the group pornography and Jim later accidentally mistakes super glue for lubricant and learns his penis will be &quot;unusable&quot; for a short period of time. Meanwhile, Finch has become involved in the art of Tantra and waits to use his new skills with Stifler&#x27;s mom, who he mistakenly believes has arrived but is disappointed when he learns it is Stifler&#x27;s younger brother.

Nadia unexpectedly arrives early, much to the dismay of Jim as his penis has not fully healed. He and Michelle pretend to be in a relationship. However, she realizes that she has fallen in love with him but stages a mock breakup the night of the party so that Jim is free to hook up with Nadia. As the party begins, Jim realizes that he loves Michelle. Jim interrupts her concert performance and they return to the party together.

Meanwhile, Sherman is seduced by Nadia who is attracted to his geeky persona. Kevin is disappointed to learn Vicky has brought a date and storms off onto the beach. Oz is happy when Heather unexpectedly arrives early. Jim, Oz, and Finch speak to Kevin, who admits he is struggling to move on after high school; but they reassure and convince him to return to the party. The group returns, Kevin apologizes to Vicky, and they all enjoy an evening of partying together. The two &quot;lesbians&quot; arrive to the party and later have a threesome with Stifler.

The next day, the group prepares to leave when a car pulls up; Finch approaches and finds Stifler&#x27;s mom inside. They drive off together and have sex again.

==Production==
Principal photography began on February 14, 2001 and wrapped on 27 April. It was filmed in various Southern California cities including Main Street in Seal Beach. Two versions of the film were released: the theatrical version and the unrated version. For the theatrical version, the film was cut slightly with a total of 19 scenes being altered. As a result, &quot;American Pie 2&quot; achieved an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America due to &quot;strong sexual content, crude humor, language and drinking.&quot;

==Release==
===Home media===
&quot;American Pie 2&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on January 15, 2002. The movie was released in two different versions: the theatrical version and the unrated version. They consist of widescreen and fullscreen versions and feature Dolby Digital and DTS audio tracks.

==Reception==
===Box office===
During its opening weekend, &quot;American Pie 2&quot; grossed $45.1 million from 3,063 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking at number one at the box office above &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;, a record for an R-rated comedy, surpassing &quot;Scary Movie&quot;. This record would be held until 2008 when it was surpassed by &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. Overall, it had the second-highest opening weekend for any R-rated film, behind &quot;Hannibal&quot;. For 14 years, the film would hold the record for having the highest August opening weekend for an R-rated film until &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; took it in 2015. It was the fourth consecutive Universal film of the year to reach $40 million in a single weekend, after &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;, &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;. For the first time in history, four consecutive films had approached the $45 million mark in their opening weekends, after the latter film, &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. &quot;American Pie 2&quot; became the first film to top the box office for multiple weeks since &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;.

The film&#x27;s theatrical run wrapped up on December 20, 2001, with a final domestic gross of $145,103,595 and $142,450,000 overseas, adding to a total worldwide gross of $232,722,935. It grossed $8.4 million in its opening weekend in Germany, a record for a comedy and for United International Pictures in the country, beating UIP&#x27;s previous record set by &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. In the UK, the film dethroned &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; to reach the number one spot, earning $8 million. It spent three weeks at the top of the box office before being displaced by &quot;The Others&quot;.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 52% based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Being a sequel, &quot;American Pie 2&quot; doesn&#x27;t retain the freshness of the original, nor is it as funny.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100 based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average rating of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. In &quot;At the Movies&quot;, Ebert and Richard Roeper both gave the film &quot;two thumbs up&quot;, with Roeper stating that the film had &quot;more laughs than the original&quot;.

<text>Máirín Anne Uí Dhálaigh or Máirín O&#x27;Daly (; 30 November 1908 – 25 January 1994) was a scholar of the Irish language and the wife of the 5th President of Ireland, Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh.

==Early life and education==
She was the second of five children baptised as Mary but always known as Maureen in the family. Her father Lawrence MacDermott was from Dublin and her mother Victoria Louisa Bradley was from Tralee, County Kerry. She was born in Mussoorie, India, where her father was a professor and teacher with the Royal Munster Fusiliers. At age six she was sent to her father&#x27;s sister in Tralee. She was educated at various schools in Dublin, and studied Latin and Irish in University College Dublin (UCD). While there in 1931, she gave an address on &quot;Women in Irish life long ago&quot; which Philip O&#x27;Leary described in 2004 as &quot;unapologetically feminist&quot;. She worked as a teacher before completing a masters in Old Irish.

==Professional life==
She joined the arts faculty at UCD, and later (from 1965 on) served on the governing body. For the Irish Texts Society, she edited &quot;Cath Maige Mucrama&quot; and produced a glossary and corrections for &quot;The Life of Aodh Ruadh Ó Domhnaill&quot;. She also contributed to the Royal Irish Academy&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of the Irish Language&quot;.

She got to know Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh at UCD, through the Literary and Historical Society, Conradh na Gaeilge and hillwalking club; in 1934, they were married. The couple had no children.

From 1979 to 1985, she served as a pro-chancellor of Trinity College Dublin. In 1985, she was also made an honorary fellow of Trinity College Dublin.

She donated her husband&#x27;s extensive personal archive to UCD in two substantial donations in 1980 and 1981 opening up his public career of over four decades. In 1983, five years after her husband&#x27;s death, she was appointed to the Council of State by his successor, President Patrick Hillery. Her last years were blighted by ill health. She is buried with her husband in Sneem, County Kerry.

<doc id="241482" wikidata="Q466423" url="?curid=241482" title="American Wedding">
<text>American Wedding (known as American Pie 3: The Wedding or American Pie: The Wedding, in some countries) is a 2003 American sex comedy film written by Adam Herz and directed by Jesse Dylan. It is the sequel to &quot;American Pie&quot; (1999) and &quot;American Pie 2&quot; (2001), and the third of the &quot;American Pie&quot; franchise.

The film&#x27;s main plot focuses on the wedding ceremony of Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) and Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan), while its subplot centers on Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), and his outrageous antics including his attempt to organize a bachelor party, teaching Jim to dance for the wedding, and competing with Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) to win the heart of Michelle&#x27;s sister, Cadence (January Jones). It is the last film in the series to be written by Herz, who conceptualized the franchise, and also the only theatrical film in the series in which Chris Klein (Oz), Chris Owen (Sherman), Mena Suvari (Heather), Tara Reid (Vicky), Shannon Elizabeth (Nadia) and Natasha Lyonne (Jessica) do not appear.

Released on August 1, 2003, &quot;American Wedding&quot; is the lowest-grossing installment in the theatrical &quot;American Pie&quot; film series, although it was still a box office success, grossing $232.7 million worldwide on a $55 million budget. Like the previous two films, &quot;American Wedding&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, who were again divided on its humor but praised the cast&#x27;s performances, especially Scott&#x27;s.

The franchise was later expanded into a series of direct-to-DVD standalone spin-offs, under the umbrella title &quot;American Pie Presents&quot;, that began with the release of &quot;Band Camp&quot; (2005). A direct sequel to &quot;Wedding&quot;, titled &quot;American Reunion&quot;, was released in 2012.

==Plot==
In East Great Falls, Michigan, in a restaurant, Jim Levenstein hints to his girlfriend Michelle that he is about to propose, until his dad calls to inform him he left the ring at home. Michelle misinterprets Jim&#x27;s hints and performs fellatio on him under the table as his dad arrives with the ring and the pair are publicly exposed. Despite the awkwardness, Michelle accepts Jim&#x27;s proposal.

Jim and Michelle exclude their acquaintance, the boorish and vulgar Steven Stifler, from the wedding plans, but he notices the celebration party while passing and insists on taking part, seeing an opportunity to have sex with the bridesmaids. Jim agrees to let Stifler join in exchange for teaching Jim to dance so he can surprise Michelle. Stifler, Jim, and his friends Paul Finch and Kevin Myers, travel to Chicago to secure Michelle&#x27;s dream wedding dress, and trace the designer to a gay bar. Stifler&#x27;s insecurity around homosexuals annoys the patrons, but he wins them over during a dance off with a large gay man called Bear. Entertained, Bear offers to provide strippers for Jim&#x27;s bachelor party, while the dress designer agrees to make Michelle&#x27;s dress.

Michelle&#x27;s younger sister, Cadence, returns to Michigan for the wedding after breaking up with her boyfriend because he would not take her virginity. Hoping to win Cadence over, Stifler acts refined and intelligent like Finch, while Finch acts like Stifler, and Cadence takes a liking to them both. Meanwhile, Jim begins to have doubts about marriage, worried that he has only ever been with one woman. His father&#x27;s awkward reassurances fail to convince Jim. Stifler, Finch, and Kevin break into Jim&#x27;s parents house to surprise Jim with the bachelor party and Bear&#x27;s strippers, unaware Jim is bringing Michelle&#x27;s parents over for dinner. The boys conceal the party from Michelle&#x27;s parents until her mother finds a stripped and bound Kevin in the closet. They convince her parents that it is an elaborate plot to impress them by portraying Jim as a hero who rescues Kevin.

In Grand Traverse County, Michigan, wedding preparations are underway despite mishaps when Jim&#x27;s shaved pubic hair is sucked into a kitchen vent, destroying the wedding cake, his grandmother expresses dislike for Michelle not being Jewish, and Stifler accidentally feeds the wedding ring to a dog. Cadence admits she likes Stifler but questions if he is pretending to be different around her. After Cadence agrees to sleep with Stifler, he steals a bottle of champagne from the kitchen, inadvertently turning off the cold room and killing the wedding flowers within. Jim and Michelle demand Stifler leaves, supported by Cadence, who has learned of his true personality and intentions.

Feeling guilty, Stifler works through the night to convince the florist to put together new floral displays, and enlists the help of his high school football team players and Bear. Seeing the new display, Michelle and Jim forgive Stifler, and Cadence reconciles with him, seeing he does genuinely care about his friends, and agrees to have sex with him in a supply closet before the wedding. Stifler is delayed by Jim, who thanks him, Finch, and Kevin for their help and support over the years. Unaware that Cadence was also delayed, Stifler enters the dark closet and has sex with someone, revealed to be Jim&#x27;s grandmother, who was put there by ushers because of her unlikable personality. Jim&#x27;s grandmother becomes more pleasant afterward to the delight of Jim&#x27;s dad and Michelle. Struggling to convey her feelings through her vows, Michelle asks Jim&#x27;s dad for help, who explains that love is not just a feeling, but the actions they do for each other; she happily thanks and calls him dad.

Michelle and Jim get married and share their first dance together, privately acknowledging their shared awkwardness and perversions that make them perfect for each other. Stifler dances with Cadence, while the rejected Finch sits alone until Stifler&#x27;s mom arrives. Though agreeing they are over each other following their previous trysts, they both retire to her room.

==Cast==

== Production ==
The outdoor wedding scene was filmed at the Ritz-Carlton Half Moon Bay near San Francisco.

And, this is the first film to feature the song &quot;Laid&quot; (Matt Nathanson covering the band James) in both the trailers and the opening sequence. Notably, it is also the only film in the series to not play the song &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; in a scene where Finch has sex with Stifler&#x27;s mother.

The song &quot;Into the Mystic&quot;, played at the end of the film when Jim and Michelle take to the dance floor at the reception, begins as Van Morrison&#x27;s recording, but midway through it changes to The Wallflowers&#x27; cover version due to licensing reasons.

<doc id="241484" wikidata="Q29825292" url="?curid=241484" title="Flaccus">
<text>Flaccus was a &quot;cognomen&quot; of the ancient Roman plebeian family Fulvius, considered one of the most illustrious &quot;gentes&quot; of the city. Cicero and Pliny the Elder state that the family was originally from Tusculum, and that members still lived there in the 1st century.

As usual for &quot;cognomina&quot;, &quot;Flaccus&quot; was likely originally a nickname, probably of Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, the founder of the family. The etymology of &quot;Flaccus&quot; is unknown, but it is similar to other adjectives describing deformities of the body, like &quot;brocc(h)us&quot; (buck-toothed), &quot;lippus&quot; (blear-eyed), etc. It has been variously interpreted as meaning &quot;big ears&quot;, &quot;flop ears&quot;, &quot;lop-eared&quot;, &quot;floppy&quot;, or &quot;fatty&quot;.

&quot;Flaccus&quot; was also a &quot;cognomen&quot; for a branch of the patrician Valerii and others.

<text>Vincent Albert &quot;Buddy&quot; Cianci Jr. (, ; , ; April 30, 1941 – January 28, 2016) was an American politician, attorney, radio talk show host, and political commentator who served as the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island from 1975 to 1984 and again from 1991 to 2002. Cianci was the longest-serving mayor of Providence, having held office for over 21 years.

Cianci was twice elected Mayor of Providence. Earlier in his career, he served as a state prosecutor in the Rhode Island Department of Attorney General. Cianci was forced to resign from office during both mayoral tenures due to felony convictions. His first administration ended in 1984 when he pleaded no contest to charges brought against him involving kidnapping and torturing a man Cianci believed was romantically involved with his ex-wife. His second stint as mayor ended when he was forced to resign following his conviction for one count of racketeering conspiracy, and he served four years in federal prison.

Cianci was first elected mayor as the candidate of the Republican Party. While in office, he declared himself an independent and, , he said that he had no party affiliation. On his radio show in June 2014, Cianci announced that he would run for mayor again. He was defeated by Democratic candidate Jorge Elorza in the 2014 election.

==Family and personal life==
Cianci was born on April 30, 1941, in Providence, Rhode Island. His family lived in the Laurel Hill section of nearby Cranston, Rhode Island. Cianci was the younger child of Dr. Vincent Albert Cianci and Esther Cianci, &quot;née&quot; Capobianco (whose great-grandfather served as mayor of Benevento, Italy), who married in 1937.

His only marriage, in 1973, was to Sheila Bentley McKenna; the couple divorced in 1983. They had one daughter, Nicole, who died in 2012. Shortly before dying in early 2016, the 74-year-old Cianci announced his engagement to model and actress Tara Marie Haywood, then in her 30s.

===Education and military service===
At the age of seven, Cianci began appearing regularly on WJAR&#x27;s &quot;Kiddie Revue&quot; Sunday radio broadcast from the Outlet Department Store on Weybosset Street, downtown Providence. After briefly attending public school, Cianci enrolled in Moses Brown School, a private school on the East Side of Providence. There, he became the roommate of Adrian Hendricks, the first Black student to attend the prestigious school. Later, Cianci transferred schools and would earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree in government at Fairfield University.

Cianci earned a master&#x27;s degree in Political Science at Villanova University and a Juris Doctor at Marquette University Law School in 1966. Cianci also held honorary doctorates awarded by Fairfield University (his alma mater), Johnson &amp; Wales University, Roger Williams University, and, most recently, from the Southern New England School of Law.

Cianci enlisted in the United States Army on November 29, 1966. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Military Police Corps on April 24, 1967. He served on active duty until 1969 and then in the Army Reserve as a civil affairs officer through 1972.

==Early legal career==
After being admitted to the Rhode Island Bar Association in 1967, Cianci was hired by Rhode Island Attorney General Herbert F. DeSimone as a special assistant attorney general in 1969. The position was part-time but prestigious. In 1972, Cianci backed up lead prosecutor Irving Brodsky in the trial of mob boss Raymond L.S. Patriarca. Patriarca was found not guilty, but Cianci won praise as an Italian American fighting &quot;The Mob&quot;, when the film &quot;The Godfather&quot; painted an unflattering image of Italian Americans.

In 1973, he became the prosecutor of the Rhode Island Attorney General&#x27;s Anti-Corruption Strike Force, a position he held until his first election as mayor in 1974. As part of this task force, Cianci was involved in an investigation of Providence Mayor Joseph A. Doorley Jr. Cianci gained a reputation as an anti-corruption crusader.

During this time, Cianci gained political experience working on Attorney General Herbert DeSimone&#x27;s unsuccessful campaigns for governor in 1970 and 1972.

==Mayor of Providence, 1974–1984==

In the fall of 1974, Cianci narrowly beat incumbent Mayor Joseph A. Doorley Jr. on an anti-corruption campaign. Cianci was helped by a revolt of Democrats upset with Doorley&#x27;s administration. Cianci presented himself as a visionary reformer, outlining plans to revive an economically troubled downtown, rebuild the waterfront, restore blighted neighborhoods, create parks, and improve schools. Positioning himself as &quot;the Anti-Corruption candidate,&quot; an Italian-American candidate taking on the Irish-American Democratic machine, Cianci won his first election by 709 votes.

Cianci became the city&#x27;s first Italian-American Republican mayor, ending a 150-year &quot;power monopoly&quot; held by Irish Democrats. At the age of 33 years, 10 months and seven days, he was then the city&#x27;s youngest mayor and the first Republican to lead that heavily Democratic city since 1939. Cianci was well known to be a charismatic and media-savvy politician. Cianci&#x27;s propensity to attend parades, weddings, public events, and backyard neighborhood barbecues prompted a common joke that Cianci would jump to &quot;attend the opening of an envelope&quot;. Cianci was revered by many residents of Providence, credited with the revitalizing of the city&#x27;s economy and image.

In the mid- to late 1970s, Cianci became a rising star in the national Republican Party. After being introduced by Bob Dole, Cianci made an address at the 1976 Republican convention. There was talk of him being the first Italian-American vice president. Cianci was also seriously considered for a federal Cabinet seat in the second Gerald Ford administration, had Ford been elected in 1976. After Ford&#x27;s loss to Jimmy Carter, Cianci promoted himself as a candidate for one of Rhode Island&#x27;s U.S. Senate seats, aiming to expand the Republican Party&#x27;s ethnic votership. Cianci clashed behind the scenes with John Chafee over Rhode Island&#x27;s Republican nomination for the Senate seat. Chafee was elected to the Senate in 1976 and Cianci was re-elected as Mayor of Providence as a Republican in 1978.

Cianci ran for governor in 1980, losing out to incumbent J. Joseph Garrahy. After this loss, Cianci drifted away from the Republican Party after he was not given an appointment in the Reagan administration despite his support of Ronald Reagan and intimations by Reagan&#x27;s campaign manager, John Sears. In 1982, he was reelected as Mayor of Providence as an independent.

During his first tenure in office, Buddy Cianci often clashed with the Providence City Council over issues such as the municipal budget. Cianci was supported by political allies in the Providence City Council&#x27;s Republican minority.

===First resignation (1984)===
During Cianci&#x27;s first administration, the Providence City Council tried to create an ordinance for residents of the city to be able to vote their public officials out of office.

Cianci was forced by law to resign from office for the first time in 1984 after pleading &quot;nolo contendere&quot; or &quot;no contest&quot;. Cianci claimed that the man had been romantically involved with his wife, from whom Cianci was separated at the time. Both DeLeo and Cianci&#x27;s estranged wife disputed the relationship. Cianci and his driver were charged with kidnaping, beating, and torturing Deleo. Providence municipal regulations prohibit a convicted felon from holding public office. Ironically, Cianci had promulgated that rule a few years earlier.

After Cianci&#x27;s resignation, a special election was held to name a replacement. Cianci attempted to run in the election under the rubric that he had been convicted of a felony but received a five-year suspended sentence rather than being sent to prison. After a few weeks, it was decided by the Rhode Island Supreme Court that Cianci could not run in the special election, because the legislative intent was that the convicted incumbent could not succeed himself in office. The special election was won by City Council Chairman, Acting Mayor, and future ambassador to Malta Joseph R. Paolino Jr.

==Talk show host, 1984–1991==
Cianci spent the next few years as a radio talk show host on Providence AM station 920 WHJJ and as a television commentator. In 1990, he successfully mounted a reelection campaign with the slogan, &quot;He never stopped caring about Providence.&quot;

In the early 2000s, Cianci also made several guest appearances as himself on the television show &quot;Providence&quot;.

==Mayor of Providence, 1991–2002==

During Cianci&#x27;s second run as mayor, beginning in 1991, the city of Providence entered its &quot;Renaissance phase&quot;.

During his tenure, Providence became visibly cleaner and more tourist-friendly. Cianci brought the Providence Bruins hockey team to Rhode Island from Maine and pushed to further several projects in the city, including new hotels, the Providence Place shopping mall and the Fleet Skating Center. He also helped to orchestrate the establishment of the summer weekend festivals known as WaterFire in downtown Providence, which continues to bring up to 100,000 people to the downtown area alone on the summer nights it takes place.

=== Mayor&#x27;s Own Marinara Sauce ===
In 1995, Cianci launched a brand of tomato sauce, &quot;Mayor&#x27;s Own Marinara Sauce.&quot; It was claimed that proceeds from sales were &quot;Benefiting Providence School Children&quot; and helped hundreds of students attend college. However, an August 2014 Associated Press report found that &quot;in recent years, no money from the sauce&#x27;s sales has been donated to Cianci&#x27;s charity scholarship fund.&quot; From 2009 to 2012, the sauce made a total of $3 in income, longtime Cianci adviser Charles Mansolillo told the AP. In 2009, they lost $2,200 on the sauce, Mansolillo said. The following year, they made $2,974, while in 2011, they lost $2,969. In 2012, they made $2,198 profit, he said. That adds up to a profit of just $3 during the 4-year period.&quot;

===Arts-friendly city===
In 1996, Cianci pushed to create an arts and entertainment district in downtown Providence by offering income and sales tax breaks to attract artists to downtown. Cianci said the tax breaks were part of an arts-centered economic development strategy. The idea was to develop an image of Providence as an &quot;artist-friendly&quot; city; this would attract not only artists but also well-educated workers, high-technology firms, economic development, and tourism. The strategy was copied as a model by Baltimore and other cities.

In 1998, Cianci ran again for reelection, unopposed on the ballot. The popular Cianci had never lost a mayoral election, until losing to Jorge Elorza in November 2014. 

===Operation Plunder Dome===
Cianci was indicted in April 2001 on federal criminal charges of racketeering, conspiracy, extortion, witness tampering, and mail fraud. Several other Providence city officials were also indicted. Judge Ronald R. Lagueux said of the case: &quot;Clearly, there is a feeling in city government in Providence that corruption is tolerated. In this mayor&#x27;s two administrations, there has been more corruption in the City of Providence than in the history of this state.&quot;

Much of the trial was focused around a video tape showing top Cianci aide Director of Administration Frank A. Corrente taking a bribe. NBC reporter Jim Taricani aired the tape on local television station WJAR, and he was sentenced to six months of house arrest for refusing to reveal his sources to the court. Cianci did not maintain a low profile after the indictment but poked fun at the investigation, code-named &quot;Operation Plunder Dome&quot;. Nine people (including Cianci) were convicted in the trials, which were presided over by Judge Ernest C. Torres. Cianci was acquitted of 26 out of 27 charges, including bribery, extortion, and mail fraud, but he was found guilty of racketeering conspiracy, running a corrupt criminal enterprise.

In September 2002, Cianci was sentenced to serve five years in federal prison by Judge Torres, who opted for a higher sentence than the minimum required by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Cianci was forced by law to resign immediately following the sentencing.

Between his sentencing and the start of his jail term, Cianci resumed his radio career hosting a midday show with former Providence radio host (and former director of communications to Governor Don Carcieri) Steve Kass on AM talk station WPRO. After some legal wrangling, Cianci&#x27;s lawyers managed to have him sent to prison closer to Rhode Island, and Cianci served his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Dix, in Burlington County, New Jersey. Cianci appealed the conviction to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit but was unsuccessful. In August 2005, Cianci made a request for early release but was denied.

==Later life==
Cianci was released from prison on May 30, 2007, to a halfway house near Northeastern University in Boston.
Upon his initial release from federal prison, he had already secured a job in marketing and sales for the XV Beacon, a luxury hotel in Boston. However, he ultimately chose to return to Rhode Island and began work at the 903 Residences in Providence.

On the animated sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot; (set in Rhode Island), Chris attended Buddy Cianci Junior High School. One episode released in 2005 was titled &quot;Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High&quot;.

===Political commentator===
On September 20, 2007, Cianci returned to the airwaves on local Providence AM radio station WPRO, hosting a weekday talk show. He said that he had no plans to run for political office again, although he had not entirely ruled it out when pressed on the issue. On October 24, 2007, Cianci appeared on WLNE-TV ABC6 to announce that in addition to his radio show, he was joining the television station as chief political analyst and contributing editor. The work included moderating a weekly political segment called &quot;Your Attention Please&quot;, which was renamed &quot;Buddy TV.&quot; The timeslot became a daily segment in July 2008, and was renamed &quot;The World According to Buddy&quot; as of May 2011. His position at WLNE began on November 1, 2007. Cianci also hosted the station&#x27;s weekend public affairs program &quot;On the Record with Buddy Cianci&quot;. He began in October 2008 as cohost of the program with WLNE weeknight anchor John DeLuca and became solo host in May 2011.

===2014 campaign for Mayor of Providence===
Cianci became eligible to run for mayor again in the year 2012, three years after his probation ended (due to the provisions of the 1986 Rhode Island constitutional amendment, aptly named &quot;the Buddy amendment&quot;). The next election in which Cianci would have been eligible to run was the November 2014. In 2010, Cianci was quoted as saying that he was &quot;taking a good look&quot; at running for the U.S. House seat to be vacated by Democrat Patrick J. Kennedy. He did not declare his candidacy.

In May 2014, Cianci, after being successfully treated for cancer, was cleared by his doctors to run for mayor in the 2014 November election. On June 25, Cianci declared his candidacy for Mayor of Providence as an independent. In August, he named former Cianci staffer Cyd McKenna as his campaign manager and Dee Dee Witman as his finance chair, alongside other former staffers Charles Mansolillo and Beryl Kenyon. Providence hip-hop artist Zumo Kollie released a song titled &quot;Buddy Cianci&quot; on November 4, 2014. His campaign was unsuccessful and he lost narrowly to Democrat Jorge Elorza, conceding the election on November 4.

===Illness and death===
In January 2014, Cianci was diagnosed with colon cancer.

Cianci died on January 28, 2016, at the age of 74. He had been taken to the hospital the previous day after experiencing abdominal pain while filming his television show, &quot;On the Record with Buddy Cianci&quot;, at the WLNE-TV studio.

Thousands of people viewed Cianci&#x27;s open casket as his body lay in state for two days in Providence City Hall, the first mayor to be so honored since Thomas Doyle in 1886. A horse-drawn carriage carried his casket through the city during a snowstorm on February 8, as it made its way to the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul where Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Joseph Tobin presided over a funeral mass. The funeral procession then passed through Olneyville and Silver Lake, where Cianci grew up, ending at St. Ann&#x27;s Cemetery in Cranston for a private burial next to his parents and daughter, Nicole.

==Further reading and documentary film==
*&quot;The Prince of Providence&quot;, a book by Mike Stanton () details Cianci&#x27;s life, from childhood, to mob-busting prosecutor, to mayor, to conviction. The Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, Rhode Island, began its 2019–20 season with the world premiere of &quot;The Prince of Providence&quot; by George Brant, based on the book. The musical &quot;&quot;Buddy&quot; Cianci: The Musical&quot; was created by Jonathan Van Gieson and Mike Tarantino and was performed off-Broadway. It derived much of its material from Stanton&#x27;s book.
*&quot;Politics and Pasta: How I Prosecuted Mobsters, Rebuilt a Dying City, Advised a President, Dined with Sinatra, Spent Five Years in a Federally Funded Gated Community, and Lived to Tell the Tale&quot;, a book by Vincent &quot;Buddy&quot; Cianci with David Fisher (), is Cianci&#x27;s memoir.
*Cianci is the subject of the documentary film &quot;Buddy: The Rise and Fall of America&#x27;s Most Notorious Mayor (ISBN 8371014197&quot;10), directed by Cherry Arnold and narrated by James Woods.
* Season One of &quot;Crimetown&quot;, a podcast by Marc Smerling and Zac Stuart-Pontier, focuses on Mayor Cianci&#x27;s ties to organized crime in New England.

<doc id="241490" wikidata="Q7243214" url="?curid=241490" title="Prime-factor FFT algorithm">
<text>The prime-factor algorithm (PFA), also called the Good–Thomas algorithm (1958/1963), is a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm that re-expresses the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a size &quot;N&quot; = &quot;N&quot;1&quot;N&quot;2 as a two-dimensional &quot;N&quot;1×&quot;N&quot;2 DFT, but &quot;only&quot; for the case where &quot;N&quot;1 and &quot;N&quot;2 are relatively prime. These smaller transforms of size &quot;N&quot;1 and &quot;N&quot;2 can then be evaluated by applying PFA recursively or by using some other FFT algorithm.

PFA should not be confused with the &quot;mixed-radix&quot; generalization of the popular Cooley–Tukey algorithm, which also subdivides a DFT of size &quot;N&quot; = &quot;N&quot;1&quot;N&quot;2 into smaller transforms of size &quot;N&quot;1 and &quot;N&quot;2. The latter algorithm can use &quot;any&quot; factors (not necessarily relatively prime), but it has the disadvantage that it also requires extra multiplications by roots of unity called twiddle factors, in addition to the smaller transforms. On the other hand, PFA has the disadvantages that it only works for relatively prime factors (e.g. it is useless for power-of-two sizes) and that it requires more complicated re-indexing of the data based on the additive group isomorphisms. Note, however, that PFA can be combined with mixed-radix Cooley–Tukey, with the former factorizing &quot;N&quot; into relatively prime components and the latter handling repeated factors.

PFA is also closely related to the nested Winograd FFT algorithm, where the latter performs the decomposed &quot;N&quot;1 by &quot;N&quot;2 transform via more sophisticated two-dimensional convolution techniques. Some older papers therefore also call Winograd&#x27;s algorithm a PFA FFT.

(Although the PFA is distinct from the Cooley–Tukey algorithm, Good&#x27;s 1958 work on the PFA was cited as inspiration by Cooley and Tukey in their 1965 paper, and there was initially some confusion about whether the two algorithms were different. In fact, it was the only prior FFT work cited by them, as they were not then aware of the earlier research by Gauss and others.)

==Algorithm==
Let formula_1 be a polynomial and formula_2 be a principal formula_3-th root of unity. We define the DFT of formula_1 as the formula_3-tuple formula_6.
In other words,
formula_7
For simplicity, we denote the transformation as formula_8.

The PFA relies on a coprime factorization of formula_9 and turns formula_8 into formula_11 for some choices of formula_12&#x27;s where formula_13 is the tensor product.

=== Mapping Based on CRT ===

For a coprime factorization formula_9, we have the Chinese remainder map formula_15 from formula_16 to formula_17 with formula_18 as its inverse where formula_19&#x27;s are the central orthogonal idempotent elements with formula_20.
Choosing formula_21 (therefore, formula_22), we rewrite formula_8 as follows:
formula_24
Finally, define formula_25 and formula_26, 
we have 
formula_27
Therefore, we have the multi-dimensional DFT, formula_28.

=== As Algebra Isomorphisms ===
PFA can be stated in a high-level way in terms of algebra isomorphisms.
We first recall that for a commutative ring formula_29 and a group isomorphism from formula_30 to formula_31,
we have the following algebra isomorphism
formula_32 where formula_33 refers to the tensor product of algebras.

To see how PFA works, we choose formula_34 and formula_35 be additive groups.
We also identify formula_36 as formula_37 and formula_38 as formula_39.
Choosing formula_40 as the group isomorphism formula_41, we have the algebra isomorphism formula_42, or alternatively,
formula_43
Now observe that formula_8 is actually an algebra isomorphism from formula_37 to formula_46 and each formula_47 is an algebra isomorphism from formula_48 to formula_49,
we have an algebra isomorphism formula_50 from formula_51 to formula_46.
What PFA tells us is that formula_53 where formula_54 and formula_50 are re-indexing without actual arithmetic in formula_29.

=== Counting the Number of Multi-Dimensional Transformations ===
Notice that the condition for transforming formula_8 into formula_58 relies on &quot;an&quot; additive group isomorphism formula_59 from formula_60 to formula_61.
Any additive group isomorphism will work.
To count the number of ways transforming formula_8 into formula_58,
we only need to count the number of additive group isomorphisms from formula_60 to formula_61, or alternative, the number of additive group automorphisms on formula_60.
Since formula_60 is cyclic, any automorphism can be written as formula_68 where formula_69 is a generator of formula_60.
By the definition of formula_60, formula_69&#x27;s are exactly those coprime to formula_3.
Therefore, there are exactly formula_74 many such maps where formula_75 is the Euler&#x27;s totient function.
The smallest example is formula_76 where formula_77, demonstrating the two maps in the literature: the &quot;CRT mapping&quot; and the &quot;Ruritanian mapping&quot;.

<text>Albatros Flugzeugwerke GmbH was a German aircraft manufacturer best known for supplying the German Luftstreitkräfte during World War I.

The company was based in Johannisthal, Berlin, where it was founded by Walter Huth and Otto Wiener on December 20, 1909. The company (and its subsidiary, Ostdeutsche Albatros Werke (OAW)) produced many capable fighter aircraft, notably the Albatros D.III and Albatros D.V, both designed by Robert Thelen. The Albatros merged into Focke-Wulf in 1931.

== History ==
The company was founded in Berlin-Johannisthal in late 1909 by Enno Walther Huth as the Albatros Werke AG.
The first aircraft the company produced was a French Antoinette monoplane, which they built under licence.

They then produced several versions of the Etrich Taube monoplane, as well the Doppeltaube biplane which used the same basic planform. A variety of other biplanes, with more conventional wing planforms were also built and flown.

In 1912, five Albatros F-2 were built. This was a development of the French Farman III biplane (hence the letter F) with a gondola for the crew and an Argus in-line engine instead of the original Gnome Omega rotary engine. Four were sold to Bulgaria where they took an active part in the 1912–1913 Balkan wars.

On October 16, 1912, one of these carried out the first combat mission over Europe.

During World War I, Albatros Flugzeugwerke produced about 10,300 aircraft, including fighters, bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. After the war, production of various civilian types was carried out.

<text>The &#x27;no&#x27; campaign was a Eurosceptic campaign in the United Kingdom beginning in 2000 which was opposed to the UK&#x27;s adoption of the euro. The campaign was funded by Business for Sterling and New Europe groups and was mothballed in spring 2004 after Chancellor Gordon Brown ruled out UK membership of the euro for the foreseeable future. The campaign was founded by Nick Herbert, who as chief executive of Business for Sterling hired Dominic Cummings as campaign director.

The campaign title was simply &quot;No&quot; while its slogan and explanation was &quot;Europe Yes. Euro No.&quot;

<text>This is a complete listing of the [[Suburbs and localities (Australia)|suburbs and localities]] in the greater [[Sydney]] area in alphabetical order.
Sydney has about 30 local government areas, each consisting of several suburbs. Suburbs in Australia are purely geographical, not political, divisions, but have officially defined boundaries. The term “suburban” is used for such defined districts throughout the metropolitan area, even in the city centre. See table below, :Category: Suburbs of Sydney and :Category: Local government areas in Sydney.

Suburbs are listed here if they are inside the Sydney metropolitan area, and are listed in the New South Wales Geographical Names Register as being suburbs. For this list, the boundaries of the Sydney metropolitan area are defined as the Hawkesbury/Nepean River in the north/north west, and then the outer boundaries of the City of Penrith, Camden Council, the City of Campbelltown and Sutherland Shire.

Some but not all Sydney localities are also listed, and localities are shown in italics to differentiate them from suburbs. Further localities may be added if they are on the Geographical Names Register, are inside the Sydney metropolitan area, and are also listed in the &quot;Suburb and Localities Index&quot; of the most recent (2019) edition of the Sydney UBD Street Directory.

<text>Terry-Thomas (born Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens; 10 July 1911 – 8 January 1990) was an English character actor and comedian who became internationally known through his films during the 1950s and 1960s. He often portrayed disreputable members of the upper classes, especially , toffs and , using his distinctive voice; his costume and props tended to include a monocle, waistcoat and cigarette holder. His striking dress sense was set off by a gap between his two upper front teeth.

Born in London, Terry-Thomas made his film debut, uncredited, in &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; (1933). He spent several years appearing in smaller roles, before wartime service with Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) and Stars in Battledress. The experience helped sharpen his cabaret and revue act, increased his public profile and proved instrumental in the development of his successful comic stage routine. On his demobilisation, he starred in &quot;Piccadilly Hayride&quot; on the London stage and was the star of the first comedy series on British television, &quot;How Do You View?&quot; (1949). He appeared on various BBC Radio shows, and made a successful transition into British films. His most creative period was the 1950s when he appeared in &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1956), &quot;The Green Man&quot; (1956), &quot;Blue Murder at St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (1957), &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot; (1959) and &quot;Carlton-Browne of the F.O.&quot; (1959).

From the early 1960s Terry-Thomas began appearing in American films, coarsening his already unsubtle screen character in films such as &quot;Bachelor Flat&quot; (1962), &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963) and &quot;How to Murder Your Wife&quot; (1965). From the mid-1960s on he also frequently starred in European films, in roles such as Sir Reginald in the successful French film &quot;La Grande Vadrouille&quot;. In 1971 Terry-Thomas was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, which slowly brought his career to a conclusion; his last film role was in 1980. He spent much of his fortune on medical treatment and, shortly before his death, was living in poverty, existing on charity from the Actors&#x27; Benevolent Fund. In 1989 a charity gala was held in his honour, which raised sufficient funds for him to live his remaining time in a nursing home.

==Biography==
===Early life: 1911–1933===

Terry-Thomas was born Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens at 53 Lichfield Grove, Finchley, North London. He was the fourth of five children born to Ernest Frederick Stevens, managing director of a butcher&#x27;s business at Smithfield Market and part-time amateur actor, and his wife Ellen Elizabeth Stevens (née Hoar). As a child, Terry-Thomas was often referred to as Tom, the diminutive used by his family. He led a generally happy childhood, but believed his parents secretly desired a daughter in his place. By the time he reached adolescence, his parents&#x27; marriage had failed and both had become alcoholics. In an attempt to bring them together, he often entertained them by performing impromptu slapstick routines, reciting jokes and singing and dancing around the family home. The performances seldom worked, and his father became increasingly distant from his family.

In 1921 Terry-Thomas began to nurture his distinctive, well-spoken voice, reasoning that &quot;using good speech automatically suggested that you were well-educated and made people look up to you&quot;. He used the speech of the actor Owen Nares as a basis for his own delivery. Terry-Thomas became fascinated by the stage, and regularly attended the Golders Green Hippodrome to see the latest shows. It was there that he developed an interest in fashion, and adopted the debonair dress-sense of his hero Douglas Fairbanks. Terry-Thomas attended Fernbank School in Hendon Lane, Finchley, which was a welcome escape from the stresses of his parents&#x27; break-up. When he was 13, he transferred to Ardingly College, a public school in Sussex. He excelled in Latin and geography, and briefly took up drama. The latter subject later led to his expulsion from the school, after his frequent and inappropriate use of ad lib during lessons. He also took up a position in the school jazz band, first playing the ukulele and then percussion. He also often performed comedy dance routines to the band&#x27;s music.
Terry-Thomas enjoyed his time at Ardingly, and relished his association with upper middle class school friends. His academic abilities were modest, and he came to the notice of staff only through his frequent tomfoolery. Although he initially felt intimidated by his school surroundings, his confidence grew as he put on &quot;a bold, undiluted and sustained show of &quot;chutzpah&quot;&quot;, according to his biographer, Graham McCann. On his return home to Finchley in 1927, his more mature manner impressed the family&#x27;s housekeeper Kate Dixon, who seduced him at the family home. He stayed at Ardingly for one more term and returned home to London, but made no plans to further his education or start long-term work. Instead, he accepted a temporary position at Smithfield Market, where he earned 15 shillings a week as a junior transport clerk for the Union Cold Storage Company.

By his own admission, he never stopped &quot;farting around&quot; and often kept his colleagues entertained with impersonations of the Hunchback of Notre-Dame and Erich von Stroheim. He invented various characters, including Colonel Featherstonehaugh-Bumleigh and Cora Chessington-Crabbe, and frequently recited comic stories involving them to his colleagues. His characterisations soon came to the notice of the company&#x27;s management who prompted him to enrol in the company&#x27;s amateur drama club. He made his début with the drama company as Lord Trench in &quot;The Dover Road&quot; which was staged at the Fortune Theatre, London. The production was popular with audiences, and he subsequently became a regular performer in amateur productions.

Terry-Thomas made his professional stage début on 11 April 1930 at a social evening organised by the Union of Electric Railwaymen&#x27;s Dining Club in South Kensington. He was billed as Thos Stevens, but only appeared as a minor turn. His performance brought heckles from the drunken audience, but earned him a commission of 30 shillings. After this, he played a few minor roles in Gilbert and Sullivan productions by the Edgware Operatic Society at the Scala Theatre. In 1933, he left Smithfield Market to work briefly with a friend at an electrical shop before he became travelling salesman of electrical equipment. He enjoyed the job and relished being able to dress up in elaborate clothing in order to make his pitch. In his spare time, he began playing the ukulele with a local jazz band called the Rhythm Maniacs. He took up dancing and formed a partnership with a sister of Jessie Matthews. The act starred in local exhibitions and at minor venues, and they earned well from it. News soon travelled of the couple&#x27;s talent, and they were engaged as ballroom dancers at a hall in Cricklewood. He found the dance-style too restrictive and he left the act to try other aspects of entertainment.

===Early performances: 1933–1939===
By 1933 Terry-Thomas had moved out of Finchley and into a friend&#x27;s flat; the friend was a film extra who introduced him to the idea of working in the industry. Terry-Thomas made his uncredited film debut in the 1933 film, &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot;, which starred Charles Laughton in the title role. Between 1933 and 1941 Terry-Thomas appeared in 16 films, as an uncredited extra in all but one; he later said that &quot;this work suited me down to the ground. It wasn&#x27;t really like work to me. I got an enormous kick out of it&quot;. His first speaking role came in the 1935 Buddy Rogers comedy &quot;Once in a Million&quot; where he shouted &quot;A thousand!&quot; during an auction. During the 1936 musical comedy &quot;This&#x27;ll Make You Whistle&quot;, starring Jack Buchanan, he permanently damaged his hearing as a result of jumping into a water tank. In between his film work, he developed his cabaret act and was employed as a dance teacher at the Aida Foster School of Dancing in Golders Green.

During this period, he billed himself as Thomas (or Thos) Stevens, but rearranged the name to its backward spelling of Mot Snevets; the name did not last long and he changed it to Thomas Terry. He soon realised that people were mistaking him as a relative of Dame Ellen Terry, so inverted the name to Terry Thomas. He did not add the hyphen until 1947, and later explained that it was &quot;not for snob reasons but to tie the two names together. They didn&#x27;t mean much apart; together they made a trade name&quot;: the hyphen was also &quot;to match the gap in his front teeth&quot;. By now, he was developing a unique sense of style both on and off stage. To avoid staining his fingers with smoke, he used a cigarette holder and later purchased &quot;the most irresistible holder in Dunhill&#x27;s. It was slightly because it was made of lacquered, black whangee ... with a gold band twisting neatly round it&quot;. Adding to his look were a &quot;monocle, raffish waistcoat and red carnation&quot;. He later wrote that &quot;sartorially I was an eccentric. But I knew that underneath the clothes I was very much a conservative Englishman who would have loved to have been a genuine eccentric&quot;.

In 1937 Terry-Thomas met the South African dancer and choreographer Ida Florence Patlansky, who went by the stage-name Pat Patlanski, while she was auditioning in London for a partner for her flamenco dancing act. Patlanski was keen to employ Terry-Thomas as a comedian rather than a dancer, and they established a cabaret double-act billed as &quot;Terri and Patlanski&quot;, which was immediately popular with audiences. The couple became romantically involved and married on 3 February 1938 at Marylebone Register Office, afterwards moving to 29 Bronwen Court in St John&#x27;s Wood. Despite the success of Terri and Patlanski, the act lasted only three months and they took on small engagements on the cabaret circuit. On 6 June 1938 Terry-Thomas made his first radio broadcast on the BBC London Regional dance programme &quot;Friends to Tea&quot;. He later recounted that &quot;I didn&#x27;t give a very good performance ... I was a dismal failure&quot;. At the end of the summer of 1938 they were hired by the bandleader Don Rico, who incorporated them into his orchestra, with Patlanski playing the piano and Terry-Thomas acting as the compère.

===Second World War===

The Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) was formed in 1938 to provide entertainment to the British Armed Forces. Terry-Thomas and Patlanski signed up in 1939 and during the Phoney War were posted to France, where they appeared in a variety show. From early in their marriage, Patlanski had affairs, which prompted Terry-Thomas to reciprocate; he made sure he was sent on tour to France where a girlfriend was due to perform, although Patlanski accompanied him on the trip. During the tour, Terry-Thomas ensured Patlanski was sent back to Britain to enable him to continue his affair. On his return to Britain, he continued with his solo variety act, while also acting as the head of the cabaret section of ENSA at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, where he clashed regularly with his counterparts running the drama sections, Sir Seymour Hicks and Lilian Braithwaite. Terry-Thomas aimed to produce &quot;good shows, sophisticated, impeccable and highly polished&quot;, which included the violinist Eugene Pini playing light classical music, and the Gainsborough Girls chorus line.

In April 1942 Terry-Thomas received his call-up papers; he later wrote that &quot;it would have seemed rather rude and ungrateful to refuse&quot;; as a result, he left ENSA and reported to the Royal Corps of Signals training depot in Ossett, West Riding of Yorkshire. Within two weeks of his arrival he hired Ossett Town Hall and staged a concert, which included a freshly written sketch about his feet, which had been suffering in his army boots. After basic training he was promoted to the rank of corporal and applied for a commission. He was turned down because training had caused a duodenal ulcer, and his hearing was still problematic; as a result he was downgraded from A1 to B1 fitness at the start of 1943.

Terry-Thomas continued to appear in cabaret and variety shows while in the army, including at the Astoria Cinema in York, where he was seen by George Black. Black established the entertainment troupe, Stars in Battledress, which was composed of entertainers who were serving in the forces, and he invited Terry-Thomas to join. In February 1943 he appeared in his first Stars in Battledress show at London&#x27;s Olympia, where he introduced the sketch &quot;Technical Hitch&quot;. This involved him portraying a harassed BBC announcer introducing records that are missing. In order to cover up for the absent records he would use his vocal range of four and a half octaves to mimic the singers; he included &quot;impersonations of Britain&#x27;s clipped crooner Noël Coward, the African-American bass-baritone Paul Robeson, the Peruvian songbird Yma Sumac, the Austrian tenor Richard Tauber and ... the entire Luton Girls Choir&quot;. The show went on a national tour, with the stand-up comedian Charlie Chester as compere, during which Terry-Thomas refined and polished his act and finished as &quot;one of the most prominent and influential members of Stars in Battledress&quot;.

Terry-Thomas, along with his Stars in Battledress unit, travelled through Britain and Europe on a tour that lasted several months. After the tour, and with his demobilisation approaching, he took compassionate leave to have free time while still receiving army pay. During his absence he went on a tour of the UK organised by George Black, accompanied on the piano by a former colonel, Harry Sutcliffe. Terry-Thomas finished the war as a sergeant, and was finally demobbed on 1 April 1946.

===Early post-war work: 1946–1955===
The ENSA and Stars in Battledress tours of Britain and Europe had raised Terry-Thomas&#x27;s profile and, by October 1946, he was appearing alongside Sid Field in &quot;Piccadilly Hayride&quot; at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London. The show was described by Graham McCann as &quot;the West End&#x27;s biggest money-spinner for years&quot;. Terry-Thomas compered the show as well as appearing in some of the sketches, including his own &quot;Technical Hitch&quot; routine. In 1959 he described the effect of &quot;Piccadilly Hayride&quot; on his career, saying &quot;This show made me overnight. I&#x27;d arrived&quot;. Ivor Brown, writing in &quot;The Observer&quot;, remarked on the &quot;glorious rag of BBC modes, moods and intonations by Mr. Terry Thomas, a grand discovery&quot;. Within three weeks of starting his run, Terry-Thomas was invited to appear at the Royal Command Performance on 4 November 1946 at the London Palladium.

&quot;Piccadilly Hayride&quot; ran for 778 performances and ended on 17 January 1948. The show was seen by over a million people and earned £350,000 at the box office. In conjunction with &quot;Piccadilly Hayride&quot;, Terry-Thomas undertook a number of other additional one-off appearances in cabaret and private functions. He also appeared in editions of &quot;Variety Bandbox&quot; and &quot;Workers&#x27; Playtime&quot; on BBC Radio. His ever-evolving act consisted of imitations, including that of his friend, the musician Leslie Hutchinson (known as &quot;Hutch&quot;); sketches, including &quot;Technical Hitch&quot;; urbane monologues, and &quot;languid shaggy dog stories&quot;. At the end of his run with &quot;Piccadilly Hayride&quot;, Terry-Thomas took a three-week break to recover from nervous exhaustion and a recurrence of his peptic ulcer. He went back to cabaret and acted as a compere at the London Palladium before making his radio breakthrough on 12 October 1948 with his own series on the BBC Home Service. Consisting of a &quot;mixture of sketches, solo routines, musical interludes and a range of popular and topical star guests&quot;, &quot;To Town with Terry&quot; was broadcast weekly and ran for 24 episodes until 28 March 1949. He was disappointed with the series, saying &quot;I was never totally satisfied with [it] ... The perfectionist in me always made me aware of anything that was less than first class&quot;. He also appeared in his first post-war film, &quot;A Date with a Dream&quot;, in 1949, alongside his wife.
On 26 October 1949 Terry-Thomas wrote and starred in a new series on the BBC Television Service, &quot;How Do You View?&quot;, noted for being the first comedy series on British television. The programme was based around an on-screen persona of Terry-Thomas as &quot;a glamorous, mischievous and discreetly cash-strapped man-about-town&quot;, introducing a series of sketches in which he appeared alongside Peter Butterworth as his chauffeur; Janet Brown (Butterworth&#x27;s real-life wife); Avril Angers; H.C. Walton as the family retainer, Moulting; and Diana Dors. The programme was broadcast live and often included Terry-Thomas walking through control rooms and corridors of the BBC&#x27;s Lime Grove and Alexandra Palace studios. The author and historian Mark Lewisohn described the series as being &quot;inventive ... truly televisual and not just a radio programme in costume&quot;. The series ran until 21 December 1949; a second series followed between April and May 1950, with Sid Colin taking over the scripting duties and Terry-Thomas providing additional material. By the third series, which was broadcast between November 1950 and February 1951, the audience reached four million viewers. In total there were five series of &quot;How Do You View?&quot;; the final episode was broadcast on 11 June 1952. Writing about Terry-Thomas on television, Wilfred Greatorex observed that &quot;he has ... physical attributes that make him a gift to visual entertainment: a large, rather gaunt face, pre-fabricated for close-ups; the notorious space of one-third of an inch between his two most prominent top teeth; a mouth that is full of expression. Add to these pictoral advantages his eight-inch cigarette holder and Eddie Cantor eyes&quot;.
In between filming &quot;How Do You View?&quot;, Terry-Thomas continued performing on radio as well as in cabaret, in Britain and increasingly the US. In October and November 1949 he appeared at the Palmer House Night Club, Chicago; in June 1951 he appeared at The Wedgwood Room, Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York, and between 22 December 1951 and 29 February 1952 he returned to the London Palladium for 109 performances in &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;. In September 1952 he travelled to the Federation of Malaya to entertain British troops in a series of concert parties, before returning to the UK to appear in the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; in November. He finished the year in South Africa, as Honourable Idle Jack in &quot;Dick Whittington&quot;, which finished in January 1953; he considered the pantomime to be &quot;so tatty and unrehearsed it was pathetic&quot;.

In June 1953 Terry-Thomas broadcast the pilot episode of the radio show, &quot;Top of the Town&quot;; the show was successful and the BBC commissioned a series of 16 episodes, which ran between November 1953 and February 1954. In between recording sessions, he appeared at the London Palladium in the revue &quot;Fun and the Fair&quot;, with George Formby and the Billy Cotton band, from October 1953. &quot;Fun and the Fair&quot; was unsuccessful at the box office and closed on 19 December 1953, after 138 performances. Terry-Thomas then reprised his role of Idle Jack for a run of performances in the Granada theatres of Sutton and Woolwich, and the Finsbury Park Empire, which ran to the end of January 1954. That year, he separated from Patlanski following an increase in domestic tension and the plethora of affairs in which they had both indulged. Patlanski moved out of the shared home, and the couple lived separate lives; the press did not report the separation until 1957.

Terry-Thomas spent the 1954 summer season performing at the Winter Gardens Pavilion, Blackpool before starring in a second series of &quot;Top of the Town&quot;, which ran from October 1954 to February 1955. At the end of the series he appeared as Hubert Crone in the play &quot;Room for Two&quot;, which had a UK tour prior to a run at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London. The last stop on the UK tour was at the Brighton Hippodrome, where Terry-Thomas broke his arm on stage; he returned to the show five days later when the tour reached London. He later joked that &quot;the audience roared with laughter when I fell and made horrible faces, so much so that I considered breaking the other arm for an encore&quot;. The London run was not a success and the show closed after 48 performances.

===British film years: 1956–1961===

In February 1956 Terry-Thomas appeared on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, and chose two songs from his &quot;Technical Hitch&quot; routine as part of his selection. Later that year he appeared in his first major film roles: Charles Boughtflower in &quot;The Green Man&quot;, and Major Hitchcock, &quot;a charlatan military officer on the take&quot;, in &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot;, directed by the Boulting brothers. Terry-Thomas appeared in the latter film only briefly, with a total screen time of about ten minutes, but his biographer Graham McCann thought the actor &quot;came close to stealing the show from the central character&quot;, Windrush, played by Ian Carmichael. Terry-Thomas&#x27;s depiction of the character was not how he wished to play it: his desired choice was that of a &quot;silly-ass&quot; sergeant major, but the role was written as a strict, alcohol and prescription drug-dependent Army officer. He was initially disappointed with the role, and turned it down but, after being persuaded to accept it by his agent, he embraced its possibilities. One of his lines, delivered in his clipped upper class voice, was &quot;You&#x27;re an absolute shower&quot;, which became a catchphrase for him. The Boulting brothers were so impressed with Terry-Thomas&#x27;s performance that they signed him up to a five-film deal.

The first of the five films was &quot;Brothers in Law&quot;, in which Terry-Thomas played the spiv Alfred Green, a performance which was based on Sid Field&#x27;s characterisation in &quot;Piccadilly Hayride&quot;. Roy Boulting later recounted that one short scene with Terry-Thomas, Richard Attenborough and Ian Carmichael took 107 takes because of Terry-Thomas&#x27;s unfamiliarity with filming techniques; he initially struggled to hit his marks, or give his line and move on while still acting. Filming the scene took two days and Boulting described it as a &quot;unique experience for him, and had a wonderful after-effect&quot;. Following &quot;Brothers in Law&quot; he was cast as Romney Carlton-Ricketts in &quot;Blue Murder at St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; by producers Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, before again appearing for the Boulting brothers in the cameo role of a local policeman in &quot;Happy Is the Bride&quot;. Terry-Thomas starred in two further films in 1957. The first was as Bertrand Welch in &quot;Lucky Jim&quot;, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Kingsley Amis. Although Amis thought Terry-Thomas had been &quot;totally miscast as Bertrand, the posturing painter and leading shit&quot; of the book, the critic for &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; considered Terry-Thomas as being &quot;the nearest to a complete success&quot; in the film, in a portrayal that &quot;suggests possibilities for more serious roles&quot;. His final part of 1957 was Lord Henry Mayley in &quot;The Naked Truth&quot;; this brought him together with Peter Sellers for the first time; the two of them appeared frequently together over the next few years, in scenes in which Graham McCann considered that each actor&#x27;s performance &quot;highlight[ed] what was special about the other&quot;. During one scene Terry-Thomas was dumped in a near-freezing lake, and his health was affected for some time afterwards.
In 1958 Terry-Thomas received the first of his two film award nominations, the BAFTA Award for the &quot;Best British Actor in 1959&quot; for the part of Ivan in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film &quot;tom thumb&quot;. He later described the film as his second favourite; he appeared opposite Sellers for much of his screen time, and later said that &quot;my part was perfect, but Peter&#x27;s was bloody awful. He wasn&#x27;t difficult about it, but he knew it&quot;. Terry-Thomas was still suffering with poor health following the filming of &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; when he suffered an attack of lumbago; filming went on for 85 days during 1957–58, and he took painkillers to enable him to continue. The role was physically demanding, and required him to ride a horse, run long distances and fight a duel. He said he fought and ran &quot;just as [he] had seen Douglas Fairbanks Snr do in &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;&quot;. Towards the end of filming, Terry-Thomas went to a Christmas party at the Trocadero, where he drank champagne and took codeine tablets, and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. He considered the arresting policemen to have been rude, and &quot;their attitude made me extremely angry and when I get angry ... I just go completely off my nut&quot;. The case came to court on 14 March 1958 and his legal team from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer provided a medical report which showed Terry-Thomas had been on a course of prescription painkillers due to a gruelling filming schedule; along with inconsistencies in the arresting policemen&#x27;s notes, the case proved inconclusive and was dismissed. For much of the rest of 1958, Terry-Thomas appeared on stage at the London Palladium in &quot;Large as Life&quot;, alongside Harry Secombe, Eric Sykes and Hattie Jacques. He played one of the Three Musketeers in one sketch and had another turn called &quot;Filling the Gap&quot;; the show ran for a total of 380 performances between May and December 1958. He also released his first record, &quot;Strictly T-T&quot;, a collection of comic songs and sketches.

In 1959 Terry-Thomas published his first autobiography, &quot;Filling the Gap&quot;, named after his spot in &quot;Large as Life&quot;; he explained that &quot;everything that has been printed about me is lies. I&#x27;m not suggesting the writers were lying, I was&quot;. During the year he also appeared in two further Boultings brothers&#x27; films in their series of institutional satires, having appeared in the previous three. The first, in which he was joined again by Sellers, was &quot;Carlton-Browne of the F.O.&quot;, in which he played Cadogan de Vere Carlton-Browne, a character he described as being &quot;rubble from the nostrils up&quot;, &quot;a certain type of Englishman, the Englishman who reads &quot;The Times&quot; and no other newspaper. A brolly carrier. A squash player. A bowler hat wearer. White collar, stiff, of course&quot;. Film writer Andrew Spicer thought Terry-Thomas&#x27;s role &quot;was the quintessential upper-class &#x27;silly-ass&#x27;, a sad relic of a vanished world&quot;. The film was initially chosen as Britain&#x27;s entry for the 1959 Moscow International Film Festival until the Foreign Office petitioned the British Film Producers&#x27; Association for it to be withdrawn, considering that the Russians might consider the film to accurately portray British diplomatic behaviour.
Terry-Thomas&#x27;s final film with the Boulting brothers was &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot;, a post-war follow-up to &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot; with Terry-Thomas reprising the role of Major Hitchcock in an industrial setting, as the &quot;tetchily incompetent&quot; personnel manager. Many of the other cast members of &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot; also returned, including Attenborough, Carmichael and Dennis Price; they were joined by Peter Sellers, who took most of the plaudits from the critics, although Stanley Kauffmann, writing in &quot;The New Republic&quot; also delighted in Terry-Thomas&#x27;s &quot;finesse&quot; and &quot;extraordinary skill&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; retrospectively considered &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot; and &quot;Carlton-Browne of the F.O.&quot; to have been Terry-Thomas&#x27;s best works. His final film of 1959 was as William Delany Gordon in &quot;Too Many Crooks&quot;. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought Terry-Thomas provided &quot;some of the fieriest conniptions to be seen on the contemporary screen&quot;, going on to say the actor&#x27;s &quot;skill is exercised in demonstrating how magnificently and completely a mad-cap comedian can completely blow his top. His eyes flash, his lips curl, his sibilants whistle and he glares like a maniac&quot;. Filming took place during the daytime; in the evenings he appeared at the London Palladium, something he found trying on his nervous system.

In 1960 Terry-Thomas appeared as Raymond Delauney in &quot;School for Scoundrels&quot;, a film his biographer, Robert Ross, called &quot;the definitive screen presentation of his frightfully well-mannered, well-read and well-educated lounge lizard: T-T the man as T-T the film star&quot;. He again appeared opposite Ian Carmichael, and they were joined by Alastair Sim and Janette Scott. Michael Brooke, writing for the British Film Institute, thought Terry-Thomas was &quot;outstanding as a classic British bounder&quot;. CNN listed the performance among the top ten British villains, stating, &quot;generally found twirling his cigarette holder while charming the ladies — at least, when not swindling, cheating or behaving like an absolute rotter.&quot; Later the same year he appeared in &quot;Make Mine Mink&quot; as Major Albert Rayne, a veteran of the Second World War who forms a gang of mink coat thieves with his female co-lodgers. When he made an appearance at a screening of the film in Dalston, north-east London, he was presented with a white mink waistcoat by a local furrier.

In 1961 Terry-Thomas played Archibald Bannister in &quot;A Matter of WHO&quot;, which he described as &quot;my first (fairly) serious role&quot;. He was joined in the film by his cousin&#x27;s son Richard Briers, with Terry-Thomas noting that he provided &quot;no nepotic help&quot; in getting Briers the part. The film was not well received by the critics; an internal BBC memo described that in the UK the film was &quot;murdered by the critics&quot;, although it was &quot;something of a success&quot; in America. By this time Terry-Thomas had decided to stop being a stand-up comedian and compere and instead concentrate solely on making films. He stopped appearing on television and radio shows of his own, declaring &quot;it was the cinema for me and me for the cinema!&quot; Having accumulated considerable experience by appearing in British films, he decided to try Hollywood, and moved to America.

===Breaking into Hollywood: 1961–1965===
Terry-Thomas spent part of 1961 in America, filming the role of Professor Bruce Patterson in &quot;Bachelor Flat&quot;—his first Hollywood role—before flying to Gibraltar to film &quot;Operation Snatch&quot;, in which he teamed up with Lionel Jeffries. By the end of 1961 Terry-Thomas was appearing on radio, such as the December broadcast of &quot;The Bing Crosby Show&quot; and in guest spots on American television shows; he was frequently the subject of US newspaper interviews. In 1962 &quot;Bachelor Flat&quot; and &quot;Operation Snatch&quot; were both released, and were followed by two more films: a large-budget biopic from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer called &quot;The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm&quot;, in which Terry-Thomas shared his scenes with the American comedian Buddy Hackett, and &quot;Kill or Cure&quot;, in which he appeared with Sykes, a friend since they worked together in &quot;Large as Life&quot;.

On 1 February 1962 Terry-Thomas and Pat Patlanski divorced, having spent the previous eight years estranged. He had by then split from his mistress of the previous few years, Lorrae Desmond, who returned to Australia shortly afterwards and married a surgeon; Terry-Thomas resumed his bachelor lifestyle. The break-up with Desmond caused him great upset, and he sought solace with Belinda Cunningham, a 21-year-old whom he had met on holiday in Majorca two years previously. The couple began a romance, and married in August 1963 at Halstead Registry Office near Colchester, Essex. The following year she gave birth to their first son—Timothy Hoar—at the Princess Beatrice Hospital in London.
In 1962 Terry-Thomas was offered the role of Lt-Colonel J. Algernon Hawthorne in &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;, and turned down the opportunity before leaving for the UK. By the time his flight arrived in London he had changed his mind, so he telephoned producer Stanley Kramer from the airport to signal his acceptance, and &quot;popped back on a plane to be fitted for the part&quot; the same day. He was not comfortable with many of the other actors on set, later commenting that &quot;I was the only non-American, and I found it exhausting and embarrassing because they never relaxed. They were always &#x27;on&#x27;.&quot; One of the American stars was Spencer Tracy, whom Terry-Thomas considered &quot;an extra-special man&quot;; Tracy and Buster Keaton—who also appeared in the film—were described by Terry-Thomas as &quot;the only two people who ever produced in me this awe of greatness&quot;.

Later in 1963 he picked up his second film nomination, the Golden Globe for Best Comedy Actor for his portrayal of Spender in &quot;The Mouse on the Moon&quot;. He also tried his hand at production, with three 15-minute travelogues: &quot;Terry-Thomas in Tuscany&quot;, &quot;Terry-Thomas in the South of France&quot; and &quot;Terry-Thomas in Northern Ireland&quot;. He did not enjoy the producer&#x27;s role, complaining that &quot;for some extraordinary reason that I could never understand, everybody was always out to do the producer of any film whoever he was. I had to be on the watch the whole time&quot;. He worked consistently during 1963, appearing in television programmes on both sides of the Atlantic; these included &quot;Terry-Thomas&quot;, a one-off variety show on BBC Television in July that included Donald Sutherland.

In 1964 Terry-Thomas started filming the role of Charles Furbank in &quot;How to Murder Your Wife&quot;, a part which brought him £100,000, his largest fee to that point. He said it was his favourite to make, &quot;because I felt that I did a very good job&quot;. He enjoyed working with Jack Lemmon, the film&#x27;s star, partly because Lemmon would play jazz and sing while the scenes were being lit: the two became friends and Terry-Thomas was invited to Lemmon&#x27;s wedding. Throughout the rest of the year Terry-Thomas continued to appear on US television, again in &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, but also on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;An Hour with Robert Goulet&quot;, both on CBS; he also released another record, &quot;Terry-Thomas Discovers America&quot;, a collection of songs and sketches, described by &quot;Billboard&quot; as &quot;a &quot;funny&quot;, &quot;funny&quot; comedy masterpiece&quot;. His earlier record, &quot;Strictly T-T&quot;, was also released in the US.

Alongside &quot;How to Murder Your Wife&quot;, there were two further releases for Terry-Thomas in 1965: &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot;, in which he played the part of a mortician, and &quot;Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines&quot;. In the latter, he played Sir Percy Ware-Armitage, a character the film historian Andrew Spicer calls &quot;a cartoon version&quot; of his usual persona in a &quot;bloated mid-Atlantic comed[y]&quot;. In the film, Terry-Thomas appeared again with Sykes, an experience Sykes later described as magical. The roles of Ware-Armitage and his sidekick were written especially for Terry-Thomas and Sykes at the behest of the director Ken Annakin.

===European cinema: 1966–1970===

By the mid-1960s Terry-Thomas was tiring of the Hollywood lifestyle, and, during the latter half of the 1960s, he worked with European filmmakers, returning occasionally to the US when he was filming there. In one of his French-produced films, &quot;La Grande Vadrouille&quot;, he played Sir Reginald, a stranded Royal Air Force pilot travelling through occupied France with characters played by Bourvil and Louis de Funès. The film, released in 1966, held the record for highest box-office takings in France until 2004, and it remains &quot;one of the most popular films with television audiences in France&quot;. Terry-Thomas undertook a number of roles with the Italian cinema industry. For one of the Italian-produced films, the 1967 farce &quot;Arabella&quot;, he played four parts and used &quot;the help of wigs, moustaches and lashings of Max Factor&quot; to help achieve the different characterisations, which were all with the Italian actress Virna Lisi.

Although the European films allowed him to travel and gave him a constant source of income, he received bigger fees from his less-frequent engagements in US films, which he continued to appear in, joking that he &quot;knew the fat cheques in the pipe-line were endless&quot;. One of the bigger fees came with Gene Kelly&#x27;s 1967 film &quot;A Guide for the Married Man&quot;; he was disappointed by Kelly&#x27;s direction, later saying &quot;I found him a very prudish director, not as imaginative or experimental as I would have liked&quot;. Terry-Thomas had more time for the actress with whom he shared his short scene, Jayne Mansfield, commenting that &quot;I found her rather intelligent to talk to and felt quite shattered when I read about the gruesome car accident that killed her&quot;. An actress he had difficulties in working with was Doris Day: in the 1968 film &quot;Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?&quot;, which was produced by her husband Martin Melcher. Day would instruct Terry-Thomas how he should act in a scene (he would &quot;listen ... politely, then do it my own way, as if the conversation had never taken place&quot;). She would also launch into improvisations while filming; director Hy Averback would mimic a scissor action behind her back to signal to Terry-Thomas that the material would be duly cut from the final print. The result was a film that Geoff Mayer called &quot;limp&quot;, and Christopher Young described as &quot;such an uneven movie that misses so many opportunities for real comedy&quot;.
In 1967 Terry-Thomas met his long-time friend Denholm Elliott in Bel Air and the pair talked about Elliott&#x27;s new villa in Santa Eulària des Riu on the Spanish island of Ibiza. Terry-Thomas was intrigued by the possibility of a Mediterranean retreat and visited the island on the way to sing in the television special &quot;Monte Carlo: C&#x27;est La Rose&quot; (1968), a musical tour of Monte Carlo hosted by Princess Grace of Monaco. Although he initially struggled to find the right plot of ground for the right price, he eventually settled on an appropriate location; declaring he was &quot;allergic to architects&quot;, he designed the house himself. His former wife Pat moved to the nearby island of Majorca, and Terry-Thomas&#x27;s relationship with her became warm and friendly; Patlanski also had a firm friendship with Terry-Thomas&#x27;s wife.

In between films Terry-Thomas appeared on television on both sides of the Atlantic. In the US in March–April 1967 he was in &quot;The Five Daughters Affair&quot;, a two-part story in the TV series &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, and on 22 May he appeared on &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot;. On British television, in an episode of the &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; called &quot;The Old Campaigner&quot;, he played James Franklin-Jones, a salesman for a plastics company who was continually searching for love affairs while travelling on business. This character was &quot;yet another variation on his rakish cad persona&quot;, according to Mark Lewisohn. The episode was well-received, and a six-part series was commissioned that ran over December 1968 and January 1969. Although the series performed well in the ratings, a second series was not commissioned. In between the pilot and the series of &quot;The Old Campaigner&quot;, in April 1968, Terry-Thomas appeared on the British ITV network in a one-off variety special, &quot;The Big Show&quot;, which combined musical numbers and his urbane monologues. Robert Ross commented that Terry-Thomas &quot;seemed to delight in resurrecting his vintage sophisticated patter after years in movies ... the top raconteur was back where he belonged&quot;. In 1969 he again teamed up with Eric Sykes and director Ken Annakin for a joint Italian, French and British production &quot;Monte Carlo or Bust!&quot;. The film was &quot;the only copper-bottomed sequel to ... &quot;Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines&quot;&quot;, according to Richard Ross. Terry-Thomas played Sir Cuthbert Ware-Armitage, the &quot;thoroughly bad egg son of flying ace Sir Percy Ware-Armitage&quot;, his role in &quot;Those Magnificent Men&quot;. Terry-Thomas secured four other roles in minor films that year, including &quot;Arthur? Arthur!&quot; (which he joked had &quot;never been shown anywhere—as far as I know!&quot;), as well as on television in the UK, US and Australia.

The 1970s began well for Terry-Thomas; television appearances in the UK and US were augmented by filming for &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot;, which became what author Bruce Hallenbeck called a &quot;camp classic&quot;, despite being described by &quot;Time Out&quot; critic David Pirie, as &quot;the worst horror film made in England since 1945&quot;; the film was released in 1971. On 1 August 1970 Terry-Thomas made his second appearance on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;; his luxury item was a case of brandy, chosen because it lasted longer than champagne.

===Dealing with Parkinson&#x27;s: 1971–1983===

While appearing in &quot;Don&#x27;t Just Lie There, Say Something!&quot; at the Metro Theatre, Sydney in 1971, Terry-Thomas felt unwell and visited a doctor, who noticed his patient&#x27;s left hand was shaking slightly. The doctor suggested he visit a specialist on his return to the UK, who diagnosed him with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Fearing the condition would affect offers of work, Terry-Thomas did not make the news public, but as the symptoms began to manifest themselves in tremors, a shuffling gait, stooped posture and affected speech, he made the news known—partly to stop rumours of on-set drunkenness.

Terry-Thomas continued to work as much as possible, although—as the film historian Geoff Mayer pointed out—the situation &quot;reduced his film career to supporting roles and cameos&quot;. The lucrative voice-over role of Sir Hiss in the 1973 Walt Disney film &quot;Robin Hood&quot; was one notable part, while others were less well-known, such as &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot;, a film described by Richard Ross as a &quot;cornball terror&quot;, in which he starred with Curd Jürgens, Tom Baker and Denholm Elliott. He also continued to appear on television shows in both the US and UK, as well as advertisements, including appearing with June Whitfield for Birds Eye fish fingers, a series of vermouth advertisements filmed in Italy, and an award-winning series for Benson &amp; Hedges cigarettes, with Eric Sykes.

During the 1970s he starred in a series of low-budget British films, including two in 1975, &quot;Spanish Fly&quot;—called a &quot;gruesome smutfest&quot; by the writer Christopher Fowler—and &quot;The Bawdy Adventures of Tom Jones&quot;, described by the &quot;Film Review Digest&quot; as a &quot;cheap, crude, sexed-up rehash&quot; of the other film adaptations of Henry Fielding&#x27;s source novel.

In 1977 he starred in &quot;The Last Remake of Beau Geste&quot; and &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, the latter starring Peter Cook and Dudley Moore as Holmes and Watson; Terry-Thomas thought &quot;it was the most outrageous film I ever appeared in ... there was no magic ... it was bad!&quot; By then he had exhibited a decrease in bodily movement, a sign of how serious his condition had become. His distinctive voice had developed a softer tone and his posture was contorted. Between 1978 and 1980, he spent much time with medical consultants. Despite this he was offered a few engagements and was voted the most recognisable Englishman among Americans in a poll which also featured Laurence Olivier, Robert Morley and Wilfrid Hyde-White. As a result, he secured a lucrative advertising contract with the Ford Motor Company. Derek Jarman offered Terry-Thomas a role in his 1979 film &quot;The Tempest&quot;, but the actor was forced to pull out because of his deteriorating health.

Terry-Thomas undertook his final film role in 1980 in &quot;Febbre a 40!&quot;, a German-Italian co-production that was &quot;nondescript and barely screened&quot;, according to Robert Ross, and did not even have a theatrical release in its two domestic markets. He continued his involvement in the film industry, where he funded three films during the early 1980s (noted by Ross to be &quot;destined from the outset for B-picture status or straight-to-video exposure&quot;); he commented that &quot;I have made a loss of one hundred per cent&quot;. In 1982, with his condition worsening, Terry-Thomas appeared in two episodes of the BBC series &quot;The Human Brain&quot;, which examined his condition; his frank interview brought much public awareness of the disease and raised £32,000 for the Parkinson&#x27;s Disease Society. Privately, he was becoming more depressed; his London flat had been sold to provide badly needed funds, and his work offers were decreasing.

===Final years and death: 1983–1990===
By 1983, with his medical bills at £40,000 a year and no longer able to work, Terry-Thomas&#x27;s financial resources were dwindling. He and his wife sold their dream house and moved into the small cottage in Spain once owned by his former wife Pat Patlanski, which she left to him in her will on her death in June that year. Shortly afterwards he worked with ghostwriter Terry Daum on an autobiography, &quot;Terry-Thomas Tells Tales&quot;. Although the first draft was completed by late summer 1984, Terry-Thomas refused to release the manuscript and continued making alterations, but never completed his copyediting: the book was finally published after his death.

By 1984 Terry-Thomas was increasingly depressed by his condition and when he was interviewed that year, he admitted that &quot;one doctor said I&#x27;ve got about four more years to live. God forbid! I shall probably blow my brains out first&quot;. In 1987 the couple could no longer afford to live in Spain, so moved back to London. They lived in a series of rented properties before ending up in a three-room, unfurnished charity flat, where they lived with financial assistance from the Actors&#x27; Benevolent Fund. Richard Briers was one of his first visitors at the flat, and was shocked by the change he saw: &quot;Sitting there, motionless, he was just a mere shadow. A crippled, crushed, shadow. It was really bloody awful.&quot;

On 9 April 1989 the actor Jack Douglas and Richard Hope-Hawkins organised a benefit concert for Terry-Thomas, after discovering he was living in virtual obscurity, poverty and ill health. The gala, held at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, ran for five hours, and featured 120 artists with Phil Collins topping the bill and Michael Caine as the gala chairman. The show raised over £75,000 for Terry-Thomas and Parkinson&#x27;s UK. The funds from the charity concert allowed Terry-Thomas to move out of his charity flat and into Busbridge Hall nursing home in Godalming, Surrey. He died there on 8 January 1990, at the age of 78. The funeral service was held at St. John the Baptist Church, Busbridge, where the theme from &quot;Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines&quot; was played; he was cremated at Guildford Crematorium.

==Screen persona and technique==
Although there were exceptions, Terry-Thomas&#x27;s screen characters were generally similar; Geoff Mayer wrote that &quot;although there would be variations, he would remain the &#x27;rotter&#x27;, a pretentious, elitist, seedy, sometimes lecherous cad with an eye for quick money and the easy life&quot;. Eric Sykes, with whom Terry-Thomas shared a number of screen moments, said it was &quot;always the same character and always funny&quot;. Andrew Spicer, writing for the British Film Institute, called him &quot;the definitive postwar cad or rotter&quot;. Terry-Thomas himself agreed with the view he presented, writing in the 1980s that &quot;T-T with his permanent air of caddish disdain ... bounder ... aristocratic rogue ... upper-class English twit ... genuine English eccentric ... one of the last real gentlemen ... wet, genteel Englishman ... high-bred idiot ... cheeky blighter ... camel-haired cad ... amiable buffoon ... pompous Englishman ... twentieth-century dandy ... stinker ... king of the cads ... All those descriptions added up to my image as Terry-Thomas&quot;.
Terry-Thomas identified himself as a comedy actor, but regarded himself &quot;first and foremost, as a comedian with a built-in ability to inject humour into situations&quot;. He worked hard at the humour element, especially during his days in cabaret and revue; he wrote that he &quot;spent an enormous amount of time studying how to write humour and reading books on the philosophical approach to it, but it didn&#x27;t get me very far. I decided that humour was like a good watch. It would go well if left to do its job but the moment one started poking around, it went wonky&quot;. While working on his television series &quot;How do you View?&quot;, he would change lines around to ensure the scene worked well, even if he gave the best lines to others; it was a quality which was appreciated by a number of others, including Jack Lemmon, who appeared with Terry-Thomas in &quot;How to Murder Your Wife&quot;. Lemmon commented that &quot;like most really good professionals he was generous to fellow actors. He worked with you, not at you&quot;.

Before starting filming or making an entrance on stage, Terry-Thomas had a routine he would undertake: &quot;my own technique to get myself going was ... to jump in the air and execute a few dance steps&quot;. His approach for much of his film work was to underplay many of his reactions. Filming a scene in a cinema in &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot;, a close-up was needed showing his character &quot;registering shock, fury, indignation and anything else I could stuff in&quot;; he &quot;just looked into the camera and kept my mind blank. It&#x27;s a trick I&#x27;ve used often since. In this way, the audience does the work&quot;. Terry-Thomas said &quot;I like to do my own stunts&quot;, which he did for films such as &quot;A Matter of WHO&quot; and &quot;Bachelor Flat&quot;. This included some dangerous work; for example, during &quot;Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines&quot;, he ran along the roof of a moving train.

==Legacy and reputation==

Following Terry-Thomas&#x27;s death, Lionel Jeffries called him &quot;the last of the great gentlemen of the cinema&quot;, while the director Michael Winner commented that &quot;no matter what your position was in relation to his, as the star he was always terribly nice. He was the kindest man and he enjoyed life so much&quot;. Reviewing his career in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Adrian Turner considered that &quot;we took him for granted and he was ideal for his time. Not to put too serious a point on it, his portrayal of crass stupidity and blatant deviousness struck a chord with British audiences during the fifties as they experienced the clumsy dismemberment of the Empire and the &#x27;never had it so good&#x27; ethos of the Macmillan era. During the sixties he became a glorious anachronism, much in demand in America, who saw in him the irrelevant pageantry of Britain&quot;; he also said Terry-Thomas was &quot;a national treasure&quot;. Gilbert Adair, writing in &quot;The Independent&quot;, considered that &quot;for three decades, and in literally scores of films, he personified the Englishman as amiable bounder&quot;; Adair wrote that &quot;the characterisation he was to assume represented the very essence of patrician, double-barrelled caddishness&quot;. Terry-Thomas&#x27;s friend Jack Lemmon called him &quot;a consummate professional ... he was a gentleman, a delight to be with personally, let alone professionally, and above all as an actor he had one of the qualities that I admire so much—he made it look simple&quot;.

Terry-Thomas&#x27;s image of an English cad was used by others. The personification started in the 1960s when the voice actor Ivan Owen, who had worked alongside Terry-Thomas in &quot;Stars in Battledress&quot;, based the voice for Basil Brush on that of Terry-Thomas, in a characterisation which also copied Terry-Thomas&#x27;s &quot;penchant for bad, self-satisfied, golf-club-bore jokes&quot;. The 1960s also witnessed the fictional cartoon character Dick Dastardly in two Hanna-Barbera cartoon series (&quot;Wacky Races&quot; and &quot;Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines&quot;), who was inspired by Terry-Thomas.

Other actors have used Terry-Thomas&#x27;s persona as an inspiration for their characters: Dustin Hoffman acknowledged that he based his interpretation of Captain Hook in &quot;Hook&quot; on him; Rupert Everett disclosed that when he provided the voice for Prince Charming in &quot;Shrek 2&quot; Terry-Thomas &quot;was vocally my role model while I was doing it&quot;; and Paul Whitehouse&#x27;s character, the 13th Duke of Wybourne, from &quot;The Fast Show&quot; was also modelled on Terry-Thomas&#x27;s on-screen persona. Mark Ruffalo listed Terry-Thomas as one of the inspirations for his performance as Duncan Wedderburn in &quot;Poor Things&quot;.

Terry-Thomas&#x27;s popularity continued after his death. In February 1999 the National Film Theatre ran a season of his films; an NFT spokesman described how attendees turned up &quot;in evening dress, with false moustaches and carrying cigarettes in long holders ... everyone has been trying to steal the cardboard cutouts of Terry ... We&#x27;ve never had a response like it. To be honest, we are rather unprepared. Nobody expected Terry-Thomas Fever&quot;.

Some of the innovations Terry-Thomas brought into his earlier television programmes were later copied by others; &quot;How Do You View?&quot; provided the &quot;prologue&quot; format of &quot;Up Pompeii!&quot;, and was the first to use regular BBC announcers as foils in comic sketches—a practice continued later, particularly with the shows of Morecambe and Wise. Terry-Thomas&#x27;s anecdotes, stringing several stories together, later inspired Ronnie Corbett in his monologue spot in his series &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;. In 2014, BBC Radio 4 broadcast &quot;Memories of a Cad&quot;, a comedy drama by Roy Smiles about the relationship between Terry-Thomas and Richard Briers, played by Martin Jarvis and Alistair McGowan respectively.

<doc id="241510" wikidata="Q785272" url="?curid=241510" title="Phi phenomenon">
<text>The term phi phenomenon is used in a narrow sense for an apparent motion that is observed if two nearby optical stimuli are presented in alternation with a relatively high frequency. In contrast to beta movement, seen at lower frequencies, the stimuli themselves do not appear to move. Instead, a diffuse, amorphous shadowlike something seems to jump in front of the stimuli and occlude them temporarily. This shadow seems to have nearly the color of the background. Max Wertheimer first described this form of apparent movement in his habilitation thesis, published 1912, marking the birth of Gestalt psychology.

In a broader sense, particularly if the plural form &quot;phi phenomena&quot; is used, it applies also to all apparent movements that can be seen if two nearby optical stimuli are presented in alternation. This includes especially beta movement, which has been regarded as the illusion of motion in cinema and animation, although it can be argued that beta movement indicates long-range apparent motion rather than the short-range apparent motion seen in film. Actually, Wertheimer applied the term &quot;φ-phenomenon&quot; to all apparent movements described in his thesis when he introduced the term in 1912, the objectless movement he called &quot;pure φ&quot;. Nevertheless, some commentators assert that he reserved the Greek letter φ for pure, objectless movement.

== Experimental demonstration ==

Wertheimer&#x27;s classic experiments used two light lines or curves repeatedly presented one after the other using a tachistoscope. If certain, relatively short, intervals between stimuli were used, and the distance between the stimuli was suitable, then his subjects (who happened to be his colleagues Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffka) reported seeing pure &quot;objectless&quot; motion.

However, it turns out to be difficult to demonstrate phi stably and convincingly. To facilitate demonstrating the phenomenon, 21st-century psychologists designed a more vivid experimental arrangement using more than two stimuli. In this demonstration, called &quot;Magni-phi,&quot; identical disks are arranged in a circle and, in a rapid sequence, one of the disks is hidden in clockwise or counter-clockwise order. This makes it easier to observe the kind of shadow-like movement Wertheimer discovered. The Magni-phi demonstration is robust to changes of parameters such as timing, size, intensity, number of disks, and viewing distance.

Furthermore, the phenomenon may be observed more reliably even with only two elements if a negative interstimulus interval (ISI) is used (that is, if the periods during which the two elements are visible overlap slightly). In that case, the viewer may see the two objects as stationary and suppose unconsciously that the reappearance of the stimulus on one side means that the object previously displayed in that position has reappeared and not, as observed with beta movement, that the object from the opposite side has just moved to a new position. The crucial factor for this perception is the shortness of discontinuity of the stimulus on each side. This is supported by the observation that two parameters have to be chosen properly to produce the pure phi phenomenon: first the absolute duration of the gap on each side must not exceed about 150 ms., and second, the duration of the gap must not exceed 40% of the stimulus period.

== History of research ==
In his 1912 thesis, Wertheimer introduced the symbol φ (phi) in the following way:
Besides the &quot;optimal movement&quot; (later called beta movement) and partial movements of both objects, Wertheimer described a phenomenon he called &quot;pure movement.&quot; Concerning this, he summarized the descriptions of his test subjects as follows:
Wertheimer attributed much importance to these observations because, in his opinion, they proved that movement could be perceived directly and was not necessarily deduced from the separate sensation of two optical stimuli in slightly different places at slightly different times. This aspect of his thesis was an important trigger in launching Gestalt psychology.

Starting in the mid-20th century, confusion arose in the scientific literature as to exactly what the phi phenomenon was. One reason could be that the anglophone scientists had difficulties understanding Wertheimer&#x27;s thesis, which was published in German. Wertheimer&#x27;s writing style is also idiosyncratic. Furthermore, Wertheimer&#x27;s thesis does not specify precisely under which parameters &quot;pure movement&quot; was observed. Moreover, it is difficult to reproduce the phenomenon. Edwin Boring&#x27;s influential history of the psychology of sensation and perception, first published in 1942, contributed to this confusion. Boring listed the phenomena Wertheimer had observed and sorted them by the length of the interstimulus interval. However, Boring placed the phi phenomenon in the wrong position, namely as having a relatively long inter stimulus interval. In fact, with such long intervals, subjects do not perceive movement at all; they only observe two objects appearing successively.

This confusion has probably contributed to the &quot;rediscovery&quot; of the phi phenomenon under other names, for example, as &quot;omega motion,&quot; &quot;afterimage motion,&quot; and &quot;shadow motion.&quot;

== Reverse phi illusion ==
As apparent phi movement is perceived by human’s visual system with two stationary and similar optical stimuli presented next to each other exposing successively with high frequency, there is also a reversed version of this motion, which is reversed phi illusion. Reverse phi illusion is the kind of phi phenomenon that fades or dissolves from its positive direction to the displaced negative, so that the apparent motion human perceive is opposite to the actual physical displacement. Reverse phi illusion is often followed by black and white patterns.

It is believed that reverse phi illusion is indeed brightness effects, that it occurs when brightness-reversing picture moving across our retina. It can be explained by mechanisms of visual receptive field model, where visual stimuli are summated spatially (a process that is reverse to spatial differentiation). This spatial summation blurs the contour to a small extent, and thus changes the brightness perceived. Four predictions are confirmed from this receptive field model. First, foveal reverse-phi should be broken down when the displacement is greater than the width of foveal receptive fields. Second, reverse phi illusion exists in the peripheral retina for greater displacements than in the fovea, for receptive fields are greater in the peripheral retina. Third, the spatial summation by the receptive fields could be increased by the visual blurring of the reversed phi illusion projected on a screen with defocus lens. Fourth, the amount of reversed phi illusion should be increasing with the decrease of displacement between positive and negative pictures.

Indeed, our visual system processes forward and reversed phi phenomenon in the same way. Our visual system perceives phi phenomenon between individual points of corresponding brightness in successive frames, and phi movement is determined on a local, point-for-point basis mediated by brightness instead of on a global basis.

=== Neural mechanism underlying sensitivity to reversed phi phenomenon ===

* T4 and T5 motion detectors cells are necessary and sufficient for reversed phi behavior, and there are no other pathways to produce turning responses for reversed phi motion. 
* Tangential cells show partial voltage response with the stimulation of reversed phi motion. 
* Hassenstein-Reichardt detector model. 
* There is substantial responses for reversed-phi in T4 dendrites, and marginal responses in T5 dendrites. 

== Phi phenomenon and beta movement ==

Phi phenomenon has long been confused with beta movement; however, the founder of Gestalt School of Psychology, Max Wertheimer, has distinguished the difference between them in 1912. While Phi phenomenon and Beta movement can be considered in the same category in a broader sense, they are quite distinct indeed.

Firstly, the difference is on neuroanatomical level. Visual information is processed in two pathways, one processes position and motion, and the other one processes form and color. If an object is moving or changing position, it would be likely to stimulate both pathways and result in a percept of beta movement. Whereas if the object changes position too rapidly, it might result in a percept of pure movement such as phi phenomenon.

Secondly, phi phenomenon and beta movement are also different perceptually. For phi phenomenon, two stimuli A and B are presented successively, what you perceive is some motion passing over A and B; while for beta movement, still with two stimuli A and B presented in succession, what you perceive would be an object actually passing from position A to position B.

The difference also lies on cognitive level, about how our visual system interprets movement, which is based on the assumption that visual system solves an inverse problem of perceptual interpretation. For neighboring stimuli produced by an object, the visual system has to infer the object since the neighboring stimuli do not give the complete picture of the reality. There are more than one way for our visual system to interpret. Therefore, our visual system needs to put constraints to multiple interpretations in order to acquire the unique and authentic one. Principles employed by our visual system to set the constraints are often relevant to simplicity and likelihood.

== Hassenstein–Reichardt detector model ==

The Hassenstein–Reichardt detector model is considered to be the first mathematical model to propose that our visual system estimates motion by detecting a temporal cross-correlation of light intensities from two neighboring points, in short a theoretical neural circuit for how our visual system track motion. This model can explain and predict phi phenomenon and its reversed version. This model consists two locations and two visual inputs, that if one input at one location is detected, the signal would be sent to the other location. Two visual inputs would be asymmetrically filtered in time, then the visual contrast at one location is multiplied with the time-delayed contrast from the other location. Finally, the multiplication result would be subtracted to obtain an output.

Therefore, two positive or two negative signals would generate a positive output; but if the inputs are one positive and one negative, the output would be negative. This corresponds to the multiplication rule mathematically.

For phi phenomenon, motion detector would develop to detect a change in light intensities at one point on the retina, then our visual system would compute a correlation of that change with a change in light intensities of a neighboring point on the retina, with a short delay.

=== Reichardt model ===
The Reichardt model is a more complex form of the simplest Hassenstein–Reichardt detector model, which is considered to be a pairwise model with a common quadratic nonlinearity. As Fourier method is considered to be linear method, Reichardt Model introduces multiplicative nonlinearity when our visual responses to luminance changes at different element locations are combined. In this model, one photoreceptor input would be delayed by a filter to be compared by the multiplication with the other input from a neighboring location. The input would be filtered two times in a mirror-symmetrical manner, one before the multiplication and one after the multiplication, which gives a second-order motion estimation. This generalized Reichardt model allows arbitrary filters before the multiplicative nonlinearity as well as filters post-nonlinearity. Phi Phenomenon is often regarded as first-order motion, but reversed phi could be both first-order and second-order, according to this model.

<doc id="241512" wikidata="Q1004005" url="?curid=241512" title="Frindle">
<text>Frindle is a middle-grade American children&#x27;s novel written by Andrew Clements, illustrated by Brian Selznick, and published by Aladdin Paperbacks in 1996. It was the winner of the 2016 Phoenix Award, which is granted by the Children&#x27;s Literature Association annually to recognize one English-language children&#x27;s book published twenty years earlier that did not win a major literary award at the time of publication.

&quot;Frindle&quot; was Clements&#x27;s first novel; all of his previous works had been picture books. According to Clements, the book originated from the thought, &quot;What would happen if a kid started using a new word, and other kids really liked it, but his teacher didn&#x27;t?&quot;

==Plot==
Nicholas &quot;Nick&quot; Allen is a class clown who has been formulating creative schemes throughout grade school. At the start of fifth grade in 1987, he is unhappy because his English teacher is the no-nonsense Mrs. Granger. One day, in an attempt to forestall, Nick decides to question Mrs. Granger on where each word in the dictionary comes from. This backfires, as Mrs. Granger assigns him an essay about it. From this experience, Nick learns that individuals get to determine what words mean, and when he comes across a gold-colored pen in the street, he decides to give a &quot;pen&quot; a new name: &quot;frindle&quot;.

Nick&#x27;s classmates like the idea and soon, every child in the fifth grade starts using the word &quot;frindle&quot;. Mrs. Granger makes any students who are caught saying &quot;frindle&quot; stay after school and write lines, but this proves to be a problem, as this causes almost every student to stay after school. The school principal decides to visit Nick&#x27;s house to end the use of &quot;frindle&quot;, but the situation is beyond Nick&#x27;s personal control, and the word&#x27;s usage cannot be curtailed. &quot;Frindle&quot; starts to gain national attention, and a family friend purchases the merchandising rights to the word. The word &quot;frindle&quot; spreads across the nation, and Nick thinks through the trouble that this one scheme has caused.

In the epilogue, Nick is a young adult. Mrs. Granger sends him a new copy of the dictionary, recently updated to include new words, including the word &quot;frindle&quot;. She includes a letter, in which she explains that she intentionally stood against the word in order to make it more popular. Nick sends back a present — the frindle that started it all, engraved with the words, &quot;This object belongs to Mrs. Lorelei Granger, and she may call it any name she chooses.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
The U.S. National Education Association named &quot;Frindle&quot; one of &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot; based on a 2007 online poll.

In 2012, it was ranked number 38 among all-time children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, a monthly with a primarily U.S. audience.
The book has received more than 35 awards and honors, including among other schoolchildren&#x27;s choice awards:

*Judy Lopez Memorial Honor Book (L.A.), Award 97
*1998–99 Maud Hart Lovelace Award, MN Youth Rdg. Award
*Prize Cento, 1998, Cento, Italy
*Year 1999 Young Hoosier Book Award
* 2016 Phoenix Award

==Sequel==
&quot;The Frindle Files&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Frindle&quot; and set a generation after the first book, was published posthumously by Random House on August 27, 2024. The cover art was created by Clements&#x27; longtime collaborator Brian Selznick.

==Film adaptation==
In 2015, it was announced that a film adaptation was in development with Mike Karz and Bill Bindley producing and Sam Harper penning the script. Susan Sarandon signed on to portray Mrs. Lorelei Granger. , no further development has been announced.

<doc id="241513" wikidata="Q935895" url="?curid=241513" title="Incitatus">
<text>Incitatus (; meaning &quot;swift&quot; or &quot;at full gallop&quot;) was the favourite horse of Roman Emperor Caligula (). According to legend, Caligula planned to make the horse a consul, although ancient sources are clear that this did not occur. Supposedly, Incitatus had 18 servants for himself, he lived in a marble stable, walked in a harness decorated with rare and special stones/jewels, dressed in purple (the colour of royalty) and ate from an ivory manger.

==Legend==
According to Suetonius, in the &quot;Lives of the Twelve Caesars&quot; (121 AD), Caligula planned to make Incitatus a consul, and the horse would &quot;invite&quot; dignitaries to dine with him in a house outfitted with servants there to entertain such events. Suetonius also wrote that the horse had a stable of marble, with an ivory manger, purple blankets and a collar of precious stones. 

Cassius Dio (165–235 AD) indicated that the horse was attended by servants and was fed oats mixed with gold flake, and that Caligula made the horse a priest.

==Historical accuracy==
The accuracy of the received history is generally questioned. Historians such as Anthony A. Barrett suggest that later Roman chroniclers such as Suetonius and Dio Cassius were influenced by the political situation of their own times, when it may have been useful to the current emperors to discredit the earlier Julio-Claudian emperors. Also, the lurid nature of the story added spice to their narratives and won them additional readers.

Scholars suggest that the treatment of Incitatus by Caligula was an elaborate prank intended to ridicule and provoke the Senate, rather than a sign of insanity, or was perhaps a form of satire with the implication that a horse could perform a senator&#x27;s duties.

Barrett noted, &quot;Many stories were spread about Incitatus, originating most likely from Caligula&#x27;s own humorous quips... [p]ossibly out of perverted sense of humor Caligula would pour libations to Incitatus&#x27; &quot;salus&quot; [health and well-being], and claimed that he intended to co-opt him as his priest.&quot;

Ancient sources are clear that the horse was never made a consul.

==In art and metaphor==
* Incitatus has for centuries been an allegorical figure when referencing examples of political ineptitude, going back at least to 1742.
* In Act III of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; (1904), Pishchik says that his family is &quot;descended from that very nag Caligula inducted into the Senate.&quot;
* Aleister Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Liber VII&quot; Chapter 4, v. 28–30, suggest Incitatus had a deeper significance, reading, &quot;Who wast Thou, O Caesar, that Thou knewest God in an horse? For lo! we beheld the White Horse of the Saxon engraven upon the earth; and we beheld the Horses of the Sea that flame about the old grey land, and the foam from their nostrils enlightens us!&quot;
* The life of Incitatus is the subject of Zbigniew Herbert&#x27;s poem &quot;Caligula&quot; (in &quot;Pan Cogito&quot;, 1974).
* In &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, Robert Graves wrote that Incitatus was made a senator and was put on the list to become a consul; that eventually, Claudius removed the governmental stipend for Incitatus and his status as senator for lacking the monetary requirements; that later, Incitatus was slaughtered after injuring his leg at a race; and that the mate of Incitatus, Penelope, was used by Claudius during his war with Britain.
*In the 1957 Ayn Rand novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, a mention of Incitatus is overheard by the newly wed wife of James Taggart, Cherryl. She overhears the conversation of two men apparently discussing her wedding and her husband. 
* The 2000 BBC Radio 4 comedy &quot;Me and Little Boots&quot;, by Shaun McKenna, told the story of Caligula (Latin for &quot;little boots&quot;) from the point of view of Incitatus, who was played by Leslie Phillips.
* In the 2006–2011 comic &quot;Jack of Fables&quot;, Incitatus talks so much that he risks giving away his status as a fable and frequently mentions his former status as a Roman senator.
* The progressive metal band Caligula&#x27;s Horse is named after Incitatus.
* The 2018 novel &quot;The Burning Maze&quot; by Rick Riordan presents Incitatus as a secondary antagonist.

<text>Worzel Gummidge is a scarecrow in British children&#x27;s fiction, who originally appeared in a series of books by the English novelist Barbara Euphan Todd. It was the first story book published by Puffin Books.

The books have been adapted for radio and television a number of times. Frank Atkinson was the first person to play the role in the 1953 BBC children&#x27;s television series &quot;Worzel Gummidge Turns Detective&quot;. Former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actor Jon Pertwee took the lead role from 1979 to 1981 in &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot;, produced by Southern Television for ITV in the UK. Pertwee reprised the role later in a New Zealand version (1987–1989). For the Pertwee series, the character had a set of interchangeable turnip, mangelwurzel and swede heads, each of which suited a particular occasion or endowed him with a specific skill.

In 2019 the character returned to the screen in the BBC series &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot; starring Mackenzie Crook in the title role.

==Outline==
Worzel Gummidge is a scarecrow that can come to life on Scatterbrook Farm. He stands in a ten-acre field, and befriends John and Susan who came to stay during the school holidays on the Braithwaites&#x27; farm. Worzel normally lands John and Susan in trouble when he is being mischievous, as he goes into a sulk and becomes a normal lifeless scarecrow. This leads others to blame the two children for the trouble he causes.

The &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot; books differ from the television adaption, one difference being that in the books Worzel is married to Earthy Mangold. In the first book, Aunt Sally (his femme fatale in the TV series) is only mentioned in one chapter and the character is an antagonistic bully to Worzel. For the television adaptation, Worzel has a collection of interchangeable heads. In the books, the maker of Worzel Gummidge and other scarecrows is not named the Crowman, but is described as a mysterious figure.

The first paperback version of the first book, released in 1941, has the distinction of being the first story book published by the famous children&#x27;s imprint Puffin.

==Adaptations==

===&quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;===

The first broadcast with Worzel was before World War II on the BBC&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Hour. By 1946, Worzel was played by veteran radio actor Philip Wade, John by John Clark, Susan by Rosamund Barnes, and Earthy Mangold by Mabel Constanduros. Later, Worzel was played by Denis Folwell, who went on to play Jack Archer in the long-running BBC radio 4 soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot;.

===&quot;Worzel Gummidge Turns Detective&quot;===

The character first appeared on television in 1953 in a four-part series starring Frank Atkinson in the title role.

===&quot;Jackanory&quot;===

In July 1967 five &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot; stories were read on &quot;Jackanory&quot; by Gordon Rollings. &quot;Worzel Gummidge Again&quot; was read in November 1974 (with one story tying in with Guy Fawkes Night) by Geoffrey Bayldon, later to appear in the 1979-81 TV series.

===1979-81 television series===
Southern Television&#x27;s production for ITV was written by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall, and starred Jon Pertwee as Worzel, with Una Stubbs as Aunt Sally, a life-size fairground doll and Worzel&#x27;s femme fatale. This was a significant change from the original books, where Aunt Sally is, in fact, Worzel&#x27;s aunt. The Crowman, who made Worzel and some of his other scarecrow friends, was played by Geoffrey Bayldon (who read &quot;Worzel Gummidge Again&quot; in November 1974 on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Jackanory&quot;), better known for his starring role as the title character of &quot;Catweazle&quot;. Bill Maynard also appeared as a scarecrow called Sergeant Beetroot.

===&quot;Worzel Gummidge Down Under&quot;===
Television New Zealand and Channel 4 collaborated on a follow-up programme that ran for two series in 1987 and 1989, with Worzel Gummidge and Aunt Sally, still played by Pertwee and Stubbs, relocated to New Zealand.

===&quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot; (2019 adaptation)===
&quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot; is a 2019 British TV fantasy miniseries, and an adaptation of the &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot; series by Barbara Euphan Todd. It stars Mackenzie Crook, who also wrote and directed the series, as the magical scarecrow. It was produced by Leopard Pictures (part of the Argonon Group) and was broadcast by BBC One on 26 and 27 December 2019. A further four episodes followed in 2020 and 2021.

<doc id="241517" wikidata="Q661566" url="?curid=241517" title="Dutch Golden Age">
<text>The Dutch Golden Age ( ) was a period in the history of the Netherlands which roughly lasted from 1588, when the Dutch Republic was established, to 1672, when the &quot;Rampjaar&quot; occurred. During this period, Dutch trade, scientific developments, art and overseas colonisation was among the most prominent in Europe. The first half of the period spanned from the beginning of the Eighty Years&#x27; War until its conclusion in 1648, with the second half lasting until the outbreak of the Franco-Dutch War. During the period, Dutch colonialists, many of them affiliated with the East India Company and West India Company, established trading posts and colonies in the Americas, Southern Africa and Asia, protected by the powerful Dutch States Navy. The Dutch also dominated the triangular trade and Atlantic slave trade during this period.

Dutch culture experienced a renaissance during this period as well. However, by the end of the 17th century, conflicts with neighbouring powers as well as declining economic influence led to the end of this period. The process by which the Dutch Republic became one of the foremost maritime and economic powers of the world during the era has been referred to as the &quot;Dutch Miracle&quot; by historian K. W. Swart. The term &quot;Dutch Golden Age&quot; has been controversial in the 21st century due to the extensive Dutch involvement in slavery and colonialism during the period, and it has been deprecated by several museums in the Netherlands, including the Amsterdam Museum.

==Background==

In 1568, the Seven Provinces that later signed the Union of Utrecht () started a rebellion against Philip II of Spain that led to the Eighty Years&#x27; War. Before the Low Countries could be completely reconquered, a war between England and Spain, the Anglo-Spanish War of 1585-1604, broke out. English intervention forced Spanish troops to halt their advances and left them in control of the important trading cities of Bruges and Ghent, but without control of Antwerp, which was then arguably the most important port in the world. Antwerp fell on 17 August 1585, after a siege, and the division between the Northern and Southern Netherlands (the latter mostly modern Belgium) was established.

The United Provinces (roughly today&#x27;s Netherlands) fought on until the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce, which did not end the hostilities. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which ended the Eighty Years&#x27; War between the Dutch Republic and Spain, and the Thirty Years&#x27; War between other European powers, brought the Dutch Republic formal recognition and independence from the Spanish crown.

===Migration of skilled workers to the Dutch Republic===

Protestants were especially well-represented among the skilled craftsmen and rich merchants of the port cities of Bruges, Ghent, and Antwerp. Under the terms of the surrender of Antwerp in 1585, the Protestant population (if unwilling to reconvert) were given four years to settle their affairs before leaving the city and Habsburg territory. Similar arrangements were made in other places.

More Protestants moved to the north between 1585 and 1630 than Catholics moved in the other direction, although there were also many of these. Many of those moving north settled in Amsterdam, transforming what was a small harbor into one of the most important ports and commercial centres in the world by 1630.

In addition to the mass migration of Protestant natives from the southern Netherlands to the northern Netherlands, there were also influxes of non-native refugees who had previously fled from religious persecution, particularly Sephardi Jews from Portugal and Spain, and later Protestants from France. The Pilgrim Fathers also spent time there before their voyage to the New World.

===Protestant work ethic===

Economists Ronald Findlay and Kevin H. O&#x27;Rourke attribute part of the Dutch ascendancy to its Protestant work ethic based on Calvinism, which promoted thrift and education. This contributed to &quot;the lowest interest rates and the highest literacy rates in Europe. The abundance of capital made it possible to maintain an impressive stock of wealth, embodied not only in the large fleet but in the plentiful stocks of an array of commodities that were used to stabilize prices and take advantage of profit opportunities.&quot;

===Cheap energy sources===
Several other factors also contributed to the flowering of trade, industry, the arts and the sciences in the Netherlands during this time. A necessary condition was a supply of cheap energy from windmills and from peat, easily transported by canal to the cities. The invention of the wind powered sawmill enabled the construction of a massive fleet of ships for worldwide trading and for military defense of the republic&#x27;s economic interests.

===Corporate finance===
In the 17th century the Dutch – traditionally able seafarers and keen mapmakers – began to trade with the Far East, and as the century wore on, they gained an increasingly dominant position in world trade, a position previously occupied by the Portuguese and Spanish. The maps used by Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba to attack Dutch cities were made by Dutch mapmakers.

In 1602, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was founded. It was one of the first-ever multinational corporations, financed by shares that established the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. The company received a Dutch monopoly on Asian trade, which it would keep for two centuries, and it became the largest commercial enterprise of the 17th-century world. Spices were imported in bulk and brought huge profits due to the efforts and risks involved and to demand. This is remembered to this day in the Dutch word &quot;&quot;, (as expensive as pepper) meaning something is very expensive, reflecting the prices of spices at the time. To finance the growing trade within the region, the Bank of Amsterdam was established in 1609, the precursor to, if not the first true central bank.

Although the trade with the Far East was the more famous of the VOC&#x27;s exploits, the main source of wealth for the Republic was, in fact, its trade with the Baltic states and Poland (then the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). Called the &quot;Mothertrade&quot; (), the Dutch imported enormous amounts of bulk resources like grain and wood, stockpiling them in Amsterdam so Holland would never lack for basic goods, as well as being able to sell them on for profit. This meant that, unlike their main rivals, the Republic would not face the dire repercussions of a bad harvest and the starvation it accompanied, instead profiting when this happened in other states (bad harvests were commonplace in France and England in the 17th century, which also contributed to the Republic&#x27;s success in that time).

=== Geography ===
According to Ronald Findlay and Kevin H. O&#x27;Rourke, geography favored the Dutch Republic, contributing to its wealth. They write, &quot;The foundations were laid by taking advantage of location, midway between the Bay of Biscay and the Baltic. Seville and Lisbon and the Baltic ports were too far apart for direct trade between the two terminal points, enabling the Dutch to provide profitable intermediation, carrying salt, wine, cloth and later silver, spices, and colonial products eastward while bringing Baltic grains, fish, and naval stores to the west. The Dutch share of European shipping tonnage was enormous, well over half during most of the period of their ascendancy.&quot;

==Dutch Empire==

Outside of Europe, the Republic also prospered. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) and the Dutch West India Company (WIC) not only obtained a monopoly on the spice trade, their ships also controlled the world&#x27;s seas. This was very much against the wishes of England, which was envious of the economic success of the Republic. Although they had both fought the Spanish during the Eighty Years War, the two countries were diametrically opposed when the Republic captured a large colonial empire. This led to the Anglo-Dutch Wars.

The prosperity gained from this was accompanied by horrors against the local population. For example, in 1621, Jan Pieterszoon Coen had almost all the inhabitants of the Banda Islands massacred, see Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands.

For a short time, the Republic seemed very successful in Brazil. The Dutch had succeeded in taking the coast between the mouth of the Amazon and the São Francisco (a river south of Recife) from the Portuguese. Under governor John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen (1637-1644), the lucrative sugar trade was largely in Dutch hands.

Curaçao was conquered in 1634. By 1648, Aruba and Bonaire were also in Dutch hands. A promising colony in North America was New Amsterdam (in present-day New York City).

The role that the Netherlands was able to play in the transatlantic slave trade was the result of a series of conquests against the Portuguese. Trade routes of African slaves in the seventeenth century ran largely through Elmina in Ghana to Brazil and the Caribbean Islands. Elmina was conquered in 1637, Axim in 1642. In 1641, led by Cornelis Jol, Angola was also conquered. It is estimated that more than 550,000 people were brought to America in slavery by Dutch ships. Conditions during these voyages were miserable, and it was commonplace for large numbers of enslaved people to die before they reached their destination. In addition to the personal hardships of enslaved people, the trade also massively disrupted African societies. Estimates of the direct profitability vary, but without slavery the colonization of the Americas would have looked very different.

Asian slaves were also traded extensively. The slave was indispensable in the economy of the Dutch colonial empire in the Golden Age as a labor force; in the second half of the seventeenth century, half of the inhabitants of Batavia were unfree.

==Monopoly on trade with Japan==

Amsterdam&#x27;s dominant position as a trade center was strengthened in 1640 with a monopoly for the Dutch East India Company (VOC) for trade with Japan through its trading post on Dejima, an island in the bay of Nagasaki. From here the Dutch traded between China and Japan and paid tribute to the &quot;shōgun&quot;. Until 1854, the Dutch were Japan&#x27;s sole window to the Western world.

The collection of scientific learning introduced from Europe became known in Japan as &quot;Rangaku&quot; or Dutch Learning. The Dutch were instrumental in transmitting to Japan some knowledge of the industrial and scientific revolution then occurring in Europe. The Japanese purchased and translated numerous scientific books from the Dutch, obtained from them Western curiosities and manufactures (such as clocks) and received demonstrations of various Western innovations (such as electric phenomena, and the flight of a hot air balloon in the early 19th century). In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch were arguably the most economically wealthy and scientifically advanced of all European nations, which put them in a privileged position to transfer Western knowledge to Japan.

==European great power==
The Dutch also dominated trade between European countries. The Low Countries were favorably positioned at a crossing of east–west and north–south trade routes and connected to a large German hinterland through the Rhine river. Dutch traders shipped wine from France and Portugal to the Baltic lands and returned with grain for countries around the Mediterranean Sea. By the 1680s, an average of nearly 1000 Dutch ships entered the Baltic Sea each year, to trade with markets of the fading Hanseatic League. The Dutch were able to gain control of much of the trade with the nascent English colonies in North America; and after the end of the war with Spain in 1648, Dutch trade with that country also flourished.

==Other industries==

National industries expanded as well. Shipyards and sugar refineries are prime examples. As more and more land was utilized, partially through transforming lakes into polders such as the Beemster, Schermer and Purmer, local grain production and dairy farming soared.

== Social structure ==
In the Netherlands in the 17th century, social status was largely determined by income. The landed nobility had relatively little importance, since they mostly lived in the more underdeveloped inland provinces, and it was the urban merchant class that dominated Dutch society. The clergy did not have much worldly influence either: the Catholic Church had been more or less suppressed since the onset of the Eighty Years&#x27; War with Spain. The new Protestant movement was divided, although exercising social control in many areas to an even greater extent than under the Catholic Church.

That is not to say that aristocrats were without social status. On the contrary, wealthy merchants bought themselves into the nobility by becoming landowners and acquiring a coat of arms and a seal. Aristocrats also mixed with other classes for financial reasons: they married their daughters to wealthy merchants, became traders themselves or took up public or military office. Merchants also started to value public office as a means to greater economic power and prestige. Universities became career pathways to public office. Rich merchants and aristocrats sent their sons on a so-called Grand Tour through Europe. Often accompanied by a private tutor, preferably a scientist himself, these young people visited universities in several European countries. This intermixing of patricians and aristocrats was most prominent in the second half of the century.

After aristocrats and patricians came the affluent middle class, consisting of Protestant ministers, lawyers, physicians, small merchants, industrialists and clerks of large state institutions. Lower status was attributed to farmers, craft and tradesmen, shopkeepers, and government bureaucrats. Below that stood skilled laborers, maids, servants, sailors, and other persons employed in the service industry.
At the bottom of the pyramid were &quot;paupers&quot;: impoverished peasants, many of whom tried their luck in a city as a beggar or day laborer.

Workers and laborers were generally paid better than in most of Europe, and enjoyed relatively high living standards, although they also paid higher than normal taxes. Farmers prospered from mainly cash crops needed to support the urban and seafaring population.

===Women&#x27;s roles===
The central role of women in the 17th-century Dutch household revolved around the home and domestic tasks. In Dutch culture, the home was regarded as a safe-haven from the lack of Christian virtue and immorality of the outside world. Additionally, the home represented a microcosm of the Dutch Republic, in that the smooth running of an ideal household reflected the relative stability and prosperity of the government. The home was an integral part of public life in Dutch society. Public passers-by could clearly view the entrance halls of Dutch homes decorated to show off a particular family&#x27;s wealth and social standing. The home was also a place for neighbors, friends, and extended family to interact, further cementing its importance in the social lives of 17th-century Dutch burghers. The physical space of the Dutch home was constructed along gender lines. In the front of the house, the men had control over a small space where they could do their work or conduct business, known as the Voorhuis, while women controlled most every other space in the house, such as the kitchens and private family rooms. Although there was a clear separation in spheres of power between husband and wife (the husband had authority in the public realm, the wife in the domestic and private), women in 17th-century Dutch society still enjoyed a wide range of freedoms within their own sphere of control. Unmarried young women were known to enjoy various freedoms with their lovers and suitors, while married women enjoyed the right to publicly shame their husbands who patronized brothels. Moreover, married women could legally reject the sexual desires of their husbands if there were proof or reason to believe that a sexual encounter would result in the transmission of syphilis or other venereal diseases. Dutch women were also allowed to take communion alongside men, and widows were able to inherit property and maintain control over their finances and husband&#x27;s wills. However, a woman&#x27;s sphere of authority still primarily lay in household duties, though historical evidence exists showing certain cases of wives maintaining considerable control in family businesses. Manuals written by men instructing women and wives in various aspects of domestic duties proliferated, the most popular being Jacob Cats&#x27; &quot;Houwelyck&quot;. As evidenced by numerous 17th-century Dutch genre paintings, the most important domestic tasks performed by women included supervising maids, cooking, cleaning, needlework, and spinning.

==== Unmarried women ====
As seen in art and literature at the time, unmarried young women were valued for maintaining their modesty and diligence as this time in a woman&#x27;s life was regarded to be the most precarious. From a young age, burgher women were taught various household-related duties by their mothers, including reading, so as to prepare them for their lives as housewives. Dutch art at this time shows the idealized situation in which an unmarried young girl ought to conduct herself in situations such as courtship, which commonly included themes relating to gardens or nature, music lessons or parties, needlework, and receiving love letters. However, ideals of the young women espoused by genre painting and Petrarchian poetry did not reflect the reality. Accounts from travellers described the various freedoms young women were provided in the realm of courtship. The prevalence of Calvinist sermons regarding the consequences of leaving young women unsupervised also spoke to a general trend of a lack of parental oversight in the matters of young love.

==== Married women and mothers ====
Dutch writers, such as Jacob Cats, held the prevailing public opinion concerning marriage. He and other cultural authorities were influenced by Calvinist ideals that stressed an equality between husband and wife, considered companionship a primary reason for marriage, and regarded procreation as a mere consequence of that companionship. However, non-egalitarian ideas still existed regarding women as the weaker sex, and the image of the turtle was commonly used to express the separate spheres and strengths of both genders. In addition to supervising maids, cooking, cleaning, and prating needlework, women were also encouraged to maintain some financial control over domestic affairs, such as going to market and buying their own food.

Maternity and motherhood were highly valued in Dutch culture. Mothers were encouraged to breastfeed their children, as using a wet nurse would prevent a bond from forming between mother and child. The Dutch believed that a mother&#x27;s milk came from the blood originally in her womb and that feeding the infant such substances would also reap physiological and health related benefits. Seventeenth-century Dutch society dictated that children should first begin to learn religion at home. Therefore, along with their husbands, women used family meal times to discuss religious topics and to focus on prayer.

==== Old women and widows ====
Seventeenth-century Dutch culture maintained contradictory attitudes regarding the elderly, in particular, elderly women. Some Dutch writers idealized old age as a poetic transition from life to death. Others regarded aging as an illness in which one is gradually deteriorating until they reach their final destination, while some lauded the elderly as wise and people who deserve the highest forms of respect. However, treatises on behaviour for elderly women and widows stressed not necessarily their inherent wisdom, but that they should maintain piety, practice moderation, and live a relatively secluded life. Unlike other European artistic traditions, Dutch art rarely depicts elderly women as disgusting or grotesque creatures, but rather they are idolized as figures of piety and purity whom the younger generations of women can look up to.

== Religion ==

Calvinism was the state religion in the Dutch Republic, though this does not mean that unity existed. Although the Netherlands was a tolerant nation compared to neighboring states, wealth and social status belonged almost exclusively to Protestants. The cities with a predominantly Catholic background, such as Utrecht and Gouda, did not enjoy the benefits of the Golden Age. As for the Protestant towns, unity of belief was also far from standard. At the beginning of the century bitter controversies between strict Calvinists and more permissive Protestants, known as Remonstrants, split the country. The Remonstrants denied predestination and championed freedom of conscience, while their more dogmatic adversaries (known as Contra-Remonstrants) gained a major victory at the Synod of Dort (1618–19). The variety of sects may well have worked to make religious intolerance impractical.

Renaissance Humanism, of which Desiderius Erasmus (c. 1466–1536) was an important advocate, had also gained a firm foothold and was partially responsible for a climate of tolerance.

Tolerance towards Catholics was not so easy to uphold, as religion had played an important part in the Eighty Years&#x27; War of independence against Spain (with political and economic freedom being other important motives). Intolerant inclinations, however, could be overcome by money. Thus Catholics could buy the privilege of holding ceremonies in a conventicle (a house doubling inconspicuously as a church), but public offices were out of the question. Catholics tended to keep to themselves in their own section of each town, even though they were one of the largest single denominations: for example, the Catholic painter Johannes Vermeer lived in the &quot;Papist corner&quot; of the town of Delft. The same applied to Anabaptists and Jews.

Overall, the country was tolerant enough to attract religious refugees from other countries, notably Jewish merchants from Portugal who brought much wealth with them. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in France in 1685 resulted in the immigration of many French Huguenots, many of whom were shopkeepers or scientists. However, some figures, such as the philosopher Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), experienced social stigma.

== Science ==

Due to its climate of intellectual tolerance, the Dutch Republic attracted scientists and other thinkers from all over Europe. In particular, the University of Leiden (established in 1575 by the Dutch stadtholder Willem van Oranje as a token of gratitude for Leiden&#x27;s fierce resistance against Spain during the Eighty Years&#x27; War) became a gathering place for intellectuals. Jan Amos Comenius, the Czech educator and writer, was known for his theories of education, but also as a pioneer of Czech Protestantism during the 17th century. To escape the Counter-Reformation, he migrated to the Dutch Republic and is buried in Naarden, North Holland. Comenius accepted the invitation of Laurens de Geer to visit Amsterdam, where he lived the last 14 years of his life (1656–1670). He published his most important works there: 43 volumes in all, about half of his total output. French philosopher and mathematician René Descartes (1596-1650) lived in Holland from 1628 until 1649. He also had his most important works published in Amsterdam and Leiden. Another French-born philosopher, Pierre Bayle, left France in 1681 for the Dutch Republic, where he became a professor of history and philosophy at the Illustrious School of Rotterdam. He lived in Rotterdam until his death in 1706. As Bertrand Russell noted in his &quot;A History of Western Philosophy&quot; (1945), &quot;He [Descartes] lived in Holland for twenty years (1629–49), except for a few brief visits to France and one to England, all on business. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of Holland in the 17th century, as the one country where there was freedom of speculation. Hobbes had to have his books printed there; Locke took refuge there during the five worst years of reaction in England before 1688; Bayle (of the &quot;Dictionary&quot;) found it necessary to live there; and Spinoza would hardly have been allowed to do his work in any other country.&quot;

Dutch lawyers were famous for their knowledge of international law of the sea and commercial law. Hugo Grotius (1583–1645) played a leading part in the foundation of international law. He invented the concept of the &quot;Free seas&quot; or &quot;Mare liberum&quot;, which was fiercely contested by England, the Netherlands&#x27; main rival for domination of world trade. He also formulated laws on conflicts between nations in his book &quot;De lure Belli ac pacis&quot; (&quot;On the law of war and peace&quot;).

Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) was a famous astronomer, physicist and mathematician. He invented the pendulum clock, which was a major step forward towards exact timekeeping. Among his contributions to astronomy was his explanation of Saturn&#x27;s planetary rings. He also contributed to the field of optics. The most famous Dutch scientist in the area of optics is Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who was the first to methodically study microscopic life—he was the first person to describe bacteria—thus laying the foundations for the field of microbiology. The &quot;microscopes&quot; were simple magnifiers, not compound microscopes. His skill in grinding lenses (some as small as 1mm in diameter) resulted in a magnification as high as 245x.

Famous Dutch hydraulic engineer Jan Leeghwater (1575–1650) gained important victories in the Netherlands&#x27; eternal battle against the sea. Leeghwater added a considerable amount of land to the republic by converting several large lakes into polders, pumping the water out with windmills.

== Culture ==
Cultural development in the Low Countries stood out from neighboring countries. With some exceptions (notably Dutch playwright Joost van den Vondel) the Baroque movement did not gain much influence. Its exuberance did not fit the austerity of the largely Calvinistic population. The major force behind new developments was the citizenry, notably in the western provinces: first and foremost in Holland, to a lesser extent Zeeland and Utrecht. Where rich aristocrats often became patrons of art in other countries, because of their comparative absence in the Netherlands this role was played by wealthy merchants and other patricians.

Centres of cultural activity were town militia (Dutch: &quot;schutterij&quot;) and chambers of rhetoric (&quot;rederijkerskamer&quot;). The former were created for town defence and policing, but also served as a meeting-place for the well-to-do, who were proud to play a prominent part and paid well to see this preserved for posterity by means of a group portrait. The latter were associations at a city level that fostered literary activities, like poetry, drama and discussions, often through contests. Cities took pride in their associations and promoted them.

In the Dutch Golden Age, the meals of the middle class consisted of a rich variety of dishes. During the 15th century haute cuisine began to emerge, largely limited to the aristocracy, but from the 17th century onward dishes of this kind became available to the wealthy citizens as well. The Dutch Empire enabled spices, sugar, and exotic fruits to be imported to the country. By the late 17th century, tea and coffee consumption were increasing and becoming part of everyday life. Tea was served with sweets, candy or marzipan and cookies. A rich Dutch mealtime of the time contained many extravagant dishes and drinks.

The elite wore black clothes as a status symbol. This status originated from the difficulty of the dyeing process and the cost of elaborate embellishments, and is contrary to the popular belief that it was done exclusively out of Puritan self-restraint.

=== Painting ===

Dutch Golden Age painting followed many of the tendencies that dominated Baroque art in other parts of Europe, such as Caravaggism and naturalism, but was the leader in developing the subjects of still life, landscape, and genre painting. Portraiture was also popular, but history painting – traditionally the most-elevated genre – struggled to find buyers. Church art was virtually non-existent, and little sculpture of any kind was produced. While art collecting and painting for the open market was also common elsewhere, art historians point to the growing number of wealthy Dutch middle-class and successful mercantile patrons as driving forces in the popularity of certain pictorial subjects.

This trend, along with the lack of Counter-Reformation church patronage that dominated the arts in Catholic Europe, resulted in the great number of &quot;scenes of everyday life&quot; or genre paintings, and other secular subjects. Landscapes and seascapes, for example, reflect the land reclaimed from the sea and the sources of trade and naval power that mark the Republic&#x27;s Golden Age. One subject that is quite characteristic of Dutch Baroque painting is the large group portrait, especially of civic and militia guilds, such as Rembrandt van Rijn&#x27;s &quot;Night Watch&quot;. A special genre of still life was the so-called pronkstilleven (Dutch for &#x27;ostentatious still life&#x27;). This style of ornate still-life painting was developed in the 1640s in Antwerp by Flemish artists such as Frans Snyders, Osias Beert, Adriaen van Utrecht and a whole generation of Dutch Golden Age painters. They painted still lifes that emphasized abundance by depicting a diversity of objects, fruits, flowers and dead game, often together with living people and animals. The style was soon adopted by artists from the Dutch Republic.

Today, the best-known painters of the Dutch Golden Age are the period&#x27;s most dominant figure Rembrandt, the Delft master of genre Johannes Vermeer, the innovative landscape painter Jacob van Ruisdael, and Frans Hals, who infused new life into portraiture. Some notable artistic styles and trends include Haarlem Mannerism, Utrecht Caravaggism, the School of Delft, the Leiden fijnschilders, and Dutch classicism.

=== Architecture ===


Dutch architecture was taken to a new height in the Golden Age. Cities expanded greatly as the economy thrived. New town halls, weighhouses and storehouses were built. Merchants who had made their fortune ordered a new house along one of the many new canals that were dug out in and around many cities (for defense and transport purposes), a house with an ornamented façade that befitted their new status. In the countryside, many new castles and stately homes were built; but most of them have not survived.

Early in the 17th century late Gothic elements still prevailed, combined with Renaissance motifs. After a few decades French classicism gained prominence: vertical elements were stressed, less ornamentation was used, and natural stone was preferred above bricks. In the last decades of the century this trend towards sobriety intensified. From around 1670 the most prominent feature of a house front was its entrance, with pillars on each side and possibly a balcony above it, but no further decoration.

Starting at 1595, Reformed churches were commissioned, many of which are still landmarks today.

The most famous Dutch architects of the 17th century were Jacob van Campen, Pieter Post, Philips Vingboons, Lieven de Key, and Hendrick de Keyser.

=== Sculpture ===
Dutch achievements in sculpture in the 17th century are less prominent than in painting and architecture, and fewer examples were created than in neighbouring countries, partly because of their absence in the interiors of Protestant churches, as objections to the Roman Catholic veneration of statues had been one of the contentious points of the Reformation. Another reason was the comparatively small class of nobles. Sculptures were commissioned for government buildings, private buildings (often adorning house fronts) and the exteriors of churches. There was also a market for grave monuments and portrait busts.

Hendrick de Keyser, who was active at the dawn of the Golden Age, is one of the few prominent home-grown sculptors. In the 1650s and 1660s, the Flemish sculptor Artus I Quellinus, along with his family and followers like Rombout Verhulst, were responsible for the classicizing decorations for the Amsterdam city hall (now the Royal Palace, Amsterdam). This remains the major monument of Dutch Golden Age sculpture.

=== Literature ===
The Golden Age was also an important time for developments in literature. Some of the major figures of this period were Gerbrand Bredero, Jacob Cats, Pieter Hooft, and Joost van den Vondel.

During this time, a climate of tolerance developed in comparison to other European states with strict censorship restrictions paving the way for the Dutch to become a powerhouse in the book trade. This transformation is described by modern historians as the &#x27;Dutch miracle.&#x27; Additionally, the Dutch enjoyed high literacy rates, and Dutch entrepreneurs took advantage of this. As a result, seventeenth-century Holland became a great centre for the production of news, Bibles, political pamphlets. Louis Elzevir and his descendants created what is considered one of the most eminent dynasties of the book trade. The House of Elzevir produced pocket editions of classical Latin texts which were scholarly, reliable, and reasonably priced. The Elzevir dynasty died out in 1712 and the &#x27;Dutch miracle&#x27; waned as international competition caught up to the Dutch book trade.

==Controversy==

The term &quot;Dutch Golden Age&quot; became a source of controversy during the 21st century due to the extensive Dutch involvement in slavery during this period; approximately 1.7 million people were enslaved by Dutch slavers from the 17th to 19th centuries as part of the Atlantic and Indian Ocean slave trades. In a 2019 exhibition at the Amsterdam Museum, the museum announced it would stop using the phrase, with its artistic director Margriet Schavemaker stating that &quot;the Golden Age is, in a way, the story of the winners, and it hides the colonial past of [the Netherlands]. It hides slavery, but also it covers up poverty more generally. Not everyone participated in the Golden Age, not at all.&quot; The museum&#x27;s announcement was met with criticism, including from Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and politician Michel Rog. In contrast, Curaçaoan activist and artist Quinsy Gario wrote that &quot;Most people [in the Netherlands] understand the Golden Age is a wrong term&quot;.

<doc id="241528" wikidata="Q374117" url="?curid=241528" title="Jacob Bronowski">
<text>Jacob Bronowski (18 January 1908 – 22 August 1974) was a Polish-British mathematician and philosopher. He is best known for developing a humanistic approach to science, and as the presenter and writer of the thirteen-part 1973 BBC television documentary series, and accompanying book, &quot;The Ascent of Man.&quot; He was widely regarded as &quot;one of the most revered intellectuals on the global stage.&quot;

Bronowski&#x27;s family moved from Congress Poland to Germany and then to England in 1920, when he was 12 years old. He won a scholarship to study mathematics at the University of Cambridge. His interests have been described as ranging &quot;widely, from biology to poetry and from chess to Humanism&quot;. He taught mathematics at University College Hull between 1934 and 1942. During World War II he led the field of operations research and worked to increase the effectiveness of Allied bombing. 

After the war he headed the projects division of UNESCO. Bronowski wrote poetry and had a deep affinity for William Blake. From 1950 to 1963 he worked for the National Coal Board in the UK. From 1963 he was a resident fellow of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, until his death in 1974 in East Hampton, New York, just a year after the airing of his &quot;Ascent of Man&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Jacob Bronowski was born to a Polish-Jewish family in Łódź, Congress Poland, in 1908. His family moved to Germany during the First World War, and to Britain in 1920, Bronowski&#x27;s parents having been married in Britain in the London house of his maternal grandfather in 1907. Although, according to Bronowski, he knew only two English words on arriving in Britain, he gained admission to the Central Foundation Boys&#x27; School in London and went on to study mathematics at the University of Cambridge, graduating as Senior Wrangler (best student mathematician) in 1930.

As a mathematics student at Jesus College, Cambridge, Bronowski co-edited – with William Empson – the literary periodical &quot;Experiment&quot;, which first appeared in 1928. Bronowski would pursue this sort of dual activity, in both the mathematical and literary worlds, throughout his professional life. He was also a strong chess player, earning a half-blue while at Cambridge and composing numerous chess problems for the &quot;British Chess Magazine&quot; between 1926 and 1970. He received a PhD in mathematics at Cambridge in 1935, writing a dissertation in algebraic geometry. For a time in the 1930s he lived near Laura Riding and Robert Graves in Majorca. From 1934 to 1942, he taught mathematics at the University College of Hull. Beginning in this period, the British secret service MI5 placed him under surveillance, believing he was a security risk, which may have restricted his access to senior posts in the UK.

==Wartime work in military analysis==

During the Second World War, Bronowski worked in operations research for the UK&#x27;s Ministry of Home Security, where he developed mathematical approaches to bombing strategy for RAF Bomber Command.

At the end of the war, Bronowski was part of a British team of scientists and civil engineers who visited Japan to document the effects of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for the purpose of studying the effects of the atomic bomb and its implications for future UK civil defence. Bronowski, in conjunction with Professor W. N. Thomas of Cardiff University, subsequently produced the secret &quot;Report of the British Mission to Japan: the Effects of the Atomic Bombs Dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki&quot;, which was passed to various government departments and consulted in the design of future UK public buildings. It was simultaneously published in the US.

==Postwar biological analysis==
Following his experiences of the after-effects of the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombings, he discontinued his work for British military research and turned to biology, as did his friend Leo Szilard, and many other physicists of that time, to better understand the nature of violence. Subsequently, Bronowski became Director of Research for the National Coal Board in the UK, and an associate director of the Salk Institute from 1964.

In 1950, Bronowski was given the Taung Child&#x27;s fossilised skull and asked to try, using his statistical skills, to combine a measure of the size of the skull&#x27;s teeth with their shape to discriminate them from the teeth of apes. Work on this turned his interests towards the biology of humanity&#x27;s intellectual products.

==Public science education==
In 1967 Bronowski delivered the six Silliman Memorial Lectures at Yale University and chose as his subject the role of imagination and symbolic language in the progress of scientific knowledge. Transcripts of the lectures were published posthumously in 1978 as &quot;The Origins of Knowledge and Imagination&quot; and remain in print. He first became familiar to the British public through appearances on the BBC television version of &quot;The Brains Trust&quot; in the late 1950s. 

=== &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot; (1973); BBC television documentary ===
Bronowski is best remembered for this 13-part series about the history of human life and scientific endeavour. This project was commissioned by David Attenborough, then Head of BBC2, and was intended to complement two preceding series: art historian Kenneth Clark&#x27;s &quot;personal view&quot; series &quot;Civilisation&quot; (1969), which had covered cultural history, and Alistair Cooke&#x27;s series &quot;&quot; (first broadcast in 1972).

The documentary was described as &quot;a landmark in television&quot; and &quot;lavishly produced and visually stunning, it impressed viewers with its lucidity and with the power of the presenter’s personality&quot;.

==== Auschwitz scene ====
In a personal scene filmed at Auschwitz concentration camp, where many Polish members of his family died during the Holocaust, Bronowski walks into the muddy waters where the ashes of his family were thrown, saying:
It is said that science will dehumanise people and turn them into numbers. That is false - tragically false. Look for yourself. This is the concentration camp and crematorium at Auschwitz. This is where people were turned into numbers. Into this pond were flushed the ashes of four million people. And that was not done by gas. It was done by arrogance. It was done by dogma. It was done by ignorance. When people believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality - this is how they behave. This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods.

In an interview by Michael Parkinson conducted soon after the program was broadcast, Bronowski&#x27;s recounted his visit to Auschwitz leading to Parkinson&#x27;s describing the segment as one of the most memorable parts of any interview he had done. Decades later and at the end of his career, Parkinson said: &quot;if I could save one interview from the thousands I have done, it would be the one-man show with Professor Jacob Bronowski.&quot;

==Personal life==
Bronowski married Rita Coblentz in 1941. The couple had four daughters, the eldest was the academic Lisa Jardine and another is the filmmaker Judith Bronowski.

He died in 1974 of a heart attack in East Hampton, New York, a year after &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot; was first broadcast. His ashes were buried in the western side of London&#x27;s Highgate Cemetery, near the entrance. Rita died in California in September 2010 aged 92. The ashes of Lisa Jardine, who died in 2015, were buried on 25 October 2016 next to his grave in Highgate Cemetery.

== Legacy ==
In 1970, John Cleese says &quot;I&#x27;m not Doctor bloody Bronowski!&quot; in the Monty Python sketch, &quot;Exploding Penguin on the TV Set&quot;. In 2011, on the reissue of &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot; with a foreword by Richard Dawkins, Tim Radford in &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it &quot;as compelling as ever&quot;.

In 2013, Cambridge University Press published a critique, &quot;Jacob Bronowski: a humanist intellectual for an atomic age, 1946–1956&quot;, by the science historian Ralph Desmarais, who wrote: &quot;Witnessing Hiroshima helped transform him from pure mathematician–poet to scientific administrator ... to fame on the BBC airwaves ... from literary intellectual who promoted the superior truthfulness of poetry and poets to scientific humanist insisting that science and scientists were the standard-bearers of truth&quot;, but &quot;discussing atomic energy ... Bronowski not only downplayed the bomb&#x27;s significance but was deliberately vague regarding Britain&#x27;s atomic weapon development programme.&quot;

In 2015, the British Science Association launched The Jacob Bronowski Award Lecture at the British Science Festival in September, launched in partnership with the Victoria and Albert Museum, to celebrate cutting-edge work at the interface between the arts and sciences. In 2019, Timothy Sandefur&#x27;s biography &quot;The Ascent of Jacob Bronowski: The Life and Ideas of a Popular Science Icon&quot;, he describes Bronowski as more than a polymath, and that he &quot;was involved with nearly every major intellectual undertaking of the twentieth century&quot;; that he was a &quot;serious philosopher&quot; who made &quot;probably the finest documentary film ever made&quot;. 

Sandefur&#x27;s biography was reviewed in &quot;Nature&quot; by David Edgerton, who writes of Bronowski&#x27;s BBC documentary: &quot;Lavishly produced and visually stunning, it impressed viewers with its lucidity and with the power of the presenter’s personality. Many who saw it still remember it as a landmark in television.&quot; He is critical overall of Bronowski: &quot;His analysis of the relationship between science, the military and power was persistently disingenuous.&quot;

In October 2023, an article in &quot;Varsity&quot; magazine wrote of Bronowski&#x27;s TV documentary: &quot;His passion guided his eloquence as if hoping to make the viewer just as interested as he was. Neither was his tone patronising or overly simplified.&quot;

<text>Southern Television was the ITV broadcasting licence holder for the South and South-East of England from 30 August 1958 to 31 December 1981. The company was launched as ″Southern Television Limited″ and the title &#x27;Southern Television&#x27; was consistently used on-air throughout its life. However, in 1966, during the application process for contracts running from 1968, the company renamed itself &#x27;Southern Independent Television Limited&#x27;, a title which was used until 1980 when the company reverted to its original corporate name. Southern Television ceased broadcasting on the morning of 1 January 1982 at 12:43, after a review during the 1980 franchise round gave the contract to Television South.

==Launch==
When the Independent Television Authority (ITA) advertised for applicants to run the south of England station in 1958, Southern Television beat eight other applicants for the contract. Its initial shareholders were Associated Newspapers, the Rank Organisation and the Amalgamated Press, each holding one third of the company. Associated Newspapers was allowed to remain a shareholder in Southern, only on the condition that it sold its remaining 10% stake in Associated-Rediffusion to avoid owning parts of two ITV companies; the Amalgamated Press dropped out of the consortium before the station went on air. This led to Associated Newspapers and Rank increasing their stakes to 37.5% each, and D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd taking the remaining 25%.

Southern Television was the ninth ITA franchise to launch, beginning transmissions on 30 August 1958 at 5:30 p.m. with the first playing of &quot;Southern Rhapsody&quot;, the station theme which was used to begin each day&#x27;s transmission until 31 December 1981, written by composer Richard Addinsell and performed by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, with Addinsell himself conducting. The first presenter on air was continuity announcer Meryl O&#x27;Keefe (later to become a BBC announcer); her first on-air announcement was followed by an outside broadcast link-up fronted by Julian Pettifer (later a war correspondent) and a regional news bulletin read by Martin Muncaster.

Other opening night programmes included a &quot;Filmed Playhouse&quot; drama entitled &quot;The Last Reunion&quot;, a preview programme called &quot;Coming Shortly&quot;, an episode of the American crime drama &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; and a networked opening night programme entitled &quot;Southern Rhapsody&quot;, starring Gracie Fields and the Lionel Blair Dancers, televised from the station&#x27;s studios in a converted cinema in the Northam area of Southampton and the ocean liner &quot;Caronia&quot;, which was berthed in Southampton docks.

==Programming==
Regular programmes produced by Southern Television included the regional news magazine &quot;Day by Day&quot;, presented by Cliff Michelmore, Christopher Peacock, Barry Westwood, Peter Clark, and long-serving weather forecaster Trevor Baker; &quot;Out of Town&quot;, a countryside programme introduced by Jack Hargreaves, who would later join Southern Television&#x27;s board of directors; &quot;How&quot;, a children&#x27;s science programme also featuring Hargreaves along with Fred Dinenage, Bunty James (later replaced by Marian Davies) and Jon Miller; &quot;Freewheelers&quot;, a children&#x27;s spy series; &quot;Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years&quot; and &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot;, starring Jon Pertwee as the eponymous walking scarecrow. &quot;Houseparty&quot; was a magazine show made in the style of a fly on the wall observation of participants&#x27; daily get-togethers, with regular guests including Cherry Marshall. Southern Television also produced a programme aimed at the farming community, presented by Mark Jenner, &quot;Farm Progress&quot; was broadcast at around 10:30 on Sunday mornings. A late-night epilogue was introduced by Roger Royle. Alongside &#x27;Trevor the Weather&#x27;, weather forecasts were also presented by Cyril Ockenden.

Generally, the company produced more networked children&#x27;s programmes than shows for adults, scoring a particularly strong seller internationally with an adaptation of Enid Blyton&#x27;s &quot;The Famous Five&quot;. Also worth noting was the children&#x27;s programme &quot;The Saturday Banana&quot;, hosted by Bill Oddie (then one of The Goodies) which saw the placing of a fibreglass banana outside the studios, supported by its peeled &#x27;skin&#x27;. Southern also produced the children&#x27;s game show &quot;Runaround&quot; which was hosted by Mike Reid.

The broadcaster was known for its enlightened classical music broadcasting, including studio concerts by the local Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in &quot;Music in Camera&quot;. From 1972, Southern Television broadcast up to two operas from Glyndebourne each season, some of which have since been issued on DVD.

The Southern Television archive passed to Primetime who were later acquired by Australian company Southern Star, which later sold it to Renown Pictures, which shows some of the content on its own channel Talking Pictures TV, including Southern soap opera &quot;Together&quot;; amongst other old film libraries that Renown owns, Euroarts own Southern&#x27;s music output including its Glyndebourne operas.

In its last three years on the air Southern showed many foreign-language films in its Friday &quot;Late, Late Show&quot;, including as many as eight by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and others by Werner Herzog, Andrzej Wajda, Wim Wenders, Federico Fellini and many more.

==Studios==

===Southampton===
The station&#x27;s original studios were in a converted cinema, the Plaza, in Northam, Southampton.

With the advent of colour in 1969, the company moved to purpose-built new studios next door to the existing site, built on land reclaimed from the River Itchen.

The studios at Northam were sold on to TVS in 1981, and sold again by TVS to Meridian Broadcasting in 1992. Meridian relocated to a much smaller office building in Whiteley in 2004, and the site at Northam was sold to developers. The studio complex was demolished in 2010. Blocks of flats have now been erected on the site.

===Dover===
The company also ran production offices and a studio in Dover, to serve the eastern part of its region. The studio was opened in 1961, after the ITA&#x27;s VHF Dover television transmitter went into operation the year before. The studio on Russell Street was mainly used for regional news production although some non-news programmes including the long-running rural affairs series &quot;Farm Progress&quot;, feature series and documentaries such as &quot;Elusive Butterflies&quot; and &quot;Dougalling&quot; and the nightly Epilogue (known for years as &quot;Guideline&quot;) were also produced from Dover.

During Southern&#x27;s tenure as the ITV franchise broadcaster, the company strived to produce dedicated opt outs for the east of the region – the first British television service of its kind. Southern&#x27;s South East news team in Dover produced separate bulletins for the area as an opt-out into the &quot;Day by Day&quot; programme each weeknight. A dedicated South East bulletin was also broadcast after &quot;News at Ten&quot;. More well known to South East viewers was &quot;Scene South East&quot;, a weekly magazine programme introduced on 9 October 1964 as &quot;Friday on Ten&quot; (so named due to its transmission on VHF Channel 10), and which replaced &quot;Day by Day&quot; on Friday nights. Its popularity led to the introduction of a shorter &quot;Scene Midweek&quot; programme on Wednesdays from 1977 onwards. Local commercials specific to the region were also broadcast to the Dover transmitter only, via the presentation control area at the Southampton studios.

Dover-based presenters and reporters included Mike Field, Jeff Thomas, Malcolm Mitchell, Tim Brinton, Simon Theobalds, Arnie Wilson, Jill Cochrane, Derek Williamson, Pat Sloman, David Haigh (editor of &quot;Scene South East&quot;), Donald Dougall and Mike Fuller. The Dover studio directors were David Pick and Maurice Harper. The floor manager was John Heather and the production assistant was Gillie Slaven. During the transition from Southern TV to TVS, two production secretaries were appointed, Gwenneth Hughes and Denise Hood.

After Southern lost its franchise to TVS, the studios were used to produce the successor&#x27;s regional news programmes for the South East — &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; and &quot;TVS News&quot;. Once TVS&#x27;s studios in Maidstone were opened, the Dover studios were closed in 1983 and demolished a year later. The site is now a car park.

===Other facilities===

Unique in ITV and reflecting the area&#x27;s maritime history the company converted a Second World War motor torpedo boat into a floating outside broadcasting unit named &quot;Southerner&quot;.

There were regional offices in Maidstone, Dorchester, Brighton and Reading. There were also sales offices at Stag Place, London and Oxford Street, Manchester.

==Identity==

Southern Television&#x27;s logo is sometimes said to be a compass (with the directional station name and the fact that the bottom point on the logo is longest suggesting a compass pointing south in the direction of Southern Television&#x27;s service area); however, the general consensus is that it is a star, named after the Southern Star and because Southern Television&#x27;s final transmission showed the logo zooming off into the night sky. For the purposes of this article, the logo will be referred to as a star, to reflect what it is most popularly called.

Southern Television&#x27;s first identity featured an art deco style star which zoomed into screen before the bottom point extended downwards with varying tones. This was replaced in the early 1960s with a white rotating star against a black background against a drumroll jingle. This was again altered in the mid-1960s to the familiar star shape against a black background and accompanied by a jingle featuring a cacophony of noises. This shape formed from a circle, with the diagonal lines moving out and joining the circle and the horizontal and vertical lines being drawn last, with the name added last.

This ident remained with the station until the end of its existence with some modifications; firstly the jingle was altered to nine notes on a guitar a few years later, and then the background was revealed to be blue in 1969 with the introduction of colour (blue was the background colour of the ident as used in black and white; being shot with black background and white star would have given too much contrast and overexposed the camera). This ident with blue background colour was maintained after the introduction of colour transmissions because this still provided a good contrast on black and white TV sets. This ident, occasionally supplemented by a subsequent caption stating, &#x27;The Station that serves the South&#x27;, lasted until the company ceased transmission in 1982.

In addition to these idents, a clock was used featuring a blue background and Southern legend, and for introducing links between programmes, in-vision continuity was utilised often. Continuity announcers included:
*Brian Nissen (transferred to TVS in 1982)
*Christopher Robbie (transferred to TVS in 1982)
*Keith Martin
*Gill Hewitt
*Verity Martindill

==1980 franchise round==

The 1980 Independent Television franchise round required Southern Television to re-apply to the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) to continue to broadcast to the South and South East of England from 1982. Applications from rival companies were highly competitive. On the 28th December 1980, Southern Television lost its franchise to Television South (TVS), a new consortium with fresh ideas and bold plans that were different from Southern Television&#x27;s proposals.

Southern&#x27;s response from the IBA was met with anger and disbelief by its board of directors. Although the IBA gave its standard reason for its decision that the competitor offered greater investment and a better mix of programmes, it was suggested the station&#x27;s non-local ownership may have swayed the balance against it. Further speculation may have been the company&#x27;s conservative nature and with a new decade just dawned, the south of England in time would be a radically different area. It was felt that Southern Television&#x27;s application was more of the same tried and tested formula, over time would not have reflected the possibilities for the area. Another possibility was the incumbent&#x27;s complacency: its original application was a mere 16 pages long. Tactfully the IBA invited Southern Television to re-submit, this time asking the company to go into more depth with its plans.

TVS spent months trying to persuade Southern to sell its studios until they relented. TVS was forced to use portable office buildings (popularly known as Portakabins, a brand name) in Southern&#x27;s car park as a temporary measure until its day of broadcast on 1st January 1982. Southern reluctantly agreed to lease its studios to TVS for the production of TVS programmes and sell them back to TVS outright at the end of 1981. 

The handover was tinged with acrimony on behalf of Southern&#x27;s management, which appeared to take its anger at the decision out on TVS rather than the IBA, who made the actual choice.

In Southern Television&#x27;s final productions, &quot;Day by Yesterday&quot;, &quot;And It&#x27;s Goodbye From Us&quot;, a song was featured, composed and performed by Richard Stilgoe, deriding the incoming TVS as &quot;Portakabin TV&quot; and mocking TVS for choosing Maidstone as a production base in the newly enlarged dual region—despite the fact that Southern Television itself had already purchased a site at Vinters Park in Maidstone for a planned studio complex, which it would have built had it retained its franchise. Southern Television sold the land on to TVS at a considerable profit.

==Closure of Southern Television==
Southern Television&#x27;s final programme &quot;And It&#x27;s Goodbye From Us&quot; ended at 12:43 a.m. on New Year&#x27;s Day 1982. The programme closed with a medley of songs sung by Lillian Watson and performed by the Bournemouth Sinfonietta under conductor Owain Arwel Hughes. The show&#x27;s presenter and long-serving continuity announcer Christopher Robbie, signed off from Southern Television with these words:

Afterwards, the camera panned to show many of the on-air talent and company executives standing solemnly as their names were displayed on-screen and the &quot;Southern Fantasia&quot; (composed especially for the show by Jonathan Burton, and performed earlier on in the programme) was played in the final two minutes. When the piece came to a climactic end, the lights on the set were gradually turned off, for the last time, fading to the Southern Television Colour Production slide which dissolved into the station&#x27;s logo, spinning away into an animated starry sky. 

The acoustic guitar jingle played for what would be the final time with a deep extended echo, and the screen slowly and silently faded to black, remaining that way for close to a minute. There were no closing or shut-down announcements, no suggestions for viewers to switch off their television sets, nor even the customary playing of the national anthem. 

At 12:45 a.m. the transmitters were shut down, putting a permanent end to Southern&#x27;s broadcasts after 24 years. Exactly 8 hours and 40 minutes later, Television South began broadcasting in Southern&#x27;s former region.

Southern Television&#x27;s programme archive was sold to Southern Star Group and then Renown Pictures; the names &quot;Southern Television Ltd&quot;, &quot;Southern Independent Television&quot; and &quot;Southern Television&quot;, and the star device idents used between 1958 and 1981, all transferred to &quot;Art Attack&quot; and &quot;Finger Tips&quot; producer Nic Ayling in 2004. Southern Television now trades as an independent production company.

In August 2008, ITV Meridian commemorated the 50th anniversary of Southern Television&#x27;s first transmission with special reports on &quot;Thames Valley Tonight&quot; and &quot;Meridian Tonight&quot; (South and South East editions) alongside a half-hour programme presented by Fred Dinenage.

In 2022, Renown Pictures/Talking Pictures TV put many of the programmes from their Southern TV archive onto their TPTV Encore streaming service. Programmes uploaded to TPTV Encore include &quot;Runaround&quot;, &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Rock&quot; and &quot;Tell Me Another&quot;.

<doc id="241533" wikidata="Q943972" url="?curid=241533" title="Iguvine Tablets">
<text>The Iguvine Tablets, also known as the Eugubian Tablets or Eugubine Tables, are a series of seven bronze tablets from ancient Iguvium (modern Gubbio), Italy, written in the ancient Italic language Umbrian. The earliest tablets, written in the native Umbrian alphabet, were probably produced in the 3rd century BC, and the latest, written in the Latin alphabet, from the 1st century BC. The tablets contain religious inscriptions that memorialize the acts and rites of the Atiedian Brethren, a group of 12 priests of Jupiter with important municipal functions at Iguvium. The religious structure present in the tablets resembles that of the early stage of Roman religion, reflecting the Roman archaic triad and the group of gods more strictly related to Jupiter. Discovered in a farmer&#x27;s field near Scheggia in the year 1444, they are currently housed in the Civic Museum of the Palazzo dei Consoli in Gubbio.

The tablets are the longest document of any of the Osco-Umbrian group of languages, which are closely related to Latin. The tablets shed light on the grammar of the language, and also on the religious practices of the ancient peoples of Italy, including the archaic religion of the Romans. Parts of tablets VI and VII appear to be written in an accentual metre, similar to the Saturnian metre that is encountered in the earliest Latin poetry.

The complete text, together with a translation into Latin, was published in 1849 by Aufrecht and Kirkhoff, in London in 1863 by Francis Newman, and in 1931 by Albrecht von Blumenthal. G. Devoto&#x27;s edition dates from 1948. James W. Poultney published&quot;The Bronze Tables of Iguvium&quot; in 1959 (which received the Goodwin Award in 1961), which included English translations along with notes, a glossary, etc. Although the general meaning of the tablets is clear, there are still some debated points and issues. The main difficulty in understanding the text is insufficient knowledge of Umbrian vocabulary.

These are the only documents with details of sacred rituals from the ancient religions of Europe which have survived in an almost complete state. Moreover, their content deals with the rituals (sacrifices and prayers) addressed to the highest gods of the local community and to some extent may reflect the common religious beliefs and practices of the Italic peoples.

The modern Festival of Ceri, celebrated every year in Gubbio on May 15 in honor of Bishop Ubald or Ubaldo of Gubbio (1084–1160), shares certain features with the rites described in the text and so may be a survival of that ancient pre-Christian custom. It is also celebrated in Jessup, Pennsylvania, a town with a large number of immigrants from the Gubbio area, as Saint Ubaldo Day.

== Discovery ==
There are two versions of the discovery of the tablets. The first one says that a farmer found them in a field near Scheggia in 1444. After his death, his son-in-law with his wife and his sister-in-law sold them to the city of Gubbio with a notarial deed on 25 August 1456 for two years&#x27; worth of farming rights. Since Scheggia was the site of the temple of Jupiter Apenninus, an important Umbrian sanctuary, it is conceivable that the plates were kept in the temple itself. The second version, first attested in the 17th century, states that the tablets were found in a basement of the Roman theater in Gubbio. However, given that all the actors involved in the sale of the tablets were natives of Scheggia, that the tradition of finding them in Scheggia has been attested in Scheggia itself since at least the early 1600s, and that the sources of the Gubbio find at the same time attested that the tablets were originally nine and that two of them, loaned to Venice, were never returned (which is patently false), it is likely that the latter version of the Gubbio find has a chauvinistic origin.

==Decipherment==
The content of the tablets concerns the religions and ceremonies that were celebrated at Iguvium, the town&#x27;s religious organization and its boundaries.

The first attempt at deciphering their meaning was made by Bernardino Baldi in the beginning of the 17th century, and he was followed by Adriaan van Schrieck, who believed the tablets were in the Low German language, and interpreted them accordingly. Olivieri recognized the name of Eugubium in one frequently recurring word. Louis Bourget pointed out that one of the tablets written in the Etruscan letters corresponded with two written in Roman letters. Karl Otfried Müller, in &quot;Die Etrusker&quot;, showed that in spite of the use of Etruscan letters, the language of the inscriptions was different from the Etruscan language. Lepsius added to the epigraphical criticism of the tablets, and Lassen and Grotefend made several successful attempts at interpretation. Aufrecht and Kirchhoff, working off of their predecessors and under the scientific method, created a refined interpretation.

The understanding of this text has been a key component in making progress in the decipherment of another ritual text, the Etruscan Liber Linteus.

==Epigraphic note==
The tablets are engraved on bronze. Analysis of the external appearance of the supporting material has led scholars to conclude that only tablets V, VI and VII were meant to be exposed in public. The other ones were cast as an archive document. They are inscribed in Italic alphabet derived from Etruscan (T. I to Vb 8) and in Latin alphabet (T. Vb 9 onwards, VI, VII).

==Date==
The study of the &quot;ductus&quot; (writing style), conducted by comparing the tablets with other inscriptions from the area of Central Italy, has allowed scholars to conclude that they date from no later than the end of the 3rd century for T. III and IV to the first half of the 1st century for the latest T. VI and VII.

==Content==
Tablets I to V present their topic in a concise, matter of fact manner. Tablets VI and VII repeat the same subject as Tablet I in a much more detailed and diluted way, with apparent literary and encomiastic intentions and overtones. The content of the tablets is given below, in their relative order of antiquity as established by Newman on the authority of Aufrecht and Kirchhoff, which is identical to that recently indicated by A. Maggiani.

===Tablet I===
====Side A====

Six triplet sacrifices to the Grabovian triad and the minor triad:

After observing the birds before and the behind, three oxen are sacrificed to &quot;Iove Grabovius&quot; before (without) the &quot;Trebulana Gate&quot;. Behind (within) it three sows are sacrificed to &quot;Trebus Iovio&quot;.

Before the &quot;Tesenaca Gate&quot; three oxen are sacrificed to &quot;Marte Grabovie&quot;. Behind it three pigs are sacrificed to &quot;Fisus Sancius&quot;. A libation ensues.

Before the &quot;Vehiia Gate&quot; three white fronted oxen are sacrificed to &quot;Vofione Grabovie&quot;. Behind the Gate three ewe lambs are sacrificed to &quot;Tefre Iovie&quot;. After the profanation of the lambs, the rump is offered in expiation and a libation for the &quot;tota&quot;, local community, ensues, on the two sides separately starting with the right side. After the profanation of the rumps is over the backs shall be profanated.

====Side B====

Two more triplet sacrifices to &quot;Marte Hodie&quot; and &quot;Hondos Çerfios&quot; in atonement for the citadel:

At the Jovian grove after the shearing of sheep three male calves shall be sacrificed to &quot;Marte Hodie&quot; for the Iguvine people and &quot;tota&quot;.

At the Coreties (Quiritius or Curiatius) grove three male calves shall be sacrificed to &quot;Hontos Çerfios&quot;.

Henceforth the citadel will be expiated. If any anything vicious happened in the discharge of the rite the birds shall be observed, the rite shall be reinstated once again after returning to the Trebulana Gate.

Review of the city militia and expulsion (&quot;extermination&quot;) of the traditional enemies of Iguvium (Tadinates, Etruscans, Nahartes, Iapuzcoi) by the &quot;arfertur&quot; and the two &quot;prinovatus&quot; (&quot;augures&quot; or their attendants):

* Tadinates (&quot;tařinate(m)&quot;), refers to the Umbrians from Gualdo Tadino;
* Tusci (&quot;tursku(m)&quot;) refers to the Etruscans, with the possible meaning in Umbrian of boundary;
* Nahartes (&quot;Naharku(m)&quot;), refers to the Umbrians from around the Nera valley in southeastern Umbria, from Nahar the ancient name of the river Nera. According to another interpretation, it refers to the Sabines east of Nahar/Nera river.
* Iapuzcoi (&quot;Iapuzku(m)&quot;, a tribe of unclear origin, on which there are various hypotheses: a people of the Adriatic side near Piceni at the borders with the Umbrians, Iapygians of southeastern Italy, or the Iapydes of Illyria. The first hypothesis is the most plausible.

Four more triplet sacrifices:

Near the small fontains three red boars shall be sacrificed to Çerfos Martios.

On the Rubinian &quot;ager&quot; three she boars shall be sacrificed to Prestata Çerfia of Çerfos Martios. The sacred jugs, black and white, shall there be ordered and turned.

Beyond the &quot;Sahata&quot; (&quot;Sahata&quot; is probably the area considered within the pomerium, possibly marked by a stream) three she calves shall be sacrificed to Tursa Çerfia of Çerfios Martios.

The assignation of the place where to carry out the slaughter of the boars shall be decided according to the site upon which the officiant is watching, whether either behind on the &quot;Rubina&quot; or beyond on the &quot;Sahata&quot;.

Three days later the people shall be assembled and three heifers sacrificed below the Forum of &quot;Sehemania&quot; (&quot;Semonia&quot;) to &quot;Tursa Iovia&quot; at &quot;Acedonia&quot;. One of the heifers shall be consecrated by the &quot;arfertur&quot; and two by the &quot;prinovatus&quot;.

===Tablet II===
====Side A (B of Lepsius)====

(Lacuna at the beginning of the text).

Sacrifice of an ox to &quot;Iove Patre&quot;, of a ram to &quot;Iovio&quot;? (&quot;Iuno&quot; according to Newman), of a lamb to &quot;Iovio&quot; (&quot;Iuno&quot;) and of a boar to &quot;Marte&quot;.

The Hondia (elements that pertain to ritual sacrifice to Hondus, an earth deity)
Preparations made by the &quot;arfertur&quot;: readying of the victim(s), grains, &quot;strues&quot;, &quot;fertum&quot;; incense or meal, wine; salt, &quot;mola&quot;; &quot;mandraculum&quot; (white linen used to wrap the officiant&#x27;s hand), vases; pure water; ignition of the fire at the &quot;ara&quot;. Petronian Feast to &quot;Hontos Iovios&quot;: sacrifice to &quot;Hontos Iovios&quot; of puppies, offers of wine, libation, partition of the meats and their exposition on a board. Holding and turning of the &quot;ara&quot; with the hands and offer of wine. Division of the wine, the strues and ferctum, the meats among the participants. Burning (or inhumation) of the puppies at the &quot;ara&quot;.

====Side B (A of Lepsius)====

Sacrifice and feast of the Attidian Brotherhood:

Sacrifice of a pig and a ram to &quot;Iove&quot; at the time of the &quot;decuriae&quot; of month &quot;Semonius&quot; by the ten sets of families of each of the 12 regions. Sacred &quot;Epulum&quot; (feast) in honour of &quot;Iove Patre&quot;, started in town and profanated at the various &quot;fana&quot; with libations using the &quot;mandraculum&quot;.

Vocian (Buck: Lucian) Feast to &quot;Iupater&quot;:

Sacrifice of a calf to &quot;Iove Patre&quot; for the Vocian (Lucian?) &quot;gens&quot; of the Attidians. The sacrifice is conducted with the &quot;urfeta&quot; in one hand at the offering and the &quot;crencatro&quot; (augural implement comparable to the &quot;lituum&quot; but crossed (Newman), or toga wore slanted across the right shoulder (Buck)) in the right hand at the time of the slaughtering.

===Tablets III and IV===
Sacrifice to Puemonos Popricos and Vesuna.

General prescriptions concerning the holding of the sacrifice, sacrifice of the &quot;ovis&quot; (lamb) to &quot;Puemonos&quot; and &quot;Vesuna&quot; near a sacred grove. Containing details on the choice of the &quot;ohtur&quot; (&quot;auctor&quot;, head, perhaps &quot;augur&quot;) of the ceremony, the dispositions of the ritual instruments, the ritual invocations for the safety of the city to &quot;Iove Patre&quot; and &quot;Puemonos&quot;, the distribution of the sacrificial meat and the libations.

===Tablet V===
====Side A====

Duties of the &quot;arsfertur&quot;:

The &quot;arsfertur &quot;must provide whatever is essential for the ceremony and select the victims.

Fees to be levied for the performance of the rites.

Whenever the banquet of the brotherhood takes place, the &quot;fratreks&quot; or the &quot;cvestor&quot; must put to votes whether the banquet was properly arranged. If the majority of those present think it was not, a further vote must be taken to fix the penalty for the &quot;arsfertur&quot;.

====Side B====

Contributions to be made by two &quot;gentes&quot; to the brethren, and portions of flesh to be awarded them by the brethren on the decurial festival.

===Tablet VI and VII===

These two tablets repeat the content of tablet I while expanding it to include and expound the minutest details of the rituals. See below for a sample text and translation of part of tablet six.

====VI Side A====

Lustration of the &quot;arx&quot;

Introductory auspices: as in I the sacrifice is to be preceded by the taking of the auspices. Formulae passed between the augur and the arfertur (legum dictio); warning against noises, interruptions, meddling; boundaries of the augural templum; formulae of announcement of the auspices (conspectio, nuntiatio); prescriptions applying to the ensuing sacrifice concerning the military rod (&quot;pirsca arsmatia&quot;), the disposition of the pots and the fire.

#Sacrifice of three oxen to Iove Grabovios before the Trebulan gate. An opening prayer is followed by three long prayers in identical words for each of the three offerings to the three Grabovian gods and these by a general prayer in conclusion. Then follow prayers especially devoted to the rites connected with the sacrifice.
#Sacrifice of three pregnant sows to Trebos Iovios behind the Trebulan gate: the prayers used in the first sacrifice are to be repeated.

====Side B====

#Sacrifice of three oxen to Marte Grabovios before the Tesenaca gate. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated.
#Sacrifice of three suckling pigs to Fisus Sancius behind the Tesenaca gate. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated. Then an offering of cakes accompanied by specific prayers and ceremonies ensues (involving the use of the &quot;mandraculum&quot;, white linen cloth wrapping the right hand of the officiant): special attention is given to Fisus Sancius, patron of the citadel (&quot;ocre Fisia&quot;).
#Sacrifice of three oxen with a white forehead (&quot;calersuf&quot;) to Vofionos Grabovios before the Vehia gate. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated.
#Sacrifice of three she lambs to Tefer Iovios behind the Vehia gate. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated. Then supplementary offerings follow, thereafter prayers and accompanying rites with vases on both sides of a trench.
#Sacrifice of three bull calves to Marte Horse at the Iovian grove. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated.
#Sacrifice of other three bull calves to Hondos Çerfios at the Coredian grove. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated.

Rites for the lustration of the &quot;poplo&quot; (people, i. e. city militia) and execration of the enemies:

The auspices are to be taken in the same way as for the lustration of the &quot;arx&quot;. Holding the &quot;perca arsmatia&quot; (ritual staff) and the &quot;cringatro&quot; the &quot;arsfertur&quot; lights the fire then with the two assistants (&quot;prinovatus&quot;), who hold rods of pomegranate wood, marches with the victims along the Augural Way to the district of &quot;Acedonia&quot;. Proclamation is made expelling the alien enemies. The Iguvines are ordered to form in companies. The &quot;arsfertur&quot; and the assistants march about them thrice with the victims and the fire. At the end a prayer is made invoking misfortune upon the aliens and blessings upon the Iguvinians.

====VII Side a====

Sacrifice of three boars to&quot; Çerfios Martios&quot; at the &quot;Fontuli&quot;, accompanied by the prayers used at the Trebulan gate.

Sacrifice of three sows to &quot;Praestita Çerfia&quot; at &quot;Rubinia&quot;, with the prayers used at the Trebulan gate. Ceremonies with the black vessels and the white vessels, the former meant to bring misfortune to the aliens, the latter to avert it from the Iguvinians. Offering to Fisovius Sancius with the prayersw used behind the Tesenaca gate.

Sacrifice of three female calves beyond the &quot;Sahata&quot; to &quot;Tursa Çerfia&quot; of the Çerfios of Marte. The prayers used at the Trebulan gate are to be repeated. The profanation of the offerings must take place where the &quot;nuntiatio&quot; happened: either in Rubinia or beyond the Sahata.

After three days the holder of the &quot;perca arsmatia&quot; and the two assistants pray silently for the execration of the enemies and the safety of Iguvium from the shrine of Tursa. Then heifers are set free below the Forum of &quot;Sehemenia&quot;: the first person who has caught any of the first three shall sacrifice them to &quot;Tursa Iovia&quot; at &quot;Aceronia&quot; for Iguvium. The prayers and rituals (offer of cereals, strues, fertum, &quot;persea&quot;) used at the Trebulan gate are to be repeated.

====Side b====

Obligations of the &quot;fratrexs&quot; and entity of the fine he must pay in case of omissions (300 asses).

==The religion of the Umbrians as reflected in the Iguvine Tablets==
===The triad of the Grabovii===
The triad of the &quot;Grabovii&quot; is the highest group of deities of the Iguvian pantheon and looks to be strictly aligned with the archaic triad of Roman religion. The epithet Grabovius seems to be related to Etruscan &quot;crapis&quot;, ceremonial litter, which might derive from a word meaning oakwood.

The triad is composed by &quot;Iove&quot; or &quot;Iove Patre&quot;, &quot;Marte&quot; and &quot;Vofionos&quot;. The identity of the last has been understood as corresponding to Roman gods &quot;Quirinus&quot; or &quot;Liber&quot;, the latter from an IE root *h1leudh- meaning people, either directly from the Italic theonym &quot;Loifer&quot; or through the intermediary of the Italic or Etruscan interpretation of Greek god &quot;(Dionysos) Eleutheros&quot;, recorded also in the Etruscan theonym &quot;Tin Luth&quot; (=Iuppiter Liber) of the Piacenza Liver.

The gods of the triad of the Grabovii receive in sacrifice three oxen (&quot;buf&quot;) outside the three town gates (&quot;Preveres Treblanes, Tesenaces, Vehiies&quot; before the Trebulan, Tesenacan, Vehiian Gate). Those to be offered to Vofionos are qualified as &quot;calersu&quot;, probably correspondent in meaning to Latin &quot;callidus&quot;, with a white forehead.

===The minor triad===
The gods of this triad receive sacrifices in correspondence with those of the major one but these gods are honoured within the town gates. &quot;Trebos Iovios&quot; corresponds to &quot;Iove Grabovios&quot;, &quot;Fisus Sancius&quot; to &quot;Marte Grabovios&quot; and &quot;Tefer Iovios&quot; to &quot;Vofionos Grabovios&quot;. They received sacrifices of three pregnant sows, three suckling pigs and three ewe lambs respectively. Only the identity of the second one is known with any degree of certainty from attestations of his existence in Rome and elsewhere in Italy. In Rome he is known as Semo Sancus Dius Fidius. It is odd that he is here associated with Mars while his association with Jupiter would seem more well grounded theologically. The topic has been the object of a study by Dominique Briquel: he opines the reason should lie in the repressive and henceforth military connotation of the notion of divine sanction of the law. This aspect is particularly relevant as to the divine sanction of the town wall, a fact which is of primary concern in the content of the Tablets.

&quot;Trebos&quot; in &quot;Trebos Iovios&quot; is usually understood as corresponding in meaning to Latin &quot;trabs&quot;, ridge of the roof. &quot;Tefer&quot; of &quot;Tefer Iovios&quot; is often explained as burner, from the IE root *&quot;tep&quot; heat. This interpretation though is very debated.

Both Benveniste and Dumézil have argued that the Iguvine triads are just another testimony of their three functional hypothesis of IE religion. In particular the sacrificial offerings roughly correspond to those of Rome in their three functional significance and the sixfold invocations of VIa 30 and 39, VIb 13 and 32 (&quot;nerf, arsmo; veiro, peiquo; castruo, fri&quot;: princes, priests; men, cattle; fields, land produce) show a direct connection to the sovereign, military and productive activities.

===Other deities===

====Hondos Iovios====

Many scholars, from Bücheler to Prosdocimi, opine this deity is an underworld god of agricultural fertility and plenty on the grounds of the sacrifice of puppies he receives at his festival. Prosdocimi calls it the &quot;intermestruae cereales&quot;: the declaration of the dog is set at the climax of the &quot;feriae&quot;. Jörg Rüpke remarks the association of Hondos with Jupiter is one among the numerous in the tablets, in which a complex multilevel and hierarchic structure of relationship among theonyms is envisaged. This phenomenon would put the god into a sort of host–guest relationship with the one given in the attributive. In the case of Hondos this feature is apparent also in the fact that his cults at the Hondia festival take place in the Jovian Grove but those at the lustration of the citadel (when the god bears the epithet of Çerfios) in the Coredian Grove.

It has been suggested that the theonym &quot;Hunte Çefi&quot; (&quot;Honde Serfi&quot;), referring to a chthonic god, derives from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*ǵʰōm-to&quot; &#x27;earth&#x27;, a stem attested in several branches.

====Çerfos Martios, Praesta(o)ta Çerfia, Tursa Çerfia, Tursa Iovia====

These deities are invoked and receive sacrifices aimed at obtaining their favour for the protection of the &quot;arx&quot; itself, of the community and of the fields in connexion to the lustration rites of the Iguvian citadel at different locations of augural relevance.

The rites concerning the &quot;Praestota&quot; and the two &quot;Tursae&quot; involve a complex of libations aimed at obtaining a twofold action: the safety for the Iguvine community and the offsetting and expulsion of its traditional enemies.

The debated points are few as far as the &quot;Praestota&quot; and &quot;Tursa&quot; are concerned. The two theonyms correspond to the Latin &quot;Iuppiter Praestes&quot;, &quot;Iuppiter Praestitus&quot;, &quot;Iuppiter Praestabilis&quot; and the &quot;Lares Praestites&quot;. &quot;Tursa&quot; corresponds to god &quot;Terminus&quot;, being the deity that represents the boundaries of the city at different locations of augural relevance: these are without and within the city for &quot;Tursa Çerfia&quot; and &quot;Tursa Iovia&quot; respectively (TI I b; VII a). Such a meaning is connected to the Umbrian word for border, &quot;tuder&quot;: &quot;Tursa&quot; is written &quot;Tuda&quot; in the Etruscan tablets, the intervocalic &quot;d&quot; being pronounced as a weak &quot;rs&quot; (i.e.: ḍ). Dumézil on the other hand, on the grounds of the function of &quot;Tursa&quot;, a deity whose action is to scare, inspire terror into the enemies, opines the theonym derives from a verbal root equivalent to Latin &quot;terreo&quot;, I scare (interpreting accordingly &quot;tursitu, tremitu&quot; in VIb 60).

There is no agreement among scholars on the meaning of the epithet &quot;Çerfios&quot; and as to whether this is also a theonym, i. e. &quot;Çerfos Martios&quot; is a god different from Mars or not. An inscription from Corfinium reads: &quot;Çerfom sacaracicer Semunes sua[d&quot;, &quot;priest of the Çerfi and the Semones&quot;, placing side by side the two categories of entities, the &quot;çerfi&quot; and the &quot;semunes&quot;. &quot;Çerfos&quot; is most times associated to IE root *ker(s) and Latin theonyms &quot;Ceres&quot; and &quot;Cerus&quot;. This view though might create interpretative problems concerning the theology of Mars and of the two deities who in Rome are associated with the sphere of law and defence, i. e. gods Jupiter and Semo Sancus Dius Fidius. Georg Wissowa and Dumézil both underline that the derivation from root *ker(s) is not certain: Umbrian group -&quot;rf&quot; could have a different origin than -&quot;rs&quot;.

====Marte Hodie; Hondos Çerfios====

Marte and Hondos appear also under these epithets. Here too the only certain indication is from Roman &quot;Heres&quot; (or &quot;Here&quot;) &quot;Martea&quot;, connected with &quot;heres&quot;, he who inherits and also &quot;dominus&quot;, the position of master of the house. Some scholars though connect the epithet to Latin adjective &quot;fodius&quot;, he who destroys. The two gods both receive sacrifices of male calves in the rites for the lustration of the citadel at the Iovian and Coredian groves respectively; theirs are the last in the series of sacrifices after the two triads and before the execration of the enemies.

God Hondos receives the epithet &quot;Iovios&quot; in II and that of &quot;Çerfios&quot; in VI. This fact raises the question of whether these epithets were used alternatively in connexion with local or temporal constraints. Another similar instance is that of &quot;Tursa Çerfia&quot; and &quot;Tursa Iovia&quot;, who are found without and within the &quot;pomerium&quot; respectively.

====Puemonos Pupricos and Vesuna of Puemonos Pupricos====

This divine couple appears only in tablets III and IV, the most ancient ones. Puemonos&#x27;s name seems to be related with Roman goddess Pomona; moreover both the name itself and the epithet &quot;Popricos&quot; (&quot;Publicus&quot;) hint towards a universal fertility god, similar to Latin god Liber. Vesuna is also found on a coin from Marsian territory.

===General remarks on Iguvinian theonyms===

O. de Cazanove observes Iguvinian theonyms appear to be compound formations of two, three and four terms: they may consist of a substantive plus an epithet (e. g. Hondos Iovios, Tursa Iovia, Puemonos Podpricos), of a substantive plus a possessive phrase plus epithet (e. g. Vesuna of Puemonos Podpricos) and of a substantive plus epithet plus possessive phrase plus epithet (e. g. Prestota Çerfia of Çerfios Martios, Tursa Çerfia of Çerfios Martios). In his view this situation is comparable to that of Rome where are recorded purely functional deities in the pontifical books. These divinities were invoked in the prayers according to the Roman rite as mentioned by Gellius: &quot;Lua Saturni, Salacia Neptuni, Hora Quirini, Virites Quirini, Maia Vulcani, Heries Iunonis, Moles Martis, Nerio Martis&quot;&quot;. These entities would be a concrete representation of the powers of their respective god.

At Iguvium though the situation looks more complex and less fixed as Tursa and Hondos are alternatively Çerfian and Martian and Çerfian and Iovian respectively.

====Other theonyms====

Some other deities are known just because they are mentioned occasionally in specifying the limits of augural observation (included those of the town). These theonyms are for the most part known in Roman religion. They are Tursa and (possibly) Hulos in IV 17 and 19 respectively, Vestisios (Libasius) apparently god of libations (possibly related to Latin Vesta ), Hoios (cf. Latin Holus, Helus, Roman grove of Helernus in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot; II 67-68) god of vegetation and Padella (cf. Roman goddess Patella), goddess of opening sheaves in VIa 14. Possibly adjective &quot;deueia&quot; of &quot;Asa Deueia&quot; (VIa 9, 10) implies a cult of the sky under the name &quot;Dius&quot;, &quot;Dia&quot;, similar to that of Dea Dia outside Rome (Ancellotti &amp; Cerri).

===Priesthoods===
The Attidian brethren had an &quot;arsfertur&quot; (literally the Umbrian equivalent of Latin &quot;adfertor&quot;, i. e. &quot;he who carries something to somewhere&quot;, clearly referring to a role in the ceremonies, holder of the &quot;pirca arsmatia&quot;, ceremonial rod). Other mentioned offices include the &quot;fratrecs&quot; interpreted as &quot;curator arcae&quot;, the &quot;cvestor&quot; and the &quot;prinovatus&quot;, probably agrimensors, attendants of the person who takes the auspices. An &quot;ohtor&quot; (&quot;auctor&quot;) is mentioned in T. III and IV: the term denotes the person responsible for the ceremony.

===Rites===

The tablets record different sets of rites held on different festive occasions: the main and recorded in greatest detail one is the annual lustration of the citadel (&quot;ocre&quot;, Latin &quot;arx&quot;) of Iguvium (Tablets I, VI and VII). This rite includes sacrifices to the &quot;Grabovian&quot; (major) triad and the minor one near the gates of the town, sacrifices to &quot;Marte Hodie&quot; and &quot;Hondos Çerfios&quot; at the two sacred groves of &quot;Iove&quot; and &quot;Coredios&quot; (interpreted as &quot;Quiritius&quot; or &quot;Curiatius&quot;) respectively, the lustral review of the people of Iguvium in arms, i. e. the city militia, the execration and ritual expulsion (&quot;exterminatio&quot;) of the traditional enemies of Iguvium and final sacrifices to &quot;Çerfios Marti(os)&quot;, the &quot;Praestita Çerfia&quot; and the two &quot;Tursae&quot;, &quot;Çerfia and Iovia&quot;, at various locations without and within the pomerium. Tablets VI and VII relate the ritual actions such as circumambulations, libations, kneelings and dance in minute detail recording all the prayers and the other augural formulae. The older tablet I gives a more concise record.

The ritual triple (three time) circumambulation with fire and the victims about the city militia looks parallel to the Roman ritual performed by king Tullius as described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus.

The most complex ceremonies are those concerning Tefer Iovios and Fisus Sancius. A summary is appended below.

Tefer Iovios (VIb 22-42):

:Sacrifice of the ewe lambs with the usual prayers used for each god of the two triads.

:(23) Offering of the &quot;persondro sorsom&quot; (suine) at the right foot of the gate with accompanying libation.
:(24) Offering of the libations.
:(25-36) Prayer to Tefer Iovios with &quot;tripodium&quot;.

:(37) Offering of the &quot;persondro staflare&quot; (bovine or ovine) at the left foot of the gate.
:Prayer repeated.

:(38) Assigning of the &quot;prosecta&quot; (cuts of sacrificial meat).
:Assigning of the libation accompanying the &quot;persondro sorsale &quot; at the right foot where the &quot;sorso&quot; was offered to the god (profanated).
:Assigning of the libation accompanying the &quot;persondro staflare &quot; at the left foot as above.

:Burning or inhumation of the &quot;persondro sorsale&quot;.
:Burning or inhumation of the &quot;persondro staflare&quot;.

:(40) Throwing away over the head the vessels used for the &quot;persondro&quot; during the prayer on the incense (or cereal meal).

Fisus Sancius (here appealed to also as &quot;Fisovius&quot; = &quot;Fiducius&quot;) (VIb 3-18):

:Sacrifice of three suckling piglets with the usual prayers, consecration with incense (or meal) and grains as at the Trebulan gate.
:Wearing of the &quot;mandraculum&quot; (white cloth) around the right hand by the officiant.
:Adding of the &quot;ficla&quot; and &quot;strucla&quot; to the &quot;prosecta&quot;.
:Placing of the &quot;sopo&quot; (offa) at the back.

:(5) The officiant while kneeling offers the libation, the &quot;mefa&quot; and the &quot;spefa&quot; spilling them from the vessels.
:(6) Prayers for the &quot;arx&quot; and the community.
:(16) During the prayers libation and &quot;tripodium&quot;.
:Offering of the libation.
:Distribution of the &quot;prosecta&quot; and of the libation while kneeling.

:(17) Crushing and spilling over the fire of the &quot;mefa&quot;, libation, &quot;sopa&quot; (possibly lower entrails).
:Milling while sitting, prayer over the milled incense or meal.

:(18) The two profane and the two sacred jugs are disposed in rows.

The opening lines (1-14) of Tablet II records various sacrifices to &quot;Iove&quot;, &quot;Iovio&quot; (or &quot;Iovia&quot;? Newman: &quot;Iuno&quot;) and &quot;Marte&quot; to be held in atonement of possible unknown ritual faults:
the &quot;Hondia&quot; festivals on which occasion dogs were offered in sacrifice to &quot;Hondos Iovios&quot;—apparently &quot;Earthly Zeus&quot; or &quot;CHTHONIC Zeus&quot;; the feast to &quot;Hondos Iovios&quot; held by the &quot;gens Petronia&quot; (these last two festivals might in fact be one); the sacrifice and feast of the &quot;sodalitas&quot; of the &quot;Fratres Atiedii&quot; on which rams and pigs were sacrificed to &quot;Iove&quot; by the ten sets of families of the twelfth &quot;pomperias&quot;, districts of Iguvium; finally the sacrifice of a calf at the feast of &quot;Iove Patre&quot; held by the gens &quot;Vocia&quot; (&quot;Lucia&quot;). The tablet might be fragmentary, i. e. record only the final part of a ritual at its beginning.

Here is the summary of the ceremonies at the festival of Hondos with dog sacrifice (IIa 15-44) (oddly, in the following translation, katlu is translated both &quot;kid&quot; and &quot;dog&quot;):

:(15) the sum of money for the kid(s) is to be raised among the dining tables at the published price
:the arfertur makes preparations after observing the birds
:(18) the kid(s), grains, &quot;strues&quot;, &quot;fertum&quot;; incense, wine, salt, &quot;mola&quot;; &quot;mandraculum&quot;, vases (consecrated and not or wet and dry), water (or ointment) are to be prepared

(the rite, proper, seems to begin here:)
:(19)--the fire is lit on the &quot;ara&quot; (probably &quot;altar&quot;)
:the &quot;puni&quot; (incense) is consecrated

:(20) offering of the kid(s) to Hondos Iovios, declaration of its purity, for the gens Patrona among the Atiedian Brotherhood
:(22) the &quot;sopa&quot;s (underparts?) of the kid are taken and the &quot;prosiciae&quot; (cutlets) divided upon the breadcrusts
:(23) empty baskets are placed behind and the cereals before at the foot (of the &quot;ara&quot;)
:offering of the incense

::libation and &quot;tripodium&quot;

::(25) &quot;tripodium&quot; near the vessels of wine chanting in turn nine times: &quot;I honour Thee with incense and wine.&quot;
:(26) bringing of the crusts with the entrails
::(27) libation
:two cuts of the kid(s) are divided into three pieces or three times

::addition of &quot;strues&quot; and &quot;fertum&quot;
:(29) offering of the dog
:prayer over the [dog&#x27;s] foot and over the uncut flesh
::addition [of &quot;strues&quot; and &quot;fertum&quot;] to the flesh cuts

:offering of the kid(s); prayer in front of it
:prayer on the flesh, both uncut and roasted

:offering of the &quot;suppa&quot; on the plates
:prayer on the dedicatory jugs

::(31) libation, &quot;tripodium&quot;, moving and placing down of the offerings

:&quot;suppa&quot;s are placed behind, the flesh is taken by hand
:(33) the incense is placed in two jars on the bracket
:breadcrusts, fried placentas, pots both containing water (ointment) and empty are brought over
::(34) libation to Hondos Iovios from the jugs for the gens Petronia of the Attidian Brethren
:beyond the bracket, prayer on the pure breadcrusts
:same prayer on the placentae, the pure jugs filled with water and the empty ones on the bracket

::(37) libation and &quot;tripodium&quot;

:the bracket is moved aside; prayer on the pure water (ointment)
:(38) hands are washed from the &quot;ara&quot; (or the &quot;ara&quot; is turned in the hands)
:(39) back to the ara, near it silent prayer on the pure wine
:(40) bringing and distribution of whatever the participants wish: wine, incense
:(41) grinding of the &quot;strues&quot;, &quot;fertum&quot;; spilling of the incense or meal on the jar
:(42) prayer on the whole and the ground grains

:the rite is proclaimed over

:(43) the kid(s) is burnt near the &quot;ara&quot;.

Sacrifices of dogs were not common among ancient Italic people. Instances in Rome include the Lupercalia and a parallel may be found in the &quot;Augurium Canarium&quot; and the Robigalia, both held in late Spring for the propitiation of a good harvest and for the preservation of the grains from mildew respectively. According to the explanation given in Ovid by the &quot;flamen Quirinalis&quot; the dog was sacrificed because at the time in which the grains in the ears are in danger from the heat and draught, the sun enters the constellation of the Dog: this explanation is erroneous. Another ritual aimed at protecting corn in danger from fires concerned foxes which were set afire in the Circus Maximus on the last day of the &quot;Cerialia&quot; (&quot;Cerealia&quot;). Finally dogs were crucified on the Capitol at the beginning of August, time of the &quot;canicula&quot; to avert the rabies contagion or lessen their barking which disturbed sick people.

The hymn has a fairly clear structure, with the central offering of the dog sacrifice and following prayer enveloped in sequence by offerings of &quot;strues&quot; and &quot;fertum&quot;, followed by two parallel offerings and prayers, and more distantly preceded and followed by two &quot;tripodia&quot;. Activities both before and after the formal period of the rite are specified. Prayers and libations are repetitively offered throughout, while consecrating and offering (presumably this involves lighting) of the incense is prominent near the beginning and ritual washing toward the end of the ceremony.

Tablet III and IV record in minute detail the rituals of the festival of Puemonos Popricos and Vesuna at a sacred grove outside the town. Recently Michael Weiss has advanced the view that this was a new year ritual on the grounds of comparative material.

===Treatment of the offerings===

Latin sources concerning the cooking of the &quot;viscera&quot; underline the difference between the Etruscan and Roman customs distinguishing the &quot;exta aulicocta&quot; boiled in the &quot;olla extaris&quot; before the offering to the god, from the Tuscan &quot;exta&quot; roasted &quot;in veru&quot; and partly eaten during the sacrificial rite. At Iguvium the description of some sacrificial rites documents both the use of spits for the viscera and the presence of &quot;prosiciae&quot; displayed on the table of the offerings beside the fire and perhaps consecrated and burnt to the gods.

==Augury==
Augural practices are presented in the tablets, most notably in the last two ones. They include the &quot;praeire verba&quot;, i.e. the uttering of the words to be repeated by the &quot;arfertur&quot;, the &quot;legum dictio&quot;, the rules for the taking of the auspices such as silence (&quot;silentium&quot;) and the avoidance of other incidents, the definition of the boundaries of the augural &quot;templum&quot;, the &quot;nuntiatio&quot;, announcement of the appearance of the expected signs from birds, the circumambulation of the army with fire.

Tablet VIa begins with an augural song. Here below is the text (VIa 1-5) with Poultney&#x27;s translation of the passage:

Rules for the observation of bird signs are given in VIa 15-18: below a certain boundary line (&quot;hondra esto tudero&quot; VIa 15) defined previously, the augur must see and hear the verse of a &quot;parfa&quot; (&quot;parrha&quot;) and a crow; above that line (&quot;supu&quot;) he must see and hear a woodpecker &quot;peiqu&quot; and a magpie &quot;peica&quot;.

===Augural terminology===

&quot;Aveis asseriates&quot; Ia 1; &quot;aves asseriates&quot; VIa 1: &quot;avibus observatis&quot;, &quot;having observed the birds.&quot;

&quot;persnaies&quot;, &quot;pusnaies&quot; Ia 1: &quot;antici, postici&quot;, &quot;(in the part) before and behind.

&quot;dersua&quot; VIa 1: &quot;dextera&quot;, &quot;right hand, prosperous.&quot; The right hand was apparently seen as auspicious in Umbria as in Greece. Newman (Appendix II) cites the position of the augur in the inauguration of Numa, in which he faced east while Numa faced south. Right and left have both an auspicious and inauspicious meaning in Latin. One problem with this enticing analysis is that there is a distinct and separate word that means &#x27;right (hand)&#x27; in Umbrian: destre/&quot;testre&quot; which is in the expected phonological form for a cognate of Latin &quot;dexter/dextra&quot;. Poultney suggests a possible relationship of Umbrian &quot;dersua&quot; to Latin &quot;dorsum&quot; &#x27;back&#x27; since when &quot;oriented&quot; toward the rising sun, the west is to ones back.

&quot;merstu&quot; VIa 1: &quot;iustissimus&quot;, &quot;rightest, most correct, propitious,&quot; superlative of &quot;mersos&quot;. Adjective &quot;mersos&quot;, from &quot;meḍos&quot; (literally &quot;medius&quot;), means &quot;iustus&quot; (cf. Oscan &quot;meddix&quot;: supreme magistrate, &quot;iudex&quot;). Both words in Latin and Osco-Umbrian have a broader meaning than just, lawful: they may mean augurally correct, favourable, in agreement with the divine forces. But here again, the Umbrian word that fits this analysis: &quot;mers&quot; &quot;law, right, custom&quot; which is likely from the PIE root *med- as in Greek medomai &quot;to think on&quot;. Also, Umbrian formed superlatives with -emo-/-temo-, not with -sto. The context seems to call for a direction that contrasts with &quot;destrua&quot; above. As Poultney points out, the most probable source here is PIE *merk- &quot;spark&quot; with cognates in Germanic meaning &#x27;morning&#x27; (including that word itself). The semantic shift for words for &quot;morning/sunrise&quot; to words for &quot;east&quot; is, of course, ubiquitous.

&quot;anglaf&quot; VIa 1: &quot;oscines&quot;, &quot;giving signs through their voice.&quot; &lt; &quot;*an-kla:-&quot;, compare Latin &quot;cla-mo&quot; &quot;I cry (out)&quot;, &quot;cla-rus&quot; &quot;famous&quot;

&quot;stiplo&quot;, &quot;anstiplatu&quot; VIa 2, 3: &quot;stipulare&quot;, &quot;leges dicere&quot;, &quot;stipulate.&quot;

&quot;mersta auei, mersta angla, esona&quot; VIa 3: &quot;most propitious birds (auspices), most propitious singing, divine [signs]&quot; or more likely &quot;birds in the east, messengers in the east, divine [signs]&quot; The last of these may refer to lightning, according to Poultney.

&quot;stahmei stahmeitei&quot; VIa 5: &quot;statio statuta&quot;, &quot;templum designatum&quot;, &quot;augural templum,&quot; the designated space of augural observation.

&quot;neip mugatu&quot; VIa 6: &quot;ne mugito, muttito&quot;, &quot;that nobody shall make utterances, murmur.&quot; Silence is essential in augural practises,

&quot;nep arsir andersistu&quot; VIa 6: &quot;ne divis intersistito&quot;, &quot;that nobody shall come in between, barge in,&quot; between the divine (signs) and the augur.

&quot;disleralinsust&quot; VIa 7: &quot;alteravit&quot; (&quot;eṛali, erali&quot;=&quot;alter&quot;) &quot;render irritual, impair the auspice&quot;; 
&quot;attero&quot; VII a 11, 27: &quot;bad, unlucky.&quot;

&quot;verfale&quot; VIa 8: &quot;formula&quot; of the templum. According to a new etymology, de Vaan connects this noun to Latin cognate &quot;urbs&quot;, both having the meaning of defined space for augural observation, from a PIE root &quot;*u(o)rb(h)&quot; plus /d(h)-h(2) enclosure, enclosed area.

&quot;stahmito&quot; VIa 8: &quot;statutum&quot;, &quot;designated, established.&quot;

&quot;tuderato&quot; VIa 8: &quot;finitum&quot;, &quot;defined, provided with boundaries.&quot; From noun &quot;tuder&quot; boundary, Etruscan &quot;tular&quot;.

&quot;vapersus auiehcleir&quot; VIa 9: &quot;lapididibus auguralibus&quot; (ablative), &quot;(near) by the augural stones, rocks.&quot; Note the change from &quot;*l-&quot; to &quot;v-&quot; in Umbrian, also seen in Umbrian &quot;vuco&quot; versus Latin &quot;locus&quot;

&quot;tuder&quot; VIa 9: &quot;boundary, limit.&quot;

&quot;anclar&quot; VIa 16: &quot;oscines&quot; &quot;songbirds, messengers&quot;, literally &quot;those who call out&quot; &lt; *&quot;an-kla:-&quot; compare Latin &quot;clamo&quot; &quot;I cry (out)&quot;

&quot;combifiatu&quot; VIa 17: &quot;conspectum capito&quot;, &quot;nuntiato&quot;, &quot;(the augur) shall announce the appearance of the auspices.&quot; Literally &quot;confidato&quot; &quot;confide&quot;.

&quot;popler anferener&quot; VIa 19: &quot;populi recensendi, lustrandi&quot;, &quot;review of the levied army.&quot; Buck cites the parallel instance of the ritual circumambulation holding a lit torch performed by king Tullus Hostilius in Dionysius of Halicarnassus &quot;Roman Antiquities&quot; IV 22.

&quot;perca arsmatia&quot; VIa 19: &quot;virga ritualis&quot;, &quot;ritual (and/or military) rod.&quot;

&quot;perne postne sepse sarsite uouse auie esone&quot; VIb 11: &quot;antice postice septe sarcte voce (et) ave (i. e. auspicio) divina&quot;, &quot;from before and behind, clear and cut (fully, wholly) voice and bird sacred.&quot; Or &quot;...voto, augurio, sacrificio&quot; &quot;by vow, auspice and sacrifice.&quot;

&quot;peiqu&quot;: &quot;picus&quot; &quot;woodpecker&quot;; &quot;peica&quot; perhaps &quot;magpie;&quot; &quot;parfa&quot;: &quot;parrha&quot;, perhaps &quot;oxifraga&quot; or &quot;upupa/hoopoe&quot;; &quot;curnace&quot;: &quot;cornix&quot;, &quot;crow&quot; (VIa 1 etc.).

&quot;prinovatus&quot;: &quot;legatus&quot;, assistant to the &quot;arsfertur&quot;, possibly &quot;agrimensor&quot;, land-surveyor: probably from Greek πρινος, Celtic &quot;prinni&quot; oakwood.
&quot;percaf poniçate&quot; Ib 15; &quot;perca poniçiater&quot; VIb 51: &quot;virgas Punicae-mali&quot; &quot;rods,&quot; wands of pomegranate wood.

&quot;fato fito&quot; VIb 11: it looks &quot;fito&quot; had an active meaning in Umbrian, i.e. &quot;(having) become&quot;; &quot;fato&quot; has been interpreted as a passive past participle of a verb corresponding to Latin &quot;fateor&quot;, thence &quot;fato fito&quot;: having become defined by utterance.

==Topography==

Studies have been devoted recently to identifying the location of the rituals described in the tablets, particularly of the &quot;Fisian Arx&quot;, which has been placed with certainty on Monte Ingino, to the southwest of Gubbio.

==Text samples==

===From Tablets III and IV===

===From Tablet VI===

Here is the fuller text of Tablet VI a 22-34, being the first of three very repetitive and formulaic prayers that the head/officiating priest. (arsfertur = &quot;the one who carries [the sacred fire] to [the altar]) is instructed to say during the libation (line numbers in parentheses) Note that there is no punctuation in the original texts:

The chiastic--AB...BA--envelope construction, beginning with &quot;Thee I invoke ... JG,&quot; and ending &quot;JG, Thee I invoke&quot; probably was a stylistic way to clearly mark that this was the end of the complete first prayer, to be followed by the second (below, ll. 35-44) and third (ll. 45-55) essentially identical prayers, both capping with the same phrase, and notably with the verb separated from the phrase at the opening of each of the next two prayers.

Note that &quot;veiro pequo...salua seritu&quot; &quot;the men and cattle...keep safe&quot; in lines 32-33 matches Latin &quot;pastores pecua salua seruassis&quot; &quot;the herdsmen and cattle...keep safe&quot; (in Varro, &quot;Rerum Rusticarum&quot; 2.1.12), and further afield, Avestan θrāθrāi pasuuå: viraiiå: &quot;for the protection of cattle [and] men&quot; (&quot;Yasht&quot; 13.10), suggesting that some form of the formula goes back to Proto-Indo-European.

<text>The milk snake or milksnake (Lampropeltis triangulum), is a species of kingsnake; 24 subspecies are currently recognized. &quot;Lampropeltis elapsoides&quot;, the scarlet kingsnake, was formerly classified as a 25th subspecies (&quot;L. t. elapsoides&quot;), but is now recognized as a distinct species. The subspecies have strikingly different appearances, and many of them have their own common names. Some authorities suggest that this species could be split into several separate species. They are not venomous to humans.

==Geographic range==
Milk snakes can be found from the southeastern extreme of Ontario, Canada, from southeastern Maine and all the states of the Eastern Seaboard, south to Florida, Alabama, Mississippi; in the midwest, from central Minnesota to Colorado, Nebraska, and the Dakotas; they are found in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains; Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana. There are further subspecies found in nearly all of Mexico, from the state of Sonora east to the Gulf coast of Tamaulipas and throughout the rest of south and central Mexico; all through Central America and into Colombia and Ecuador.

==Habitat==
Across the wide range of this species, habitat varies; typically, milk snakes prefer to live in forested regions or areas of open woodland. However, they can also be found in swamps, prairie, farmland, rocky slopes, some semi-arid/chaparral areas, and sand dunes/beaches. In some situations, milk snakes also migrate seasonally; during the winter, they may move to higher/drier habitats for hibernation, and then moister habitats in time for the summer. Depending on subspecies, milk snakes enter hibernation from late October or November to mid-April.

==Description==
There is a significant amount of variation among milk snakes in terms of size. Depending on subspecies, they can be as small as 14&quot; (36 cm) or as large as 72&quot; (183 cm) long. Adults in the wild apparently average from in North America. However, unusually large milk snakes can become rather bulkier than average-sized adults and potentially weigh up to , though high weights as such are generally reported from captivity. Males typically are larger than females in maturity, although females can be bulkier than males similar in length as well. Generally more tropical populations, from Mexico and further south, reach larger adult sizes than milk snakes living in the temperate zones.

Milk snakes have smooth and shiny scales and their typical color pattern is alternating bands of red-black-yellow or white-black-red; however, red blotches instead of bands are seen in some populations. Some milk snakes have a striking resemblance to coral snakes, in Batesian mimicry, which likely scares away potential predators. Both milk snakes and coral snakes possess transverse bands of red, black, and yellow. Experts now recognize that common mnemonics that people use to distinguish between the deadly coral snake and the harmless milk snake are not 100% reliable. Some coral snakes do not have the typical banding colors or patterns. Examples of unreliable mnemonics commonly used:

* &quot;Red on yellow kill a fellow. Red on black venom lack&quot;
* &quot;Red touches black, it&#x27;s a friend of Jack. Red touches yellow, it&#x27;s bad for a fellow.&quot;


Due to the many colors of the eastern milk snake (&quot;L. t. triangulum&quot;), it can resemble the coral snake, corn snake, fox snake, scarlet snake, and most importantly, the venomous snake genera &quot;Agkistrodon&quot; and &quot;Sistrurus&quot;. Milk, fox, and scarlet snakes are killed because of a resemblance to the venomous pygmy rattlers. Juvenile milk snakes, which are more reddish than adults, are often killed because they are mistaken for copperheads. Enough distinction exists among the five to make the eastern milk snake fairly easy to identify. The eastern milk snakes also have a light-colored V-shaped or Y-shaped patch on their necks. One subspecies, &quot;L. t. gaigeae&quot;, is melanistic (almost all black) as an adult.

==Behavior==
Milk snakes are mostly nocturnal, especially during summer months. They are primarily terrestrial and attempt to blend in with ground litter. However, they are able to climb and swim. These snakes tend to be secretive and remain hidden. When threatened, a milk snake will usually first try to escape. If cornered or harassed, it may vibrate its tail and strike energetically, though they are non-venomous, have only tiny teeth and their tails lack a rattle. Unless frightened, milk snakes move slowly. They are often fairly docile.

==Diet==
Young milk snakes typically eat crickets and other insects, slugs, and earthworms; in the western U.S., juveniles also feed on small lizards and other young snakes. Adults&#x27; diet is primarily small mammals, but frequently includes lizards (especially skinks). They are also known to eat birds and their eggs, frogs, fish, and other snakes (including venomous species like coral snakes and rattlesnakes) and their eggs.

Milk snakes are much more opportunistic eaters than the fox snake or corn snake. Although the diet of adult milk snakes primarily consists of rodents (such as voles, mice, and rats), they also have been known to consume a variety of other animals: birds and their eggs, other reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates.

They are nocturnal hunters and are often found resting during the day in old barns and under wood. An old fable about milk snakes is that they suck cow udders to get milk. The story is entirely false, and is discredited by the fact that the milk snake is not physically capable of sucking milk from a cow&#x27;s udder; however, milk snakes &quot;are&quot; frequently found in and around barns, making use of the cool and dark environment for a resting-place during the day, and the easily accessible infestations of rodents for a convenient food supply. This preference for barns, and consequently the company of cows, presumably gave rise to the fable.

==Reproduction==
Milk snakes are oviparous, laying an average of about 10 eggs per clutch, although that number may vary by region. The milk snake mates from early May to late June. In June and July, the female lays three to 24 eggs beneath logs, boards, rocks, and rotting vegetation. The eggs are oval in shape, and white in color. Eggs range from 2.5 cm to 4.2 cm (1 to 1.7 in) in length. The eggs incubate for about two months, and hatch around August or September. The average hatchling in Virginia measures in total length and weighs .

Milk snakes typically live around 12 years, or up to 21 years in captivity. They reach maturity within three or four years.

==Conservation status==
The milk snake is listed as of least concern by the IUCN (a wildlife conservation union), but in some areas, they may face significant pressure due to pet-trade collection. Because of this species&#x27; attractiveness in the pet trade, many subspecies are now being bred in captivity for sale.

<text>Edward Lee Morgan (July 10, 1938 – February 19, 1972) was an American jazz trumpeter and composer. One of the key hard bop musicians of the 1960s and a cornerstone of the Blue Note label, Morgan came to prominence in his late teens, recording with bandleaders like John Coltrane, Curtis Fuller, Dizzy Gillespie, Hank Mobley and Wayne Shorter, and playing in Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers.

Morgan stayed with Blakey until 1961 and started to record as leader in the late &#x27;50s. Morgan&#x27;s solo recordings often alternated between conventional hard bop sessions and more adventurous post-bop and avant-garde experiments, many of which did not see release during his lifetime. His composition &quot;The Sidewinder&quot;, on the album of the same name, became a surprise crossover hit on the pop and R&amp;B charts in 1964. After a second stint in Blakey&#x27;s band, Morgan continued to work prolifically as both a leader and a sideman until his death in 1972.

==Biography==
Edward Lee Morgan was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, on July 10, 1938, the youngest of Otto Ricardo and Nettie Beatrice Morgan&#x27;s four children.

Originally interested in the vibraphone, he soon showed a growing enthusiasm for the trumpet. Morgan could also play the alto saxophone. On his thirteenth birthday, his sister Ernestine gave him his first trumpet. His primary stylistic influence was Clifford Brown, with whom he took a few lessons as a teenager.

Morgan recorded prolifically from 1956 until a day before his death in February 1972. He joined Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s Big Band at 18 and remained as a member for a year and a half until economic circumstances forced Gillespie to disband the unit in 1958. Morgan began recording for Blue Note in 1956, eventually recording 25 albums as a leader for the label. He also recorded on the Vee-Jay label and one album for Riverside Records on its short-lived Jazzland subsidiary. He was a featured sideman on several early Hank Mobley records, and intermittently thereafter. On John Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;Blue Train&quot; (1957), Morgan played a trumpet with an angled bell given to him by Gillespie.

Joining Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers in 1958, Morgan further developed his talent as a soloist and composer. He toured with Blakey for a few years, and was featured on numerous albums by the Messengers, including &quot;Moanin&#x27;&quot;, which is one of the band&#x27;s best-known recordings. When Benny Golson left the Jazz Messengers, Morgan persuaded Blakey to hire Wayne Shorter, a young tenor saxophonist, to fill the chair. This version of the Jazz Messengers, including pianist Bobby Timmons and bassist Jymie Merritt, recorded many albums during 1959–61, including for Blue Note &quot;Africaine,&quot; &quot;The Big Beat&quot;, &quot;A Night in Tunisia&quot; and &quot;The Freedom Rider&quot;. During his time with The Jazz Messengers, Morgan also wrote several tunes including &quot;The Midget&quot;, &quot;Haina&quot;, &quot;Celine&quot;, &quot;Yama,&quot; &quot;Kozo&#x27;s Waltz&quot;, &quot;Pisces&quot;, and &quot;Blue Lace.&quot; The drug problems of Morgan and Timmons forced them to leave the band in 1961, and the trumpeter returned to Philadelphia, his hometown. According to Tom Perchard, a Morgan biographer, it was Blakey who introduced the trumpeter to heroin, which impeded progression in his career. 
On returning to New York in 1963, he recorded &quot;The Sidewinder&quot;. The title track cracked the pop chart in 1964 and served as the background theme for Chrysler television commercials during the World Series. The tune was used without Morgan&#x27;s consent; after he threatened to sue, Chrysler agreed not to show the advertisement again and settled the case. Due to the crossover success of &quot;The Sidewinder&quot; in a rapidly changing pop music market, Blue Note encouraged its other artists to emulate the tune&#x27;s &quot;boogaloo&quot; beat. Morgan himself repeated the formula several times with compositions such as &quot;Cornbread&quot; (from the eponymous album &quot;Cornbread&quot;) and &quot;Yes I Can, No You Can&#x27;t&quot; on &quot;The Gigolo&quot;. According to drummer Billy Hart, Morgan said he had recorded &quot;The Sidewinder&quot; as filler for the album, and was bemused that it had turned into his biggest hit. He felt that his playing was much more advanced on Grachan Moncur III&#x27;s essentially avant-garde &quot;Evolution&quot; album, recorded a month earlier, on November 21, 1963.

After this commercial success, Morgan continued to record prolifically, producing such works as &quot;Search for the New Land&quot; (1964), which reached the top 20 of the R&amp;B charts. He also briefly rejoined the Jazz Messengers after his successor, Freddie Hubbard, joined another group. Together with tenor saxophonist John Gilmore, pianist John Hicks, and bassist Victor Sproles, this lineup was filmed by the BBC for seminal jazz television program &quot;Jazz 625&quot;.

As the 1960s progressed, he recorded some twenty additional albums as a leader, and continued to record as a sideman on the albums of other artists, including Wayne Shorter&#x27;s &quot;Night Dreamer&quot;; Stanley Turrentine&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Natural&quot;; Freddie Hubbard&#x27;s &quot;The Night of the Cookers&quot;; Hank Mobley&#x27;s &quot;Dippin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;A Caddy for Daddy&quot;, &quot;A Slice of the Top&quot;, &quot;Straight No Filter&quot;; Jackie McLean&#x27;s &quot;Jackknife&quot; and &quot;Consequence&quot;; Joe Henderson&#x27;s &quot;Mode for Joe&quot;; McCoy Tyner&#x27;s &quot;Tender Moments&quot;; Lonnie Smith&#x27;s &quot;Think&quot; and &quot;Turning Point&quot;; Elvin Jones&#x27; &quot;The Prime Element&quot;; Jack Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Easterly Winds&quot;; Reuben Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Love Bug&quot;; Larry Young&#x27;s &quot;Mother Ship&quot;; &quot;Lee Morgan and Clifford Jordan Live in Baltimore 1968&quot;; Andrew Hill&#x27;s &quot;Grass Roots&quot;; as well as on several albums with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers.

He became more politically involved in the last two years of his life, becoming one of the leaders of the Jazz and People&#x27;s Movement. The group demonstrated during the taping of talk and variety shows during 1970-71 to protest the lack of jazz artists as guest performers and members of the programs&#x27; bands. His working band during those last years featured reed players Billy Harper or Bennie Maupin, pianist Harold Mabern, bassist Jymie Merritt and drummers Mickey Roker or Freddie Waits. Maupin, Mabern, Merritt, and Roker are featured on the well-regarded three-disc, &quot;Live at the Lighthouse&quot;, recorded during a two-week engagement at the Hermosa Beach club, California, in July 1970.

==Death and legacy==
Morgan was killed in the early hours of February 19, 1972, at Slugs&#x27; Saloon, a jazz club in New York City&#x27;s East Village where his band was performing. Following an altercation between sets, Morgan&#x27;s live-in girlfriend, Helen Moore, shot him. The injuries were not immediately fatal, but the ambulance was slow in arriving on the scene as the city had experienced heavy snowfall that resulted in extremely difficult driving conditions. They took so long to get there that Morgan bled to death. He was 33 years old. Moore was arrested and spent a short time in prison before being released on parole. After her release, she returned to her native North Carolina and died there from a heart condition in March 1996.

Morgan and Moore are the subjects of a 2016 documentary &quot;I Called Him Morgan&quot; by Swedish filmmaker Kasper Collin. The film premiered on September 1, 2016, at the 73rd Venice Film Festival and was theatrically released in the U.S. on March 24, 2017. In his &quot;New York Times&quot; review A. O. Scott called the film &quot;a delicate human drama about love, ambition and the glories of music&quot;.

<doc id="241545" wikidata="Q1928222" url="?curid=241545" title="Modula-3">
<text>Modula-3 is a programming language conceived as a successor to an upgraded version of Modula-2 known as Modula-2+. It has been influential in research circles (influencing the designs of languages such as Java, C#, Python and Nim), but it has not been adopted widely in industry. It was designed by Luca Cardelli, James Donahue, Lucille Glassman, Mick Jordan (before at the Olivetti Software Technology Laboratory), Bill Kalsow and Greg Nelson at the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Systems Research Center (SRC) and the Olivetti Research Center (ORC) in the late 1980s.

Modula-3&#x27;s main features are modularity, simplicity and safety while preserving the power of a systems-programming language. Modula-3 aimed to continue the Pascal tradition of type safety, while introducing new constructs for practical real-world programming. In particular Modula-3 added support for generic programming (similar to templates), multithreading, exception handling, garbage collection, object-oriented programming, partial revelation, and explicit marking of unsafe code. The design goal of Modula-3 was a language that implements the most important features of modern imperative programming languages in quite basic forms. Thus allegedly dangerous and complicating features such as multiple inheritance and operator overloading were omitted.

==Historical development==
The Modula-3 project started in November 1986 when Maurice Wilkes wrote to Niklaus Wirth with some ideas for a new version of Modula. Wilkes had been working at DEC just prior to this point, and had returned to England and joined Olivetti&#x27;s Research Strategy Board. Wirth had already moved on to Oberon, but had no problems with Wilkes&#x27;s team continuing development under the Modula name. The language definition was completed in August 1988, and an updated version in January 1989. Compilers from DEC and Olivetti soon followed, and 3rd party implementations after that.

Its design was heavily influenced by work on the Modula-2+ language in use at SRC and at the Acorn Computers Research Center (ARC, later ORC when Olivetti acquired Acorn) at the time, which was the language in which the operating system for the DEC Firefly multiprocessor VAX workstation was written and in which the Acorn Compiler for Acorn C and Modula Execution Library (CAMEL) at ARC for the ARX operating system project of ARM based Acorn Archimedes range of computers was written. As the revised Modula-3 Report states, the language was influenced by other languages such as Mesa, Cedar, Object Pascal, Oberon and Euclid.

During the 1990s, Modula-3 gained considerable currency as a teaching language, but it was never widely adopted for industrial use. Contributing to this may have been the demise of DEC, a key Modula-3 supporter (especially when it ceased to maintain it effectively before DEC was sold to Compaq in 1998). In any case, in spite of Modula-3&#x27;s simplicity and power, it appears that there was little demand for a procedural compiled language with restricted implementation of object-oriented programming. For a time, a commercial compiler named CM3 maintained by one of the chief implementors prior at DEC SRC who was hired before DEC being sold to Compaq, an integrated development environment (IDE) named Reactor and an extensible Java virtual machine (licensed in binary code and source code formats and buildable with Reactor) were offered by Critical Mass, Inc., but that company ceased active operations in 2000 and gave some of the source code of its products to Software Solutions GmbH. Modula-3 is now taught in universities mostly in comparative programming language courses, and its textbooks are out of print. Essentially the only corporate supporter of Modula-3 is , which inherited the sources from Critical Mass and has since made several releases of the CM3 system in source and binary code. The Reactor IDE has been open source released after several years it had not, with the new name CM3-IDE. In March 2002, also took over the repository of another active Modula-3 distribution, PM3, until then maintained at the École Polytechnique de Montréal but which later continued by the work on HM3 improved over the years later until it was obsoleted.

==Syntax==

A common example of a language&#x27;s syntax is the &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program.
MODULE Main; 
IMPORT IO;
BEGIN
 IO.Put(&quot;Hello World\n&quot;)
END Main.
All programs in Modula-3 have at least a module file, while most also include an interface file that is used by clients to access data from the module. As in some other languages, a Modula-3 program must export a Main module, which can either be a file named Main.m3, or a file can call codice_1 to export the Main module. MODULE Foo EXPORTS Main Module file names are advised to be the same as the name in source code. If they differ, the compiler only emits a warning.

Other conventions in the syntax include naming the exported type of an interface codice_2, since types are usually qualified by their full names, so a type codice_2 inside a module named Foo will be named codice_4. This aids in readability. Another similar convention is naming a public object codice_5 as in the OOP examples below.

==Language features==

===Modularity===
First and foremost, all compiled units are either codice_6 or implementation codice_7s, of one flavor or another. An interface compiled unit, starting with the keyword codice_6, defines constants, types, variables, exceptions, and procedures. The implementation module, starting with the keyword codice_7, provides the code, and any further constants, types, or variables needed to implement the interface. By default, an implementation module will implement the interface of the same name, but a module may explicitly codice_1 to a module not of the same name. For example, the main program exports an implementation module for the Main interface.
MODULE HelloWorld EXPORTS Main; 
IMPORT IO;
BEGIN
 IO.Put(&quot;Hello World\n&quot;)
END HelloWorld.
Any compiled unit may codice_11 other interfaces, although circular imports are forbidden. This may be resolved by doing the import from the implementation MODULE. The entities within the imported module may be imported, instead of only the module name, using the codice_12 syntax:
MODULE HelloWorld EXPORTS Main; 
FROM IO IMPORT Put;
BEGIN
 Put(&quot;Hello World\n&quot;)
END HelloWorld.
Typically, one only imports the interface, and uses the &#x27;dot&#x27; notation to access the items within the interface (similar to accessing the fields within a record). A typical use is to define one data structure (record or object) per interface along with any support procedures. Here the main type will get the name &#x27;T&#x27;, and one uses as in codice_13.

In the event of a name collision between an imported module and other entity within the module, the reserved word
codice_14 can be used as in codice_15

===Safe vs unsafe===
Some ability is deemed unsafe, where the compiler can no longer guarantee that results will be consistent; for example, when interfacing to the C language. The keyword codice_16 prefixed in front of codice_6 or codice_7, may be used to tell the compiler to enable certain low level features of the language. For example, an unsafe operation is bypassing the type system using codice_19 to copy the bits of an integer into a floating point codice_20 number.

An interface that imports an unsafe module must also be unsafe. A safe interface may be exported by an unsafe implementation module. This is the typical use when interfacing to external libraries, where two interfaces are built: one unsafe, the other safe.

===Generics===
A generic interface and its corresponding generic module, 
prefix the codice_6 or codice_7 keyword with codice_23, and take as formal arguments other interfaces. Thus (like C++ templates) one can easily define and use abstract data types, but unlike C++, the granularity is at the module level. An interface is passed to the generic interface and implementation modules as arguments, and the compiler will generate concrete modules.

For example, one could define a GenericStack, then instantiate it with interfaces such as codice_24, or codice_25, or even interfaces to Objects, as long as each of those interfaces defines the properties needed by the generic modules.

The bare types codice_26, or codice_20 can&#x27;t be used, because they are not modules, and the system of generics is based on using modules as arguments. By comparison, in a C++ template, a bare type would be used.

FILE: IntegerElem.i3
INTERFACE IntegerElem;
CONST Name = &quot;Integer&quot;;
TYPE T = INTEGER;
PROCEDURE Format(x: T): TEXT;
PROCEDURE Scan(txt: TEXT; VAR x: T): BOOLEAN;
END IntegerElem.
FILE: GenericStack.ig
GENERIC INTERFACE GenericStack(Element);
(* Here Element.T is the type to be stored in the generic stack. *)
TYPE
 T = Public OBJECT;
 Public = OBJECT
 METHODS
 init(): TStack;
 format(): TEXT;
 isEmpty(): BOOLEAN;
 count(): INTEGER;
 push(elm: Element.T);
 pop(VAR elem: Element.T): BOOLEAN;
 END;
END GenericStack.
FILE: GenericStack.mg
GENERIC MODULE GenericStack(Element);
&lt; ... generic implementation details... &gt;
PROCEDURE Format(self: T): TEXT =
VAR
 str: TEXT;
BEGIN
 str := Element.Name &amp; &quot;Stack{&quot;;
 FOR k := 0 TO self.n -1 DO
 IF k &gt; 0 THEN str := str &amp; &quot;, &quot;; END;
 str := str &amp; Element.Format(self.arr[k]);
 END;
 str := str &amp; &quot;};&quot;;
 RETURN str;
END Format;
&lt; ... more generic implementation details... &gt;
END GenericStack.
FILE: IntegerStack.i3
INTERFACE IntegerStack = GenericStack(IntegerElem) END IntegerStack.
FILE: IntegerStack.m3
MODULE IntegerStack = GenericStack(IntegerElem) END IntegerStack.
===Traceability===
Any identifier can be traced back to where it originated, unlike the &#x27;include&#x27; feature of other languages. A compiled unit must import identifiers from other compiled units, using an codice_11 statement. Even enumerations make use of the same &#x27;dot&#x27; notation as used when accessing a field of a record.
INTERFACE A;

TYPE Color = {Black, Brown, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet, Gray, White};

END A;
MODULE B;

IMPORT A;
FROM A IMPORT Color;

VAR
 aColor: A.Color; (* Uses the module name as a prefix *)
 theColor: Color; (* Does not have the module name as a prefix *)
 anotherColor: A.Color;

BEGIN
 aColor := A.Color.Brown;
 theColor := Color.Red;
 anotherColor := Color.Orange; (* Can&#x27;t simply use Orange *)
END B.
===Dynamic allocation===
Modula-3 supports the allocation of data at runtime. There are two kinds of memory that can be allocated, codice_29 and codice_30, the difference being whether the garbage collector can see it or not. codice_31 is used to allocate data of either of these classes of memory. In an codice_16 module, codice_33 is available to free untraced memory.

===Object-oriented===
Object-oriented programming techniques may be used in Modula-3, but their use is not a requirement. Many of the other features provided in Modula-3 (modules, generics) can usually take the place of object-orientation.

Object support is intentionally kept to its simplest terms. An object type (termed a &quot;class&quot; in other object-oriented languages) is introduced with the codice_34 declaration, which has essentially the same syntax as a codice_35 declaration, although an object type is a reference type, whereas RECORDs in Modula-3 are not (similar to structs in C). Exported types are usually named T by convention, and create a separate &quot;Public&quot; type to expose the methods and data. For example:
INTERFACE Person;

TYPE T &lt;: Public;
 Public = OBJECT 
 METHODS
 getAge(): INTEGER;
 init(name: TEXT; age: INTEGER): T;
 END;

END Person.

This defines an interface codice_36 with two types, codice_2, and codice_5, which is defined as an object with two methods, codice_39 and codice_40. codice_2 is defined as a subtype of codice_5 by the use of the codice_43 operator.

To create a new codice_44 object, use the built in procedure codice_45 with the method codice_40 as 

VAR jim := NEW(Person.T).init(&quot;Jim&quot;, 25);
=== Revelation ===
Modula-3&#x27;s codice_47 construct provides a conceptually simple and clean yet very powerful mechanism for hiding implementation details from clients, with arbitrarily many levels of &quot;friendliness&quot;. A full revelation of the form codice_48 can be used to show the full implementation of the codice_36 interface from above. A partial revelation of the form codice_50 merely reveals that T is a supertype of V without revealing any additional information on T.
MODULE Person;

REVEAL T = Public BRANDED 
OBJECT 
 name: TEXT; (* These two variables *)
 age: INTEGER; (* are private. *)
OVERRIDES
 getAge := Age;
 init := Init;
END;

PROCEDURE Age(self: T): INTEGER =
 BEGIN
 RETURN self.age;
 END Age;

PROCEDURE Init(self: T; name: TEXT; age: INTEGER): T =
 BEGIN
 self.name := name;
 self.age := age;
 RETURN self;
 END Init;

BEGIN
END Person.
Note the use of the codice_51 keyword, which &quot;brands&quot; objects to make them unique as to avoid structural equivalence. codice_51 can also take a string as an argument, but when omitted, a unique string is generated for you.

Modula-3 is one of a few programming languages which requires external references from a module to be strictly qualified. That is, a reference in module codice_53 to the object codice_54 exported from module codice_55 must take the form codice_56. In Modula-3, it is impossible to import &quot;all exported names&quot; from a module.

Because of the language&#x27;s requirements on name qualification and method overriding, it is impossible to break a working program simply by adding new declarations to an interface (any interface). This makes it possible for large programs to be edited concurrently by many programmers with no worries about naming conflicts; and it also makes it possible to edit core language libraries with the firm knowledge that no extant program will be &quot;broken&quot; in the process.

===Exceptions===
Exception handling is based on a codice_57...codice_58 block system, which has since become common. One feature that has not been adopted in other languages, with the notable exceptions of Delphi, Python, Scala and Visual Basic.NET, is that the codice_58 construct defined a form of switch statement with each possible exception as a case in its own EXCEPT clause. Modula-3 also supports a codice_60...codice_61...codice_62 construct that loops until an codice_61 occurs, a structure equivalent to a simple loop inside a codice_57...codice_58 clause.

===Multi-threaded===
The language supports the use of multi-threading, and synchronization between threads.
There is a standard module within the runtime library (&quot;m3core&quot;) named Thread, which supports the use of multi-threaded applications. The Modula-3 runtime may make use of a separate thread for internal tasks such as garbage collection.

A built-in data structure codice_66 is used to synchronize multiple threads and protect data structures from simultaneous access with possible corruption or race conditions. The codice_67 statement introduces a block in which the mutex is locked. Unlocking a codice_68 is implicit by the code execution locus&#x27;s leaving the block. The codice_68 is an object, and as such, other objects may be derived from it.

For example, in the input/output (I/O) section of the library &quot;libm3&quot;, readers and writers (Rd.T, and Wr.T) are derived from MUTEX, and they lock themselves before accessing or modifying any internal data such as buffers.
===Summary===
In summary, the language features:
*Modules and interfaces
*Explicit marking of unsafe code
*Generics
*Automatic garbage collection
*Strong typing, structural equivalence of types
*Objects
*Exceptions
*Threads

In &quot;Systems Programming with Modula-3&quot;, four essential points of the language design are intensively discussed. These topics are: structural vs. name equivalence, subtyping rules, generic modules, and parameter modes like codice_70.

==Standard library features==
Continuing a trend started with the C language, many of the features needed to write real programs were left out of the language definition and instead provided via a standard library set. Most of the interfaces below are described in detail in

Standard libraries providing the following features. These are called standard interfaces and are required (must be provided) in the language.
* Text: Operations on immutable string references, called codice_71s
* Thread: Operations relating to threading, including codice_68, condition variable, and thread pausing. The threading library provides pre-emptive threads switching
* Word: Bitwise operations on unsigned integers (or machine words). Normally implemented directly by the compiler
* Floating-point interfaces
Some recommended interfaces implemented in the available implementations but are not required
* Lex: For parsing number and other data
* Fmt: Formatting various datatypes for printing
* Pkl (or Pickle): Object serialization of any reference types reachable by the garbage collector
* Table: Generic modules for maps

As in C, I/O is also provided via libraries, in Modula-3 called codice_73 and codice_74. The object-oriented design of the Rd (readers) and Wr (writers) libraries is covered in detail in the book by Greg Nelson. An interesting aspect of Modula-3 is that it is one of few programming languages which standard libraries have been formally verified not to contain various types of bugs, including locking bugs. This was done under the auspices of the Larch/Modula-3 (see Larch family) and Extended static checking projects at DEC Systems Research Center.

==Implementations==
Several compilers are available, most of them open source.

*DEC-SRC M3, the original.
*Olivetti Research Center (ORC) Modula-3 toolkit, originally a compiler, now available as a library for syntactic, lexical and semantic analysis of Modula-3 programs.
*Critical Mass CM3, a different successor of DEC-SRC M3
*Polytechnique Montreal Modula-3 PM3, a successor of DEC-SRC M3, currently merging with CM3
*EzM3, an independent lightweight and easily portable implementation, developed in connection with CVSup
*HM3, a successor of the pm3-1.1.15 release of PM3, with support of native threading using NPTL
*CM3, the successor to Critical Mass CM3. This is the only up to date, maintained and developed implementation. Releases are available from http://www.opencm3.net/releng/.

Since the only aspect of C data structures that is missing from Modula-3 is the union type, all extant Modula-3 implementations are able to provide good binary code compatibility with C language type declarations of arrays and structs.

==Books==
None of these books are still in print, although used copies are obtainable and some are digitized, partly or fully, and some chapters of one them have prior or posterior versions obtainable as research reports from the web.

==Projects using Modula-3==
Software which is programmed with Modula-3 includes:
*The SPIN operating system
*The CVSup software repository synchronizing program
*The Obliq language, which uses Modula-3 network objects ability to migrate objects over local networks transparently, allowing a distributed ability to Modula-3 object-oriented programming paradigm. It has been used to build distributed applications, computer animations, and web programming applications in the form of scripting extension to Modula-3.

==Influences on other programming languages==
Although Modula-3 did not gain mainstream status, several parts of the DEC-SRC M3 distribution did. Probably the most influential part was the Network Objects library, which formed the basis for Java&#x27;s first Remote Method Invocation (RMI) implementation, including the network protocol. Only when Sun moved from the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) standard to the IIOP based protocol was it dropped. The Java documentation on garbage collection of remote objects still refer to the pioneering work done for Modula-3 Network Objects. Python&#x27;s implementation of classes was also inspired by the class mechanism found in C++ and Modula-3.
Also the language Nim makes use of some aspects of Modula-3, such as traced vs untraced pointers.

<doc id="241547" wikidata="Q206" url="?curid=241547" title="Stephen Harper">
<text>Stephen Joseph Harper (born April 30, 1959) is a Canadian politician who served as the 22nd prime minister of Canada from 2006 to 2015. He is to date the only prime minister to have come from the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada, serving as the party&#x27;s first leader from 2004 to 2015.

Harper studied economics, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1985 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1991 at the University of Calgary. He was one of the founders of the Reform Party of Canada and was first elected in 1993 in Calgary West. He did not seek re-election in the 1997 federal election, instead joining and later leading the National Citizens Coalition, a conservative lobbyist group. In 2002, he succeeded Stockwell Day as leader of the Canadian Alliance, the successor to the Reform Party, and returned to parliament as leader of the Official Opposition. In 2003, Harper negotiated the merger of the Canadian Alliance with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada to form the Conservative Party of Canada and was elected as the party&#x27;s first leader in March 2004. In the 2004 federal election, the new party lost its first election to the Liberal Party led by Paul Martin.

The 2006 federal election resulted in a minority government led by the Conservative Party with Harper becoming prime minister of Canada. During his first term, Harper confronted the In and Out scandal, reduced the goods and services tax to five percent, and passed the &quot;Federal Accountability Act&quot;, the Québécois nation motion, and the Veterans&#x27; Bill of Rights. After the 2008 federal election, in which the Conservatives won a larger minority, Harper prorogued Parliament to defeat a non-confidence motion by a potential coalition of opposition parties, passed the Economic Action Plan of major personal income tax cuts and infrastructure investments in response to the Great Recession, introduced the tax-free savings account, and ordered military intervention during the First Libyan Civil War. In March 2011, a no-confidence vote found his government to be in contempt of Parliament, triggering a federal election in which the Conservatives won a majority government. During his third term, Harper withdrew Canada from the Kyoto Protocol, launched Operation Impact in opposition to ISIL, privatized the Canadian Wheat Board, repealed the long-gun registry, passed the &quot;Anti-terrorism Act, 2015&quot;, launched Canada&#x27;s Global Markets Action Plan, and grappled with controversies surrounding the Canadian Senate expenses scandal and the Robocall scandal.

In the 2015 federal election, the Conservative Party lost power to the Liberal Party led by Justin Trudeau. Harper officially stepped down as party leader on October 19, 2015, and resigned his seat on August 26, 2016. Since then, Harper has taken on a number of international business and leadership roles, founding a global consulting firm, appearing in US and British media, and being elected leader of the International Democracy Union.

==Early life and education==
Harper was born and raised in Leaside, a neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, the first of three sons of Margaret (née Johnston) and Joseph Harris Harper, an accountant at Imperial Oil. The Harper family traces its ancestral roots back to Sledmere, a village in Yorkshire, England, with Harper&#x27;s 4th great-grandfather Christopher having emigrated to Nova Scotia in 1774, where he later served as justice of the peace in the area that is now New Brunswick.

Harper attended Northlea Public School and, later, John G. Althouse Middle School and Richview Collegiate Institute, both in Etobicoke, Toronto. He graduated from high school in 1978, and was a member of Richview Collegiate&#x27;s team on &quot;Reach for the Top&quot;, a televised academic quiz show for high school students. Harper studied at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Trinity College before moving to Alberta. In an attempt to establish independence from his parents, Harper dropped out of the University of Toronto and then moved to Edmonton, Alberta, where he found work in the mail room at Imperial Oil. Later, he advanced to work on the company&#x27;s computer systems. He took up post-secondary studies again at the University of Calgary, where he completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics in 1985. He later returned there to earn a master&#x27;s degree in economics, completed in 1991. Throughout his career, Harper has kept strong links to the University of Calgary. Trained as an economist, Harper was the first prime minister with an economics degree since Pierre Trudeau and the first prime minister without a law degree since Joe Clark.

==Political beginnings==
Harper became involved in politics as a member of his high school&#x27;s Young Liberals club. He later changed his political allegiance because he disagreed with the National Energy Program (NEP) of Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s Liberal government. He became executive assistant to Progressive Conservative (PC) Member of Parliament (MP) Jim Hawkes in 1985 but later became disillusioned with the party and the government of Brian Mulroney, citing the administration&#x27;s economic policy. He left the PC Party the next year.

Harper was then recommended by the University of Calgary&#x27;s economist Bob Mansell to Preston Manning, the founder and leader of the right-wing populist Reform Party of Canada. At that time, Harper &quot;didn&#x27;t see himself as a politician&quot;, Mansell told CBC News in 2002, adding, &quot;Politics was not his first love.&quot;

Manning invited him to participate in the party, and Harper gave a speech at Reform&#x27;s 1987 founding convention in Winnipeg. He became the Reform Party&#x27;s chief policy officer, and he played a major role in drafting the 1988 election platform, otherwise known as the Blue Book, which helped form the principles and policies of the party. Harper was influenced by his political mentor, Tom Flanagan, when writing the book. Harper is credited with creating Reform&#x27;s campaign slogan, &quot;The West wants in!&quot;

Harper ran for the House of Commons in the 1988 federal election in Calgary West and losing by a wide margin to Hawkes, his former employer. After Reform candidate Deborah Grey was elected as the party&#x27;s first MP in a 1989 by-election, Harper became Grey&#x27;s executive assistant, serving as her chief adviser and speechwriter until 1993. He remained prominent in the Reform Party&#x27;s national organization in his role as policy chief, encouraging the party to expand beyond its Western base and arguing that strictly regional parties were at risk of being taken over by radical elements. He delivered a speech at the Reform Party&#x27;s 1991 national convention, in which he condemned extremist views.

Harper&#x27;s relationship with Manning became strained in 1992, because of conflicting strategies over the Charlottetown Accord. Harper opposed the accord on principle for ideological reasons, while Manning was initially more open to compromise. Harper also criticized Manning&#x27;s decision to hire Rick Anderson as an adviser, believing that Anderson was not sufficiently committed to the Reform Party&#x27;s principles. Harper resigned as the policy chief in October 1992.

Harper stood for office again in the 1993 federal election and defeated Jim Hawkes amid a significant Reform breakthrough in Western Canada. The National Citizens Coalition (NCC) ran a $50,000 print and television campaign against Hawkes but did not endorse Harper directly.

==Reform Party MP (1993–1997)==
Harper emerged a prominent member of the Reform Party caucus. He was active on constitutional issues and played a prominent role in drafting the Reform Party&#x27;s strategy for the 1995 Quebec referendum. A long-standing opponent of centralized federalism, he stood with Preston Manning in Montreal to introduce a twenty-point plan to &quot;decentralize and modernize&quot; Canada in the event of a &quot;no&quot; victory. Harper later argued that the &quot;no&quot; side&#x27;s narrow plurality was a worst-case scenario, in that no-one had won a mandate for change.

Harper has expressed some socially conservative views on certain issues. In 1994, he opposed plans by federal Justice Minister Allan Rock to introduce spousal benefits for same-sex couples. Citing the recent failure of a similar initiative in Ontario, he was quoted as saying, &quot;What I hope they learn is not to get into it. There are more important social and economic issues, not to mention the unity question.&quot; Harper also spoke against the possibility of the Canadian Human Rights Commission or the Supreme Court changing federal policy in these and other matters.

At the Reform Party&#x27;s 1994 policy convention, Harper was part of a small minority of delegates who voted against restricting the definition of marriage to &quot;the union of one man and one woman&quot;. He opposed both same-sex marriage and mandated benefits for same-sex couples, but argued that political parties should refrain from taking official positions on these and other &quot;issues of conscience&quot;.

Harper was the only Reform MP to support the creation of the Canadian Firearms Registry at second reading in 1995, although he later voted against it at third reading stage. He said at the time that he initially voted for the registry because of a poll showing that most of his constituents supported it, and added that he changed his vote when a second poll showed the opposite result. It was reported in April 1995, that some Progressive Conservatives opposed to Jean Charest&#x27;s leadership wanted to remove both Charest and Manning, and unite the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties under Harper&#x27;s leadership.

Despite his prominent position in the party, Harper&#x27;s relationship with the Reform Party leadership was frequently strained. In early 1994, he criticized a party decision to establish a personal expense account for Manning at a time when other Reform MPs had been asked to forego parliamentary perquisites. He was formally rebuked by the Reform executive council despite winning support from some MPs. His relationship with Manning grew increasingly fractious in the mid-1990s, and he pointedly declined to express any opinion on Manning&#x27;s leadership during a 1996 interview. This friction was indicative of a fundamental divide between the two men: Harper was strongly committed to conservative principles and opposed Manning&#x27;s inclinations toward populism, which Harper saw as leading to compromise on core ideological matters.

These tensions culminated in late 1996 when Harper announced that he would not be a candidate in the next federal election. He resigned his parliamentary seat on January 14, 1997, the same day that he was appointed as a vice-president of the National Citizens Coalition (NCC), a conservative think-tank and advocacy group. He was promoted to NCC president later in the year.

In April 1997, Harper suggested that the Reform Party was drifting toward social conservatism and ignoring the principles of economic conservatism. The Liberal Party lost seats but managed to retain a narrow majority government in the 1997 federal election, while Reform made only modest gains.

==Out of parliament (1997–2001)==
Soon after leaving Parliament, Harper and Tom Flanagan co-authored an opinion piece entitled &quot;Our Benign Dictatorship&quot;, which argued that the Liberal Party only retained power through a dysfunctional political system and a divided opposition. Harper and Flanagan argued that federal conservative governments between 1917 and 1993 were founded on temporary alliances between Western populists and Quebec nationalists, and were unable to govern because of their fundamental contradictions. The authors called for an alliance of Canada&#x27;s conservative parties, and suggested that meaningful political change might require electoral reforms such as proportional representation. &quot;Our Benign Dictatorship&quot; also commended Conrad Black&#x27;s purchase of the Southam newspaper chain, arguing that his stewardship would provide for a &quot;pluralistic&quot; editorial view to counter the &quot;monolithically liberal and feminist&quot; approach of the previous management.

Harper remained active in constitutional issues. He was a prominent opponent of the Calgary Declaration on national unity in late 1997, describing it as an &quot;appeasement strategy&quot; against Quebec nationalism. He called for federalist politicians to reject this strategy, and approach future constitutional talks from the position that &quot;Quebec separatists are the problem and they need to be fixed&quot;. In late 1999, Harper called for the federal government to establish clear rules for any future Quebec referendum on sovereignty. Some have identified Harper&#x27;s views as an influence on the Chrétien government&#x27;s &quot;Clarity Act&quot;.

As president of the National Citizens Coalition (NCC) from 1998 to 2002, Harper launched an ultimately unsuccessful legal battle against federal election laws restricting third-party advertising. He led the NCC in several campaigns against the Canadian Wheat Board, and supported Finance Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s 2000 tax cuts as a positive first step toward tax reform.

In 1997, Harper delivered a controversial speech on Canadian identity to the Council for National Policy, a conservative American think tank. He made comments such as &quot;Canada is a Northern European welfare state in the worst sense of the term, and very proud of it&quot;, &quot;if you&#x27;re like all Americans, you know almost nothing except for your own country. Which makes you probably knowledgeable about one more country than most Canadians&quot;, and &quot;the NDP [New Democratic Party] is kind of proof that the Devil lives and interferes in the affairs of men.&quot; These statements were made public and criticized during the 2006 election. Harper argued that the speech was intended as humour, and not as serious analysis.

Harper considered campaigning for the Progressive Conservative Party leadership in 1998, after Jean Charest left federal politics. Among those encouraging his candidacy were senior aides to Ontario Premier Mike Harris, including Tony Clement and Tom Long. He eventually decided against running, arguing that it would &quot;burn bridges to those Reformers with whom I worked for many years&quot; and prevent an alliance of right-wing parties from taking shape. Harper was sceptical about the Reform Party&#x27;s United Alternative initiative in 1999, arguing that it would serve to consolidate Manning&#x27;s hold on the party leadership. He also expressed concern that the UA would dilute Reform&#x27;s ideological focus.

When the United Alternative created the Canadian Alliance in 2000 as a successor party to Reform, Harper predicted that Stockwell Day would defeat Preston Manning for the new party&#x27;s leadership. He expressed reservations about Day&#x27;s abilities, however, and accused Day of &quot;[making] adherence to his social views a litmus test to determine whether you&#x27;re in the party or not&quot;. Harper endorsed Tom Long for the leadership, arguing that Long was best suited to take support from the Progressive Conservative Party. When Day placed first on the first ballot, Harper said that the Canadian Alliance was shifting &quot;more towards being a party of the religious right&quot;.

After the death of Pierre Trudeau in 2000, Harper wrote an editorial criticizing Trudeau&#x27;s policies as they affected Western Canada. He wrote that Trudeau &quot;embraced the fashionable causes of his time, with variable enthusiasm and differing results&quot;, but &quot;took a pass&quot; on the issues that &quot;truly defined his century&quot;. Harper subsequently accused Trudeau of promoting &quot;unabashed socialism&quot;, and argued that Canadian governments between 1972 and 2002 had restricted economic growth through &quot;state corporatism&quot;.

After the Canadian Alliance&#x27;s poor showing in the 2000 election, Harper joined with other Western conservatives in co-authoring a document called the &quot;Alberta Agenda&quot;. The letter called on Alberta to reform publicly funded health care, replace the Canada Pension Plan with a provincial plan and replace the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with a provincial police force. It became known as the &quot;firewall letter&quot;, because it called on the provincial government to &quot;build firewalls around Alberta&quot; to stop the federal government from redistributing its wealth to less affluent regions. Alberta Premier Ralph Klein agreed with some of the letter&#x27;s recommendations, but distanced himself from the &quot;firewall&quot; comments.

Harper also wrote an editorial in late 2000 arguing that Alberta and the rest of Canada were &quot;embark[ing] on divergent and potentially hostile paths to defining their country&quot;. He said that Alberta had chosen the &quot;best of Canada&#x27;s heritage—a combination of American enterprise and individualism with the British traditions of order and co-operation&quot; while Canada &quot;appears content to become a second-tier socialistic country ... led by a second-world strongman appropriately suited for the task&quot;. He also called for a &quot;stronger and much more autonomous Alberta&quot;, while rejecting calls for separatism. In the 2001 Alberta provincial election, Harper led the NCC in a &quot;Vote Anything but Liberal&quot; campaign. Some articles from this period described him as a possible successor to Klein.

Harper and the NCC endorsed a private school tax credit proposed by Ontario&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government in 2001, arguing that it would &quot;save about $7,000 for each student who does not attend a union-run public school&quot;. Education Minister Janet Ecker criticized this, saying that her government&#x27;s intent was not to save money at the expense of public education.

Day&#x27;s leadership of the Canadian Alliance became increasingly troubled throughout the summer of 2001, as several party MPs called for his resignation. In June, the &quot;National Post&quot; newspaper reported that former Reform MP Ian McClelland was organizing a possible leadership challenge on Harper&#x27;s behalf. Harper announced his resignation from the NCC presidency in August 2001, to prepare a campaign.

==Leader of the Canadian Alliance (2002–2003)==
Stockwell Day called a new Canadian Alliance leadership race for 2002, and soon declared himself a candidate. Harper emerged as Day&#x27;s main rival, and declared his own candidacy on December 3, 2001. He eventually won the support of at least 28 Alliance MPs, including Scott Reid, James Rajotte and Keith Martin. During the campaign, Harper reprised his earlier warnings against an alliance with Quebec nationalists, and called for his party to become the federalist option in Quebec. He argued that &quot;the French language is not imperilled in Quebec&quot;, and opposed &quot;special status&quot; for the province in the Canadian constitution accordingly. He also endorsed greater provincial autonomy on Medicare, and said that he would not co-operate with the Progressive Conservatives as long as they were led by Joe Clark. On social issues, Harper argued for &quot;parental rights&quot; to use corporal punishment against their children and supported raising the age of sexual consent. He described his potential support base as &quot;similar to what George Bush tapped&quot;.

The tone of the leadership contest turned hostile in February 2002. Harper described Day&#x27;s governance of the party as &quot;amateurish&quot;, while his campaign team argued that Day was attempting to win re-election by building a narrow support base among different groups in the religious right. The Day campaign accused Harper of &quot;attacking ethnic and religious minorities&quot;. In early March, the two candidates had an especially fractious debate on CBC Newsworld. The leadership vote was held on March 20, 2002. Harper was elected on the first ballot with 55% support, against 37% for Day. Two other candidates split the remainder.

After winning the party leadership, Harper announced his intention to run for parliament in a by-election in Calgary Southwest, recently vacated by Preston Manning. Ezra Levant had been chosen as the riding&#x27;s Alliance candidate and declared that he would not stand aside for Harper; he later reconsidered. The Liberals did not field a candidate, following a parliamentary tradition of allowing opposition leaders to enter the House of Commons unopposed. The Progressive Conservative candidate, Jim Prentice, also chose to withdraw. Harper was elected without difficulty over |New Democrat Bill Phipps, a former United Church of Canada moderator. Harper told a reporter during the campaign that he &quot;despise[d]&quot; Phipps, and declined to debate him.

Harper officially became the leader of the Official Opposition in May 2002. Later in the same month, he said that the Atlantic Provinces were trapped in &quot;a culture of defeat&quot; which had to be overcome, the result of policies designed by Liberal and Progressive Conservative governments. Many Atlantic politicians condemned the remark as patronizing and insensitive. The Legislature of Nova Scotia unanimously approved a motion condemning Harper&#x27;s comments, which were also criticized by New Brunswick premier, Bernard Lord, federal Progressive Conservative leader Joe Clark and others. Harper refused to apologize, and said that much of Canada was trapped by the same &quot;can&#x27;t-do&quot; attitude.

In March 2003, their speeches in favour gaining no traction in Parliament, Harper and Stockwell Day co-wrote a letter to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in which they condemned the Canadian government&#x27;s unwillingness to participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

As party leader, Harper sought to merge the Alliance with the Progressive Conservatives (PCs) to create a united right-of-centre party. The possibility of a united conservative party increased after Peter Mackay was elected Progressive Conservative leader in May 2003. On October 16, 2003, Harper and Mackay agreed to merge the two parties to form the Conservative Party of Canada. After 95 percent of Alliance members voted in favour of merging with the PCs and 90 percent of 2,486 PC delegates voted in favour of merging with the Alliance, the Conservative Party of Canada was founded on December 7, 2003.

==Leader of the Conservative Party ==

On January 12, 2004, Harper announced his resignation as the leader of the Official Opposition in order to run for the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada. Harper was elected the first leader of the Conservative Party, with a first ballot majority against Belinda Stronach and Tony Clement on March 20, 2004. Harper&#x27;s victory included strong showings outside of Western Canada.

===2004 federal election===

Harper led the Conservatives into the 2004 federal election. Initially, new prime minister Paul Martin held a large lead in polls, but this eroded because of infighting, Adscam (a scandal that came as a result of a Government of Canada &quot;sponsorship program&quot; in the province of Quebec and involving the Liberal Party of Canada) and other scandals surrounding his government. The Liberals attempted to counter this with an early election call, as this would give the Conservatives less time to consolidate their merger.

This, along with an unpopular provincial budget by Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty in Ontario, moved the Conservatives into a lead for a time. However, comments by Conservative MPs, leaked press releases accusing the then prime minister of supporting child pornography, as well as attack ads suggesting that the Conservatives had a secret agenda, caused Harper&#x27;s party to lose some momentum.

The Liberals were re-elected to power with a minority government, with the Conservatives coming in second place. The Conservatives managed to make inroads into the Liberals&#x27; Ontario stronghold, primarily in the province&#x27;s socially conservative central region. However, they were shut out of Quebec, marking the first time that a centre-right party did not win any seats in that province. Harper, after some personal deliberation, decided to stay on as the party leader.

====Agreement with the BQ and the NDP====
Two months after the federal election, Harper privately met Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe and New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton in a Montreal hotel. On September 9, 2004, the three signed a letter addressed to the governor general, Adrienne Clarkson, stating, &quot;We respectfully point out that the opposition parties, who together constitute a majority in the House, have been in close consultation. We believe that, should a request for dissolution arise this should give you cause, as constitutional practice has determined, to consult the opposition leaders and consider all of your options before exercising your constitutional authority.&quot; On the same day the letter was written, the three party leaders held a joint press conference at which they expressed their intent to co-operate on changing parliamentary rules, and to request that the governor general consult with them before deciding to call an election. At the news conference, Harper said, &quot;It is the Parliament that&#x27;s supposed to run the country, not just the largest party and the single leader of that party. That&#x27;s a criticism I&#x27;ve had and that we&#x27;ve had and that most Canadians have had for a long, long time now so this is an opportunity to start to change that.&quot; At the time, Harper and the two other opposition leaders denied trying to form a coalition government. Harper said, &quot;This is not a coalition, but this is a co-operative effort.&quot;

On October 4, Mike Duffy, who was later appointed as a Conservative senator by Harper, said: &quot;It is possible that you could change prime minister without having an election.&quot; He added that some Conservatives wanted Harper to temporarily become prime minister without holding an election. The next day, Layton walked out on talks with Harper and Duceppe, accusing them of trying to replace Paul Martin with Harper as prime minister. Both Bloc and Conservative officials denied Layton&#x27;s accusations. On March 26, 2011, Duceppe stated that Harper had tried to form a coalition government with the Bloc and NDP in response to Harper&#x27;s allegations that the Liberals may form a coalition with the Bloc and the NDP.

===Leader of the Opposition===
The Conservative Party&#x27;s first policy convention was held from March 17 to 19, 2005, in Montreal. Harper had been rumoured to be shifting his ideology closer to that of a Blue Tory, and many thought he&#x27;d wanted to move the party&#x27;s policies closer to the centre. Any opposition to abortion or bilingualism was dropped from the Conservative platform. Harper received an 84% endorsement from delegates in the leadership review.

Despite the party abandoning debate over the two controversial issues, they began a concerted drive against same-sex marriage. Harper was criticized by a group of law professors for arguing that the government could override the provincial court rulings on same-sex marriage without using the &quot;notwithstanding clause&quot;, a provision of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. He also argued, in general, for lower taxes, an elected Senate, a tougher stance on crime, and closer relations with the United States.

Following the April 2005 release of Jean Brault&#x27;s damaging testimony at the Gomery Commission, implicating the Liberals in the scandal, opinion polls placed the Conservatives ahead of Liberals. The Conservatives had earlier abstained from the vote on the 2005 budget to avoid forcing an election. With the collapse in Liberal support and a controversial NDP amendment to the budget, the party exerted significant pressure on Harper to bring down the government. In May, Harper announced that Martin&#x27;s Liberals had lost the &quot;moral authority to govern&quot;. Shortly thereafter, the Conservatives and Bloc Québécois united to defeat the government on a vote that some considered to be either a confidence motion or else a motion requiring an immediate test of the confidence of the House. The Martin government did not accept this interpretation and argued that vote had been on a procedural motion, although they also indicated that they would bring forward their revised budget for a confidence vote the following week. Ultimately, the effort to bring down the Martin government failed following the decision of Conservative MP Belinda Stronach to cross the floor to the Liberal Party. The vote on the NDP amendment to the budget tied, and with the speaker of the House voting to continue the debate, the Liberals stayed in power. At the time, some considered the matter to be a constitutional crisis.

Harper was also criticized for supporting his caucus colleague MP Gurmant Grewal. Grewal had produced tapes of conversations with Tim Murphy, Paul Martin&#x27;s chief of staff, in which Grewal claimed he had been offered a cabinet position in exchange for his defection.

The Liberals&#x27; support dropped sharply after the first report from the Gomery Commission was issued, but rebounded soon after. Later that month, Harper introduced a motion of no confidence on the Martin government, telling the House of Commons &quot;that this government has lost the confidence of the House of Commons and needs to be removed&quot;. As the Liberals had lost NDP support in the house by refusing to accept an NDP plan to prevent health care privatization, the no-confidence motion was passed by a vote of 171–133. It was the first time that a Canadian government had been toppled by a straight motion of no confidence proposed by the opposition. As a result, Parliament was dissolved and a general election was scheduled for January 23, 2006.

On February 27, 2008, allegations surfaced that two Conservative Party officials offered terminally ill, independent MP Chuck Cadman a million-dollar life insurance policy in exchange for his vote to bring down the Liberal government in a May 2005, budget vote. If the story had been proved true, the actions may have been grounds for charges as a criminal offence as under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, it is illegal to bribe an MP.

When asked by Vancouver journalist Tom Zytaruk about the alleged life insurance offer then-opposition leader Stephen Harper states on an audio tape &quot;I don&#x27;t know the details. I know there were discussions&quot; and goes on to say &quot;The offer to Chuck was that it was only to replace financial considerations he might lose due to an election&quot;. Harper also stated that he had told the Conservative Party representatives that they were unlikely to succeed. &quot;I told them they were wasting their time. I said Chuck had made up his mind.&quot; In February 2008, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigated the allegations that Section 119&#x27;s provisions on bribery and corruption in the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; had been violated. The RCMP concluded their investigation stating that there was no evidence for pressing charges.

Harper denied any wrongdoing and subsequently filed a civil libel suit against the Liberal Party. Because libel laws do not apply to statements made in Parliament, the basis of the lawsuit was that statements made by Liberal Party members outside the House of Commons and in articles which appeared on the Liberal Party web site made accusations that Harper had committed a criminal act.

The audio expert hired by Harper to prove that the tape containing the evidence was doctored reported that the latter part of the tape was recorded over, but the tape was unaltered where Harper&#x27;s voice said &quot;I don&#x27;t know the details, I know that, um, there were discussions, um, but this is not for publication?&quot; and goes on to say he &quot;didn&#x27;t know the details&quot; when asked if he knew anything about the alleged offer to Cadman.

===2006 federal election===
The Conservatives began the campaign period with a policy-per-day strategy, contrary to the Liberal plan of holding off major announcements until after the Christmas holidays, so Harper dominated media coverage for the first weeks of the election. Though his party showed only modest movement in the polls, Harper&#x27;s personal numbers, which had always significantly trailed those of his party, began to rise. In response, the Liberals launched negative ads targeting Harper, similar to their attacks in the 2004 election. However, their tactics were not sufficient to erode the Conservative&#x27;s advantage, although they did manage to close what had been a ten-point advantage in public opinion. As Harper&#x27;s personal numbers rose, polls found he was now considered not only more trustworthy, but a better choice for prime minister than Martin.

Immediately prior to the Christmas break, in a faxed letter to NDP candidate Judy Wasylycia-Leis, RCMP commissioner Giuliano Zaccardelli announced the RCMP had opened a criminal investigation into her complaint that it appeared Liberal Finance Minister Ralph Goodale&#x27;s office had leaked information leading to insider trading before making an important announcement on the taxation of income trusts. On December 27, 2005, the RCMP confirmed that information in a press release. At the conclusion of the investigation, Serge Nadeau, a top civil servant in the Department of Finance, was charged with criminal breach of trust. No charges were laid against Goodale.

The election gave Harper&#x27;s Conservatives the largest number of seats in the House, although not enough for a majority government, and shortly after midnight on January 24, Martin conceded defeat. Later that day, Martin informed Governor General Michaëlle Jean that he would resign as prime minister, and at 6:45 p.m. Jean asked Harper to form a government. Harper was sworn in as Canada&#x27;s 22nd prime minister on February 6, 2006.

In his first address to Parliament as prime minister, Harper opened by paying tribute to the queen of Canada, Elizabeth II, and her &quot;lifelong dedication to duty and self-sacrifice&quot;. He also said before the Canada-UK Chamber of Commerce that Canada and the United Kingdom were joined by &quot;the golden circle of the Crown, which links us all together with the majestic past that takes us back to the Tudors, the Plantagenets, the Magna Carta, &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, petition of rights, and English common law&quot;. Journalist Graham Fraser said in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that Harper&#x27;s speech was &quot;one of the most monarchist speeches a Canadian prime minister has given since John Diefenbaker&quot;. An analysis by Michael D. Behiels suggested that a political realignment might be underway, based on the continuance of Harper&#x27;s government.

After the election, the Conservative party were charged with improper election spending, in a case that became known as the In and Out scandal. It dragged on for years, but in 2012 they took a plea deal, admitting both improper spending and falsifying records to hide it.

==Prime Minister of Canada (2006–2015)==
In July 2019, a group of independent academics published an assessment of past prime ministers of Canada based on the number of campaign pledges and promises fulfilled. According to the study, the Harper government fulfilled 85 per cent of its pledges (including partially-completed pledges). When factoring only completed, realized pledges, the Harper&#x27;s government, in their last year, kept 77 per cent of promises. The study found that the governments led by Harper, in addition to the government led by his successor, Justin Trudeau, had the highest rates of follow-through for campaign promises of any Canadian government in the last 35 years.

===Elections===
====2008 federal election====

On October 14, 2008, after a 5-week-long campaign, the Conservatives increased their seat count in Parliament to 143, up from 127 at the dissolution of the previous Parliament; however, the actual popular vote among Canadians dropped slightly by 167,494 votes. As a result of the lowest voter turnout in Canadian electoral history, this represented only 22% of eligible Canadian voters, the lowest level of support of any winning party in Canadian history. Meanwhile, the number of opposition Liberal MPs fell from 95 to 77 seats. 155 MPs are required to form a majority government in Canada&#x27;s 308-seat parliament, relegating Harper to minority government once again.

====2008 parliamentary dispute and prorogation====

On December 4, 2008, Harper asked Governor General Michaëlle Jean to prorogue Parliament to avoid a vote of confidence scheduled for the following Monday, becoming the first Canadian prime minister to do so. The request was granted by Jean, and the prorogation lasted until January 26, 2009. The opposition coalition dissolved shortly after, with the Conservatives winning a Liberal supported confidence vote on January 29, 2009.

====2010 prorogation====

On December 30, 2009, Harper announced that he would request the governor general to prorogue Parliament again, effective immediately on December 30, 2009, during the 2010 Winter Olympics and lasting until March 3, 2010. Harper stated that this was necessary for Canada&#x27;s economic plan. Jean granted the request. In an interview with CBC News, Prince Edward Island Liberal MP Wayne Easter accused the prime minister of &quot;shutting democracy down&quot;. Tom Flanagan, Harper&#x27;s University of Calgary mentor and former chief of staff, also questioned Harper&#x27;s reasoning for prorogation, stating that &quot;I think the government&#x27;s talking points haven&#x27;t been entirely credible&quot; and that the government&#x27;s explanation of proroguing was &quot;skirting the real issue—which is the harm the opposition parties are trying to do to the Canadian Forces&quot; regarding the Canadian Afghan detainee issue. Small demonstrations took place on January 23 in 64 Canadian cities and towns and five cities in other countries. A Facebook protest group attracted over 20,000 members.

A poll released by Angus Reid on January 7, found that 53 per cent of respondents were opposed to the prorogation, while 19 per cent supported it. 38 per cent believed Harper used the prorogation to curtail the Afghan detainee inquiry, while 23 per cent agreed with Harper&#x27;s explanation that the prorogation was necessary economically.

====2011 vote of no confidence====
Harper&#x27;s Cabinet was defeated in a no-confidence vote on March 25, 2011, after being found in contempt of Parliament. Harper thus, in accordance with constitutional convention, advised the governor general to call a general election. This was the first occurrence in Commonwealth history of a government in the Westminster parliamentary tradition losing the confidence of the lower house on the grounds of contempt of parliament. The no-confidence motion was carried with a vote of 156 in favour of the motion and 145 against.

====2011 federal election====

On May 2, 2011, after a five-week campaign, Harper led the Conservatives to their third consecutive election victory—the first time a centre-right party has accomplished this in half a century. The Conservatives increased their standing in parliament to 166, up from 143 at the dissolution of the previous parliament. This resulted in the first centre-right majority government since the Progressive Conservatives had won their last majority in 1988. The Conservatives also received a greater number of total votes than in 2008. Notably, the Conservatives had a significant breakthrough in southern Ontario, a region where neither they nor the Reform/Alliance side of the merger had done well in the previous two decades. They managed to win several seats in Toronto itself; no centre-right party had won seats in the former Metro Toronto since 1988.

The election ended five years of minority governments, made the New Democratic Party the Official Opposition for the first time, relegated the Liberals to third place for the first time, brought Elizabeth May as Canada&#x27;s first Green Party Member of Parliament, and reduced the Bloc Québécois from 47 to 4 seats.

After the election, the Conservatives were accused of cheating in the Robocall scandal, mainly suppressing votes by directing voters to bogus polling stations. There were complaints in 247 of Canada&#x27;s 308 ridings, but only one person was charged; Conservative staffer Michael Sona was convicted and jailed.

====2015 federal election====

Under the &quot;Canada Elections Act&quot;, a general election had to take place no later than October 19, 2015. On August 2, at Harper&#x27;s request, Governor General David Johnson dropped the writs of election for October 19. In that election, Harper&#x27;s Conservative Party was defeated by Justin Trudeau&#x27;s Liberals, and became the Official Opposition, dropping to only 99 seats out of 338. This was mainly because of a collapse of Conservative support in southern Ontario, a region that swung heavily to them in 2011. They lost all of their seats in Toronto, and won only three seats in the Greater Toronto Area. They were also shut out of Atlantic Canada—the first time in decades that there were no centre-right MPs from that region. Harper was re-elected in Calgary Heritage, essentially a reconfigured version of his former riding.

Hours after conceding defeat on election night, Harper resigned as leader of the Conservative Party and returned to the backbench. Former Cabinet minister Rona Ambrose was elected interim leader by the Conservative caucus, pending a formal leadership election. Harper resigned as prime minister during a meeting with Governor General David Johnston, who accepted the resignation, after which Johnston invited Trudeau to form a government on November 4, 2015. After Andrew Scheer resigned as Conservative leader in 2019, the &quot;National Post&quot; criticized Harper, by stating that he &quot;lost in 2015 in a way that left his party struggling to make any sense at all, including on deficits.&quot;

===Domestic and economic policy===

====Constitutional issues====
After sidestepping the political landmine for most of the first year of his time as prime minister, much as all the post-Charlottetown Accord prime ministers had done, Harper&#x27;s hand was forced to reopen the Quebec sovereignty debate after the opposition Bloc Québécois were to introduce a motion in the House that called for recognition of Quebec as a &quot;nation&quot;. On November 22, 2006, Harper introduced his own motion to recognize that &quot;the Québécois form a nation within a united Canada.&quot; Five days later, Harper&#x27;s motion passed, with a margin of 266–16; all federalist parties, and the Bloc Québécois, supported it.

In 2004, Harper said &quot;the Upper House remains a dumping ground for the favoured cronies of the prime minister&quot;. Between 2006 and 2008, by which time Harper was prime minister, he did not put any names to the governor general for appointment to the Senate, resulting in 16 Senate vacancies by the October 2008 election. The one exception was Michael Fortier. When Harper took office, he advised the governor general to appoint Michael Fortier to both the Senate and the Cabinet, arguing the government needed representation from the city of Montreal. Although there is a precedent for this action in Canadian history, the appointment led to criticism from opponents who claimed Harper was reneging on his push for an elected Senate. In 2008, Fortier gave up his Senate seat and sought election as an MP, but was defeated by a large margin by the incumbent Bloc Québécois MP.

After the October 2008, election, Harper again named Senate reform as a priority. By December, he recommended the appointment of 18 senators and, in 2009, provided an additional nine people for appointment as senators. Many of those appointed had close ties with the Conservative Party, including the campaign manager of the Conservative Party, Doug Finley. Critics accused Harper of hypocrisy (the Liberals coined the term &quot;Harpocrisy&quot;). Conservative senator Bert Brown defended Harper&#x27;s appointments and said &quot;the only way [the Senate]&#x27;s ever been filled is by having people that are loyal to the prime minister who&#x27;s appointing them&quot;.

====Economic management====
During Harper&#x27;s tenure, Canada had budgetary surpluses in 2006 and 2007 of $13.8 and $9.6 billion respectively. Following the 2008 financial crisis, Canada ran deficits from 2008–2013. The deficit was $55.6 billion in 2009 and was gradually lowered to $5.2 billion in 2013. Harper cut both the GST and corporate taxes aggressively. In 2014, the federal budget was balanced with a surplus of $1.9 billion. For 2015–2016, the federal government initially projected a $1.4-billion surplus. Following Harper&#x27;s defeat in the 2015 Canadian federal election and the change in party control, the 2015 fiscal year ended in a $1 billion deficit instead. In 2010, Canada had the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7 economies. &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine stated that Canada had come out the recession stronger than any other rich country in the G7. In 2013, Canada came out with Global Markets Action Plan to generate employment opportunities for Canadians.

====2011 Census====
Ahead of the Canada 2011 Census, the government announced that the long-form questionnaire (which collects detailed demographic information) will no longer be mandatory. According to Minister of Industry Tony Clement, the change was made because of privacy-related complaints and after consulting with Statistics Canada. However, the federal privacy commissioner reported only receiving three complaints between 1995 and 2010, according to a report in the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;.

Munir Sheikh, the chief statistician of Canada—appointed on Harper&#x27;s advice—resigned on July 21, 2010, in protest of the government&#x27;s change in policy. Ivan Fellegi, a former chief statistician, criticized the government&#x27;s decision, saying that those who are most vulnerable (such as the poor, new immigrants, and aboriginals) are least likely to respond to a voluntary form, which weakens information about their demographic.

The move was opposed by some governmental and non-governmental organizations. Federation of Canadian Municipalities; the Toronto government; Canadian Jewish Congress; Evangelical Fellowship of Canada; Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops; Canadian Medical Association; Statistical Society of Canada; the American Statistical Association; and Registered Nurses Association of Ontario all opposed the change. However, the Fraser Institute supported the change. The provincial governments of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Manitoba, also opposed the change.

====Veterans====
Under Harper, the annual budget of Veterans Affairs Canada increased from $2.85 billion in 2005–2006 to $3.55 billion in 2014–2015, while the quantity of veterans served has declined from 219,152 in 2008–2009 to 199,154 in 2015. Nine Veterans Affairs offices were closed between 2012 and 2015, and 900 positions were phased out from the department since 2009. Former-minister of veterans affairs Erin O&#x27;Toole stated that the closures were made to modernize the department, by moving services online and to Service Canada locations. In 2006, Harper implemented the New Veterans Charter passed with all party support by the previous Liberal government. This charter gave veterans the option to select a lump-sum payment, an annual installment over the number of years of a Veteran&#x27;s choosing, or a combination of these two payment options. Under Harper, the Canadian government spent $700,000 fighting a class-action lawsuit brought by a group of wounded Afghan veterans who argued that the new charter was discriminatory.

===Foreign policy===


During his term, Harper dealt with many foreign policy issues relating to the United States, the War on Terror, the Arab–Israeli conflict, free trade, China, and Africa.

He reduced defence spending to 1 per cent of Canadian GDP.

In 2009, Harper visited China. During the visit Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao publicly scolded Harper for not visiting earlier, pointing out that &quot;this is the first meeting between the Chinese premier and a Canadian prime minister in almost five years&quot;; Harper in response said that, &quot;it&#x27;s almost been five years since we had yourself or President Hu in our country.&quot; In 2008, former-prime minister Jean Chrétien had criticized Harper for missing opening ceremonies for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing; in response, Dimitri Soudas, a spokesperson for Harper, called the remarks hypocritical, pointing out that Chrétien &quot;attended one of six Olympic opening ceremonies during his 13 years as prime minister&quot;.

On September 11, 2007, Harper visited Australia and addressed its Parliament.

On January 20, 2014, Harper addressed the Israeli Knesset in Givat Ram, Jerusalem.

During mid-2015, Harper repeatedly voiced his opinion that Russia should be excluded from association with the G7 group of nations because of Russia&#x27;s support for Russian-speaking Ukrainian dissidents. On June 8, Harper said,&quot;Mr. Putin ... has no place at the [G7] table, and I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any leader who would defend Mr. Putin having a place.&quot;

Michael Ignatieff criticized Harper for cutting foreign aid to Africa by $700 million, falling short of the UN Millennium Development Goals, and cutting eight African countries from the list of priority aid recipients.

====Afghanistan====
On March 11 and 12, 2006, Harper made a surprise trip to Afghanistan, where Canadian Forces personnel had been deployed as part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force since late 2001, to visit troops in theatre as a show of support for their efforts, and as a demonstration of the government&#x27;s commitment to reconstruction and stability in the region. Harper&#x27;s choice of a first foreign visit was closely guarded from the press until his arrival in Afghanistan (citing security concerns), and is seen as marking a significant change in relationship between the government and the military. Harper returned to Afghanistan on May 22, 2007, in a surprise two-day visit which included visiting Canadian troops at the forward operating base at Ma&#x27;Sum Ghar, located south of Kandahar, making Harper the first prime minister to have visited the front lines of a combat operation.

====Israel====
Harper has shown admiration for Israel since the early 1990s. Friends and colleagues describe his views as being the product of thinking and reading deeply about the Middle East. Toronto rabbi Philip Scheim, who accompanied Harper to Israel in 2014 said, &quot;I sense that [Harper] sees Israel as a manifestation of justice and a righting of historical wrongs, especially in light of the Holocaust.&quot;

At the outset of the 2006 Israel–Lebanon conflict, Harper defended Israel&#x27;s &quot;right to defend itself&quot; and described its military campaign in Lebanon as a &quot;measured&quot; response, arguing that Hezbollah&#x27;s release of kidnapped Israel Defense Force (IDF) soldiers would be the key to ending the conflict. Speaking of the situation in both Lebanon and Gaza on July 18, Harper said he wanted &quot;not just a ceasefire, but a resolution&quot; but such a thing would not happen until Hezbollah and Hamas recognize Israel&#x27;s right to exist. Harper blamed Hezbollah for all the civilian deaths. He asserted that Hezbollah&#x27;s objective is to destroy Israel through violence.

The media noted that Harper did not allow reporters opportunities to ask him questions on his position. Some Canadians, including many Arab and Lebanese Canadians, criticized Harper&#x27;s description of Israel&#x27;s response.

In December 2008, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations recognized Harper&#x27;s support for Israel with its inaugural International Leadership Award, pointing out Harper&#x27;s decision to boycott the Durban II anti-racism conference, and his government&#x27;s &quot;support for Israel and [its] efforts at the U.N. against incitement and... the delegitimization of Israel&quot;.

In March 2009, Harper spoke at a Parliament Hill ceremony organized by Chabad-Lubavitch to honour the Jewish victims of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which included an attack on the Nariman House. He expressed condolences over the murder at Chabad&#x27;s Mumbai centre of Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivka. Harper described the killings as &quot;affronts to the values that unite all civilized people&quot;. Harper added that the quick instalment of a new rabbi at the Chabad centre in Mumbai as a signal that the Jewish people will &quot;never bow to violence and hatred&quot;.

In 2010, Canada lost a bid for a seat on the UN Security Council. While initially blaming the loss on his rival Ignatieff, Harper later said that it was due to his pro-Israeli stance. Harper then said that he would take a pro-Israeli stance, no matter what the political cost to Canada. Ignatieff criticized Harper&#x27;s stance as a &quot;mistake&quot;, saying Canada would be better able to defend Israel through the Security Council than from the sidelines and pointed out that it is the Security Council that will determine if sanctions are imposed on Iran. Ignatieff also accused Harper of steering the discussion away from implementing the two-state solution, and instead of rendering all discussion into a competition &quot;about who is Israel&#x27;s best friend&quot;.

Harper backed Israel&#x27;s 2014 war in Gaza and condemned Hamas. Harper said, &quot;It is evident that Hamas is deliberately using human shields to further terror in the region.&quot;

====Free trade with EFTA====
On June 7, 2007, the Conservative government announced it had finalized free trade negotiations with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Under this agreement, Canada increased its trade ties with Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. In 2006, the value of trade between these partners was $10.7 billion. Canada had originally begun negotiations with the EFTA on October 9, 1998, but talks broke down because of a disagreement over subsidies to shipyards in Atlantic Canada.

====United States====

Shortly after being congratulated by George W. Bush for his victory, Harper rebuked US Ambassador David Wilkins for criticizing the Conservatives&#x27; plans to assert Canada&#x27;s sovereignty over the Arctic Ocean waters with armed forces. Harper&#x27;s first meeting as prime minister with the US president occurred at the end of March 2006.

The government received American news coverage during the Democratic Party&#x27;s 2008 presidential primaries after the details of a conversation between Barack Obama&#x27;s economic advisor Austan Goolsbee, and Canadian diplomat Georges Rioux were revealed. Reportedly Goolsbee was reassuring the Canadians that Obama&#x27;s comments on potentially renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) were more political rhetoric than actual policy. The accuracy of these reports has been debated by both the Obama campaign and the Canadian government. The news came at a key time nearing the Ohio and Texas primaries, where perceptions among Democratic voters was (and is) that the benefits of the NAFTA agreement are dubious. Thus the appearance that Obama was not being completely forthright was attacked by his opponent Hillary Clinton.

ABC News reported that Harper&#x27;s chief of staff, Ian Brodie was responsible for the details reaching the hands of the media. Harper has denied that Brodie was responsible for the leak, and launched an investigation to find the source. The Opposition, as well as Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, criticized the government on the issue, stating they were trying to help the Republicans by helping Hillary Clinton win the Democratic nomination instead of Obama. They also alleged the leak would hurt relations with the United States if Obama ever were to become president. Obama was elected president in November. In February, Obama made his first foreign visit as the US president to Ottawa, in which he affirmed support for free trade with Canada, as well as complimenting Canada on its involvement in Afghanistan.

===Environmental policy===

From 2006 to 2010, Canadian greenhouse gas emissions fell from 749 to 726 Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq). From 1993 until 2006, during the previous Liberal government greenhouse gas emissions increased from 600 to 749 Mt of CO2 eq. The reduction corresponded to Canada&#x27;s decreased economic output during the Great Recession and emissions began increasing slightly in 2010, when the economy began recovering. Other significant factors in Canada&#x27;s decreased emissions during Harper&#x27;s tenure are initiatives such as the carbon tax in British Columbia, the cap and trade system in Quebec, Ontario discontinuing use of coal-fired power plants, and the Clean Air Regulatory Agenda which regulates emissions for automobiles and light trucks. In 2006, a &quot;Clean Air and Climate Change Act&quot; was proposed to address air pollution as well as greenhouse gas emissions; it never became law. In 2006, the Clean Air Regulatory Agenda (CARA) was established to &quot;support Government of Canada efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions in order to improve the environment and health of Canadians&quot;. 

In December 2011, the Harper government announced that Canada would formally withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol. Environment Minister Peter Kent stated, &quot;It&#x27;s now clear that Kyoto is not the path forward for a global solution to climate change.&quot; In December 2012, Canada became the first signatory to formally withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol.

====Renewable energy====
Other federal initiatives included the 2011 loan guarantee towards the Lower Churchill Project in Labrador. The Lower Churchill&#x27;s two hydroelectric installations at Gull Island and Muskrat Falls have a combined capacity of over  MW and have the ability to provide 16.7 TW·h of electricity per year, which is enough to &quot;reduce greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to taking 3.2 million vehicles off the road each year&quot;.

====Public transit====
In 2006, Harper introduced the &#x27;Public Transit Tax Credit&#x27;, where individuals could claim 15 per cent of the cost of a transit pass each year. From 2006 to 2013, the Harper government invested over $5 billion towards public transit projects in Canada. In 2006, the federal government provided $697 million towards the Toronto York–Spadina Subway Extension. In September 2013, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty announced a federal contribution of $660 million towards the Scarborough Subway Extension.

=== Transparency ===
Starting in 2006, the Harper government implemented policies that had the effect of reducing transparency. During this government, scientists employed by the government were not able to speak with the media and inform the public of their findings without government permission, the government made significant cuts to research and other forms of data collection, and significant destruction and inaccessibility of government-held data and documents occurred.

During the Harper government, it was not possible for government-employed scientists to openly speak about the government policy that prohibited communication with the media. However, following the election of a new government in 2015, several scientists who were or had been employed by the government came forward to confirm the allegations made by anonymous sources during the Harper years.

The government made drastic cuts to scientific research and data collection. Over 2,000 scientists were dismissed and funding was cut from world renowned research facilities. Cuts were also made to many essential programs, some so deep that they had to shut down entirely, including the monitoring of smoke stack emissions, food inspections, oil spills, water quality, and climate change. During this time, the long form census was also discontinued as a mandatory part of the census. This was ostensibly due to privacy concerns, however, the number of complaints about privacy proved to be minimal.
The government closed a number of government libraries without consultation on the closings or the process involved. The manner in which it was done received significant criticism because it left the remaining information in disarray, inaccessible for research.

===Appointments===
====Supreme Court====
Harper chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the Supreme Court of Canada:

* Marshall Rothstein (March 1, 2006 – August 31, 2015)
* Thomas Cromwell (September 5, 2008 – September 1, 2016)
* Andromache Karakatsanis (October 21, 2011 – present)
* Michael J. Moldaver (October 21, 2011 – September 1, 2022)
* Richard Wagner (October 5, 2012 – present)
* Clément Gascon (June 9, 2014 – September 15, 2019)
* Suzanne Côté (December 1, 2014 – present)
* Russell Brown (August 31, 2015 – June 12, 2023)

====Senate====
Harper, on January 29, 2010, advised the governor general to appoint new Conservative senators to fill five vacancies in the Senate, one each for Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and New Brunswick, and two for Ontario. The new senators were Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu, of Quebec; Bob Runciman, of Ontario; Vim Kochhar, of Ontario; Elizabeth Marshall of Newfoundland and Labrador; and Rose-May Poirier, of New Brunswick. This changed the party standings in the Senate, which had previously been dominated by Liberals, to 51 Conservatives, 49 Liberals, and five others.

==Post-premiership (2015–present)==
===Conservative backbencher (2015–2016)===
Harper returned to Ottawa as a Conservative backbencher and addressed a meeting of the Conservative caucus that included defeated MPs in November 2015. Interim leader Rona Ambrose stated that Harper would be in the House for key votes as the member for Calgary Heritage, but had earned the right to keep a low profile after his service as the prime minister. In February 2018, Harper stated that he could have still &quot;easily&quot; been leader of the Conservative Party, but he chose not to amass too much power in order to secure the party&#x27;s fortunes in the future.

In December 2015, Harper had set up Harper &amp; Associates Consulting Inc., a corporation that lists him a director alongside close associates Ray Novak and Jeremy Hunt.

Harper announced in May 2016 that he planned to resign his seat in the House of Commons during the summer before the fall session of Parliament. On May 26, 2016, he was named as a board member for the Conservative Party&#x27;s fundraising arm. The Conservative Fund is noted to have influence on the party operations. Harper and other directors played a role in the removal of Harper–appointed Conservative executive director Dustin Van Vught to avoid backlash from donors and grassroots conservatives. In the same month, Harper delivered a speech to the 2016 Conservative Party convention where his accomplishments as party leader and prime minister were honoured by the party.

===After politics (2016–present)===
In October 2017, Harper received media attention for criticizing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#x27;s handling of the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement started by the United States under President Donald Trump, stating that Trudeau was too unwilling to make concessions to the U.S., sided too closely with Mexico, and tried to advance left-wing policies through the renegotiations.

On February 2, 2018, Harper revealed in a statement that he knew about the sexual assault allegations against then Conservative MP Rick Dykstra during the 2015 election but could not justify removing him as a candidate because the investigation was closed by police a year before the election.

On March 26, 2018, Harper attended the international Fellowship of Christians and Jews Gala at Mar-a-Lago where he stated that he expressed support for US president Donald Trump&#x27;s speech on Jerusalem. On May 9, he expressed support for Trump&#x27;s decision to withdraw from the Iran deal by lending his signature to an ad that appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; a day after the decision.

On November 19, 2018, Harper appeared on a show hosted by Ben Shapiro, where he made comments on issues such as populism, immigration and nationalism. The &quot;National Post&quot; noted that they &quot;echo the argument made in his recently released book, &quot;Right Here, Right Now: Politics and Leadership in the Age of Disruption&quot;, which urges conservatives to listen to populist grievances, rather than focus on other priorities like tax cuts for the wealthy.&quot;

In January 2019, Harper appeared on a PragerU video explaining why Donald Trump was elected to the presidency in the 2016 United States election. Then in May 2019, he appeared on another PragerU video explaining reasons to support Israel amid the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

On March 11, 2021, during a virtual gathering hosted by the Conference of Defence Associations Institute, Harper claimed that the world has entered into a Second Cold War between the United States and China, and that middle-power countries such as Canada are also a part of the rivalry between the two main powers.

In 2021, Harper appeared on the podcast American Optimist, hosted by Joe Lonsdale. In the interview, Harper criticized the Trudeau government&#x27;s large-scale deficit spending during the COVID-19 pandemic, calling it &quot;overkill&quot;. He also criticized &quot;woke culture&quot;.

On July 25, 2022, Harper endorsed his former cabinet minister Pierre Poilievre for the leadership of the Conservative Party. This was the first time Harper endorsed a federal Conservative leadership candidate; he previously chose not to in the 2017 and 2020 leadership elections.

In September 2022, Harper attended Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s state funeral, along with other former Canadian prime ministers.

On March 22, 2023, during a conservative conference in Ottawa, Harper criticized the Trudeau government&#x27;s handling of Chinese government interference in the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections. He also criticized the NDP, calling them a &quot;branch plant of the Liberal party&quot; and argued that the party got &quot;nothing&quot; out of its confidence-and-supply agreement with the Liberal Party.

In April 2023, Harper endorsed Albertan Premier Danielle Smith for the 2023 Albertan provincial election.

In November 2024, Harper was named as Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo) Chair by Premier Danielle Smith.

==Honours==
 

Harper received the Woodrow Wilson Award on October 6, 2006, for his public service in Calgary. The awards ceremony was held at the Telus Convention Centre in Calgary, the same place where he made his victory speech.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine also named him as Canada&#x27;s Newsmaker of the Year in 2006. Stephen Handelman wrote &quot;that the prime minister who was once dismissed as a doctrinaire backroom tactician with no experience in government has emerged as a warrior in power&quot;.

On June 27, 2008, Harper was awarded the Presidential Gold Medallion for Humanitarianism by B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith International. He is the first Canadian to be awarded this medal.

On July 11, 2011, Harper was honoured by Alberta&#x27;s Blood tribe. He was made Honorary Chief of the Kainai Nation during a ceremony, in which they recognized him for making an official apology on behalf of the Government of Canada for the residential schools abuse. Harper issued this apology in 2008. The chief of the tribe explained that he believes the apology officially started the healing and rebuilding of relations between the federal and native councils. Lester B. Pearson, John Diefenbaker, and Jean Chrétien are the only other prime ministers of Canada to have been awarded the same honorary title.

On September 27, 2012, Harper received the World Statesman of the Year award. This award was offered through a US group of various faith representatives. This occurred at a black tie banquet in New York. Jean Chrétien was one of the previous recipients from Canada.

In August 2016 President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine awarded Stephen Harper with the highest award for foreigners–the Order of Liberty.

In December 2019, it was announced by Governor General Julie Payette that Harper had been appointed as a Companion of the Order of Canada. He was formally invested on September 18, 2022, by Governor General Mary Simon in London in a ceremony attended by incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and former prime ministers Kim Campbell, Jean Chrétien, Paul Martin and former Governors-General Michaëlle Jean and David Johnston.

In 2023, he was appointed a Member of the Alberta Order of Excellence, the province&#x27;s civilian honour for merit.

==Personal life==

Harper married Laureen Teskey on December 11, 1993. Laureen was formerly married to New Zealander Neil Fenton from 1985 to 1988. The Harpers have two children: Benjamin and Rachel. Harper is the third prime minister, after Pierre Trudeau and John Turner, to send his children to Rockcliffe Park Public School, in Ottawa.

In the late 1980s, he became an evangelical Christian, a member of RockPointe Church (Christian and Missionary Alliance) in Bearspaw, a suburb of Calgary, Alberta. After moving to Ottawa in 2003, he became a member of East Gate Alliance Church.

An avid follower of ice hockey, he has been a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs since his childhood in the Leaside and Etobicoke communities in Toronto. Harper is also a fan of the Calgary Flames. He published a book, &quot;A Great Game: The Forgotten Leafs and the Rise of Professional Hockey&quot; (2013), which chronicles the growth of professional hockey, particularly in Toronto, and writes articles occasionally on the subject. Harper appeared on The Sports Network (TSN) during the broadcast of the Canada–Russia final of the 2007 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. He was interviewed and expressed his views on the state of hockey and his preference for an overtime period in lieu of a shoot-out. In February 2010, Harper interviewed former National Hockey League greats Wayne Gretzky and Gordie Howe for a Saskatoon Kinsmen Club charity event.

Harper had a cameo appearance in an episode of the television show &quot;Corner Gas,&quot; which aired March 12, 2007. In October 2010, he taped a cameo appearance in an episode of the television show &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot;, which aired July 20, 2011, during the show&#x27;s fourth season.

Harper owns an extensive vinyl record collection and is a fan of The Beatles and AC/DC. In October 2009, he joined Yo-Yo Ma on stage in a National Arts Centre gala and performed &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;. He was also accompanied by Herringbone, an Ottawa band with whom he regularly practices. He received a standing ovation after providing the piano accompaniment and lead vocals for the song. Harper was part of a band called The Van Cats, a pun on &quot;vingt-quatre&quot; (&quot;24&quot; in French), referring to the prime ministerial residence of 24 Sussex Drive.

He was the first prime minister to employ a personal stylist, Michelle Muntean, whose duties range from coordinating his clothing to preparing his hair and makeup for speeches and television appearances. While she used to be on the public payroll, she has been paid for by the Conservative Party since &quot;some time [in] 2007&quot;.

As of 2013, the Harper family had two cats, Stanley and Gypsy. They have fostered other cats as well.

<text>A milkshake (sometimes simply called a shake) is a sweet beverage made by blending milk, ice cream, and flavorings or sweeteners such as butterscotch, caramel sauce, chocolate syrup, or fruit syrup into a thick, sweet, cold mixture. It may also be made using a base made from non-dairy products, including plant milks such as almond milk, coconut milk, or soy milk. Dry ingredients such as whole fruit, nuts, seeds, candy, or cookies may be incorporated.

Milkshakes originated in the United States around the turn of the 20th century, and grew in popularity following the introduction of electric blenders in the subsequent two decades. They became a common part of youth popular culture, as ice cream shops were a culturally acceptable meeting place for youth, and milkshakes became symbolic of the innocence of youth.

==Preparation==

Full-service restaurants, ice cream shops, soda fountains, and diners usually prepare the shake in a milkshake machine. At home, a blender is more commonly used. Milkshakes can also be mixed by hand using a spoon. Milkshakes may be made from any flavor of ice cream; additional flavorings, such as chocolate syrup, malt syrup, or malted milk powder, are often added prior to mixing.

Many fast food outlets do not make shakes from the individual ingredients; rather, they use automatic milkshake machines which freeze and serve a pre-made milkshake mixture consisting of milk, a sweetened flavoring agent, and a thickening agent. These are similar to soft-serve ice cream machines, but they keep the shake at a drinkable consistency.

==Terminology==
Terminology around the distinction between a milkshake that uses ice cream and other forms of flavored milk varies regionally. An ice cream-based milkshake may be called a &quot;thick shake&quot; to distinguish it. In parts of New England and eastern Canada, the name &quot;frappe&quot; ( ) is used. Rhode Island residents sometimes refer to milkshakes as &quot;cabinets&quot;. A milkshake containing malted milk powder is sometimes called a &quot;malt&quot;. The term &quot;concrete&quot; is used for particularly thick milkshakes that do not spill when turned upside down, such as those offered by the restaurant chain Culver&#x27;s.

In some jurisdictions there are legal requirements about what can be called a &quot;milkshake&quot;, such as requirements for the percentage presence of milk fat and non-fat milk solids. Because of this, it is common for restaurants to avoid using the term &quot;milkshake&quot; to refer to their products, such as simply calling them &quot;shakes&quot; rather than &quot;milkshakes&quot;. Fast food restaurants that do not refer to their similar products as &quot;milkshakes&quot; include Wendy&#x27;s (which calls their product a &quot;Frosty&quot;), Burger King, Dairy Queen, Del Taco, McDonald&#x27;s, Shake Shack, and Sonic Drive-In.

==History==
===1880s–1930s===
When the term &quot;milkshake&quot; was first used in print in 1885, a milkshake was an alcoholic whiskey drink that has been described as a &quot;sturdy, healthful eggnog type of drink, with eggs, whiskey, etc., served as a tonic as well as a treat&quot;. However, by 1900, the term referred to &quot;wholesome drinks made with chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla syrups&quot;. By the &quot;early 1900s people were asking for the new treat, often with ice cream&quot;. By the 1930s, milkshakes were a popular drink at malt shops, which were the &quot;typical soda fountain of the period ... used by students as a meeting place or hangout&quot;.

The history of the electric blender, malted milk drinks, and milkshakes are interconnected. Before the widespread availability of electric blenders, milkshake-type drinks were more like eggnog, or they were a hand-shaken mixture of crushed ice and milk, sugar, and flavorings. Hamilton Beach introduced its Cyclone Drink Mixer in 1910, and it was widely used in soda fountains.

The Hamilton Beach design, with the motor on top, remains the most common kind of milkshake machine. In 1922, Steven Poplawski invented the bottom-motor blender, which is sometimes used for making milkshakes. With the invention of the blender, milkshakes began to take their modern, whipped, aerated, and frothy form.

The use of malted milk powder in milkshakes was popularized in the US by the Chicago drugstore chain Walgreens. Malted milk powder – a mixture of evaporated milk, malted barley, and wheat flour – was invented by William Horlick in 1897 for use as an easily digested restorative health drink for disabled people and children, and as an infant&#x27;s food. However, healthy people soon began drinking beverages made with malted milk simply for the taste, and malted milk beverages containing milk, chocolate syrup, and malt powder became a standard offering at soda fountains. In 1922, Walgreens employee Ivar &quot;Pop&quot; Coulson made a milkshake by adding two scoops of vanilla ice cream to the standard malted milk drink recipe. This item, under the name &quot;Horlick&#x27;s Malted Milk&quot;, was featured by the Walgreen drugstore chain as part of a chocolate milkshake, which itself became known as a &quot;malted&quot; or &quot;malt&quot; and became one of the most popular soda-fountain drinks.

The automation of milkshakes developed in the 1930s, after the invention of freon-cooled refrigerators provided a safe, reliable way of automatically making and dispensing ice cream. In 1936, inventor Earl Prince used the basic concept behind the Freon-cooled automated ice cream machine to develop the Multimixer, a &quot;five-spindled mixer that could produce five milkshakes at once, all automatically, and dispense them at the pull of a lever into awaiting paper cups&quot;.

Newspaper articles from the late 1930s suggest the term &#x27;frosted&#x27; was sometimes used to refer to milkshakes, particularly those made with ice cream. In 1937, the &quot;Denton Journal&quot; in Maryland stated that &quot;For a &#x27;frosted&#x27; shake, add a dash of your favorite ice cream.&quot; In 1939, the &quot;Mansfield News&quot; in Ohio stated that &quot;A frosted beverage, in the vernacular, is something good to which ice cream has been added. Example par excellence is frosted coffee –that hot, tasty beverage made chilly with ice and frosty with ice cream.&quot;

===1940s–1950s===
By the 1950s, popular places to drink milkshakes were Woolworth&#x27;s &quot;5 &amp; 10&quot; lunch counters, diners, burger joints, and drugstore soda fountains. These establishments often prominently displayed a shining chrome or stainless steel milkshake mixing machine.

These establishments made milkshakes in Hamilton Beach or similar styles of drink mixers, which had spindles and agitators that folded air into the drinks for &quot;smooth, fluffy results&quot; and served them in tall glasses with bulbous top. Soda fountain staff had their own jargon, such as &quot;Burn One All the Way&quot; (chocolate malted with chocolate ice cream), &quot;Twist It, Choke It, and Make It Cackle&quot; (chocolate malted with an egg), &quot;Shake One in the Hay&quot; (a strawberry shake), and a &quot;White Cow&quot; (a vanilla milkshake). In the 1950s, a milkshake machine salesman named Ray Kroc bought exclusive rights to the 1930s-era Multimixer milkshake maker from inventor Earl Prince, and went on to use automated milkshake machines to speed up production at McDonald&#x27;s restaurants. 

Milkshakes had also become popular in other parts of the world, including the United Kingdom and Australia. In Australia, milk bars had grown popular and milkshakes were normally served lightly whipped and often in the aluminum or stainless steel cups in which they were prepared. In addition to more traditional flavors, spearmint and lime-flavored milkshakes became popular in Australia.

===2000s–present===
In 2006, the U.S. Agricultural Research Service developed reduced-sugar, low-fat milk shakes for lunch programs. The shakes have half the sugar and only 10% of the fat of commercial fast-food shakes. Schools need a milk shake machine or soft-serve ice cream machine to serve the milkshakes. The milkshakes also have added fiber and other nutrients and reduced levels of lactose, which makes the shakes suitable for some people with lactose intolerance.

U.S. sales of milkshakes, malts, and floats rose 11% in 2006, according to the industry research firm NPD Group. Christopher Muller, the director of the Center for Multi-Unit Restaurant Management at Orlando&#x27;s University of Central Florida said that &quot;milkshakes remind us of summer, youth – and indulgence&quot;, and &quot;they&#x27;re evocative of a time gone by&quot;.
Muller stated that milkshakes are an &quot;enormously profitable&quot; item for restaurants, since the drinks contain so much air. The market research firm Technomic states that about 75% of the average-priced $3.38 restaurant shake in 2006 was profit. An executive from Sonic Drive-In, a U.S. chain of 1950s-style diner restaurants, calls shakes &quot;one of our highest-volume, revenue-producing areas&quot;.

A 2016 article stated that chefs are trying out innovative ideas with milkshakes to keep customers interested in the drinks. The article noted that coffee-flavored shakes are popular &quot;because it complements both sweet and savory&quot; dishes. Another trend is using different types of milk, such as almond milk, coconut milk, soy milk, or hemp milk.

==Use in protests==

In May 2019, during the build-up to the EU parliament elections in the United Kingdom, the throwing of milkshakes emerged as a protest tactic, usually targeting right-wing politicians. The movement originated with the &quot;milkshaking&quot; of Tommy Robinson, with a second thrown later that month.

The UK police requested that an Edinburgh McDonald&#x27;s refrain from selling milkshakes on May 17 during a visit by Nigel Farage. This prompted Burger King to tweet in response: &quot;We&#x27;re selling milkshakes all weekend. Have fun.&quot; Burger King&#x27;s tweet was later banned by the UK&#x27;s Advertising Standards Authority, because they felt that it &quot;condoned the previous anti-social behaviour and encouraged further instances&quot;, and that it was therefore an &quot;irresponsible&quot; advertisement. At a separate visit in Newcastle on May 20, Farage had a Five Guys milkshake thrown at him. Carl Benjamin had a total of four milkshakes thrown at him that week. The act of milkshaking is similar to that of egging as a form of protest against political figures.

==In popular culture==
Filmmakers sometimes utilize milkshakes as a visual shorthand for themes of purity, innocence, and uncorrupted youth, representing them as embodiments of &#x27;sweetness and goodness. In &quot;All About Eve&quot;, by director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Bette Davis&#x27;s character is unhappy to see a man she likes chatting up her young female assistant, so Davis&#x27;s character orders an alcoholic Martini, and &quot;then mockingly suggests [that] Eve [the young assistant] will have a milkshake&quot;, thereby &quot;asserting womanhood over girlhood through milkshake&#x27;s associations with virginity&quot;. Similarly, the socially awkward character Steve Buscemi plays in &quot;Ghost World&quot; is made fun of by a teenage girl because he orders a &quot;virginal vanilla milkshake&quot;; in &quot;Manhattan&quot;, by director Woody Allen, the director draws attention to the difference in age between his 42-year-old character (he also acts in the lead role) and his teenage girlfriend by having her drink a milkshake. In the film &quot;Lolita&quot; in 1997, a teenage girl drinks a milkshake while she is with the middle-aged man (her mother&#x27;s new boyfriend) who is attracted to her. 

The characters from Archie Comics are often depicted drinking milkshakes. The TV series &quot;Riverdale&quot;, inspired by the comics, depicts the characters in a 1950s-inspired local diner, Pop&#x27;s Chock&#x27;lit Shoppe; to promote the show, the cast shared a milkshake during an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;.

Master Shake, one of the main characters from the American animated series &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; (also known by various alternative titles), is a life-sized anthropomorphic milkshake.

In Kelis&#x27; 2003 hit single &quot;Milkshake&quot; the name of beverage is repeated throughout the song. Milkshakes are prominently featured in the song&#x27;s video clip, which features characters consuming them in a diner.

The term &quot;Milkshake Duck&quot;, coined on Twitter in 2017, refers to a person who initially becomes popular on social media, only to become disgraced as other users comb through their online presence and find offensive statements or an unpleasant history.
